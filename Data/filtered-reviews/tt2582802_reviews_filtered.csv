" its not just about success
",2021-03-29 00:00:00,10,"Ive watched again and again... but somehow the 1st time always gave me certain one-timer feelings. Whiplash is going to give you several interpretations but mine will always be POV. In other words, personal perspectives. The fletcher concept of success represents a category of successful people. People who say thing about achieving personal goals with their own rules. STRICT RULES. Imo, i do get some motivation sense still after 10th time seeing it. The only regret is not seeing in theater. Yet they say a perfect movie doesnt exist."
" Don't Be A Quitter
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,8,"A young lad chasing a dream of being a drummer faces the brutal reality of playing with the big dogs. This isn't a style of music I enjoy but watching the effort put into doing it is engaging, and better yet watching their drill Sargent teacher giving them hell is very entertaining. This film shows an example of what it takes to be great at something you love doing in life and whether or not you're willing to go the distance. The ending is a lovely pay-off."
" Wrong message
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,5,"5 stars (out of 5) for the performance and 0 stars for the message. There is a huge difference between being strict and being encouraging your students to have more perseverance and that they should give a better work through more training and between being the person who is demeaning his students and insulting them and psychologically manipulating them in the aim that he is trying to get out the best of them. Even if he gets at the end one unique, successful student, the amount of other students who have now psychological problems due to his approach cannot give him an execuse."
" Whip Crack Away!
",2021-03-25 00:00:00,3,"I could really appreciate the artistic passion and musicality of this film although just watching what Neiman goes through made me pretty tense.
The idea of the film is great, sort of like a very extreme 'Glee' or 'Fame', but I think that it is actually a bit too extreme. Their are times where I feel that Fletcher should have seen what he was doing and laid off a bit. His behaviour was so abhorrent, even without these moments, that his teaching practices should have been called in to question anyway. It would have worked better then, because that is where it became unbelievable in my eyes. I'm sure that there are many teachers of a similar ilk out there, but I'm not convinced that they would ever get away with that abuse for so long.A tamer version could work really well and might actually resemble an episode of 'Glee' or 'Fame', but I don't think it would need to be dumber down too much and could really get the point across without giving the audience anxiety on Neiman's behalf.The actors all do a very good job. J.K. Simmons is the obvious stand out performer, but Miles Teller puts in a lot of hard work too.I like the lighting of the film, I think the darkness references the hard times for Neiman and the Jazz music is just superb.It's an odd one, because in some weird way I did enjoy it, but it was hard to digest at the same time."
" An Unexpected Masterpiece
",2021-03-23 00:00:00,9,"When I first saw the trailer I was anything but impressed but after I watched the movie I knew I watched a masterpiece. With Chazelle at the helm he produces us with true piece of art. This movie is emotionally investing, adrenaline rushing and awe inspiring. JK Simmons easily shows up with the best performance of his career and Miles Teller is also great in the lead. There's something about a movie where a student has to overcome and prove his harsh and abusive teacher wrong, its safe to say that this movie has one of the best endings vie watched in recent memories."
" A beautiful and intense chaos that combines passion, obsession, and perfectionism.
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,9,"« Whiplash» has become an international success directed by Damien Chazelle who was only 29 years old this exhilarating masterpiece hit the cinemas in 2014, and now, at the grand old age of 30, he has already been nominated for a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar and looks set for a long and prosperous career, all thanks to the phenomenal and success of his drummer, Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) and drumming teacher Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). This fascinating movie will absolutely put you through a roller coaster of emotions. Being a classic music lover and an instrument player myself, I related to the endless pressure and frustration, as well as the ambition and dedication that the passion for music requires. It got me completely swallowed inside, especially due to the amazing character development and performance throughout the movie. This movie made me question what the crazy desire for success can actually do to someone. What is life really about? Does being THE best really matter? Is that what happiness is?
This movie emphasizes the harsh reality in the music's business, what does it take to be THE best? Andrew, a first-year student at a prestigious conservatory in New York City, goes through series of pain, frustration and craziness, and his ultimate goal is to be the best jazz drummer of all times, it is everything that matters to him, unless we will never be satisfied. He gets so absorbed in his pursuit to be remembered that it literally drives him crazy. We even have the strict teacher, Fletcher, challenging him, pushing him even more. His methods to do this are, however, questionable. Fletcher seems to think greatness is either cultivated or it is wasted. Andrew works so hard it literally destroys his hands. I can feel however that, behind the intense hate and anger they feel for each other, there's this part of them that understand one another, the same insane perspective of what life is about, of what it takes to be the absolute best, this understanding develops and becomes clearer throughout the movie. Fletcher puts everything on the line to bring out the potential in his students, and Andrew stands out as we can see him becoming more and more blinded by his determination to achieve the top. This movie showed me how a simple passion can easily consume you, how a simple ambition can become an obsession and drive you crazy.It is somewhat a toxic relationship between Andrew and Fletcher, it really depends on how you see it. Despite Fletcher's heartless and harsh methods of teaching, we later find out that his intentions are more pure that we expected, he wants to intensify the potential of his students. We can see Andrew's progress and evolution throughout the movie, thanks to his challenging professor, however he puts him through hell. This is best emphasized in the movie by the use of colours, the light made a strong impression. This hell metaphor is expressed by warm colours, yellow and orange domination when Fletcher and Andrew are in presence of one another, enhancing, on one side the pain and suffering felt by Andrew but on the other side the controversy in Fletcher's way of teaching. This orange aesthetic indeed feels like hell, it shows the intensity and hate in most when they are both in direct contact, it feels like a burning atmosphere, again like hell. Andrew even has a moment where he tells Fletcher 'where is the line? When do you go too far and discourage people from playing at all?'. Andrew's rage is also resonates with the strong orange but it can also represent how Fletcher challenges him, how his life becomes more complete with something to fight for. This movie is basically a pot of water getting hotter and hotter until it boils over.
What are people willing to sacrifice to become the best? I would have liked to have learned why this was so important to Andrew. A lot of people are satisfied with the simple things, but not him, success was his only life purpose. A beautiful and intense chaos that combines passion, obsession, and perfectionism. A movie that will make you forget where you are."
" The world has moved on
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,1,A story of abuse but lessons learned too late. Athlete A nails the story with much more craft.
" trash
",2021-03-18 00:00:00,1,Literally trash. couldn't sit through the whole thing.
" Totally Unrealistic
",2021-03-17 00:00:00,2,"Totally unrealistic. Since when has jazz been bound by having to stick to a strict tempo? It's not music for ballroom dancing for goodness sake. The whole point of jazz is that it is supposed to allow the player freedom.
A good jazz drummer will know when to push the beat and when to hold back.
The last few minutes are truly awful where Andrew unilaterally decides to build a shed(derogatory term for a drum solo) which ultimately gets Fletcher on his side.
As a jazz fan I hated it."
" WHIPLASH!!!
",2021-03-17 00:00:00,9,"""Whiplash"". Written and directed by the fairly unknown, up & coming ""Damien Chazelle"" Who is recently known for his involvement in ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" & ""First Man"".
Staring ""Miles Teller"" & ""JK. Simmons"" this picture is set in modern day New York City, centring around a university for music/arts. ""JK. Simmons"" plays a Jazz teacher ""Fletcher"" and ""Miles Teller"" is our sensitive protagonist & one of ""Fletchers"" many students, ""Andrew"".
My favourite aspect of this movie is the intensely brutal and sometimes awkward atmosphere created by the collision of these two characters. The tension is formed through the cinematography, dialogue and the excellent performances alone. ""JK. Simons"" Is ridiculously intimidating in this role, constantly pushing the ambitions and emotions of ""Tellers"" character to absolute breaking point with his ferocious temper and teaching methods. The scenes are performed so well it's as if you're sat in the rehearsal room/concert hall with these characters. ""Miles Teller"" also plays the drums for real which makes the performance that more realistic and captivating for the audience.
I watched this movie upon release back in (2015), I'm not an avid fan of Jazz music but after my initial viewing I could admit I gained a new found appreciation for the genre and have since rewatched the movie 4 times. It's value unsurprisingly never decreases after a revisit which is a testament to how groundbreaking ""Whiplash"" truly is. I highly recommend👌🏼"
" To push relentlessly for a perfection few will ever appreciate...
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,7,"Miles Teller is simply superb in this story. His is the hugely emotionally charged depiction of ""Andrew"", a young student with a desire to be a great drummer, His practicing attracts the attention of teacher ""Fletcher"" (JK Simmons) and what ensues are a frequently tortuous series of encounters as the latter pushes the younger man to the limits of his patience, his endurance and of his physical potentialities too! Simmons picked up an Oscar for his role as the mentor - a man whose behaviour bordered on the brutal at times - but I could have been doing with a little more of his own backstory to legitimise what was, frankly, completely unacceptable behaviour for anyone in an educational environment. The remainder of the film belongs to Teller though, and I found myself completely engrossed in his quest for perfection for himself, but also to impress and satisfy his musical nemesis. At times you can almost see his hatred; you certainly see the blood, sweat and tears! It's a salutary lesson for the many of us who just assume the drummer is the person at the back making a racket, and the final few scenes are as good as any we will ever see in a film about music, or anything else. At times the plot is too far fetched, and that let's up on the intensity on occasion (the car crash, for example) but all told, I think this is a cracker of a film."
" Superb cast, intensely built and a brilliant movie
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,8,"As a self proclaimed movie buff and a jazz fan, the subject of this movie intrigued me from the start. Whilst the story of a promising young talent pushed to the limits by an uncompromising mentor is not new, there were so many things about this movie that sets it apart from regular ones.The performances for a start are brilliant, especially the leading two actors. Both believable and intense throughout.The direction style was somewhat different. There was no reliance on emotive music, visual flair or any other gimmicks. The blood and sweat (both metaphorically speaking and otherwise) were captured without tricks.The dialog was also fresh and subtle. The making of a great movie relies on capturing human emotions without expressive words or over-acting and this movie had it in abundance.The psychological twists completely caught me off guard as well, which is no easy task. Jazz and rock lovers must see the movie, but I think it's powerful enough for anyone who enjoys subtlety and psychology of the human mind.Overall, I think the movie worked because it felt real and raw. I came away a little shocked, a little inspired and very impressed. Superb movie and hats off to those involved in the making of it."
" Better than Lalaland
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,9,"I think this is this writer's best movie tbh. The music in Lalaland is more enjoyable, but the this movie is just so much better. The shots are beautifully intimate, and the color use is particularly impressive. Idk the whole movie was eye candy, and I just love watching a movie that's makers have such a grasp on emotion and storytelling. I'm also a musician who developed most of my skill in a (fortunately) less harsh but definitely very similar environment, so this movie was really relatable to me. It is truly a remarkable movie."
" Nice
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,10,"Very nice movie.
I love this. I watch this movie very often"
" But Is It Worth It?
",2021-03-08 00:00:00,8,"On the surface this film is pretty grim - tense situations - major characters who are presented as maniacal self-involved jerks - certainly NOT a romantic comedy. Although Fletcher is presented as an oppressive tyrant - we see in a couple of scenes that off-the job he can be kind and ""human"". Is the tyrant just a role he plays? - to achieve an objective? On the other hand Andrew does not show many signs of humanity - but is still likable since he is the victim of Fletcher's fury. I think the writer/director is trying to make a point - or a few points. The film has so many underlying themes I am not sure what point(s) the writer/director was trying to make. Certainly one point is that to be great or at the top in any endeavor or profession - dedication and sacrifice are required. I think many people will be willing to stop there. But lurking in the shadows is the big question - is it worth it? When you consider the sacrifices made by both major characters in pursuit of their goals- for most rational people the answer would be ""NO"". There was a similar theme in the film ""La La Land"" - which was by the same writer/director - Damien Chazelle. And both films featured some really good jazz. Although I knew who Buddy Rich was before I saw this film - I wonder how many other viewers did. Something to think about."
" A beautifully-written film with a strong message
",2021-03-08 00:00:00,9,"Whiplash is about a young student who strives to be a world-class drummer, guided by a brutal music teacher. It conveys many messages such as to never give up, follow your dreams, but remain balanced. The performances are out of this world, particularly J.K. Simmons' performance, which earned him the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. And the technical quality is also great; Whiplash won Oscars for Best Film Editing and Sound, has a decent cinematography and the directing by Damien Chazelle is great. To sum up, Whiplash is a movie you must watch."
" 10/10
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,10,"I declare Whiplash the best film of the 2010s.The character relationship of Andrew & Fletcher is one of the most memorable in recent memory. The film is punctuated by two moments that symbolize the themes of Andrews and all of our lives: love, that being his conversation with Nicole in the diner on how she would jeopardize his career, and hard work, that being Fletcher and Andrew in the jazz club debating what it would take to be the next great. Both relatable. Something that may be on our conscience. As for the form, it doesn't get sharper than this. The directing style doesn't miss a beat - no pun intended.This is art that doesn't lie or flatter.Incredible debut from Damien Chazelle at 28-years-old!"
" It's just an amazing movie.
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,10,"And let me start by saying: Whiplash is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Everything is so damn perfect, I almost wanted a sequel. But that would ruined this movie, so I think I'm good. This is everything what a movie should be.I've only seen two drum movies: This one, and The Rocker. This is, with no doubt, the best. This is so amazing, fantastic, perfect, and extremely brilliant. Whiplash is a masterpiece from start to finish.Whiplash makes you want to hop on a drum set, and just play out loud. I've actually played drums in 8 years, and has the opportunity to do that. It motivates and inspires drummers around the world, and makes them want to be better at drumming, even if they don't like to practice. This is one of the most rewatchable movies of all time, and surprisingly enough, I have only seen the movie twice. It's soon time to rewatch this masterpiece (I'm sorry for using the same words to describe this movie, but there is only a few words to explain it, and every one of them is positive).Now, let's talk about the acting. Wow... The acting. No wonder why J.K. Simmons got an Oscar for this. It's not many people in this movie, and few of them I actually knows who are. You've got J. Jonah Jameson in one of the best supporting roles I have ever seen (and he's not very supporting in the movie). Then you have Reed Richards aka Mr Fantastic (2015), in the amazing lead role. Much better than Fantastic Four. And then you have Supergirl in some scenes, but she's not important. She's in the shadow of great talents like Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons.This is probably the best movie of 2014, with close follow-ups by The Grand Budapest Hotel and Birdman. And everyone was cheering in the finale, cause that's one of the best finales I've seen too (especially the editing).I really recommend checking this out. And if you don't like this movie, I will literally come to your house and kill you in your sleep. Nah, I'm just kidding. Or am I? Anyway, check this movie out."
" J K Simmons crushed it
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,8,This film has some amazing acting. J K Simmons presence created a nervous tension. His dialouge in the film is incredible. Miles Teller also does a great job in this film. The ending is very powerful and phenomenal scene as well.
" One of the smartest movies I've ever seen
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,10,"This movie absolutely left me in shock,my favorite part of this movie is the mind game between fletcher and Andrew,them constantly sabotaging one another,trying to make the other look bad, how they both are out to get one another when there both in the same room,absolutely fantastic and frankly is a once in a life time experience when it comes to witnessing a movie as smart as this,next is the acting,probably the most widely praised part of the film,but it can't be understated how brilliant everyone in this film is,ik Simmons and miles frankly give two of the best performances I've ever seen,next I wanna talk about the characters,another incredibly strong element of this film,I've talked about the mind games but this film goes deeper then that,it explores fletchers obsession with absolutely nothing but perfection and how that mindset starts to be a big part of Andrews personality due to being around flitch,Andrew starts the film as this pretty nice and normal teenager,and ends up a egotistical near physcopath who's willing to do anything for success,next the music,don't got much to say other then it's absolutely amazing,and one final point near the end of the film,I was very curious/worried how they would handle the climax,and omg it was the most spine chilling climax I've ever seen,please for your own sake watch this movie,especially if your a music lover like me."
" Drumming Masterpiece
",2021-02-25 00:00:00,10,"Andrew Niemann is a promising young drummer has dreams of becoming a great jazz musician. So he enrolls and is accepted into the best school for music in the country, Shaffer Conservatory of Music. Entrance into the school also means Andrew has a chance of entering the tutelage of Terrance Fletcher, the studio band teacher and head of the band that represents the school in jazz competitions. Fletcher is highly regarded for his skill in anything jazz and teaching talents, also a man with a ruthless reputation for his certain teaching methods. Fletcher is known to bring the best ability out of his students but that is achieved by the intimidation and belittling of his students as he strives for perfection each and every note no exceptions, this creates a pretty hostile environment that not many can endure. Andrew sticks with this as he has no musical pedigree and he believes this may be his only chance to truly prove his worth. While the tension is always unbearable Andrew will quite literally stop at nothing to achieve his goal, blood, callused hands, & car crashes be damned.
I was pleasantly surprised the first time i saw this film, an exciting drumming movie! The on screen connection between Miles Teller & J.K. Simmons is very strong and the movie really sets out to portray a very tense vibe between the two. Very inventive cinematic elements with color and camera work that really gives this film a whole Jazz feel to it. The plot and script leave a little to be desired but the incredibly real drumming talent Miles Teller has makes up for that along with Simmons' very intimidating nature you really focus on those two grippingly. Never before have we seen Jazz on screen with such visceral beauty."
" Lots of floors, but I don't care!
",2021-02-23 00:00:00,9,"The colour correction through the movie is magical. Changes from almost matrix green to a warm yellow all depending on the setting and how the characters are feeling and interacting with the setting.
The way the movie is shot has this air of improvisation. This is clearly reflective of the jazz they're playing. It's truly a delight to watch as it takes risks having these constant movie shots but boy does it work out.
The writing may not have the snarky genius of pulp fiction or the departed but every line has double, triple meanings packed with subtext and means something to further the plot.
The editing with the little jumps is scary despite just showing music it scares you because of the editing and also because of the fear and angst you gave towards the conductor.
The plot is the only thing letting this movie down. By that I mean it's all over the place. There's not enough foreshadowing or anything to set up some of the plot points.
There is supposedly a romantic subplot, which is clearly alluded to at the start of the film but they spend no more than 3 scenes on it. This pisses me off as it tried to show what an obsession can do to those around you, but it did not develop it enough and so it took away from the movie rather than adding onto it.
None of the acting in the movie is particularly stand out. JK Simmons is the best of the two it centred around but he really just played himself. Miles Teller is fine, nothing special but he either can play the drums or did a really good job of faking it. The scenes Melissa Benoit is in, she takes over the scene entirely with little to no dialogue. This further supports my point of the romantic subplot needing to be fullfilled. The movie is targeted to 15 and above so you can do over 2 hours, which this movie really could have used to fill all the plot points. The family plot and everything. Also the ending is brilliant but then he shouldn't have included the scene where he calls Nicole if it wasn't going to play out.
Like I said the ending feels deep and meaningful, bringing a whole arc to Andrew and basically summing up the movie of how music can make a difference in the lives of others.
The plot holes don't annoy you too much as the movie is more a love letter to jazz than a whole movie about the protagonist, him just being a medium we see it through.
Obviously the music is majestic.
It's filled with holes, the plot must be just all out of whack, but the rest of it is so special and magical that you do not care."
" Wow.
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,9,It's one of the best. I really enjoyed the movie and actors were awesome.
" Excellent music movie and character study
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,10,"One of the most intense movies. Takes the ""unstoppable force immovable object"" scenario and places is in a college music program. By the end of the movie I want to start it over again."
" Everything you ever want out of this film
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,10,"This film was great from beginning to end. With star studded acting for all the actors , this film was phenomenal. JK Simmons acting made the film really terrifying and it was amazing!This film is everything you would want. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to succeed in a specific are of interest as the story is quite inspiring for people who dream to be great at something."
" Can't stop thinking about this wonderful film
",2021-02-19 00:00:00,10,"Am writing this to try and stop thinking about this fantastic film. It won't leave my head after watching it yesterday from my sofa. Put it on as something to pass the time while I was doing the ironing, then had difficulty getting to sleep last night I was so caught up in it.The performances are wonderful. I find it hard to believe that the lead, Miles Teller is an 'actor', or that he has done other films - he inhabited the lead character to such a degree.One point other reviews I've read have not focused on is the portrayal of the relationship between the protagonist and his father (Paul Reiser). There are just a very few scenes, eating popcorn mostly, but that, and what we learn of their family, made the whole film so much more dramatic for me. The final hug was very powerful.So, characters - great. Acting - great. The plot also sizzles with some great twists. After they begin to come I had no idea where it was going, or where I wanted it to go. I had to stop the film at the climax, it was just too tense, and then came back to it the following evening.And it almost made me like jazz music.10 out of 10 out of 10."
" An All-Time Favourite
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,10,"Damien Chazelle's debut film is phenomenally directed and intense to watch from start to finish, but what I really love is how well the film captures Neiman's drive and motivation for drumming. Despite everything Fletcher puts him through during the film, he still chases his dream right until the end, and it's that drive that keeps the film engaging and keeps the stakes high. JK Simmons is obviously phenomenal in what is probably one of my all time favourite performances, but Miles Teller also kills it in his role aswell. I've had the song Whiplash stuck in my head since this rewatch, but the actual score is also really great and sticks in the head well. The dialogue is probably the strongest element - every line hits so hard, from simple conversations to the larger concert scenes. It's just a brilliant film, and one that I can see myself revisiting time and time again in the future."
" Miles Teller
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,6,"Miles Teller, you kick ass! INtense!! Reminds me of earlier days in my life when I was on a sports team in school and what a nut I was and my coach."
" Movie like no other movie
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,9,"All actors do fantastic jobs but j.k simmons is just amazing i can't imagine anyone playing this charecter named fletcher by anyone else he gives this charecter so mutch depth emotion,flether is horibble person but you just can't stop watching him and loving him in the way.sinematography is beatiful you are going to see bloody drums by playing itmain charecter tryes his best but fletcher just destoys his ego entierly,main charecter is just getting rid off evverything in his life just to impress fletcher he trows his girlfriend mentality and his buddy there is one scene wher main charecter is rushing just to get drum notes and he gets into acident and main chatecter just bloody runs out to perform.fletcher justmain changed main charecter he made him as toxic as he is.to me this movie is about haw people change each another in a horrible way and haw trauma make syou strongrr person"
" It's always the World, and ur love.
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,10,"The motive of living (sometimes is from the others ),,,, the motive of loving.
If he left, still, not gonna touch the drum ever, at the moment, solved it"
" A poignant film that will stay relevant for a long time
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,10,"I had to write this review once I finished watching Whiplash. This film doesn't pull any punches with its messages and themes. This film shows that while it is okay to follow your passion and practising your craft, if you let it consume you, it will slowly shred away at your sanity. A definite recommend over here."
" Comedy, Fat Loss and many other benefits
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,9,"Guys, this movie is a masterpiece in comedy and fat loss. I lost 3 KGs while watching this.
It also served as a heater in cole winter night. my body is suddenly hot after watching this.
WOW"
" Watch it & Boost your adrenaline
",2021-02-11 00:00:00,9,"Seeking for perfection is good or bad ? I wonder if you have a great dream you should do your best to make it true even if you have someone pushing you beyond what is expected from you or just leave it to keep your emotional health. But if you leave it would you be satisfied with your life after abandoning your dreams? But this movie proves if you desperately need something just take it even if it's in the lion's den! Every actor mastered his role tightly, I felt Andrew's thirst for greatness and Fletcher's scrutiny to be satisfied. They made the last 15 minutes breathtaking."
" Obsession is a Sickness!
",2021-02-08 00:00:00,9,"Chazelle demonstrates the power influence has over the mind, how easily one can be brainwashed and manipulated by a mentor. Through clever development characters 'pop' out of the screen and become more real than even some of your closest friends.Through Andrew (Miles Teller) we learn when to quit, we learn that there are limits to the human condition and that not everything is as straightforward as it may seem. I would highly recommend this film."
" My new favorite movie...
",2021-02-08 00:00:00,10,"Whiplash.
Last night I watched this movie for my first time because I've heard many people mention that its great. I came in with high expectations, hoping that I would love it. And sure enough, I did. My jaw was dropped almost the whole movie and I didn't say a word for 10 minutes after I finished it. This is a perfect movie, and it's everything I ever wanted in a movie. I love the fire between Fletcher and Andrew, it's so blood-pumping. And I totally felt it when Andrew finally blew up on Fletcher. This movie is a 10/10."
" I could watch it a hundred times and never getting tired of it.
",2021-02-05 00:00:00,9,"Great soundtrack and great performances from JK Simmons and Miles Teller, that makes you empathize with Andrew and at the same time being difficult to hate on Fletcher. As I said, the music is awesome and makes you want to listen to it again and again.
This movie makes you think how far could you get to achieve perfection but also shows how toxic perfection can be sometimes"
" Hear me out it is important!
",2021-02-05 00:00:00,10,If you haven't seen this absolute masterpiece because you don't know about drumming you should check it out because i don't know about drumming too this movie isn't about drumming it uses drumming to send a message and sends it in a way you will never forget.
" Well edited
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,7,A different movie well edited movie.Greatveffor from all actors.
" Literally My Favorite Film
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,10,"This movie is amazing I recommend it if you like Jazz, comeback stories and more."
" Poor
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,3,"Can't fathom the hype. No suspense, no crescendo, no heart. Could have been a stunning film but there is simply not heart warming sense of someone overcoming hardship and hurdle. The protagonist is so overdone and silly, it gets irritating very quickly."
" Hell of a film
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,9,"Man..just finished watching this, never has a film made me so tense,stressed, angry, anxious, depressed..you name it..One thing's for sure, you get strong desire to quit everything your doing and just jump into something new and throw your soul into like never before, if someone says they've tried hard at something, show them this..haha...whole new meaning.An extremely emotionally raw film, which displays drive, obsession and commitment to extreme levels and shows the destructive abusive relationship which fuel it"
" powerful
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,10,This movie is one of my favorites. It's incredible and powerful. The acting was incredible and the story itself will make you stressed but a good stressed. The cinematography was incredible
" A forgotten masterpiece
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,10,"I recently re-watched this film and forgot about how gut wrenchingly moving this is. Though the movie is about a drummer who aspires to be the next ""great"", the direction of J.K. Simmons' character is just masterfully orchestrated by Damien Chazelle. I honestly think this film was snubbed in 2014 despite that year being stacked with fantastic films and 3 of my top 10 favorites from this decade released that year.If this movie was pushed by Hollywood and marketed as well as it was made, I have no doubt it would end up being a timeless film. It shows the gut wrenching grit of an ambitious man and realistically depicts the ups and downs on the road to success. It even leaves us with a surprising finale where we don't really know whether he would succeed or not.However, I advise anyone who has not already watched this film, to not expect anything. It is a great film, but I fear that the worst thing to do for a film that does not get enough attention is to blow it out of proportion. I simply ask anyone who is reading this to give the viewing this movie deserves and come out of it satisfied and inspired. It is not a happy film and every scene is full of impact.Happy Viewings."
" Sensational
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,10,"Whiplash is one of those films that reminds me why I love cinema (not that I particularly need a reminder!). It managed to turn the seemingly nondescript story of a music student at a competitive college into a breathless, gripping, edge of your seat experience.From the opening shot you can just tell this film is going to be something special. It delivered on pretty much every aspect you could want from a film.The performances were incredible. J.K. Simmons thoroughly deserved his Oscar for his stunning portrayal of the viscous taskmaster and conductor. I was on absolute tenterhooks watching him. The moments where the film fell quiet and we were waiting for his hand to drop and the orchestra to commence were filled with almost unbearable tension. His rage and his interactions with the students were so explosive and so great to watch. Simply superb.Miles Teller was equally fantastic. Such a physical performance which allowed us to go on this emotional and painstaking journey with him. He made his character very relatable despite his flaws. On top of this his interactions with J.K. Simmons were brilliant. You never knew which way they were going to go and this unpredictability really raised the film to another level.As well as this, the film had such a brilliant style and tone. The direction was spot on, with the camera work adding to the frantic and desperate feeling of Miles' character. The pacing was also perfect, with the film coming in at a nice and crisp one hour forty five.Phenomenal."
" A mircale.
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,9,"What are the boundries? Can those be defined or the word itself is deceitful? Or it actually stands for Horizon which is just the opposite of it. Needless to say it's one of the most paradixical word I ever heard.
The level of effort and the outlook changes it to be the polls apart.
Here comes this movie, the effort and the perseverance that this drummer puts, changes the word forever. Can change those tough knots which we sometimes find hard to undo. Boundries are made to be pushed, pushed to the infinity.
This one can definitely make you believe this. And anything like this is miracle and miracles are not worth missing.
A must watch. #Whiplash2014."
" Seat-of-the-pants emotional roller coaster
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,10,"The most hideously abusive teacher I have ever seen - a walking catastrophe to be neither tolerated nor emulated. I'd have fired him the first day he laid a hand on a student. The Buddy Rich's and Bird's of this world were internally driven. They would have made it with or without a teacher, tyrant or mentor. But that said, this instructor's litany of abuse does put one in mind of Rich himself as the world's most abusive bandmaster.This film is a first rate exposé of pedagogical wrongdoing, one that harks back to an old-fashioned and obsolete mantra that ""you have to be cruel to be kind.""No you don't.If there is one flaw in this movie, it is the redemptive ending for Fletcher. But I still rate this !0/10"
" You probably need to like jazz.
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,5,I sat all the way through this as I like to finish films in case I'm judging the start harshly and missing a classic. After 40 minutes I started looking up reviews which is never a good sign but as they were so positive I was expecting the film to really pick up the pace. Unfortunately it was more of the same with characters I couldn't relate to or have empathy for. I love music films but this did nothing for me personally.
" watch it watch it watch it
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,10,"This movie gave me chills. i froze everytime jksimmons entered in scene, i think no one would have done a better job as terence than Simmons. his character is so well done i could actually feel his presence behind me. this movie potraits the passion and obsession for success (and music)perfectly. andrew had to give up a lot of things to stay in the group and he didnt mind doing it, he kept hours practicing to the point where he got his hands hurt and more, way more, the car accident, he kept going, the trap from terence, he kept going etc.., i cant express how you can feel EVERY EMOTION through this movie, its an actual masterpiece, miles is a great actor, and also did his role perfectly, he was actually obsessed. i feel like this review is not even close to convince someone to watch it, because im not able to express how you feel throughout this movie though a text, just watch it! its genius."
" One of the best movies I've ever seen.
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,10,"Just watch it. You don't have to know anything about jazz or drumming. If you enjoy superb acting in a well written movie this is the one to watch. Amazing performance by the young lead and his mentor, with Paul Reizer giving a great performance as the father. I can't recommend this movie highly enough."

",2021-01-13 00:00:00,9,"Overall, Whiplash is a fantastic story regarding the ambition people have for the dream passions. The performances from Miles Teller and J. K. Simmons encapsulate this premise superbly, they are terrific. Damien Chazelle has fast become one of my favourite directors not just today but ever. La La Land was the film that made me fall in love with movies, but wow Whiplash is absolutely extraordinary! There was simply nothing to dislike about this, it's rightfully on IMDB's Top 250 ever and it's one I'd instantly recommend, go treat yourself!Quote - ""I was there to push people beyond what's expected of them. I believe that's an absolute necessity."" - FletcherRating - 5/5"
" An extraordinary movie
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,10,"Amazing film about drive. Even if the premise of playing in a jazz band might not be relatable, the real subject matter of the movie is. See this film isn't just about jazz drumming. It's about the pursuit of one's dream turning into an obsession. Blood, sweat and tears. Those three body fluids essentially represent this entire masterclass of cinematography. The fact of the matter is that we can all relate to having a strict teacher. Some of us can even relate to having an abusive mentor. At the end of the day, this movie speaks to everyone on some level. An absolute must-watch masterpiece."
" My heart is STILL racing
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,10,"You ever just see something that makes you super ambitious AND wanna quit everything at the same time?that's whiplash.--This film dude. It's easily the most engaging I've ever been watching anything. Only a couple of other films come even close and even then - it's still no contest.Whiplash perfectly encapsulates what it feels like to try to get great at something. The ambition, the drive, the self-hatred, the gratification. It's all a part of the process. Is that process a good thing though? Many masters of their crafts got there after a life full of abuse and turmoil. Is that necessary for anybody to get great? Sure, Charlie Parker got hit in the head with a cymbal - would he have still been great had that not happened?These are the questions Whiplash asks.Fletcher is an abusive teacher. Andrew is an ambitious young player. Their relationship is awful and the movie doesn't try to hide that. In fact, it shows blatantly, multiple times, that Fletcher's affect on Andrew is a negative one. And yet... at the end of the film, after both parties have cursed each other out, we see Fletcher look approvingly on Andrew and Andrew looks happy.Is it a happy ending? Will Andrew become the next Charlie Parker?I don't know.He might go on to be one of the best drummers alive. He also might go on to die at a young age because of alcohol, drugs, or suicide. Again, this film doesn't hide the effects of abuse. It shows how closely talent and ambition can turn into an obsession. Fletcher is not a good guy. Andrew absolutely needs some therapy. It's insane.With all of that said, I have a background in music. I'm currently pursuing a career as a creator on the internet. Some days, I wish I had a Fletcher to tell me to get things done. Other days, I wish I had somebody to tell me ""good job."" Being a creator is probably one of the most difficult career paths anyone can choose, simply because you always have room to grow and your best never feels like enough.Fortunately though, my take is that ""the greats"" weren't successful 'because' of bad events - they became successful 'DESPITE' the bad events.If Fletcher's method worked, he'd have a lot of Charlie Parkers on his hand. He didn't though. He was a awful teacher and honestly, the dude deserves to lose his job for good.ANYWAYS, Whiplash is goated. Damien Chazelle is a madlad. That final act is the most exhilarated I've ever been watching a movie that's not Avengers: Infinity War. J.K. Simmons has some of the funniest dialogue I've ever heard. Miles Teller truly looked like he was in pain playing the drums - he should definitely be in more great movies. Since I've rewatched this now, I can easily say it's one of my favorite movies of all time."
" Never seen a meaner character...
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,9,"Whiplash was a great movie, it had an amazing story that takes its time but never felt like a moment was not used. Fletcher was the high point of this film for me with an outstanding act of such an intimidating character. This is a must watch if you like playing music but even if you don't I still highly recommend it."
" Splendid!
",2021-01-07 00:00:00,9,"The acting was great. You both hate and understand fletcher, you both love and hate Andrew because of the way she treated Nicole. Fletcher wants Andrew to join his band when he heard him practice by himself. He was being really tough on him and his place is not secure at all in the band as he constantly switches between the drummers. It get really harsh when his fingers bled during the practice and she put a glass of water with ice to relieve his pain. The dinner at his family home was really great as most of the people don't appreciate musicians and their achievements while they praise subpar sportsmen and others. I loved how he talked back to the others by the table. The fact that his father and he goes to the cinemas regularly was really nice. He asked the girl working at the cinemas out and they dated but he behaved really rude to her saying he want to be great and don't want anyone in his life. Fletcher wanted them to come to a concert in a different town. He was on the way and the bus had a flat. He rented a car and barely got there on time. He forgot his drumsticks in the car and after he argued with fletcher he rushed out to fetch them and got an accident with a truck. Covered in blood he returned to the studio to play and but he failed. He then had a mental breakdown and assaulted fletch. He got dismissed from the school. Someone asked him to testify about fletcher being abusive because a student committed suicide and his parents thought its because of fletcher. (He actually made the band listen to his record in the class and cried and said he died at an accident) then he saw him play at a restaurant. When fletcher saw him he wanted to talk and he explained why he was so hard on them and I somehow thought he's right. He then invited to play at a festival for him in his new band and he came back but it was a trap because he knew he's the one who talked about him to the people in charge.(he invited Nicole on the phone but she said she had to ask to her boyfriend) Then he wanted them to play different song that Andrew don't know of. Andrew failed miserably and left the scene but returned and started his solo show on the scene. I laughed when he looked at fletcher and said f. You to him. He then had to get along with him and he was even glad at the end. I felt euphoric and it was one of the most tense movies I've ever seen."
" Never stop chasing your dream!
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,10,"When you have think you have worked hard at something watch this and think again! Whiplash shows you that to get to the top you really have to shed blood, sweat and tears. This is a film was brilliant!"
" A must see!
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,10,Excellent movie ! JK Simmons surpasses the expectations by the greatness of his acting! The precise psychological work done on the characters is at such high level that the viewer is plunged into the roles and lives it through the scenes of this toxic yet challenging relationship between the teacher and the student so divinely played by Teller. Extreme moments A real chef d'oeuvre !
" Rising Tempo A real Score!
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,9,"A beautifully crafted film despite it's visual limitations (mostly inside studio) it delivers symbolic musical images combined with explosive drama raising the question how far should, or can student be pushed to achieve their potential. The film sets the mood from the get go like the a drum roll the doesn't let go until the very last cut. The cast all deliver a great crescendo along with the direction and editing. The music (jazz) speaks for itself. In my opinion a must see movie for lovers of any musical taste."
" Absolute flawless masterpiece!!finally right person wins oscar!!!!
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,10,"They rarely get it right at the Oscar's or even nominate the right actors and actresses but they nailed it here. J.k. Simmons killed it his performance was flawless and right up there with all the greats, doc holiday, scarface, the butcher, hannibal, gladiator, etc. You'll remember fletchers name after seeing this phenomenal film. Loved everything about it so glad I purchased the bluray I've already watched it several times and it's like watching a master at work everytime mr Simmons is on screen."
" Whiplash gave me whiplash
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,10,"I'm not a fan of jazz. I'm not a fan of Miles teller. I was aware this movie had gotten numerous accolades, but I'd kept putting it off because I was expecting some kind dramatic character study with a lot of jazz thrown in. Man was I so wrong.The summary is fairly straight forward Miles Teller is a drummer attending university in the hopes of someday reaching the fame of famous Jazz musicians like Charles Parker. While practicing late one night he's observed by J.K. Simmons' Fletcher a renowned Jazz composer looking for players that could fill out the sound his orchestral band needs to win a coming US competition meant to be the height of success. After accepting an invitation It becomes immediately clear that Fletcher is an awful, terrifying taskmaster who's mental games consistently crushes members souls while also making it clear if they give up their hopes of ever reaching success are over. While at first intimidated Miles Teller's Neiman becomes obsessed with winning the mental battle with Fletcher. This battle reaches insane, near unparalleled heights, in cinematic history. This is not a drama, this is an action thriller. I mean that literally.This movie was so intense I was gripping the edge of my seat until the credits. In a way I would sort of compare this to full metal jacket. Specifically the basic training in the first act that leads to the terrifying conclusion, but the largest difference being that unlike Pvt. Pyle, Miles Teller's Neiman has a drive and intensity to succeed far beyond what is acceptably human. It also kind of reminded me of The Usual Suspects in that there's twists in this movie you can't possibly see coming. I think I audibly gasped three separate times. I left this film with the kind of exultation and exhaustion I didn't think you could feel watching a movie. I would recommend this to anybody excepting those with heart conditions."
" Outstanding
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,10,Incredible and powerful film. Outstanding. Only a moron wouldn't like it
" Entertaining but NOT the way to learn Jazz...
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,7,"After watching this movie, I contacted two people and asked them for their opinions on Whiplash. One of them is my Jazz teacher who's been playing longer than I've been alive, and the other was an experienced drummer who's played with him. Here are the two opinions:ME: The drumming was impressive and the teacher evokes an emotional reaction out of you, similar to fright but instead it's more-so like second hand embarrassment. The bloody hands were off-putting, but the ending was sort of satisfying because it leads you to believe that this drummer will become ""one of the greats.""As for the 2 other people: They both felt that this was NOT the correct way to learn Jazz. In the eyes of yourself, what's more important: the journey or the destination? I'll leave it at that."
" If jazz sounds like noise to you, avoid this film.
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,4,"The synopsis of the film mentions jazz band but I must emphasise how jazz heavy and drum heavy the movie is. The performances were solid and story centers around a young man's obsession with playing the drums, with a very angry, potty-mouthed conductor at the helm of a high school band... but it's still jazz. It's like white noise to me so that detracts from acting and becomes purgatory."
" Awesome
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,9,"Believe me
If you want a movie that can give you motivation and meanwhile entertain you watch this
Incredible storyline and magnificent actors are really a good combination"
" Yes, excellent but...
",2020-12-25 00:00:00,8,"This movie could give us a dangerous idea of the ""cost of greatness"", and I have trouble with it. As a psychologist, and like everyone I suppose, it's obvious how dangerous these kinds of obsessions can be: anxiety, stress, depression, severe mental disorders in general that can conduct to cardiac arrests, illnesses, deadly diseases, and suicides, to all that it joins a flood of collateral damage with third parties (relatives, friends, couples, children, etc.)
After everything Fletcher did to Andrew throughout the entire film, Whiplash ends giving us the idea that perfection (obsessions) can be reached by human beings, which is stupid because this only exists as an ideal. It makes us believe that through ""hard work"" and immeasurable demands, a musician can become ""successful"". Maybe with these ideas the film could also give us some kind of justification for Fletcher's behavior with his students.Whiplash is an excellent movie: cinematography, acting, music, and many other things were magnificent. But I like to think that this film wasn't created just to try to inspire people to highlight in an, increasingly, competitive and individualistic world.
Instead, I want to believe that it was made to warn people of how dangerous can be this ""way to success"", the cost of it, and its several consequences. To incentivize mental (and physical) health care above anything else must be a priority for everyone."
" Deserving of its oscars and more!
",2020-12-23 00:00:00,9,"I wish I watched Whiplash sooner. The acting, especially by J.K.Simmons, is incredible and really brings the movie together. The camerawork is great, this is what movies should look and feel like, the unique angles and lighting look attractive and make the movie more enjoyable without even noticing. The writing is good, not great but is suitable for this movie, everything slots perfectly into place and flows very nicely with plenty of twists. My only negative about this is the ending, it wasn't a bad ending at all I just wish I got to see more of it, I wanted to see what happened...but it does make it different from other movies that would continue and feel very cliché. 9/10 great movie, you don't even have to like jazz music to enjoy this movie!"
" Some movie!
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,9,"I was surprised at how much I actually liked this movie and how much I'd feel for the characters. At first, I expected it to be a lot like Boyhood or Hell or High Water, in which it would be a good movie, but I'd feel very little, but it isn't. Kudos to Damien Chazelle."
" Exciting. A film for dreamers.
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,9,"A very deep, hard and emotional film. A film for young artists who want to dream, with a lot of determination. A film that introduces you to the numerous obstacles and difficulties. Awesome.Crazy cast, great soundtrack, beautiful direction, but the real power of this film is the editing. PERFECT."
" A modern day masterpiece
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,10,"Damien Chazelle has proven himself to be one of the best directors right now. La La Land is one of the best musicals made but I discovered him through Whiplash which I consider to be a modern day masterpiece.Whiplash follows Andrew Neiman, a young drummer who enrolls in a class at a music conservatory led by the frightening and abusive Fletcher who stops at nothing to make sure his students are the best they can be.I remember how amazed I was after watching this film the first time and after multiple viewings Whiplash became one of my favourite films of all time. It's such a simple story but at the same time there are many layers to it. After each watch I discovered details I had missed that brought so much development to the characters whether it was something shown through the visuals or subtlety in some dialogues, it shows how great of a storyteller Damien Chazelle is.I didn't think much of Miles Teller before I saw this film but he shows how great of an actor he. I really felt the passion and drive he had to become one of the greatest drummers and the emotional range he gives Neiman is brilliant. However, the main attraction is J.K. Simmons in his best performance to date. I didn't believe for one second I was watching J.K. Simmons play Fletcher. He fully transformed himself into Fletcher and conveyed the angry, abusive and unforgiving nature of Fletcher perfectly allowing each scene to be as intense as possible. He fully deserves the Oscar for this movie. Chazelle's script is excellent. It's bursting with fiery dialogues and creative insults that J.K. Simmons elevates with his striking performance whilst also fleshing these characters out and helping us get inside their mind and understand what they're going through and why they're doing what they're doing.With a runtime of 1 hour 40 minutes, Whiplash wastes no time. The intensity is consistent throughout leaving us with barely any room to breathe and that's also thanks to the crisp editing by Tom Cross. Chazelle directs each scene with utmost confidence and ends the film with one of the most tense and entertaining finales to ever exist.Everything about Whiplash is incredible. The captivating story, the marvellous acting, the immaculate editing and confident directing all combine to make one of the greatest films of the 21st Century."
" Great movie
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,8,The film is good and you can't tell how much time has passed by watching it. He played the lead roles. The movie was fun and I watched the movie go into it
" It really is a masterpiece, it shook me
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,10,"I went in to this movie thinking i was going to hate it, that it would only fit a certain crowd and that it would make a political statement against tough teaching. I was wrong. It does not make a statement for or against it, and is not neutral either. It is just there.Whiplash have the characteristic of all masterpieces, it is completely unique which makes it difficult to describe it. It has a life of its own.The only characteristic i can express to you is intensity. It is so intense that you can not look away, your pulse goes up and the intensity is only escalating the further you get. There is no rest, only escalating intensity. Thus it does not follow the typical structure of film, the closest film i can compare its structure and intensity to is Apocalypto. And the ending, oh god, it is so unconventional, it left me speechless.This is art, thank you for the experience."
" Not quite my tempo
",2020-12-16 00:00:00,8,"A great movie with a simple plot and high in potential of hitting you off.The story is set in a Music School where our protagonist (Miles Teller) is trying his best to make his dream of being a perfect jazz drummer come true. On the other side of the story, there is a music instructor who out of nowhere, meets Andrew practicing some techniques. The story doesn't end here as due to the perfectionism of the teacher, things become tough for Andrew, to the point he is ready to bleed and lose everything for his great ambition. Containing some cliches like if you practice hard, you will achieve everything and blah blah, the script is mind blowing that it's capable of engaging its viewers for almost two hours.I don't have any bright opinion about the cast except for J.K. Simmons. His performance is nothing but absolute perfection. Not for one second can you think of him being an actor. He offers a memorable portrait of a perfectionist teacher, who is ready to sacrifice everything to find the next talented drummer of his time and the performance of him was indeed gripping and adorable.Now to get to the technical aspects of Whiplash, everything is well crafted and executed. The cinematography is all well set and the music is ""right at the tempo"".Now you might wonder why I have given an eight to this movie. Well, to be honest, I was of a high expectation of this picture as I had already heard a lot about it but at the end of the movie, beside the solid performance of J.K. Simmons and a top notch narrative, including the story of music artists, it didn't live up to my expectation and somehow made me not to think of it as sharp and witty as I wanted. Nevertheless, overall it's a marvelous movie to watch and thoroughly recommended to be watched at least ONCE."
" I watched this Movie back to back!!
",2020-12-15 00:00:00,10,"... and yes that's how good this Movie is...
I probably watched it More then 7 or 8 times, and it's always a blast to watch the end..."
" ""Not my tempo...""
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,9,"They don't come any closer to a perfect film than this one. Within the first 2 minutes you'll be totally hooked... and then just feel the tension slowly slowly rise. JK Simmons is unbelievable.Film film making, perfect acting..... just perfect."
" Wow!
",2020-12-08 00:00:00,10,This is a rare film that keeps you on edge for a literal 90% of screen time. The suspense is maddening and the characters phenomenal. I can't remember the last movie I saw that had my heart pounding like this. I'm honestly not even that much of a jazz fan. I can't even begin to imagine how this hits in the heart of an actual musician. If you like edgy stuff with a lightening fast tempo then check this out. It's an amazing experience from start to finish. Teller and Simmons deserve all the roses.
" It's ok
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,6,J.K Simmons is a good actor he was good in the film I think this is made specifically for musicians as not a lot happened except some intense drumming and psychotic shouting.
" Don't give up your dreams!
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,8,"""Whiplash"" is a 2014 American drama movie. It depicts a story between an ambitious drummer and a professional but cruel teacher. The movie gives me a feeling of depression, but it also shows me that being successful is not easy at all. So, I would like to make some comments on this movie.Firstly, I want to talk about Andrew, the main character of the movie. He is very endurable and persistent. For gaining the core spot, he does a five-hour session with his two opponents. He even makes his hands bleed incessantly. I do not think this is something that a normal person can cope with. Besides, although his bandleader and conductor, Fletcher, always scolds him with dirty words, humiliates him and sometimes even slaps him violently in his face. He does not give up. He keeps practicing until his hands are bleeding and shaking, then he will put his hands in the cold water and continues playing. As the result, he gets the chance to be the core spot of the drummers in the band. So, persistence and resilience are really important for one to succeed.Additionally, Andrew is also a very enthusiastic drum player. He can play drums for several hours without having rests and sometimes when his hands bleeds he even feels no pain. However, due to Fletcher's scorn, this enthusiasm becomes an obsession for Andrew, he intends to oppose Fletcher through being the top drummer. Hence, he break up with his girlfriend, continue attending the competition after a car accident and play extended solo in front of professional judges. He has been crazy about playing drums and nothing can disrupt him or stop him. Lastly, Fletcher is eventually impressed by Andrew's performance and accepts him. But Andrew has lost his pure enthusiasm and his kindness. His purpose is not playing drummer anymore.On the other side, I also want to discuss about Fletcher. He is a fickle person. He could be very mean and ruthless to Andrew during the rehearsal and suddenly care about him a lot during the break. Moreover, he is also very obsessed and even sensitive with music. He can hear every wrong note and clearly know which person makes the mistake. From the last scene, when Fletcher sees Andrew playing his solo perfectly, his expression also shows that he is satisfied with it. Therefore, I think he is someone who has an excessively high standard of music.Consequently, in my opinion, ""Whiplash"" is a very educational movie. It shows that having success is very tough and taxing, it costs people a lot of energy and time. At the same time, it also advocates people to have a dream as it tells people that no matter how difficult the circumstance is, achieving dreams is still possible. But I think some parts of the film are actually dramatic, like playing drums after a car accident, this is not real and a little bit exaggerated. So, overall, this movie is quite impressive to me and makes me think about the reasons why I chase my dream."
" Suave, spirited and intense. Just like Jazz.
",2020-11-28 00:00:00,9,"The Good:
Excellent performances, especially by Simmons.
Awe inspiring depiction of a roughshod taskmaster and an impuissant protege.
Palpably precise editing.
Mellisonant soundtrack making one fall in love with jazz even if one weren't a fan.
Deft dodging of melodramatic overtones that's a staple of movies surrounding the theme of music.
Curt handling of the romantic angle.The Not-so-great:
A little vacuum left by a lack of a backstory and Simmons's character buildup.Overall:
Watch it for J.K. Simmons's mastery.
Hear it to appreciate the true American musical genre.

" The most intense movie experience
",2020-11-25 00:00:00,10,"It had been far too long since I last saw this film. Whiplash was what I considered to be my favourite movie of all time for a long time. However, recently I have been watching a lot of films, and my taste has somewhat changed. As such, I wasn't sure if this movie would still be at the top of my list.Having finished this movie nearly out of breath, I think that it is safe to say that Whiplash retains its position as my favourite movie of all time. I have always liked movies with high tension and intensity, and quite frankly, I don't think that there is another movie that captures those two feelings so well. This film is easily the most intense movie experience that I have ever had. The intensity of the characters keeps you engaged and on edge the whole time. The intensity of practising and performing makes you out of breath even though you are only watching. And the intensity of trying to achieve perfection makes you wonder how far you'd be willing to go yourself.In many ways, one of the most pivotal moments in the movie is the jazz cafe scene. It allows you to breathe for a moment, but, even more importantly, it allows the movie to take a deep breath before unleashing a finale that makes the rest of the movie feel cute. That moment in the cafe is crucial, as it allows you to reflect on what you have seen and to pause for a moment. That final scene becomes as impactful as it is because you have been allowed to understand the complexity of the two main characters. The cafe scene could be the best in the film if it weren't for the fact there are so many other even more impactful scenes.Although I rarely discuss things like performances, I think that with this one it's mandatory. I am, of course, talking about the performance of J. K. Simmons. If this movie isn't intense enough on its own, leave it to Simmons to give an unbelievable performance and turn it up a notch. A performance that is scary and intense, but also emotional and sad. The moments where his character lets his guard down, are just as good as the moments where he yells some of the most creative insults that I have ever heard at the top of his lungs.Ultimately, the brilliance of this movie comes down to the fact that I have never seen another film that captures tension and intensity as well as this one. I have never seen another film that makes me feel the way that this one does. And when you find a film like that, it's not surprising that it becomes your favourite one. And for me, that film is Whiplash."

" a interesting film
",2020-11-21 00:00:00,6,Fletcher seems like a cruel ruler of music. Neimin is like the citizen failing to follow the rules. music is one of my greatest ways of entertainment. i like stories about people failing to be successful. i always wanted to make a movie about failure. that's what i like about movies.

" Saw at Theatre First Day it Came to San Diego
",2020-11-18 00:00:00,9,"I saw a pretty intense movie today called ""Whiplash"". It tells the story of a Young Music student enrolled at a Music Conservatory where the instructor is (excuse my French) a *&@#* F*&^%. Kind of like Hell Week in a Fraternity or Boot Camp in the Service, except the kid plays the Drums in a Jazz Ensemble.
The film stars JK Simmons, you know him from the Farmers Insurance commercials, with a non comedic role for Paul Reiser from ""Mad About You"" fame. Miles Teller plays the drummer with an intensity hard to describe, you just gotta hear it. R for Language from 2014"
" A MASTERPIECE!!! Might be the greatest movies of all time
",2020-11-17 00:00:00,10,"This movie is an intense drama about an obsessed artist and it is done masterfully by Damien Chazelle who i think in his next two movies could prove to be the best director in the world i think he is special and he proves it in this movie and lala land this is an incredible movie with a well crafted story and an incredible performance by JK Simmons you see what the drummer is willing to go threw and put himself threw to achieve his goals and the ending is one of the greatest ending of all time, Damien knows how to end a movie."
" Moved to tears and beyond
",2020-11-12 00:00:00,10,"I really don't know what to say that can justify how great this movie is. Just watch it, it will make you furious and ecstatic. Even more if you're a serious music lover."
" Fabulous Ending
",2020-11-11 00:00:00,10,"The final 15 to 20 minutes of this film left me jaw open the entire time. I was blow away. The twist, and the brilliant performances! Come on! It almost brought me to tears. Immediately after finishing the movie, I ran out to tell my closest friends and family members how enjoyable it was, which I something I don't do too often."
" Never give up or be stubborn?
",2020-11-10 00:00:00,9,"A simple film tells of a drummer at one of the leading music schools. A young man who is still in the junior bench who is looking for his talent by a respected perfectionist conductor. This is where the story of the drama begins.A conductor who is known to be a perfectionist and wants everything to be right, one of which is the drummer. He actually wanted the young man to give his best in playing drums. Seeing the potential that exists in the young man.The pressure was so heavy by the conductor that it forced the players to bounce. Like a double edged knife, if it can take its meaning it will end well, if not it will not be good. We sometimes know that humans need pressure to unleash their potential. When humans are depressed, usually the true abilities will come out by themselves.Back to this story. The young man initially felt pressured by the guidance of a conductor. Until finally he forced his situation, until he bled even though he still practiced. Until he got into an accident, he still insisted on joining the competition. He still wants to play. The goal is he doesn't want to lose the competition. He wants to strive to be the best. Until finally he became the best. Can finish a song stunningly in the end.A quite interesting simple story about Determination, Never Giving Up, Stubbornness, being one. If you start giving up on something, watch this movie."

" The plot is great, but I expected more from the end
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,8,"The movie story catches you as Andrew works so hard to accomplish his goals. But, eventually, it becomes an obsession and starts to consume all the aspects of his life.
That's when the movie starts to become so ugly. I don't know whether the film wants to criticize or glamorize Andrew's behavior (I have a mixed feeling on that).
Maybe be the idea of seeing someone wearing out your personal life (family, friends) on behalf of the career ruined the film for me.
It is the portrait of an anxious person who wants to be on the top as fast as possible without enjoying the learning process. Or, maybe it is just a 21-century portrait. It is sad."

" Total Fanciful Rubbish
",2020-10-22 00:00:00,1,"As a professional musician of 40 years who has worked in many facets of the industry including as an educator for primary, secondary and tertiary students I found this movie an absolute abomination, which could not be further from the truth! I have never in my lifetime encountered, or even heard of someone who would treat their students in such a way as portrayed in this film.
In the real world someone who would conduct themselves in such a manner would have been arrested and charged for emotional and physical abuse. In the real world of musical education students are certainly encouraged to find their full potential but with all the care, love and concern for both the student and their craft. Certainly not as portrayed by the heartless character in this film.
For this film to be nominated for so many awards is also a joke, and is indicative of the pulp fiction that Hollywood is only capable of producing."
" AMAZING!

" Of becoming a legend
",2020-10-11 00:00:00,9,"I seldom do write reviews. But now I had to. I've just watched the movie for the fourth time and in all these years (and even before) not one movie has caught me in one thing like this movie does: you truly witness the birth of a legend.
The movie deals about a young man chasing his dream to ""get one of the best jazz-drummers on this planet!"". And by the end of the movie you witness this exact moment! The intensity, thrill and overwhelmning effect of the characters is shown in a way, I've never seen in a movie before! The viewer gets transferred to their feelings and gets drawn into the spell.
Would recommend this movie for everyone, not just music interested people."
" 11/10

I've watched it many times over the years and there's no aspect in it that isn't just exquisite. Whiplash should be IMDb ranked average over 9,5 If you ask me. Watch this movie with great audio/speakers, it really captures your emotions. Immaculate piece of cinematography. Thank you."
" Wow. Just, wow!
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,8,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but was greatly surprised. A boy wanting to be great and the lengths he will embark on to become great are heart gripping. The movie was full of tension that left me with my heart pounding most of the time. Hearing the instrumental music brought me back to my old band days, the music was beautiful to listen to. The acting, screenplay, filming and lines were a true performance that strikes home in delivering the message this movie portrays.Whiplash is based on a true story, but it is for a certain kind of audience. There may not be any explosions, or in-depth romance or heart warming moments that leave you with a good feeling. But it does bring out a powerful message that to be great, you need to push yourself beyond what you think is possible."
" Remake of ""An Officer and a Gentleman""...
",2020-10-09 00:00:00,3,"Really, that's all this is. With jazz. J. K. Simmons is great, as usual. There is no reason for this film to exist.Love of music should not be about shouting and belittling a musician. I was in a band as a teenager, and I loved our conductor. We played as good as we could to please him. I would have been one of those who quit a program where you were humiliated and abused, with the idea it would make you a better musician. I suppose there are people out there who would benefit from a teaching experience like the one shown in this film, and they would stick with it. It's just too cruel of a film."
" The Film that Made me a Cinephile
",2020-10-08 00:00:00,10,"I remember watching this for the first time back in 2014 and admiring what an absolute masterpiece it was. Amazing directing, writing, editing, and acting. All of the music in this movie is wonderful and will stay in your head for years. Love how Andrew starts off so innocent and reserved but slowly descends into arrogance and narcissism. Fletcher is the most thought-provoking character in the film and one of the best written antagonists ever. I've noticed how the best villains are always presented as the most evil wretches before they explain themselves and almost make you agree with them (this was also done well by Marvel with Thanos). Seen plenty of movies, but none of them have ever reached the heights of this.Greatest film of all time. 10/10"
" Movie of the year.
",2020-10-05 00:00:00,10,I cried hysterically after seeing this masterpiece. This movie is NOT only about music. And still - it is all about music.

" Shockingly Real
",2020-10-03 00:00:00,10,"It's easy to label this film as exceedingly ""unrealistic"" when you've never known someone like Fletcher. Truth be told, his unsettling degree of extremism is unequivocally real.At the end of the day, this remains one of the greatest films ever made. Period."

" Whiplash!
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,10,"I feel like Chazelle should take this film and teach a class. Whiplash is a perfectly crafted masterpiece. It's trim and lean at 107 minutes and not one of them is wasted. The tension is artfully done, it grabs hold and never lets go from start to finish.JK Simmons is remarkable, balancing this complex character with incredible skill. It really is exceptional how he manages to be so utterly reprehensible Andy then likable and back again. Teller's calm, muted performance balances perfectly against it.This really is a movie that grabs you and doesn't let go. There are so many points where the tension is so strong that it takes your breath away. This really is a perfect movie, not a shot wasted, not one misstep. An absolute recommend to anyone that hasn't seen it."
" WONDERFUL
",2020-09-28 00:00:00,10,"An excellent musical and dramatic experience, with great performances and iconic moments. TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!"
" Very unrealistic.
",2020-09-27 00:00:00,3,"Do not get me wrong, I watched the movie till the very end because was intrigued what will happen next till the very end. The thing is despite the good acting the movie is a pure kind of ""overly dramatized to feed the thirst of the audience taste"" fiction that made the majority of viewers take it for serious.
The way the story being, leaves an absolutely wrong impression on the world of making music and the musicians at all, depicting them as a kind of ambitious, ruthless professionals whose brutality knows no limits thus making an offence to the ones dedicated their whole life to the art. Just give me a big, fat brake, people."
" Dark. A lot to think about.
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,8,"At first I thought this movie was too dark and advocated bullying wins, but there is much more depth to this story with reflection. Watch the actions of the father.The acting is fantastic."
" The Best And Most Inspiring Music Film
",2020-09-22 00:00:00,10,"This movie has great tension with great camera work and story telling. The acting is so good, there isn't much to be said without spoilers, but it is a must see for anyone."
" Wow!
",2020-09-17 00:00:00,10,"I just finished watching Whiplash about 15 minutes ago and all I can say is wow! I'm still buzzing from watching it, it's intense, I feel like a different person than I was earlier this evening for having finally watched it. I was expecting a really good movie from its rating on here but I was still surprised by just how good it wasI can't speak to its technical details but it all works so well in telling the story, I felt like I was right there with the characters and taken along on one hell of a journey. I'm not a big fan of jazz music but you don't have to be to get swept away by the story and the obvious passion that went into making this movie. The acting and obviously the music were great.What I don't understand is how I never heard of it before I stumbled across it on. I was intrigued by it having a higher rating than many of my most loved movies. I can only assume I didn't hear about it because I don't watch awards shows, I haven't checked but surely it must've won a bunch of awards. It certainly deserved them.Watch it on the biggest screen with the best sound system you can, you won't regret it."
" Great !!

" Thoughts on Whiplash
",2020-09-11 00:00:00,9,"An incredible story of ambition and perseverance. Outstanding performances from both main characters but especially J.K Simmons as Fletcher. It's a brutal student/mentor relationship guided by Fletcher's ruthless philosophy which I completely agree with but would never want to participate in. Every scene is gripping and captivating. I'm not going to say too much, just watch it.9.5/10"

",2020-09-09 00:00:00,10,"Not gonna write a long review cuz this movie can speak for itself. This is a flawless movie with an unbelivable performance from jk simmons. The music is great, and it has a message that speaks to me about how it requires pain to make a dream come true."
" The most stressful movie I have ever seen
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,8,The entire movie was incredibly tense. I found myself unable to relax. It felt like a bad dream that won't end. I can't think of another movie that made me feel this way. Highly recommend!
" Abusive a-holes win
",2020-09-08 00:00:00,2,"Finally watched this movie, and it is one of the worst I've seen in years. Great acting, but seriously flawed message. The message is that if you are a horribly abusive a-hole, you will win in the end. Abusive a-holes create great musicians. That is the message. While I will agree that many abusive people are never held accountable, I can say from experience as a psychologist that children and adults who are emotionally abused do not win!"
" Its awesome ! You will need it.
",2020-09-04 00:00:00,8,Whiplash is an amazing movie that shows the working toward your passion . It shows passion is much greater than any job. The movie story shows how a mentor guides or basically states his ways his style to help improve a person .
" Perfection.
",2020-09-04 00:00:00,10,"Chazelle, Teller, and Simmons made a perfect film. This film is the embodiment of tension, of suspense, of anxiety, of gratification. Everything, it hits every single ball out of the park. Chazelle's directing is flawless, and the color is absolutely perfect. I found myself pausing this movie very often to just look at the shots and colors that Chazelle had composed on the screen. Teller acts the HELL out of this role, and he does it perfectly. Simmons acts the HELL out of this role, and he does it perfectly. I may not have said perfect enough, but as a longtime band member and avid film lover, this film is perfect."
" Out of mind film

",2020-08-27 00:00:00,10,"The story, the ups and downs, it's all good. The rhythm of the screen switch, the close-up in the clean background and the interpretation of the characters by the actors are all very expressive. There is no progressive foreshadowing, but the direct links can experience the complex connotation. It captures the emotional impact and weakens the film's technique.Have not given up in the lucky, want to take a breath, but in fact the reality is always more than the so-called warmth cruel.Once the pursuit of the best and beyond the limits of the goal, unless achieved, or that breath, a lifetime can not be swallowed.""Don't worry about what other people think. You're here for a reason.""""Because I want to be better. I want to be one of the greatest.""""You're back to the core.""""I'm there to push them beyond their limits.""""Only one goal in mind.""""There are no two words more harmful than good.""""And I'll never apologize for trying.""

" More than a musical movie
",2020-08-25 00:00:00,10,"If you are thinking Whiplash is any other music related movie then I think you are wrong.
Whiplash is more than just a musical movie,it is a movie about pushing limits.
it is about how far you can go to become something great, and don't get me started on how intense this movie gets, it literally gave me chills in most scenesJ.k. Simmons nailed his character as a teacher, you know how sometimes you get the feeling about your school days and all the cruel things you teacher said to you when you did something wrong and how for a moment you just wanted revenge of the things. J.k. Simmons lived his character like that, I could find myself in place of Andrew and wanting to just quit and go home.This movie literally lives up with that kind of revenge when you just can't bear anything.But in the end this movie is also about not getting discouraged by mistreat or failure
cause in the end the one who practices more than the rest gets more than the rest.
I strongly believe everyone should watch this movie irrespective of the genre,
because you are nothing without a purpose and to achieve that purpose you need passion and this movie tries very hard to awaken that passion inside you and succeeds."
" Intense Authenticity
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,9,"There are times when watching this movie that you find yourself holding your breath as the tension pounds along with each beat of the drum.The performances of Teller and Simmons are exceptional. Their ferocity leads to many dramatic confrontations that take the movie to another level that drizzles with passion, which is what this movie is about.This movie carries a great deal of emotional violence that is managed brilliantly, particularly by Simmons, who for much of the film, looks as thought he is about to murder his entire band.The road to greatness doesn't miss a beat!"
" ""Funny games"", music edition.
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,5,"It's extremely popular these days in the silicon valley to claim , regardless of how much success you have yet to have, that it was the result of 'hard work' and certainly not luck. You know, these TED x talks encouraging your fellow man or woman to put in 19h days in front of the PC every day or be 'a sore loser'. Replace your meals with pre-made smoothies, don't socialize, it will all be worth in the end when you eat caviar at Harrods.In my opinion, this can only create a society formed of frustrated future millionaires with devastating results on mental health. Whiplash, however, begs to differs.It initially explores this theme using all sorts of unrealistic plot device to anyone with a basic understanding of music school, but it's ultimately at the 1h20 mark that it delivers a love story to bullying and self-effacement for the glory of 'being signed to blue note' (AKA money, getting rich).On the plus side, there's something organic about the style of filming in 'Whiplash"", and it's undoubtedly a pleasure to watch in that sense.There's also a great deal of risk being taken here, with a good 2/3 of the movie being just well, jazz (imagine the script ""Andrew plays, then plays some more""). So kudos for that, it's courageous no doubt, especially as it pulls off its ending brilliantly.These courageous decisions sadly do not stop the movie from leaving the audience wondering if they should root for a sadist or for someone so driven by success that he loses his humanity in the process... And offers no subtlety in its conclusion."
" Hilarious!
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,8,"I have loved JK simmons since the Mcguire Spider Mans and this just soldifies my appreciation for him. I have never laughed at insults like these since full metal jacket and the whole film all in all was arguably better. One I will likely watch again and recommend to people. Great music as well and I felt a special connection, since I was in band class as a drummer."
" Absolutely phenomenal
",2020-08-18 00:00:00,10,"Growing up, if I failed in something, my mother would comfort me; she would tell me that everything was okay, and that she still loved me. My dad would say and imply the same things, but he would also instruct me on the importance on failure, and how important it was to pick myself back up.My dad, to me, was a symbol of strength, endurance and resolution. He was someone that strongly believed in pushing yourself to, or beyond, your limit - whether it be the physical or the mental. Call him old-fashioned, but he really believed that if you wanted to achieve something truly great, you can't be coddled and comforted and be told that everything is okay, and that the second you feel any hint of doubt, you can turn back to your good-old comfort zone (""There are no two words more harmful in the English language, than 'good job'.""). That philosophy is something that I also genuinely support, and it has greatly shaped the man that I am today.And that is the personal relevance between myself and the film, Whiplash.We find our protagonist, Andrew Neiman, as an innocent young man. There is a great sense of ambition to him; he wants ""to be one of the greats"", but neither him nor the audience know what truly lies ahead of him, should he pursue that treacherous path. His father is a teacher and failed author; a representation of the fear that Andrew holds: Mediocrity. He fears being average, failing to be extraordinary. His desire is to be more than his father: exceptional.Andrew's other motivations for his ambition are also illuminated in the dinner scene with his cousins: ""I'd rather die drunk, broke at 34 and have people at a dinner table talk about me than live to be rich and sober at 90 and nobody remembered who I was"". He wants to be remembered, to leave a legacy behind. Greatness comes with fame, and that is what drives Andrew to his absolute limit.Terrence Fletcher, his musical mentor, sees this potential and drive in Andrew. Fletcher, with the same philosophy as myself and my dad, pushes Andrew to his absolute physical and mental limit through verbal and physical abuse. The result of this is Andrew's descent into near-insanity as he becomes obsessed with his towering ambition; he breaks up with his girlfriend because he believes she will hinder him from his pursuit to greatness, and it is revealed, during the aforementioned dinner scene, that he holds a sense of superiority over others because of his pursuit in this great goal. Furthermore, Andrew's absolute obsession with his ambition is highlighted when his car literally crashes into another truck, and he runs out of the up-turned car to sprint toward the musical competition, covered in his own blood. Fletcher, through his over-the-top methods, has created a machine, a young man who has lost his humanity, innocence and a sense for caring about anyone other than himself.This rupturing tension erupts as Andrew realises that he has failed to achieve his goal. His ultimate fear of failing to be extraordinary has caught up to him; in total disbelief, Andrew attacks Fletcher on-stage, resulting in his dismissal from the conservatory.Andrew is then lurched out of his obsessed, narrow-minded pursuit, back into real-life. He works a humble job at the restaurant, and he spends more time with his father. His innocence and humanity has returned.However, there is a palpable sense that there is something incomplete or off with his life - something seems unsatisfactory. That is the result of having no motivation or drive in his current life.In the most thought-provoking scene in the film, Andrew meets up with Fletcher after both of their dismissals from Shaffer conservatory. In their conversation, Fletcher reveals that he was at Shaffer to push his students ""beyond what's expected of them"". He then brings up the story of Jo Jones throwing a cymbal at Charlie Parker; saying that if Jones had been warm and assuring towards Parker, there would have been no Charlie Parker. Andrew answers back, asking where one has to draw the line. Fletcher retaliates, saying that the next Charlie Parker wouldn't never get discouraged; he then reflects at the fact that he never had a Charlie Parker. Andrew looks at Fletcher after the line is delivered, and you can almost see the gleam in Andrew's eyes: a spark has been set aflame as he returns to his drums.What then follows is the iconic final scene at the music festival: Fletcher reveals that this was a ploy to get revenge against Andrew as the band plays a song that he doesn't know. Andrew is shamed on-stage, Fletcher getting his malicious satisfaction as Andrew runs off-stage to his father's arms. At that moment, Andrew decides to turn back to the stage in redemption, as his father looks on in horror. There are many interpretations as to what drove Andrew to get back on-stage. I believe. in that moment, Andrew recalled the story of Jones and Parker, and that is what pushed him to get back on-stage; the realisation that if he wouldn't get discouraged by this moment, then he could truly be one of the greats. Andrew then plays a phenomenal solo in an incredible finale, echoing the solo of Parker after having a cymbal thrown at him the year prior.The scene is breathtaking, impeccably well-edited and masterfully-directed, but there is a slight ambiguity that pervades the final solo: Andrew has fully returned to his pursuit. No one knows what happens next, but one can be certain that at the very least he will have lost his innocence and humanity, possibly he will have lost them for good; there is also the possibility of a young suicide that awaits him. This is why his father had a look of horror as he saw his son go back on-stage, seeing him descend back into his obsessed pursuit of greatness. As an audience, we are wowed by Andrew's talent, but also horrified at what awaits him.The reason I love Whiplash is because it poses intellectually-stimulating arguments - Fletcher had a very fair and reasonable point: Charlie Parker would have never been the great he was if Jones had told him ""good job"". His intention is completely understandable, but one has to recall Andrew's retaliation: Where do you draw the line? Fletcher's methods resulted in the suicide of a 30-year-old, his former student Sean Casey, and the creation of a soulless machine in Andrew, a machine that could possible commit suicide like Sean Casey. Even now as I write this review, I don't know where to stand. Fletcher has a very good point, but do what extent to you carry that philosophy?To bring it full-circle - back to my dad. I agree and believe in my dad's philosophy: If one wants to achieve true greatness, you should be pushed to your absolute limit, and sometimes the person you love the most has to look you in the eye and say something discouraging - something other than ""good job""; something that will give you the drive to push yourself beyond your boundaries. What I found most peculiar is that Fletcher and my dad both believe in the exact same thing, but if there's something I've learned from film, it's that it's not about your intention - it's about your method. If my dad was a conductor at Shaffer, I'm sure he would've gone about it much more differently to Fletcher, despite the fact that they both have the same philosophy.Other than the layered and thought-provoking script, the film is, as I have already mentioned, impeccably well-edited by the tremendously-talented Tom Cross. Whiplash was the first film that made me aware of the editing, making me discover another layer to the invisible craft of filmmaking.J.K. Simmons also delivers an indelible performance as Fletcher. He lives and breathes in the soul of a border-line sociopath. He exudes shivering terror when he needs to, and is the highlight of every scene that he's in. An absolutely terrifying, yet terrific performance.Whiplash is a film posing thought-provoking ideas that I still grapple with today. Furthermore, the direction, sound, cinematography, performances and editing are absolutely phenomenal. The result is a near-masterpiece. Bravo Damien Chazelle."
" Absolutely amazing
",2020-08-18 00:00:00,9,"✨The shots✨ we're amazing and don't get me started with ✨the acting✨. Through out the film it made so nervous the non-verbal communication, I mean THE LOOKS sent me. Honestly I had very high hopes for this film and they were succeeded."
" Simply the best
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,10,If you love jazz and movies this film would be the closest you'd ever get to perfection. J.K. Simmons delivers his best acting performance throughout his career.
" Great movie, mega tension
",2020-08-10 00:00:00,9,"What a great idea of a movie, and how astonishing the performances of the actors were. J.K.Simmons's performance is just incredible and the Oscar proves it. A must-watch, a fresh tensionate movie that really changes the industry."
" Thrilling ride of human endeavour and passion
",2020-08-06 00:00:00,9,"Whiplash is musical Drama film, directed by Damien Chazelle with strong plot and masterful performances from Miles Teller and Veteran J.K Simmons. Miles Teller played the protagonist, Andrew in the movie who is a first year student in a prestigious music school. He aspires to be a world class drummer like Charlie Parker. J.K Simmons who played the anti-hero, Terence Fletcher who is a teacher in the best jazz school and is desperately searching for the next jazz superstar. Many think that Whiplash is a movie about music. But it's not. It's a movie about human endeavour, passion, anger and commitment. Andrew is very passionate to become the next Charlie Parker and is ready to push his boundaries beyond imagination to get the job done, whereas Fletcher is ready to push Andrew beyond any limits to make him the next Jazz Superstar. Masterful performances from both Miles Teller and the ferocious J.K Simmons more astonishing than ever for which he also received an Academy Award."
" It's great.
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,9,One of the best films out there. In 2014 there were several films that deserved the Oscar. It was a tough year. This movie though has something new. Something fresh. Something that exists around us.
" Silly
",2020-08-02 00:00:00,1,"Silly, I know a lot of drummers and this boy was close to a metronome. AMAZINGLY un realistic. If the instructor is THAT good, why isn't he gigging?"
" I didn't know jazz could do this to me
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,10,"The trio I didn't know I needed; Miles Teller, JK Simmons and jazz.I have never liked jazz, so when I started this movie I did not suspect that the music would end up getting me teary eyed. But that's exactly what ended up happening.Both Teller and Simmons are absolutely amazing in this, and the tension between them is palpable. It all comes to a boil in the end, which kept me wideeyed and almost holding my breath.Do yourself a favour and watch this movie!"
" Second time watching this movie
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,9,After watching this movie for the second time I still fell the powerfullness of the ending and the downfalls of our main character. I really think that even though Andrew success in the end there many storys like this in the real world where the stars have had rough teachers who have been teaching in the way Fletcher does. An inhumane way in my opinion. And this movie showcases how a teacher can change someone
" Yeap, this is a great movie.
",2020-07-17 00:00:00,10,"Some friends of mine told me that this film is no good. They are musicians. They tries to explain to me why this film is stupid and I simply ignored them because it's soooooo good. I don't know about music but I know that I was captivated by performances, story and resolution. 10/10"
" Powerful performances with intense drama
",2020-07-13 00:00:00,10,"Having heard of the strong praise about Whiplash since around its release in 2014 but not having being overly intrigued by the picture or having much of an interest overall, now watching for the first time. Can see as to why this film is as praise and held to such high standards.From the great performances by both leads Miles Teller and JK Simmons, to the overall plot and script, to the music, to the directing and the way it's scenes were shot, to the build up and tone, Whiplash is a one of a kind film. This film has a relatively short run time (littler over 1 hr 40 mins) as it does not drag and every minute is quite engaging.This film exceeded expectations and am somewhat disappointed as it took this long to finally getting around to watch it. Highly recommend, even if you are not a fan of jazz music, Whiplash is much more than music- as it is about a young mans dream of becoming great."
" The camera movement!THE EDITING!THE MUSIC!!!
",2020-07-11 00:00:00,8,"Wow, stressful, thrilling, captivating and ultimately satisfying. From the very moment Whiplash begins I was instantly both terrified and gripped by that opening drum solo. Within five minutes of the film I felt I knew everything about Andrew. Unlike Sergio Leone this film uses up every second of its runtime to tell its story. I won't go through the whole plot but musical numbers play a big part in the story , and while people often say ""a picture paints a thousand words"" I believe a song tells a million. There are many sequences in the film where songs are used to tell the story and I honestly felt I understood what was happening more than if the characters were talking.And nearly as impressive I never noticed when the dialogue stopped and the song begun , it was that seem less. In the final 10 minute crescendo of the film the camera and the editing reach their peak the the camera moved and cut to other shots was nearly as gripping as the music in a way reminiscent of Wes Anderson. This film exceeded my (very high) expectations , as I'm watching it in my challenge to watch the top 50 films on IMDb.

" It's Amazing
",2020-07-08 00:00:00,10,"Amazing I really like it a lot , the actors were good the movie was amazing I really recommend it being one who would like to watch a movie a musical movie for tonight it's really enjoyable it's a 10 out of 10 to me , have fun"
" Quite perfect
",2020-07-06 00:00:00,10,""" There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job.""Without a doubt, Whiplash is one of the best films of the last decade. It not only manages to capture a wide range of audience, but also to keep them glued to the screen for about an hour and a half. From the first few seconds of the film, you can actually already feel part of the story. Those seconds with the full black screen and the sound of the drums in the backcround are truly unique and I found them to be mesmerizing. Chazelle couldn't have found a better opening sequence, I believe.
This is not really a story about success, but a story about a young man trying to pursue his dreams while facing tons of obstacles and I think that each and every single one of us could easily identify in this story, as we all try to reach our goals one way or another.
Miles Teller portrays the young drummer Andrew Neiman, who is 19 years old and who just started to study at one of the top universities in the country. Teller is amazing in this film, as he successfully communicated the many emotions his character had to go through in this picture. You could actually feel the pain and the exhaustion while he was playing the drums. Then, there is absolutely no one else who could have portrayed Fletcher better than the great J.K Simmons. He took everything to the next level. Every single scene he was in was truly flawless and so magnificent. Everything about him in this particular film was nothing but perfect, from his voice, style and language to his way of approaching things. He absolutely mastered this role and this is why it is one of the best supprting performances I've ever seen and I dare to say that it might be one of the best supporting performance there ever was.
Damien Chazelle has proved once more that he is not only gifted and talented, but also very skilled. Each scene in this picture was so well directed and shot. He put so much passion in this film(as he does with everything) that it made the audience fall in love with Whiplash. His perspective of seeing things and storytelling is simply exquisite.
The cinematography in this film was absolutely beautiful and it made everything so much better. The colors told the story on their own and they played a big part in this film. Then, the score was nothing but perfect. It was ""the right tempo"". The film would have been so different without this score and this makes me realize how big of an impact the soundtrack had on me.
I highly recommend this film, as it is one of the greatest pictures of the last century. It is filled with amazing performances, unique direction and storytelling and it will make you feel so many emotions at once. You will feel exhausted, overwhelmed, excited, depressed, pleased at the end of the picture and this is one of the reasons this film is so great. It takes you through everything you wanna feel while watching a film. It will satisfy all your needs as a cinephile and not only. You don't have to ""know"" or ""understand"" music/jazz to be a fan of it. That's why this is a film for everybody, so go and watch it!!"
" A Remarkably Powerful Study on Ambition.
",2020-07-06 00:00:00,8,"""Whiplash"" is a real world masterpiece. Never a dull moment in this brilliant and powerful piece of cinema centered around a sadistic yet respected bandleader and his relentless pursuit for perfection. JK simmons was sensational and his Oscar was more then justified. This is truly a superb and beautifully orchestrated film. ""Whiplash"" will age as a classic."
" A wonderful movie
",2020-07-03 00:00:00,9,"It's very compact from the beginning to the end. The editing is crisp and rhythmic, especially for music performance. There are ups and downs of the film youth, but also the complexity of life."
" Whiplash Movie Review
",2020-07-03 00:00:00,9,"Whiplash is a drama movie directed by Damien Chazelle and stars J.K. Simmons, Miles Teller, Melissa Benoist and Paul Reiser.The movie starts on a very promising note and proceeds with the same positive pace. I liked the movie on various grounds. The plot of the movie is good and execution is simple yet effective. Screenplay is gripping and perfect with the screenplay is not dragged for long.Acting is perfect and Simmons did a perfect job and much deserving Oscar performance. Teller was equally impressive and perfect for his role.This is a must watch movie."
" Not an inspirational movie
",2020-07-02 00:00:00,8,"The film provides a different perspective, challenges traditional values, and has a refreshing feel.At the same time, compact editing, high-quality performances and unconventional portrayal of the relationship between mentor and apprentice are impressive."
" A great movie, A Must see, A Masterpiece
",2020-07-01 00:00:00,10,"OMG this movie succeeds in everything from the editing to the sounds to the music to the acting, not one bad decision, great structure, one of the best ending ever, Damien crafted the ending so well like he did with La La Land which also is Masterpiece.
Subjectively, I love this movie, because it's very inspiring to do movies and also to do not give up, because if someone is passion about something he will get what he deserves in a way, follow your dream"
" Good tempo, great beat!
",2020-07-01 00:00:00,10,"This is so much more than just a film about a drum student at a jazz college. It's a film about obsession, sacrifice, emotional abuse and the relentless drive for perfection!The two main characters are JK Simmons teacher, and Miles Tellers student. In many ways whilst each character has redeeming traits that draw you in, you never really warm to them. Each displaying on many occasions narcissistic characteristics, and a total abandon for anyone else, all in the name of Jazz! If anything the one thing they agree on, is everything else is secondary to the principal goal of achieving greatness.The tension during the movie is at times excruciating, and held almost at will, Simmons In particular creates incredible almost palpable tension...never have the words ""Not my tempo"" been uttered quite so menacingly. He thoroughly deserves the Academy Award.The climax of the movie is just masterful, key characters facing off, fantastic camerawork working in sync with the music, and a scene that you feel the whole movie has been building towards.The subject matter of this story is simple, the execution though is sublime, masterful storytelling, one of the best films of the last few years."
" Excellent
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,7,"Rhythm. The editing of the entire movie stepped on each of the most exciting lenses, and the progress of the clouds and waters. The performances of the two starring actors were also out of frame every frame. All the priorities in the film seemed to be a natural combination."
" Succinct in Sixteen

Must-watch"
" Let Down By A Single Plot-Hole, However, Aside From That, It's A Masterpiece
",2020-06-23 00:00:00,9,"Pros:
1. The editing is spectacular. The cutting speeds up and slows down to greatly harden the impact of the scene being shown.
2. The music is wondrous. It's obvious that Damien Chazelle (Director) has either a real passion for music, or that he took time to carefully research it.
3. The famous ""Are you a dragger or rusher?"" scene is one of the most intense, captivating, and terrifying scenes in cinema.
4. Miles Teller (Andrew) and J.K. Simmons (Fletcher) both deliver phenomenally masterful performances.
5. The story is beautifully paced, and despite the lack of content, it never once loses tempo.
6. The dark and brooding lighting, not only enshrines the film in a mesmerising glow, but it also helps to effectively heighten the tension.
7. This movie helps to explore abuse, more specifically, it explores the relationship between the abuser and the abused; how it affects the victim, and the changes to said victim; in addition, it explores how destructive the abuse can be on everyone affected, including the abuser. The film does all this in an intelligent and nuanced manner.
8. The conclusion is simultaneously uplifting as Andrew takes one step closer to becoming a great, but it also ends on a depressing note as you witness Andrew falling back under the spell of his abuser.Cons:
1. There is just one problem with the plot. It's never explained how, or why, someone could have stolen the drum notebook without Andrew noticing."
" Film review
",2020-06-19 00:00:00,8,"The movie was good. The story was brilliant, the actor liked the actor (J.K. Simmons) It was good. The music was amazing. But la la land remains better than whiplash ."
" Not sure why this is so highly rated
",2020-06-18 00:00:00,5,"The trailer showed promise and whiplash looked like it was going to be a great movie. However, I left the movie feeling as though it was incomplete. The film failed to make me connect on an emotional level with main character Andrew and therefore, left me feeling like an awkward fly on the wall during most scenes. The film also seemed to glorify the idea of putting yourself through physical and emotional abuse in order to attain approval from those above you. There was no moment of liberation or growth from the main character and likewise there was no moment of realisation or acknowledgement of wrongdoing from the villain. Overall it felt like an incomplete film that almost condoned abuse if it leads to approval."
" My life's most relatable movie theme 👌
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,10,"In my top 10 favourite movie list. I promise myself to watch this movie at least once every year.This is one of those movies where I agree completely with the antagonist.Outstanding and Oscar deserving performance by JK Simmons. Now even when I get frustrated I do his closing-fist hand gesture.A masterpiece by the young the Damien Chazelle. I give him a lifetime pass and ganna watch all of his future films with no questions asked.
The outstanding cut-scenes editing and capture of drums playing couldn't have been done any better.Now for the themes
I love this so much that I wrote my university application essay starting with a dialogue from Fletcher.
The idea to pushing someone backwards so that they rise forward is completely my life in a nutshell.The movie shows this recurring theme multiple times. Fletcher didn't take in Neyman to his band because he was great, but he took him because he saw this guy has immerse dedication and hard-work. Neyman works harder when someone proves he is not worthy of something.Rise - Neyman selected in band
Fall- Fletcher almost decapitates him, in the
iconic Rush-Drag scene
Neyman not main drumer
Rise - Neyman plays well in the show as he
has learned Whiplash by heart. he also
loses the script, I still believe Fletcher
took it
Fall - Fletcher brings in another player
intentionally to rise Neyman
Rise- Neyman masters the act even after hard-
working till 2 am and hands all blooded up
Fall- Neyman's accident
Rise - the dedication of still playing with blood all over his bodyAt the climax Fletcher intentionally doesn't give Neyman the script to make the ultimate Fall. There rises Neyman playing the greatest solo the world has ever seen.Fletcher trick doesn't work with everyone as they gett demotivated from music. He is a really bad teacher and this flaw as antagonist makes the movie much better."
" A Great and Intense Film!
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,9,Whiplash has got to be one of the most best written and well made film that has ever been made! You can really feel tension and the fear in this movie! J.K Simmons has got to be one of the best parts of this movie! His acting is spectacular and you can really feel the anger on his voice when he gets mad. Miles Teller did his role so great in this movie! A drummer striving for greatness but becomes too obsessed on his goal of being one of bests. The music is fantastic and the screenplay is beautiful! More people need to see this movie and see the beautiful story of Whiplash. (It might be you're tempo)
" MASTERPIECE
",2020-06-15 00:00:00,10,"This time I want to review my best film of all time, whiplash directed by damien chazelle who directed the film La la land, the first thing I like about this film is the acting of JK Simmons who according to me that it went too well, and also the acting of Miles Teller who directed the film La la land amazingly good, I really like the way of shooting, the way the camera moves, I like it very much, not to mention the synopsis which is very interesting I like and maybe this kind of film doesn't have it anymore huh! If we know and we watch now most of the films are drama, comedy, or action genre, according to me the three film genres are getting more and more now, films with drama-music genre may now be rare, maybe there was only one year or it could be nothing at all. Rating for this WHIPLASH film I give you a 10/10."
" AMAZING!
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,8,"I tell you I HATE la la land so much that make me not to watch any movie of Damien Chazelle again.
I try couple of time to skip whiplash because of this.
And finally I decided to see it based on the review.
It's a GREAT movie it focuses in one thing it's like you trapped in one stressful state of mind through out the movie . It's simple yet very complicated with deep character building you can see it without going though every situation in details to make the point. I love the ending so much. How it's build the tension in everyone opinion matters but at the end noting matter except the moment we waiting for all through out the movie in weird time, place and situation ,earning the part is finally there the tempo is finally perfect, pain becomes pleaser after giving up hope in reaching perfection he can see what he thought was crazy."
" 1st Ever Review
",2020-06-11 00:00:00,10,"Astonishing film, even without an interest in jazz or drumming I found this film totally captivating. Actors are amazing and I don't hesitate to give this 10/10Logged on and set up an account so I could give this review"
" great
",2020-06-11 00:00:00,8,"From beginning to end, whether he succeeds or fails, the atmosphere is oppressive. The picture is cold and grim, with Fletcher always saying the most awful things; He was like a judge, the devil in every band member's heart. He was indeed a ""pervert"" who not only verbally insulted the band members, but physically attacked them as well. Then the clothes dapper appearance with elegant words for their abnormal behavior to find a respectable cover."
" Impossibly good
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,10,This is a masterpiece film and it's the first film this Director ever made. A complete control of his craft on his first go. What an amazing film. I'm blown away.
" Wonderful movie
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,9,"The director's control of music can be said to have reached its peak (referring to the director's screenwriter Grand Piano the year before last, although that plot is extremely bad, the piano performance is the same as the film. The high-speed editing caught up with David Finch in an all-round way, and the nearly abnormal struggle between teachers and students brought the audience a thriller-like suffocating pleasure when the main character was driven to a dead end several times."
" Masterpiece!
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,10,Frickin' masterpiece! I'm not interested in jazz music but i loved it. J.K. Simmons awesome acting. I recommend this film to everyone.
" A remarkable mix of ""Full metal jacket"" and ""Black swan""
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,7,"""Whiplash"" is about the relationship between a young drummer (Andrew played by Miles Teller) and a dictatorial instructor (Fletcher played by J.K. Simmons) at a New York music academy.The dictatorial instructor acts (and talks) very much like sergeant Hartman in ""Full metal jacket"" (1987, Stanley Kubrick). However, the victim of sergeant Hartman is the wimp of the group, who is lagging behind by each excercise. The victim of instructor Fletcher is an (over)ambitious student. For this student Fletcher is not only a bully but also an idol. A complex relationship of attract and repel arises. This relationship is more in line with ""Black swan"" (2010, Darren Aronofsky) than with ""Full metal jacket"".""Whiplash"" can be seen from different perspectives.Andrew faces the choice between ambition and social life. He chooses for his ambition, sacrificing his girl friend to his drum kit.Instructor Fletcher has to decide how demanding he has to be with respect to his students. He decides to be very demanding. In his eyes: ""There are no two words in the English language more harmful than ""good job"""". To utilize the full potential of that one talented student he does not shy away from burning down the many average students.In my opinion one very revealing scene is when Andrew is back home. The moderate succes of his nephew in American Football is higher rated than the succes of Andrew in one of the most demanding music academy's of the country, something that made me think of ""October sky"" (1999, Joe Johnston). After that, there is a conversation a the dinner table. This conversation centers around the question what is the essence of success, is it money or is it fame? Andrew has a pronounced opinion about this question. Referring to Charlie Parker he says: ""I'd rather die drunk, broke at 34 and have people at a dinner table talk about me than live to be rich and sober at 90 and nobody remembered who I was."".""Whiplash"" is a multifaceted film. J.K. Simmons plays Fletcher in a very convincing style and he got an Oscar for this role. However convincing he was played, the character of Fletcher is not very plausible. His behaviour mavbe accepted in the army, a music academy is a very different world (I hope)."
" Inspirational
",2020-06-04 00:00:00,9,"The synopsis of Whiplash never really peaked my interest enough to commit to watching the film. However it's impressive ranking in the IMDB top 250 eventually forced me to bite the bullet and give it a chance last night. I am so glad that I did.In essence, the story is about a student striving to become the best, and a ruthless teacher pushing him physically and emotionally every step of the way. It does not matter if you have no interest in jazz or music at all for that matter, the themes are applicable to sports, singing, dancing - any competitive walk of life that requires the utmost dedication to get to the top. Anyone serious about doing so should watch Whiplash and use it as a source of inspiration.Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons are incredible and the success of the film cruxes on their performances. Teller was most surprising, as an actor I'd only previously seen in the occasional rom com, in this role as the ambitiously determined student willing to put blood, sweat and tears into becoming the best. However it is Simmons who swept all the awards (including an Oscar for best supporting actor), playing the role of Teller's vicious bullying mentor and cramming every scene with tension and fear. He is an enigma and a rollercoaster - just when we think we understand his complex character he turns aggressive again and humiliates Andrew (Teller) once more.As dark as this sounds, until literally 5 minutes from the end of this film I had no idea if our protagonist was going to triumph and finally win the respect of his mentor or end up killing himself. The stakes are really that high, and overall it makes for 100 minutes of incredible drama that you can't take your eyes off. I'd recommend Whiplash to anyone. 9/10."
" Tense, powerful, inspiring.
",2020-06-02 00:00:00,9,"Whiplash kicks off the key Damien Chazelle theme that his career will no doubt follow. The beautiful creative energy between Chazelle and Justin Hurwitz has managed to create a timeless classic that is both inspiring and as tense as anything seen before. Wonderful film that is captivating from the first moment.Room for improvement: The romantic B story becomes awkwardly unresolved but in the grand scheme of things, it creates a more inward focus on Andrew's real passion."
" I found no real flaws with the film. It will have you engrossed from start to finish.
",2020-06-01 00:00:00,9,"As a drummer, this was an exciting movie to watch, and my excitement didn't die out during the rest of the movie. I personally haven't had a band teacher as abusive and insane as Fletcher, but I know that there are definitely people out there like him who teach this class. Anyway, point being that this is on my Top 10 movies I've seen so far. It's a must watch, even if you don't like movies about music."
" No doubt this is a masterpiece.
",2020-06-01 00:00:00,10,"J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller are phenomenal in this gritty drama, but the climax and even the catchy jazz music makes this a masterpiece. Also watch out for Damien Chazelle, he could be the next big filmmaker in Hollywood."
" Terrific and terrifying actor
",2020-06-01 00:00:00,7,J.K. Simmons really steals the show here. This film puts a horrific twist on the usual aspiring artist plot by throwing in a very alarming figure who distresses and abuses his students. Yet they stick around because they feel this is their only path to greatness. Is it worth it? This film explores the consequences.
" Intense and realistic
",2020-05-30 00:00:00,9,"As someone that wanted to persue art as a career and worked beyond my limits for long years, this movie is really close to my heart.In my own life I had a teacher who was similar in many ways to Fletcher (but of course not as abusive) and I know from first-hand experience what it is being in the limit and keep going, what it is to cry compulsively and keep going, what it is to try desperately to please someone who is treating you incredibly bad.
I have to say that that teacher made me improve exponentially and made me realize that my limit was much further than what I had previously thought.Of course my experience wasn't as abusive as Andrew's, but he represents perfectly the strength of someone who will do whatever it takes to pursue their dream.An incredibly well-crafted story!"
" Best movies till date i have seen
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,9,"No words to describe the acting of the actors in movie..especially the hero and his teacher..
A young man carving for his ambition in life and how far he can drive till the end of life...even after if he lose anything..
A comeback story for a hero inside everyone of us who r all praying for a time to reveal ut.. a must watch movie.."
" Kept me on the edge of my seat!
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,8,"Wow this was such a highly intense film, which I did not expect at all. It made me very hyped up and energetic while nervous of what happened next in this film.This film is about a young drummer aspiring to be the next biggest hit. As he came under a mentor, he started having a high dunk of himself. Too high. This was a very intense ride of a film as you saw the uprising, downfall and once again uprising of this young drummer. The acting in this film was phenomenal besides that, especially the performance of this young drummer, played by Miles Teller. He truly only saw one way out which was forwards. He got blinded by success, but in the end managed to escape the spiraling downfall he was getting into.This film honestly made me quite speechless, as probably can be seen from my review, because I am writing this right after having finished the film.I recommend everyone to watch this film even if you don't find drumming appealing at all. because this film surely will keep you on the edge of your seat like it did to me."
" My favorite movie of all time!!
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,10,"This movie is a complete masterpiece. Everything about it is good and the acting is over the top! I loved this movie becuase when it finished it really made me think. There were about 3 different meanings to this movie. One is actually pretty nice and happy' but the other two are very dark. I am not going to go into detail but you can check it out on the internet. In conclusion, GREAT film, my favorite film actually."

" Powerful
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,8,"Intense movie, great actors, good written story. Just wow!"
" Suspenseful, but the overall plot is just quite tedious
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,5,"First off, the acting was brilliant. There was such tension between the 2 main actors and I felt a real sense of unease whenever they were together, which did not let up throughout the whole film.
The music and drumming was enjoyable, but often a bit tedious. The repetitiveness of it though does add to the dynamic between the 2 characters, where Fletcher the conductor doesn't accept anything less than his own absolute perfect.The side characters such as Andrew's dad and the girl of interest weren't featured enough to have much of an impact on the story, except for that their scenes together made me care less for Andrew. I kept questioning throughout the film his and the rest of the band's dedication and allegiance to Fletcher. As if Fletcher alone is the be-all and end-all of their careers as jazz musicians. It just didn't seem realistic.There were enjoyable aspects of the film, but I didn't feel there was enough of a plot development, or the development it did have I found myself questioning or thinking it didn't flow well with the characters."
" Not quite my tempo!
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,7,"JK Simmons gave a really good performance. He looks and plays the part pretty well. I partly agree about pushing people to get their best.
And the movie is so good to just ""hear"", the Jazz band and the drumming.
I loved being in the environment of music school and their rehearsals.
In some scenes, Fletcher looks more like a military commander, which was too dramatic I think.
Good movie."
" The Best Teacher-Student Story of the Decade
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,10,"Teacher-Student stories are increasingly common in recent films. Teacher is harsh, students pushes themselves, they become better. This film pushes the limits on what that story can be.
This film has astounding acting, fantastic cinematography and beautiful storytelling. If you are a film critic, this film will astound you. If you are a musician, it will be an experience of terror, hope and triumph."
" Exactly my tempo!
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,10,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I remember the first time I watched it I was so captivated that I wished the movie would go on and on and never end. Especially during the solo at the end, I was so completely mesmerized I forgot to breathe. The main character, played by Miles Teller, is very relatable. The character is everyone of us who are ambitious and driven, and have a thirst to prove ourselves. Miles Teller was able to play that part so perfectly, you forget you're watching a movie. It is almost like watching someone in real life. He is such an amazing actor, it is sad that he is so underrated. I hope he gets more good roles like this in the future.And Damien Chazzelle, please make more movies about Jazz.Totally recommend it. 10/10"
" Stupid and absolutely ridiculous movie
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,3,"I'm not even one of those people who think bullying is categorically wrong or useless. I even think it's important in some areas. But it makes absolutely no sense when artistic creation and music is involved. The fact that the movie is about jazz, which is urban meltingpot garbage, makes the entire drill instructor routine even more ridiculous.
If you see it as a satire/comedy, it's quite funny though."
" Twisted studies.
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,5,"I love the J.K. Simmons in this film, he was fantastic. His anger was always scary and awesome to look at. But that's all this movie is, psychological study porn."
" Think Black Swan, but drumming
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,6,"A psychological drama, accompanied by some jazz music. This film takes perseverance to a whole other level, and not necessarily in a good way.From the moment we are introduced to Fletcher, he demands the screen. Ruthless in his verbal insults, and extremely intimidating - he inspires mostly fear amongst his pupils (and weirdly they still seek his approval). His methods of mentoring are torturous, both mentally and physically and it was astounding to me that he justified this later in the film.Neiman (Teller) is spotted by Fletcher and begins his transformative experience to becoming one of the greats. Throughout his interactions with his Fletcher, the close up shots really showcase Miles Teller's acting skills. You can see the determination on his face, and his anguish when Fletcher dismisses him. It was really easy to empathise with his character, especially when his spirits were crushed by Fletchers vicious slurs. *spoliers*
As the plot progresses, Neiman's ambition becomes obsessive and borders on neurotic (especially when he is involved in a car crash, gets up and walks on stage covered in blood and begins to play the drums). This was a very absurd moment in the film.It made me angry that Neiman still sought Fletchers approval after everything he put him through (pushed him to the brink of insanity/publicly sabotaged him/plunged him into depression and almost forced him to abandon his dream). I wouldn't say there is anything inspirational about this film, and Neiman's triumphant drum solo at the end is still contingent on Fletchers approval of him as an artist. It kind of sends the wrong message that in order to succeed you need to go through hell; blood, sweat and tears.The ending dragged on longer than was necessary (there's only so much of a drum solo you can take without thinking ... are you finished yet?) Regardless, Teller & Simmons together was a gripping watch."
" Beautiful.
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,10,"This is a moving, amazing and astounding movie!! I would definitely recommend watching this!"
" Deserves 1st place
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,10,"Excellent acting, Excellent camera shooting, excellent light, excellent final"
" Absolutely captivating
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,9,"Whiplash is an absolutely engrossing and character-driven drama boasting incredible performances from J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller as the unforgettable Fletcher and Andrew. Whiplash asks you questions about true passion and whether violently harsh teaching facilitates of drives it away, and the film refuses to give you answers. If you think that the point of the film is that Fletcher is a terrible teacher and a crazy psycho, (you're wrong) you still have to wonder if he is a part of why Andrew is as passionate as he is. I do not condone his behavior but I posit that his role in success (and, perhaps, failure) is massive."
" Creates the spark in you to do more
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,6,"Whiplash is by far the most motivating movie to all musicians.
The direction is absolutely flawless and innovative. The less spoken dying jazz culture is brought under the lime light of pop culture through this film.The accuracy of executing minor details is unbelievable. The story line is very simple yet thrilling at certain moments. It provides us with a spectrum of how hard one should try to reach his goal, the movie being in the far right hand end of the spectrum.Actors Miles Teller and J . K. Simmons couldn't have done anything more to do justice with the characters. Such terrific acting skills are rarely seen.Overall, the movie lives up to the hype it created."

Hahahahaa ridiculous... ) , I think this story is wrong on so many levels... We don't get to see his LOVE for music , all we see is a sad, pathetic, disrespectful , neurotic human being obessesed with an idea of ""becoming great"" and the movie tells us that there's nothing wrong with that..."
" The rhythm is very good
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,8,"If you still have time to think about the inhumanity and distorted character relationships in the film, you may miss the most wonderful part: rhythm.

" ""There are not two words in English languaje more harmful than «good job»""
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,9,"Whiplash, with so much passion and energy, is a film that expresses what it is like to sacrifice for art. What is really beautiful, above all, is the journey that Andrew undertakes, and the many mixed feelings in between: the desire to be ""the greatest"", the passion he feels, the mistakes he makes in between. The first protagonist's impact happens just at the beginning, when Fletcher interrupts Andrew while he is rehearsing to invite him to his class. Fletcher takes the place of the ""anti-hero hero"": we all come to hate Fletcher and his practices. However, personally, at one point, I understood -when Fletcher tells Andrew that he always tried to create a new Miles Davis- that everything happens around that: a method. After all, the dream of many musicians -like Andrew- to be the best is complemented by Fletcher's aim. Andrew is pushed by the fear of failure (because of his father's case) and by his dream of being a great musician.This is not just a movie about music or a drama, it is also a psychological movie. There is a constant psychological fight between two people who are very attached to their positions and opinions, and seeing their collisions is the most intense to see in terms of performance. Is it necessary to say something about J.K. Simmons? And of course everything is demonstrated not only through dialogues and performances, but also visually: Fletcher is not only scary and abusive, he also always dress in black, he's a big guy, and has an intimidating face. His room has a different shade of light than the rest of the conservatory, it's much dimmer. The drums crescendo in each scene of tension, a sad piano playing in the scenes in which Andrew surrenders.What to say about the end? Damien Chazelle does it again, he leaves us stunned. In this moment, we see the most important decision of the whole Andrew's path's: after an embarrassing moment and a brief ""triumphant"" moment of Fletcher, Andrew returns to make his double tempo, independently of what Fletcher orders him, because he himself knows that he can do it. Fletcher's reproaches not only doesn't matter to him, they give him even more security. Andrew can finally see Fletcher without fear and Fletcher's gaze now says it all: he had never seen someone playing like that before. Far from being an antihero, he becomes an ally, who nods and assists Andrew. Finally, you don't even need a shot of Fletcher's entire face, just seeing his eyes we understand what's happening.This movie isn't only for those who want to appreciate two hours of what good performances and technical details are, it is special for dreamers, music lovers, and art lovers."
" Ruthless! quasi! Cool!
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,9,"The director's control of the music can be said to be at the peak (refer to the Grand Piano of the director's screenwriter the previous year, although the plot is very bad, but the piano performance is also exactly the same as the film), the high-speed editing fully catches up with David Finch, almost perverted The teacher-student wrestling brought the protagonist to a thrilling suffocation when the protagonist was forced to the dead end several times. Finally, the big explosion of the reversal of control status can only be described in three words: ruthless! quasi! Cool!"
" There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job.
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,8,"This film mainly tells the story of a teenager who is determined to become a top drummer when he meets a strict teacher. Under the teacher's devil training, his skills and willpower continue to improve, and he finally completes a perfect work on the music stage.
The director is very skilled in the use of light. Different lights further explain the situation and inner emotions of the characters in the film like the audience.
At the beginning of the film, the method of pushing the lens is used. At the end of the dark corridor is a practice room. As the lens continues to move forward, the scene of the picture gradually becomes only the practice room. A white light illuminates the The teenager who is seriously practicing alone in the practice room is completely immersed in his own world. He is the best drummer here. At this time, the teenager has some pride. The teenager suddenly stopped the drum hammer, as if he found something. As soon as the picture turned to the teacher standing opposite the teenager, let the audience know that the promotion of the camera was actually the promotion of the teacher 's perspective, and the teacher stepped forward step by step. As I walked, my slow steps seemed to imply an examination of the teenager. The teacher stood in the dark and asked the teenager to walk. The light was shining from the top of the teacher's head. The solemn and majestic image came out. At this time, the light on the teenager was not as bright as before. Leaning forward, subconsciously swallowing, and anxiously answering questions before the saliva is fully swallowed, all show less emotional tension and anxiety. After thinking that he had received the teacher's acquiescence, he showed himself in front of the teacher, and the teenager's face showed bright lights. He was to be praised by the teacher, but he got a ridicule from the teacher. When the teenager concentrated on drumming Close the door and leave, so that the light on the teenager's face dimmed again. They suddenly opened, and the teacher came in. The young man thought that the teacher had changed his mind. Maybe he still had a chance, and the lights appeared on his face again, but the teacher just came in to get the coat. The young man 's face was bleak again ... After the teacher left, the angle of view switched, for everyone It shows a panoramic view of the practice room. The whole color is turquoise. The large practice room is only a young man sitting next to the drum, and the thousands of lights outside the window make the younger more lonely. In just four minutes, the director not only explained the identity, relationship and personality traits of the two, but also showed the psychological changes of the teenager through the lighting, showing the ups and downs of the character 's innermost heart, and tightening the audience 's heartstrings and tense atmosphere Come out spontaneously.
The film also appeared dark green light tones many times. The first time when I was alone in the practice room, the feeling of loneliness and disappointment blended with the green. The second time was when the three drummers were trained by the teacher in turns and blamed for nearly three hours. On the way home, the dark green light shone on the tired face of the teenager. The third time was when the teenager went to the show, the bus tire of the bus punctured. When the rental car arrived, it was discovered that the drum hammer had forgotten to the car rental company. On the way back to the drum hammer, a car accident occurred. The teenager struggled to climb out of the car, regardless of the car over the ground. Disregarding it, he ran to the scene of the performance in a bloody head. When playing on the stage, the screen lights were dark green, and the teenager was unable to complete the performance normally due to physical injuries and was unable to handle it. The film was edited at a fast pace on the way to the scene when driving to the scene and on the road back to the car rental company. The young man's heart was like a tight drum surface, nervous and hesitant. The use of the green light three times showed the uneasiness and depression of the teenagers, all of which appeared when the teenagers experienced negative emotions, and could cooperate with the psychological feelings of the teenagers.
At first, the teenager was very self-respecting, with a little pride in his heart. He kept the videotape where he was playing drums when he was a kid, and choked with his family at the table, saying that he would rather live a successful life, even if he could only live to the age of 53 Asked to live to the age of 90, he thinks he can be a great and top drummer. He is a confident and confident child. But when he joins the teacher 's orchestra, he always receives insults and abuse from the teacher when he trains with the teacher. He even beats him and throws him a chair. The teenager slowly begins to recognize himself, but he is unwilling to accept the spirit of losing and wants to correct his name. The wish made the teenager work harder. The arrogance of the teenager was dulled. He wanted to be a strong person like a teacher. The light on the teenager shone on the teacher. After reconciling with the teacher in the bar, the teenager was invited by the teacher to board the performance stage again, only to find that this was just a conspiracy. It was the trap set by the teacher for reporting his own revenge. After a long period of training by the teacher, the teenager's willpower increased. Not only did he not leave in a hurry, but instead he went on stage to forget to play, and brought his level to the extreme. The teacher was gradually shocked by the teenager. At this time, the bright lights were transferred from the teacher's body to the teenager's body, and the teachers and students also resonated. This video uses a camera shake to quickly express the passion of the teacher and the students, and the success of the teenager's performance with the teacher's excited movements and expression.
The theme of this movie is that there is no madness and no survival. Finally, the hearty performance of the male host and the teacher's expression all indicate that the male host has reached a kind of ecstasy, a kind of ecstasy."
" Clash of egos between two artists
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,8,"When a person sets his dream as a goal and goes for it, he is unstoppable. When this path collides with another one that goes in the opposite direction, there can be an explosion of egos and a debate of feelings, which can only end, in the case of Whiplash, in acceptance by art. Blood, sometimes excessive, sweat and tears are part of a difficult process where you must risk everything, family, friends and love. Damien's ability to build a character, making him close to the viewer but without taking us out of what is really relevant, is magical."
" work up
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,8,It 's very nice. I think it 's a very realistic film. The one who can really succeed is often able to endure the torture of loneliness and pain ... and the one who is the least crazy and does not survive
" great
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,7,"The film misleads many young music learners and parents, believing that you can become a genius through crazy practice. In fact, people are born with the limit of motor nerve, and it is useless to practice without talent. As for the bloody drumming scene, it's also virtual and can't be taken seriously."
" Represses

" Excellent film
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,8,"Those who dislike it because of the sadism are people who just do not know how to see a movie. Good screenplay, great actings and great work from the director. This is a just a story which you wether like it or not, but you can't criticise it because of the sadistic parts and less criticise how realistic this is when we are talking about A FILM, it doesn t need to be 100 per cent real you idiots. If by watching this you feel really intense or somo anxiety then that is what you are supposed to feel, the idea of the film is for you to get those feelings and that is not bad. I mean no one critices for example a horror film for its sadism or unetical scenes, far away from that you see it to get scared, so it is the same here, doesn't need be totally real."
" Incredibly and powerful!
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,8,"This movie was far better than the trailer made it look.JK Simmons gave a stellar performance as a music teacher in the best Jazz school, trying desperately to find and develop the next jazz legend. From the moment he appears he demands the screen, literately. There's a part in the flick were he just burst open the door putting a halt on whatever is going, and makes it all about what he wants, which sets the tone for the entire movie. One of the best antagonist I've seen at the movies.Miles Teller plays the protagonist, A first year Jazz student who wants to be the next Jazz legend and is willing to go through the pain needed to become just that. I've been a fan of Miles Teller for a while and this movie just increase my fandomIt does not matter whether you are into jazz or not, this flick is about and boy willing to kill himself to become the best and the man willing to kill the boy so he can be the best. For anyone who has ever been in that kind of pressure, weather it be at college or on the playing field(I kid you not, watching these guys play Jazz played out like I was watching a Football movie with Miles being the Quarterback and JK being the coach)It was an emotion trill ride with a lot of ups and downs, and just when you think the ride is over, we go for a second time around.Excellence!!"
" Beyond limits
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,10,"This movie is full of bloody sweat and tears in life, full of irritability and anger. But I have to admit that Fletcher's methods are effective and also very terrible, because it is difficult for everyone to guarantee that they will not be abandoned halfway. Fletcher didn't believe in the warm encouragement, he said: There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job. What he pursues is to force the musicians beyond their own limits with absolutely necessary brutal means, and they will never be discouraged by pressure. All the wonderful and amazing appearances come from long-term preparation and unremitting efforts. Therefore, without paying hard work and persevering with perspiration, tears, or even blood, how can you achieve a remarkable life?"

" It's not the inspirational movie you think it is.
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,8,"Much of the film's success came from its tight editing, excellent acting and unconventional portrayal of mentoring relationships. Admittedly, the film editing is sharp and accurate, except for a little slack at the end, the whole film is more like an action suspense film, the rhythm is accelerated again and again, the conflict is escalated again and again, the film ends, 107 minutes imperceptibly in the past. The film's treatment of the music is also quite careless, showing the attention to detail and professional spirit."
" great!
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,8,"I believe that everyone who has practiced musical instruments or sweated in art performance can find a profound resonance, the respectful and fearful feeling of strict teachers, want to draw their energy, but feel the suffocation that is forced to the cliff , Want to be more technically perfect, but found that music is more than just these surprises and fears."

",2020-04-02 00:00:00,10,"Watched this movie a while ago, and i'm surprised i didn't watch it sooner. there's something about this movie that makes it really relatable in terms of perseverance, and also shows how unrealistic people's expectations can be. an amazing watch overall, loved it!"
" A Great story about Inspiration
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,8,"A Great story about Inspiration. I believe you do not need to be a musician to understand this movie simply it was great. this movie just not only show us but taught us how you can achieve anything you what in your life with motivation, dedication, an most important thing hard working. by the way I liked this dialog a lot "" I'd rather die drunk, broke at 34 & have people at a dinner table talk about me than live to be rich and sober at 90 & nobody remembered who I was"". I should say that was great play by Miles Teller & J.K. Simmons & What nice Movie by Damien Chazelle."
" Whiplash is one of those movies that with the passage of time is getting better and better.
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,9,"The message that this movie reflect about fight for what you want without excuse is amazing, and is demonstrated in every moment with Andrew ( Miles Teller ) and his desire of being one of the best drummers of history. The moments where he practise with his hands full of blood are savage.Also the performance of J.K. Simmons as Terence Fletcher is awesome. His performance is a 10/10 and I think that his Oscar is deserved by far.I love the final scene when Andrew start playing the drums with his soul and his blood and all he could give until do it practcally perfectly."
" A Master-piece
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,8,"A classic movie which can be watched time and again. Feet never stop tapping through the movie. Truly inspirational. Hard-word, practice and success and the way teacher mend his student. Clever goosebumping end."
" Just my favorite movie here. Love the acting and everything about it is great.
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,9,"Easily one of the greatest movies of the decade. Amazing plot, interesting and complex characters, flawless acting and memorable scenes. And the way that it respects music is just fantastic. The only issue that I have with it, is the fact that it doesn't really focus on the side characters (take Andrew's family as an example). But this issue is so small compared to the good things of the movie, that you don't even think about it. A really amazing masterpiece that I highly recommend."
" Astonishing, Mind-blowing, Glorious.

" choice of life
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,10,"Ideal and life are never contradictory, but a matter of choice. To be ideal, stand firm against the slap. The purpose of the spur is to make it progress. If you want to live, then go all out and give up your ideals completely."
" A genius who does not work hard will eventually become a mediocre one.
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,8,"This is not the case in life. Society is advancing, humans are advancing, and everyone is advancing. Due to human progress, this series of progress has been promoted. Effort is the foundation of progress. Even genius cannot escape the fate of hard work. As ordinary people, what reason do we have for ourselves to fall. I very much agree with this statement. A genius can be a genius because he can think of things that everyone cannot think of, and he can do things that everyone cannot. Then he became a genius. If he didn't work hard before that, how could he think of it. In this way we grow, thorns and bumps everywhere. Maybe something that is important to you is very important to others. It's like you think you are very interesting and you are eager to find an interesting soul. But actually I think everyone is interesting, just find an interesting person that matches your own taste. Therefore, we value what we value and continue to work for it. We don't need to care about the ridiculous and ridiculous words of others, we will do our best to pursue and realize. Life should be like this, harvest pain and joy on this road."

" Ya. Wow.
",2020-03-12 00:00:00,10,"Don't know why it took me so long to write a review for this movie, I saw it almost 6 years ago and have seen it probably around 20 times. I honestly don't understand why it's so good. Like it actually boggles my mind. Like I think about it almost everyday. And the one thing that really pops out to me the most is probably the cinematography and lighting. I never thought that the color orange would be such an amazing color in a movie. But it really captures the drama, and hardship of both these characters. And the way they filmed it is just hecking amazing. And we can't forget the acting. I had always loved Jk Simmons before this movie came out, I remember watching him in the Spider-Man movies and he would make me just laugh my butt off. But in this movie, oh my god is it just astounding on how good one person can act. And also miles teller gives the best performance of his career and he doesn't get enough credit, I think he definitely deserved at least an Oscar nomination for his work. And this is coming from an 18 year old, yes I did see this movie when I was 12, but even then I knew that they were doing something right. I'm sure this is a little too late to say, but if you haven't seen this movie, I don't even know what you're doing with your life honestly."
" WHIPLASH (2014) - 26/02/2020
",2020-03-10 00:00:00,10,"Definitely up there with my favourite films of all time. I won't discuss performances too much because there isn't anything I haven't said, they're astonishing. The underlying message of sacrifice in order to achieve greatness is well-told. Characters had their own motivation and challenges along every step of the way. Music and fast drum beat keep you awake throughout. Great storytelling. The directorial work is also topnotch and technically outstanding. Captivating long shots and masterfully executed camera work draws the audience into this brilliant study into obsession. The movie maintains a nearly relentless pace throughout without losing an ounce of its allure. A simply breathtaking study in how carefully chosen scenes and razor sharp dialogue can do true justice to a film's message and theme. A must see movie and a true classic in the making.Mitchell Bulfin"
" Summary
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,7,"The story begins with a young kid who was practicing drum and found himself been observed by his teacher who later puts him in the core team and tried to push him towards his limit but instead end up destroying his carer by expelling him from the university. the boy later avenge him alleging him with putting his students through mental and physical trauma, but later they eventually meet each other in a BAR where they had a small friendly conversation, Then his teacher again give him the opportunity to join his team and the boy happily accepted, however the teacher was aware about the boy's allegation because of which he was also asked to abdicate from his position. so in order to take the revenge he puts the boy at a difficult situation on the stage where he played a different music which his student had not practiced but that does not stopped his student. He pushed himself to a limit which makes his teacher to finally find a talent he was looking and then they both put on the great show for both the audience."
" Great Movie
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,7,"The entire movie was revolving around a extremely talented guy and his teacher, who pushes him to his limit but it seems little less convincing as they have shown him struggling and bleeding but it takes more than that to get to the level which was shown towards the end of the movie. There was very less story about the other side characters, overall the movie was great as the message it holds was clearly delivered. There were few twists which were difficult to be anticipated which makes the movie more thrilling also. It could have been more better if they had stretched the movie a little more."
" One of the Best of All Time
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,10,"This film contains all we need in high level: directing, writing, sound, editing, movement, twists, drama, tension, energy, hero, antihero, characters...we go with the wave/vibe.
Man, this is wonderful. Thanks for the class. This is PHd."
" Good-looking, Well-acted crap movie
",2020-03-05 00:00:00,1,"It's hard to express how much of a crap movie this is; it's not bad-movie crap, but it's evil-movie crap. Although a lot of playing drums is shown on screen, it's not about drumming; neither is it about music, jazz, teaching, or personal growth. I'm pretty sure this is one of those philosophical, personal-growth essays cleverly disguised as a real story, but it's not only inaccurate about personal growth and learning, but about music school and jazz in particular - insultingly so - it assumes that Bobby Knight tactics work in a teaching environment.
I'm giving it the rating for very specific reasons - starting with one, because that's the least I can give it, and adding one of J.K. Simmons, just because. I'll add one more for Miles Teller, who did his best at a script of abuse, bullying and justified sadism. I'll add one more for the production quality but subtract three for the waste of Melissa Benoit, who actually has the only line from Reality Earth,""What the f**k is wrong with you?"".The point is: I'm a music school veteran and graduate from two pretty good schools, and have taken training from several other teachers and institutions. I've known many many teachers of varying quality; some were very demanding and clear about what they wanted, and others were less so; some were very supportive and others less so. I learned something of value from each one and consider them some of the best people I've known. I've never known or known of anyone who was anything like Fletcher in wanting to tear down the student's personality. But the movie presents him as not a borderline personality disorder but as a successful paragon of motivation and excellence - making every drill sergeant ever depicted on screen look like Mr. Rogers. It really is boot camp hell - why would somebody ever consider staying in a band or a school like that?
It's depressing to read all of the 10-star reviews, many from professional reviews - what the hell?; there must be a built-up appetite for believing that ""greatness"" results from a masochistic desire, not to suffer, but to be made to suffer at the hands of someone who has nothing to say about music. It's interesting to read the other reviews and backlash essays by people that have an acquaintance with music and music school, making the point that this isn't anything but a Hollywood dream of what music school and personal growth is like."
" LOVE THIS MOVIE!
",2020-03-05 00:00:00,10,"As an avid Chazelle fan, I absolutely adore this movie! I think musicians like myself will appreciate the little things in this film, but there's something here for everyone to love. The color palette of the film gives you a mood to look forward to, with great editing, awesome music by Justin Horowitz, and amazing acting by our leads! Overall, very enjoyable film and would totally recommend to literally ANYONE!"
" Couldn't even finish watching it
",2020-03-01 00:00:00,3,"As a drummer, this movie is total BS. Music is an art form, and supposed to be fun. Speed doesn't have everything to do with drumming."
" Misleading and disappointing
",2020-02-26 00:00:00,4,"As a musician I was really looking forward to watch this movie. Sadly I was deeply disappointed, and upset watching how they represent musicians. I've been a musician since 28 years, and never seen any teacher or band leader acting like this. Music is not (!) sport! No place to yelling and terrorising people in the band. Under this insane pressure nobody could do good music. I know about some guys who are great musicians but very hard to work with. Of course, it happens. But the musicians I know would never work together with an obviously insane person, who use this kind of methods to make the musicians play better. It wont work. This movie has nothing to do with reality. I am angry and frustrated that people now think music bands works this way, because they dont."
" I cried. My favorite movie OF ALL TIME !!!!!
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,10,"The most influential movie I have even seen. Especially if you are a real musician who does not use samples or arpeggiatiors to produce music, this movie is for you. Real temper, real emotions. We all fell the same like this characters. I am watching this move at least 5 times a year. Strongly Suggested!!!!!!!!!!"
" A movie that stays on the beat!
",2020-02-20 00:00:00,10,"When I first watched this movie, I didn't understand why the instructor was being such an asshole. Now, after revisiting this film, I understand why.The underlying message of sacrifice in order to achieve greatness is well-told. Characters had their own motivation and challenges along every step of the way. Music and fast drum beat keep you awake throughout.Great storytelling.5/5."
" this film is not about actual car whiplash : misleading
",2020-02-19 00:00:00,9,"Miles teller is not a good person in this film !
drumming is not that deep.
damian chazelle : willing to die for jazz"
" Unrealistic
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,3,"A bald, psychotic ""teacher"" verbally, emotionally, and physically abuses drummers, sometimes to the point of suicide. It's almost hard to watch. The main character is a masochist who crosses paths with the teacher and it's a match made in heaven.
They don't explain why other than the drummer, all the band players are mute, or why the ""teacher"" doesn't abuse them too.
Very hard to buy someone getting hit by a giant truck and walking away. Are they hinting at super powers?"
" Where passion meets insanity.
",2020-02-08 00:00:00,9,Great performance by Miles Teller and an outstanding performance by J.K. Simmons. This is without a doubt best movie of Damien Chazelle and yes that does include La La Land.
" Whiplash: A jazzy masterpiece
",2020-02-04 00:00:00,10,"An absolutely incredible movie about a jazz drummer determined to become one of the greats. While not accurately representing how jazz musicians train (nobody goes until their hand bleeds, that is counter-productive, in fact, but as said by Adam Neely, real practice is really boring and hard to romanticize (e.g. practicing scales for 5 hours, like Adam Neely did). I refer to (can you guess who?) Adam Neely's video on this movie, as I found it to be much more educated than any of my thoughts could've been. Cinematographically, the movie is absolutely incredible (lots of depth of field and interesting camera angles), and the color palettes are fantastic. The main character is difficult to only root for or hate for: he's quite nuanced, and can be a dick, and makes decisions most people would never agree with (dumping his girl because he needs more time), but we also understand his desire, and we respect his determination and drive to become one of legend. J.K Simmons' performance as the abusive teacher that pushes for greatness and perfection, nothing less, is one of the most powerful in cinema history and one of my favorites. That and Spiderman hunting, eh?"
" WHY DID I WAIT
",2020-02-03 00:00:00,9,The question I've been asking myself the past hour is how on earth I bypassed this at the movies and even more how I've let it sit on my watch list for 5 years!? JK and Teller are phenomenal. I was on the literal edge of my seat for most of the movie. This movie grabs your attention from the beginning and it never let mine go.
" What drives you?
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,9,"What drives you? What is your obsession? Does it drive you? Does it define you? Is perfection still not good enough? This film explores this, as well as a highly abusive approach to push people to greatness. The ending redeems it somewhat, but the whole think is kind of uncomfortable to watch. At the very least, go out and buy the soundtrack because this film had some superbly excellent music."
" Best movie of the decade
",2020-02-01 00:00:00,10,"Miles teller does an amazing job. J.k Simmons was absolutely fantastic, and this movie made me love the sanity slippage genre. Love it!"
" What a MASTERPIECE!!!
",2020-01-28 00:00:00,10,"Everything about this movie is OUTSTANDING. The direction, performances, music, filmography create a fenomenal moment. All is so well directed. I literally end up clapping alone in my living room when the final scene ended. All the awards this movie won should be enough to tell. Personally I think it deserved even more. J.K. Simmons is incredible in every detail, best performance i saw from him!
Even if you arent a jazz lover, this is a MUST SEE."
" A suprising sleeper.
",2020-01-27 00:00:00,10,Until you see it you have no idea that this well made movie can deliver the emotions that a person with strong determination & convictions from within can dish out and take to push oneself for acceptance to be the best as teacher to student and student to teacher.
" Incredibely strong movie for any musician
",2020-01-26 00:00:00,10,"This used to be my favourite film for a few years just because of how powerful this movie is. It motivates you , It changes you , and it shows you what is happening behind the lives of succesful musicians."
" You will want watch again this film
",2020-01-25 00:00:00,10,When he hit to the drum you will feel your stress on his stick. A good struggle story..
" JK Simmons does a great job of being an asshole
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,4,JK Simmons does a great job of being an asshole. In my opinion that was the only thing I liked about the film. Most people are raving about this but I must have missed the mark.
" One of the best films of the decade
",2020-01-21 00:00:00,10,"Whiplash is one of my all-time favorite movies and inspired me in more ways to than one. The performances by Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons are unforgettable and feel so real throughout the entirety of the film. The cinematography and editing are nearly perfect and Damien Chazelle does a fantastic job for his first film behind the camera and I believe he was snubbed from a best director nomination.The writing is fresh and original and is a film that captures the viewer attention and never lets go. Miles Teller's character Andrew shows resilience and extreme determination to accomplish his goals ,but at the same time losing focus and sight of things that are truly important in his life. The great thing about Whiplash is that there's no true protagonist, Andrew is the main character, but makes many decisions that are not ""hero"" like if you will, and can be selfish to those he truly cares about. The film shows the limit one should go to pursue their dreams and the consequences of crossing said limit.If you want to watch a movie that will inspire, thrill, and educate you on themes that are hard to touch on, then Whiplash is the movie for you.I was utterly shocked reading some of the negative reviews for this film. Many reviewers gave it one star for being ""unrealistic"" and ""condoning bullying""; I strongly disagree, but they are free to share their opinion."
" Masterpiece
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,10,"Genius, elegant, efforts, every single tear and sweat are valuable here.
Good job"
" An example of its own doctrine
",2020-01-16 00:00:00,1,"Whiplash the movie is a perfect example of the artistic idea its story seems to be espousing for its entire length: that technique counts for everything, and heart and soul count for nothing.Any professional musician (and I am one) will tell you that, as far as the study of music goes, this is wrongheaded and inaccurate in almost every way. Yes, hard work is necessary, and technical skill is important, but that's a given in almost any field. However the story depicts almost none of the other most important realities of studying and playing music, least of all the JOY of doing it. But then this film is really not about the desire to be a musician, or an artist of any kind. It's about wanting to be perceived as being THE GREATEST. In other words it's all about ego - how one wishes oneself to be described.True artists work at their art because it's what they want to do and they get fulfillment from doing it. Whether they are ""great"" or simply ""good"" can be left to others to decide - their focus is on following their passion and developing their voices. Good teachers can help them find their path. But Fletcher, the teacher in this movie, is - well, psychotic, really. There's no other way to describe his delusional artistic ""philosophy"". And there's certainly no way to defend his destructive methods. His ludicrous tantrums are supposed to have the effect of ""inspiring"" growth, but never is he shown actually TEACHING his students anything. All he does is inflict emotional, psychological and even physical abuse on them. The idea that this guy would last more than a week in any teaching institution is absurd. Yet it feels like the filmmaker is asking the audience to seriously consider that there may be value in this method.But then the writing overall is ultra-problematic, because it is not rooted in any reality - the two principal characters may as well be living on another planet. Some of the principal plot points don't make any logical sense at all: in the final jazz festival sequence, why on earth would Fletcher, for his big ""comeback"" moment on the NY music scene, invite a drummer to come play who has not been practicing with the band, and then deliberately set him up to crash and burn? To get revenge, clearly - but all it would really do is make Fletcher and the rest of the band (whom Fletcher clearly cares not a whit about) look bad. J.K. Simmons is a very accomplished actor, but there is nothing to his character beyond his psychosis - Simmons gives a performance I felt he could have done in his sleep (basically his character from ""The Closer"", with a humorectomy). Miles Teller is OK as the student, but his character is not sympathetic because he never seems to be doing music for the right reason (i.e. a love or passion for it). He's doing it to ""prove himself"". Most people do not become musicians for that reason.And just as Fletcher completely negates the heart and soul of playing music in favor of emphasizing pure technique, so does Damien Chazelle avoid exploring the heart and soul of his subject, concentrating instead on flashy filmmaking technique. Admittedly, the technical aspects of Whiplash ARE superb: the photography, editing, and film scoring are all done so well that they almost succeed in distracting from the basic hollowness and dishonesty of the story they are servicing.Normally I would give more points for such filmmaking finesse, but I feel incredibly offended by such a false portrayal of a life work that I have intimate knowledge of. I will grant that all the technical fireworks give the story a degree of drama and excitement, but so much of it feels artificially earned. A massive demonstration of style over substance, Whiplash is, at its core, meaningless, and I can't give it any more than 1 point."
" An incredible motivation
",2020-01-09 00:00:00,9,"The film gives an incredible motivation. There were a lot of young people who started drums with this film. if you like drums, you should definitely watch this movie."
" It's more than a movie
",2020-01-09 00:00:00,10,"""There are no two words in English language more harmful than good job',"" Fletcher said to Andrew. This quote deeply dropped into my mind.Avoid people who only praises you, their words can stop you from pursuing your dream. You should always tell yourself that the sky is limit.Just follow your dream and don't seek compliments. Yeah, it should be, but if no one gives you critics, even not reasonable, you won't become great. You need work your fingers to the bone as Andrew did. He said that he would rather die drunk, broke at 34 and have people at a dinner table talk about him than live to be rich and sober at 90 and nobody remember who he was.. That is definitely a strong trait of his character.So happy that this film has won so many awards, it's really worth watching!"
" One of the best
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,10,I've always found it harder to review amazing movies like this. What can you say about a masterpiece of cinema other then it's amazing. Whiplash hits every beat it needs too and blows away anyone looking for a beating of a movie.
" Not quite my tempo
",2020-01-05 00:00:00,10,"I don't really know what to say about this film, is stunning.Just Kidding Simmons and Miles Teller probably give their best performances and it's a masterclass of a film from Damien Chazelle."
" Astonishing
",2020-01-02 00:00:00,10,"Whiplash is an astonishing drama about peoples passion for their work that's unexpectedly intense, thrilling and full of suspense. Miles Teller is gives an incredible lead performance and J.K. Simmons is perfect and instantly increases the tension from his first scene. Damien Chazelle's direction is incredible and the film is extremely well filmed. The pacing is great and the musical score by Justin Hurwitz is excellent."
" What a film!!!
",2020-01-01 00:00:00,10,I never thought a film about a drummer could be this good. I have never been so tense!!! I was literally on the edge of my seat.
" ""Whiplash"" is astonishingly beautiful and different!
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,10,"Wow! I mean WOW! How did I let this movie pass me by when it first released, because I can wholeheartedly say that ""Whiplash"" is a modern masterpiece. Never in my 16 years on this earth have I ever been as captivated by a movie as I have with this one, and I'm not even a musician. But yet, this movie managed to pull me into the screen, preventing me from ever taking my eyes off of it, and letting me be sucked into this world.I mean, what else can I say, this film is just amazing. J.K. Simmons has perhaps one of the best performances I have ever seen. He is so real, you feel for Miles Teller's character because what transpires between them doesn't feel like something that was written and performed. It doesn't feel like acting. It feels real and that is also due to the script and the direction these amazing actors had.This is also an incredibly funny movie. Seriously, everytime J.K. Simmons opens his mouth, it's usually to insult someone in an hilariously crude way.Also, this film has one of the best 3rd acts of any movie I have ever seen, with a finale so climactic that I litteraly didn't avert my gaze for a second, in fear of losing even the smallest detail.There is only really one very minor criticism I have for this masterpiece, and that is the romance subplot between Miles Teller's and Melissa Benoist's characters. It just felt to me like it didn't go anywhere and didn't bring much to either character, but I'm just grasping at straws here.Perfection is not easily achieved, but I'm very confident in saying that in ""Whiplash"", perfection was achieved in every way possible!A+"
" Fan-freaking-tastic!

",2019-12-27 00:00:00,9,"Never do I recall giving a film a 9/10 well there was no 9.5 cuz no film is perfect. I hope someone one an Oscar for this beyond the editor, b/c what a compelling performance J. K. Simmons. I always saw cuts from the film in filmmaker reviews and the performance was serious. Finally watched it and WOW what a film. If you like Black Swan it would be impossible not to like this film."
" For Jazz lovers
",2019-12-26 00:00:00,7,"The film will appeal to jazz lovers. You start to get bored for moments, but there is motivation in the film. J.K.Simmons played great!The film did not surprise. You can see once."
" Please do not pay attention to the morons who gave this film a negative review
",2019-12-25 00:00:00,10,"I took band and orchestra in school from grade 4 until my senior year in High school. I played drums. It was the highlight of my school years. I too had a band instructor with characteristics like the one in this film. His name was James Mitchell. Although he was nowhere near as intense as the star of Whiplash, he was still over the top. He would throw drum sticks at the percussion section. Knock over music stands. Bite pencils in half. He demanded greatness. He never hit any students but he made a few of them cry. I loved this man.
If you don't think this movie deserves at least an 8/10 I think you just don't appreciate music. I gave it a 10/10. The musicians are awesome. The acting is awesome. The story is brilliant.
I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did, all three times."

" COPIED!
",2019-12-07 00:00:00,10,"There is so many excellent great things to say about this film. To start off I will say it may be slow and to different for some to enjoy and so that I warn you. Now I will say that I can not express the idea enough of how surprising this film is. Jk Simmons does an outstanding performance as the highly unpredictable hair trigger tempered teacher Fletcher, Miles Teller an actor who I've only seen in mediocre comedies also shines in a breakthrough performance as the ambitious drummer Andrew. The performance are outstanding and that's just the tip of the iceberg.My favorite thing about this film is how it has created it's own one of a kind spot in the music genre of film, it's atmosphere is unlike any other as well. The idea that this film is one of a kind can't be stressed enough, I guarantee you cannot find another film out there like this. This film expresses a shockingly high intensity for a music film. I believe that Jk Simmons acting is what fueled a lot of the intensity. When you watch this film even though it's pace will seem slow to most it's intensity is impossible to miss.I can see how a lot of certain people may find this film hard to enjoy but for me this film as slow as it is couldn't have been more intense. The mere fact that a music film shows some strong intensity like this one did is mind blowing to me. I don't know how many of you had this same experience or something similar then you already know what I'm talking about. I have a good feeling and I'm hopeful this film rakes in some acting Oscars because this film deserves at least one. I haven't read anything on this films page and I'm sure others have expressed similar opinions and all I can say is listen and trust me. I'm praying you enjoy this film and experience it's one of a kind intensity just as I did. Thanks for reading my review and enjoy."
" Extraordinary movie
",2019-12-04 00:00:00,9,"An extraordinary movie, anyone who appreciates music will love this movie, Cinematographic language, as well as the excellent actor's performance, takes you into resilience and passionate story."
" Great Movie Film!
",2019-12-03 00:00:00,9,Great actors and the plot of the movie was really powerful.
" WHIPLASH, vulgar display of musicianship
",2019-12-03 00:00:00,1,"It is a rightful way to be so horrific kind of figure
that is means death for a milisecond mistake
in the most prestige music school whatsoever
yet some way to achieve perfection, in the name of
unreal Hollywood fantasy again...even if i give a head
with those deadly perfectionism...there will only
a cold music monster machine than a human. Just imagine
every player kill each other for just a milisecond whatever,
surely this unreal fantasy of Hollywood should be stoped
before it gets real and be a disaster..."
" Driven To Extremes
",2019-12-02 00:00:00,9,"Trying to be the best at anything can frequently come at a price for anybody famished enough to want to go for it. This is especially true when we talk about fame here in the United States, where it seems Vince Lombardi's mantra ""Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing"" is something that is far too instilled in our culture. This is personified in the 2014 film WHIPLASH, the film that put its writer and director Damien Chazelle on the map in a big way.Miles Teller portrays Andrew Neimann, an aspiring 19 year-old jazz drummer who has enrolled himself at New York's Shaffer Academy, where he comes to the attention of music instructor Terence Fletcher, portrayed by J.K. Simmons (who snagged a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role, and rightly so). To say that Simmons' teaching methods are unconventional would be a monumental understatement. Simmons' character Terence Fletcher is the musical conservatory equivalent of Lee Ermey's drill instructor in director Stanley Kubrick's 1987 Vietnam War classic FULL METAL JACKET, a man who is more than willing to push all of his students, but none more so than Teller, to their musical and even psychological extremes with a whole host of basically shouted scatological imprecations and more than a few choice four-letter words. Teller's own father (Paul Reiser), despite being proud of his son's dedication to the art of jazz drumming, fears for his son's own sanity under Simmons' near-psychotic dedication to the art of perfection, to the point where Teller's hands actually bleed onto the drum kit. Getting involved in a car crash (the same kind of incident that a previous student had while struggling to cope with Simmons' methodology, and which led him to hang himself), Teller finally goes to the authorities and finally gets Simmons 86ed from Shaffer...something that Simmons inevitably finds out about. But it is Teller who will have the last word.Based to a large degree on the experiences Chazelle had had in his high school's band, which led him into filmmaking, WHIPLASH is an often-exhausting film to watch...and at times, deeply unsettling. Simmons, gets results by hurling the most demeaning insults imaginable at the students in general, and Teller in particular, because it is his belief that he can get the next Charlie Parker out of these guys, something that, by his own admission, he had never been able to do. To him, the two worst words any teacher can say to any student are ""Good Job""; he'll accept nothing short of perfection, because to him Jazz is a dying musical genre in America. Chazelle, to his credit, even though he both wrote the screenplay and directed the film based on his short film of the same name, doesn't necessarily see perfection as a bad thing, but he doesn't exactly believe that Simmons' method of getting there is exactly a good thing either. Teller does a yeoman job of showing us how his character's dedication to perfection, having to somehow ""please"" a tyrant who is all but impossible to please even on the best of days, drives him almost to the brink of psychical exhaustion and even a psychological breakdown. It is not hard to put ourselves in Teller's shoes, because some of us have been in this position a time or two, with a character like Simmons here (and Ermey in FULL METAL JACKET).But even with the experience of the first thirty minutes of Kubrick's great movie and Ermey's performance in there, the whole of WHIPLASH, with Simmons and Teller battling back and forth, is emotionally and psychologically draining, especially when compared to the carefree spirit of Chazelle's next film LA LA LAND, and the awe-inspiring FIRST MAN.WHIPLASH is a extremely masterful character study. But be prepared for its emotional extremities"
" Wow
",2019-11-26 00:00:00,10,"I very much enjoyed watching JK Simmons in the show Counterpart but was not prepared for this. No clue who the young kid is but he did a great job. But I was surprised to learn JK earned a supporting actor award because this was his movie. Having said all that, a love of jazz will help you appreciate this movie but is not necessary because it's really about the definition of success"
" Powerful movie
",2019-11-24 00:00:00,8,Powerful effect. Accomplishes what is sets out to do
" Absolutely grotesque, distasteful, disturbing, perverse, sickening.
",2019-11-11 00:00:00,1,"This film is completely overrated. Having seen the other wonderful films from Damien Chazelle, La La Land and First Man, I thought Wiplash would be also a good one. What a mistake, what a waste of time and money! Is this film trying to ""prove"" that without the most absurd pushing, abuse and bullying no great artist is possible? Absolutely grotesque, distasteful, disturbing, perverse, sickening."
" best movie from chazelle
",2019-11-05 00:00:00,9,It was an emotion trill ride with a lot of ups and downs. chazelle is the best new director and knows how to makes strong drama.
" Astonishing performance
",2019-11-03 00:00:00,10,"This is a very unique movie even u are not into jazz but still can drew u into the atmosphere of it without moving your eyes.My eyes were dry after seeing this movie.Miles and Jk portray it flawless .Jk remind me of ex employer will use your weakness background against you if anything go wrong.Director done very well using camera angle to capture the face of the actor to create the tension in it.Have to admit I hate Fletcher brutal teaching, but most of the music icons were pushing to their limit practice to perfectly everyday,so he is not entirely wrong also.just my fantasy,it will be great if this movie can use 120fps technology to capture the facial expressions of two lead actors."
" Powerful Movie
",2019-10-30 00:00:00,9,I absolutely loved the storyline in this movie. It was so great to see a musician themed movie centre around a thriller. The cast were top notch. Simmons as usual was to die for. Teller was believable and formidable as the protagonist. Yes!
" Interesting and intense!
",2019-10-28 00:00:00,10,"Really interesting take on a highly competetive environment. Rhytmic and engaging, the movie plays just like å drum solo!"
" A modern day classic and JK Simmons is nothing short of brilliant !
",2019-10-24 00:00:00,9,In this movie we can see the spectacular performance of Teller and Simmons in a drama jazz movie. The Big Band music an the performance of the musicians makes you want more from this movie.This movie reminds you how hard can the life be with you and how you can beat this challenges no matter how difficult it could be.
" an original piece
",2019-10-24 00:00:00,10,A truly fascinating and original movie that captures your gaze at every moment.
" A movie about competition but not music.
",2019-10-15 00:00:00,6,"First, I will start off by saying that this movie would be perfect for non-musicians. This may be a great gateway movie into understanding or even appreciating music theory or jazz for that matter.May themes in the movie seem to be on the border of Hollywood hogwash when it comes to how over-the-top and unrealistic the scenes are.I understand they do this to entertain as spread out of a demographic as possible. But I feel it teeters on the verge of offensiveness to Jazz, Music Schools, and education. The amount of allowed abuse that went on in the movie was a shock factor for viewers and they dragged it out so much to the point of extreme abuse.
The director has said they wanted to flirt with abusiveness in the film. But I felt that what they did was beyond ""flirting"".All in All the movie had great acting and really good cinematography. A lot of the playing in some scenes was completely fake but allowable and some scenes of the movie will really hit home to people who grew up with an obsession for music or a music background.The movie never took you out of the moment, it kept you in the seat for the whole time. But after the movie was over it left a cheap thrill ride taste in my mouth. Many of the complaints about the movie could seem pedantic, but they are hard to ignore when a movie has such a specific theme they are working with.All in all, I give the movie a 6/10 and I would recommend as a good intense movie with a music background. Especially for people who are not musically inclined."
" Compelling at times, but over the top
",2019-10-01 00:00:00,6,"While I thoroughly enjoyed the performances by the two lead actors, as a drummer myself I feel the musical situations/scenarios of the film are often exaggerated and overblown. I've been in many of the same situations as both teacher and student, and any teacher who acted the way this one does wouldn't last out the week (I actually know of a teacher who struck a student and he was dismissed the same day). Additionally, although I understand the student's intense desire for success, the lengths he is depicted going to are often counterproductive and even absurd (playing until his finger bleed for instance). I would welcome a little more balanced, intimate look at the often very complex relationship between an experienced but demanding mentor and his/her ambitious, aspiring student."
" Such a moving movie.
",2019-09-17 00:00:00,10,I literally felt how the demand was portrayed by both Andrew and Terence. Jeez. I wish to see more movies of this caliber.
" I used to be a drummer but then I stopped.This movie made me want to be a drummer again.
",2019-09-15 00:00:00,10,"This movie is a fantastic story based off of a short film made a while before the movie came out.The movie is fast paced, musical, and unintentionally funny for some viewers like myself. I found the film very dramatic and found myself really feeling and sweating for the character. Though, the characters cussed in scenes so much to the point where it was kind of unrealistic, I thought it was absolutely fantastic and I'd even consider it on my list of favorites."
" I love it
",2019-09-11 00:00:00,10,The movie was very great and so amazing i love the end and the actors especially J.K. Simmons
" Best one...
",2019-09-09 00:00:00,10,There is so many excellent great things to say about this film.Maybe I can say best musical film ever.
" Intense, emotional, nonstop action
",2019-09-08 00:00:00,8,"The film deserves all the praise it's got. It's an intense movie that comments on obsession and passion, and shows that masterfully within the story. The plot is very consistent and it never falls in intensity. It also takes some unexpected and fascinating turns that add to the story and help keep our interest. The characters are greatly crafted, particularly Andrew and Fletcher. This leads to us really empathizing with Andrew and understanding his obsession but his feelings as well. In my case, I could feel what Andrew was feeling, due to the great job done scriptwise. The climax is intense. My only, very small complain is one of Andrew's supposed flaws: he can't have friends since e doesn't see the point of it. We comments on that with Nicole and then again with his family at diner. However, we don't really see him refuse to make a friend. He certainly doesn't have friends, but not because he refuses to, but because the other people are jerks. Anyway, that is a very small thing and doesn't really affect the greatness of this movie."
" Yes!
",2019-09-05 00:00:00,10,"Immediate entrant into my Top 100 Films of All Time. Interesting story exploring an unusual theme: (How much should greatness cost?); terrific acting; deliciously devious ending. And, that's just after seeing it on an airplane with horrible headphones and looped dialog that took out all the dirty words: (""You freaking fruitcakes!""). Haha..."
" I must have watched something else
",2019-09-02 00:00:00,3,"Another example of where I must have watched a completely different film from everyone else. The character development isn't just lacking, it's practically non-existent; the ""great cinematography"" is undoubtedly impressive but only comprises of comedy drummers' faces. The message of the film is dishonest and trite. Nothing good I can say about this."
" Unrealistic
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,1,Way over done. Didn't care for it at all. Being a music in one form or an other most of my life it felt so fake as my learning process was a joy not a boot camp experience. Simmons mannerisms as the professional left me cold.
" A masterpiece
",2019-08-30 00:00:00,10,"This film is a tightly wound watch. It's perfect in it's execution, and always intentional. The shots, the pace, and the motivations all flow into each other. Do yourself a favor a allow this ode to ambition to draw you in."
" It is the wonder of low budget filmmaking
",2019-08-21 00:00:00,10,"Whiplash (2014) - (MA)
TONY SAAD - MONDAY, 12 JULY 2019STAR - STAR - STAR - STARMusic is a key to a memorable satisfying film, and Damien Chazelle's Whiplash is no exception. The energy of double-time swing, and the spontaneity of drum solos really reflect the nature of this film. It is ruthless, and at times painful to watch. The inspiration, and the reality of it all is a testament to how music really shapes our lives even in the slightest of ways. At its simplest, Whiplash is more inspirational than a raging AFL team on a hot Australian summer day.Whiplash follows the story of Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller), a budding drummer at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory in New York. He strives to become a world-class drummer like Buddy Rich. The Conservatory is conducted by Terrence Fletcher (J.K Simmons), who will do just about anything to push his students beyond their potential.This film is all about music and musicians. Andrew joins the Shaffer Conservatory with the hopes to become a professional drummer. His passion directly impacts his relationship with his friends and family. I think Andrew is one of the most dedicated protagonists out there. His story alludes to those of many Jazz artists including Charlie 'Bird' Parker and Hank Levy. But he is not entirely innocent; his relationship with Terence is causing his fall among his friends and family.This film is also one of the tensest non-horror films I've seen recently. Chazelle took inspiration from old thrillers in developing the story, which was evident in the conflicting emotions of the characters. A Thriller is not a horror film! It is the genre in which no character is innocent i.e. they all engage in abuse of law (Murder, theft, cheating, you name it) and they have got few -if any- allies in their quests. For example, Neiman is our hero, but he intentionally distances himself from his family and breaks up with his girlfriend to work on his drumming. Fletcher is pushing his students very far, but becomes very violent whenever he has a fit. And as a result, his relationship with his students is very toxic. Throughout the film, you cannot help but be on your nerves all the time, because Whiplash is just plain aggressive. It's as if it is forcing us to keep watching in anticipation of what may happen next; who will hurt whom? What will cause the fall of our protagonist?Of course, the highlight of this film is the music. Whiplash is not an ordinary musical -the characters do not burst into song all the time-. The songs are sourced from famous Jazz artists like Hank Levy, and composed by Justin Hurwitz. I just wish I could watch the Shaffer Conservatory play the OST in front of me, or even better, me playing the drums with Neiman. My favourite pieces were Caravan and Too Hip to Retire, because I could not stop air drumming after having seen tis film.The film showcases the beauty of music better than The Greatest Showman. While the latter is grandiose and spectacular, it feels like a series of music videos sewn together. Whiplash is better than that. In fact, it is the wonder of low budget filmmaking. Even if it was a series of music videos, it's a lot more entertaining than The Greatest Showman. Through Andrew and Terrence's relationship, Whiplash pays homage to jazz and its artists beautifully. It is also an inspirational story of how a little bit of determination and commitment can make all the difference in the toughest of times.© Whiplash Film Review, 2019.

" Eye opening,simple,on point and and left you wanting more
",2019-08-16 00:00:00,9,"This movie show u the man behind the legends who try to do anything to push them to their best at any cost and musician who dedicated his whole life to music and have to be best to survive because jazz is dying in this situation only two things can happen u either become a legen who are the last hopes for jazz or no one....Both actors have given their best,"
" A well-made, modern masterpiece
",2019-08-12 00:00:00,10,"JK Simmons and Miles Teller, put them in a drama movie with lots of dialogues heavy scene and monologues, and a solo drum performance, what you'll get, a masterpiece. I just want to see both of them again in a movie together.I've never been a huge fan of musicals. But it's not really a musical anyway, it's the story of a guy who knows who's good at something and an unlikely mentor who wants one protege to achieve greatness.This movie works for me because I can relate to Miles Teller's character, so many of us have seen ourselves very best at what we do. And then someone comes and gives us a reality-check, and says ""practice harder"". Anyone who wants to be best in his field will feel for this guy, but the movie works because it's not just about him. It's also about a teacher played by JK Simmons, who believes the worst words ever used are ""It's good"" (I think so). This is what I believe in too, mediocrity is not acceptable. Though he has questionable methods for making his point but he is not there to make fans but find the best. And you can also relate to him.These two characters are the spine of this movie, without their performance, this movie won't have worked as well. But the director, Damien Chazelle directs this well-written movie with an amazing style. From the movement of camera to amazing editing, this movie is masterpiece. I know it's not for everyone, but those who can relate, this movie is classic.Rating: 10
Meaning: Classic"
" I love J.K Simmons:
",2019-08-09 00:00:00,8,"Wiplash is a movie that was praised by critics, and i´m agree, is a very good movie,and the J.K Simmons performeance is amazing, J.K Simmons is one of my favorite actors.The movie is about a young drummer, maybe this could sound boring,but is not,something that i like very much is that the movie is very realistic to some extent,give you the message that without pain there is no gain,and that is 100 porcent true.The main character suffer ,and you don't realize,because the movie doesn't victimize the characters and that´s something good. It's very different movie than the ones I've seen, I loved this movie,but the problem is that the movie sometimes is a little exaggerated, like when Andrew is crashed by a car and even though this bleeding is going to touch the concert. Look i don´t have any trouble in which the movie has only two main characters, the problem is that they doesn't have much personality,we know that both like music and well thats it.In conclusion Whiplash it's an outstanding movie but it's not perfect"
" Movie Review Profits
",2019-08-03 00:00:00,9,Play Whiplash! It is fast and easy to view! A good way to spend your time. Be the best!
" Far from great.
",2019-07-26 00:00:00,7,"This film has been on my list forever and I finally got a chance to watch it. It works. Frankly, it is a little overrated and the ending plays out in a way to almost nullify the whole film but yeah, I can see why people hold it in such high regards but I don't."
" A perfect semplicity
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,9,"""Whiplash"" is an excellent movie, dense and captivating that is definitely worth watching. I want to start mentioning the superbe work from J.K. Simmons and Myles Teller because I feel they did great and surely the final movie wouldn't be so good without them. In general the entire cast was good but the movie is heavy centred around the two actors previously mentioned. But the real ""x-factor"" is Damien Chazelle who wrote a great screenplay and then thanks to an energetic and electric direction he involves the wathcers into this story. This is about the psychological fight between a drum student (Teller) and his professor (Simmons) and it isn't something intricated or difficult. Indeed is simple but it is executed so well, with a great characterisation of the protagonists, that this semplicity becomes a plus. And finally since this film is about music the score and the jazz songs present in the movie are really important and even in this aspect the quality is really high.
In conlusion ""Whiplash"" is the triumph of the careful semplicity, of the passion to telling small stories that speaks to the audiences."
" Utterly outstanding
",2019-07-20 00:00:00,9,"I've never actually written a movie review before but man this film just stands out so well.
music is a big part of my life and when my friend told me about this film I just had to sit down and watch it and it's just blown me away.
Everything about this movie is nothing short of perfection; the dialogue, the acting, the chemistry between the two main characters, the overall tone of the movie.
I won't go into the story because you honestly just need to watch it, its such an inspiring film for anyone who's ever thought of giving up or for anyone just chasing a dream.
Whiplash has been one of my favourite films this year that I've had the pleasure of discovering and you need to stop reading this and go and watch it because when it comes to the close of the movie you won't be able to look away and you'll walk away from this movie feeling something else entirely."
" Whistleblower
",2019-07-16 00:00:00,9,"In an age where anyone with an airplane loyalty card and a whistle calls themselves a popular musician, this movie is a necessity to safeguard the foundations of music.
There are two ways to the top, excellence or corruption. Whiplash talks about both with unmasked honesty. Whereas many gatekeepers to the stages of the world are corrupt, excellence must find a way to shine through. This way will be painful, as we watch the passionate jazz drummer student growing up in the class of a sadist and corrupt teacher. But the lesson is for reality and the result is a musician who truly knows his craft instead of defining his profession from applause.
It seems appropriate that this movie has won a Sundance prize. I deduct a star from the rating for one-dimensional characters."
" A wonderful film of musicisianship with an incredbily talented cast
",2019-07-16 00:00:00,9,A great showcase of skill and a wonderful storyline with great camera skills too!
" Phenomenal
",2019-07-11 00:00:00,10,"One of my favorite movies, all around great story and the acting was great."
" Beware of the final scene
",2019-07-06 00:00:00,6,"Yes the acting and story are good. The dynamic between student and teacher, interesting. Enjoyable film as many microcosmic films are--a glimpse into an insular, eclectic world. BUT.....the last scene of the movie stretches credulity too far. There is no way this could happen in a prestigious jazz setting. Yea, it gets the message across that the student finally finds his voice in defiance of his teacher who acknowledges it, but how? By letting the young music student take over the proceedings completely. Fun to watch but no setting such as this would ever see something like this happen. It was almost laughable. Can give this film a six but man, I'm a musician, a drummer, and no way could any musician swallow the crescendo of the music and the movie itself without forcing down a gag."
" Edge-Of-Your-Seat, Incredibly-Well-Acted Masterpiece in Filmmaking
",2019-07-06 00:00:00,10,"Very few films are jaw-dropping in the dramatic aspect, but when they're done right they're always fantastic, and this is one of those very few films of the last ten or so more years to capture the word masterpiece in every way. If acting performances and portrayal wasn't enough then there's phenomenal development, structure, narrative, directing, pacing, chemistry, dialogue, music and so much more. At its highest peak possible WHIPLASH succeeds in captivating the viewer while keeping you at the edge of your seat, and I mean this quite literally. The performance of a lifetime is seen by J.K. Simmons as the overly-harsh, frustrating, almost-antagonistic music conductor, Terence Fletcher. I don't think there are many character portrayals of the last decade which can live up to this one. There are very few. Prominent main star Miles Teller portrays first-year jazz student drummer, Andrew Neiman and also gives a very worthy and fantastic performance, pushing the boundaries of all things passionate, aspiring and ambition. The end performance, toward the end of the final act is absolutely soul-perplexing and bedazzles the viewer, I was totally blown away, I cannot stress enough how jaw-dropping and mesmerising this was. Absolutely transcending; definitely one of my favourite ending scenes to any movie. I HIGHLY recommend this to all movie-lovers, movie-goers, jazz enthusiasts, music aficionados and drama fanatics. 10/10, one of the very best movies of the last twenty five years!"
" Stunning!!
",2019-07-03 00:00:00,10,"It was an easy film for me to ""try"" as Simmons is continually an all time favourite of mine, in all his acting roles &/or styles but this film... Wow!! I was unable to take my eyes off the screen and unable to get the music out of my mind.I once heard some idiot say that ""Jazz is the last refuge of the untalented musician"". Obviously they were one of the fools who are unable to appreciate its joyous diversitys. 'Whiplash' has cemented my appreciation of both film and music, in particular Jazz. I am oh so glad I am mad about the lot.I loved 'Whiplash' for so many reasons. The drama, the suspense, the acting, the realism... The SHOCK!!!I really truly have PTSD (100%) and the most shocking and traumatic scene in the film was the most realistic scene of its type I have ever witnessed. I felt it as well as just saw and heard it. I won't ruin the scene for you.Just watch this magnificent musical film. I reviewed so quick it gave me Whiplash."
" In my all time Top 10.
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,10,Electrifying. Non-stop energy from the first scene to the last. A powerful film about true artistry and the sacrifices one must endure to achieve it. The final 30 mins are just sublime.
" A film you have to see!
",2019-06-28 00:00:00,10,"JK Simmons and Miles Teller performances in this amazed me the character development alone was so impressive. Such an underrated film that not many people have seen, this is a golden find for anyone that loves a good gripping film from start to finish."
" Whiplash: 2 Angry Men (Major Spoilers, Just Watch It)
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,8,"When it comes to opening shots, there has never been a better way to summarize an entire story or introduce one with something easy to take in. ""Whiplash"" is something that isn't easy to handle at first. The black screen is what we only see but the film's potential comes only through the sound of drums. It eventually becomes more faster and powerful and it suddenly puts us into discomfort of the intensity and the increase in speed of the violent slam of the drums. Our opening is rather showing a drummer practicing on the drums as the camera slowly moves towards him and he realizes that something was watching him. A medium shot of J.K. Simmons' character is standing there, listening to him. It is revealed that he has a rude personality and that Miles Teller's character is rather ashamed that he did not catch J.K.'s character's attention with his skills. It was at that point, the relationship between Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) and Andrew (Mile Teller) would begin. A story so violent and horrifying without expressing it through physical violence. This is what began ""Whiplash""""Whiplash"" is something that's scary and alienating to viewers. We are often to sympathize with our main character and stay close to them as we are taught to. Andrew is a character that isn't much to sympathize with. A man who's driven to insanity by his strong passion for being a legendary drummer along with Charlie Parker and Buddy Rich. To be honest, I didn't even see the sudden change from innocent to pure evil in Andrew. It is disturbing to see one man's passion killing the person itself. A dangerous level obsession. And this is all caused by Terence Fletcher, a man that has gone as far as making a trombone player cry in shame for being out of tune. Although, we do feel a little sympathy for him as it is revealed that his best musician or student in this case has died in a car crash. It was actually a time when he cried and a close personal shot was powerful enough for us to feel bad for him. Even if Andrew has to curse and insult his friends and get into a violent car crash and managed to be a few minutes late, Fletcher kicked him out of the group and Andrew's response came out with all that anger and stress being released with a powerful tackle and wrestling. Andrew's passion in being Fletcher's student is to the point his hands are bleeding from drumming injuries. It is also shown that Terence has been kicked out as a teacher and is now a jazz band musician that also is having a concert the next day. Even after being kicked out, Terence still pushes him down and still treats Andrew poorly. It is to this point, Andrew has learned a powerful lesson and it all happened with the song that nearly killed both of them, ""Caravan"". Andrew starts to slam with anger and passion as he tells the cello player to start playing the charts for ""Caravan"" and soon Fletcher decides to have the whole band to play, ""Caravan"". Pissed with Andrew, Andrew fights back as one of the cymbals hit Terence in the chin. A surprisingly satisfying moment for many people. And then, our finale ends with Terence and Andrew finally both having a common ground that they can both handle and Terence throws the final part of ""Caravan"" at him and Andrew drums his now again bruised hands rapidly as he the movie ends. It is never known if Andrew survives or not, but it is clearly known that Andrew became one of the world's greatest drummers of all time that night and it has been completed that night.A deep well-layered story that has several emotions and colors that makes up what ""Whiplash"" is now makes Whiplash a modern classic. Possibly the best film of 2014 for many people. A film that has never been more refreshing and more realistic than any other film. A film that talks about obsession and passion of an artist is something that isn't so common in modern cinema today. Only film to ever compare to ""Whiplash"" is Darren Aronofsky's ""Black Swan"". Haunting as the music, ""Whiplash"" is a must see for anyone, whether you hate little bits of blood or hate anxiety. A modern masterpiece.

" my notes
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,6,Pretty good movie. good acting. feeds my interest in music and makes me pay even more attention to the drummer in a band (1 viewing)
" Wow...I LOVED IT!
",2019-06-24 00:00:00,10,This movie is clearly a masterpiece. Dont pay attention to bad reviews.!!!
" Intense
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,10,"Whiplash is simply stunning. Its easy to see why the screenplay was blacklisted and the movie nominated for numerous awards. JK Simmons too is deserving of all awards after an intense performance. This movie is electrifying, emotional and is genuine edge of the seat stuff. Its a compact movie with a high quality level of drama, every moment captured is excellent. Miles Teller was superb in his draining role, his experience of ambition is dark and testing. The finale was strong and outwitted itself, so much so that Whiplash will endeavour to be one of my favourite movies of the year for its climatic spectacle of entertainment."
" Electrifying
",2019-06-16 00:00:00,9,We need just to step out from our confort zone.. Is that simple!
" Fantastic film with very few flaws
",2019-06-13 00:00:00,8,"It is difficult to find movie aiming to portray excellence in musicianship that hits the mark. Most disappoint visually, audibly, or on a weak plot. Whiplash does not.But lets be clear: although the plot is premised on musicianship it is actually about addiction. Our protagonist is the user, and our antagonist represents the drug. The script only fails this premise in two areas:First, the treatment of the the boyfriend/girlfriend relationship doesn't properly accentuate the user's desire to chase the drug above everything a user would otherwise treasure.And second, the last scene that Paul Reiser appears in leaves the audience unsure if he is amazed by a previously unseen/unknown talent or in horror after realising his son has once again fallen victim totemptation.Otherwise brilliant, and 'well played' Miles Teller.Sit back, relax and be prepared for a thrill ride."
" It Got Me To Thinking
",2019-06-12 00:00:00,8,"The movie is about a cruel perfectionist teacher in an exclusive school of music, and a pupil who has a need to become one of the best musicians (drummer) ever. Somewhere I have seen this plotline before but as I watched the movie, that sense of deja vu didn't too much matter. The performances were very good but the best part about it was that it got me to thinking. First, the student, played by Miles Teller, and the teacher, played by J.K. Simmons, were cut from the same cloth as far as the almost pathological need to create supreme talent. The student was free to walk away from the abuse at any time but he chose not to. For that reason my sympathy for the student disappeared well before the end of the film.I have known a number of people who sacrificed a lot in pursuit of a dream. I think specifically of long ago when I would see friends study hours on end, day after day in pursuit of one career or another. As a lifelong below average student with very limited academic aptitude and no artistic ability of any kind, I was never put in the position of those friends, or the fictional student in the movie. Whiplash made me wonder if I would have been willing to make such sacrifices, given the chance. Any film that spawns thought must be pretty decent."
" Fantastic
",2019-06-09 00:00:00,9,"Whiplash is a startlingly direct portrayal of determination. Wonderful score, cinematography and direction. Stellar acting from Simmons and Teller."
" A masterpiece. One of the best movies of the decade about music and quite entertaining
",2019-06-09 00:00:00,9,"Whiplash is one of the best films I have ever seen, it is a true masterpiece. I can't find a single flaw with the film. Teller is amazing and J.K Simmons is groundbreaking. It doesn't get much better than this. Props to Damien Chazelle"
" Whiplash - A Merciful Jazz Film
",2019-06-03 00:00:00,9,"In this psychological film about the rise of a new jazz drummer, the movie perfectly exhibits a dynamic between a wannabe jazz musician and the abusive music instructor. The clash between the two characters, Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller) as the drummer, and Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) as the instructor, demonstrates some of the finest acting I've ever seen. Each showing off an emotionally driven performance that captures the reality of their characters and beautifully displaying their strong beliefs on screen. Whiplash has nailed every aspect of a spectacular film.Set in New York City at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory, and based on real life experiences from director Damien Chazelle, we follow a young ambitious drummer whose looking to make it big with the studio band at Shaffer. He's discovered but is soon bullied by the bands director. Rage cursing and physically abusing, Fletcher is the harshest instructor Neyman has ever experienced but all because he ""pushed people beyond what's expected of them.""Developing a character is no obstacle to the director Chazelle. Terence fletcher is the epitome of a nightmare. Derived from a past teacher of the directors, Fletcher crosses the line multiple times with physical and verbal abuse. Throwing chairs, using extensive explicit language and driven by delusion, he believes his actions to be justified by the fact that he just wants the best out of a performance.The film is built on character development, tense interactions and beautiful musical demonstrations. We see much change in the main characters Neyman and Fletcher as they are pitted against each other for the majority of the film, motivated by their individual drive for greatness. Another major drive in Whiplash is its ability to create tense moments with the interactions between the two main characters. The cinematography is another side that carries this movie beyond expected. In many scenes, but the final performance to be specific, Chazelle demonstrates his incredible ability to capture live music and put it on to film to the deal most visually pleasing experience. The the the the th the the The the the theAlthough Damien Chazelle is popular among the musical movie world, Whiplash is a complete 180 turn from his last success La La Land. With a different pace and tone from the movie La la land, Whiplash was ""initially written out of frustration"" which is clearly applicable to why the characters act the way they do. No jokes, no gags, whiplash fills a serious dramatic role in Chazelle's collection of films. Chazelle has struck a note with his capacity to convey music and film seamlessly.The finale says it all. Whether you were satisfied with the ending or not, the final scene is the most impressive scene in my music history experience. Capturing amazing acting and great cinematography, Whiplash is not shy of a spectacular film."
" A Young Musician Vs His Teacher
",2019-06-03 00:00:00,9,"Whiplash is about a young jazz musician (Andrew Neiman) trying to become an elite drummer. A music teacher (Terence Fletcher) sees his skill and asks him to become a drummer for his band. He ends up joining however he quickly learns just how harsh and strict Fletcher's teaching methods are for his musicians. As Nieman plays Fletcher verbally assaults him for the mistake he makes. Although this initially get his down, over time, he develops a passion to pay well for Fletcher.
Initially the emotional stress Fletcher places on Nieman gets to him and it combusts when Fletcher says he didn't play well for a concert. He soon signs a lawsuit against Fletcher for the emotional damage that he has done to the home and as a result, Fletcher gets fired and Andrew quits drumming. Later on, they meet again and Fletcher asks him to rejoin his new band for a jazz festival where they are being judged. Andrew begins playing only to realize that Fletcher has given him a music piece that he doesn't know. He soon leaves the place humiliated but comes back to play ""Caravan,"" a piece he initially could not master under Fletcher, and cues the band. Fletcher is first confused but soon guides Andrew to end the song, and the movie, on a high note.
JK Simmons acting is some of the most stress-inducing acting you will ever see. The way he portrays Fletcher is very frightening to the viewer. He shows his anger well, with inflections, tension, and reactions to Andrews drumming. His acting is able to truly convey Fletcher's motives and his passion for jazz music and for perfectionism. There are many times in the movie I felt very uncomfortable through his acting. A scene that exemplifies his acting strength was when he angrily questioning whether Nieman was rushing or dragging during his drum playing. This scene is the main example of JK Simmons acting with anger and energy. While this movie has many strengths to it, JK Simmons paying the role of Fletcher has to be one of the biggest strengths of the movie.
While the acting in Whiplash was incredible, the main message from the film is something that I don't agree with. At the end of the movie, it felt that the way Andrew became skilled was by Fletcher pushing him to his emotional and physical limits. I don't believe that you should make anyone work to so hard that it makes them emotionally drained to the point of insanity. It's is very unlikely that success will come from pushing someone to their limits all the time. Similar to how in Full Metal Jacket Hartman pushes Pyle to commit suicide, Fletcher also does that with one of his fellow students. I feel like in the end this movie gives off the impression that it is good to push people to their emotional and physical limit as this will eventually lead to their success.
Whiplash is a fantastic movie for anyone. The way the conflict between Nieman and Fletcher is portrayed is one of the best back-and-forths that you will ever see. I love the music score, the directing, the visuals, and pretty much everything about this film. I believe that everyone should go out to watch it."
" I like the music instructor
",2019-06-01 00:00:00,8,"The music instructor's story looks hard, cruel and only thinks of his reputation on the other hand he is only a perfectionist in his field and I really enjoy his character as an audiophile he can determine quality music. it's not about how to teach who is too forced this is how totality in playing professional music. the other side of this film is very interesting to bring up messages among other families, other perceptions of society / someone who underestimates music that actually plays music is not easy and very proud because it requires consistency, dedication and very hard training."
" Masterpiece.
",2019-05-28 00:00:00,10,"The moment the credits rolled I knew I saw something special. Acting, direction, production is all perfect. Snappy, witty, sharp scenes filled with lush dialogue that gives significant meaning to all characters. This movie will make your jaw drop. Prepare to be wowed."
" Captivating & inspirational story of grasping your dreams with grit & grind
",2019-05-27 00:00:00,9,"What a movie. What an enchanting experience. In my review, I will focus on the philosophical and human perspectives.I didn't think I would enjoy it when I first saw the plot tagline, but it's about much more than drumming. It's a deep subtle movie about one mentor using crazy tactics to push his pupil to greatness. To me, it shows you need to fail in life before you succeed, and you need stubborn grittiness. You have to be extremely stubborn each time you fail and to triumph over each challenge you face in life. You might sweat, you might bleed, you might lose sleep, you might even lose some of your humanity in the process, but damn it give it everything you have. Figure out what drives you, inspire yourself, work at it, be passionate, believe in yourself when nobody else will, fight for your dreams because no one else will. Only you can take the bull by its' horns as the saying goes. You might stumble, you might fall but walk if you can't run, crawl if you can't walk, bleed if you must, sweat if you have to but damn it don't ever give up on your dream..As for the ideas in the movie, I want to focus on the music teacher's controversial approach and the philosophy behind his teachings..
I think the issue was he felt the ends always justified the means. He employed extreme measures to find and build greatness. He became an obsessed jerk to the point where he lost his own humanity to inspire another. You constantly see anger, passion, jealousy, rage, powerful emotions from a flawed human being. It was almost madness how far he went to fulfill that goal of building greatness.Was his intention right? I think so but his path and style were wrong. As we noticed, a former student of his killed himself because he felt he would never amount to much. As a teacher, you can't pressure your students to the point where it's either reach greatness or give up altogether. You have to inspire greatness rather than forcefully manufacture greatness if there is no desire to be had from the pupil. His approach was certainly not without significant flaws.What was his belief? Well, his world view, whether we liked it or not, was that greatness can only be built if you put your heart, mind and soul into some talent & push yourself to the absolute limit. Only by surpassing that limit can you reach the pinnacle of greatness. You should never stop 'there' but continue to push yourself beyond 'there'.He used a few examples - he mentioned Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker, couple elite musicians, etc. What if they had just stopped 'there' and not pushed themselves even further? They would still be good musicians, sure, but not all-time legends. It's all about not selling yourself short. Everything else in life, to him anyways, was superficial and simply something that must be tossed aside. I disagree with that but not entirely. He has a completely valid point - if you enjoy doing something and want to pursue that craft, don't just pursue it to be good. Pursue it to be GREAT! Don't ever accept mediocrity from yourself, and push yourself constantly to be even greater.My issue was with how he approached it. He was very much demeaning and dehumanizing. You could see his students bleeding and in severe pain at times. He didn't care and kept pushing them to the edge of sanity.Powerful movie once you reflect on it and the ideas it portrays. The music teacher was a jerk, but you can tell he had the right intentions. I was silent and shaking at the end when everything came together at once. Spectacular movie that I feel tells you more about yourself than the drummer. Did I mention it only had a $3 million budget?My rating: 9/10. Watch it!"
" Visceral and abrasive to the point of disbelief
",2019-05-11 00:00:00,7,"Following its critical acclaim, Whiplash was one of the films to see in 2014, a storied account of a promising orchestral drummer in over his head. On paper, this movie sounds like an excellent premise, non-conventional and darker than almost any other musically-oriented productions. However, the result didn't quite have the magic I was expecting; the aggression displayed by J.K. Simmons (who deservedly won numerous awards for his role) seemed misplaced given the nature of his job, and the film around him doesn't offer much else.Miles Teller (one of my least favourite actors working today) is well-suited for his leading role, balancing his character's fractured personality against his commitment to the music. It is also worth appreciating Teller's devotion to his performance, as he took 2-hour drum lessons 5 days a week for the 5 months prior to filming. Outside of Teller and Simmons, the rest of the film is just a foil to allow their chemistry to spark - constantly pushing against one another to see who will cave first. Their intentions, however, are not the same: Simmons has an element of pure hatred hard to capture on screen, further capturing the difficulty of his role.The camerawork is also strong, maximising darkened backgrounds and closeups to highlights the subtleties of each instrument's operations. Makeup is also used minimally but effectively, slowly building Teller's face up to emphasise the strain he undergoes for his job. Whiplash has a lot to like, but personally didn't grab me as the reviews suggested. If you can build the emotional connection with the leading roles, then Damien Chazelle's other directorial triumphs (First Man, La La Land) will also be worth your time."
" what a tension!
",2019-05-06 00:00:00,8,"All the way through the whole movie I felt so intense, my stomach was in knots. But the tension is one of the many great things this movie can offer. It's original and the performances are so good that they make the atmosphere kind of painful to watch but in the same time everything is just somehow inspirational. That's what surprised me the most. You see the tears, you see the blood. You see that madness for success. And you tell yourself ""That's crazy. He's sick."" but in the same time it motivates you to be better in the things you do, to follow your dreams even if it's hard. But then, maybe I will sound hypocritical, we have only one life and sometimes a person has to think about his priorities in life. I mean, do you really want to suffer and be humiliated for the award to be great? If you are ready to do that then that's okay. But if you don't want that that's okay too. That's what I get from the movie. I feel like Whiplash showed what it takes to be the best - how you have to sacrifice everything and be completely dedicated to your task, but in the same time it showed the ugly side too - how because of success you can't really enjoy anything else, how you limit yourself from so many great things. So with so much truth and amazing acting, I can't say anything else than that this movie deserves to be watched."
" Brilliant movie
",2019-05-06 00:00:00,10,"I think ""Whiplash"" is one of the best movies in 2014. After many stupid movies, Miles Teller showed his best side. It is clear that he worked on his character like Andrew on his drumming.
After watching movie I wanted to see all movies with J.K Simmons. I think he deserved the Oscar in 2014 for this movie. He so accurately showed a complex character. His mad look, smile, gait, his energy. The movie is full of endless tension, emotions and great music, it is incredible combination. I think ""Whiplash"" is masterpiece."
" Semi-Decent Drama Undermined by a False Understanding of Artistic Excellence
",2019-05-02 00:00:00,6,"Of course, it would be naive to read Whiplash as a simple endorsement of Terrence Fletcher's cutthroat, oppressive, and terroristic pedagogical methods (although many unfortunately see it as one). The film refrains from moralization, but instead aims to show the audience the price one supposedly has to pay to achieve artistic excellence. The film is telling us - this is what it takes to produce a great artist. By doing so, it sets up a neat and simple opposition - society's prevailing paradigm of gentle nurturing and guidance, and Fetcher's relentless and ruthless methods of pushing his students to their breaking point.But this opposition is based on a profoundly superficial understanding of what it means to be a great artist. That is to say, the great crime of this film is to reduce artistic excellence down to nothing more than technical perfection. It is then not surprising that it chooses drumming, the most ""athletic"" instrument, as its prime example.Great art is obviously more than technical perfection. Originality, sensibility, aesthetics, and intellectuality are all important measurements of artistic merit. But addressing these issues would complicate and diminish the film's rather simplistic message.Sure, Whiplash can be read as a morally ambiguous story of hard-work, overcoming self-complacency, and achieving excellence, but the very way in which the problem is proposed and framed betrays a thoroughly technicist understanding of art and aesthetics."
" Experience from usually not a fan of these kind of musical films
",2019-05-02 00:00:00,9,"I dont know anything about jazz or playing drums. I like thrillers and movies that give you different emotions. This movie was all about that. It should be marked as a ""thriller"" with all these twists haha"
" Clawing to the top with blood-stained drumsticks
",2019-04-30 00:00:00,9,"Tape your fingers now or else those nails will be bitten down to nubs when this is over. Equally unbearable and exhilarating, Whiplash turns the teacher-student relationship right on its head; far more Full Metal Jacket than anything inspirational. To that end, this is the best I've ever seen from J.K. Simmons, spewing venom as Miles Teller strains under his withering abuse. This is psychological thriller against the backdrop of jazz (a sentence I never thought I'd see myself typing), and Simmons is the emotional terrorist you just do not see coming. That goes for the whole movie, one that I've never seen anything like. There's a wealth to appreciate here, from the masterful editing and direction to the music, and the hype is absolutely warranted.And is it just me, or does ""Not my tempo"" belong up there with ""Is it safe"" as far as chilling lines go?"
" You agree or not!
",2019-04-29 00:00:00,10,"You agree or not with the teaching system they show but it is a must watch movie for all parents. The language is too strong for kids to watch.
Death Poet Society, and this movie is two of my favorite movies based on education."
" Loved it

",2019-04-09 00:00:00,6,"I really don't know why people insist that this movie was a fantastic movie!?yea that was a kind of good one!
but seriously!? is it that much good?! like suddenly the movie have ended and you can't even guess what the hell was that?!
this movie could be so much better and i still don't know what to say!"
" When a man it's pushed to his limits
",2019-04-08 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie. It's really rare that you watch a film were passion and commitment is at the forefront its hole play trough. I have never in my entire damn life met a more evil person on screen the J. K. Simmons performance as the musician Terrence Fletcher , he is so evil and psychopatic that you hate him more and more when it becomes very clearly that this man is the devil in human form. Miles Teller plays the young drummer Andrew Neiman that tries to become a professional musician and get Fletchers respect with his drum skills but it all goes crazy in and extremely sinister way with Fletcher psycho manipulation off the young drummer that is in a nightmare where he either have to fight back or be totally destroyed. It's a film that does everything right, pacing, plot twist, acting it got it all. And the ending is the best ending in any movie in 20 years. I just loves this movie. Breathtaking."
" Amazing story
",2019-04-03 00:00:00,9,"The progression if the story is amazing, the ending is *{%*^} mindblowing, love it all the way."
" Will be thrilled, especialy the musicians!
",2019-04-02 00:00:00,10,"Both first roles are very good. I believe the cast was carefully selected.
I like the photography and the colors left in my eyes.
I like also the turning camera technique in somes important scenes, instead of using two cameras, giving me the feeling I was on stage, and turning my head around.
Some criticize the teacher as overly sadistic. There are teacher like him.
He remind me my acting lesson teacher. She believed preparing should be torturus to death in order to have a perfect result.
I believe this movie will be especially interesting for the musicians. Will appriciate the technique, and might wake some of their memories."
" It turns orchestra performances into action scenes
",2019-04-02 00:00:00,10,"Whiplash written and directed by Damien Chazelle is a simple story told in such a captivating way. The amazing script keeps you engaged from start to finish. The dialogue is so sharp, that I couldn't wait to hear the next words to come out of the characters . Whiplash is one of the most exciting, nonstop dramas I've ever seen. The performances are incredible, with J.k Simmons winning the Oscar for best supporting actor. This film also received an Oscar for its editing, by Tom Cross. The editing in this movie is some of the best ever. At times it is so fast paced and exciting that it almost turns orchestra performances into action scenes. Seriously this movie is all about music and jazz, but the intensity, thrill and unpredictable nature, keeps you on edge the entire runtime. The music by Justin Hurwitz as well as a few other composers, really creates a fast paced jazz feel, as well as elevates moments of sadness and depression experienced by the main character. This movie shows that big budgets don't always mean great films. This movie relies on pure talent and great writing to keep the audience engaged, as opposed to explosions and CGI. Whiplash is one of my favourite movies of all time so there for I give it a 10."
" One of the greatest!
",2019-03-29 00:00:00,9,Amazing movie and characters. Recommend this 10/10
" Great film about resilience!
",2019-03-27 00:00:00,9,"Incredibly powerful message about never giving up, I loved this film!"
" From a drummer's point of view.
",2019-03-25 00:00:00,1,"Warning: If you are an actual professional drummer or musician for that matter, you'll probably think this is the dumbest movie you've ever seen. So unrealistic in so many ways."
" Major oscar snub here
",2019-03-09 00:00:00,10,"I was really hoping this movie had won the academy award for 2014's Best Motion Picture. But of course it didn't and instead lost to Birdman. I still haven't seen that film to this day. Whiplash was the only film in that category that I had actually watched.What made Whiplash so great and remarkable of a film it is, is everything that Andrew(Miles Teller) had to endure from such a harsh band teacher, or should I say more of a mentor to Andrew.I think it is safe to say that everything that Andrew had endured might have indeed been done intentionally by Terence Fletcher(J.K. Simmons). He is the one who redeemed Andrew, because he basically put him through such a harsh series of events. Terence broke Andrew down as a person and saw who he was, but didn't necessarily manipulate him. Terence became the ""Joe Jones"" of the story in the film.In the movie Andrew was faced with 2 different drummers who were equally as driven as him to succeed as the main player. And Andrew finally came on top only because fletcher knew that's what Andrew would've loved to hear, once Fletcher goes off on him in that scene before Andrew got in an accident, Andrew stopped playing for the orchestra and essentially had time to recuperate and stop exerting himself and stressing himself out on playing good enough. Then once he is given the opportunity to come back after confronting Fletcher at that bar, he basically set Andrew up by offering him to play for his new band after Fletcher got fired from the original orchestra. As we see later on Fletcher reveales to Andrew that he knows that Andrew told on him resulting in Fletchers departure from the original school. Once Andrew is told by Fletcher about how he knows, Fletcher attempts to humiliate Andrew by having the band play something that Andrew has no clue how to play on the drums. He gets discouraged and walks off stage and hugs his father as he is about leave. Then comes the epic finally in which he is truly about to redeem himself as he walks back on stage and starts playing Caravan, the song he had basically mastered early on. He cues in the rest of the band and Fletcher, and in that final scene Andrew truly shows his preservation and true hunger and passion for it, almost like the final performance in Black swan. That is what made this film undeniably a masterpiece."
" A movie that doesn't give answers, but puts up so many questions
",2019-03-06 00:00:00,9,"I hear one group of people talking about musical technicalities of this movie, and another talking about bulling. Well, I wouldn't put it in any boxes, but rather pay attention to incredible details.
I liked certain scenes very much, because even though they might show caricature image, they also give a picture of a modern world rush for a success. I felt like I watched a movie about every good university in the world or anybody who wants to be a real professional. It is not just about violence, or sadism, it is about the sacrifice for a perfection and loosing the passion.
The scene in a cafe where the main actor talks with its professor gives some interesting topics to think about. One of them is his wish to create an extraordinary artist, but where he also says how he never made one. It is about hypocriticism of the pedagogues who should help students to get better, instead of soothing them with that that they are good enough, when they can do much better. Actually, at the end he made one, but he destroyed many before him. Where is the border? What can mildness build? And what can roughness? How soft can and should we be, and how harsh, where is the border line? Does one work with some, and with some the other? With whom does which one work? Is the one who sacrificed everything and himself for a great purpose actually a genius? Does he suffer of a Stockholm syndrome? Who is his torturer, could it be himself? Did he do the good thing? Is his sadist teacher a good teacher? Why yes? Why no? What could he do different? What could he do better? There are so many questions, and so little answers. I think every one of us should search for his personal answers."
" the last ten minutes
",2019-03-03 00:00:00,9,"This is about a teen drum player and his coach at his music college. The guy is picked up as core player in the coach's jazz band, but he struggles with tough practice.
One word which describes this movie would be ""emotional"" I think. Overall, both the lead character and the coach tell their emotion clearly through words, facial expression or choice they make. Sometimes, it is aggressive, but it shows how they both are serious about playing jazz which makes me be moved. The part I love in this movie the most is the last ten minutes. In that scene, the lead character plays the drum solo and the coach conducts it. Although there is no dialogue, I think that it tells everything in the movie and I lobe the ending with this wonderful scene."
" Fantastic
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,10,This is one of the best films ever made jk simmons is breathtaking this movie is not a happy ending fletcher just takes over Andrew and maybe just like his father said Andrew might die old drunk and suicidal at 34 years old it's like Andrew doesn't care about drumming and fletcher might just end up taking control of his own life which is not good and fletcher is so evil and in the bar scene fletcher is being nice but then Andrew realises that he shouldn't trust him because he is a evil human being and the way jk Simmons plays this character just blows my mind he definitely daerved the Oscar. So overall incredible film and would recommend who loves movies about jazz but I would also recommended it to anyone who doesn't like jazz movies but movies with incredible acting.
" Masterpiece
",2019-02-22 00:00:00,9,"Man o man, this movie is INTENSE.First of all J.K Simmons gave a stellar performance. He is scary in this movie and I can imagine myself sitting in that class and getting scared. I can personally relate to this because my teacher was really scary while I was doing my matriculation. Even a slightest of mistake made him really mad and he was unforgiving.I was hooked from start to finish."
" Electrifying. Dangerous. Masterful.
",2019-02-21 00:00:00,10,"It's a riveting, thrilling film that gets away with an ending that's perhaps just a little too keen to cleanly resolve the jagged drama. But if you ever thought Glee or Fame would be better rendered as a one-on-one psycho-thriller, here's your film."
" One of the best films this decade
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,10,J.K. Simmons gives one of the best supporting actor performances ever. I really love this movie and it's tempo of going is quite my tempo. Chazelle is maybe my favorite young director working today. Miles Teller did good job ( worst thing you can say to someone according to Fletcher) as a young musician. Ending is magnificent.
" I don't like this devil mentor, and I don't like this kind of devil's struggle
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,7,"It's really inspiring, but unfortunately I don't like this devil mentor, and I don't like this kind of devil's struggle. This may be the choice of ordinary people."
" Nice
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,6,"Top-notch camera work and top-notch JK Simmons. Tension stays high throughout the whole movie, and many twists keep the story from being predictable. Execution is well above average.
While it's surley entertaining, I think Whiplash lacks some depth. When the credits roll, you will find out that the story arc is very linear, and there's no enlightenment in it. At the and of day, this story is about grit and endurance, and nothing else. 6.5/10."
" Highly Entertaining
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,8,"I haven't read all 1000 reviews, but of those I have read not one of them mentioned the soundtrack for this engrossing film.That's a pity because I think the music holds a key part in the story. I didn't catch from the credits who was playing all the band pieces but they were a top notch band. I would have liked to have heard a couple more charts from them. However, I am a rehabilitated trombonist and it's been years since I played, but it was clear to me that the close ups were of people who weren't actually playing the music that was on the soundtrack. But you know what? I was willing to suspend my disbelief because the story was so gripping.J. K. Simmons was absolutely a terror, and I would love to see him try to sell State Farm insurance in character as Terence Fletcher. Just kidding! While Fletcher was an extreme caricature of a driven perfectionist, I had a band teacher in junior high who would throw small objects and yell at players he thought were lazy or not concentrating. I bought Fletcher's behavior, and I don't know how many of his stories about Bird were true, but I do know that Parker (and Miles and other greats) practiced their instruments for hours a day, every day. One of my favorites, Don Lanphere, was still practicing his scales two hours a day into his 70's, so Fletcher's message about what it takes to achieve greatness wasn't that far off track.I think most people, even experienced musicians, will be enthralled by this movie because of the performances of the main actors, the story, the interaction between characters (I felt Andrew and his father's relationship - played by Paul Reiser - was touching) and the tremendous soundtrack.While Fletcher's methods could be (and were) questionable, his objective was not and most people, including me, have no idea what it really takes to be one of the greats. Prodigies like Mozart are so very rare, that nearly all greats got where they are by embellishing some natural talent through dedicated and disciplined hard work. This move portrays that in a thoroughly entertaining and sometimes shocking way.Highly Recommended."
" Mr. Fletcher is a BULLY
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,5,"Although JK Simmons performance it's gold, In my opinion he was not teaching nor inspiring his students; in the contrary he was intimidating them, BULLY them. I finished watching the movie not just because I am a Mole's fan, but because I was expecting a twist in the story"
" A Psychological Horror Story
",2019-02-16 00:00:00,7,"In New York, a young jazz drummer (Miles Teller) is enrolled in a prestigious music school. His ambitions are tested and manipulated by a sadistic, perfectionist music instructor (J.K. Simmons).There are occasional moments in the film that seem far-fetched and over-the-top. But these are forgiven due to the edgy execution by director-writer Damien Chazelle and the acting.Teller is very believable as someone whose obsession to succeed overrides his sense of safety. This is partly explained in a useful scene at the beginning of an extended family gathering where one-upmanship seemed to be the traditional form of communicating.However, the movie belongs to Simmons who is the epitome of the authority-from-hell. He has rightly won many awards for this performance and he is likely to win more. He is so frightening when he is dominating the students that, even in the audience, there is a sigh of relief felt when he is acting more at-ease and human. His presence is that strong.""Whiplash"" ably presents the question of whether attaining genius is worth the price - at least in certain circumstances. It also succeeds as a psychological horror movie. The Simmons character is likely to be mentioned in the future as one of the movies' most memorable villains. - dbamateurcritic"
" I feel sorry for the those who thought they were watching a movie about music
",2019-02-15 00:00:00,10,"This IS NOT A MOVIE ABOUT JAZZ. it is a story of emotion and those emotions are not necessarily your emotions. Grow a bit. Listen. Watch. If you do you will enjoy, cringe, wonder and more. But stop with the music references. They were the vehicle to tell a richer tale."
" My all time favorite movie
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,10,It is a great movie for any fan of music or any type of art. Every major character in the film is very fleshed out and developed even in the film's short run time. I couldn't pick out a real flaw in the film if I tried. My one tiny complaint is how much swearing there is but that is just a personal complaint.
" Intense movie, phenomenal J.K. Simmons but unrealistic
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,7,"This movie should please a wide audience of non-musicians. I am not a musician but I've seen movies based on things I know very well and it's always exaggerated and unrealistic and it usually bugs me more than other people; I can easily imagine how real musicians may dislike this one.
The directing and acting are great (although J.K. Simmons steals the whole show) as are cinematography and sound. However the whole premise is wildly unrealistic, and the moral of the story ""to be great you need to be pushed beyond your limits"" is a tired trope that has often been done in a better way than here.
On a personal note, I hate bullies with a passion and there can never be a ""but it's for a good reason"" excuse for bullying."
" Good!
",2019-02-09 00:00:00,8,"This movie is very good to inspire people for never give up.
J.K. Simmons was great."
" Tension through out the whole plot.
",2019-02-07 00:00:00,10,"The idea that the movie offers of always being able to become better even when we think we have reached a certain high that we think we can't surpass is priceless, the way the plot is put, just leaves your hands sweating at the end of the movie, there isn't any con man in this movie, but we are forced to believe there is until the plot twists and shows us what an incredible person can do when taken to extreme places and not giving up when put to the test by a demanding believer."
" As an amateur musician...
",2019-02-05 00:00:00,6,"As an amateur musician, I really couldn't enjoy this. It is not really about jazz, let alone music. It's a movie about an abusive teacher and an obsessively self-destructive student, that uses the world of jazz music as a contrivance. Because so few people are familiar with the world of music, let along jazz, the movie is able to use this contrivance to create drama by divorcing itself from any kind of reality, under the pretence of insight.This wasn't a music movie, it's a sports movie (ht Adam Neely). It takes the tired sports formula, and substitutes football for jazz, with such a low level of realism the average person would be able to spot its absurdity from a mile away. It's terribly cringy, if not downright absurd. I doubt many people would rave about a movie about an abusive coach and a football player (who is obsessed with a very old deceased football player) on a team where no-one really loves football, no-one talks about football, and no-one care about their team-mates, and no parent cares if the coach is abusing their kids, etc. But substitute football for jazz, and apparently, this movie is critically acclaimed? Why? There are far better films about abuse, education, obsession. But I guess there are very few films about jazz, and so this imposter seems insightful to some. Trust me. Its not. This is depraved absurdist fantasy.Why 6/10? Because it is stylish. Well enough structured. It has one good music scene. And it seems to connect with audiences. So who am I to judge? :)"
" Brutal movie about ambition and tenacity
",2019-02-02 00:00:00,9,"This movie hits you like a truck, impressive and memorable!
I didn't read reviews nor read the plot outline of 'Whiplash' before watching and got heavily surprised. Telling from the cover I expected some warmwashed Documentary about music which got it's Awards for pictures and music or something, but oh boy I was wrong.
I think they could've made it even more dramatic for a 10/10, but I'll take it like it is and it's still a great movie."
" Intense
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,10,"I love this film, J.K. Simmons acting is one of the best, if not THE BEST. Very intense, very thrilling. Simply a masterpiece"
" A meaningful movie
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,10,"Beautiful visuals and a very strong message! Kept me on the edge of my seat... Gives a lot of food for thought, especially for people who work in the creative industry.Definitely one of my new favourites!"
" Amazing Film
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,9,"I love the concept and story about a struggling artist working with a extremely demanding and strict mentor. The acting by J.K Simmons and Miles Teller is fantastic and they really capture the directorial work of Damien Chazecle to a T. The jazz soundtrack is also a great component to the film, and sounded so beautiful. Powerful ending as well."
" Maybe I don't get it
",2019-01-22 00:00:00,3,"Maybe I'm missing something here, but this movie seems to be promoting abuse as a method to achieve perfection. It is incredibly painful to watch..."
" An Intense Masterpiece.

AVOID AT ALL COST !!"
" Breath-taking

" Good but over rated
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,7,"First hour is average for a film, the last half and hour or so is above average but I think people over rated the film a little too much. Don't get me wrong it's a good watch but the first hour can seem slow and repetitive. If your watching this thinking its going to be as action packed or suspenseful as a action movie your wrong. There still is some good suspense but not as much as people make out."
" Miles Davis would have hated this movie
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,2,"This movie is, as every one of the actual musicians here has noted, completely devoid of the reality, and, more importantly, of the JOY, of being a musician. The teacher's ludicrous verbal abuse, which fluctuates between politically incorrect and downright cruel, is so unrealistic and anachronistic in a portrayal of 21st-century educational life that I found it unwatchable. Simmons' character slaps a student repeatedly across the face, with no one gasping or saying a word about it, which had me rolling my eyes, it was like they were saying 1950s movie dialogue about how ""dames"" are dumb and can't drive, or something. I was offended, but I also kind of felt sorry for all involved, it was so... dumb.Beyond insulting my sensibilities as a human, it also insulted me as a musician, an artist. No credible teacher of art or music would think such negative extremes produce genius or even fine musicians. Discipline is crucial to becoming great, but so is flow, listening, and the creativity the truly exceptional experience when ""in the zone"" playing music with other people. This film gives zero sense of why anyone would actually want to become ""Charlie Parker"", I mean, does that mean famous? Parker was an innovator, a physicist of sound, not just some automaton who could play a million notes as fast as possible. It's like this movie was made by people who absolutely don't get why Coltrane makes you feel like you're inside the moon and why a Duke Ellington tune can float you away on the river of your own blood flowing in your veins. Miles Davis was famous for being able to encourage his bands to elevate their playing, I heard Herbie Hancock say that one time when he was blocked on a part Davis just listened and calmly said, ""put a B in the bass"". And everything flowed. No screaming, throwing, åsshølery, but something more masterful: a finely-tuned artist committed to creating greatness, communicating via his mastery of the mysterious, infinite language of music and a deep respect for the people helping him create it.A wasted opportunity to speak to the madness of wanting to be great, to achieve, and also a waste of the dynamic and always fun to watch J.K. Simmons, Watch him in his series Counterpart instead, in a part that displays all his swagger but also the sweetness and humour he mixes in so well."
" An electrifying breakthrough for Damien Chazelle
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,9,"Damien Chazelle has become a notable rising star in film direction in the past decade; his 2016 musical, La La Land was the subject of the infamous Best Picture mess-up at the 89th Oscars. Despite this, after a Best Director win, Chazelle has been tipped as a great and one of his films that demonstrates this perfectly is his 2014 breakthrough, Whiplash, the story of an ambitious young student under the tutorage of an abusive music instructor. Chazelle has crafted an exhilarating and detailed film, owing less to a La La Land-esque musical but rather to sports movies, like Rocky. Miles Teller stars as Andrew, a young and hugely ambitious drum protégé desperate to impress his notorious instructor, Terence Fletcher. J.K Simmons stars as Fletcher and is certainly the star of the film; his muscular physique and sharp tongue create a monster, yet one who remains human enough to remain terrifyingly believable. Slowly, we see the film turn into a game of cat and mouse as Andrew is relentless in his pursuit to impress Fletcher, who argues that tough love is the only way to breed musicians that make history. Whiplash is brutal when it needs to be, Tom Cross' editing adding a sharp execution (often cutting to the central drum kit) to Chazelle's attentive direction. The film is unforgiving in its pace, managing to turn even the most permissive drum solos into gripping dramatic set pieces. Even as the film descends into melodrama, plot-wise (literal car crashes begin to overtake the metaphorical), Whiplash never loses that golden forcefulness and intensity that makes it work so well. For a film about music, Justin Hurwitz provides a fitting score, his striking, bouncy music immersed within the jazz standards. The score feels like the film itself; brassy and pacy, yet somehow relaxed and perfectly measured at the same time.
Whiplash is a fine film; Chazelle's aptitude for detailed and thoughtful direction is clear and, even when the story trails into the unbelievable, you can't bring your eyes way. Simmons is stellar in his performance, his delicious brutality making him well deserving of his Oscar. Whilst La La Land shows Chazelle paying homage to the bygone movie musical, its predecessor is a very different film; nail-biting and uncompromising, Whiplash is a very accomplished piece of filmmaking"
" One Of My Fast Favorites!
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,9,"This movie easily became one of my fast favorites. Kept me on the edge of my seat wanting to see just how far the main characters would go. I'm also a lover of jazz, so the music didn't hurt as well!"
" Great Film
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,10,"This movie was perfect. If you are a musician, this will scare you half to death. I almost didn't want to finish it because J.K Simmons' insane acting literally frightened me. Being a musician myself, I don't really want a teacher like that. Overall, it was a great movie and defiantly earned its 3 Oscars.
10/10"
" (A) 96% *OUTSTANDING*
",2018-12-20 00:00:00,9,"An expertly directed film by Damien Chazelle, who gives us an emotional thrill ride about a jazz student (Miles Teller) who is willing to risk his life just to become one of the bests and an aggressive, demanding jazz teacher (JK Simmons) who is willing to push the boy to his very limits to make him become the best.
Every aspect of film-making is off stellar quality and JK Simmons steals the show with the performance of his life. Do not miss this movie.
Next review will be about the mind-bending masterpiece, perfectly orchestrated by the highly talented and respected Christopher Nolan."
" Wowwww
",2018-12-18 00:00:00,9,"This is so... Incredible. I, myself, am a musician and I get what Andrew feels, omg... He's someone with life goals and wants them to become true, no matter what. He's hardworking, he does everything in order to reach his aims... I can't decide if the ending is perfect or stupid but I guess it's just amazing ahaha great film"

" The movie that I always wanted to see
",2018-12-10 00:00:00,10,"A perfect movie. Strong, hard, immersive, good rhythm, good technique, perfect script, amazing acting."
" Mastapiece
",2018-12-10 00:00:00,10,"Visuals: Nothing fantastic, but didn't have to be. It was sufficient and didnt negatively affect it at all. Some on stage shots look pretty good especially at the end in the third act. There's use of slowmo during some of the drumming scenes and it's to good effect. Seeing the blood vibrating on the drum face in slow motion really helps echo the perfection that Simmons character expects.Audio: Music in the movie is fantastic. The only music you'll here is music being played by the characters and it definitely helps the movie. The main two songs the movie revolves around don't get boring even after hearing them multiple times. The mixing was actually realistic, and it sounded like actually being on stage every time it cut to a behind the shoulder shot of Tellers character. The car crash scene was particularly good. The whole scene after he gets in the crash, you hear the ringing like he does and it doesn't stop until the music starts going and Teller eventually fails. Small stuff like that really elevated it.Plot: Movie is legitimately intriguing. Main character feels like he has something to prove (although it seems a little cliche at the family dinner scene). Social commentary was very shallow, but it didn't need to be anything special. Should be the benchmark for how to end a movie. Perfect resolution and doesn't need anything more or less. The main drive of the main character is to be the best, and J.K. Simmons tells him how this can be done. Then he does it, simple as that. He didn't need a happy ending with his family, or his girlfriend. He just did what he did for himself. The whole folder scene never gets resolved and we don't know how it disappears. It literally vanished in the time it took Miles teller to put two quarters in a soda machine and grab the drink. They never resolve it and it's only there to push the plot. A lot of people view this as a negative, but I think it adds to the experience. Not knowing who took it allows you to theorize who did and their motivations for doing so. Simmons character is he best if these because he's trying to see if Tellers character is legit. What might have just been an oversight turned into one of the best scenes in the movie for me.Characters: J.K. Simmons is the best part of this movie. Every time he walks into a room or a scene,you know it's gonna be good. That's not to say the other performances weren't good. Miles Teller does pretty well too and does a good job in the final scene with the emotion he showed. Also he's a real good drummer for just learning for the movie.Notes: Cannot stress how good J.K Simmons is in this enough. Seriously one of the best performances in the last 20 years.++Performances (J.K Simmons)

Movies like this reminds me why I watch movies!!! The way the main characters play off one of another from the very beginning is something to look out for, this is very seldom done and doesn't always work well. However, it works here and I loved the fact that the character development was not too much, but just enough for us to have fallen in and out of love with both the antagonist and the protagonist. 8 stars!!"

" No, it is never OK.
",2018-12-07 00:00:00,1,"In this film, a music teacher drives a young man to commit suicide (but that's OK because he was fat and talentless). This same teacher is later vindicated - a few moments before they roll credits - because his violent approach to education has finally enabled a great musician to shine......so it was all worth it. One (non-fatal) car crash, one suicide. One student quit playing drums. Worth it... because ""a great"" was born. And isn't that how ALL great musicians are born? Oh, obviously. Could you ever become a talented person WITHOUT a violent maniac ""sacrificing his own humanity to push you to your limits"" (copied from 10 star review)? Obviously not.Or maybe... just maybe... Whiplash is based on a lie which is tempting to believe: that ""greatness doesn't come easy"" so you have to be ""cruel to be kind"". Is it all right to buy into this cliché nonsense just because a film is shot beautifully? Nope. Because the music is exceptional (and it is)? Still, no. It isn't. A young man commit suicide because of a teacher who ignored his duty of care. This really happens. Real people die. No, it is never OK.Whiplash shamefully missed the point. Film awards come cheap nowadays but good teaching skills are hard won. Any idiot can scream and shout. Terrence Fletcher was just a rookie teacher who liked jazz music but failed practically every student who ever came his way. And he failed Andrew, too. In many countries, people like Fletcher do not simply lose their jobs. They go to prison. Which is a good thing. A really really good thing."

",2018-12-06 00:00:00,4,"Whiplash is a messed up film, though not dull.I like the style of film in dealing with its subject matter, but I don't see how anyone could love it. A lot like ""The Competition"" with Richard Dreyfuss, though not good. The characters are complete a-holes, the fact that people could act this way with impunity's ridiculous. For Fletcher to get Andrew to be the drummer in the performance at the end makes no sense, as it would reflect poorly on him and there would be life altering repercussions if it didn't work out like it did. Then for Andrew to get up and come back, you'd have to be dragged away to let Fletcher get away with it. The audacity of Andrew to ask the girl out knowing he's a complete a-hole, to then break it off after putting her in that position, to then have the gall to call her later to ask her to go to his performance. How the hell can anyone write this crap? Serial killers have been nicer than this."

" One of the best written films I've ever seen
",2018-11-30 00:00:00,10,"In this magnificent piece, you will find - amazing acting, an outstanding score, intriguing visuals and dialogue created by the gods! Damine Chazelle is one of the most underrated directors of our time, I never hear any news about him (except for La La land), but his work has been lying in the shadows. This film proved J.K. Simmons amazing acting capability, as he performed his heart out as the antagonist of the story, yet at the same time pushing the protagonist to greatness via madness. Miles Teller's performance was very realistic and extremely emotional, his near madness in the second act of the film is extremely convincing and not out of character. Now the supporting cast was great as well and no subplot felt out of place. This film is perfect example for any writer wishing to make a dynamic character arc work in their work because Andrews arc is better than any I've seen before. The character change from the start of the film to the end of it feeling completely natural, yet extremely his personality is completely different. If you've seen the film or not, you should go watch it, or honestly any Chazelle movie, they're amazing."
" An excellent movie
",2018-11-29 00:00:00,10,"107 minutes of endless tension and flurry. I watched this at 3 am and there was not even 1 minute when I felt drowsiness. Whiplash shows how to keep attention, drama comes when it has to, and, of course, J. K. Simmons' play was extraordinary."
" Oscars for a Reason
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,10,"Whiplash won 3 Oscars for a reason; which is exactly why it's my all-time favorite movie. Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons are the only actors who could have orchestrated this masterpiece. Make no mistake, nothing really happens plot wise in Whiplash. The whole story is Andrew being broken down by Fletcher until they realize they're both the key to the other persons' success. But there's really not a concrete beginning, middle, and end. The last scene is the most epic moment in film history, and should be watched 100 times, but then the movie just ends. I make everyone watch Whiplash with me just so I can see their face when Fletcher does something terrible to a student. Absolutely incredible. Everyone who is strong enough, needs a Fletcher in their life. Go watch Whiplash now."
" Just one goal in mind!
",2018-11-26 00:00:00,9,"It's all about one goal, one dream, and the capability to achieve it all.The protagonist here Andrew Neiman, a 19 year old dreaming of becoming a great drummer. Not just becoming a great drummer, he wanted to get selected for Lincoln center. So he works hard for it. Very hard.But his teacher Terrence Fletcher never appreciates his hard work, and he is never satisfied. He's almost bullying Neiman mentally , and pushes him to exceed his limits. His ruthless teaching techniques takes Neiman to a whole other level. Andrew's goal was just to become a great drummer and get selected to Lincoln center but it eventually turns into an obsession due to Fletcher's abusing ruthless nature towards him. Fletcher pushes him and pushes him to the point he can take no more. Neiman tries his best to overcome all of these challenges...
To see what happens afterwards, you definitely need to see the movie...This is one of the most poweful movies I've ever seen my whole life.
And it is very very motivational.
I highly recommend this movie to anyone with a goal, a dream, and looking for some motivation!!"

" Delusional director is the real ""star"" of this film
",2018-11-21 00:00:00,4,"Writer and director Damien Chazelle says he based ""Whiplash"" on his real life experience. He struggled to become a jazz drummer while at Princeton (NJ) High School in the early 2000s. And, he had an intimidating teacher upon whom he based the character of Terence Fletcher in this film.But, his own awareness about his talent was different than that of his lead character in the film. Miles Teller plays Andrew who has a sense of his exceptional natural talent, which Chazelle says he did not have himself. Thus, the writer-director changed his pursuit to filmmaking. This is something to ponder in view of Andrew's outcome in the film, and the suicide of an earlier ""star"" student of Fletcher in the movie.Near the film's end, Fletcher says that he pushed those students he thought could be great. So, to him, that justifies his erratic, violent, and abusive behavior. Still, he knows he was fired for his behavior. The film doesn't probe that any further and just leaves it at that.Yet, everything the audience sees and learns about Fletcher says that he is delusional. He's living a lie. The one person whom he claims achieved greatness committed suicide. And, Fletcher lied about that, saying the former student had been killed in a car accident. His treatment wasn't just erratic with those he may have thought were special. He behaved crudely and angrily with everyone - all of the students in his band. The film clearly shows that everyone feared him.So, the conclusion that he was just pushing to bring out the greatness of a master musician doesn't ring true. His latest great talent, Andrew, gave up and quit playing the drums. As the counselor properly advised Andrew and his father, Fletcher was a harmful person who should not be teaching. Indeed, in what public or private school in America would such a bizarre character have been tolerated for so long?One suspects that Chazelle exaggerated the character some - if not a lot. And that's okay for writers and producers who want to have a dramatic effect and make a big splash. Would this movie have received half the attention it has if Fletcher had been anything near a normal person? I suspect many in the audience might have been bored, and most wouldn't even have weighed in by rating the film.Chazelle's Fletcher commands every moment he's on the screen. All one sees in the members of the band is fear. They don't even look up at him - their faces mostly to the ground, their eyes on the music. Beyond that, there isn't much depth of this story. There are many musical rehearsals and stops, and fits of rage with vulgar and abusive outbursts. These are punctuated at times by some short calm scenes of Andrew with his dad or with his girlfriend, Nicole.If anything, ""Whiplash"" seems to cater to the modern phenomena of movie mayhem - constant action, lots of violence, lots of noise and spectacle. Oh, yes, and real crudity. As with so many others, this film has little acting and not much of a story.Did J.K. Simmons deserve the Oscar for best supporting actor? He played the crude, angry, unbalanced tyrant of a teacher very well. How much talent does it take for anyone to vent and spew anger and vitriol? Then, again, there wasn't much competition among actors and roles nominated for 2014. But Simmons and his role as Fletcher surely hold the Oscar record for use of the most foul language, and number of expletives. Apparently, there were about 150 uses of crass language and swearing, and Simmons's Fletcher spewed at least 90 percent of them.And that reflects as well on the writing. The movie didn't win an Oscar for best screenplay or adaption, but it's a sad state of entertainment and Hollywood that it was even nominated. There's very little entertainment in this film, but it is an expose of a mentally disturbed tyrannical teacher and how he affects his students. ""Whiplash"" was more of a film about that character than about the star pupil, Andrew.An early scene has a poignant clue of what might lie ahead in the movie. A sign in large letters is posted on a band room wall. It reads, ""If you don't have ability, you wind up playing in a rock band."""
" A must see with strong character performances
",2018-11-21 00:00:00,9,"I went in this movie thinking it would be a 'feel good' movie about a young drummer getting to make a career. This movie does tell that story, but there is not much to feel good about after the credits roll..The movie is about Andrew Neimann (Miles Teller), a promising student on the drums at Shaffer Conservatory of Music, who wants to be as good as legendary drummer Buddy Rich. Andrew is currently drumming in one of the school bands but he wants to get a place in the schools studio band that is conducted by the most respected professor of the school: Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). One day Fletcher suddenly storms in the room where Andrew is practicing with the band and after listening to (and insulting) each student briefly, he invites Andrew to come to his class. Andrew starts as an assistant drummer and quickly learns that Fletcher transforms into a drill sergeant from hell when conducting and the whole band is trembling in fear when he accuses one of the players being out of tune. However, when the band takes a break Fletcher does strike up a friendly conversation with Andrew talking about his family and gives him a chance to be core drummer. Andrew is made temporary core drummer after the break but when he struggles to keep up the tempo of the song ""Whiplash"", Flitcher hurls a chair at him, slaps him in the face and throws the details of his personal life back in his face as insults. Despite this abuse, Andrew still wants to be the best drummer of all time but will the ridiculous high standards and physical abuse of Fletcher be to much for him to handle?This movie was exceptional since it tells a story we all have seen before (promising student climbing to the top) but without the typical feel good element usually found in these movies. Fletcher is an absolutely dis-likable figure who believes his harsh way of teaching is justified because it's the only way to find the next great jazz musician. That he destroys many good students careers (or even lives) in the process does not concern him at all, he cares only about meeting his ridiculous high standards. I felt sorry for Andrew in the beginning, he tries really hard, but Fletcher keeps pushing him further and further that I was hoping he would simply find another teacher. But he keeps destroying his own life, sacrificing everything to meet Fletchers demands and turn into a huge jerk who is so full of himself that he alienates everybody around him, including his other band members and his family.The greatest thing about this movie is the exceptional great acting from J.K. Simons and Miles Teller. Simons plays an angry Fletcher so well that i felt uneasy myself when he is getting mad at Andrew because he plays 'out of tempo'. Teller also plays a great role, starting as a likable student and turning into a jerk with delusions of grandeur. And while I don't listen to Jazz, the music used in the music was really great. The only 'problem' of the movie was that after the first act, there were no likable characters! This made it both interesting and hard to watch, and kept me hoping for a happy end... It's hard to talk about the ending without spoiling but I will say that it can be viewed both as happy and not so happy. (if that does make any sense..)Definitely a must see if you like movies with strong character performances and stories about people developing from student to ""greatness""."
" A Powerhouse of Music and Cinema Perfection
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,10,"There are not enough good things that I can say about this movie. Everything from the technical aspects to the acting to the story and pacing are all top notch. The performances from the actors especially are all fantastic specifically J.K. Simmons of course, as well as Miles Teller. Both give very convincing performances and deliver all of their lines perfectly. This is a very interesting movie in terms of tone and genre. I say that because while at first the movie presents itself as a heavy drama about the desire of fame by a young drummer, it quickly evolves into something unexpected yet also greater than the drama, which is a thriller. And of course I do not use the word thriller as it is generically applied to movies such as mysteries or action movies. Here it is genuinely thrilling because of the interplay between Fletcher (Simmons) and Andrew (Teller). As the movie progresses, Andrew's mental state is seen deteriorating as he starts to let his entire life be consumed by his drive to become the best drummer he can be. And along with this mental deterioration comes some of the most intense dialogue exchanges between Andrew and Fletcher that are easily some of the best scenes I have ever seen in a movie, period. Oh, and it helps that the cinematography is great as well. Every single shot in the movie is placed perfectly and close up shots are used very well here to establish thrilling moments and keep the audience (myself included) on the edge of their seats. It was definitely a wonderful movie to look at, the band scenes obviously being the standout ones. And on top of all these great things comes possibly the best quality of them all, and that is the music. Good lord, this movie has one of, if not the best soundtrack for a movie I have ever heard. It works so well and the choreography is so damn good that you genuinely believe that it is Miles Teller playing the drums and not the soundtrack. Every single one of the songs is crafted well and only adds to the layer of thrill that this movie has to offer. And in what may very well be one of the best endings in cinematic history, Andrew goes all out and gives an audience pleasing, amazing, applause worthy drum solo to finish of this perfect movie, well, perfectly. Everything about this movie blew me away, definitely one of the best films from the past decade, maybe even of all time. Go see this movie if you haven't, for the love of God, you will not be disappointed."
" On the thorns until the end
",2018-11-13 00:00:00,9,"An excellent movie, which maintains a constant level of anxiety, never banal, absolutely worth seeing.
Perhaps not to be reviewed as much of the effect of anxiety is based on the surprises that the main character reserves about the behavior that will be held in the minutes to follow.
Surprising J.K. Simmons, annoying until the end ... but this is it!* seen october 2018"
" Just not realistic
",2018-11-12 00:00:00,6,"So much potential here. Great acting, great music, terrible script. The behavior of JK Simmon's character is just so unbelievable that it nearly ruins the rest of the movie, however the acting and some good music saves it so at least it's entertaining, at least if you like jazz.This isn't Full Metal Jacket, and Simmon's isn't a platoon sergeant ready to lead his troops into battle. He's a freakin' music director.What's really sad is that they really could have made a GREAT movie here. A mentor pushing his students, a family dynamic that fawns over the quarterback of the family rather than the musician who at his age is nearly top of his game, yet unnoticed.But no, we have a psychotic music director who everyone seems to put up with, nary with a complaint. Just the way it is, I guess. lol.Then we get to the final competition, and the kid forgets his drum sticks... as if there isn't any other drum sticks in the hall, then he gets into a car wreck, sideswiped by a mack truck, and he stumbles away to still try to play. Just ridiculous."

" A Powerfully Memorable Film
",2018-11-10 00:00:00,9,"It's hard for me to stop thinking about ""Whiplash,"" a stunning independent film ostensibly about a young drummer, but really about unyielding ambition and passion. Miles Teller plays a music student pushed to his limits by a sadistic coach, played by J.K Simmons. It's a film in which Teller and Simmons support each other with shared intensity and tension. That tension becomes the uncredited leading character, which in turn grips the audience through every minute. This tiny film builds and builds, then slides back and blows up with a final frenzied conflict in which both characters connect in shared achievement. Whiplash was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, and J.K Simmons scored a a win for Best Supporting Actor, although his heel character was probably the easier one to bring to life. Teller shines too, just a bit more quietly, yet the film would have failed with any other actors in the lead roles. Ya gotta see this one."
" Portrait Of A Sadist As An Old Man
",2018-11-05 00:00:00,5,"This movie was built upon the myth of an abusive encounter that led to the creation of a supreme musician, an extension of the idea all artists need to suffered for their art.The movie then treats up to a series of disturbing scenes to underpin this idea in the hands of a frustrated university professor trying to find his genius. This pathological psychopath is nothing more than a sadist and bully who gets off on torturing and humiliating young vulnerable men.The movie is less than convincing as musicians are usually so driven they need to be told to practice less and be persuaded that perfection is unobtainable. Not to mention that musical progression occurs naturally in a supportive and collaborative environment.Whilst there were convincing performances the movie was an ugly mishmash of conflicting vestigial thoughts.The music was good as was the editing but the direction of this soulless material let to little character separation.Only near the end did the story try to justify the movies focus on brutality by trying to catch and fire this vile professor from his job at the university.Overall this movie left a nasty taste in the mouth with little or no resolution or redemption"

" Whiplash Review:
",2018-11-01 00:00:00,10,"This movie is without a doubt the best film of all time. It's crazy to believe that it's Damien Chazelle's first movie because nailed it. Miles teller did a fantastic job in this film, J.K Simmons was awesome, this is his best performance that I have seen and he really scared me of how amazing it was. The cinematography was perfect, soundtrack was perfect and the story is perfect. This is a highly recommend film it is amazing."
" I was completely drawn in by the movie and felt all sorts of emotions
",2018-10-31 00:00:00,8,"Whiplash is a story without a real hero. J.K. Simmons is a terrifying villain and Miles Teller is a self-absorbed masochist. That being said, this movie is absolutely compelling. I've never been in a band and I'm not a jazz fan, yet I was completely drawn in by the movie and felt all sorts of emotions - mostly fear, panic and anxiety. I hope to never encounter someone like Terence Fletcher in my lifetime."
" A study in bullying and acceptance thereof: drummer's blood
",2018-10-23 00:00:00,6,"Simmons may have picked up a supporting actor Oscar for this performance, and he may have deserved in comparison with the rest of competitors for that award in 2014, but it has to be said that he is a repulsive and manipulative bully and that his character is no example to anybody - quite the contrary. In fact, his eagerness to label others with derogatory and even insulting adjectives quickly becomes difficult to watch.If that is what is required for the human being to exceed his limitations - be it in music, sport, art, or any other field - then this is out and out human rights violation and I would rather live with a bit more mediocrity.Tellers tries his best in a difficult part, but the very ambiguity at the heart of his character's nature - in turns accepting and rejecting Simmons' bullying - detracts from the spectator's sympathy. His search for personal greatness as a drummer, at the expense of love and family, is a welcome warning to anyone thinking of following that path.And then I have a real problem accepting that Charlie Parker was the ""greatest musician of the 20th Century,"" as the central characters claim, and I do not care for the final rendition of ""Caravan,"" a wonderful piece of music that the two of them (Simmons unwillingly at first, then encouragingly) turn into a near solo drummer show.The unremittingly bleak photography and atmosphere; the characters' apparent failure to learn and become better human beings; and the director's emphasis on highlighting meanness and the absence of redemption with his chiaroscuro backgrounds, all made for an unpleasant movie experience for me."
" A different kind of beat
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,7,"It's different. It's tight. It's tense. I'm glad I saw it, but it's not a movie I want to see again. It tells its story well. Maybe it's just that the story is a little too real to be as entertaining as I wanted it be. The truth about what it takes to be great is harder than that. There is no fairy floss. There is is no escapism. Just bleeding knuckles."
" A solid, motivating experience. Fantastic!
",2018-10-20 00:00:00,10,"Whiplash (2014) is an ambitious, thought-provoking story about one young man willing to be the best! The movie is spectacular, and is so captivating when the main protagonist is rising to achieve his ultimate goal, but is affected by his mentor's teaching. Andrew (played by Miles Teller) is using his drum set to his advantage to be the best, as he is haunted by the talented, but reckless teacher, Terence Fletcher (played by J.K. Simmons) who steps in his way to achieve further.The movie is spectacular, and it really delivers some unexpected turns, emotional wreckageness, and fantastic determination that puts Andrew on a downward spiral of being ""out of control"" to reach his success. J.K. Simmons knows exactly how to push a ""student"" to beyond his potential, and Miles Teller knows how to survive with Simmons' teaching methods. He wants to be the best, the director SHOWS us how to be the best.It's fantastic, worth the watch. A 10/10, and it's very motivating it puts ME on a motivating spiral. Watch it, it's absolutely brilliant! Music + Creed = 3 BAFTA wins. Loved every minute of it!"
" It doesn't rush and it definitely doesn't drag.
",2018-10-14 00:00:00,8,"'Whiplash (2014)' is an experience in tension, a character study that's fantastic at giving you the same perspective as the protagonist while never really putting you in his headspace - that is to say, telling you exactly how he feels at every single moment. Its ultimate effect is an incredibly compelling, thematically rich one. It's an, at times, gruelling, almost hard-to-watch picture mainly because we care so much about our lead and want to see him succeed, a desire that is bolstered by the fact that we constantly see and hear the genuine skills (in the form of thunderous, top-class drumming) he's told he does not yet possess. This makes the central battle between him and his antagonistic teacher all the more agonising, urgent and investing, until it culminates a riveting confrontation and the whole things ends on a fantastic final beat. 8/10"
" Rings completely hollow and false, with no redeeming qualities.
",2018-10-12 00:00:00,1,"As a musician and a drummer, I was urged by a couple of different friends to watch this ""praised"" movie. Aside from a few of the JK Simmons insults, which I laughed at, there is nothing good about this film, as it clearly shows that the filmmaker and the editor know nothing about music or drumming. He reduces all of drumming to ""that's not my tempo"", thereby dumbing down the entire art form into a click track, meanwhile, revealing no insight into what it actually means to play the drums, or be a musician. The film won an Oscar for best editing, although, throughout the film, the drumming that you hear, and what you see being played by the unlikeable lead actor, do not match, and in the finale, the overhead shots obviously reveal that it is not the actor, but rather a stand-in musician. Both lead characters are unlikeable and actually ridiculous. Everything about the movie rings hollow, and, worst of all, false. The most ridiculous thing of all is how poorly and over-the-top he represents the drumming. Jazz drumming largely requires an ease of dexterity, not this growling buffoon using baseball-bat sized sticks, bleeding all over the snare drum, while making Rocky faces. Did I actually see the ride cymbal ""sweat"" ? Oh my God, it was so bad. If you fall for this piece of garbage, I don't know what to tell you ..."

" Fantastic drumming and brass but God awful plot
",2018-09-25 00:00:00,4,"Watched this film with great eagerness as heard rave reviews and although it shows fantastic work from the cast in general, the storyline is extremely poor and overreaching. Think anyone with any sense can tell being a successful musician is one of the hardest things to achieve in this lifetime let alone one of the most talented. But the approach from the teacher Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) would make Drill Sergeants wince, to push people to their limit is one thing, but to constantly do it over and over and over again would drive the most determined to fall short. The shots where Andrew (Miles Teller) is pushing himself constantly were over the top but somewhat realistic, but it all turns when he dumps his girlfriend (Mellisa Benoist) to concentrate on his career was as odd move in the film as she was barely in it in the first place. The part that tips this into the abyss is when Andrew is late and comes under fire from Fletcher and has to retrieve his drumming sticks only to be hit by a Truck. Not only does he walk miraculously but manages to get to the gig albeit to his demise. It just got worse from there really and the ending predictable. However, the performances were top class especially Miles Teller as he really through himself into the role. Sadly I just did not find enough for the dreadful and unrealistic storyline."
" A wide grin-inducing roller coaster of a film
",2018-09-25 00:00:00,9,"During my long-distant university days, for just a brief time I had a Latin percussion tutor by the name of Dave Hassell; a serious fella, a top notch professional drummer and by all accounts a bit of a task master according to the resident 'skin beaters' on my course. Certainly they were no strangers to putting in hours of practice above and beyond what might have been expected of them.Drums were not my instrument so I couldn't vouch for the intensity of his methods, but if he imposed even a quarter of Terence Fletcher's ferocity in his approach, then, my belated commiserations guys!Whiplash is a serious film about the serious business of jazz music, and wannabe jazz musicians.Terence Fletcher (played by the excellent J.K Simmons with uncompromising menace, bordering on the psychotic) is both revered and feared in equal measures by his students at Shaffer college, America's premiere music conservatory.Here, the students 'lucky' enough to make it into Fletcher's studio band are pushed to their very limits by his tough, uncompromising, almost boot camp style, none more so than newbie 'squeaker' Andrew Neeman (played with great conviction by Miles Teller) who aspires to be spoken of in the same breath as such jazz luminaries as drummer Buddy Rich.There's no room for sentiment or hard luck stories here in Fletcher's world and his methods and insatiable desire to discover his Charlie Parker or Buddy Rich, undoubtedly will break and indeed has broken many a determined spirit along the way.Neeman's initial, ambitious yet quiet and reflective demeanour gives way to a scowling, cynical selfishness and arrogance as the film progresses. How much of this is down to Fletcher's methods and how much of it is Neeman's possibly natural latent character is hard to say, but the change is definite, pronounced and unsettling.What follows is an exilharating tale of single-minded desire, drive, revenge and counter-revenge producing at times almost excruciating levels of tension as the plot twists and turns, keeping us guessing right until the very end where the whole thing crescendos to one hell of a tumultuous climax; a genuinely electrifying finale!It's absolutely riveting viewing, swept along by a brilliant, powerful and pounding Justin Hurwitz soundtrack.Whiplash fully deserves every last accolade it has already received and surely will continue to receive on it's full, UK cinema release.Not many films produce a loud cheer from a clearly enthralled cinema audience at the end - Whiplash did - as much, I'd imagine, a collective release from the film's at times tortuous tension as it was a joyous show of appreciation of what is clearly going to be a very strong contender for film of the year.Absolutely stunning!This and hundreds of other films are reviewed on my WaywardWolfBlog"
" Whiplash - The Cost of Obsession
",2018-09-23 00:00:00,10,"""There are no two words in the English language more harmful than 'good job'."" These are the words that encapsulate the crux of the narrative in Damien Chazelle's 2014 drama Whiplash. In the broadest of terms, Whiplash is the story of Andrew (played with many layers by Miles Teller) and his road to become one of the greatest jazz drummers in history. Along the way, his passion and tenacity for the art is tested by Fletcher (the Sergeant Hartman-influenced university professor acted fantastically by J.K. Simmons), who pushes his subjects to such an extreme that I will not spoil in this review. That's it; it's a tale of the obsessed artist. The film is much more a character study then a story-driven one. One thing that Chazelle excels at with this film is character to character interactions and relationship development. Every exchange between Fletcher and Andrew (which is a majority of the film) creates so much tension in the space they're in, you'd think a bomb was about to go off. There hasn't been this kind of tension through dialogue since The Social Network. With all that said, even when there isn't a verbal sparring match between our two leads, the narrative remains immensely compelling. Andrew's relationship with his father (played by Paul Reiser) is a notable example. Andrew's father is a man whose dream was to become a famous novelist, but after his first attempt was unsuccessful, he relinquished his dream and became a high school teacher. This foil to Andrew is what he fears for himself. In plain terms, the way the movie is written and acted plays to this idea that everyone in Andrew's life is the enemy; everyone except his real enemy, Fletcher. Andrew also has a brief relationship with Nicole (played by now-Supergirl Melissa Benoist), a girl he meets at a classic movie theater. Ironically, the relationship starts and ends for essentially the same reason. Andrew's newly instilled confidence warps into hubris as he works more and more with Fletcher, with Nicole being an unfortunate bystander in their crossfire. Their relationship ends with one of the most blunt breakup scenes (possibly ever), leaving the audience with a sour taste of Andrew, but at the same time understanding why he did what he did. On top of being a well-written, albeit simple, story, the film boasts some impressive technical elements. Firstly, the camera work. The film's D.o.P. is Sharone Meir, whose previous work is mostly with television, with a few exceptions like the Last House on the Left remake in 2009. The camera is mostly locked down to a tripod, with the occasional panning shots. Once Andrew begins his descent into obsession, the camera work becomes more and more loose, reflecting his mental and physical state. On top of that, the camera work is clever in its composition as well. Fletcher is an imposing figure, made more clear by the fact that he's always standing about Andrew in almost every shot up to a certain point in the film. Andrew is constantly being looked down upon by this giant, screaming and cursing up a storm; his version of ""encouragement."" Fletcher is always big in the shot, taking up a sizable amount of screen time with medium close-up and close-up shots. Finally, the last major aspect of the film is the music. Director Damien Chazelle channels his inner Buddy Rich on this film, with himself being a longtime drummer. It's important to note that a large majority of the playing in the film is done by Teller, making his performance all the more impressive. The film's score is essentially played out on screen, with composer Justin Hurwitz helming the rest of the non-song-based scoring. The music further reinforces the overall intensity of the film, with a hectic and complex pieces of big band jazz music like the titular ""Whiplash"" and the epic ""Caravan."" 
 
In summation, Whiplash is a tightly-written, well-shot, well-acted drama that will surely be remembered for years to come. Every character has a purpose, every shot has a purpose. The film builds and builds in tension similar to that of a good horror film, yet the monsters aren't physically there on screen, but behind the eyes of our characters. All this to one of the best endings to a film, in my opinion, ever. Whiplash never disappoints, and should be regarded as one of the best new millennium films out there."
" Really hard to watch
",2018-09-20 00:00:00,8,"This film was really tough to watch. Not in a bad way at all, just in a really intense way. It was an incredibly tense film, the blood motif being a huge part of it. I loved how they focused on blood and perspiration on Andrew's hands, sticks, and drums. It just really helped me realize the pain Andrew was feeling in these scenes. I thought J.K Simmons did an excellent job with the role as well, he was very intimidating. Awkwardness and fear are present in a lot of the scenes in this film. The opening scene, not quite my tempo, Andrew getting replaced by that red haired kid, the ending scene when Fletcher tries to destroy Andrew's musical career. It was all executed so perfectly. I also really enjoyed the lighting. It had a really dark, warm feeling to it. I think this made us feel like the college is a sort of home to these kids, that's just the feeling I got from the warm colors. I don't know how I feel about Fletcher's character yet. He's undoubtedly a total dick, but it's also pretty easy to argue that he is doing the best thing anyone could do for the kids in the college. They are all there because they want to become incredible musicians, that's why they attended the most prestigious music college in the country, so pushing them to the edge of their potential could really be the best thing Fletcher could do for them, period. My major takeaway from the film is to not give up on your dreams. Andrew had essentially given up on his dream of becoming ""one of the greats"" after he assaulted Fletcher on stage, but decided to stick with it and put on an absolutely incredible performance that even impressed Fletcher. On top of all of this, the soundtrack was pretty damn good. I'm actually listening to Caravan right now as I'm writing this review. There was also a huge focus on the actual music in the movie, it wasn't just used as a plot device. When music was playing, we got to see Andrew either watch or play it, for quite a long time. I really liked that. Anyway, this is a great movie. It was really tough to watch. I felt horrible for Andrew at many points during this film, and J.K Simmons made his character so incredibly intimidating that I felt uncomfortable any time he was talking to Andrew."
" Immense film to a point of being troubling

I took far too long to see this film with the mistaken view of it being quite simple, simple in set up yes, simple in intensity and emotion defiantly not. i'm not quite sure how Miles Teller didn't get at least nominated for an Oscar for this but i'm guessing he will be in the running again soon."

In my eyes, though, the movie fails to deeper unfold the reality, thus staying at a more superficial level, which leads to something like ""with maximum effort you will achieve success"". But that is not always true, sometimes the result may even be fatal! In my opinion it is very important to look more carefully at the harsh teacher in this movie: Is he a brilliant teacher, getting the best out of his students, even though he lets them bleed for that?
Let's look at his known results: 1 student was very successful, 1 student killed himself because of him. Most of his impact was ""not directly shown"", all the other students, being no musical geniuses, are more or less irrelevant to him, though he massively damaged their self-confidence... E.g. chances are that ""fat"" guy may kill himself, too, later on.
Sure, the teacher indeed _wants_ to get the best out of his students, but his methods could not be more wrong. The movie should have shown a few more minutes of footage looking at the bad outcomes for ""all the other persons"" terrorized. Moreover the teacher totally fails to encourage self esteem and creativity, instead he demands strict obedience and formal precision above everything else.That man truly is mentally disturbed: What most matters should be the well being of people. In which world would we are living if many students would be formed like that? This kind of treatment badly changes the character of ""successful"" students to be mentally disturbed themselves (stockholm syndrom etc.), being cold and unfair to others, making society worse.Even if one of his students manages to play one of the best concerts ever (like the drummer boy here), will that guy really be happy afterwards for more than a short time? Someone so completely focussed on success, that he goes on stage bleeding after a car accident, ignoring everything? I doubt it! Even insulting his girl friend that she is ""not good enough"", sacrificing the wishes of his heart, just for fame...?Chances are that after his biggest successes, he will realize he is still not happy and will kill himself. Like it happened often enough with famous artists, sadly...Of course, he _says_ he wants to be remembered and rather die young than not to be famous etc., but these are the words of a young boy, not having much experience, no insight in philosophy, sense of life, social responsibility, religion (Karma), morale etc. Small positive things do matter much, he just does not see it. On the other hand he overrates the impact of a successful jazz drummer, many people not even hear that type of music. In my eyes it is very obvious that the achieved success could definitely not balance out the severe social damage that was caused.Overall, though, the movie is well done and worth watching, if you are able to look behind the curtain and see that the ""way to success"" shown here, is an illusion made by a mentally ill teacher."
" 10/10
",2018-08-22 00:00:00,10,"Excellent movie. I loved both J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller's performances. The movie is so relatable for people like me, that undergo daily stress and hard mental work. Andrew seems like a likeable guy with a bright future that has to make tough decisions, and I love how he manages his life."
" Totally quite my tempo!
",2018-08-18 00:00:00,10,"Every scene, every detail, every line, every character in the movie just working perfectly in harmony from the begining till the end. And, man, this is totally quite my tempo!"
" Impeccably written film!
",2018-08-17 00:00:00,9,"I don't like jazz! BUT I repeated this film a couple of times. This was not because I did not understand something, but because I couldn't get enough of it. It is not just the music that got me for the first time, it is the whole composition, the writing, the acting, the directing, the cinematography, and everything works together in perfect harmony.The writing of the film keeps you captivated from beginning to end. 2:42 Minutes into the movie with opening credits included, we already know what Andrew Nieman's goal is to get into Fletcher's band. He heard that he was looking for players and he went for it. In this very short time, we learn the kind of a person Fletcher is and the dialogue is concise, impeccable and filled with lots of subtext. Now that is some opening! It starts with the inciting incident. Andrew gets a mini audition for Fletcher and 'unimpressed' he shut the door on him. What is he going to do? In this very small space of time, we already know that Fletcher is an abusive conductor, he just called him a monkey, and this kind of language and insult is what he carries out throughout the film. By reading the first two pages of the film and by watching the first 2 minutes of the film, you already know your decision to continue with the film or not. Now in screenwriting, you are often told that the first 10 pages will make the reader to continue reading or not. Whiplash makes that decision very easy in just TWO! The characters are both very strong. The goal is established. The conflict is clear.In this review I would like to focus exclusively on the characters and the writing. The film looks at two completely different and conflicting characters with the same goal- BEING THE BEST IN THE MUSIC SCENE. Their ideas of the phenomena are however, completely different. Fletcher is the leading conductor at Shaffer Conservatory where his band comprises of only the best. He is rude, emotionally and psychologically abusive, self-absorbed, and punctual. He is an extremely organized man who seemingly cares only about winning. He is willing to step on everyone's toes to attain his goal.The film makes use of very subtle subtexts to reveal his character. When Fletcher invites the 19 year old Andrew to his band practice for the first time he tells him that it starts at 6am and that he shouldn't be late. Andrew wakes up at 6:03 and he does not even consider brushing his teeth. He runs like a maniac to the studio only to find that the practice starts at 9am. When the clock hits exactly 9am, Fletcher enters the studio, not a second later. This idea of time, in a form of tempo drives the whole film. Fletcher has a sharp ear and he can hear if a particular individual is out of tune or is not playing to the right tempo. And tempo/time is what carries the conflict. Andrew has to fight to be in Fletcher's tempo if he wants to remain the core drummer in the band or otherwise he will be paging the music score for another drummer forever.Andrew on the other hand, goes to Shaffer with his main goal being to be part of Fletcher's leading band in the city and most probably in the world. He is a talented drummer, who is naive, competitive and willing to do anything to win Fletcher's approval of him. Both Andrew and Fletcher are strong characters from beginning to end.Often times in screenwriting, you are told that characters need to undergo transformation in the film; that they should have changed by the end of the film. However, in Fletcher's case, he gets you fooled for a moment where you sincerely believe that being fired from the studio has made him a better person when he meets Andrew for the first time since their last fight which ended up with Andrew being kicked out of Shaffer. Here, Fletcher invites Andrew to come play with him at his next performance where the key people in the industry will be present. This seemingly is Fletcher looking for a fresh start and giving Andrew another chance. At this point, Andrew had put music behind him and had put away everything music in his life. But again, a big part of him needs Fletcher's approval that he is the best drummer. By the end of the film, you find out that Fletcher did not change at all. The film ends with him being the same schemer, who is self-absorbed, and conniving as he was in the beginning. Andrew has become more mature by the end of the film. How he handles Fletcher's blow is completely different. By the end he has learned to fight and prove that Fletcher is not the person who has his future in his hand. For the first time, he is in control and there is nothing Fletcher can do about it but follow Andrew's lead. Earlier in the film when Fletcher screwed him up, Andrew resolved the conflict but by the end, he learns to let music fight for him. He goes head to head with Fletcher and would not let him take the opportunity to be the best drummer in the world from him again.In conclusion, Whiplash is one of the well-crafted films in the industry. It has strong characters with powerful dialogue lines. The conflict is great from beginning to end. It is captivating, it is moving emotionally, it is great writing overall.I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO HASN'T SEEN IT!!!"
" Drum roll please.....
",2018-08-16 00:00:00,9,"I've played guitar for 22 years, bass for about 19 years and drums for less than three. I'm pretty good at guitar and bass and intensely average on drums but this is probably because I have only ever viewed these instruments as fun. I never intended to set out to be the best there is, was or ever will be; I play them because I enjoy it and I can express myself through the strings and sticks. In this respect, I'm in the vast majority of players. Genius doesn't think like that. Geniuses are born with that certain something and then devote themselves to an eternity of practice, rudiments, blood, sweat and tears to get to where they want to be and then improve on that. Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) is one such prodigy; a gifted young jazz drummer who has won a place at the esteemed Schaffer Music School and it is here that he meets Fletcher. Imagine if R. Lee Ermey's drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket was taking tips from The Thick Of It's Malcolm Tucker in the art of personal relations and then give him sheet music and the role of band conductor. That's Fletcher, a truly hateful character but one whom you buy into completely thanks to the performance of the always majestic J.K. Simmons and the fact that despite his monstrousness, one can see what he's doing. His plan is to wring every last drop of sweat and blood out of his musicians so that they may be the next Charlie Parker. He just chooses to do so through intimidation and terrific insults. He's happy to be the bad guy if it makes the good guy great. This is where the film succeeds so completely, in the at-times unbearably tense relationship between two men who want the same thing: perfection. Whiplash doesn't get everything right. There's a love story that feels as unnecessary as it is light and I do wonder if non musicians will get the same out of this film as players will because if you're a musician (and especially if you're a drummer), this film is practically porn. Teller is clearly a gifted drummer because as far as I could tell, what you see and hear are the same; the people on screen are really playing and it's spellbinding. That said, I think it's a film that will get past any concerns about it being niche due to the ferocity of the performances. You certainly don't have to like jazz and I hope you don't have to be a musician to appreciate fully this dramatic, tense and utterly terrific film. 9/10"
" The. Perfect. Film.
",2018-08-13 00:00:00,10,"This is one of the greatest films of all time. Always on beat, never off tempo, and selling the art it portrays to such a unique level.The performances are great. Miles Teller stands out a bit but ultimately is overshadowed by the incredible J.K. Simmons. This goes down as one of the greatest supporting acts in history. You'd be scared of Terrance Fletcher from the moment you saw him, and there's never a beat when you're not.The story is unpredictable, with a masterfully crafted ending. Damien Chazelle might be a genius. The writing embraces Jazz and becomes a part of it.The direction is one of the best directions I have ever seen. From the very first sequence, we're pulled in and never pushed out. We're in for a ride that'll make us gasp, cry, and cheer.The music is an essential component of this film and it shines quite well. As a jazz trumpeter in high school, this music brings me back and lets me feel alive again. Thank you Justin Hurwitz.Whiplash is a unique experience everyone should see. 10/10."
" A top class movie with bulletproof acting and directing
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,10,"This is by far one of my most favourite movies I've ever seen. The ending scene gave me goosebumps, it is an absolute stunning masterpiece.
The storyline is well balanced with tensity, heartache and drama. It also manages to fit in a parallel lovestory.
J.K Simmons' performance is extremely good throughout the whole movie which it even more paralyzing. Simmons burning passion for his role makes his character (Terrence Fletcher) seem like satan itself in some occurances, and in others like a whole different person. It is impossible to take your eyes off him while he performes. Every step, move and breathtake that Simmons takes is bulletproof and proffessionally done, making his character very entertaing.
The masterly written script, the fantastic acting and the well directing creates a movie that you wont be able to take your eyes off."
" Fantastic
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,8,"Great performances, directing, cinematography....the list goes on and on. There's many things to love about Chazelle's 'Whiplash' and so much depth to explore. The mood is ever changing, the opposition is heated and entertaining and the climax is extremely satisfying I can't recommend this more"
" All Round Good Film With An Amazing J.K. Simmons
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,9,"The characters were believable and the set up unique. J.K. Simmons was amazing in in his portrayal of the relentless Terrence Fletcher.I'm not musical, but I loved this film. I believe there are many people similar to Terrence Fletcher but I've never seen these people represented on the big screen. The relationship between the two main characters is complex and ever evolving.I'm unsure if I liked the ending, though it had its good points too. It left you judging whether Terrence was good or bad. I just wish that the film had more a take-home message. As you can see my rating though, this didn't affect my enjoyment too much."
" Realy good one at all
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,10,"The most sense i have never forget ever, there is no word can harm you more than ""good job"""
" Gritty, impactful stuff
",2018-07-27 00:00:00,10,"This film is an extremely intense watch. The characterisation, soundtrack and story blend together in a nightmarish realism. The themes explored in Whiplash ought to ring true with anyone who has been through the education system and fallen prey to high expectations and the desire to succeed. Miles Teller does an excellent job portraying the protag - someone who has a strong need for stardom or recognition, and feels unsupported by his family who don't seem to value his interests. There are a couple of twists in this film that make it really engaging and unpredictable. Definitely a must watch."
" amazing
",2018-07-27 00:00:00,10,Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good
" Never written a review before till now..
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,10,Finally gotten around to watching this.... and all I can say is wow! Can't think of a single film that has left me feeling exhilirated and utterly emotionally drained after watching this thrilling masterpiece.
" Painful and Brilliant
",2018-07-23 00:00:00,10,"Truthfully, there really isn't a beginning, middle, or end in Whiplash. This is more a a philosophical journey with a ambitious artist and an even more ambitious teacher. There are dialogues and scene that are almost too painful to watch, but really make you think. J. K. Simmons is the perfect antihero (I wouldn't call him a villain). Simmons comes off as a terrible person, but really he's the push everyone needs in life to succeed. I know I reflected on all the negative people who affected my life and began to wonder if negative criticism is more powerful than positive criticism."
" A Perfect Film
",2018-07-20 00:00:00,10,"While watching a great film, you can either be transported to a fictional place or connect with a realistic situation. Damian Chazelle blends these two to create the best modern tragedy/drama film there is.
Damian Chazelle uses dialogue and visuals to introduce and explore characters better than many recent directors. Once these characters are introduced, we begin to make connections with these characters. The main character, Andrew, has a goal of becoming the best drummer of all time. Although this specific goal isn't something we can all connect with, Chazelle manipulates us so that for an hit and 40 minutes all we want is for Andrew to become the best drummer. 
Fletcher, his tyrannical teacher, is his main obstacle. Jk Simmons puts on a near perfect performance conveying his complete understanding of his character.
Chazelle focuses mainly on his characters to develop the story. Through this he creates stakes, revelations, and brings out or emotions."
" ""Good Job""
",2018-07-19 00:00:00,9,"What an experience this journey with Andrew was. An absolute rollercoaster of emotions from start to finish. This film manages to motivate and inspire me to work harder, do better and let nothing stop me from getting what I want. That's how you know it's a masterpiece."
" Excellent piece of acting performance, music and direction !
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,8,"Whiplash is one of those films with a solid but very specific story. The plot revolves around two central characters - an aspiring drummer Andrew (Miles Teller) and his jazz mentor Fletcher (J.K Simmons). Fletcher, an 'explosive' hard task-master, is one of those who believe that best musicians are nurtured only when they are pushed to perform beyond expectations and shall not settle for ""just good"". His way of teaching challenges Andrew emotionally, mentally and physically almost to his breaking point.
The movie sticks to it's central plot and characters, with no superfluous side plots, and thus has the viewer's best attention to Andrew's hardships under Fletcher. Both the characters are exceptionally well played-out by the seasoned actors. Since the movie is based on jazz, the movie is full of it (no expert here, but kind of enjoyed it). Fletcher's scoldings and arguments as a music teacher resemble more to those of a military commander. Nevertheless, some are very impactful and note-worthy (Like- There are no two words in the English language more harmful than ""good job"" ). While the methods of teaching music depicted in the movie are questionable (especially in the field of art where expression and individuality are essence), but movie does well to engage and amaze the audience. The ending though might seem a little abrupt, with unanswered viewer question of what happened next. The movie also does seem to bring forth a crucial question of what real greatness is and does opinion and approval of certain people matter for feeling worthy.
Watch it for excellent film making, story and acting performance by Miles and Simmons."
" a very intense movie
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,9,"Whiplash is one of the most intense movie I've seen of all time, the film is very well acted and written and directed, the two main actors are great and the music is really good, one of the main themes of the film is that negative reinforcement is a good thing and the film leaves many things to interpretation to whatever that a good thing or not, the music post production syncs with the music played in the movie a lot, well there are times where the music doesn't sync with the music in the movie, the third act is very intense and one of the best third acts i ever seen,
J. K. Simmons character motivation is left interpretation it's not clear whatever he cares miles tellers character or not, overall the movie is a very intense and it's funny and the music is really good."
" A masterpiece - Straight up!
",2018-07-14 00:00:00,10,"Just do yourself a favour - watch this movie! Its both fascinating, surprising and chocking - made with a lot of charm and wit! A masterpiece - Straight up!"
" breath taking
",2018-07-13 00:00:00,10,"This movie is nothing but a breath-taking/magnificent master piece.
I actually decided to belong to the jazz circle in my uni because of this movie.
The most amazing thing to me is that the drummer (the hero) plays drums by himself; no CG. Even that there is the scene that the drummer bleeds from his hands and this is his real blood!
What I want to say is that how devoting this actor is. I have never been bleeding from my hand practicing music. But this actor did and his drumming skills are literally breath-taking!"
" Easily watchable and enjoyable.
",2018-07-09 00:00:00,8,"Well i had number of movies last night in my watch list. It was really tough to select a movie from such amazing collection. I was actually looking for a short, not much complex and simple adventurous yet inspiring movie.This movie had all the ingredients I was looking for, I was also wondering during opening credits, that by trailer it looked like a movie about a student and his tough, strict and abusive coach which kind of made the movie predictable. But still I was hoping some character twist that's why it was so popular.This movie from start till end is engaging and entertaining, there is not a single dull moment, and because of much detailed and inspiring sequences, it looked like a biopic movie many times, and I was amazed that all it is, is a fictional story.Performances by Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons were amazing, in fact watching Sir J.K Simmons was so pleasurable, and his performance was so flawless and believable. The other actors Paul Reiser as Andrew's father Melissa Benoist as beautiful Nicole and the other actors as musician were amazing in their roles as well.In a nutshell, this is a worth watching movie. You will not be bored and it will give you some inspiration for your career and way of thinking."
" One of the worst films I've ever had the displeasure of watching!
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,1,"The film is probably best enjoyed by musicians or jazz enthusiasts. This is an acquired taste. There is no denying JK Simmons gave an Oscar-winning performance, and yes, the editing was Oscar-worthy as well. But for most parts of the film I can't say it was a pleasure watching this. I can still enjoy a bad horror B-movie, but certainly not this. I did not agree with Fletcher's teaching methods, as it was total abuse. This movie should be used as educational material for methods teachers should NOT use. It was disgusting - to say the least - how he treated and spoke to the youngsters. In fact, so much so it should be considered a crime. There was not a single moment of the film I enjoyed. On the contrary, this horrible movie is one of the most hated films I've ever seen. Why has it been voted one of the best films ever???
Note: I rated the film 1/10 not because it is a badly made movie. It's a very well made movie, but I just did not enjoy it at all, hence the low rating."
" Brilliantly crafted and fantastically brutal
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,10,"Lets be honest, guys. This is one of those movies where the story sounds lame, but the movie... well, we can just say it speaks for itself.I'll be honest, when I pressed play on this, I had absolutely no idea what I was walking into; I was just willing to try it. The intro drumming began, the first shot of Andrew with the camera slowly moving down a corridor came to... I was hooked. This movie does not suffer because of the lack of atmosphere at all; it doesn't need music. In fact, it utilises the jazz music that the movie is based around to provide the atmosphere, which may be one of the cleverest techniques I've seen; it helps to engage in the film far quicker than you may usually do, similar to the music at the start of 2001: A Space Odyssey. In fact, Whiplash is incredible looking at it from a critical perspective; the way the title is interweaved with the movie's theme, the music, the acting, the direction, the dialogue; everything. I could write a 10 page essay on how good this movie is and why.Fletcher's character is ingenious, probably the most well developed, intruiging movie character I've ever encountered. His character creates all these senses of fascination, but with a brutal deliverance that allows those emotions to be mixed with an element of fear. Trust me, you won't soon find another one like him. His dialogue is so clever, made to feel like nothing and everything is due to happen in the moments that follow the one you are engaged in. The huge amount of swearing only serves to add character; and in fact, Fletcher is so well crafted, you can almost feel the way Andrew changes throughout the film as he gradually loses his humility and nearly all his positivity, in multiple scenes drumming so intensely that he makes his hands bleed, then plasters them up and continues drumming. The story... wow, the story is good. It's absolutely relentless with its harsh telling, with shouting, swearing and equipment being thrown at people's heads at every twist and turn. In fact, it offers the whole package; determination, completely unpredicted twists, one of the most brilliant character motive stories in the form if Fletcher's explanation, even an out-of-nowhere shocking moment. And yet everything is cleverly integrated, along with the music, to make you feel a part of the whole traumatic experience.To give you an idea of how powerful this movie is, my mind has been flashing back to it's best scenes every day for a month now. Despite how hard it is to watch, struggle on, because you will never critically view a movie the same way again."
" One of the best!
",2018-06-15 00:00:00,10,"A great film, very well structured. The music is amazing and has good flow. Final scene is outstanding!"
" Love the camera work
",2018-06-09 00:00:00,8,"I first watched this film in my script writing class back in college and I immediately fell in love with the camera work. The acting was amazing but, the camera work more so is why i liked it so much. Specifically the work with the drums."
" It's the drill instructor from Full Metal Jacket as a jazz instructor.
",2018-05-31 00:00:00,9,"Whiplash is a great film for a few reasons, the same reasons for which it won its corresponding awards. J.K. Simmons does an excellent performance, the sound design is excellent, and the editing is excellent. Beyond this, there is nothing particularly excellent in the film, and a number of elements to find fault though the pros largely outweigh the cons.Probably the most interesting aspect of the film is J.K. Simmons' performance as Terence Fletcher, a ruthless jazz instructor. Every moment that he is on screen is intense and often comical in a very cruel way, almost to a comical degree. His character is basically that of the drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket, throwing vulgar insults at his students without hesitation. Thankfully, he's a huge part of this film, thus he is allowed to carry it drastically. He's a lot of fun, and his performance is one of the most high energy performances I have seen this decade. Miles Teller did a fine job as Andrew Neiman, but he is largely overshadowed by his antagonizing instructor.The editing also played a huge role in the entertainment value of this film. The pacing felt just about perfect, which is especially important in a musical film. The beats through the film are almost rhythmic, making the film seem fully realized in its premise, elevating it far above the usual mediocrity, which also aids in Fletcher's attempts at beating perfection out of his students. It's a thoroughly exciting film largely in part to the editing. It truly is thoroughly exciting and quite inspirational in an extremely tough, critical way that has almost become extinct in today's politically correct society.The sound design is an extremely important aspect in a musical film, and it's certainly excellent in this film. There are no distracting elements throughout the film, as everything is right at the level it needs to be. The soundtrack is as intense as the film itself, and is never overwhelmed by external sources, even with Fletcher throwing in insults during live performances. Aside from one intentionally stylized sequence, the visuals perfectly match the audio in the musical performances throughout, and there are moments in which the film isn't afraid to shake things up and provide us with scenarios in which the main character messes up performances for specific reasons, such as injury, or being made to play a piece he couldn't have known prior, and the results are suitably bad in a believable way.One gripe I have with this film is just how unbelievable the circumstances are. I cannot suspend my disbelief as in reality someone like Fletcher would most certainly be immediately fired, and likely sued on top of that. Not only is he verbally abusive throughout the film, but he is also physically violent as well. There's a scene where he slaps our main character repeatedly to train him to keep proper tempo, and this simply wouldn't fly in real life, especially not in a large class like Fletcher's. Not only this, but he also demands the drummers to play as fast as they can for literally hours until their hands are bleeding significantly during one practice session. Beyond this, he also kicks and tosses furniture around, sometimes at students, and his excuse for this is that a famous musician, Charlie Parker, didn't become great until he was ""nearly decapitated"" with a cymbal thrown at him. This is however grossly exaggerated, as the cymbal was thrown at Parker's feet. While I can accept Fletcher's reasoning for tough love and the harm in saying ""good job"" to a talented individual, as complacency is the death of art and a huge problem especially in this day and age.Fletcher's critical attitude seems very unrealistic to me. Fletcher's ability to determine tempo with microscopic accuracy almost comes off as a super power. While I could agree with him at times, at others he would flip out for something that by any reasonable standards was close enough to be indiscernible. The movie almost devolved into insanity as it made a simple beat out to be the most impossible task in the entire world.The plot isn't all too engaging either. It's simple, and is serviceable, but it didn't astonish me. The ending was largely unsatisfying, as the main character felt less triumphant and more so like a battered housewife with Stockholm Syndrome. Fletcher doesn't quite get his comeuppance, and Neiman doesn't quite stand up for himself. It's simply not all that satisfying, and the one moment where Neiman finally breaks down and attacks Fletcher is too light and too short-lived to make it satisfying.Most other elements were fine but not beyond fine. Supporting characters were sort of just there, and didn't really add more to the film rather than being stand-ins or human punching bags for Fletcher. It's almost odd that as the movie goes on, Fletcher seems to ignore all of his other students and simply focuses on Neiman with all of his attention and criticism by the end.I would recommend this movie to just about anybody, except grandma perhaps, as she might find the language offensive. It's certainly interesting enough to watch either on a casual level or a critical level."

" Fletcher Must Die
",2018-05-25 00:00:00,1,"Early on this movie establishes that ""Whiplash"" has nothing to do with music and everything to do with sadism. No movie has ever made you hate a villain as this movie makes you hate Prof. Fletcher."
" Magical

As a movie lover I cannot forget my love for drums and will say that the music is fantastic and the editing is electrifying. However, it is because I love the story, the great performance of the actors that I will say that the movie is unequal. Some sequences are magical and sometimes it feels like another movie. This could be a pure perfection... All I've got it's a good movie. For my part Whiplash is a classical."
" For the record, Metz wasn't out of tune. You were, Erickson, but he didn't know and that's bad enough.

Terence Fletcher is one of those teachers who can inspire and terrify you all at once. He is also abusive to his band of students. His relationship with Andrew is quite complex. The film is quite dark sometimes with lighting and scenery. Andrew goes to great lengths to arrive at a competition.

The story deals with this drummer who is offered by the music teacher to join his band and even though he agrees, the band leader is an overly hostile tough-as-nails guy who realizes he might have met his match in terms of who's more demanding. Very exciting and well paced."
" Rubbish!
",2018-05-20 00:00:00,1,As a professional drummer all my working life I had high hopes for this film. I am sorry as I could only stomach 15 minutes of this totally unrealistic load of rubbish! Music can't be created in some sort of boot camp fear school. Other people are saying this is a great film? Maybe if you are not a musician you might think it is realistic but really within five minutes I wanted to puke.

" One of the very best films of the 21st Century.
",2018-05-01 00:00:00,8,"Teacher-student relationships have always been heavily romanticized in movies for years; the ability to inspire young minds to believe in themselves in order to accomplish great things is no easy task. As expounded on, a year before Whiplash, in Blue is the Warmest Color, we all want guidance, a mentor, in this unknowable world and we try to find that in various outlets; one of those being our teachers and educators. Damien Chazelle's sophomore feature Whiplash begins with Andrew (Miles Teller) coming to think he has found that person in the demanding, hot-tempered and never-satisfied force-of-nature that is enigmatic Jazz Band Conductor Terrance Fletcher (J.K Simmons). There is the old introspective exercise of listing the most difficult teachers to get through their classes, then listing the teachers you got the most out of when you were their student, most of the time with those lists coinciding with one another one-to-one. It speaks to the things that push our limits actually in fact come to define who we are.Miles Teller reaches new heights as the the promising upstart Drumming talent enrolled at a Juilliard-esque University Conservatory music program. He can only see the castles in the sky for himself, he just needs to find a way to build the foundation to them. His turn in The Spectacular Now as the free spirited teenager Sutter, who gets a lesson in the school of hard knocks put him on the map, made him a talent to watch out for in the future. Here as Andrew; however, the actor is the very antithesis of the easy-going carefree teen in his previous movie. The guy knows what he wants and becomes incensed, doesn't let anyone get in the way of that and will do whatever it takes to get it.J.K. Simmons, in the role of his career so far, plays Terence Fletcher, a jazz band director at a prestigious music school in NYC, who represents, in a sense, the darkest parts of our self-conscious. He hurls insults, screams with frustration, and even threatens with physical and emotional pain. He infuses doubt so that those who ""have it"" are separated from those ""who don't"", or at least from those who ""can't take it"". A little bit of Fletcher is in all of us, putting ourselves down when we lack the courage to do something we want to do, but don't have the nerve to act on.If you have struggled to succeed and/or believe there is some grand purpose to your life that has yet to reveal itself, then you may find Damien Chazelle's fabulous Whiplash strangely revealing."
" Inspired me to follow the director's career decisions
",2018-05-01 00:00:00,10,Beyond inspired by Damien Chazelle! When I watched this movie I wanted to see the world through his eyes. As well as his style in writing and directing!
" Quite my tempo :D
",2018-04-30 00:00:00,9,"""To be honest, I liked the music in the book better."" :DOut of story that can be told in five sentences they made two hours long movie. And not only that it isn't boring, but it pulls you in, blows you away and leaves you with goosebumps for hours after it's over.9/10"
" Absolutely masterful.
",2018-04-22 00:00:00,10,"This film is the kind of film where you want to watch it again immediately after the ending credits roll. It's easily in my top 10 of all time. Simmons and Teller are completely incredible in their roles. Some of the best performances I've ever seen.What needs to be said of this film has already been said. But after having seen it upwards of 7 times, I would watch it again and again until the play button is worn from my remote.Masterful."
" incredible
",2018-04-21 00:00:00,10,"I don't even know where to start, First of all it is incredibly acted. J.K. Simmons has one of the best supporting performances ever. Because of this however the other actors don't get enough credit, Miles Teller does a great a job and I honestly think he should have been nominated for an oscar, he wasn't as good as (J.K. Simmons though.) The story and dialogue are both really good, most of us have had something we wanted to do and others will put us down. This is too the extreme, Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) takes it to another level with Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) he rips him apart! The psychological battles between them. The insults are almost like ones in a Tarantino movie (and i mean that in a very good way.) The ending is very powerful butt the last maybe minute and the last second was a bit corny but that doesn't matter at all. Even though this movie has been out for almost 4 years I still won't give too much away, just watch it."

" Scary...disturbing....a master class in abusive behavior.....but an EXCELLENT film.
",2018-04-16 00:00:00,10,"Well.....one thing's for sure - this movie clearly polarized the reviewers. Numerous 9 and 10 ratings, and a whole heap of 1 to 3 ratings. This alone shows we aren't dealing with an ordinary movie - it's exceptional. As you can see, I'm with the 9 and 10 ratings - rarely have I seen a more though provoking and challenging movie. It's an essay in obsession and how those who are obsessed can and are exploited by others to fulfil their own needs. Definitely not pretty. Definitely not pleasant viewing. But a compelling examination of manipulation and ruthless behavior, and what it does to the victims.Fascinatingly, a lot of the low-scoring reviews come from people who felt the movie didn't realistically portray what might actually happen in a top (music) school. Or that they felt the manipulation being dished out by the JK Simmons / Fletcher role was too repellent to be true. Seems it just made a lot of people very, very uncomfortable, and they watched behaviors they'd rather believe don't exist. Two points to that. Firstly, the film is clearly allegorical - I agree that in this day and age it's unlikely that the sort of scenarios described would for a moment be tolerated in any decent, Western school. That said, we see around us in the papers every day a storm of evidence of where the powerful in positions of trust have done essentially what was portrayed in the film, and much worse to boot. So I for one believe that this film is a very valuable examination of the model that can exist where a trusted person in a position of power builds themselves up by tearing down, playing off and humiliating ruthlessly those left in their trust.J K Simmons in my view stole the show. He convincingly created a role of pure evil. Initially he ingratiates himself with the vulnerable young Miles Teller / Andrew role. Naively Andrew believes he may have found a champion. Fairly quickly we see that Fletcher is in fact a very nasty piece of work who thrives in brutally playing off one member of the band against the other. His word is law, and anyone who even looks like challenging him is ruthlessly crushed. He's charming when he thinks it will benefit him (like many narcissists) but exists only to build his own ego at the expense of those around him. Ruthless, abusive, manipulative.....bullying isn't nearly strong enough - he's a psychopath.Sadly - the kids he's dealing with are either too scared of him to react, or they are hoping that they may avoid his wrath and benefit from the ""discipline"" he exerts.This film's message is so direct and powerful that I'd almost suggest it should be compulsory viewing for all kids in early youth. The ""take away"" would be....YES...people like this DO exist, and they will destroy anyone who lets a monster like this into their lives. So know what you are dealing with, and absolutely keep your distance."
" Solid flick
",2018-04-14 00:00:00,3,Solid flick but not an 8.5. Currently outranking films such as Lion King and Gladiator.
" You are either the best or you are not to be remembered at all and that's the whole point of this miserable life.
",2018-04-04 00:00:00,9,"This is my second review and English is not my mother tongue, so keep that in mind, would you?
This movie has affected me in so many ways that I am not sure I am good enough to express each and every one of them. First of all, anyone who gave 1-5 star to this movie, really?! Go see some chick flicks and entertain yourselves. This movie is absolutely not for such people.
Secondly, J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller were so good that I cannot decide which one is the best and the other follows so this movie, as in its original story has two marvelous characters played by most talented actors, one junior and one senior and they deliver and convey every single note of this story perfectly. They actually painted a very difficult yet beautiful ""The Master and his student, meant to be one soon"" story for us in this film.
Yes, the scenes were pretty rough, I did not like them either. There are some disturbing scenes and yes, there is certainly abuse, both verbal and physical in the relationships between Fletcher and his students but that's all about folks. This movie intends to make us see that either you take everything and endure to become perfect in this life or you simply submit to loose. As Andrew says: ""I do not want to be great. I wanna be one of the greats"". If you just aim to be one great person, find a cuddly thoughtful teacher and dance with him/her. If you want to become legend, find a legendary master who takes no sh.t from you whatsoever. That is the only way you will be molded and become a dazzling sculpture out of an amorph piece of stone.This story tells us that being one in a crowd is no different than being one of the billions of ants in millions of ant colonies and this feeling is the worst a human being may experience. To be nothing is pure suffering and most painful than what you need to cope with in order to chase your dreams. This movie teaches us that giving up should not be an option. Only the best of the best remain and only their names are remembered forever and a human life is worthwhile when this kind of rare miracle happens. Other than that, well most other things are just huge waste of time and energy, sort of. Yeah yeah I know, hard to admit but get over it!So what, alrighty, great musicians, artists etc die younger, some of them at least, what a shame. However the decision also has been translated to us with the words of Andrew: I'd rather be dead 34 year old, drunk and junkie and someone to be mentioned in a dinner table than be alive until 90 years old, sober and someone that nobody remembers my name"". Andrew knows his passion was consuming but he did not yield. He did not cede. He did not give up. That's how he won in the end because Andrew knew that being eternal, being immortal only happens when you never cede and this movie is based on that. A dedication and sacrifice can make you...perhaps happy but other than that, there is no solution.Obviously, anyone can choose to be ordinary and be content of this choice in their lives and we should not be judgemental about their decisons but then these people must keep themselves in check in order not to whine about not living a fulfilling life, not chasing their dreams and disappoint themselves in the end or else. They are not allowed smearing good talented people who may become best of the best by sweat, tears and blood. 
Some of the reviewers accused this movie as Hollywood junk but it is the opposite of it. It tells us that being famous is not the point. Being eternal is. And to be eternal, to write your name in the history of any kind of art, science takes too much effort and then some. A flame, a drive, ambition and courage. Devotion to yourself and your purpose. This is not everyone's cup of tea ladies and gentlemen. That's why we meet just a couple of hundreds of names in acting, music, painting or else among millions thoughout hundreds of years and that's why we are thrilled, inspired and fascinated by these people since these people happen very rare in our dull meaningless lives. We feel good just being witness of their amaze. We do not forget them ever.
 
I am definitely not a kind of person who is easily moved by fame or prosperity but I am bowing in front of every genuine talent and this movie reminds me how these rare talented people rise up from the worthless crowds. Just like Fletcher says: you have to believe that you have a reason to be here. Another point of the movie, sort of sideway but it is there, so yes, the story is also about that: you should find your own cause, a reason, full confidence of your calling to live a life worthwhile. If a person is strong enough, substantial, hard working, not a quitter, then you can understand that, this individual is also clever and whole enough to decide what his/her calling is. This kind of wholeness deserves respect. Also when Fletcher said to Andrew not to worry about the scales, numbers and what other people think but do what you do, we can see it in the last scene of the movie that, a priceless lesson was finally learned by Andrew, from his master whom he already betrayed for no reason but in the end, the greatest praise was the smile and appreciation in that same master's eyes whom he betrayed. Nonetheless he was forgiven which is a big accomplishment and that smile was the one Andrew was seeking in his whole life, not from anyone else including his weak father. He played the drums like nothing else was more important than that in this world and that's when he reached to a point of delivering a phenomenal peerless solo and that was what Fletcher wanted him to figure out.In some reviews, apparently from people who did not understand a thing from this movie accused the character of Fletcher by being only an abusing, self-important teacher with no legit reason. On the contrary, he was such a solid character who knew what he knew, what his purpose in this life was and he was not apologising for pushing his students because what he believed was actually just like a paper which works for seperating acid from base. That's how you eliminate really good talented people who would take everything to be one of greats or just above mediocre and Fletcher did not have time and energy for mediocre. Indeed, as we can see him playing the piano peacefully in a jazz bar just for sole purpose of pleasure indicated us that he was not such a horrible person. He was sort of a broken man himself. In one of earlier scenes, in fact he sincerely cried for the loss of one of his former students who became a beautiful musician, his words for God's sake, pay some attention guys! These lines are defining the excellence of this marvellous story and movie.When Andrew had an accident and still arrived in the music hall but rejected by Fletcher, I am sure everyone got angry. Well, I am looking from a different perspective: Fletcher warned all the musicians in the band to take at least two hours ahead for possible traffic issues before going to the place where the music event would occur which Andrew did not obey. He also forgot his sticks since he was in a rush which was a huge mistake. And also Fletcher tried to teach him a lesson that sometimes, a person's passion, eagerness would cloud the rational judgement but not everything is about you so you should also be a team player and think about other players first but Andrew was becoming blind because of his obsession and he was not thinking properly. It was a harsh lesson alright but most of the good lessons are.
So, short russian of this movie: No extraordinary success, fulfillment and happiness can find you without enormous amount of pain because being one in a million should not be that easy. And I wish this movie was made 20 years ago cause my life could have been totally different but then, director of this movie was three years old, lol. I tbelieve if you want to make a decision in life, you should first watch this special movie.And of course uncountable kudos to Damien Chazelle, a thrilling master indeed who made this movie possible. Thank you Mr. Chazelle, many respects and admiration to you from my humble heart. At this very young age of yours, you have figured it out all!I am taking away one star because other than Simmons, Teller and Reiser (he was protraying a wobbling father figure marvelously) unfortunately the other cast members were unbelievably poor but cinema is a team game too so good job for them. On the other hand, I am standing on my feet and applauding these three top notch actors whose names mentioned above since they have done their jobs flawlessly. I believe this is a kind of movie in cinema history that would never be forgotten by so many film lovers and high quality audience."
" Not as far wrong as people seem to think
",2018-04-02 00:00:00,10,"Minor spoilers
I know there are already plenty of reviews for this film, but a lot of the low scores are from people who say they don't believe the very premise of the story.
I have also studied music. In fact, I am also a drummer. Music school wasn't like this for me, but high school really was. I was never physically struck, but the threat of it was real enough, and the humiliation suffered in front of the other musicians was traumatic and the memory is painful enough more than 30 years later now that this was a hard movie to watch and yet I couldn't look away. This was so close to what I went through in high school that I would easily believe it if someone were to tell me that my high school band career was the source material.
J.K. Simmons, amazing in everything, was easily as good here and I could only wish that I could have had the strength of character and self confidence that Miles Teller's character demonstrates in this film. I loved the relationship he has with his father (pleasant surprise performance by Paul Reiser), but the general lack of support from a family that mostly doesn't understand his dream is also totally believable and is pretty common for musicians from a non-musical family. This was one of my favorite movies in a while. I just kept yelling at the screen, ""I KNOW!! Right???"" See this movie, and BELIEVE it."
" Not quite my tempo
",2018-04-01 00:00:00,4,"The performances and direction (which earned all my 4 stars) could have made this a great film, but the message conveyed by the storyline was repellent. I watched right to the end, waiting for the dark consequences of the conductor's behaviour, but instead the film validated the abuse."
" A strong story, very well acted
",2018-03-18 00:00:00,9,"This is one of those films that equals the hype. Just J.K. Simmons alone makes it worth the time, but Miles Teller also breaks out as a bonafide star also. The themes will resonate with anyone who has cared about something so much they'll put up with almost anything do get it. It's excruciating at times, but always with a payoff."
" Mindset-changing
",2018-03-15 00:00:00,10,"To what extent can you immerse yourself in what you do, in order to reach perfection? How far can you go without breaking?
And more importantly: should you go that far?This is a story of an extremely harsh mentor and extremely determined apprentice. Two giants, meeting face to face in order to reach perfection.The conductor's (Fletcher) position is to ""push people beyond what's expected of them"". He believes that to be ""an absolute necessity"", a Legend Recipe. For him, ""There are no two words in the English language more harmful than ""good job"".The drummer's (Andrew) position is to ""...rather die drunk, broke at 34 and have people at a dinner table talk about me (him) than live to be rich and sober at 90 and nobody remembered who I (he) was.""I find that movie highly motivating, especially for people who play an instrument themselves.*SPOILERS
There's also:
*great jazz
*either rushing or dragging (I don't really know)
*flying chairs
*deliberate sabotage of the band
*no Mars-bars down there
*being upset
*bloody drum-kits
And more!QI:I think there should be a whole new language rating system created, just so that movie can be on top, cause ""18+"" definitely doesn't cut it.J.K. Simmons (Fletcher) won an Oscar for his outstanding performance. Oddly enough, his speech didn't include any swear words."
" Amazing! An instant classic!
",2018-03-14 00:00:00,10,"Not knowing anything about Damien Chazelle prior to seeing this when it came out allowed me to have very little expectations going into it. Boy was I impressed. After La La Land, it's clear Chazelle is one of the best new directors out there. It's hard to imagine that a movie about a competitive Jazz school could be as suspenseful as this. Teller is terrific and clearly a skilled drummer in his own right. J.K. Simmons' performance is one of the most deserved Academy Award winning performances in a decade. I still remember both my brother and I letting out a deep breathe after one particularly tense scene between Simmons and Teller. If you have not seen this Jazz masterpiece, add it to your WatchList ASAP!"

" Blood, sweat and tears.
",2018-03-08 00:00:00,8,"WHIPLASH is directed by Damien Chazelle and stars lead actor Miles Teller and supporting actor J.K. Simmons. The story is about Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller), an aspiring drummer who is discovered by Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), a highly praised conductor of a jazz band. Fletcher invites Andrew to his class after hearing him play. While in the band Andrew discovers how Fletcher teaches his musicians with what some would see it as, abuse (Mostly mental abuse but also physical as one might understand from one scene in the film).Blood, sweat and tears. This ancient saying is visually symbolized in the film. WHIPLASH tells about the struggle in the path to success. Andrew is constantly abused by Fletcher who believes that it is necessary to push his musicians to the very edge for them to become great musicians. It's better explained by a quote from Fletcher himself: ""There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job"". The film also confronts all the sacrifice that is required to reach greatness. Andrew spends hours upon hours, days upon days, practicing his drumming skills. He breaks up with his girlfriend who he believes will slow him down in his path to success. He even gets in a car crash and is injured but immediately gets up to walk right up to his show.The ending scene in this film is perfect (As so many others also believe). After being confronted by Fletcher who knew about Andrew being the one who caused Fletcher to be removed from the Shaffer conservatory, Andrew gets embarrassed by Fletcher in probably the biggest moment of his career. After this Andrew walks out of the stage and then suddenly, something changes his mind. He is willing to give it all he's got before leaving music. He is willing to take that extra step that others might not do. Andrew walks back in and starts playing the drums. After a while Fletcher realizes that this is the moment, the moment in which a great artist could be born. And remember, as mentioned in one scene in this film, Fletcher never had ""the next Louis Armstrong"". He saw this as a great opportunity for him. So, he leads him in the defining moment and at the very end gives him a subtle smile of approval as to finally say: Good job.Young and talented director, Damien Chazelle, has created an amazing film with A CRAP TON OF INTENSITY AND SUSPENSE, which I believe is rare for music-themed films. The performances Miles Teller and J..K. Simmons are STUNNING. After watching this film it's hard to imagine anyone else playing the role of these two characters. The cinematography is incredible, the editing is PERFECT (especially in the ending sequence). While there is so much more to speak up and discuss about this film I'll settle with saying that this is one of my personal favorites of 2014 and I hope that Damien Chazelle keeps making breath-taking films for audiences to see like this one."
" Great movie!!

" In 1 word... Orgasmic

Exciting, passionating, orgasmic !"
" Whiplash is a modern day masterpiece.
",2018-03-02 00:00:00,10,"I don't say that often, in fact...never. There aren't enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash. Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema, but a thematic experience with layered subtext. Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer. Terence Fletcher, a renowned teacher at said college, sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band, at the expense of emotional distress. This is a brutal character study, absolutely savage. This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew. The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows. I've never been so compelled in a drama ever (and this is my 5th viewing). The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be. The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession, there is no right or wrong way to achieve this; the question is: ""is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them?"". Fletcher leans towards the latter, so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not. The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed, you can see his passion seeping through the blood, sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher's methods. A simple story, but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh. Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this. Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J.K Simmons duelling in anger. Speaking on Simmons, the best performance I've seen in years. Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously, he deserved every award. Teller was near perfect as well, conveying innocence and vulnerability. Look, I can talk about Whiplash forever. It's a masterpiece. End of review."
" Good Job
",2018-02-22 00:00:00,10,"Andrew (Miles Teller) wants to be a drummer. Not just any drummer, but the best. One that will be remembered. He attends a music conservatory which features an instructor (J.K. Simmons) that makes most drill sergeants look like a wet-nurse. Andrew worships this man and wants to play for him. At home he has successful brothers at college and must compete for attention at the dinner table in spite of any accomplishment doing the ""drumming thing.""It is an odd film where the instructor is the antagonist. It takes an hour and 10 minutes to build character and take us to the point where the plot suddenly turns into what seems to be a different film.The film has a great climax which supplies us with no closure. The acting jobs were great which took a story about a kid who wants to slap sticks against mylar into an Oscar winner.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" A real disappointment
",2018-02-21 00:00:00,1,"How did this film get 3 oscar ... I still wonder.
Without a story, if not that of a guy who thinks he's becoming a drummer with speed sessions, (which does not express a true drummer) just to please a psycho-sadist what it's actually playing. Not the technique but the transport that can give during the execution of a piece. Plotty and barren in history. A film that I discourage everyone, unless you want to stop playing definitely. I do not say this out of anger towards a bad ""master"" (Hartman), on the contrary, that was the most interesting part (not to fall asleep). Appointing a Rich Buddy without mentioning a Gene Krupa ... another serious mistake. in short, a flop!"

" Icarus with melting wings
",2018-02-13 00:00:00,9,"Let´s think together: to what extent human beings can go to achieve greatness in a craft? I am not talking about a search for happiness, flowing, and connection. Crossing history since Icarus, to be a human being is also dreaming with a power to take things suspended for a moment or to run the show and the attention for while. This film shows what ambition can make to those who want to pay the price of it. The screenplay brings a music student and his terrible mentor, one that is looking for a new Icarus. Humiliating his students taking them to the limits of sanity that's the price his students pay to make him feel great again. Charlie Park, the bird, is used by the teacher as the perfect student, the role model, that could bare everything because a genius never give up this talent. Even with the sun meltings the glue which makes wings attached to his body, Icarus continue to go up. This film is about a musical dream of flying high melting ambitions."

" Stunning story of ambition, pushing limitations, and moral ambiguity.
",2018-01-31 00:00:00,10,"Andrew Neimann, a first year student at a prestigious music academy. He is a loner who has seemingly sacrificed a social life in pursuit of his dream of becoming the next Buddy Rich.
He struggles in relationships with both males in his band class, and with a girl who he deems a distract in his pursuit of greatness.
His father criticizes Andrew for not pursuing a more safe and stable profession and sees drumming as an unrealistic career path. This only pushes Andrew further to prove him wrong.
Professor Terence Fletcher sees something in Andrew and promotes him to the most prestigious band at Schaffer Conservatory, which fletcher conducts. He pushes Andrew to his limits, getting his hopes up, then tearing them down and verbally beating him until Andrew reaches Fletcher's arbitrary, knowingly unrealistic goals. 
Andrew punishes himself physically, drumming or listening to tapes every waking hour and living with his drums trying to reach the goals that may vary well be unattainable, unless he gets the approval of Fletcher.
Fletcher also faces legal pressure due to one of his former students having committed suicide, which may not be the first case of this happening to a student of his. Fletcher is devastated after he hears of the death of his former student, who was his most successful one.
Fletcher and Andrew coming together is a perfect storm. Andrew wants to be the absolute best, and Fletcher wants to teach the one who become's the absolute best. They both are willing to go to extreme lengths to accomplish these goals.
Fletcher is deliberately provocative to Andrew and finally pushes him too far, kicking him out of the orchestra. After Andrew attacks Fletcher, he is pursued by a lawyer who is building a case against Fletcher for his possible abuse of students. 
Unwilling at first, Andrew eventually complies after pressure from his father and provides testimony which leads to Fletcher being fired from Schaffer.
Not knowing Fletcher is aware of the betrayal, Fletcher convinces Andrew to fill in for a drummer in a show he is doing. He lies to Andrew about the music being played and embarrasses him in front of very important agents in the orchestral music industry. Andrew realizes what he must do and takes the stage over and Fletcher realizes that Andrew is indeed the one student prodigy he was hoping for.The characters are so gripping and the tragedy and triumph are what makes the movie truly amazing."
" A movie all about music for those that understand it
",2018-01-21 00:00:00,7,"A budding jazz pianist (Miles Teller) is admitted into the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory where he comes under the eye of the legendary Terence Fletcher (J. K. Simmons), who promptly starts driving him like a dog, trying to take him as far beyond his human limits as possible.Frankly speaking, movies about music have never been my thing. I'm in no way musically talented or inclined, and thus whenever, for example, there's that one scene where someone has to play something over and over again, getting yelled at the same time to get it right, until it finally goes, it just doesn't open up to me. Every single take sounds the same. Might be that that's the purpose, but I do believe that you're meant to hear the subtle differences if you're good enough.And in that regard I don't think Whiplash has what it takes to take someone on a journey into the world of music. A movie about war, for example, can show you what it would be like to be there on the battlefield. But then that's explicitly what it is trying to do. Whereas Whiplash seems to be about music made by those that get it to those that also get it.Luckily music is only half of the movie. The second big theme is greatness and what is needed to achieve it. Because it cannot be just about raw talent. Every day a person is born with the capability to become a great musician. But few of them end up in the business and only a few of those have the drive needed to urge them onward even when they've already achieved some measure of success.Whiplash is a fine film. Personally I didn't find it as compelling as it probably is to so many others, but I can definitely recognize talent, heart and soul when I see it."
" This movie is just BRIL-LIANT
",2018-01-17 00:00:00,10,"Amazing movie.
Well played.
Very very good.Loved the ending"
" Great
",2018-01-15 00:00:00,9,"I don't love jazz much but this movie I love. A story about the fine line between passion and madness, about freedom through commitment. Great movie. Great acting. Like Black Swan a fine movie about art and being an artist and the sacrifices it takes."
" Amazing
",2018-01-08 00:00:00,9,"Whiplash is not a movie about drums or music.It's film about dreams, goals, persistence, will, power.This movie shows us that nothing will come to you and you have to fight for something you believe for something that you deserve.Whiplash is the message for everyone who learns, who dreams to become SOMEONE.Whiplash is also a message for everyone who gives up on his dreams, for everyone who fights with depression or anxiety.
This is modest but impeccable story about not that perfect youngster, 
 even more, he is in some moments arrogant, selfish, too proud youngster, but he is a youngster who doesn't give up.He pushes himself over the limits of his physical and mental state, so he could fulfil his dream, to become the best drummer in the world. His road to becoming best starts when he joins student bend of mentor Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). I watched J.K.Simmons only in OZ where he was the leader of an Arian group in Oswald Prison.He was brilliant there, brilliant and here he is even better.AMAZING ACTING
That connection of Flecther and Andrew ( Miles Teller, main character) shows us fight for the dream of Andrew. Fletcher with his learning methods leads to mental problems of his students , but our main character is persistent. In his dream, but also in every other, there will be people which will interrupt it, because they are people with their dreams, with their story. I'm really familiar with this and that just gives me a whole picture of the mental state of the main character.
Mentor, Fletcher, is an artist and nothing below that.A perfect written character with outbursts of rage, instability and vocabulary which does not suit the professor.But every man who looks outside of the box must respect his work because he tries to push his students in pain, blood, tears and success.
Fletcher and Andrew - duo that's opposite but with the same goal - success and success.Great story and my recommendation9,5/10"
" Utter nonsense
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,1,"I'm halfway through this film and don't think I've ever seen such a load of utter nonsense. As a professional musician myself, it couldn't be less realistic in my experience. Whilst some of the themes ring true, it's otherwise a totally false picture of life at a music conservatoire and the music business, and I don't think I can bring myself to even bother watching the rest of it! AVOID!"
" Intense !
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,9,"Not what you'd think from a story about a drummer with only two main characters. Both characters are described in much detail without any word of mouth needed, it's all shown through camera angles, lighting, costume and props. every little detail is thought about and the contrast between the two characters who are at constant conflict really make in for a story that can really suck you in and make you feel part of the movie and connect with the characters. This connection wouldn't have been possible if it wasn't for the outstanding acting of Miles Teller and J.K Simmons."
" Good
",2017-12-28 00:00:00,8,Needed more action like the Fast and the Furious. Thank you for reading this and hope you have a great day. Peace out.
" What a Final
",2017-12-28 00:00:00,10,This masterpiece demonstrates that passion can control people.Moreover it lets us see 2 passionate people crashing due to their obsessions about their passions.
" Unrealistic, unapologetic, and absolutely entrancing
",2017-12-26 00:00:00,7,"Are the two most dangerous words in the English language ""good job?"" Is greatness worth the price/push? That's what Whiplash asks. It does so in a pretty cheesy and unrealistic fashion. It fails. It falls. But it tries and will not apologize for it."
" Hard to watch but worth it.
",2017-12-26 00:00:00,10,"This is easily on of my favorite movies. Yes it is hard how the main character is treated, yes the teacher, (played amazingly by J.K Simmons), is a very hard teacher and I of course do not like his method of teaching, but I, as a musician (or at least a singer), understand what he is trying to say.
I have been in many bands, no professional, mostly wedding bands and in bands playing other peoples music, but if anyone think that even amateur bands, as the ones I have been playing in, is not a cutthroat business they are wrong. People get fired from bands every day. In the bands that I have been in, I have both fired and been fired from bands, simply because either I or some other member was not good enough.
Every band wants to be the best they can be and if that means that they have to be mean and fire someone and I knew that if I did not do my absolutely best, I could be the one that was fired.Let's look at this movie in another light, let's say that it was a movie about American football or any other sport. Any coach wants his team to give 110% each and every time so they can win the championship and the athletes would know that that was what is expected of them. If they do not do their absolute best, there will be someone else to take over, because there is always someone that wants to be better that you. J.K Simmons is that coach, he is hard, he goes too far, but he does it because he is passionate for the music and wants to be the one that finds the next big thing and that is the same as most football coaches wants, they want to find the next Peyton Manning and the players want that too, like the musicians in this movie wants to be the next Charlie Parker or Buddy Rich.I dare anyone that thinks that this movie is unrealistic, to look at their own life and think what would happen if they did not do their best at their job, would your boss say ""that is okay"" or would your boss in time find someone that could do the job better than you.You may not like the characters in this movie, I personally found it hard to like any of them, except Melissa Benoist (who played Nicole), but I understand their passion and this movie did an amazing job showing what it takes to be a professional person."
" AMAZING!!
",2017-12-24 00:00:00,8,"Andrew (Miles Teller) is 19-year old student at a music conservatory in Manhattan. Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) is a teacher at the conservatory with a ruthlessly brutal teaching style. After picking Andrew to play in the school band, he pushes Andrew to his limits in order to realize his full potential, at the risk of his humanity.Porweful film. You must see it."
" Flawless
",2017-12-20 00:00:00,10,"Incredibly well acted and edited, emotional, and showing themes of love, abuse, commitment, and mental health; this movie is flawless. Movie and music lovers will absolutely appreciate this work of art for what it is... a masterpiece.
I simply can't get enough of this film, and believe it isn't as popular as it deserves to be. I could truly watch this a hundred times before its powerful story gets boring. Please watch for an incredibly compelling story that will be hard to forget."
" A film also to be seen by who is seeking a Ph.D. or a Master's degree
",2017-12-17 00:00:00,10,"Whiplash is an amazing film on the relationship between a professor and a student. Such emotional attachment can be a wonderful or a hellish experience, without not being always possible to clearly grasp if the advisor is supportive, neutral or even a rival. This doubt is dealt in the film with a great script, a fantastic director, and wonderful actors."
" See it. Think about it. Repeat.
",2017-12-17 00:00:00,10,It's grown on me over the years. This is a perfect movie.
" Terence Fletcher: I was there to push people beyond what's expected of them. I believe that's an absolute necessity.
",2017-11-29 00:00:00,3,"Dreams of becoming the great jazz drummer seem bring Andrew (Miles Teller) to the prestigious east coast conservatory where he catches attention of the celebrated but fearsome instructor and conductor Terence Fletcher (J. K. Simmons), who invited Andrew to join the school jazz band.Critics and viewers alike praise Whiplash to the high heaven. It was nominated for five Oscars including Best picture and received three, with predictable best supporting role award for J.K Simmons as evil sadistic manipulative bully-jazz band conductor who thrives on terrorizing the students players, especially the main character, Andrew. It is not very often that my opinion about a movie would differ completely from the public opinion but the only impression I got in the end of the often-unwatchable Whiplash, that it proves an old joke: the best marriage is between a sadist and a masochist. They both get what they need but why has the viewer to suffer? The movie is not very long and acting by J. K. Simmons and Miles Teller is excellent, - intense and selfless, but it is essentially the scene after scene of never stopping verbal, mental and physical abuse that take place during the student jazz orchestra rehearsals for upcoming competition. More than anything, it brings to mind the first half of Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket with J. K. Simmons' Fletcher making Gny. Sgt. Hartman very jealous. While the Kubrick's movie was hard to watch, it was believable and true to the logic of the characters and the situations. The jazz boot camp in the prestigious music conservatory does not ring true neither as a realistic character study of obsession and pushing the limits in the pursuit of getting the dreams come true nor as an allegory of pure evil causing something good happen.The film director/screenwriter Damien Chazelle based Whiplash on his own teenage experience as a member of the high school jazz band with very strict instructor but he did not want to make a realistic film. He wanted to carry on screen the feeling of dread that has haunted him for many years. Early on Chazelle gave Simmons direction that ""I want you to take it past what you think the normal limit would be"" telling him ""I don't want to see a human being on-screen anymore. I want to see a monster, a gargoyle, an animal."" Chazelle exorcised his own demons and most certainly succeeded in creating a pure evil. Yes, Simmons has never been better but what is the point of film? By pushing so much further, making Simmons' character a monster of manipulation, hatred and sadism, Chazelle stripped the film of humanity, of joy that creativity and music offer. It leads to a loss of interest in what was happening on the screen and looks more and more like a very bad dream or illustration in the psychiatry textbook. To call this movie ""inspiring"" is an insult to creative artistic people and their instructors, mentors, teachers. What could it possibly inspire?"
" Pure Cinema
",2017-11-26 00:00:00,10,"That's what we expect from an art called ""cinema""! Story, Performance, Editing, Music and everything is just great! Thank you J.K. Simmons for this outstanding acting. Tom Cross you nailed it. Every single cut does its own impact on story. After watching short film that Damien did a year before the feature length, you can see the same energy and strength in storytelling of course much improved. At the beginning I thought I'll be watching a musician rocky like thing, but it's completely different."
" Breathtaking and inspirational !
",2017-11-20 00:00:00,9,"It is surely one of the rare movies that succeed on almost every level, starting with the great performance by the actors,the stunning work Damien Chazelle has made.. I found this movie one of the best musical and drama movies ever, because this wasn't just an ordinary movie , it was simply a piece of art, in this movie you feel the emotions , and the ambition to reach your goal no matter the difficulties ... Neiman , a talented drummer who joins an academy to improve himself in order to reach greatness, but his dream is controlled by a harsh instructor who doesn't tolerate any mistake. JK Simmons did an amazing performance , and deserved the Oscar award for the best performance in a supporting role ! The sound editing was marvelous , you feel each and every musical instrument when the musicians start playing ! Miles Teller ... who played (Neiman) was actually a real drummer! Neiman showed us how to overcome pain to reach your aim .. When you dedicate your life for a purpose , you won't stop when you're tired,you stop when you're done... We should thank Damien Chazelle for letting us live inside this film and enjoy every scene of it, and learn many lessons that change our mentalities ."
" To be focused to achieve your goals
",2017-11-12 00:00:00,8,"From a struggle to an applause.Lots of things to talk about this movie is watched. The way the characters are captured is like you can't see a third person getting in the picture. It was fun to watch J.K. Simmons, he looks the perfect coach.Rather being friendly, he is the perfect.To achieve anything discipline is the attribute that one should really follow. That has been shown clearly. Well, coming to Teller he just gave a remarkable effort my going into character. I would say the audience to just watch the film rather looking in the review."
" About the movie
",2017-11-09 00:00:00,10,I absolutely loved the movie. It was excellent. Damien Chazelle was really brilliant. Tom Cross editing was amazing. I really loved the editing in the movie and the music was another reason why to love this movie. I am a fan of musical movies and that gives me one more reason why to watch this movie as many times as I wish.
" An excellent piece of thinking.
",2017-10-30 00:00:00,10,"This movie shows how far a teacher can go teach his student. At some point of time student may think that the teacher is some psycho but he is not. This movie tells us that there is no limit for a teacher to teach his student, if the student wants to be the greatest. Andrew a young drummer wants to be one of the best drummer of all time and his mentor Mr. Fletcher goes beyond all the boundaries to make Andrew realize his true potential."
" A creditable achievement of the goal to be one of the greatest... or not?
",2017-10-28 00:00:00,8,"A story of a persistent nineteen-year-old boy and a teacher who is close to madness. Was it just a normal Fletcher's behaviour dependent on his momentary impulses or a tight-knit plan of making Andrew a great drummer? And if the second answer is right why this plan included so many dangerous moments? Fletcher likes to repeat an old story about novice Charlie Parker, who was nearly decapitated by a cymbal that Jo Jones threw at him. As we see, Fletcher shows a similar intimidation, but the first situation was only a legend and we can't say the same in Fletcher's case. (What if Andrew hadn't dodged the cymbal?) However these two characters turned out to be ""tailor-made for each other"" (as Damien Chazelles himself said) and the plot becomes a story of their confrontation. Andrew winds up getting into a lather and refusing all moments that aren't connected with jazz. So how can we spot it? A creditable achievement of the goal to be one of the greatest or just the influence of humiliation by passionate teacher? ""Whiplash"" stirs up a lot of controversies. The only thing we can say for sure - it's a really sincere and thought-provoking film, because it's a story based on Chazelles' own impressions and doubts."
" What success actually looks like.
",2017-10-22 00:00:00,8,"It's pretty remarkable that Whiplash has more blood in it than a lot of action movies. That fact alone is an indicator that this is not an ordinary film. The relationship between Andrew and Fletcher is a sharp contrast to the ""no child left behind/ everybody wins"" mentality that millennials have been raised on. Based on this film, it's hard to say where Damien Chazelle stands on that sort of education tactic, but he gives us a ride of a story based on the inverse mentality.The characters in this movie go to extreme lengths to achieve their goals. Andrew practically ruins his life in order to become ""one of the greats"". It seems like he succeeds at the end, but I wasn't really happy for him. I don't think the sacrifice he put in was worth it and his pursuit of his passion turns him into an unfriendly person. Nonetheless, I believed that his passion was strong enough that he would forsake all personal safety in order to keep his place in Fletcher's band. This was one of the last movies I would have ever expected to feature a car crash, but I believed that it could have happened given the circumstances. Fletcher somehow didn't seem legitimate, though. He sort of told Andrew his intentions straight away, which I thought made a lot of his threats rather empty. Some of the language in the movie didn't feel realistic either. I never hear people use the F word as a noun in real life, so it made some of the dialogue in the movie feel fake. The script wasn't bad in my opinion, but not good enough to get a nomination for best screenplay. There were a few scenes that I didn't find contributed anything. Damien Chazelle showed a lot more prowess as a director than a writer in this movie. At least, that's what I thought. I wouldn't say it's a must-see, unless you are an aspiring director. The acting performances are pretty good, but not the most impressive I've seen. It's definitely an interesting take on the journey to success and the sacrifice that is involved, and is more likely to discourage people to achieve greatness than to inspire them. It's definitely an intense movie, not that entertaining, but it will keep your attention. Overall Rating: 8.1/10."
" A rare gem.
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,10,"Movies are a lot like music. They require an ensemble of different instruments and talented artists to achieve a polished result. ''Whiplash' a thrilling low budget diamond in the rough, is a story about an ambitious young jazz drummer, Miles Teller, and his terrifying instructor, JK Simmons, as director Damien Chazelle whips up an aggressive, drama fueled symphony that could go down as 2014's most surprising movie. Not much is known of Damien Chazelle except that he has natural flair for the obscene and obscure, as the music room slowly turns into a torture chamber. Andrew Neyman, a student borderline obsessed with mastering the fine art of drumming. His soft and naive nature is pure cannon fodder for the volatile and barbarous Mr Fletcher, a character that cares solely for his orchestra and brutally discards anyone who dares tamper with it. As we see Andrew's relentless drive toward Fletcher's pursuit of nail biting perfection and approval, the film and its character's reach a primal arena reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket'. To say'Whiplash' is one of the years best films may be a stretch, but no-one can deny its entertaining and ferocious brilliance, pushed to the absolute limit by Simmon's charismatic presence. I look forward to Damien Chazelle's next installment."
" what a treat
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,9,This is a physiological movie that puts you on a roller-coaster. This movie gets more intense and grows with twists intertwined in the story. There are only a few songs in this movie and that's needed because it makes you really appreciate what musicians put into their craft. J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller are fantastic together. Damien Chazelle brought a great story and managed to inspire those who have dreams have to work hard to achieve it. The imagery and cinematography allow the story to be told with less dialogue and make the audience feel the emotions of Andrew during this trial as well as absolutely fear Terrence Fletcher. I would watch this movie again and again.
" A film with impact
",2017-10-17 00:00:00,9,"A thrilling drama about perseverance, grit and insanity more than about music starring Miles Teller as Andrew Neiman, a student of New-York's best music academy, and J.K.Simmons as his wayward tyrant-teacher Fletcher. These two people tailor-made for each other will stop at nothing to achieve their goals and it's really amusing to watch the fight, the competition between them. This is also a philosophical film, which does make you think a lot about eternal values of our life. Love or dream? Life or fame? The main character Andrew Neiman made his choice. Again, it's a psychological movie rather than a musical. You just can't sit still because of excitement and strain bursting out. Although I couldn't see the character's great love for music, I recommend ""Whiplash"" for the inspiration and 1.5 hours of enjoyment it gave me."
" «The road to greatness can take you to the edge»
",2017-10-17 00:00:00,7,"Do you like films about the purposeful people who know what they want to achieve? Do you like movies about the men who overcome obstacles? If you say «yes», «Whiplash» is for you. The tagline of it is «The road to greatness can take you to the edge». This movie is a musical drama that depicts Andrew Neyman (the character of Miles Teller). He is a young jazz drummer and a student of the tony Shaffer Conservatory in Manhattan. He wants to be like his idol in drumming Buddy Rich. We can hear steady tap-tap-tap of a drumstick in this film because Andrew wants to improve his skill of drumming. He dreams of being great. The director of the best orchestra in the country Terence Fletcher notices Andrew. Fletcher wants to find greatness. He begins to train Andrew in drumming. And he uses cruel methods to do it. He throws chairs, slaps Andrew and other students and screams insults about their parentage. Fletcher tells Andrew that the worst thing you can tell a young artist is «Good job» as self- satisfaction and complacency are the enemies of artistic progress. I don't agree with this opinion. I am absolutely sure that every trainer should brace up and encourage young talents to give motivation to go on and to achieve the goals. Due to cruelty a man can get upset and give up even if he has a great purpose. I personally think that physical brutality is not always a good way to motivate somebody. Very often we can achieve more by encouraging people. Speaking about Andrew he becomes obsessive. He drums his hands bloody into the night to be worthy of Fletcher's tempo. Andrew wants to earn the approval of Fletcher and show him what he can. At the end of the movie he shows Fletcher that his drumming and playing a gig is perfect. This film is about the abuse of power. It is about an achievement- oriented and conscientious person. It is about drumming perfection and overcoming oneself. The main character has a crazy desire to be great. Despite the pain, the cruelty and blood he achieves his aim. Is violence necessary for high achievement? Everyone decides for themselves. I believe that this method is not always good. Besides, this film is about the battle between two strong men. Who is the winner for you? I really liked this movie. «Whiplash» is worth watching at least in order to hear a perfectly steady tap-tap-tap of a drumstick and enjoy excellent jazz music."
" Push It To The Limit
",2017-10-17 00:00:00,9,"Whiplash is unrelenting and single-minded in its focus, and all the better for it. This could've easily backfire with other films if there are certain elements of the movie that feel undeveloped. Yet, this movie purposely sidesteps this by using it in service of the movie's narrowing conflict and its intensity. Consider how the movie's romance between the main character and his love interest seems tacked on and ends in a giant halt. From the main character's perspective, it's the ambition, the obsession, the sacrifices to make in achieving the all-conquering ""success"". But at what cost? Yes, the movie at the surface centers around Jazz and drumming. These are depicted through sublime film editing with rhythmic-like cuts and transitions in synchronizing with the music being played and the musician's performance themselves.But it's not the subject. It's a supplier for these themes which is executed with ferocious passion through scenes with J.K Simmons role as Fletcher. He has a screen presence that commands attention; always ready with his coiled up brutality inside of him that's waiting to be unleashed at any moment to his.Fletcher is entertaining just as he's frightening. We are not supposed to laugh at these caustic verbal abuse by Fletcher to everyone. But the brilliance of J.K Simmons performance can be summed up where he throws and hurls his insults with such biting creativity that even Gordon Ramsay might send some flowers. I guess this is the film's way in making him redeemable alongside his harsh, cold yet BELIEVABLE (key word) intentions that keep him from making the character completely insufferable.We already know Andrew is ambitious himself such as his response to lack of social interest as an obstacle, his subtle smirks in his expression whenever his drumming rivals fails and his condescending remarks in the dinner scene. And yet, the main relationship of the movie is between the main character, Andrew and Fletcher which is clearly abusive and toxic. It's curious to see how over the course of the movie, the main character, Andrew, slowly becomes a reflection (or product) of Fletcher in matching his menacingly perfectionist ideal.It's bewildering that with Whiplash's premise, it can generate such intensity and ferocity where every musicians are performing as if their life is on the line; camera close-up shots continually focus on their hands trembling, sweats all over them. Even most action movies that's more advantageous in generating these emotions, don't match Whiplash's emotional impact."
" The story about unbreakable faith
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,9,"Whiplash is a film that I wanted to watch long time ago but, unfortunately, there was always lack of time. And so finally my life gave me a chance to do it. And now I can say that it's really such kind of movie that should appear on your way at exactly needed time.Whiplash is an American musical drama film written and directed by Damien Chazelle, very young and talented screenwriter and producer who is also famous with his work La La Land. As always, for his movie Damien Chazelle chose amazing actors that can show all little shadings of their characters. Stars of Whiplash are Miles Teller, J. K. Simmons, Paul Reiser, and Melissa Benoist.The main idea of the film was to create a battle atmosphere and show difficult relationships between very ambitious jazz student and his degrading and aggressive teacher. Watching this movie can be really compared with listening to a strong drum solo. It keeps you in suspense during the whole time. You don't know exactly how it will end and what characters really think about but you still cannot take your eyes of the screen. Everything including lighting, colors and interiors of Whiplash makes you feel the brutality of the movie.This story is about a young student of a prestigious Shaffer Conservatory in New York. Andrew Neiman is obsessed with playing drums and with his desire to become like Buddy Rich. At least he encountered with talented instructor Terence Fletcher who has his own studio band and here is where everything starts.It was a dream of Andrew to become a part of this jazz band but Fletcher's behavior with students is rather strange and frightened. He is strict and abusive. He can be really merciless towards his musicians. And it begins to be a big problem for Neiman. Although Terence always says that his way of teaching is the only chance to find real greatness and new Charlie Parker.Many times Fletcher tries to expel Andrew from the band but the boy is unbreakable. He continues fighting for his place. He plays his part even after car crash. And the more he shows his strength, the worse the Fletcher's behavior becomes.For one moment it seems that Andrew finally gives up and quits his favorite activity, he starts to think that he is really a lack of talent, especially when even problems in private life also dumps on your head. But anyhow his destiny is to become a great drummer and at the end of the film we can see how close he is to his life aim. I guess Whiplash is about indestructible will to become great, to leave a legacy in history and to reach the most impossible goals. It's about following your fate no matter what is happening around. This film is also rather thought-provoking because there are many ambiguous things. For example, the way of teaching of Terence Fletcher. I suppose that violence is not the right way to reveal a talent of a person but anyhow just because of his cruelty he was able to make Andrew step close to his dream of becoming new Buddy Rich.Yes, this movie leaves a lot of questions but it's really worth watching. For somebody it can be an amazing dose of motivation, for somebody it can be a possibility to think out his own behavior and style of life and for somebody it may be just an interesting breathtaking story about weird duet of two great people who are helping each other in a strange way. Anyhow Whiplash is a film that needs to be watched and I'm sure that it will come to your life just at the right time to show all his sense and value."
" one of the best editing movie ever
",2017-10-09 00:00:00,9,"Whiplash explodes on screen like a well-timed artillery barrage. We're introduced to the two characters in this movie that really matter in the opening scene itself. Illuminated by an overhead light, Andrew is seen practicing in an otherwise dark room at the fictional Shaffer Conservatory of Music. He picks up the tempo on the snare, gradually accelerating to a machine-gun frenzy until Fletcher walks in and Andrew abruptly halts. Their tenuous student-teacher equation begins here."
" Best film of it's year
",2017-10-09 00:00:00,8,"During the year of it's release Whiplash was up against some fierce competitors, like boyhood for example. Although Whiplash didn't get all of the awards, which it rightfully deserved in my opinion, it did get released. The performances from both Miles Teller and J.K Simmons were so powerful, topped with the intensity of those drum scenes. For someone learning how to make films, like myself. Study this one.Beautiful cinematography, amazing audio and phenomenal writing."
" Simply amazing
",2017-09-29 00:00:00,9,"A simple story taken to the maximum expression, just a different kind of movie, based on the intensity of the characters all over the changing events that happens during the film. A must-seen movie for all, as it makes you suffer the environment and the feelings of the characters. Furthermore, one of the best (if not the best) secondary role I have ever seen in my life made by an amazing J.K. Simons."
" Are you people nuts?
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,1,"Seems almost everyone likes this movie for some reason. My review will be short and sweet: This is the dumbest premise for a movie I've ever witnessed. This is ""Full Metal Jacket"" with drums. No one, and I mean NO ONE would put up with the abuse that this music teacher dishes out, unless they were in the Marine Corp. It's one thing to be a nasty music teacher, but quite another to be R. Lee Ermey as Gunny Sgt. Hartman. Every kid I know today would have pounced on Fletcher and beat him to a pulp if he acted this way towards them. I keep waiting for Andrew to turn into Pvt. Leonard 'Gomer Pyle' Lawrence with a rifle in his hand to blow the teacher away. No, this is beyond fantasy, this is just dumb."
" Loved it!
",2017-09-22 00:00:00,10,"A powerful modern take on a story which tackles humanity at its core. A film for cinema lovers and musicians alike, this film shows us a fictional take on what would be expected of a jazz musician at one of the top music schools in the USA. A story of dedication and of challenge, of adversity and very human flaws. This is a film which is beautifully shot with a brilliant soundtrack, a thing of artistic and creative vision."
" Electrifying
",2017-09-06 00:00:00,8,"My only real issue with the movie is that it sometimes spends too much time on exploring things the audience already knows, I just felt it could be more subtle at times. That being said, it has great dialogue, fantastic acting, amazing cinematography, an intriguing story, and a fantastic finale. ""Electrifying"" is the word that describes my opinion on this movie the best."
" Quite my tempo!
",2017-09-01 00:00:00,8,"Easily one of the best films in recent years. Didn't watch this film till about 8 months after it had been released; one of few films I regret not seeing at cinemas. J.K Simmons blew me away, with his abusive and profanity laden performance. For certain, one of the most deserved Oscar wins in recent time. Miles Teller, if slightly under the shadow of Simmon's performance, deserves some recognition for a stellar and solid performance, for what I'm sure is only the beginning of a number of acclaimed performances. However, the polished Writing and Directing by Damien Chazelle, made this film a fun, inspiring and breathtaking watch, that I'm sure me and lots of others will continue to watch over the years."
" Flawless
",2017-09-01 00:00:00,10,"A truly beautiful film with challenging characters, incredible performances and an extremely effective soundscape and score. Teller delivers one of the best performances I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing in a film. I have nothing bad to say about Whiplash, a marvellously engaging film."
" A real emotional ride, superbly done.
",2017-08-26 00:00:00,9,"One of the most surprisingly simple yet incredibly intense movies I can recall, with incredible acting, incredible cinematography (no wasted visual moment, just cut right to where you are meant to be for the next development, and snappy, non-typical focus). It leaves the viewer with deep questions, especially for driven people such as artists, if not everyone. It very much catches you up from the first scene, and carries you through to an ending which is emotionally satisfying yet philosophically questionable. All of this is in addition to some absolutely unbelievable drumming.To me, a perfect little powerhouse of a movie."
" for a directorial debut, this is the way to do it!
",2017-08-25 00:00:00,10,"If you've seen Full Metal Jacket, imagine ol' mild-mannered Sgt. Hartmann obsessed with molding his youngsters to a pinnacle jazz musician (he may be irreligious too, but the Virgin Mary ain't ever there to dump on him about it). Terence Fletcher (played by J.K. Simmons) is this unwavering perfectionist with a special fondness for one Andrew Neiman (played by Miles Teller). The significance of the father character is easy to dismiss on the first viewing, but he does well in complimenting Neiman's dedicated practicing to mold his drumming skills into something Fletcher might someday deem praise- worthy. Very few storytelling dichotomies nowadays get as compelling as this, and the immense tension which stirs between them feeds into an unforgettable, yet pleasantly unexpected climax. While Neiman's flaws are very present and almost unshakeable, they're more indicative of how talented of a writer Damien Chazelle is. His directing of this movie is redolent of how I perceive most David Fincher films (sadly, no climactic scene revolves around the contents of a box. Brad Pitt done maximized that storytelling plot- point for all of time.). It's very hard not to appreciate this film's directing, acting, or cinematography, but even if they're aspects you were underwhelmed by, it's a definite film worth an honest viewing."
" Best motivating movie
",2017-08-23 00:00:00,10,"Never give up, watch this movie, and when you fall, just remember this movie and you will give up even if you are dying. I watched this movie it was like 10 minutes, a great drama. I had fall in my exams and I was thinking to surrender everything went bad, but when I watch this movie my heart started to pulsate again. And now that is the time of exams I am thinking to pass at least 5 or 6 or more. Now I am asking my self how is possible that I did not watch or hear before for this movie. How did I watch some great movie and not this. I think that everyone whom their life is going down not should but must watch this movie."
" Great Movie and Great Music
",2017-08-19 00:00:00,10,"Overall, this is a great movie with a mix of a ton of feelings and a love story all rolled into one. If you're looking for a pick-me-up or to a good story and great experience, the fast-paced nature of the film, and the added romantic aspects, this movie was truly a great one. this is undoubtedly the movie for you."
" Greatness. Is it worth it?
",2017-08-12 00:00:00,8,"Damien Chazelle gives an astonishing portrayal of ambition and the quest for greatness. Andrew (Miles Teller) is a freshman with a dream to become one of the greatest drummers in history. He dreams to become a legend that lasts forever. Terrence Fletcher (J. K. Simmons), a music instructor in one of the most prestigious music academies, sees potential in Andrew and decides to mentor him. Fletcher, however, has a ruthless philosophy on teaching and goes to great, arguably inhumane, lengths to realizing his students' potentials. In fact, one of his students ends up suiciding possibly because of the methods and pressure Fletcher places on his students. He always has students on edge, even when Andrew is core drummer, he gets him a phoney second drummer to keep Andrew on edge. Fletcher believes that you must be pushed beyond your limits, far beyond them until you are either discouraged, or achieve greatness. Andrew expresses his obsession with greatness and success very clearly at a family dinner when he starts talking about Charlie Parker and how nothing but legacy and greatness matters. When he decides to take Nicole (Melissa Benoist) out on a date, he enters a relationship that later puts him in a dilemma. Eventually, Andrew feels that this relationship will threaten his path for greatness, he feels (as he explained to Nicole) that Nicole will drag him down, that every minute spent with her is a minute taken from his practice, and so he will inevitably hate her. Andrew goes on to practice till his hands bleed, survives a bloody car crash, gets kicked out of the band, gets humiliated in front of an audience that could make or break his career, to finally delivering one of the greatest, most electrifying performances anyone has seen. I believe that when analyzing a movie, it is irrelevant whether or not it was ""right"" that he left Nicole, I think that the fact that as a viewer you could tell that Andrew was going to leave her or that you were convinced of his actions as a character shows very good screenplay. The question is not whether Fletcher's methods or Andrew's actions are right, but whether greatness is worth its cost."
" Good movie, but not realistic
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,10,"Real music schools (studied music and jazz myself for years with national top teachers) don't have teachers like this, atmosphere like this kills creativity. Real atmosphere is much more positive and based on encouraging, not threatening. Yes it's extremely competitive business where everyone works incredibly hard, but still it mainly happens in good spirit, since you won't get into bands if people hate you. Nothing new or groundbreaking is born in the atmosphere of fear, just mechanic repetition of old. But it doesn't matter for the story, great acting,interesting plot twists, great... pretty much everything. Great movie."
" Brilliant..!
",2017-08-03 00:00:00,8,"what I saw? I saw a single interpretation , a single actor playing the movie.. j. k. Simmons ... Just brilliant.. nothing more to say... 8 stars because it was just about him, everything .. Him.. the young guy, Miles Teller.. was good, a 19y.o. boy that wanted to be The best, but a super talented maestro could and could not agree and let him live the dream."
" A Magnifying Glass on one extreme aspect of dedication
",2017-08-02 00:00:00,8,"Dedication is just one part of being a musician, or being anything for that matter. This movie zooms in and exaggerates just that one aspect. It fools you into feeling like you are in a version of reality because it is so intense -- but it's like having blinders on. There's more to being a musician obviously.The bad reviews seem to be from people who expected reality, or who believed the intent was to depict reality and the writers didn't know the difference. It's Hollywood, not a documentary. Something tells me the writers knew exactly what they were doing. It's very well done. Expect an intense ride, not an all-encompassing view on life."
" Amazingly intense and powerful film
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,9,"This is an extraordinarily intense film. Although it is about jazz, it has as much tension as the original version of Halloween. The compelling confrontation between teacher and student provides enough drama on its own; add to this a brilliant musical performance - especially the climactic drum solo - and you have a masterpiece. The acting of J.K. Simmons was mesmerizing; Andrew Newman was excellent and so was Melissa Benoist, of whom we saw far too little. I would recommend this film to anyone (unless you have a heart condition), and for jazz-lovers, it's a must-see."
" Miles Teller was incredible
",2017-07-21 00:00:00,10,"Miles Teller is an extremely underrated actor. He perfectly depicts the stress and commitment of his character without becoming over dramatic and fake. The desperation that his character felt in the want to succeed was so easily illustrated to the viewer, which only made me want him to succeed even more and reach his goal."
" A Spellbinding Film.
",2017-07-21 00:00:00,10,"I had no expectations when I rented this film. We rented the DVD and watched it on a small, 18 inch screen; but I had no idea it would be the most captivating movie experience I would have in years. The movie has been analyzed, deconstructed, theorized, among other things.. so there is not much else I can add other than it being a movie that rarely resonates to a level like when I first saw it. To me, it's a perfect film and a movie that I recommend to everybody."
" Disturbingly Great
",2017-07-20 00:00:00,10,"This is my First ever review so Please understand I am a newbie. I felt I had to review this movie because I feel it is one of the greatest stories that most of us will never see in real life. J.K Simmons does a fabulous job at being the antagonist, You want to hate him but you cant because you know what he is trying to do! Part is played to perfection.!Miles Teller does a great job playing the Determined Student that believes in himself Knows what he wants and goes through hell to achieve his dream! The story is moving, it touches so many feelings when you watch it. The sweat the blood the Tears all seam totally realistic.Movies Like this have to make you wonder how great some people could be if they are pushed beyond all reasonable expectations instead of getting a trophy for just showing up!"
" This is what it takes if you have rules for yourself
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,9,"I rather like this movie. It is the one that made me go on IMDb to get rid of my high reviews for movies that were really only a small cut above the norm for their genre. This is as pure as it gets for its genre, and still leaves tons of room for arguing about in a dessert shop after the movie. I know what side of the argument I would be on. I really don't even care that some people are self-involved for a while. It would be pretty boring to realize everything all at once anyway."
" A Masterpiece
",2017-07-16 00:00:00,10,"Quite simply, a superbly minimalist film. I could repeat the points raised in all of the glowing reviews, but to spare the monotony, I'll just say that the film makes brilliant use of a combination of great music, accomplished performances, a simple story and is sensationally inspiring. I can't recommend this film enough."
" Terrible film with unlikable characters
",2017-07-13 00:00:00,1,"One of the worst movies we've ever seen. Any great story needs to have characters that you actually care about and that you can relate to. But this story has nothing but a**holes as characters. Apparently, we're supposed to be rooting for the kid who wants to be a drummer, but he treats EVERYONE like crap -- he treats his family like crap, he treats his girlfriend like crap, he treats fellow students like crap. He isn't nice to anybody the entire film. We also have no idea WHY he wants to be a drummer so badly -- we know literally NOTHING about him the entire film. Similarly, the teacher is portrayed as the worst human being on planet earth, so we obviously don't care about him either. Therefore, we're left with a movie about 2 a**holes competing to be the biggest a**hole. It's really surprising that such an unlikable and terrible film got such rave reviews, but that just shows you that Americans can no longer distinguish good films from bad films anymore."
" Best drummer movie you will ever see
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,9,"In an attempt to become the next greatest musician, Andrew(Miles Teller) enlists at Shafer Conservatory, a New York music school, where he is brought into a local band where he meets Terrence Fletcher(JK Simmon), a music teacher renowned for his peculiar methods, who pushes him to the edge of his ability, mentality and sanity.A really spectacular film. One of the greatest musician stories around, portrayed beautifully by such talented acting from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. Left me wanting more, and definitely had some twists and turns that I didn't expect, which was really nice. I cannot find a major flaw with this movie. Granted, there isn't really such thing as a flawless movie but I cannot find a major flaw that takes you out of the viewing experience. The music is excellent. I mean the acting is spectacular. Perfectly written, spectacularly directed and honestly one of the best dramas made in the past decade."
" Great performance and great storytelling
",2017-07-06 00:00:00,10,I don't think this review is new for somebody. This movie is impressive. Very well constructed. Beautiful performed. The cinematography is gorgeous. Damien is doing a great job. He could win the Academy Award for best director for Whiplash but I think it was to early so they gave it to him for La La Land. The script of Whiplash is perfect. The editing pace played a very important role in how the entire story was managed. J.K Simmons is stelar. Great job.
" ""Black Swan"" on Steroids
",2017-06-30 00:00:00,8,"I kept putting off watching ""Whiplash"" as part of my effort to watch all of IMDb's top 250 despite its current placement at an impressive 45th ranking and an 8.5 rating. I must admit I did feel before watching this film that I would find it overrated (and I do hold that opinion just now but to a much smaller extent) and that the subject matter wouldn't be highly engaging. I guess I was wrong to make those assumptions in hindsight for the most part.The film is basically about a talented young drummer Andrew (played by Miles Teller) who is taken to his limits by his tormenting and brutal mentor Fletcher (played by JK Simmons). Andrew has to cope with this harassment and must weigh up his life and the difficulties of pursuing his dream and whether it is worth it or not. The whole premise of a talented individual seeking greatness or who's entire existence seems devoted to success is a well-trodden one. However, this film sees the footprints that other films have made and chooses to walk in a different direction instead of stepping in the impressions already made. Most films of the like seem to think ambition and obsession of this nature as a bad thing that corrupts the soul but in ""Whiplash"" that is clearly not the message. It shows us that the strive for greatness is always painful, arduous and poisonous and leaves us wondering if it's worth it. However, at the same time it also shows the benefits of overcoming this adversity and the sense of satisfaction and meaning it can give to you.Great art is often born out of great pain and ""Whiplash"" shows this in the bluntest fashion possible. It is terrifying but it is also incredibly inspirational.I kept drawing comparisons to ""Black Swan"" when watching this film and, although I feel that ""Black Swan"" is still a good film, I feel that ""Whiplash"" achieves a deeper, broader and greater meaning than this albeit similar film. ""Black Swan"" is often melodramatic, basic in aspects of its story, its themes and its imagery and I'd say pretentious in many ways. It thinks it's smarter or deeper than it really is. ""Whiplash"" is a really grounded story, it delivers perfect tension consistently throughout the film. I thought there would be large lulls in between important scenes but it proves to be an uncomfortable (in a good way!) watch from start to finish. ""Whiplash"" explores the relationship of the mentor and the protagonist expertly and manages to expose positives and negatives in each character that gives you a rather confused and unsettled opinion on both (again in a good way!). It manages to avoid tired clichés like the ""suffocating family figure who plants their failed dreams into their children"" (""Black Swan"" etc). In ""Whiplash"" it seems like Andrew is seeking attention and recognition from his family who have little to do with his life as a performer which is an entirely different situation. It doesn't touch the idea that ""despite my success I don't find satisfaction"" (""Raging Bull"" etc) instead it revels in the moments were Andrew is able to achieve a victory which inches him closer to his goal. A major commendation has to go to the direction which is able to capture the frantic scenes unfold deftly. It is incredibly difficult to capture such frantic movements on that drum set in a way that is digestible and enthralling to the audience. Tension is hard to capture and Chazelle manages to relish bottling it up. The music is great of course as you'd expect. Where I will criticise, this film is to justify my view that it is overrated in its high ranking on the top 250. The lead performance by Miles Teller is good, very good, but it's not an exceptional performance that's incredibly memorable. It's what I'd call a generically good performance (which is not a bad thing) but just that he doesn't stand out against the leads of the films around ""Whiplash"". You'd think of Marty McFly or Maximus Decimus Meridius before Andrew I'm sure. I actually found Natalie Portman's Oscar winning role in ""Black Swan"" to be superior if I am being honest (which may be surprising to the reader of this review). JK Simmons is the star of the film in my eyes and is indeed a very memorable and nuanced performance. I am not surprised in the slightest to learn of his Oscar win that year. However, this is a typical Simmons role that is playing to his strengths and isn't what I'd call transformative although this is by far his best (and one of the best) portrayals of this ""type"" of character which is certainly due to the great script. Quite simply I will say this is a great film in every aspect. People might say that my criticism in my previous paragraph is unfair and perhaps that is true. You could describe this film as a band itself- you could have one very talented musician/actor who steals the show but if all the others in the band/production don't play their part then it's worth nought. Whilst no individual aspect of this film is truly exceptional the way that everything comes together to make a great film is perhaps the best compliment anyone can really give a film truth be told. This is a really short, exciting and easy film to watch and will excite film buffs and general audiences easily."
" Excellent
",2017-06-26 00:00:00,9,"The demand for musical (jazz) excellence is melted with the extreme relationship between the student and the teacher. In this movie we are confronted with a situation between the will of the student to become an all time GREAT musician, ready to do everything for it, and the teacher who wants to discover the new Charlie Parker.The great part about this movie is the psychological relationship between the student and the teacher, extreme and violent. It appears that the teacher seems sick-minded about his class, threatening the students not to bring his reputation down. You sometimes wonder how a student can accept this but it also seems like all the students admire him and especially Andrew (the student), and his ambition to be the very best makes him forget all the things Terrence Fletcher (the teacher) is inflicting on him.The performances of the 2 lead actors J.K Simmons and Miles Teller are really special, a great psychological battle between theses two. We can really feel the tension and the ambition of each character in this movie. And, the realization allows us to see all the pain Andrew goes through.In a more general way this movie puts in perspective the extreme demands and standards of the highest music schools and all the psychological pressure that theses youngsters have to deal with. Is it normal to allow this or does the path the greatness require this?"
" Very good
",2017-06-26 00:00:00,8,"Whiplash is the story of a young, talented drummer, Andrew, who enters a famous conservatory with a very demanding teacher. During the whole movie, we follow Andrew in his everyday life, where he has to train harder and harder to hope to be part of a concert ensemble. But his teacher is really obsessed by his idea to find the new Charlie Parker in one of his students, and is really tough with them.It's really interesting to follow the evolution of Andrew during the movie, and how the relationship with his teacher affects him. The teacher being violent, closed-minded and nervous changes Andrew's way of seeing his future. He sometimes feels that he can become one of the best drummers in the world, and sometimes that he is not good enough to be part of his teacher's band. This love-hate relationship is put forward by the fact that Andrew has a deep fascination for Terence, his teacher. He always wants to do his best but cannot always meet his teacher's requirements. The whole movie is just a portrait of how music at a high level can be difficult, and how students have to work to fulfill their dreams of becoming a great musician."
" Surprisingly good
",2017-06-26 00:00:00,10,"I wasn't interested in watching this film at all when it went into the cinema, as it wasn't my sort of film. However, when It came on television, I thought it would be good as a 'background' film. I spent the next 1h 47m watching this film, not as a background movie, but it had my full interest."
" Rocky for the 21st Century
",2017-06-19 00:00:00,1,"This can only be understood in the light of Rocky winning best picture at the 1976 Academy Awards.This is your standard inspirational movie. You can almost time to the minute that the 'girlfriend' appears.It's a movie aimed at people who are inspired by motivational speeches, where every aspect of the speech is predictable. But many people like predictability, that's the attraction. This movie is the predictable inspirational movie with a few alterations. The teacher is the enemy and there's some shades of grey sadism. And it's about jazz, not boxing.In many ways it could be a parable of our times. Gone is the brawler from the working class, instead we have a middle-class white person wanting to play jazz - a nearly dead art form, kept alive by music schools for middle-class white people. The middle-class white person is now achieving heroism. Overcoming your background is now an existential experience, not a reality.In terms of jazz, it's a million miles away from the black people who dominated this art form: Billie and Ella, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Mingus and Monk. It's closer to modern classical music: gone are the days of Rossini and Puccini writing brilliant music to earn a living, instead we have piano competitions. Of course, if the student was black, it wouldn't have a market. Well, actually the student probably wouldn't be black to begin with.Black jazz is dead. Long live middle-class white people 'fighting' for a shot at 'perfection'. Can you imagine Thelonious Monk and Bud Powell in some kind of 'duel' to see who could out-do each other on a piano? This is the 45th best film of all time, according to voters. What times we live in. This film makes Eddie Murphy in Beverley Hills Cop look like hard realism based on a Pulitzer Prize winning piece of journalism"
" i have seen it 13 times
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,9,"I ask you to forgive me if i have taken so long to write a review of Whiplash, but even today i am not sure i can. I do not know how to capture the emotions that build in me when i watch this film. I will do it the other way around.I really do not care for the segments of Andrew(Miles Teller)'s personal life. Yes, they do add a bit of character development, but outside the story. The real development is his development as a drummer. And how Fletcher(Simmons) affects it.I confess that i am a music professional. I went to music school and while the teachers are not like Fletcher, the exaggeration of his character in Whiplash is an expression of the drive that successful musicians truly have.We have all had bleeding fingers, passed out from practicing too much, and putting music above everything else. All these things are true, and i accept that Whiplash exaggerates it to make you SEE what musicians FEEL.Now, on to the production. The photography is superb. I love every camera angle, ever light shot. The direction and dialogue are flawless. Teller has his limits as an actor, but he fits perfectly in this role, and Simmons was born to play the part of Fletcher. I have watched this film 13 times. I decided to give away the DVD because i would have probably watched it many more times again. If you are a musician, you are not complete unless you watch Whiplash.And for the others .. well, Whiplash is a weird film. It might struggle to get its message across to you, or you might simply not be interested or not realize why Andrew is the real winner in the last scene, or what he has accomplished. It breaks my heart, but rules are rules.As this film is aimed at a limited audience, it can only score:9/10 - a monumental masterpiece for anyone involved in music."
" Breath-taking! The impossible is right over there!
",2017-06-10 00:00:00,9,"Wow, I could say many things about this movie, but I'll try to be simple. It is just and only one of the most inspiring films that I've ever seen! The performances are simply amazing, the plot could be better, but even though it deserves to be known as pure art, due to the passion that Miles Teller transmit. The lesson I got from this is to never give up, to focus and to truly believe in our quality. Concluding, for me it's a modern masterpiece of filmmaking! Extremely recommended!"
" A Monster of a Movie
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,9,"A film as intense as The Deer Hunter (1978) and as dialogue-less as 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Whiplash weaves a depraved tale using sounds just as much as words. The film climaxes with a moral question of monstrosity versus purpose built up with a paralleling story of a dueling student and teacher. While one transforms from golden god to relatable monster, the other morphs from innocence to sin. The ultimate scene depicts their relationship perfectly while leaving room for interpretation in what can only be called a moral mystery. The drums act as a metaphor for a normal humans ambitions and beatings of himself, while there remains an underlying sexual connotation to the film: sadism and masochism, is there a limit? And the same question can be applied to any theme, scene, line, or note in the entire film. Is there a limit? J.K. Simmons is a master in turning the iconic Fletcher from monster to human and back again. From the very moment, Fletcher walks in the door, Simmons exudes an aura of intimidating prowess, yet the viewer also picks up on a hidden humor, sadness, and humanity. Every award Simmons won, he deserved in what may be the most chilling performances since Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood (2007). Miles Teller takes on more: a transformation from reliability to deprivation. Does he succeed? That answer lies with Andrew. Teller fully embodied the performance into the role of Andrew. Damien Chazelle orchestrates, directs, and writes. The sounds mimic the tensions, the tensions are splayed out for the viewer, and the writing is impeccable, picking up on the casualness in the father-son relationship (in the theater) and the intensity of the training. This cinematic genius combines music and visual to perfection as two sides of the same coin. This cinematic genius leaves the viewer so emotionally, mentally, and physically drained, he remains seated for the entirety of the credits realizing the enormity of what he saw, while picking apart the closing music for last glimpses of meaning. This cinematic genius was unfortunately cheesy. A clichéd story of a rising star. Can Andrew really be the best after one year? Maybe the movie is imbued with so much meaning, it forgot its believability at the front door, along with its measuring gauges so the viewer could know what was going on? Is Andrew playing well or not? We don't know until someone tells us. How many times do we think he's playing well until we're shot down along with Andrew? Simmons is our masterful visual cue subtly indicating when Andrew is a star or not. The movie goes south when Simmons is out. The film is genius with Simmons on screen."
" Moving, captivating film
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,7,"This movie was far better than I expected it to be. After being told to watch by a few people , this isn't normally my type of film, I thought no harm in giving it a go. Id say to defiantly watch Whiplash, its such a moving heartfelt film, which captivates it watches. I'm not one for jazz music but put this aside and you don't necessarily notice.The acting was superb from both lead actors and they made it feel like the were generally invested in the characters they were playing.I would recommend watching this film to anyone, even for the experience."
" The worst goddamn movie, infuriatingly bad
",2017-05-31 00:00:00,1,"I knew that Damien Chazelle was overrated after witnessing the immense hype over La La Land. It was good but not 8.3 good. This movie certainly is not 8.5 good. It's utterly disgusting to me that this movie received such high praise. I can see what it aimed to do but it failed so miserably in my eyes.I can't fault the cinematography. The performances, I admit were also spot on, both Teller and Simmons are clearly good actors (even though I've never seen Simmons play anything but a barking dog).The entire movie I was waiting for a moment where the tyrant would crack or be punished or change, but it never came and by the end, I hoped to see him get hit by a truck too. When that lawyer showed up I thought 'finally! That kid's gonna stop that bastard from abusing him or anyone else' but he was like 'whatever, do what ya want'. Queue truck number two.I don't understand how a movie that condones and encourages the absolute disregard for human rights can be rated so highly; I don't understand how the misogyny and homophobia are brushed over. Someone killed themselves because of that jerk and he still doesn't regret any of his actions.Chazelle is obsessed with ambition (and with jazz) and he prioritizes it over humanity and love which I can't stand. He makes his characters self-centered and selfish in the name of ambition and art. He sure has a way of making me not care for the protagonists. I mean, what does it matter if you are a household name and made really great music -or any other type of art- if you were a bad person? What the hell is the meaning of a nice-sounding jazz song if there is no beautiful feeling behind it? This movie's ultimate message is that to be an artist you must abandon your humanity and loved ones and that is something I cannot accept.This movie has given me a headache and it's not just because of the loud drums."
" Whiplash will **** you like a pig!
",2017-05-31 00:00:00,10,"'WHIPLASH' was directed by Damian Chazelle and stars Miles Teller and Jk Simmons. ​In an attempt to become the next greatest musician, Andrew(Miles Teller) enlists at Shafer Conservatory, a New York music school, where he is brought into a local band where he meets Terrence Fletcher(JK Simmon), a music teacher renowned for his peculiar methods, who pushes him to the edge of his ability, mentality and sanity.Oh my god this movie is amazing. It's not a simple story of about drumming and some bloke with a pig fetish. It's a deep, heartfelt story about obsession and commitment, and what that can do to a man. Miles Teller delivers a career defining performances as Andrew but is greatly overshadowed by JK Simmons. Simmons take this movie from good to great and elevates it to amazing. Considering this is Chazelle's debut feature; it's a god damn amazing first attempt. If you've not seen this literal masterpiece; please, do yourself a favour and see it.This story is not just a simple story about music. I hate it when people say that. This is a dark story about how obsession can drastically affect your life. Chazelle has masterfully wrote this harrowing tale and if is his opener; I cannot wait to see his final piece. Combine Chazelle's awesome plot and screenplay with a fantastic climax and a brave, bold ending, and you have a freaking awesome drama that I see debuting a very promising career.To say that Captain Pig Fetish was anything less than awesome, spectacular and amazing in this movie would be an insult to his wonderful performance. He made this movie his personal pig and took it to town. Without him, I dare say this movie wouldn't be as good as it is and he definitely elevates this movie above everything else. Accompanying Simmons is the amazing Miles Teller, who plays his role of Andrew expertly and is the perfect protagonist for this movie. His more barren, emotionless nature really fits in with the themes of this movie and helps sell them to a tee. The 'chemistry' between Simmons and Teller is one of the best things in history. I adore them in this movie.This movie is also technically flawless. The cinematography is awesome throughout, especially the climax where the camera moves in line with the music. I think it's an excellent looking movie and definitely proves that Damian Chazelle has promise. Another note is how dark and bleak the colour pallet is for the costumes and sets. This might seem like a bad thing but I personally think it works perfectly in line with the themes in the movie.I cannot find a major flaw with this movie. Granted, there isn't really such thing as a flawless movie but I cannot find a major flaw that takes you out of the viewing experience. The music is excellent. I mean the acting is spectacular. Perfectly written, spectacularly directed and honestly one of the best dramas made in the past decade. Please watch this movie if you haven't, it's an amazing movie and you will definitely not be disappointed. I'd rate it a 10/10 purely for the pig line alone."
" Great but i have tiny nitpicks
",2017-05-27 00:00:00,9,"Whiplash is about a young man who wants to be a drummer but when he gets moved to a higher class the teacher is a bully who will do anything to his students to get a good show. The teacher is played by J.K Simons who is absolutely incredible. His performance is intense and will have you fearing for the students but at times he can also be so cruel that its funny. That might sound like a bad thing but it definitely isn't. the music is also really good and you got see the young man, played by Miles Teller, get better at drumming as the film went along. Miles Teller also gave a very great performance, most of the time he was on screen I forgot he was acting he was so realistic. There were lots of shots of him drumming were it focused on his face and you could see how much he wanted to be the best drummer ever no matter what. Although Miles Teller gave a very great performance after the film had ended i didn't really feel i knew a lot about who his character except that he wanted to be a drummer, that may have been intentional to try and show that he didn't want anything but to be a drummer but I felt that his character wasn't all that fleshed out. Also there was a love interest in the beginning of the film who was really good but she was only in about two scenes and i wanted to see more of her. Also (and this is a really small nitpick) there's a dinner scene in the film that was probably my favorite scene in the film but it was way to short and I wanted it to be longer.I recommend this film cause it has amazing performances and is also incredibly well directed and well shot."
" The movie is good. This review, however, is actually a segment of a larger article that is not primarily focused on the film. Read it at your own leisure.
",2017-05-23 00:00:00,10,"This erosion of innocent ideas, like The American Dream, is becoming more and more prominent, especially amongst young people. The success of Damien Chazelle's, Whiplash, is a testament to this. Miles Teller stars as Andrew Neiman, an obsessive drummer who is hell- bent on becoming a great musician. J.K. Simmons stars as Terence Fletcher, the muscled up old teacher who incessantly yells at Andrew and perpetuates his inferiority complex. A large number of High School and University students found this movie to be scarily relatable. Whether it was the memory of an intimating teacher/mentor, or the shared belief that socializing, relationships and 'fun', will impede on one's ability to achieve some kind of success – audiences clearly empathize with this film, and that may not be a good thing.(Spoiler Alert) In the final scene of Whiplash, Andrew and Terence have seemingly buried the hatchet on their old and troubled student/teacher relationship. Andrew agrees to perform at a Jazz concert, under Terence's conducting. When the concert commences, however, the first song that is cued to be played is unknown to Andrew. He realizes that Terence has sabotaged him, and he ultimately leaves the stage. After embracing with his father, who walks over to console him, Andrew returns to the stage. To Terence's bewilderment, Andrew begins playing the drums solo. The scene runs for a while, and as time moves on, Andrew's solo becomes more impressive. Terence eventually accepts Andrew's rebellious action and begins conducting him. In the final seconds of Andrew's solo, Terence looks at him. Although the frame cuts off just below Terence's nose, the film's prior exposition suggests that he either smiled at Andrew, or said, 'good job'. Terence then cues the rest of the band, and the film closes on a loud jazz cadence – cue: credits.This final scene has been a hot-topic of debate in the YouTube and Twitter-sphere. The debate rests on whether or not Whiplash had a 'happily ever after' ending or not. Should the audience be happy that Andrew made his mentor proud, and that he became a great musician? Or should the audience feel melancholic because of what Andrew sacrificed to reach his level of excellence? Has Andrew's story given the American Dream hope? Or has he demonstrated that it will doom you to live a life without happiness?Film critics almost unanimously agree that it was a bitter-sweet ending; Andrew became great, but at the cost of his youth, and possibly his moral compass. Amongst the University student demographic (my demographic), however, there seems to be a disproportionate number of people who interpreted the ending more so as a triumph of ambition and perseverance. For a story about a young man who pushes himself to the brink of implosion, this kind of interpretation should leave older generations wondering what kind of principles of ethics and work life balance their younger counter-parts are embracing.Do not get me confused, I think Whiplash is brilliant – too brilliant. If I am criticizing the film, then that is my criticism. I loved Whiplash. Many other young people loved Whiplash too, but I am beginning to feel that this may be indicative of a warped understanding of success.Films can be much more than weekend entertainment; they are a helpful way to gauge the psyche of a particular target audience. It is a shame that there have not been many social science studies that have attributed film preferences to specific human characteristics; it would be a very helpful variable. For example, if American Psycho has a large cult following, and millions of people still watch and love the film, would it not be fair to say that there are characteristics that the murderous protagonist, Patrick Bateman, has that most viewers within this demographic empathize with? I am not suggesting that these people are all secretly serial killers – however hyperbolic the connection, there must be something about a character or concept that people empathize with that makes the film so enjoyable for them. Similarly, Whiplash's Andrew Neiman must clearly have some element to his character's psyche that most viewers identify with."
" A modern masterpiece and an inspiring tale.
",2017-05-23 00:00:00,10,"Each decade or so, at least one film comes that blows and captures the audiences' mind and heart. Whiplash is one of those movies, and for very good and understandable reason. Whiplash is the first ever feature film directed by Damien Chazelle and features a strong cast, having JK Simmons and Miles Teller in the lead performance. The story follows an ambitious drummer who wants to achieve greatness. He is tutored by a psychotic mentor who uses any means necessary to bring the student's potential. So the story doesn't sound that complex or new, why does the film gets this huge amount of praise and love? Well, for a lot of reasons. First, this film is beautifully crafted. From the graceful usage of camera, lighting to the phenomenal cinematography, this film truly handles the art of craft in a way that benefits the experience of the film. You get immersed in the story and the conflict the characters face. The focused shots give a great detail of the picture. The lighting of the film gives an intense feel, with its shadowy, orange and green colors. It just amplifies the experience. One of the other stronger points in the film is definitely the performances by Miles Teller and JK Simmons. Miles Teller gives a strong, passionate performance which fits his ambitious character. He is very relatable and you want to follow his dream till the very end. JK Simmons gives the best performance in the movie, with an eerie psychotic and intimidating performance, his character is one of the scariest mentors to ever come across the big screen. Surprisingly though, the character is not just some violent mentor. There is an incredible amount of depth that this character has. And even his violent nature plays an integral part to develop Miles' character. The third act of the movie is possibly one of the greatest third acts in film history. This is the climax of the film that has been built up since the beginning, and it exceeds expectations with its subtle character development, phenomenal performances and fantastic film making. The film proves that one element of film making is not enough to inspire. All other elements matter, and the director shows this with his directing. His full control gives a near perfect film, with very few minor flaws. Whiplash is not just a great film, its an outstanding masterpiece and one of the best modern movies that will possibly be seen as a classic in the future. Highly recommend it."
" A Rip Off of Full Metal Jacket and Black Swan
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,1,"Cinematography looks like urine stain. Lots of shaky hand-held camera work, lazy. The acting is atrocious. Miles Teller sucks like always. JK Simmons plays a cartoon character. The dialogue sounds like it was written by a pretentious Harvard student. This film is a rip off of Full Metal Jacket. They have the drill instructor that is loud and over the top, except the dialogue is trash. The music is boy band crap, not real Jazz. The film rips off Black Swan's plot. The drive of ambition and obsession of art forcing the individual to sacrifice everything and embrace his artistic values to the next level. Oh yeah, there was a movie called Black Swan. Nice try Chazelle, but you've been caught 2/2 ripping off other people's work. I hope Chazelle gets sued. He is no artist, he is a copycat like Tarantino.0/10."
" I wasn't expecting that!
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,8,"Despite the many glowing reviews on IMDb and elsewhere, I honestly wasn't expecting much from this film. I thought it would be similar to 'School of Rock', not only in terms of plot but also quality. Instead, 'Whiplash' offers something totally different to the music genre. It plays out more like a thriller - a brutal, tense and compelling thriller.This film scores top marks in all areas. The acting is first class and the script is sharp and intelligent, with a story that has you hooked from the very first scene. That said, it does push its luck in parts. Some scenes are far-fetched, such as when Andrew almost gets killed in a car crash before calmly jogging to his concert, soaked in blood. There's dedication, and then there's stupidity.Overall though, there is no doubt that this is one of 2014's best films, and perhaps the best music film I have ever seen. For sheer entertainment value, I would highly recommend 'Whiplash'."
" Outstanding performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons, powerful direction and a tale of inspiration from the world of obsession
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,10,"A new work of a young director, Damien Chazelle's Whiplash is a total blast of sweat from start to finish. It gives you a false sense of security as the film begins with a young finely talented student Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller) plays the drums as he dreams to be the finest drum artist appreciated by others, of his new generations. Then, he comes across with a rather different type of a music instructor who will cause anything to realize a student's potential of music. As these two characters conflict on each other, most of the film progresses these events with very intense sequences that made my hands dripping with sweat.Whiplash can be diverse into a category of a dramatic film relating to the main topic of jazz music and a thriller film that never lets the audience take a deep breath of comfort throughout. The film illustrates perfectly of what every student might have feared the worst teacher who considers as enemies towards his/her's student, who will do literally commit anything to find his or her's potential. An instructor, Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simons) is the exact type of professor that always challenges the student to a hole of death which they can never climb to breathe fresh air. While, the instructor being very relentless and brutally eager, he has a side of appreciation as he peels off layers of the student's potential. J.K. Simons portrayal and performance of this fearful relentless instructor is one to appreciate and gives a courageous and terrifying performance in which we as an audience, starts to be violated like as Andrew Neyman. In the other hand, a hard working inspiring student acted by Miles Teller, who has a true dream by heart is the one who meets Terence Fletcher as an instructor, and gets horribly treated, called with varieties of swearwords and psychologically tormented, is so heartbreaking and unbelievably touched. He gives a woody and thoughtful performance as he the protagonist gets forced to fall down to a hell and rise up facing a somewhat battle against Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simons). It is so riveting of a process of how these personally opposite people clash with each other.This film is intense, inspiring and hand gripping from start to finish making it a brilliant praiseworthy filmmaker Damien Chazelle, one to look forward to and be inspired. Also, a riveting vehicle for stars J.K. Simons and Miles Teller, ones worth-ed to be complemented. This film has no sharp or outstanding flaws, making this one of the finest pieces of work of that time of period. This is definitely one of the best films of 2014. I knew nothing but a confessed drum artist, but glad that this film exists to illustrate these stories in an unconventional method."
" super!
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,10,"I watched this film one year ago. And the effect of viewing has surpassed all expectations! Thanks to this film, I began to take a different attitude to my hobby. I put some goals in front of me.This film makes you think about priorities.What is more important? Everyone decides for himself, of course. But why you spend more time on the Internet if you can achieve success and fulfill your dream, for example? Actors in this film, in my opinion, are chosen perfectly.The main character of this film acts unpredictably. This makes the film much more interesting. I advise you to watch this movie!"
" A ""Music Movie"" that manages to get everything about music completely wrong.
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,1,"As a professional musician of 20 years, I would like to say a little something about this movie and it's odd ""message"". (or lack thereof...)Becoming a great musician takes years and years of hard work and a lot of sacrifice. However, the real process, in real life, looks NOTHING like this movie. The idea that a mentally unstable, psychotically aggressive and (perhaps worst of all) completely INCONSISTENT teacher/mentor like the Fletcher character would be of any actual use to an aspiring musician is pure garbage. It might make for great ""drama"", but it does not reflect how things work in the real world at all. What saddens me is the thought that young aspiring musicians might watch this drivel and think it's an accurate portrayal of what it is to be a ""great"" musician and what you have to do to achieve that greatness. Or even worse, that some aspiring teacher might watch this and be ""inspired"" to follow Fletcher's method of ""teaching by terror"" because of the results it achieves in the movie. In reality ""Fletcher's method"" is flawed. It will not create ""a new Charlie Parker"". It will, in fact, not create any new ""great jazz artists"" at all. With a little luck, it might produce a few semi-useful second row puppets, but that's about it. (And even those guys would likely never get hired, since the asshole mentality that has been drilled into them would make them completely impossible to work with...)"
" ""Whiplash"" stakes claim as indie frontrunner
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,10,"Independent films have grown increasingly popular as of late. 2014 was filled with these types of movies that seemingly came out of nowhere, and ""Whiplash"" was one of the frontrunners.Miles Teller plays Andrew Neiman, an aspiring jazz drummer attending Shaffer Conservatory in New York City. Terence Fletcher, played by J.K. Simmons, is a well-respected instructor at the university who takes notice of Neiman and recruits him for his studio band. Neiman's excitement to join the band is short-lived, however, as Fletcher's brutal methods of teaching prove immensely taxing, physically and emotionally. Throughout the film, it is difficult to tell if Fletcher is a protagonist or antagonist. Do his methods truly better his students or is he just trying to find his own Buddy Rich? Where does an instructor draw the line? Is being one of the greats worth losing one's humanity? Neiman desires to be great, and this is shown in his decision-making throughout the film. His passion allows him to endure Fletcher's physical and emotional abuse, and the battle of wits that ensues between the two actors is where the movie shines. Damien Chazelle's writing and direction fuels the intensity of the performances. Chazelle himself struggled to make it as a jazz drummer in high school, and he even had an intense music instructor who inspired the character of Terence Fletcher. His musical experience is evident in the script, and the quality of the jazz music is no doubt a testament to Chazelle's guiding hand in the production.The music itself is captivating, and Fletcher's ferocious conducting is not only the product of good acting. Simmons graduated with a music degree from the University of Montana, where he minored in composition and conducting.Teller also possessed some experience in rock drumming tracing back to his teen years. Rock drumming and jazz drumming are two different monsters, however, and for two months Teller trained three to four hours each day under professional drummer Nate Lang in preparation for his role. Because of his hard work, Teller was able to actually play, in portions, the difficult pieces Neiman performs in the film. However, the fluidity and intensity of Neiman's drumming is more of a testament to Tom Cross' editing.The last 30 minutes of this film will have viewers' eyes locked onto the drama; it is one of the most emotionally gripping finales I have ever seen. ""Whiplash"" is an impressive feat by 30-year-old Damien Chazelle, winning three Oscars including the well-deserved Best Supporting Actor recognition awarded to J.K. Simmons. It is a fast-paced, full-throttled drama that will have viewers on the edge of their seat until the last drum stroke."
" amazing music movie
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,10,"""Whiplash"" was my best movie I had ever seen. I'm so regretful that I didn't watch this movie in theater. I should watch this with big screen and high quality audio. Although I watched the movie by computer, it still be impressive. I hope that many people see ""Whiplash"" and I have some reasons why I recommend this movie.First, the main character Andrew's psychology was described very delicately. In the story, Andrew became a member of the best jazz band in his school. He met the composer of the band, Professor Fletcher. He was very aggressive person. He scolded Andrew in spite of little mistake - Not my fxxking tempo! - beat him, and shamed Andrew's parents. He also drove one student away because he couldn't answer when Fletcher asked him if student made mistake even he was right.Like these, Professor Fletcher is a very awful character. Some would be shocked when they see Fletcher get angry. But fortunately, there is no person like him and should not be existed as professor. Then I found Fletcher was just one major setting to show Andrew's emotions more dramatically. It scolds Andrew to practice more and concentrate only in music. Despite Fletcher's lines and extra expressions, I could feel Andrew's delicate change of his psychology. When I get this conclusion - that Fletcher is Andrew's own character which reflects his emotions such like envy, worry, conscious - I was shocked again about director's producing.Second, if you love jazz music, you will gonna love this movie, too. My ears were so happy during every moments in this movie because of awesome musics. I even downloaded some files!When the movie ends, credit goes on, you will get into a lot of thoughts like I did. The last ten minutes was the best scene I had ever seen. I thought a lot about gifted person, musicians, their passion and bloody efforts to make themselves more better. ""Whiplash"" left me a lot of aftertaste. I trust that you would never regret for watching this."
" Perfect
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,10,"I have never related to a character more than I have in this film. Like the main character in the film, I too am a musician. I see the drive and passion behind the character that makes him a successful drummer. This movie tells a great story with a great cast AND inspires me to work hard and accomplish my goals. This movie was perfect."
" Ultimately unsatisfying
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,5,"Admittedly, Simmons's performance riveted me and frightened me more than once in the first half of the film  Until it didn't because it was too much one note, played too often.I thought the ending was a mistake, undercutting any kind of moral redemption the film might have won for itself, but even if I accept that it's ironic or postmodern or a valid artistic choice, good God, a 10 minute drum solo? You have to either be a drummer or high on LSD to enjoy a 10 minute drum solo. Cutting frequently during it did not make it any less painful. I'm sincerely shocked that some studio exec didn't manage to demand that it be edited down to five minutes, which might have been tolerable.Lest you think I'm an idiot who didn't get the point, rest assured I get the point. And I don't need all of my movies to have the moral coda that a 1964 episode of Lassie has. But this was just nihilistic, which I really don't need to pay to hear, and it ended with a freaking 10 minute drum solo. Gah!"
" Great performances but the same can't be said for the film
",2017-03-30 00:00:00,6,"Whiplash delivers some great and intense performances from Miles Teller and J K Simmons. They conveyed an intensity throughout this film and the audience can easily understand how much being a great musician means to the young Andrew. In the same respect the audience can appreciate how the teacher wants to uncover the next best thing and push for greatness. However the performances are the best part of the film because the film seemed slow and disjointed. It also felt incomplete in the end. We got the sense that the plot was about a relentless teacher striving to push his students to their full potential and you have a student striving to be the next big thing. However the film abruptly ends with Andrew's fate not being revealed. There was no text to reveal the outcome of the entire movie. Apparently this was a satisfactory ending. I understand others may not share my view but it is quite disappointing to see films made like this are considered art. We are starting to let go of coherent, deep and well thought of films in favor of incomplete, slow and dull films. What makes it worse is you have so called film critics in magazines who struggle to form basic sentences calling it art. In its essence Whiplash is characteristic of new art films that ask you see something that isn't there. To conjure up a feeling or a depth that simply does not exist in the film through its writing, symbolism or directing. Some of the critics for this film will go so far as to say you didn't see the point and then fail to explain it coherently themselves because the reality is you can't. Hot air only gets you high enough. Sadly these films are attracting more sheep or bees to an artificial honey. It's no surprise Moonlight won the 2017 Oscar for best picture."

" An absolute masterpiece
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,10,"There have been great directors in the past such as Stanley Kubrick, Sergio Leone, Alfred Hitchcock and many others. Often times people fondly remember these directors and their movies and wonder which of the directors working today will be considered one of the greats in the near future. In my opinion there are many great candidates such as Wes Anderson and Christopher Nolan, however there is a new kid in town. Damien Chazelle has officially put his stamp on the movie scene with his latest film 'La La Land' which has already received six Academy Awards and seven Golden Globes. I've already watched 'La La Land' in cinemas twice and can't recommend it highly enough and so I was curious what his other movie 'Whiplash' had to offer.In 'Whiplash' Chazelle tells the story of a teenage boy Andrew who's dream it is to become the world's greatest drummer. In order to achieve his dreams he enrolls at a music conservatory known for its very competitive jazz band helmed by Fletcher. Fletcher is no ordinary conductor and has a rather unorthodox style that does not always resonate with every member of the band. There's a lot more to this story than this, however part of the experience is not knowing what to expect. I'd hate to ruin this for anyone, but what I can tell you is that this is one of the most original stories I've seen in a long time. It's very well put together and unfolds masterfully with a lot of fun and unexpected twists and turns. Characters are very well defined and always seem to act according to their beliefs. Both Andrew and Fletcher are very interesting characters and their story lines interact beautifully. The dialogue itself is also very realistic and often appears as if it's been taken from everyday life. The script is also very well balanced as it's very serious at times but also funny when it needs to be.Behind the characters of Andrew and Fletcher are Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. Both characters were already interesting enough however the actors give them an incredible amount of depth. Teller really makes you feel for his character and when he is pushed to his limits you can't help but want to reach out through the screen and give him a helping hand. In any other movie Teller would easily have been the star of the film, however it's extremely hard to pick favourites with Simmons in the supporting role. His character is a very strict music conductor and Simons gives his all to portray this fact. If the actor is anything like his character than I would advise anyone to stay far away from him. However one of the best things about Simmons his act is that he always makes you feel as if there still is a human being hiding inside Fletcher. I would argue that with 'Whiplash' both actors have come very close to reaching the top of their abilities, but I would hope that the future will prove me wrong. What ties 'Whiplash' together is Damien Chazelle with a directional style that is absolutely stellar. Although the movie may be slow for some, in my opinion the pacing is very well thought out. The story progresses very steadily and there is never a moment where it feels as if nothing is happening. With the use of low level lighting Chazelle pulls you into every scenario and combined with the constant use of the drums this creates a sensation unlike any other movie. The drumming especially gets under your skin and the constant sense of tension this provides perfectly mirrors that which is present between the character. Even though the movie is not classified as such it most definitely feels like a thriller and I would personally rate it amongst movies such as 'The Shining' and 'The Silence of the Lambs' solely in terms of suspense.Damien Chazelle has literally created a masterpiece and if I would have to point out a flow I'd first have to watch it countably many times. However 'Whiplash' is so captivating that I would probably forget to look. The movie is extremely well directed with acting performances that are amongst some of the best I've ever seen. It features a unique story with an ending that's the cherry on top of the an already delicious cake. This movie is perfect in every sense of the word and gets a perfect five stars out of five."
" When ""Good Job"" fails to inspire...
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,9,"Rarely does a movie hit so close to ""home' that you don't know if your assessment is based upon the movie or your own experience. Whiplash pertains atop many facets of life; the definition of success, the outer perception of achievement, the dedication of those who follow a path out passion as well as a personal and pointed view of survival of the fittest (as determined by Herr Direktor). One could say that the simple lesson of whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger, but that would be too much of an arc. Whatever doesn't kill you can still put you through social and passion crushing hell. That's what I can relate to in our drummer and Conductor, brilliantly portrayed. having personally been embarrassed by my HS musical director in class and on stage, I can tell you that ""soul searching"" is a perfect phrase for such events, whether they are caused by you (in class) or by the conductor himself (on stage). You don't have to be a Charlie Parker, or have a teacher in search for him to end up with self doubt. Todd Rundgren wrote ""They say pain can bring out the artists best"" but why is self doubt so necessary to achieve greatness? I bet we really don't know what greatness is..."
" Whiplash
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,9,"When I sat down to watch this film, I didn't know what to expect. I am not usually a fan of films about musicians but this was a brilliant and tense masterpiece. The story is of a very ambitious boy named Andrew (played by Miles Teller) who is a music student in New York. He aspires to be noticed by a prestigious music teacher named Fletcher (played by J.K. Simmons). As his wish starts becoming a reality, he realises the brutality of this teacher who continually pushes him with questionable methods. Damien Chazelle's direction is almost of a tense boxing or war action drama in that it constantly uses the music of the drumming to build the tension whilst using violent and sharp editing whilst the jazz band play.Chazelle's screenplay is very well written. It is filled with humour, tension and heartbreak. The way in which Fletcher switches during Andrew's first lesson is expertly done. Fletcher relentlessly insults Andrew in a very shocking way which really creates a huge sense of sympathy for Andrew's character as he struggles to respond. The insulting dialogue is very similar to Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket' in that it is both humorous and disturbingly distressing.The performances in this film are remarkable. Miles Teller is a relative newcomer but takes to this character with so much depth and understanding. The drumming scenes look like incredible and torturous workouts and Teller really shows the pain and agony his character is going through to reach his dream. The chemistry between the two central characters is flawless. J.K. Simmons is perfect as the abusive music teacher. Simmons manages to combine Fletcher's distinguished persona with his terrifying unpredictability. Simmons reminds me of his character in Valve's 'Portal 2' in which he continuously spouts insults at the player in a darkly hilarious way.Overall, 'Whiplash' is a fascinating study of passion, ambition and love. The film asks questions about the morality of getting one's dreams and the acceptable methods of acquiring them. Full of amazing performances all around, and created with such intensity and spirit, my final rating for this film is 4.5 stars."
" Underrated
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,10,"I love watching movies like this! Excellent movie which I had never seen a trailer for nor heard anything about, so I went in cold and was shocked. Very well done with lots of gritty action and good technical drumming and music. Virtual newcomer Miles Teller holds his own against the magnificent performance J.K. Simmons. You come through most of this movie cheering for the hero and loathing the anti-hero, but then develop compassion and even understanding."

",2017-03-04 00:00:00,7,"I am a musician too but -you know- in a kinda pop-rock band and I actually felt so empty and pointless about the music I make. That film gave me the INSPIRATION and the feel of strength. Made me to look from a different perspective -what a cliché but that is true! THANKS for that last scene although it was not totally unexpected it was satisfying. I got what I wanted from that film. Thanks for giving me what i need, thanks for helping"
" Casting a Shadow
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,9,"Harsh. Demeaning. Unyielding. Perfectionist. These traits are that of J.K. Simmons' Terence Fletcher, the director of the top jazz band at a prestigious conservatory of music. Damien Chazelle's Whiplash, follows the course of a jazz musician under the tutelage of an often demanding instructor, leaving the audience to make a judgement on the effectiveness of such a teaching style. Much like its' young protagonist, Whiplash strives for perfection in portraying the trials and tribulations of a promising musician. While overshadowed by strong performance by Teller and Simmons, Whiplash's powerful cinematography and decisive musical choices represent a strong sophomore effort from director Damien Chazelle.Andrew Neiman is an aspiring jazz drummer at the prestigious (and fictitious) Shaffer conservatory of music. The movie opens on Neiman practicing rudimentary drills alone in a practice room in the dark of night. As Neiman increases the intensity of his drills, he looks up to notice he has company; Terence Fletcher, the instructor of the top band at the school. Though the audience is not yet aware, this scene mirrors the path of the entire film, with Neiman's best never seeming to be enough to satisfy the incessantly demanding Fletcher.After seeing Neiman play, Fletcher invites him to the top band at the school. In spite of the incredible talent of the musicians in the top band, at Neiman's first rehearsal he sees, and experiences firsthand Fletcher's often cruel and demanding teaching style. After brutally humiliating and demoting a trombone player, he turns to the newest member of the band. While initially Neiman remains determined and driven in his quest to be one of the greats, his determination begins to waver, and with it his respect for his teacher. This crescendos, so to speak, until Neiman snaps, attacking his teacher on stage at a competition. This conflict between the student and the teacher is maintained throughout the film, and is one of the defining characteristics.Simmons, who has demonstrated himself throughout his career to be an incredibly versatile actor, portrayed the intense and unforgiving Fletcher phenomenally throughout the film. From the very beginning of the film, Simmons' Fletcher casts an ominous presence on the screen, highlighted against the shadows of the hallway late in the practice room. Rather than your standard archetype of a always-mean teacher, Fletcher constantly shifts from seemingly kind and forgiving to cruel and demeaning at a moment's notice. This adds a depth and complexity to the character that is excellently portrayed through Simmons' performance.Teller, on the other hand, performs a more standard role, but still maintains a complexity and depth of character beyond other depictions. Ever the earnest, eager student, Teller's Neiman effectively conveys his drive to succeed through late night practice sessions, idolizing of drumming legends and most notably his bloodied hands. As the film goes on, though, it is clear to see Fletcher's presence and cruelty wearing on Neiman's dream, until finally Neiman snaps. Also notable is the Teller's extensive work in learning to play percussion for the film, and performing some of the scenes without the use of a background recording. While both Simmons and Fletcher's performances merit real praise, often overlooked are the complex directorial choices of director Damien Chazelle and the musical score of composer Justin Hurwitz. In the very opening scene, the stylistic choices of the director immediately casts Simmons' Fletcher as an imposing presence and establishes a somber and intense mood for the movie. As Fletcher steps out from the dark hallway, the camera angle is shot from a lower height, giving the hard-nosed director an immediate illusion of power and harshness. Another key example of these conscious directorial choice would be the rapid pans between Fletcher and Neiman in the final scene of the movie, as Neiman's solo gradually builds, the rapid pans inserting a sense of manic intensity into the scene to supplement the performances of the actors.Throughout the film, Hurwitz's score provides a tone and mood that is authentic to the style of jazz performed by the bands and dovetails effectively with the quiet intensity of the film as a whole. The title track, ""Whiplash"", a difficult 7/4 chart that is actually performed by many jazz ensembles, serves as a metaphor for the movie as a whole, with alternating piano and forte sections that seem to shift in volume every few seconds. Even the unnamed tracks that play in the background as Neiman travels between classes or overheard from other bands evoke a complexity and simmering undertones that belie the rising tension throughout, which comes to a climax in the final number, ""Caravan"". A 1936 jazz standard originally composed and performed by Duke Ellington, the hard-driving Latin number expresses the constant ambition of Neiman as he strives, and in the penultimate solo, finally pleases the demanding Fletcher. While the performances of both Teller and Simmons are admirable, the directing and composing elevate the film to an even higher level. The choices of Chazelle and Hurwitz grant the film an additional depth and emotion that further places the movie into the conversation for one of the best films of the year."
" the musician this time
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,6,"Another film that has its theme the writer, the musician, the actor, etc. I could find such films amusing if they had some sense of humor - well a lot of humor I'd say. Some spirit of self-reproach, admitting that there are things in this world more important than the writer the actor the performer etc. I prefer the other ballet dancer film a few years ago, it was more real more cruel. I prefer what Bergman used to do."
" Disturbing and a waste of time
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,1,"If this were to be a parody about success and how to achieve it, it would receive 10 stars from me. Unfortunately it is not and the high ratings it has achieved baffles me.Firstly, let me state that I do not understand music from a professional or enthusiast's point of view.In my opinion, the movie portrays music as a mastery of some technical skills, following a fixed(or slight variation thereof) tempo. It removes anything remotely positive involved in learning or teaching music. The main characters throughout the movie were only involved in inflicting pain on themselves or others in order to satisfy their ambitions.Secondly, no character development or a back story. All the characters came out the same at the end of the movie as they were in the beginning. The only change being Andrew could play better(yippe!).Thirdly, definition of success (of being a 'Great') and the path to it. The movie portrays success as a neurotic obsession with ambition(never music - never got that feeling, always about being up there) and a desire for proving people who have humiliated you as wrong as the road to it! What is wrong with people? In my opinion succeeding at something requires true passion and love for it. Yes pushing ourselves is required along the way, but if the entire journey consists of it, the feelings with which we will reach the other end would be a far cry from sunshine and rainbows.In brief the entire movie consists of a sadistic instructor fishing for a student who does not break when methods resembling whack-a-mole are employed and succeeding(YAY!)."
" A promising young drummer enrolls at a cut-throat music conservatory
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,10,Whiplash Much Like La La Land ( 2016 ) Is a Fantastic Film but unlike La La Land is far more serious which isn't a bad thing. Miles Teller Is Outstanding in this film probably his best performance yet although it's really unfortunate that his next big movie was the dreadful Fantastic Four ( 2015 ) reboot . Much like Miles Teller Jk Simons gives it his all and is one of if not the best performance of 2014.The music in Whiplash is outstanding. My full analysis of whiplash is that it is an amazing film 10/10.
" Excellent Music Filled Drama
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,10,"With the rise of his newest film ""La La Land"" I ventured back to what got Damien Chazelle's name in lights. ""Whiplash,"" or Chazelle's starring entrance film that won fifty plus awards nationally and internationally, is an amazing film incorporating both music and drama to create an incredible story of one's rise to fame. As an aspiring drummer, Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller) lands himself in the hot seat. Neyman was put there only by world renowned conductor and musical connoisseur Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) at an elite east coast musical conservatory. After being placed in Fletcher's top notch jazz band, Neyman finds himself constantly at war between being the best drummer and maintaining his sanity. In the dark with an absent mother and a poet for a father, Neyman wants to make a name for himself and his unforeseen talents. From the dialogue of Chazelle, there is an uneven yet critical balance of intense heart wrench with additions of disgusting humor that particularly adds to J.K. Simmons character. The plot, set in an almost unoriginal light, is captured with a dynamic new relationship between teacher and student. Broadcast in New York at a prestigious music driven school seems to be a common theme among rising millennials. Chazelle took this cliché and added in a layer of depth with a fight between choosing one's mental health or being a household name at the hands of one professor. In a word, Simmons can be described as fearless. The portrayal of an elite die-hard conductor skyrocketed with his bipolar personality tendencies. One minute you are awed and hypnotized by his presence and confidence and next you are wanting to run for cover from the cymbal he is trying to hurl at your head for rushing the tempo. The capabilities shown by Simmons to entice beautiful musicians to want to be in his band, to the blood of the failures he marks on the walls of the conservatory, want to make you pick up a set of sticks while also playing away your mental stability. A standing ovation and round of applause to Simmons and a well-deserved win for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. In a wild change of events, our hero seems to be a bit in the shadows, or should I say overshadowed, by his supporting cast. Teller seems a bit shy or timid when delivering a character who is supposedly not going to be scared by one egotistical, Satanist conductor. We experience the pain and suffering Neyman goes through when constantly beaten down or trying to prove himself by blistering up his hands and cutting off relationships with his loved ones. However, we miss the cutthroat shocking change in the end by a musical shift in power between the conductor and the musician in his last performance shown on screen. As an impeccable duo (in a hero-villain type of way) Teller and Simmons create an entirely vibrant drama that makes you feel alive. The work of Chazelle simply cannot be undermined with hit after hit in his musically combative story line and unbelievable emotional content."

" Whiplash
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,10,"A tense and emotional film with fantastic performances from Teller and Simmons; they are one of music's best chemistry in movie history. The script keeps pace with endless and exhilarating tension. Damien Chazelle instantly has my respect, being this his only second work. It is well driven behind pitch-point direction."
" So how much is too much?
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,9,"I put on a spoiler alert even though I'm not telling you how things go. There is no doubting the intensity of this film and the mano a mano between Teller and Simmons (who is flipping great). It raises the celluloid question of how much motivation for a student is too much? Simmons and Teller certainly explore the limits, as each gives up everything else in the grind towards perfection. I almost gave up several times myself because the intensity was more than I wanted to watch, but I did come back in the end. And it was a good thing I did because the ending literally makes the movie. Dare I say, the end is the only finale they could rightfully have. So hang in there because it's worth the trip."
" The tempo is just right.
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,10,"I had no idea what the film was about and therefore had no preconceptions. I wondered about watching it for the first few minutes but then became intrigued by the possibilities. Although it is based in a jazz situation, that is subsumed by the drama between and of the characters. As a genre it may not be original but the writing, directing and performances make it a standout film with a climax as tense and dramatic as any."
" Teacher steals the Show
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,8,"I really didn't know what to expect from this movie and after seeing it, I'm quite impressed. There are some real-life themes covered in the film and millions of people can relate to them. Every person who sat at a school desk at some point in their life can vividly remember their relation with at least one of their teachers. We remember teachers who influenced our lives in a good way or in a bad way. Is Terrence Fletcher, an experienced and highly appreciated music teacher at a prestigious music college, a good teacher? It's hard to say. *Spoilers* However, I think he did cross the line. Having witnessed the potential of a new, first-year drummer, Terrence Fletcher started a mission. A mission to push his student, to yell at him and embarrass him in front of his colleagues until he realizes he has to work harder and harder. Andrew Neyman, the student, also had a mission. He wanted to become a living legend in the world of music, somebody like Charlie Parker Bird. And, as Charlie's music teacher threw music instruments at him to motivate him and push him just a little bit further, so did Terrence Fletcher. He slapped the poor Andrew, insulted his family, mocked him, cursed him, forced him beyond his physical limits and played little games on him - never letting him know whether he would really get the role in the band. Does the end always justify the means? Even if one may say ""yes"" there is an additional tragic story in the film. A former Fletcher's student committed suicide because he couldn't handle the pressure and psychological torture. The official diagnosis was depression. This film gives us an interesting psychological game between very similar individuals but in very different roles. Both actors (Miles Teller and J.K.Simmons) played their roles in a marvelous way. However, it seems that the teacher's character is more developed and motivated. He's the one who is leading this game of ambition and a twisted strive for greatness. The student follows him, although his own over-ambition doesn't let him even think of giving up. Many interesting things to think about after seeing the film! And you don't really have to be a jazz fan."
" Blistering
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,9,"Nominated for five Oscars, and winning three (editing, sound and Best Supporting Actor, with nominations for screenplay and Best picture), 'Whiplash' is positively blistering, with a darker and more realistic view on aspirations and done in a way that's tense and inspirational.Visually, 'Whiplash' looks great with grittily atmospheric photography with plenty of beautiful, gripping shots (like close-ups of the drum playing) and some of the tightest, cleverest and most audacious editing of any film that year. The sound is also thrilling in its intense authenticity, and really add to the impact of the pulse-racing Jazz soundtrack. There is in particular unbelievable drum playing that serves as a fond reminder of iconic drum players of the classic Jazz Age, the final drum solo is long but exhilaratingly played and a huge part of why the ending sends up a storm as much as it does.The script is sharp and cutting, sometimes uncompromising and at other points patient. The story is not new, but makes a point of aspirations and talent having its dark and less glamorous side, competitiveness and that there are always obstacles (including dictatorial bullies). While not quite as extreme in life as shown here situations and people like seen in the film exist. The story is at its most successful in its tension between Andrew and Fletcher, which is thrilling and nail-biting, and Andrew's very relatable and inspiring drive and passion, and much of it is very taut and rarely laborious in pace.Damian Chazelle directs with a clear love for film and the jazz style and passion for the subject. 'Whiplash' has great performances all round. The secondary cast do much with little and Miles Teller more than holds his own in a telling lead performance. This is JK Simmons' film however, proving that his Oscar win was one of that year's most deserved wins. He doesn't just dominate the film with his ruthless manner as a terrifyingly dictatorial character, but actually IS essentially the film, one's terrified of him but also understands his point of view.'Whiplash' could have been slightly better this said. Most of the supporting cast, especially Andrew's family (the film at least tries to say why the romance was rushed and dropped, in that it didn't mean anything to him like his playing of music did), are severely underwritten and underused. The car crash scene and the aftermath also feels out-of-kilter and even the most committed musician wouldn't be in the right function to do what happens after that scene.Otherwise, this is a blisteringly great film with a huge amount to recommend. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
" Ba dumb bumb cheshhh!
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,10,"""Whiplash"" tells the story of Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller), a young drummer whose obsession is to become ""one of the greatest"" and who finds his match in Terence Fletcher, a conductor who put the ""mentor"" in ""monster"" and ""monster"" ""in maestro"" and will push Andrew to heights of unsuspected greatness and to the edge. For lack of a sequel, we'll never know if Andrew became the best drummer of his generation, but there's one thing we do know: Damien Chazelle is Oscar-nominated for ""La La Land"". If he wins (and he certainly will), he'll be the youngest Oscar-winning director of Hollywood history. And there's more: ""La La Land"" earned 14 Oscar nominations tying the record of ""Titanic"" and ""All About Eve"", and it is very likely that the film will tie the all-time records of Oscar wins, if not break them. And Chazelle isn't even thirty, he doesn't even look thirty. Only two years have passed between his directorial debut and the kind of wet dream for a vet director, let alone a ""squeaker"". So I'm not sure if I want to review ""Whiplash"", a fascinating coming-to-greatness story, or the story behind ""Whisplash"" which embodies the same nervously inspirational spirit. Actually, it is not a hazard that Chazelle made his bones through a movie about talent, ambition and discipline as he applied these vital life parameters to himself. How do I know that he's got talent? Is it subjective? I don't know. But there's an interesting moment that says all... when Fletcher visits Andrew's school band, looking for someone to pick.I'll pass over the mockeries and derogatory comments to the untalented players, so you have Andrew as the second drummer and not even appreciated, Fletcher lets the first drummer play, then Andrew. They play like one second each, yet these seconds are enough for Fletcher to detect the real potential. It seems that Andrew's got the little sparkle just enough to be considered a page-turner in Fletcher's conservatory, but it will be a long road till he earns his part or not. Now, has Chazelle talent? Well, judging by whatever was displayed in this film in terms of acting, directing, writing, editing, and even sound mixing, I would say, hell yeah! The 'squeaker' earned his part as one of the most promising directors of his generation.And ""Whiplash"" is a long road to greatness paved by the harrowing mind-wrestling between the fierce mentor and his ambitious disciple, and one of the most captivating love-and-hate relationships of recent years. And as painful or cringe worthy as it gets, we feel that harassment is the kind of ""end-justifying-the-means"" technique to go beyond expectations. Fletcher does have a point, and it's true that there's no good coming from casual complimenting. I myself remember a teacher who used to harass us in prep school, she could let me fill the blackboard for four uninterrupted hours and always commented the work we did by ""could have been better"" or ""pathetic"". One day, I managed to elicit a jaw-dropping ""very good"" and it was an extraordinary feeling. I wish sometimes I had someone harming me for the sake of my accomplishments.But now, I'm projecting my own experience in ""Whiplash"", while the film goes deeper in the enigmatic personality of Terence Fletcher. He believes in Andrew's talent but he doesn't like him for all that. Fletcher is an antagonist and the paradox is that his antagonism improves Andrew's talent more than anything. JK Simmons, who owned the Supporting Actor category during the awards season, is an instant icon in this film, and the way he loudly asks Andrew if he's dragging or rushing was so intense I felt like he was shouting at me. Fletcher shows us the key to self-accomplishment: not rushing and not dragging, seizing the right timing, the right tempo to get to action and secondly, an indirect lesson: no one owes anything and the least you expect from others, the more you expect from you.Andrew isn't perfect either, there's a moment where he breaks up with his new girlfriend, killing the relationship before it even started. He didn't want her to undermine his path as if he was convinced already he was going to be the greatest, embodying Muhammad Ali's classic ""I was the greatest before I knew I was"". But as admirable as his self-confidence is, the journey of Andrew doesn't go without a few 'accidents', some more deserved than others, and I wouldn't dare to spoil the third act which elevated the film from a fine Indie music to a fantastic duel of egos with drums and music and venomous rancor as weapons.""Whiplash"" is one duel after one, between rival drummers, Andrew and Fletcher, and ultimately Andrew and himself. He doesn't belong to a musical family, he has dreams, that alienated him from family and friends, but he knows if he was good enough to catch the ear of Fletcher, that might say a thing or two about his talent. Granted Fletcher isn't the nicest guy but nice guys aren't all talented or successful. So it all comes down to ""Whiplash""'s third act; a satisfying jazz crescendo culminating with a super finale where everything is beating, your feet are tapping and for one moment you do believe that jazz is the finest musical expression of all time after classical music.And maybe beyond ambition, talent and discipline, the reason why this awkward college boy-looking director made such a sensational impact, is because he knew about jazz, it was his passion. So maybe passion is the key. And he was so passionate that in order to get the money, he simply made a shorter version and submitted the film to Sundance, and the rest is history. Like a sort of ""Rocky"" with drums and its extraordinary ending, ""Whiplash"" is (simply said) the embodiment of its own success story.Ba dumb bumb cheshhh!"

" One of the greatest cinematic experiences in my life
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,10,"Whiplash takes the viewer on a beautiful journey with Andrew, making you feel all the emotions Andrew is going through. The jazz music throughout this movie helps in flow in a beautiful way. J.K. Simmons's performance is one of the greatest performances ever seen on the big screen and alone separates it from your average movie. Damien Chazelle does a great job in engaging the audience throughout the movie yet keep a chilling and captivating atmosphere. Miles Teller also puts in a great performance, making the audience feel as if he is a truly great musician and as an audience member you truly feel his pain and despair. Melissa Benoist also gives an excellent performance as the shy, quiet girlfriend of Andrew and we feel this relationship is extremely important. All in all I recommend everybody watch this movie as it will be a classic for sure, and J.K. Simmons's performance will be regarded as one of the greatest of all time."

" Review and Analysis of Whiplash
",2017-02-03 00:00:00,9,"Whiplash (2015) is a very riveting movie written and directed by Damien Chazelle. Whiplash is about young drummer named Andrew (Miles Teller) that is on a journey to become ""one of the greats"" in the jazz scene. Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) sees potential in Andrew and will ensure that Andrew is tested and pushed to his absolute limits, even if this means degrading him to the lowest level. Andrew will stop at nothing, not even Fletcher, to achieve his goal of becoming the next, Charlie Parker.The theme of Whiplash has a clear focus on character and his trials and tribulations to make it to the top. Andrew showed great determination throughout the movie. He literally practiced until he bled on the drums. Andrew was so consumed by his goal, he decided to break off his relationship with Nicole (Melissa Benoist) and told her he needed to dedicate more time to drumming. Even a car crash that injured him, did not hold him back from attempting to play a show. The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) directed by Martin Scorsese shared a similar character focused theme of Jordan Belfort's (Leonardo DiCaprio) strive towards greatness.There was one scene in Whiplash that was quite captivating. When Fletcher brought in Ryan (Austin Stowell) to compete against Andrew for head-seat and gave it to Ryan, the tension was thick in the air. The hand-held camera effect was used to provide shakiness to the scene when Andrew marched into Fletcher's office to demand his spot back. This showed the emotional distress of the scene and really brought it to life. The director liked to use many close-up and extreme close-up shots of Andrew throughout the movie. In particular, during his bouts of intense practice, the camera would show extreme close-ups of Andrew's hand bleeding and him applying Band-Aids to his wounds. There was a motif that was present throughout the whole movie. It was the passion and drive needed to succeed. How far would a person push themselves to achieve their goals?With the focus on Andrew, it allowed the viewers to build a relationship with him. Andrew's triumphs over his failures gave the viewers a sense of hope and determination, that they could achieve their goals with hard work and determination."
" Disturbing but definitely worth seeing.
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,7,"No synopsis of the film, just a summary of impressions.Some films stay with you for various reasons. After seeing this film a few days ago, I find that it is sitting in my head, just in the background where my subconscious continues to toy with it. Frankly it is a disturbing film with powerhouse performances by JK Simmons and Miles Teller. Worth seeing but be prepared for some unsettling content.There are lots of reviews that discuss the plausibility of a man like Fletcher existing in academia today or if one can really drum until your hands bleed.I don't think either issue matters from a thematic point of view of the film. Both of these aspects of the film could be attributed to dramatic license to convey a deeper meaning. This is how I approached this film while watching it and in this review.This does not mean I believe that the Fletcher character is implausible in real life. In fact, I don't think that this character is much of a dramatic stretch. Its pretty typical to see coaches and teachers in the arts bully their students. Growing up in a backwater midwest town I recall having a music teacher who employed tactics like Fletcher-- He threw temper tantrums for similar triggers as seen in this movie and tossed his baton, chair and music stand from time to time. One time I remember he even grabbed a student by the neck (a drummer in fact) and pushed him against the wall. Ahh, the good ole days of education in middle American. Anyway, suffice to say I think that this type of teacher or coach is a plausible reality. The scenes of Andrew pushing himself to and beyond the his limits are a bit unbelievable with the blood and wounds and all. Implausible yes, but I think this was an intentional device to convey a deeper meaning so that no one could miss it. All of these scenes are effective in conveying the one big theme in this film---only pain creates great art.This theme seems to prevail in the arts and there is much evidence to support it if you look at the biographies of the great painters, novelists, etc. Pain is a great motivator to inspire and change human behavior. I think that this idea rather romanticizes the suffering that many great artists experienced during their lifetimes . And perhaps this idea seems ingrained in the arts because its such an effective sales pitch for these artists work postmortem. Anyway, whether or not pain is necessary for great art will probably be debated for eons to come. This theme in the movie was not that interesting to me. I guess I should note that the film does take a position on this issue, coming down firmly on the side that pain is necessary to bring out artistic greatness.Okay, so the big obvious theme of the movie did not intrigue me. Yet, there is something that intrigued me about this film, something I found very unsettling and set me about writing this review. This film offers a rather realistic portrayal of the systematic abuse employed by someone who fits the profile of a sociopath or narcissist fairly well. Support for this conclusion: Fletcher manipulates his students and Teller's character in particular from the very first scene. He puts Teller's character Andrew through a cycle of idealization and devaluation again and again. He gas lights Andrew again and again. He systematically uses triangulation to manipulate Andrew. These are the tactics of a textbook narcissist.In this same vein, Andrew is the perfect victim. We see him lose each and every personal boundary, including one that would induce him to care for his own survival after being seriously injured in a car accident.Why does Andrew do this? Its all an effort to receive approval from Fletcher. Andrew is the perfect victim in this film. And his path in the film takes him to the place where many victims end up when tangling with this type of human being.In the finale where Fletcher sets up Andrew for the ultimate humiliation for the sole purpose of vengeance, I found this to be one of the most chilling things I've seen on screen in a long while. For me, the film should have ended right there as this is what can happen when you tangle with a narcissist.The film continues after this scene. We see a wild performance and Andrew seems to get what he has sought from Fletcher from the very beginning of the film. It feels a bit like a tacked on scene, like something that was forced on the story--a typical Hollywood feel good ending that was probably added to make the project more palatable to a test audience or producers. Given the nature of the characters as portrayed in this film, the ending would not end up in feel good land. Rather, it would likely end up as the Casey character mentioned in the film---Fletcher's prodigy who eventually hung himself."

",2017-02-02 00:00:00,9,"Simply amazing. Acting and production was done great! I can relate to this movie because I'm a drummer as well. Well rounded film altogether. I'm glad they picked an amazing group of casts and the production team and cinematography is very promising. I highly recommend this film for die hard filmmakers, musicians, and just views that love films and what can come out of a great story such as this. I am also glad this received some awards that was definitely necessary. The drumming was especially awesome by Miles Teller and the aggression of the teacher was crazy good. Definitely a great duo in this film. I hope to see more and more films being produced like this everyday or at least every year that gives you a good sense of industry and taste."
" Why I think this is the best film of 2014
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,10,"Now I know a lot of people are gonna disagree with me on this, but I think that this is the best film of 2014 (and Birdman is not) Why? I feel like I got more out of this film, I thought it had a much more clever script, and this seems like the kind of movie that can inspire people with the smallest of hopes. Don't get me wrong, I think Birdman is a 10/10, but this was more of a 10/10 I suppose, with Birdman I well definitely give credit where credit is due, like the acting and cinematography were top notch, it's amazing how it was done in one shot (i know it actually wasn't, you don't have to tell me) But I feel like Whiplash will accompany my thoughts long after seeing it, just cause of how complex it is, maybe I didn't understand Birdman, and when I do I'll change my mind, right now this is not the case. Whiplash is amazing"
" House of Whipcord is probably better
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,3,"I MUST have watched the wrong movie. The reviews for this film could in no way apply to the contrived claptrap I've just seen. Perhaps the positive reviews here were intended for that 1974 masterpiece House of Whipcord. The movie called Whiplash that I saw stars J.K. Simmons as Terence, a music teacher who can slap a face with such force as to make General Patton wince. The film also stars Miles Teller as Andrew, a student of Terence's who yearns to learn from him how to properly play the drums. Andrew accomplishes this by volunteering to let his teacher play the bongos on his face.I won't say that Damien Chazelle's direction is heavy-handed, but I would probably prefer to stick my head in Andrew's bass drum during the climactic scene than to endure watching said scene again.A word of advice to anyone considering seeing this film; go to YouTube instead and do a search for Buddy Rich. You will see the greatest drummer ever, and spare yourself the agony of viewing this over-the-top, trite, clichéd, eye-roll inducing effort. Your eyes and your ears will thank you for it."
" Bad Movie That Will be Supported by Musical Fans
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,5,"A movies about a student and teacher relationship that is completely one-sided. This movie is completely uneventful and unrealistic. Nothing actually happens in this movie other than yelling and redundant practicing. We are given no background on why this is so important or what prestige this kid is ultimately following by taking abuse by this music teacher. To think that a music teacher would ever lay hands on a student in this day in age is ridiculous. If it set the context and setting, I may believe it. Other than that, big deal.Why this movie has such a high rating is beyond me. This movie has motivated me to create a membership so that I can try and turn down the high rate it currently holds. Thank you Whiplash."
" Exhilarating, astounding and electrifying.
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,10,"So. I have seen many great films in the passing years, but this was something of a kind. There are many other films that would deserve a review, but i have decided not to write them. This however got me so hyped up that i just had to write this.It may not be the highest rated movie in my list, but it is really rare for me to give 10 stars. This movie will not be joining those few movies, but i'm still going to give recognition to this one by letting it be the first movie i ever wrote a review about.The reason for that is simple. This was amazing movie that had incredible acting and a very dark, but highly interesting plot. The characters had depth in them and the movie itself gave you many ways to interpret it. And for me, that is a very important thing. Many of the movies that give you more than one way to interpret it are on the way to become classics. Usually it is the ending, but in this one there is many scenes through out the movie.In Whiplash, i mostly mean the ending of the movie like i just stated, but the spark for that incredible ending scene comes through the entire film. Which is just great.I also have to give credit to the acting in this movie. J.K. Simmons is in my opinion one of the best actors in the world right now. I am also not quite sure if this movie would have had that high impact it had on me if he wasn't in this one. Just fantastic.In my opinion this should have been the academic award winning best picture from 2014. After all this is quite possibly one of the best movies of the decade."
" Utterly mystified by the high rating for what is a terrible film
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,2,"The only thing I can find to recommend this is the acting of both principles and possibly the drumming skills of Teller. Firstly, the idea that drumming can be made into the fine art Fletcher is pretending it can is ludicrous. While the director is to be commended on avoiding the usual Hollywood happy ending, the way it does culminate just leaves the viewer feeling entirely nonplussed.Even some of Andrew's reactions to Fletcher's behaviour are not realistic. It is similarly hard to credit that such an individual could be allowed keep his job in today's ultra-litigious world.A complete waste of time. Avoid."
" One of the best movies I have ever seen
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,10,"you should be shocked when you find out that this is only the second movie for a 30-year-old guy. then you become assured that he is the future of Hollywood and also the future of musical movies which has been always dead.Damien Chazelle made the best musical movie ever with only $3,300,000 budget. I think he deserved an Oscar nomination but it's his first masterpiece so it's not a shock for me.J.K. Simmons the actor who rises in his 60th and does the role of his life and totally deserved the Oscar. When you first hear that Miles Teller is the main character you think that it's a miscasting but he totally nailed it and proved that he is a really good actor.And I have to talk about the film editing and sound mixing which were epic and blended us with the movie and the music.My rating is 10/10."
" What's the point of this film and why do people like it so much?
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,4,"The good: The outstanding performances of Miles Teller as Andrew and J.K Simmons as Fletcher. They both were incredible in their parts and it seemed as if they gave their best in portraying the two male leading roles. The film surely wouldn't be the same if it wasn't for these two to lift it off. I also liked the fact that this film pays tribute to jazz music which is so overlooked in this age and time.The bad: Pretty much everything else. It seems like the initial goal of this film is for us to sympathize with the protagonist and share his ambition. We are supposed to like him, admire him for his persistence and cheer for him as he is trying hard to succeed in what he wants the most. But soon, we discover that Andrew's character is a self- centered, self-righteous, arrogant guy who thinks he is the best musician that has ever existed just because it is his ambition to become one. He hurts everyone else's feelings and diminishes them because he seems to believe he is more talented than them (as if it's him who decides that). For example, when he tells the girl he was supposed to be dating, that he does not want to date her anymore because she will slow him down, she asks him if that is because she said she doesn't know what she wants and he is positive. Which means that in his mind, just because he has found a thing he is passionate about, he is superior to the girl, who hasn't found a hobby or career path. Before that, when he is at the dinner table, he seems agitated because his family is not always talking about him and his drumming thing. He tries to change the subject back to his drumming and proceeds to diminish their talent because he really does think they will never amount to him. Which means that although he doesn't like the emotional abuse he is receiving from his teacher, he likes mentally abusing other people. Furthermore, I do not clearly understand what this film is trying to prove or make us believe. That it is okay to be emotionally scarred for life if some teacher says it's for your sake? Are we supposed to be relieved when the teacher reveals he is being cruel only to motivate the students to be the best and say ''Okay, he wasn't that bad of a person'' because I don't think that's a sane thing to do. The way to motivation should not (and is illegal to) include battering the students, calling them names, using their family background to verbally abuse them and insulting them in numerous ways. So, even if the teacher thought that was the way to make them better, it does not make him a better person. It makes him a monster. What's even worse is that Andrew seems to like his teacher in a weird way. He knows he is a good teacher and an even better musician so he is trying to look up to him and be the next Charlie Parker. Which means, he has to be as mean and as selfish as his teacher already is so that the teacher finally gives him his blessing. Is that what we want our kids and fellow men to do? Can't someone be the greatest musician ever without being an arrogant guy that puts other people down and admires the wrong kind of people? Couldn't Andrew just be humble and a nice person with the same persistence and drive? Another thing that really angered me off is how Andrew is indecisive. He swings from wanting to kill his teacher to cooperating with him to get him to like him. He confesses that his teacher is verbally abusing everyone in his class, he knows that the teacher's ways have led to someone's suicide so it looks as if he understands how bad of a person Fletcher actually is. Then he talks to Fletcher, plays with him at the festival as if there is nothing wrong whilst still admiring him as a teacher and musician. And after he finds out his former teacher has betrayed him by ordering a new song he didn't know, he leaves enraged, only to return to his drum set and give everything he's got....Is he suffering from bipolar personality disorder or is he just not sure of what he wants in life?Overall, I did not like much in this film. Sure the performances of Teller and Simmons were something else and the cinematography is brilliant but in the end, this film should not be anyone's favorite."
