" A New Christmas Classic, Look Out ""Die Hard""
",2020-11-19 00:00:00,10,"I know a lot love to boast and harp on about Die Hard being THE Christmas movie, and that's fair because it actually does invoke sincere feelings of the holiday season. On top of that, it's entertaining from beginning to end. Honestly, it's ONE of my favorite holiday flicks. It's never been my absolute fave, though. My favorite, ever since my brother and our friends saw it at our small town theater as kids, was always Scrooged. I still love it, but the last couple years I've found myself drawn more and more to Sean Baker's 2015 Tangerine. It has the fast paced rush and shocking violence of an action film, but it's also really funny. And it's refreshingly not funny in a way where you see some gag or joke set up for minutes before the supposed punchline hits. When this movie is funny it's a surprise sucker punch that almost makes your laughter come out as more a surprise gasp, because there is a lot of WTF behavior, WTF scenarios, and the dialogue is loaded with quotable whip quick smart-ass one liners. Okay, so I know a lot of movies are action packed, shocking, or funny, but most come at the expense of having to exist in completely artificial and not at all relatable world. This movie 100% exists in OUR real world. It's feels real and at times you wonder if any of it is improvised because of how naturally acted it is. Having said that, none of it, despite reportedly being filmed with a retro fitted iPhone, looks like a documentary: this is pure cinema and if you're a fan of seeing LA at magic hour, this movie will be a feast for your eyes. I'm kinda guessing maybe that's why it's actually titled ""Tangerine"" because its certainly not the name of any character in the film. But, yes, there are tangerine dream skies galore and it's gorgeous. This movie perfectly captures that golden time of Los Angeles winter days where the glow from the setting sun seems to start blazing up everything with orange sunlight around three in the afternoon until it's faded to just a purplish, graying sky by quarter to six. The first half of the move takes place during this time of the day and then the last half is the cold Christmas Eve of an LA night. There's decorations, there's lights, there are some gatherings, there's betrayal, there's heartbreak, there's tragedy, and then, above all, there is, in the most hopeless and unlikeliest places, the enduring friendships some have to hold on to with dear life because it's all they have. As one character bitterly laments in one scene someone mentions contacting family: ""what family?"" This movie is a celebration of that only type of family those unfairly ostracized lonely humans that society relegates to the fringes have: chosen family."
" So entertaining
",2020-10-15 00:00:00,8,The cinematography was a lil nauseating but other than that we love
" A film that bursts with life
",2020-09-27 00:00:00,8,"Also known as the movie that was shot entirely on iPhone 5s. But Sean Baker's 'Tangerine' explores female friendship through the eyes of two Los Angeles transgender prostitutes. Baker's direction and the performances makes it very funny, weirdly heartfelt, and seriously enjoyable. The quieter moments in the film therefore carry an unexpected emotional weight. A film that bursts with life."
" Amazing Movie That Unfortunately Doesn't Speak to Me Personally
",2020-08-07 00:00:00,6,"I wish i liked this more than i do, six stars don't feel enough for a movie that shines light on an unfortunately heavily underrepresented group while stunning with more than solid performances and well-written dialogues.
for some reason, even though i normally empathize very easily with any character in a film, i personally just couldn't really connect with any of the characters in this movie. the plot felt a little full to me, and a lot of scenes made me unbelievably anxious because of the constant screaming and noisy soundtrack, and although it's obviously part of the artistic vision, it just didn't really do it for me.
it's astonishing that this was filmed on iphones though; once again proof that you don't need expensive cameras or equipment to make a movie. the cinematography was brilliant, and sean baker is obviously a genius, can't wait to check out more of his work!
and i loved the ending!!"
" Trans-Film
",2020-06-19 00:00:00,9,"It's too rare of a feat in motion pictures when form perfectly matches content. When achieved, as in ""Tangerine,"" it's to be celebrated. Traditional film has been increasingly undermined for years now in the digital age, with film itself no longer the primary material of the art form, as has the theatrical setting of cinema by various home screens, video and streaming services. Shot on an iPhone, ""Tangerine"" is a transgressive picture. It's an apt choice of media for a movie about transgender women, as well as lower-class prostitution, drug addiction and immigration--all atypical subjects to the mainstream box office. The great irony here may be that the transgender characters are themselves illustrative of form and content mismatched, identifying as of female gender and marked by male sexual organs, but it seems perfectly fitting to a movie made on a phone.Another irony here is that the plot is invigorated by the lack of a phone, as Alexandra explains to Sin-Dee that she had to pay rent instead of for phone service. There hardly being pay phones in modern society anymore, either, Sin-Dee must hence walk the streets looking, rather than calling them, for her allegedly cheating boyfriend and the cisgender woman he's supposedly having an affair with. Yet, this is quite felicitous to the spirit of being photographed by phone, that the picture be as mobile as the mobile device it's recorded by. Although, it does seem the filmmakers go out of their way to not feature or mention mobile phones after the opening scene. Pointedly, the immigrant taxi driver doesn't work for Uber and isn't shown to be employing GPS from his phone. When he chases after Sin-Dee or his mother-in-law chases after him, they don't make calls; they take to the streets--either by foot or by cab. Just as Sin-Dee does in the wonderfully energetic opening sequence. Those shots prove how well photographed a mobile-phone movie can be. Of course, the catchy soundtrack helps.Another striking element of ""Tangerine"" is how apparent it makes it that gender and sexuality are performative, whether cis or trans, prostitute, or married cab driver. It's fitting, too, then, that this picture be set in Hollywood and that Alexandra performs on stage by singing at a club. And instead of movie stars, we see prostitutes, inside automobiles hiding in alleys and car washes rather than studio backlots, but the illusion and performance of it all remains the same. Everything in ""Tangerine"" seems to naturally fit and yet be at odds: being transgender, paying for sex, paying to perform, cheating and monogamy, Armenian beside English, drama next to doughnuts, Christmas in sunny Los Angeles, a world absent phones inside of a phone, a film not involving actual film, cinema viewed more often on personal small screens instead of a theatre (personally, I streamed it on my laptop). There may be those who don't recognize it as such, as with the transphobia directed towards the protagonists, but ""Tangerine"" is a natural and felicitous motion picture regardless--even because of the media it was born by. Even the picture's central friendship and its fleeting betrayal between Alexandra and Sin-Dee works on this level. It's with them that the picture wisely begins and ends."
" Outrageous
",2020-06-04 00:00:00,8,"This film is very brash, confrontational and outrageous, which may not be for everyone. However, it is very rewarding. The characters come from a different world from the audience but they gain our sympathies, despite their flaws. The cinematographic style makes it feel down-to-earth."
" Almost Tragic
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,8,"I liked this movie. It was sad, but life affirming. It follows some prostitutes around on Christmas Eve. At times, it is funny, and it feels very real. It mostly follows one of the prostitutes who is looking for a woman who was with her man while she was in jail. When she finds the girl, she drags her across the city to confront the pimp. It doesn't sound like a lot of story, but it is full of a lot of life. It's not one of those movies that are low in ideas and have to stretch things out to fill its runtime; this one is full, from start to finish."
" Raw and engaging
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,6,"A portrait of a group of individuals on Christmas Eve in Tinseltown; particularly on a transgender lady who is on the warpath for a pimp who cheated on her while she was away. The main marketing point for this one is that its shot entirely on an iPhone and it really is technically impressive with it having a sun-drenched visual style and some quite beautiful photography. It's well shot and well directed with the performances standing out above all as they are so key to the drama; Kitana Kiki Rodriguez and Mya Taylor are fantastic as the central friends and the thing that makes this film tick is their relationship and how intimate we get with the characters thanks to their acting and the filming techniques. It is a tough watch as it is set in a seedy world with unpleasant characters and you won't necessarily want to watch it twice. Even the two central ladies who we root for most of the time have questionable moments but it is a pretty realistic depiction of people affected by their intense surroundings. It reaches levels of hysteria which are darkly funny particularly towards the end in a coffee shop scene that is nuts. There are a couple of moments which are genuinely sweet however, particularly the scene where we finally see Alexandra sing with her best friend watching which is really well done. Overall, worth a watch but prepare for a challenging experience"
" Glad I Finally Watched This
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,10,"When I found out this film was shot on 3 iPhones I thought, it's not going to look professional, well, I was wrong. Tangerine is an excellent film filled with great performances from everyone. Kudos to Clu Gulager who made a brief but wonderful appearance as the Cherokee, fare in Razmik's cab. While this movie may not be to everyone's tastes, it involves a couple of transgender prostitutes and there is some pretty nasty violence as one of the prostitutes drags a cis gender prostitute around town in order to confront her pimp/boyfriend over his infidelity with her.
This is LA with the gloss off, this is the other side of the city. Pimps, Prostitutes, transgender, drugs, booze, homosexuality and violence. This is as realistic as it gets.
The story also weaving through it is Razmik, an Armenian cab driver who is attracted to trans prostitutes, even leaving his family on Christmas Eve to go to Alexandra's, one of the trans prostitute's singing performance. It all culminates in a huge confrontation between Sin-Dee Rella, her pimp Chester, Dinah the cis prostitute that Sin-Dee has dragged around and abused, Razmik's mother-in-law, who suspecting that something is up has followed her son-in-law with the help of another cab driver, Karo and finds him with the prostitutes who then calls her daughter who arrives with their infant daughter. All the while the Asian owner of the donut shop is threatening to call the police. This scene is absolutely hilarious and really very poignant as Razmik's wife, Yeva has actually been turning a blind eye to what her husband has been up to.
While I found the violence against Dinah, the cis prostitute pretty ugly, (and Alexanda telling Sin-Dee that she did not have to 'Chris Brown the bitch"") pretty funny, (yes, I know,) it doesn't shy away from the uglier side of human nature. There were a few touching moments, Sin-Dee turning up for Alexandra's performance when no one else did, dragging Dinah along, Sin-Dee doing Dinah's make up in the bathroom. Alexandra looking after Sin-Dee after she was abused and had urine thrown at her from some thugs in a car even though Chester had revealed that he had sex with Alexandra while Sin-Dee was in jail. Dinah returning to the brothel to be told there was no place for her, and her sitting dejectedly on the doorstep.
Kitana Kiki Rodriguez as Sin-Dee Rella, and Mya Taylor as Alexandra were absolute standouts and I would highly recommend this movie."
" Comedic, Odd, and Human
",2019-11-26 00:00:00,9,"Tangerine is a really unique movie. It is about a transvestite hooker fresh out of prison who finds out that her pimp/boyfriend has been cheating on her while she was away, with an actual woman. This sends her on a path of revenge that intersects with the story of an Armenian cab driver with a family, who has a fetish for dudes that look like ladies. If it sounds like an out there movie that is because it is.It starts off hilariously and fast paced with the man-lady, street named Sin-Dee, walking around fuming while her friend Alexandra tries to calm her down. The best parts of this movie are the strange interaction the main characters have with random street folk. These interactions really made the movie for me, it is not the main storyline is weak, its just that this illumination of a certain kind of subculture was so interesting that anytime even the smallest of characters came onto the screen to talk to our heroine it was fascinating to watch. I especially loved Sin-Dee's interaction with all the other tyranny's on the street.The movie is aided by a talented and believable cast, who humanizes these otherwise somewhat cartoonish characters. By the end of the film the director achieves a tremendous range in emotion from all the primary characters. I was laughing almost the entire first half of the movie but by the end I was quite dour. It weaves between lighthearted zaniness and grounds itself in real human anguish.In the end tangerine was just a wild ride that feels so different where so many movies feel so the same. It shines a reflective light on an otherwise ignored part of society splashing flashes of real humanity into hilariously farfetched situations and discussions. Tangerine is a film that should be seen by anyone who appreciates films that do something different, and it manages to avoid an air of pretentiously that often accompanies this film. If you can appreciate that, you will enjoy this ride."
" Walked Out Of Theatre
",2019-11-22 00:00:00,1,"Besides the non existant script, it was just terrible filmmaking. You could see booms and crew shadows from the begining. There was this ugly filter over everything to make up for the fact that it was filmed with only natural light and on an iPhone. This isn't being economical, it is just being lazy. A film about such heavy content could get funding so easily, but they decided to stick with iPhones, and decided that learning how to use a camera was for suckers. High schools make better films. With the lighting, it was all natural - no artistic input at all. Production design was non existent because they were almost always filming in public. I DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT THE FILMMAKERS ACTUALLY DID IN THIS FILM. You can run around with your iphone, but that just makes you as good as every kid nowadays. The acting, it was intolerable. They didn't articulate, or project, and because the boom op didn't know what they were doing/wasn't recording, it was impossible to understand these women. Just terrible. Nothing good to it. Save your time."
" Worse than a skit done by 12-year-olds
",2019-11-22 00:00:00,1,"We tried really hard to watch this. From the first scene in the diner, it was evident that this was going to be bad, and it went downhill from there. The acting, filming and dialogue were juvenile at best, much like a skit kids come up with at lunchtime and perform for their friends.It is the first film I've walked out of mid-way in decades having decided I'd rather waste the price of our tickets than waste any more time."
" Hmm
",2019-11-11 00:00:00,7,"Now, this film probably deserves 8 stars. Though it's still teetering on the line.What an experience. I'm not too familiar with the LGBT movies. I haven't seen Brokeback Mountain. I did watch Philadelphia and some of I Love You Phillip Morris. This is one raw movie though, I'll give you that. It's a hard hitting experience that's as gritty as any movie out there. To a certain extent, but really. Whoa.So this movie is about a tranny, who is hunting down her pimp, because he's sleeping with another girl. She finds the girl, and drags her across LA to find the pimp. They stop by at a karaoke on the way to watch another trannies performance. Then they all go to a donut shop where the pimp is. And everyone goes their own ways after that, except the two trannies stick together. And all the women/trannies are prostitutes.Now, what could I say about this movie. Mark Duplass made this movie, and he's pretty good. Seeing that when I went into the movie, I was a little more comfortable. It's one gritty film, that's all I could say. It's really rough and tough. These trannies really have some life. Their experiences are just different. It's weird.The music is also pretty darn good. The filmmaking is cool and modern. I don't know, aside from the tranny stuff which I am not comfortable watching, this was a pretty damn good film.7 stars (Might deserve 8)"
" A fan, definitely
",2019-10-04 00:00:00,7,"This was just a complete free for all! I didn't know about this film until watching The Florida Project. This was moving in just the same way. I liked these people and I disliked these people. I was fully invested. Point being, I cared about them as PEOPLE. I saw Starlet as well a while ago, but it didn't grab me like this and Florida. More, please."
" The hundred dollar movie goes a lot farther today
",2019-06-03 00:00:00,1,"Its miracle is you go in expecting the iphone thing and the first scene is very much the 00s digital hundred dollar movie, but then it tricked you going straight into the virtuoso neo-slamdance phenom. There is a thick smudge of imagination covered the atrocious and bizarre surroundings on the same plane as the rest of us that can only disturb. The tangerine is the ball of the film soaked like a fruit. Now I see it being a millennial call to arms, but the hypocrisy of these works is the inspiration of empathy is its out, while its function is for our cultural elites and institutions as art as some sociological study, is hard not to see the condescension. What can we mine from the underclass? The effect is often contrary to the impulse to celebrate the different. Being a comedy is its out. The constant it being Christmas like a humid sweaty July points to nothing connects to the markers that are guideposts the rest live by except in the vaguest sense, so anything goes. Imagination is an invisible hat with a spring coming out its front and people follow it. The film's agile and gritty nature as Herzog said to learn to make films become an athlete not a cinephile, pursue these lost compasses moving in circles rotating around a donut shop. When directors make agile works, they discover agility reads. The performance imagination does the staging so then it's that anything can capture performance. Now I guess my skepticism is I love freak cinema made by freaks, Korine is a schizoid deviant, Herzog is frighteningly insane. So I question both Tangerine's goodness and its edges; would it be film students punching down, but then its sanity shows its bowtie points on family and such--the circus borrows from theater but the theater and circus are cousins and when they meet so cleanly the laurels might follow but who is it for? See how the police let them all be. No one is really bad. The donut shop lets them work it all out. There is, somehow, a timidity to this and a desire to behave for the laurels putting it all into question. This is not to mention the shorthand of its engagement which is like Cops; if this sort of trainwreck went around us we'd be glued to it as well, so creating a virtual digital cinema around is the effect of a precious snowglobe of trash, the warhol/basquait in the golden frame. I get why the millennials chose this as their thing but I feel they were duped by a carefully and intentionally crafted exercise."
" Stage play in LA
",2019-05-12 00:00:00,6,"Movie night with Iris.Yes Tangerine was shot on an iPhone, but i marveled more at the visuals, soundtrack, humour and pathos.The film is shot in an LA sunset glow. It is frequently very funny but in the City of Angels its protagonists are all lost souls. It's freewheeling, improvisatory style stumbles to the donut shop finale. This is spectacular, along the lines of a John Osborne stage climax."
" A real gem
",2019-04-22 00:00:00,9,"Sean Baker's 2015 film ""Tangerine"" is an absolute gem. It's fiction but it could be fact as we get a glimpse of the seamier side of LA on Christmas Eve as Baker follows a couple of transgender hookers aound, one of whom is looking for her unfaithful boyfriend. Then there's the Armenian cabdriver just looking for what, in less enlightened times, might have been called, 'a chick with a dick'. It's funny but mostly it's sad and, as one of the hookers, has in Mya Taylor, a real find. It's not an easy watch but it established Baker as a director of considerable promise, a promise effortlessly fulfilled with ""The Florida Project"", making him one of the most exciting talents in the independent section right now."
" Almost Great
",2019-03-05 00:00:00,7,"Some odd filmmaking choices in the first third of the movie hamper the tempo and immersiveness which is partially fixed in the final act.The movie is at its weakest when establishing and following the character of Sin-Dee while she is on her warpath. The strange angles & loud dubstep music really make it difficult to establish a connection to a character that is not very sympathetic in the first place.However when the camera follows her friend Alexandra or Razmik, it's essentially a different, far superior film, which really encapsulates the experience of these marginalised groups of people and shows us their struggles in a sympathetic way (which is the director's specialty if his masterpiece The Florida Project is any indicator).Liked: -some characters
-the culmination and endingDisliked: -the odd filter choice, especially since it's filmed in a location that has what seems to be the ideal lighting for the aesthetic the filmmakers are going for
-Sin-Dee's portion of the film6.5"
" World is cruel
",2019-02-25 00:00:00,9,Sincerely I didn't ever think about the people like sin-dee lives.. it's a movie that not only expressing tangibleness of them but the normal feelings and the things society failed to gave them..It's so frietening to think about what a 12 year gay child will face in our world...I'm not really this deep thinker but the movie made me one. The writting wins none can escape from this nice mess
" Some Crazy Drama
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,7,"Can't believe what I just watched
A little overhyped when it came out but still a very impressive movie
Can't wait to check out the Florida project next"
" OMG! I absolutely adore this one!
",2018-12-18 00:00:00,10,OMG! I absolutely adore this one! The mean streets of WEHO never looked so inviting and delicious. Miss the good times. MUAH. xo
" THE BEST FILM I HAVE EVER WATCHED...
",2018-11-03 00:00:00,10,"Or one of the best! I would much rather watch this than a bunch of cars going up in flames. Also, loved the Florida Project by the same director. Please check it out: The Florida Project. You will not regret watching either of these. If you are in the mood for an indie that also teaches you something you didn't know these films are for you!"
" The ending makes it worthwhile
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,10,"I'll take gritty realism , complete with its raucous, tender, risible and utterly hilarious moments, over play it safe Hollywood pap anytime. Like some other great films, one really only finds out what it's all about in the closing scene."
" Tech View
",2018-05-11 00:00:00,8,"Maybe most people love watching movies but never look at the tech side. The producer has extraordinary capabilities and creative incentives and saying this, this movie was actually filmed on an iphone 5S! Brilliant work!"
" Plain old misogyny filmed on an iPhone
",2018-04-28 00:00:00,1,"Apparently, filming transgender prostitutes (who can't act) angrily traipsing around the street, threatening violence and calling women ""fish"" and ""bitch"" every two seconds, is now considered ""art"".Unfortunately, it is actually just the same old tedious misogyny we've all been bombarded with since the dawn of time, with the added insult of being very poorly executed, and I'm utterly bored by it. When are we all going to stop accepting the very basic and juvenile woman-hating crap in every second song and film? Why can barely any film maker or ""artist"" create something truly unique and new? Why is hardly anyone pointing out that the dialogue is downright hate speech? I'm disgusted by the positive reviews on this pathetic, lazy, terrible, misogynistic, joke excuse for art. Created by a white male wannabe auteur. Of course! I am a white male, and I want my white male film making brethren to know that this kind of navel-gazing, tryhard ""edgy"" film making is pure cringe that should be burnt in a garbage fire, then pissed on. Make a genuine effort next time, you thoughtless, self indulgent POS."
" Sensational
",2018-04-16 00:00:00,9,Loved this movie. All around brilliant- Strong characters. Really hilarious at times. It's like being on an amusement park ride as these characters go through their everyday melo drama. Much better than the Florida Project. I could appreciate the unapologetic renegade characters in this movie but it just didn't work for me watching those kids in F. Project. This was brilliant.
" My name is Sin-Dee and I am the filthiest person alive
",2018-03-12 00:00:00,7,"Borne in the crack pipe dreams of transgender prostitutes is where this movie starts and finishes. And in between it bathes in its feces with the most superlative vanity. It etches obscene graffiti into donut shop tables and it shoots heroin in taxi cabs that reek of vomit. It masturbates in public. It flashes people in the park. It rivals even the reigning champ of filthiness, Pink Flamingos, but it takes the story telling element a step further in delivering an important message about the American Dream perceived by the lowest of the low - the outcasts of society. Even the people you're embarrassed to know want to climb that ladder, and I feel this movie voices those characters in an incredible way. Kitana Kiki Rodriguez as Sin-Dee wants a loyal husband and a normal life where she can support herself. Mya Taylor wants to become a recognized singer and performs a Christmas show every year. And Karren Karagulian moved to the US from Armenia to support his family and explore his sexuality. Each visionary gives an incredible performance, and each captures that feeling of that one crazy person you might see on the street somewhere. The chaotic energy of this movie is definitely heightened by the frantic camerawork, or rather phonework I guess because it's well known by now that this was filmed entirely on just three iPhone 5s's (which definitely add to the grimy and modern feel. It's probably the best choice Baker could have made to present this film. It feels like some random fight scene put up on Worldstar, filmed by an audience of phones with cracked screens; it's just how things are in this age and it was a brilliant move) which attempts to keep up with the drives of the characters, especially Rodriguez. I will say that a lot of the movie around and the jumping from polar opposites in tone and just scenarios gave me some mild nausea, and it gave an air of being unfocused. The powerhouse starts strong and also finishes strong, but it did lose some steam in the center making the film feel a little longer than it really was. Cutting out some fat and perhaps following some scenes out completely before switching to something new could make this movie I love. When Baker lets scenes like the showdown at Donut Time just breathe and play them to their extent, giving them the perfect Lubitsch Touch, it really is some kind of dark magic."
" Delicious :D
",2018-02-21 00:00:00,8,"Love, loss, tantrums, breakups and break ins! Loved it! Watch it! It's simply beautiful and gorgeous ... :D"
" 90 minutes with annoying people
",2018-01-15 00:00:00,6,"Tangerine: Directed by Sean Baker and written by Sean Baker and Chris BergochI decided to check this movie as I'm interested in The Florida Project. I have not had the chance to see that movie but have never seen any of this director's work. The reviews mention to see Tangerine if you can as well. I really shouldn't have though. This movie tried to bring little bits of humanity to characters who typically don't have that. Those moments are few and far between. For me, it was like spending 90 minutes in the company of folks who frequent the store I work at. These people grate my nerves constantly and I have a hard time feeling for people like this who put themselves in bad situations. You might be able to mock them for a bit of a laugh. This is a day in the life type of film where you're spending time with two transgender prostitutes who are best friends, one is preparing to performance in her own show and the other is fresh out of jail looking for the woman she believes is cheating with her boyfriend/pimp. Yeah sounds like wonderful people but there are still human beings. They have fears. They feel betrayal just like anyone else. I did like this aspect of the movie. I warmed up to these impulsive chaotic people. But it is rough going.This was shot on Iphones and it shows. It's impressive in that it didn't make me motion sick but a lot of the scenes had a fish eye appearance to it. Everything also had an orange tint to it. That might just be the sun itself in these scenes but it worked for this movie. The performances are fine. I found the characters obnoxious. It made sitting through the movie a slog. I hope The Florida Project is different and maybe I can warm up to the characters a little faster than I did here. This movie is not for everyone. I appreciate the quick pace of the editing and some of the camera work. I also appreciated what they were trying to do here. I give this film a C."
" Who writes some of these reviews? This movie was bad.
",2018-01-12 00:00:00,2,"Some people say ""best movie."" What? It was so bad. The acting was terrible, the writing was terrible and yes it looked like a iPhone. Not in a good way.I turned it off after 20 minutes, and that was me being extremely patient. I live in that area so I know the corner very well and yes that's the crowd that hangs out there, but it was like the filmmakers didn't get it and the lengthy nonsensical dialogue was uninteresting.I was gonna give it one star which it deserves, but just for the effort of the different subject matter and in general the long hard work you put into making a film I give it two stars."
" Betrayal and friendship at their most raw
",2017-11-12 00:00:00,8,"Really liked 2012's 'Starlet', so 2015's 'Tangerine' was definitely going to be seen. Just in case anybody is wondering what my incentive was for seeing the films, it's for getting acquainted with director Sean Baker's work before seeing his recently released film 'The Florida Project'.Found myself liking 'Tangerine' even more. A few parts are still a little forced and written and resolved somewhat too neatly, but there is not much to criticise a film that is a little texturally richer and more intimate in detail than to 'Starlet'. Like with 'Starlet', the faults are fairly minor and are eclipsed by everything else that is done right. 'Tangerine' is most interesting for its unique visual style and using real life transgenders for actors, but despite how this sounds this is not a gimmick film and has much more to it than that.Visually, it won't appeal to all, some may find it amateurish. With me though, the shot entirely on three iPhones look was surprisingly naturalistic and added a high-voltage intensity and realism to a story that is often confrontational in manner. The music has some nice atmosphere too.Like with 'Starlet', 'Tangerine' really stands out in the writing, with a great balance of funny comedy, charming warmth, understated sweetness and touching drama. The story likewise, it really made me feel warm inside, it made me laugh, it surprised me, it charmed me and it moved me. There is some explicitness and some vulgarity, but it felt raw and any shock drama just added another layer to the drama. The Christmas fairy-tale feel that is at times adopted is not sugary, if anything it's got a lot of attitude which was surprising in a good way.Once again, Baker's direction is adroit and he paces everything beautifully. Would go as far to say that his direction is even better and more comfortable here than it is in 'Starlet', it's richer, more intimate and more detailed.'Tangerine's' acting is not quite as good as 'Starlet's', but it is still surprisingly very good. Especially from Mya Taylor who fully succeeds in making her character come over as a real-life person with strengths and flaws rather than a caricature or stereotype.Altogether, a very good film, very different to 'Starlet' but has many of what made that film as impressive as it was. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
" Beautifully shot, hilariously sad!
",2017-10-09 00:00:00,9,"The rough themes of drug use, prostitution, violence and poverty are presented through hilarious and oddly lovable characters and beautiful wide shots of the tangerine LA skies. I think the issues within this film may make some audience members uncomfortable. My friend with whom I watched the film with noted that it was ""quite graphic"" and on reflection it really isn't it's just that the film doesn't hide the 'dirty' side of things.In fact, it solely revolves around the dirty side of things. Yet you can't help but watch and laugh along with the portrayals of friendship and love that are uniquely expressed by each character. Great humor and warm backdrop aside, it's a touching film and I'm so very glad that I watched it."
" Unwatchable
",2017-10-08 00:00:00,4,"I'm not so concerned with ""high-concept"" in motion picture as in the execution of it. So much hype surrounded this film. Long-standing indie journalists and industry professionals urged me to see it. I tried. I realize that we're talking about hotbed issues. Well, controversy may be enough to sell a movie, but it isn't enough to make it great, or even good. The movie felt amateurish. The acting was so bad that I found it unwatchable. David Lynch is correct. Here is an example of how the motion industry has effectively destroyed itself. The emperor isn't wearing any clothes. Renaissance is needed."
" Entertaining with a touch of darkness
",2017-08-30 00:00:00,6,It's immediately clear this movie doesn't fit into conventional movie genres. The way it's shot can only be described as almost fly on the wall with a touch of voyeurism. Using iPhones to shoot this really allowed for the camera float around the scenes and it always felt like it was following the action not creating it. Despite the run and gun shooting style there is still a fluidity to the how everything is shot and it didn't resort to shaky cameras to make things seem exciting.There's isn't much to the story but it still balanced the characters well and it didn't have any boring parts. The performances are overall a bit mixed in quality. There was a bit of contrast where the 2 lead women are on their own and you can tell they're not as experienced actors as the rest of the cast. But it didn't ruin movie for me it just gave it a bit more of an amateurish feel.It's worth checking out and shooting a movie this way is a really interesting viewing experience that felt more real and similar in style to the movie 'Kids'.
" Moving and gritty while being funny
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,7,This film shocked me at how it can show how bad some people have it while still making me laugh. There are some moments that are sickening and hard to watch but are necessary to really display what the characters go through. The film starts slow and I found the characters almost annoying at the start but as the film goes on your start to see who they really are and then feel some kind of sympathy for them. There is a lot of dark humor in here not the sort of jokes everybody will find funny. Overall this is really not an easy movie to watch. This is a film all about characters so I suggest you only watch if your very open minded. This is not an action film or comedy it's a depressing drama so be ready for that.
" Another terrifically original comedy-drama from Sean Baker (""Starlet"")
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,8,"This delightful odd-ball dramedy is another interesting film made around the edges of mainstream society from Sean Baker, who also made the excellent, clever 'Starlet', about a very likable, druggy, porn actress. This film is about two transsexual prostitutes who are best friends, and their series of misadventures as they try to track down Sin-Dee's boyfriend/pimp. He has broken her heart by reportedly fooling around with a non-transsexual woman while Sin-Dee was in prison for a month on a drug rap. Shot on an iPhone, and bursting with energy, playfulness, sexuality, and just the right amount of sadness and reality, it's surprising how much fun, and how often funny the film is, while still allowing these 'outsider' characters dignity and heart. It sometimes feels a bit episodic and repetitive, and a couple of bits are humor are forced. Also, for the most part these are not actors, and while that raw, unprofessional quality can nicely add to the sense of truth, it can also occasionally hurt the comic timing, or take away from the emotion of a scene. But overall, this is a terrifically original American indie, made from the heart, and on far less than a shoestring, It gives voice and humor to leading characters who at best would be a throw away one line joke in most Hollywood films. (It also looks pretty damn good for a film shot on a phone!). Well worth seeing."
" The Real Transgender Streetwives Of LA
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,2,"...should have been the title for this film. I'm not a big fan of 'scripted reality' shows and this is basically an SR show made into a feature length film with a few added gimmicks thrown in to get attention.The film starts abruptly enough, and at this point I was thinking 'ok well judging by the reviews the film obviously has great characterisation or something' but no it just becomes a mess of bitching, swearing, walking about, ""cool"" music interludes and the protagonists being generally unpleasant to anyone and everyone they meet.Throw in the fact it's all shot on iPhone - which conveniently excuses the cast for their atrocious acting - and let's not forget the hype generated by the transgender / transsexual angle - and you've got a film which isn't going away in a hurry.It's great to see trans women - in fact anyone from an LGBT subgroup for that matter - represented on-screen by people from that actual community - but just imagine how much better it would be if they tried to actually act!I like the fact this film gives a voice and some screen time to otherwise marginalised actors and actresses - but it's done so amateurishly it's impossible to feel anything for any of the characters because they are depicted as either unlikable or just unrealistic human beings. You'll find yourself asking how some of these people made it to adulthood if this is the way they treat each other. Where's the love?As for this being a Christmas movie, if they didn't feel the need to remind the viewer that 'it's xmas eve!' every 6 mins you would be forgiven for assuming it's the middle of July.Please... discount the gimmicks and give Tangerine a miss. Maybe someone will do a film like this properly in the future, but for now just avoid this cheap and boring movie.ALTERNATIVE SUGGESTIONS: Sense8 covered some similar themes and delivered superior performances compared to this tosh - and if you really must watch scripted reality watch something like TOWIE instead... at least in that they respect each other as human beings."
" Tangerine
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,7,"I saw this film mentioned on Film 2015, and then it was one of the newest entries in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it looked and sounded like a really interesting film, especially how it was made, so I had to watch it. Basically Sin-Dee Rella (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez) is a transgender prostitute who has just been released from a 28-day prison sentence, it is Christmas Eve and she meets with her fellow transgender prostitute and friend Alexandra (Mya Taylor) in a donut shop in Hollywood. During their conversation, Alexandra accidentally reveals that Sin-Dee's boyfriend and pimp Chester (James Ransone) has been cheating on her with a woman of cisgender (their gender identity corresponds with their biological sex). Sin-Dee is angry and storms out to search the neighbourhood for Chester and the woman, while Alexandra hands out flyers for her evening musical performance, she also argues with a client who refuses to pay for business, the police break up this argument. Armenian cab driver Razmik (Karren Karagulian) is regularly looking for sex workers, he picks up a prostitute, but ejects her when discovering she is not transgender, he later meets Alexandra who gives him fellatio in a car wash, he then returns home for Christmas dinner with the family. Sin-Dee finds the woman she is looking for, Dinah (Mickey O'Hagan), at a motel brothel, she drags her around town to continue searching for Chester, Dinah continually taunts her along the way, but they stop to watch Alexandra at the venue to perform her music show, no other customers have arrived, it is a mostly empty bar. Razmik leaves his family to watch Alexandra's performance, claiming he is working, but he finds out he is too late, while he searches for Sin-Dee, Razmik's mother-in-law follows him. Sin-Dee, Alexandra and Dinah go to the donut shop, Chester arrives and a confrontation takes place, he insists Dinah means nothing to him, Razmik arrives, followed by his mother-in-law, who calls his wife, Razmik's wife arrives with their infant daughter, and the arguing gets more heated, until the donut shop owner calls the police. Razmik and his family return home, Dinah walks back to the brothel, but there is no room for her, outside the donut shop Chester tells Sin-Dee he also slept with Alexandra, upset Sin-Dee leaves and tries to pick up clients, but she gets urine thrown on her verbal abuse, in the end Sin-Dee and Alexandra go to a laundry service to clean up, and they seem to make amends. Also starring Alla Tumanian as Ashken, Luiza Nersisyan as Yeva, Arsen Grigoryan as Karo, Ian Edwards as Nash, Clu Gulager as The Cherokee and Ana Foxx as Selena. Rodriguez and Taylor are fantastic as the almost mismatched two black transgender hookers striding up and down to resolve their issues, the script is full of murky and intimate subject matter, there are the odd icky and vulgar moments, but it is also very funny, the characters constantly calling each other ""girl"" and ""bitch"" for example, and it is surprisingly charming. But what makes this film really stand out, it is obviously a low-budget venture, and it was all shot with three iPhone 5s smartphones, giving the film both depth in its observation and a reality show kind of feel, it should be mentioned also that the title relates to the colour of the Los Angeles sky at sunset, overall it is a most engaging and enjoyable comedy drama. Very good!"
