" quirky and fascinating
",2021-04-08 00:00:00,8,"I saw Jaco Van Dormael's Toto le Heros 30 years ago, thought it was brilliant, and then inexplicably never say any of Van Dormael's movies until just now, when I watched the absolutely wonderful Brand New Testament.This crazy movie features a sadistic God who created people to make them miserable and spends all his time coming up with rules to make life worse. He lives in Brussels with a cowed wife and a young, antagonistic daughter. The latter, named Ea, decides to continue her brother Jesus' good works by going to Earth and gathering a few disciples.I loved this movie from the first scenes of a naked, weirdly censored Adam wandering through a deserted, modern-day Brussels. The movie is crazily imaginative, as Ea cultivates a succession of oddballs, changing their lives in strange ways. The movie tackles intriguing philosophical questions like, how would we live life if we new the date we would die, while simultaneously hitting fantastical elements like exploring a romance between a woman and a great ape.When I read reviews I was really shocked so many people didn't care for it, or thought it was just alright, but I admit this is very different so I guess that makes sense. For me, this is exactly the kind of movie I enjoy, and between this and Toto I've realized that I must seek out everything by Dormael immediately (there's surprisingly little).Highly recommended to those who appreciate something that's funny and smart and original and out there."
" Almost there, but not quite....
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,5,"Ok, the Far Right will find fault with the humanization and characterization of God.
The Far Left will rejoice in the mockery of a deity.
As a Catholic I found the middle....The premise was there. Original and full of potential.However, the film doesn't know what it wants to be.
Is it supposed to be an art house, surreal, cinematic acid trip or is it supposed to portray existence in a different and dark light?
Unfortunately, it gets lost in the middle and doesn't score on either genre.
Just got the feeling the director was unprepared or too inexperienced for this subject matter.Just tried to do too much.However, I certainly could see a US version starring Bill Murray! Just a bit of rewrite and portray the message a little different....."
" Transhumanist garbage
",2020-10-28 00:00:00,1,"Original, but a pathetic example of more anti-god crap from the anti-god media. ""We know what would make creation better"". This is the world re-imagined by leftists."
" Good description of god :)
",2020-10-01 00:00:00,8,"If you want to make god laugh, tell him about your plans :))))"
" A Film Without Redemption
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,2,"This film is without redemption. It is based on a supersessionist caricature of the vengeful God, that quickly grows into a cynical hatred of the world. Only the sharpest of black comedies or truly absurdist humour could fix this, but the film is tonally confused, veering from the twisted (a murderer 'saved' by sex with a stranger), the tedious (apostles as hockey or baseball teams) and the trite (there's a song in everyone!).The grand finale tries to imagine a better world in which skies are full of flowers and people can walk underwater, a vision so vacuous that we almost start to feel that the evil God, now inexplicably forced to work in an Uzbek factory, can't have been so bad after all; at least His creation had gravity. By failing to engage with complexity in the world and with no imagination in the characters, the film's premise follows no direction and plays as a series of banalities. Avoid this film, for the love of God!"
" Joy filled!
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,9,"I am in such a good mood after having just watched this movie! It was exactly the kind of movie I need to see to remind me how special each ordinary life is.With gentle music, beautiful cinematography, and calm dialogue, this film creates a dreamlike atmosphere. It's got a magical quality like a fairytale.I laughed aloud several times, and I don't tend to do that much while watching movies. Along with the humor, this film also has a real poignancy. Several concepts are philosophical and have given me much to think about.If you appreciate a movie that is imaginative, creative, and pleasantly surreal, I think you will really enjoy this one as I did."
" Charming with great characters
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,8,"We came to this after watching Mr Nobody. The director brings a freshness, vivacity and kindness to his films, it's like a warm bath, fresh air and sunlight on your face. Some of the visuals are utterly lovely and others convey the darkness and mean-ness of God's twisted and bored soul. It's a shame for Uzbekistan that he dropped in...Victor's book looks fab and if they printed it, I'd buy it. Great acting from all, and some really interesting characters. We will watch this again for sheer pleasure."
" GJ
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,7,Fun movie with differrent perspective ðŸ˜¬. It is worth watching!
" What's the moral of the story here!
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,1,The story is all over the place the jokes are silly and cheap watching the movie after the first 30 minutes becomes a chore just to see how it ends and if everything presented will eventually tie up or not.
" Innovative satire with a humorous, poetic approach. It makes you smile!
",2020-01-07 00:00:00,7,"I had fun watching it.Yes, you can't take it TOO seriously (it's a satire!); the approach onto religion, god and life is refreshing and pretty amusing. I had great fun watching it, there is no boring slope in the narration and the pace is entertaining.I loved especially the poetic approach to it, narrated by the little girl, as she meets the apostles. The characters feel fairy-tale like but relatable and these encounters feel very substantial to our approach to life in general. They question human motives, emotions, dreams and purposes. It is filled with beautiful imagery and dialogue, lightweight and still with a fair amount of depth.It might leave you with a slightly different approach to life as before. If so, or if you just had a good laugh, the movie has done its deed successfully.Life is beautiful.
Enjoy it.
Amen!"
" An EXCELLENT WATCH !!
",2019-10-27 00:00:00,9,"Who wouldn't want to see God..? The Almighty who is the Creator of all of us and everything around, above and below us - including the big and small miseries that engulf us on an everyday basis. While God is generally conceived as an epitome of love, grace and all things wonderful, it is also true that most, if not all of us, on our bad days, would've cursed this very entity for a sadistic streak that piles on the pain on us, the hapless victims.This delightful movie imagines God (BenoÃ®t Poelvoorde) to be a nerdy, booze addled and perennially grumpy middle aged guy, living in Brussels, in an high rise apartment which has no doors to the outside world, with his submissive wife (Yolande Moreau) and young daughter. He terrorises his meek wife to such an extent that she hardly ever opens her mouth in his presence and shivers whenever his temper escalates which happens quite frequently. He spends most of his time behind closed doors working at his computer through which he controls the fate of everyone on earth. He finds great amusement in concocting ever new modes of misery to torment the mortals on Earth ranging from a falling toast landing on the wrong side to catastrophes which claim numerous lives.His daughter, Ea (an endearing Pili Groyne), though, is mischievous and is keen to explore the world outside. She considers her dad as a sadistic boor and hates him for shutting her out of the rest of the world and for his ruthless streak of seeking pleasure by heaping pain on hapless human beings. Egged on by her long lost elder brother JC (Jesus Christ, of course), Ea breaks out of her home. But, before leaving home, she hacks into her dad's computer system and resets the password, thereby locking him out of it. She also reveals the date of death to all the residents of the planet through a celestial SMS which sets off a series of bizarre repercussions across the globe.After escaping from home, she follows the advice of her elder brother JC and sets out to find six new apostles who would assist her in writing a brand new testament for humanity. She chooses an assorted bunch of persons to be her apostles including a lonely beauty who has lost her arm in a freak accident, a middle aged sex maniac, a corporate worker, a rich and lonely old woman and a young boy diagnosed with terminal illness along with a homeless old beggar who is her designated scribe. The rest of the movie narrates the events of Ea's encounters with this assorted bunch of individuals and creation of a brand new testament even as she is hounded by her dad who wants to regain access to his celestial computer system.Director Jaco Van Dormael has created a very imaginative and highly irreverent satire which is playful to the extent of being blasphemous. It is quintessentially a feel good feature which is laced with several laugh-out-loud moments including those involving the fate of the God, in hot pursuit of Ea, getting a taste of his own medicine which are especially hilarious. Besides the loads of fun, there is also a distinct feminist undercurrent that runs through the movie which is perfectly cast and well executed.A co-production between Belgium, France, and Luxembourg, this movie is a manifest testimonial to the levels of artistic freedom prevalent in these countries which have collaborated to produce a movie with such irreverence to contemporary religious beliefs. A movie of this nature is simply unimaginable in most parts of the world which is sinking under a surge of religious bigotry and intolerance. This movie has won many accolades at multiple film festivals across the globe and was also highly appreciated in the Bengaluru International Film Festival (BIFFES), 2016.Check out this lesser known gem and am sure that you would find yourself laughing out loud and grinning till its entire length. A word of caution though to those of you who are highly conservative and may regard any kind of pun/satire on religious beliefs as highly objectionable - If you are one, then you would do well to skip this flick."
" A comedy which still made me rethink things
",2019-10-06 00:00:00,9,"I really liked this movie, very well written, cool plot"
" God damn awful in Brussels
",2019-09-15 00:00:00,1,"Massively underdeveloped. An interesting idea, potentially, but the parts just didn't come together to produce a satisfying whole. Perhaps it simply wasn't absurd enough? (And I found it sad, rather than funny.)Why have the gods of great cinema forsaken us?"
" ""Just a Bit of Fun""
",2019-07-28 00:00:00,4,"Perhaps my take is too rigidly logical, but the absurdism often felt like an excuse to be lazy. I suspected as much in the beginning, at which point the writer clearly established ""this is just a bit of fun"" with deliberately silly, nonsensical choices - like the idea that God lives just the same as humans, like God invented washing machines and there were skyscrapers in the Garden of Eden, etc.In a sense, this silliness paralells the silliness of man creating god unimaginatively in his own image. So I thought perhaps this wasn't a portent of lazy writing but a deliberate social commentary. 'Soft' magic systems can render beautiful fiction, when the writer uses them sparingly and poetically. Leaving the viewer or reader with questions rather than simply boxing everything up in a dense technical manual of exposition is usually a wise and bold artistic choice.However, to make the poetry of 'soft' magic explicable, it should either be handled sparingly or in a very surreal manner. The first three quarters of the movie handled this rather well, but the ending - all elements of conflict resolution - were a slapdash afterthought of fanciful but uncreative wish thinking, along the lines of 'and everyone gets a pony'. Why a pony? Why not a leopluredon? It's a shame to take such potential and then wind it down with cliches. All in all, the ending was quite lazy and pedestrian, as well as deliberately outrageous, but only in that narrow, limited scope of what's politically fashionable at the moment. These facts cheapened the film and will inevitably date it.For instance, they use the vehicle of a very absurdist and silly film to endorse a trans boy as a sad and heroic character, but only did so in the sense of ""and look, we have a boy in a dress! How crazy is that?"" - but 'bringing up this issue' in context was a bit reminiscent of the time the Twilight series abruptly and haphazardly tried to tackle the topic of abortion. It felt forced and a little of out of place, like all of the sudden a clearly very silly film decided to deliver a message - easily lost amid the litany of other propositions which were clearly intended as jokes. If the discussion was 'aberations of the status quo' created by a cruel and capricious deity, it wasn't pushed far enough. In other words, it was a very carelessly executed Harry Potter level of fantasy.None of the characters were very likeable, but for Jean-Claude and Victor. I've noticed that this is a common trait of European film: making amoral characters sans heroicism. Not in the black and white, complicated HBO way in which they have extraordinary highs and lows of valour, but in the sense that people are almost all equally uninspiring but in different ways. A lot of European films seem to celebrate the sad, eclectic banality of ordinary people, and this was no exception. In this case, there was an especially loathsome glibness toward sadism, including the frivolous murder of animals - which was nothing but a cheap joke. The murderer on question goes on to be treated to a happy ending and casually 'redeemed', as though nothing he'd done was very bad & as though he just needed a new perspective.Lastly, one must wonder - why bother with ""just a bit of fun""? Why not reach for something greater? This movie embodies the notion of ""Don't let perfection get in the way of good enough"", and that slack disrespect for the audience's time is just a bit more glib than I would have preferred."
" Style Over Substance
",2019-06-21 00:00:00,3,"This is movie made and written by Van Dormael, director of the wonderful Eighth Day and Mr Nobody is utterly disappointing. Although all the ingredients were gathered to make a great film. A solid director, a great idea, great actors and an amazing cinematography. But all of this this cannot save a poorly written script were style dominates over essence.The story moves along mechanically like a day at school, everything is beautiful but telegraphed and ultimately pointless. The movie bears no essential message, the characters do not connect with the audience, worst the roles played legendary actors is cringeworthy. Poelvoorde, Damiens and Deneuve are completely wasted in this movie.It is sadly the kind of movie that makes you think that maybe some of the critics about Van Dormael were right, and that he is simply not amongst the great."
" Mockery..
",2019-02-17 00:00:00,8,"God lives in a messy apartment in Brussels and gets entertained by making our lives miserable.He is alcoholic,mischievous and abusing.The apparent concept of the film is a satire on God.
One day His daughter decides to reframe The Testament with six new apostles.The film follows a comical ,light hearted approach towards her journey of the formation of new testament.
******Spoiler*******meanwhile the girl has sent all the people in the world their date of deaths which infuriates her dad and He chases her down to earth.The story goes on as the girl interacts with her apostles and how they chose to lead their life after getting their death infos...sounds peculiar?? ...ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜…
The strength of the film lies in the story of six apostles who amuses the daughter of God with their approach to lead their lives.The film offers a vision of the metropolitan life in a different way .The film is a visual extravaganza.
Benoit Poolevorde is over the top as GOD..Pilli Gryne(The Daughter) is cute and sublime in her role and the supporting cast including Catherine Deneuve give memorable performances.The film doesn't deliver a strong message or not even tries to go deep ,rather it is a light hearted mockery of our mechanical life.The movie is pure fun with a pinch of sattire.
Anyways the movie was selected for golden globe in foreign category in 20167.2/10"
" Master piece!
",2019-02-09 00:00:00,9,I've watched it 10 times and I still think this is a masterpiece. The movie reminds us how much we hate God!
" ""He smelled of alcohol, decay, sweat, and urine, like a distillery in which the camel had died.""
",2018-10-31 00:00:00,9,"God exists. He lives in Brussels with his wife and daughter. God is a self-centered sadistic bully who, out of sheer boredom, created people to torture them. Most of his time he spends creating (Murphy's) laws by which the world will function, with the sole purpose to annoy, frustrate and harass humanity as much as possible, and the rest of the time he causes wars, accidents, and natural disasters. When his son tried to stop this terror and change the world for the better he ended up crucified. And now his ten-year-old daughter has had enough and she takes matters into her own hands. She runs away, appoints six apostles and writes ""The Brand New Testament.""Ea: How do you choose apostles?
Jesus: Pretend like you know, no one will question you.This surreal and absurdist black-humorous drama deals with eternal questions of the meaning of life, death, and love. Some accuse it of trying to impress by the quasi-philosophical depth, but I disagree with that. I would not say that this film fakes anything in any way. I have the impression that Jaco Van Dormael has come up with a good idea and simply let it grow and take its course, without restrictions and censorship.The cast is excellent, and particularly prominent are Benoit Poelvoorde, in the role of crazed God, and young and cute Pili Groyne, who carries almost the entire movie, uniting the child's innocence and naivety with the wisdom and determination of the new messiah. Directing, cinematography and music are simply magical, and although the film has some technical shortcomings, it didn't bother me at all. I would say that some scenes pay homage to other films. I think I recognized ""The Eighth Day"", which also was written and directed by Jaco Van Dormael, then Kubrick's ""The Shining"" and Darabont's ""The Shawshank Redemption"", as well as several others for which I am not so sure.This is the official Belgian submission for the 2016 Academy Awards. Competition must have been really strong when it did not pass. If this and my recommendation are not enough for you to watch it, the fact that it was created by the same man who was responsible for ""The Eighth Day"" and ""Mr. Nobody"" should prevail.8,5/10"

" Creative and bold

It makes you laught It makes you cry It makes you think about life and that is enough..."
" Wonderful, Absurdist Comedy
",2018-02-11 00:00:00,8,"Ladies, this one is for you. Some of you may have suspected it all along, but this film confirms God is a chauvinist pig (well, the clues were all there, come to think of it). Luckily - but unbeknownst to most - God also has a daughter, and she's had enough of her mean-spirited, bad-tempered Father and is about to teach Him a lesson. With the help of her brother (yes, THAT brother) and a somewhat unorthodox band of newly appointed disciples, she's determined to make her own mark on the universe. Needless to say, God's having none of it and tries to do everything in His - considerable - power to stop His rebellious daughter from undoing everything He's worked so hard for. This hilarious satire is a firework of inspired ideas and just a blast from start to finish. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves intelligent, absurdist comedy in the vein of 'Life of Brian' or 'South Park' and doesn't get easily offended. 8 stars out of 10.In case you're interested in more underrated masterpieces, here's a list with some of my favorites:imdb.com/list/ls070242495"
" Visually stunning but lacking story
",2017-11-20 00:00:00,8,"The director has a very good grasp of creating visual pleasing experiences. The imagery has a lot of creativity and imagination. It may come across as jarring or pretentious with all those ""unnecessary"" stylistic choices, but nonetheless all of them are interesting in their own right. The direction is playful and it looks very expensive and cinematic. From extreme wide shots, extreme close-ups, dutch angles, shallow focus, split diopter, lateral tracking shots, cg aided compositing, miniatures, the mundane and miraculous... you name it. Kind of like Brian de Palma but much more over the top. The playfulness seems to strive for an otherworldly and humorous feel. On the other hand it is heart-warming.Unfortunately the movie feels a little long and that is due to its structure. The plot is somewhat weak and there is no tension or ticking clock element. The division into episodes feels a little stop-and-go and that can be tiring. The overarcing story gets rather murky as a result. And there is a literal deus ex machina. In every other movie that would be bad but it fits this particular premise. Also they neglected to give god a character arc. He just gets humiliated with no redemption.In a lot of ways this movie is like Mr Nobody by the same director. Same strengths, same weaknesses.With all that said, I think this filmmaker should be making movies more frequently. Maybe hire another screenwriter but keep making movies nonstop."
" Unexpected treat
",2017-09-16 00:00:00,9,"I saw this on Amazon Prime on a slow afternoon and as a fan of religious satire I thought I'd give it a go, or at least check out the first few minutes...Two hours later I was grinning with delight.Anyone who's ever had a moment's anger at god, whether a fictional construct or a closely held belief, should absolutely love this. Many a time in my life this has been my exact vision of god. His continuous frustration and childish tantrums were brilliant and hilarious.The gender issues can't be ignored, with a little female Christ figure and the world-re-envisioning female deity making everything better with their feminine sensibilities. But this is definitely not a man- bashing movie at all, simply a god-mocking one. And not really mocking the high holy, for those who hold such things dear, but more like mocking the human vision of a petulant and insensitive god. The tongue-in-cheek bits of wisdom filling in the stories of the apostles are perfect. Just perfect. It's sophomoric in the best sense of the word, naivete and wisdom tied up in a sardonic little package.These days of multitasking sometimes make subtitles an inconvenience, but I was so wrapped up I completely forgot I was reading subtitles. I was just fully engaged."
" Good satire on religion
",2017-08-23 00:00:00,8,"Being a big fan of Benoit Poelvoorde I had to watch this movie. And even though Poelvoorde isn't really the main character of the story, while he's God, the movie is more than enjoyable to watch. It sometimes made me think about AmÃ©lie Poulain, complete different story but with the same easy-to-listen-to narrating voice. Pili Groyne is the narrating voice and also the main character, playing Ea the daughter of God. She did a really good job playing her role of unsatisfied of her father's work, daughter of God. The cast was very well chosen, from people nobody ever heard of to Catherine Deneuve. And also FranÃ§ois Damiens, the comedian everybody knows here in France and Belgium, as the man that can drive you completely nutters with his character of FranÃ§ois l'Embrouille, mostly known for his short videos on Youtube etc. The shooting itself is by moments sublime, very good altogether. Jaco Van Dormael delivered another good Belgian movie. You can only give him credits for that knowing the tight budget you have when producing a Belgian movie. This time Poelvoorde is not the usual comedian we know, in fact the movie has some funny moments, but it's not really a comedy. It's more a parody on the ridiculousness of religion. And that's for me, being a convinced atheist, only a thing that I can enjoy."
" a movie for liberals
",2017-08-15 00:00:00,3,"i like the first 20 minutes of movie.it's fun to watch the concept of sufferings of human beings and how those are relating to the sadistic tendency of god, also scenes which show people and their death time.but the scenes of Catherine Deneuve and gorilla is utter idiotic.and something at the last which tells on transsexual, gay, casual sex ...stuffs are unnecessary for this movie.the movie clearly supports the viewpoints of liberals and their trash ideas at the end all liberals give a standing ovation."
" ""To give mankind the awareness of their own death...awesome!""
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,7,"To many, this movie will seem blasphemous, but I think God has a sense of humor. After all, he appeared as a George Burns impersonator in that movie about himself back in 1977, a wonderful story actually that everyone should take a look at.I thought this picture had pretty good potential starting out, particularly with those Laws of Universal Annoyance that the script writers came up with. Like #2129, the phone will ring whenever you get in the bathtub. But then, and perhaps because this was a European picture where they take religion even less seriously than we do here, the film starts hitting on all the liberal points of view as they regard one's personal view of God and relationship with the Almighty.For one, the God (Benoit Poelvoorde) in this picture is a reprobate, swilling beer and generally making a nuisance of himself to his family and the rest of the world with those annoying laws of his. The apostles God's daughter Ea (Pili Groyne) selects are an assortment of random misfits, which include a killer, a sex maniac, a woman (Catherine Deneuve) who established a bestial relationship with a gorilla, and a ten year old boy who wants to be a girl. Yup, just the sort of role models one would seek out if attempting to save one's soul from the hell fires of damnation.The one concept the story did a fairly decent job with had to do with Ea's release of the dates God had on file for when everyone in the world was going to die. In a less than absurdist film, this idea could have really been explored without the farcical elements like that guy Kevin (Gaspard Pauwels), who apparently didn't get the download that all bets were off after Mrs. God inadvertently rebooted the computer. That everyone's life would undergo some significant change if one's death could truly be known is a given, so I would have appreciated a less cynical approach. Personally, I'd like to think I was going to live forever, and in the meantime, so far, so good."
" Rewriting the World
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,7,"'Le Tout Nouveau Testament' - also known as 'The Brand New Testament' - BenoÃ®t Poelvoorde plays God as rarely depicted on screen in this daring comedy from Belgium. Far from a compassionate deity, Poelvoorde is mischievous, mean-spirited middle aged man who spends all day in a tatty bathrobe, making humankind suffer for his own amusement. This set-up is initially hard to digest due to the slew of unanswered questions that it evokes, but fortunately Pili Groyne, cast as his daughter, soon comes in focus. The plot has Groyne sneak into her father's office and send text messages to everyone stating exactly when they will die, with some great moments in which various people react to the news; Gaspard Pauwels has a hilarious bit part as an internet blogger who repeatedly tries to kill himself to defy his designated death date. The plot also has Pili interview half a dozen would-be apostles in order to write the new testament of the title, something which is sometimes too sentimental for its own good. Then again, as her interviews are cut around scenes of Poelvoorde trying to catch up to her in the outside world, there is still quite a bit of humour to be add. Indeed, the funniest scenes have Poelvoorde undone by all the ridiculous rules he has written for the world and frequently bashed up by his own people who think he is delirious when claiming to be a deity."
" A dark fantasy comedy!!!
",2017-03-08 00:00:00,7,"God lives in an apartment in Belgium with his wife and his 10-year-old daughter Ea. God spends most of his time in ruining people's life by making weird rules. His daughter has also power and she wants to create a brand new testament. Ea sneaks inside Gods locked office and sends text messages to everyone in the world informing their scheduled dates of death. It's a film that has full of imagination and also has a dark comedy side. The concept of the movie was catchy and visually it's a wonderful film. Van Dormael does not lack the skill to pull of beautiful moments from this fantasy movie. Cinematographer, Christophe Beaucarne captures the craziness of God character superbly. Overall, I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes fantasy movies."
