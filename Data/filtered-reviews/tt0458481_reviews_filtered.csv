",2021-02-25 00:00:00,8,"Yeah , the lines maybe cheesy and out context, but isn't every films nowadays. This is many ayers and layers of action whilst more importantly moving forward with the actually story in hand. I'm pressed."
" Good film 7.7
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,8,Worth watching.. casting is not as perfect as the original but it is a darker more gritty film than the original with redeeming attributes. If this had clive owen again it would probably be rated higher than a 6.5
" Not as good as the first
",2021-02-19 00:00:00,8,"Sin city a dame to kill for is still a great movie but is not as good as the first. The cinematography, effects and action are as still as good as the first if not better. But the somewhat drawn out side plots and unrealistic ending the movie does lack a bit in the story department. But still a fun film"

" Deleted scenes.
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,6,"In a way, 'Sin City: A Dame To Kill For (2014)' is essentially more of the same, a follow-up to the visually arresting but ultimately somewhat shallow 'Sin City (2005)' that acts both as a sequel (to Nancy and Hartigan's story) and a prequel (to Dwight and Marv's stories). Only two of the stories in this piece actually make an appearance in Miller's graphic novel series; one of them never made it to print and the other only exists to add a bit of unnecessary closure to one of the first movie's tales. It very much feels like sloppy seconds, content cut from the original either for the sake of time or quality. Don't get me wrong, the individual stories are decent; it's just that they're nowhere near as good as those that appeared in the picture's predecessor. Still, the majority of this movie is enjoyable for what it is. It still spews narration so hard-boiled it could crack your teeth and revels in its pseudo noir milieu without really feeling like a proper noir piece. It's visually distinct and generally well-achieved - although its much bigger budget isn't really all that evident. The main issue with it is that it's even more surface-level than its predecessor. It's typically an enjoyable experience, but it just doesn't have the same impact. Still, it works well as a piece of light, hyper-violent entertainment. Even though most of it feels as though it doesn't really amount to much, it can be a decent amount of fun when it's underway. 6/10"
" Getting better
",2020-12-03 00:00:00,8,"This movie ages well, i've grown to like it. One reason is probably the quality of todays garbage. Downrated due to the quality and uniqueness of the first movie. One sholdn't compare but it's hard not to."

" Another great one
",2020-08-21 00:00:00,8,Love the style and the way they film in black and red like a dark comic book. Love Mickey Rourke character the best. My kind of movie
" A very dark (lol) action noir drama...
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,7,"It's really a 'superhero movie' like those DC/Marvel movies in disguise... these people have super powers, but it isn't explicitly stated. The movie was also breathed-upon by Quentin Tarantino and it totally shows... this is a very 'Quentin Tarantino-esque' movie. It's filled with action, though there's a good amount of drama and story/plot mixed in so that you don't get numb to the bombardment of constant action. Each of the characters are heavily unique yet extremely stereotypically portrayed (for good reason). Overall it's a good film and eventhough this type of movie will only appeal to a small percentage of general audiences, I would recommend that you watch it at least once if you're not certain, as it is really a pretty good movie, especially given the unique artistic choice with the dark art style."
" Doesn't have the same feel to it...
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,7,"Tricky to review this movie...after seeing part 1, I was blown away, finally a comic adaption that wasn't some cheesy fantasy trope. It felt over the top, but oozed style and was uber-cool, also thanks to the good cast.That's where some of the trouble starts...the cast...one could argue it isn't the directors fault some of them died. But from what I read, it is Angelina Jolie's...I read they kept delaying filming for her and after years and years, she finally would have been available, but lost interest!
Seeing how they have waited for her, they should have waited for Devon Aoki. The new Miho seems strange (clearly taller, etc). The new Manute did a decent job, Dennis Haysbert didn't seem that different from M.C. Duncan.Jessica Alba also has aged(obviously). Again, we go back to the issue of how late this sequel came out. I think it would have been a lot better if it had come out 2-3 years after the first, but almost 10? It's a bit like the Matrix movie that also suffered from the fact that many movies had copied their style, making it less unique when the new parts came out.On the plus side, we did get to know a bit about the back stories of some of the characters, although people might be a bit confused with the different time lines.
What the story of Johnny was good for though, I'm not quite sure of (although the actor did a good job).All in all, it isn't a terrible movie. It just lacks that special something part 1 had."
" Solid Sequel
",2020-05-24 00:00:00,8,Keeps the feel of the original and is entertaining for sure. Hope they do another one.
" The narrative lacks rhytim, but it's always great to walk the streets of Sin City and not know what to expect around every corner
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,7,"Nine years after visually reinventing and presenting a new form of filming, directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller are reunited to adapt the graphic novel 'A Dame to Kill For' and also bringing elements of 'Just Another Saturday Night', a tale taken from Booze, Broads, & Bullets, sixth volume in the comic book series. Two stories are unpublished: 'The Long Bad Night' and 'Nancy's Last Dance'. Most of the cast returned to this sequence. Josh Brolin takes on the role of Dwight in Sin City 2, originally played by Clive Owen and Ava Lord, the title's Dame to Kill For - a role originally thought for Angelina Jolie - was played by Eva Green.After the death of John Hartigan (Bruce Willis), Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba) thinks only of revenge. She spends her nights dancing in the same bar, but now in the company of a bottle of drink, while taking courage to face the powerful Senator Roark (Powers Boothe). At the same time, Dwight (Josh Brolin) tries to help the enigmatic Ava (Eva Green) only to find himself betrayed once again by this fatal lady. Virtually destroyed, he will seek the help of Gail (Rosario Dawson) and his gang to face the beloved, while Nancy will have the support of Marv (Mickey Rourke).Just as it was in the first film, this new journey through Sin City maintains the structure adopted in the comics and is composed of small stories that are told in parallel and without worrying about chronology - that is why Marv (Mickey Rourke) is there. return. The script seeks to divide the story again into three main plots, trying to maintain continuity with the events of the previous film. The big problem with this sequence is that the directors create an evident problem of rhythm, putting the climax practically in the middle of the work. The main narrative arc, which gives the film its name, is resolved quickly, when it could have been fragmented and interspersed with the other stories. The end result sounds like a great collection that does not necessarily follow a line of reasoning.The short story that gives title to the film, 'The Dame to Kill For' is one of them and shows Dwight McCarthy who tries to forget his violent past, working as a private detective and leading a sober life. After saving the life of con artist Sally (Juno Temple) from being killed by businessman Joey (Ray Liotta), he receives a call from ex-lover Ava Lord, who had abandoned him four years earlier to be with a wealthy tycoon, Damian Lord (Marton Csokas). Ava Lord is a woman who, when she touches a man's heart, becomes her greatest desire. A predator that usually destroys lives, sometimes for power, sometimes for profit and sometimes for sport. Ava Lord knows this and uses her sex appeal to get everything she wants from men.The directors and the beautiful Eva Green manage to impress the scenes with sensuality, a factor amplified by the plans in which we see her portrayed as a goddess surrounded by a whole mystical atmosphere. But there will certainly be a lot of people in the cinema who will see just one more macho movie there, wanting to boycott the work, after all, nowadays if any material produced does not fit the politically correct, that is, a censorship endorsed by the majority of the artistic class worldwide, it is doomed to fail, at least by critics. This segment is, without a doubt, the most involving plot of the work and manages to keep us immersed and curious waiting for its conclusion. It is interesting the mystery that was built at the beginning, in which we did not know whether Ava was telling the truth or not. Ava's nature is built slowly by the work and is revealed to be harmful with the passing of minutes. The controlled use of color is present in the eyes and lips of the seductress. Afterwards, the viewer is anxious for Dwight's revenge with the help of Gail (Rosario Dawson) and the Old Town prostitutes. We see a plethora of knives piercing brains, swords severing heads and a lot of digital blood in the best 'Sin City' style.The segment 'The Long Bad Night' is one of the unpublished stories written by Miller especially for the film and that brings Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a mysterious young man who decides to show his poker talent at a table full of influential and dangerous people . In this plot we learn that Johnny has a personal difference with Senator Roark (Powers Boothe). This plot proves to be very interesting, but its outcome leaves something to be desired, making us wonder why Miller simply does not use the original material, instead of creating this new arc that starts well, but fails for repetition in its closure.'Nancy's Last Dance' shows Nancy Callahan suffering from deep depression over the death of John Hartigan, four years earlier. She is obsessed with getting revenge on Senator Roark, until with Marv's help, she invades the senator's house to kill him and to realize her revenge. Nancy's bow is interesting and is what closes the film, while still being interesting, even if predictable. Chosen to defend a plot of bitterness and revenge, all Jessica Alba can do is to force a face of suffering while babbling her dialogues. Still, we have excellent scenes in the mansion invasion and even in the final confrontation with Senator Roark.Time was one of the great enemies of The Dame to Kill For. The sequel happened too late to accompany the commotion generated by the first film, and too soon we tried to use nostalgia to its advantage. In addition, Rank Miller's script is simply unable to fill all the stories with enough content. They are fast, empty and pale before the central plot. 'Sin City, A Dame to Kill For brings us everything we love about the first one as fun dialogues, full of catch phrases, neo-noir mixed with graphic violence. Everything follows the same pattern. It is more of the same, with the difference that in this case the narrative lacks rhythm, as previously said, and the three stories are connected in some way, but they seem to be stories played at random many times. There are also no memorable and shocking scenes as in the first, perhaps due to the public being more accustomed to this type of violence in other productions in recent years.Obviously the technical part is once again impeccable, as well as the direction, but it no longer brings innovations. It is certainly a story that will please fans of comics, since again it is an almost literal transposition of the dialogues of comics to the cinema and fulfills its role of amusement. However, for the vast majority of the audience, those behind a consistent plot, characters with whom it is possible to root and get involved, the conclusion is somewhat frustrating. Either way, it's always great to walk the streets of Sin City and not know what to expect around every corner."
" Doesn't hang together well but has great moments
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,5,"Partly prequel aswell as sequel, there are two stories here that are supremely better than the main story. Sadly, A Dame To Kill For starring Eva Green as the seductive Ava and Josh Brolin taking over the role of Dwight from Clive Owen, takes up the majority of the film's duration and it is the weakest one. Green and Brolin are great as always but don't quite manage to lift it into something exciting and despite all its visual flair, it feels more superficial than involving. What makes it more frustrating is that the mini stories surrounding it are much more interesting. A Long Hard Night starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Johnny, a gambling man who enters into a deadly poker game with the powerful senator Roark (Powers Boothe) is a really cool segment split into two; Boothe really stretches his role into the evil man that Roark really is with devastating effect and Gordon-Levitt is superb with great supporting roles from Julia Garner and Christopher Lloyd (keep your eye out for a cool Lady Gaga cameo too!) Nancy's Last Dance is also an engaging plot with the emotional core of the film being held by Jessica Alba reprising her role fantastically. She is the star of the show I think and really brings the character to a whole new level. Plus she looks amazing in her new revenge look! Mickey Rourke returning as Marv is also a delight and it's great to see him delve deeper into violent depravity against enemies while also holding incredible loyalty for his friends. There's a shiny gem here thanks to these two segments unfortunately buried quite a bit by the main titular story which lets the side down"
" Good but not as good as the first one
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,7,"Visually is more of the same and that's good because Sin City visuals are amazing. When it comes to the story itself I personally didn't enjoyed it as much as the first movie especially that with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, that one seemed really pointless. The main story and the one that gives this movie his name was acceptable and the last story gave closure about a previous story. It lacks the brilliant narration of the characters thoughts that the first one had, this still has it but in a minor quantity and without the poetry that the first one had that should be also due to the change of writers because the overall writing in this one felt worst. The action scenes were good but again not as enjoyable as in the first movie and not as violent too. Not a bad movie by any means but when you have that first masterfully done Sin City to compare this doesn't feel as god as it could."
" Great Sequel
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,7,"Not as good as the first part, but still a masterpiece!"
" Poor Script and Story for a Great Potential Series {criti-cally reviews}
",2020-03-14 00:00:00,6,"Sin City has always been one of my favourite movies. The first part (in 20050 was absolutely a stunner and had literally blown my mind away with it's storyline, and of course the amazing film-noir-cartoon style visual effects. This was the series, that had me literally searching stores for the Sin City comics, and I even actually own some! This was the first title that let me venture into the world of hardcore Graphic Novels, especially for adults. So of course, when the second part had come out I was ecstatic, but unfortunately, couldn't watch it at the time. I finally got around to seeing it over Netflix. With such a big history around this series for me personally, of course my expectations were very high with this second title.My expectation was not met. The movie didn't quite live up to it's mark for me, and was disappointing to say the least. The visuals and acting was amazing, as always. The same effects as the first part were used, and it was a great re-living of the first movie. So no complaints there!
My problem was with the overall plot and the storyline. As well as the dialogues. Could have been much much better. The first part was very interesting in this field at least.
Like the pervious part, the storyline lis compiled of several plots that are liked to the main plot some way or the other."

" Very good!
",2020-02-20 00:00:00,9,"I loved the original and had to start reading the comic books to get more. And I don't read comics. This movie fits in perfectly with the first, has the same feel and same style. Marv is included a lot which is great. The whole movie is kinda structured more than the first, which was cool.I don't see where the hate comes from. I mean it's not as good as the first but only by a little. I think the problem is that the last third is the worst part of it. In the first movie the worst part was in the middle so we end on a high note. Now when I say worst part I don't mean bad, I just mean weakest part. So when this movie is over you're kinda left with a bad taste in your mouth. Which isn't fair because everything before the last twenty minutes was so good."
" One Of My Fave Comic Book Movies
",2020-02-16 00:00:00,10,"Robert Rodriguez already proved he was right person for the job when it came to adapting Frank Miller's Sin City Comics with the first film, and this one is equally as good IMHO, if not better.
The visuals are on point, the cast does a great job, and as an adaptation this is pretty flawless.
The fact that viewers get a chance to see a never published Sin City story in this one was a real treat for someone like me who read and enjoyed all the Sin City comics. This is a great comic book movie IMHO and is highly recommended.10 out of 10!"
" sin city 2
",2019-11-10 00:00:00,6,Not as good as first but it is at least watchable follow up mixed with prequel staff that is confusing sometimes for some but for me it was good enough and i didint regret watching it
" Only one reason to watch:
",2019-10-08 00:00:00,7,All the stars are for the insanely gorgeous Eva Green. Cut out all the parts that don't feature her and it's a 10. Could watch her for hours.
" It could have been better, it could also have been worse
",2019-09-20 00:00:00,7,"Sin City was a real bombshell and the most masterful demonstration of how to adapt a comic or graphic novel.The film was almost perfect, a setting and aesthetic worthy of the best Black Cinema, Tarantinian narrative scheme, fascinating characters with intelligent dialogues, spectacular action sequences ..... I don't know if I exaggerate, but I consider it a Masterpiece and a true Cinema achievement.Here we have, then, the second part, and I think something has seriously failed.In itself, it is not a bad movie, but since it began, with the story of Joseph Levitt, which was the best and most interesting, and Levitt is immense and demonstrating a talent that does nothing but take hold, history is losing Some gas as it progresses. But for some reason that the story of Josh Brolin begins, something gets screwed and begins to lose its good progress from the beginning.It is still Sin City, okay, but for some reason the intensity and overwhelming force of the stories and scenes from the previous film are halved in this one. They do not produce so many emotions but in some sections it becomes a bit heavy, not boring, but the rhythm is weak and that kills the tension and the good rhythm.And above the action scenes are quite weak, for example the confrontation between Marv and the gigantic black Bodyguard, I expected a beastly melee, but everything stays in a couple of thrusts, two or three strokes, and Marv tearing the eye as if it were a plastic Barbie. This was the huge gorilla that was not Human? What a tease is that?Of all the characters that appear in this new sequel, only the aforementioned Levitt, the colossal Marv and Eva Green have been interesting. Josh Brolin has been very weak, Ray Liotta is almost not seen, Bruce Willis is a couple of Flashbacks and the rest is not much to highlight, there is no time.This time the movie is too short and there is no room to develop the rest of the characters, some are back there, but they don't say much, or tell stories with more force than those offered here.In a nutshell, this sequel is OK, it is GOOD, but it does not reach the HEIGHT even from the first, and that is something very serious. If it does not match or exceed the previous one, will it make sense to make a third?Highlight the scene of Levitt being treated by a half-crazy doctor embodied by the legendary Cristopher Lloyd. Just for that scene it was worth it.Thank you."
" Keep the good memories of the first movie and avoid this one
",2019-08-10 00:00:00,6,"First one was original, well-directed, and more connectable as an audience.On the contrary, this one is pretty generic, okayish directed, and I didn't give a rat's ass for anyone in the movie.Like 300 and its sequel, this one lost the surprise factor (the visual effect) and wasn't able to compensate that from story-telling. I hardly cared for anyone. As a neo-noir, this was quite boring. The only time I was excited, either when Gordon Levitt or Eva Green was on screen.Rating: 4
Meaning: Bad but watchable"
" Good: 7.0
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,7,"In this film's defense, despite being a sequel made a full nine years after the original, and even despite doing absolutely nothing new, it still feels somewhat fresh. There really isn't much else like Sin City, but that also means that there's only one film to compare it to, and this one is worse. For starters, it just isn't paced as well. Unlike the 2005 original, A Dame to Kill For switches between action and dialogue rather erratically, mitigating much of the narrative impact the first film had. And although much was made of the fact that two of the subplots were created exclusively for this movie, they don't gel at all with the comic-based ones, leading the first one to feel inconsequential and the second tacked-on. The acting and visuals are commendable, and the atmosphere is undeniable, but that's not enough to wholly redeem this somewhat disappointing sequel. It's not bad by any means, but I was expecting a whole lot more."
" I gave the original 10, now we're on 8...
",2019-07-12 00:00:00,8,"While I won't bash the movie like everyone else does, I can't help but notice that the sequel feels a lot weaker than the original. The original really felt like the comic was turned into a movie. Here it feels like the movie was turned into a comic. It isn't bad. People who say this is bad are actually critiquing Miller on which comic the story is based. Rodriguez only did the directing here. What happens is lack of style. It's still there, but only in little remains. Rodriguez acts like he is making another Machete, just with no humor. Violence is here, and boy does he not shy away from showing Eva Green naked. But, as a result, movie feels like any other movie, just with that comic aesthetic. It's still cool, and I would watch whatever is made in this style. But that's me. I get why people hate it. I think that lack of Quentin Tarantino as a guest director is really felt hard and probably his work at the first movie made it what it is. But I myself, who am on a holy mission to watch all bad, trash and exploitation movies am not, in this situation, concerned about the matters others are. Did I enjoy the movie? Yes I did! Do I recommend it? Mehhh... Not, really?! Look, if you liked the first one, watch it for fun, just don't expect the same quality. 8/10 from me!"
" my notes
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,6,"I don't think i will watch this again. I had very positive things to say about this movie in my original review. i scrapped it and dropped it from a 7 to a 6. There is still a lot of good here. But... I don't know how to explain it. i watched these movies one day apart, and i could tell within the first 30 seconds of the movie that it wasn't as good. didn't feel as right or natural. and there aren't too many memorable parts. i want to quote another reviewer that said it very well. see below (3 viewings, 2/8/2020)utgard14:
Sin City was one of my favorite movies of the 2000s. A fun, creative film noir cartoon with unique visuals and a style all its own. The first problem you run into with this sequel is that it offers nothing new. It's a stylistic retread of the first movie, only less impressive. The visuals copy the first movie but somehow seem cheaper. The makeup effects aren't as good either, with Marv's jaw easily twice the size of the last movie. The action is weaker, with no memorable sequences and a final showdown that is derivative of the first movie. The other big problem is that the writing is very poor this time and the stories don't flow well together."

" Sin City 2: A Dame To Kill For Review
",2019-03-25 00:00:00,9,"It was another dark night in Basin City when lovers Dwight and Ava Lord were reunited. But in Sin City, a reunion is never good news. And Ava has plans for Dwight.
Back in 2005, Robert Rodriguez and graphic novel creator Frank Miller collaborated to bring Miller's noir-heavy tales of Sin City to the big screen. Despite the success of that film, it has taken them nearly a decade to wrangle the budget and cast together for a second shot. This time around, the pair have cherry-picked elements from the second, eponymous story in the Sin City series and a short yarn from the sixth book combined with two original narratives - The Fat Loss and The Long Bad Night - that the author created for the film. Rodriguez, meanwhile, is again on jack-of-all-trades duty, acting as co-director, cinematographer, editor and writing some of the score. Given his predilection for cooking, he probably whipped up a few on-set meals to boot.A Dame To Kill For keeps to the template set out by the first film, and even pushes the comic visuals a step further now that audiences have accepted what the directors were able to do last time. So we return to a torn-from-the-pages monochrome city of dingy shadows, driving digital rain, and the occasional splash of colour for effect. In fact, it's a neat shot of computer-generated Mickey Spillane as before, but this time with an added femme-fatale count.Eva Green makes for a viper of a character in Ava Lord, able to switch her behaviour according to the poor sap she's trying to lure, and the actress is clearly relishing the chance to play such a conniving con artist who wraps men around her little finger and disposes of them when they're no longer useful.
Josh Brolin, taking over from Clive Owen for an earlier visit to Dwight McCarthy's tough existence, gives weary life to a man the world - and lots of people in it - just keeps wanting to beat up. Joseph Gordon-Levitt takes even more punishment as Johnny, the cocksure gambler on a mission to do more than win at poker, yet who ends up losing big. Despite being a completely original tale, Johnny feels like a natural addition to the Sin City canon, a man ready for this tough town to chew up and spit out.
The veterans, meanwhile, are still on good form: Marv fits Mickey Rourke like a glove, and he's just as dark and dangerous as ever, whether he's punishing frat boys for killing tramps or helping Dwight with a mission of his own. Jessica Alba's Nancy adds a few shades from the woman we met before - she's now a damaged, gun-toting version of herself, scarred and sadistic, channelling her fury through her dancing and building up the guts to slaughter the powerful, dreadful Senator Roark (Powers Boothe, back on smug, cigar-chewing form).Of course, hewing so closely to the feel of the original means that its inherent problems still exist: even Ava Lord's slinky power and the weapon-hefting ladies of Old Town (led once more by Rosario Dawson's Gail) can't banish the idea that women get treated terribly in this world, and the men don't come out looking much better. The stylish noir treatment lends a surreal aspect that helps mitigate a lot of that, but the issues remain. Some of the dialogue slides from hard-boiled noir narration to sounding like the feverish dream of a teenager working himself into a Chandler-fuelled frenzy, and not all of the performances fit as well as you might expect.
Yet Rodriguez and Miller have pulled off a sequel that feels truly of a piece with the original, exploring and expanding the world of Sin City and delivering a heady brew of noir, danger and style that will either make you wish you could visit or glad you don't live within a thousand miles of anywhere like it.
A Dame To Kill For shares some of the downsides of the first, particularly dubious female characterisation. But this retains the gritty, gruelling vice-grip on graphic-novel noir that made Sin City so enjoyable."
" Not as groundbreaking as the original, but still solid
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,8,"Taking nine years to follow up the groundbreaking original proved to be a death knell at the box office, which is truly a shame because this film deserved so much more attention than it garnered. Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller return to bring to life the immensely popular title story, as well as ""Just Another Saturday Night"" as well as introducing two brand new tales.The film was criticized for lacking the freshness of the first movie, but to claim that is to ignore the new stylistic tricks and how the directors play with audience expectations within the context of the signature style of both the book and film. Eva Green owns the screen whenever she appears, which is testament to her perfect performance in the title role, as every actor, both new and returning, commit totally to their parts. With one big story and three more personal tales, the bigness of the original may understandably be absent, but the strength of the stories, the strength of the acting, the strength of the direction is in no way minimized by the scale."
" More of the same, for better and for worse
",2019-01-31 00:00:00,7,"The living, breathing comic book style of ""Sin City 2"" is not as groundbreaking as it was back in 2005, but it's still dazzling and unique. The stories are simplistic and shallow (like they were in the first film, let's not pretend any different here), the characters deliberately stereotypical, but the film delivers the (ultraviolent) goods and has plenty of inventive moments and an impressive cast. *** out of 4."
" Disappointing Sequel
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,3,It's been quite a while since I last saw the first Sin City movie but I remember really enjoying it. It felt really original and unique and as a comic book fan I was happy with it. I can't really explain why it has taken me so long to watch this follow up movie but after ages I gave it a try. I honestly found it all a bit of a mess. It was so hectic. At times I felt bored. Very few characters I cared for. Characters I remembered enjoying watching in the first movie I did not really give a damn about in this movie. The only character I enjoyed was Josh Brolins but his story was ridiculous. In fact many of the stories were just nonsense. I am no prude but I found much of the Eva Green's nudity so unnecessary. She is an amazing actress and I just felt it wasn't needed to the extent we saw. All the visuals were ok but not as good or I should say as cool as the original. I say cool as that was what the original Sin City was whereas this sequel just seemed like it was trying to hard. Disappointing
" Good Fun
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,8,"I saw the original Sin City quite a while back and honestly can't remember many of the characters - just that I enjoyed it.
Similarly, this was a fun ride. However, if I were Jessica Alba I would probably have lobbied for reshoots or for it not to be released at all. She is *completely* acted off the screen by Eva Green and even Juno Temple (who gets minimal airtime) leaves a much more lasting impression.
Accordingly, the ""climactic"" final segment feels like a poor and underwhelming ending relative to what had gone before - where most of the acting was fine and the tone of a ""noir for the 21st century"" was admirably maintained.
Definitely worth a look if you enjoyed the first one."
" Notmal movie
",2018-10-31 00:00:00,7,This is not a nice movie. Just normal. Woman deceived a guy many times. He know she deceives but he can't control himself because he loves her. Nothing can be changed on love.
" THE GODDESS MAKES SLAVES OF ALL OF US
",2018-09-05 00:00:00,8,"This film centers on the relationship of private detective Dwight (Josh Brolin) and that of his former girlfriend Ava (Eva Green) who plays him. Then about 20 minutes from the end, an undeveloped subplot involving Senator Roark (Powers Boothe) and his illegitimate son (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) finishes off the picture.This film has all the neat graphics as the original. The plot is not as confused as the first one which was a weave of subplots and flashbacks. If you haven't seen the first film, I would not recommend watching this one as the end will be very confusing. Clearly this production is not nearly as good as the first one, but they did a nice job bringing back the cast, I just wish they had a better story line.Eva Green stars as our femme fatale as Scarlett Johansson has filled her quota for nude scenes this year. Jessica Alba becomes a major player only in the last part of the film. Due to the graphic novel style, no one looks like they aged. and Nancy (Alba) still looks like a kitten on stage. The film still incorporates the colorful/metaphorical monologue.""Liquid darkness fills us both.""
""Death is just like life in Sin City.""
""The Goddess make slaves of us.""Worth watching if you have seen the first one. Don't expect the complexity.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Eva Green, Juno Temple)"
" If you liked the first one. this is for you also.
",2018-09-04 00:00:00,7,"The first movie was something of a unique classic and this one is although not as good, its not as bad as the critics are pointing out. Majority of the cast from the first movie were there despite the unfortunate deaths of Michael Clarke Duncan who was replaced by Dennis Haysbert and Brittany Murphy. Being as Clive Owen was one of the stand outs from the first movie, being replaced by Josh Brolin for the character Dwight had a detrimental effect on my viewing of this one. Clive Owen stated conflicting scheduling as his reason for not being in Sin City 2. The other change was Devon Aoki who was pregnant and was replaced by Jamie Cheung who didnt have the same impact. All in all though despite the changes it was a fun movie. Loved Eva Green and Rosario Dawson in particular. Great movie."
" Good 2nd movie
",2018-08-14 00:00:00,6,This movie didn't let down. The 1st was good and this one was just as equal.
" Great, but still a copy
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,8,"""A Dame to Kill For"" is in every way a copy of ""Sin City"", just telling a different story. The same team is ""behind the camera"", and in front of it part of the actors from the first movie reprise their roles, enriched with some other big names, such as Joseph Gordon-Levitt, magnificent Eva Green, Ray Liotta i Christopher Meloni. The only disappointment is recasting of Dwight, although Josh Brolin did a very good job. I consider ""Sin City"" one of the greatest movies of all time, so it could be assumed that this is a ten too. But it doesn't work like that. A perfect ten, in addition to quality in all aspects, must have something of its own, characteristic, something that stands out from the mass, which will be remembered and that will resist tooth of time. This movie, however good, is a copy of the first one that does not bring anything new and, even if it does not fall into oblivion, it will be remembered as a copy. Extremely good, maybe even as good as the original, but still a copy. I think its bad ratings are not based on objective quality, but on the disappointment of the spectators who expected to be blown away in the way that the first film did. But the same people who was amazed by ""Sin City"" in 2005 can hardly be amazed ten years later by exactly the same things. If they came out in reverse order it is possible that the ratings would be reversed too. Personally, I think that the film is top-notch in every way, but the effect of ""already seen"" affects me too, so I have to distance it from the original.8,5/10"
" Another fun, gritty, violence-fuelled ride through Sin City
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"'Sin City: A Dame To Kill For' is a quality sequel to an exceptional, unique film. I gave 'Sin City' 4.5 stars and this film doesn't quite match the first film's graphic violence or pure originality. Having said that, however, there's still plenty to love about 'Sin City 2' - it's genuinely funny in parts, has the same great comic book-feel, with fantastic use of black & white, shadows and splashes of vivid colour to highlight certain aspects of a scene. The use of animation blends superbly with the actual actors and the score keeps everything moving.Returning from the first 'Sin City' film are Marv (Rourke), Nancy (Alba), Roark (Boothe), Gail (Dawson), Dwight (now Brolin, not Owen), Miho (now Chung, not Aoki), Manute (now Haysbert, not Clarke Duncan, due to obvious reasons) and Hartigan (Willis, in flashbacks). The characters don't get confusing or overwhelming, since the film's basically split into three inter-connected parts. There's Johnny (Gordon-Levitt) and his poker battles with the corrupt Senator Roark, then Ava (Green, who spends 50% of her screen-time naked - not a bad thing!) & Dwight's ill-fated romance, and finally Marv & Nancy's decision to do something about Roark. Almost each of the three parts has overlap with 3-5 characters from the other parts, all handled very well. There's also plenty of great supporting cast - Meloni, Piven, Lloyd, Liotta, Temple.I really enjoy how it looks like a comic book, but it could easily be the back streets of New York, Chicago or Los Angeles. There's some nice tie-ins back to the first film, still plenty of guns, swords and fighting - Marv/Rourke does remind me of Hellboy/Perlman a lot! - all done quickly (less than 100min) and stylishly."
" +++ The Feeling of the Comic Book with a Small Plus ++++
",2017-11-28 00:00:00,9,"+++ The Feeling of the Comic Book with a Small Plus ++++ ------- ------- ------- ------- Capturing again that sensation from the comic maybe caused by those black and white scenes with some areas in color that make a feeling of cold and shivers travel all the way up our spine, this second part of Frank Miller's Sin City is completely worth-watching.Being based primarily in Frank Miller's second story from the SIN CITY series, it was actually the one that I thought that they'd have taken to the big screen when they made their first movie as it was by far my favorite and the one that had a more defined central argument.Continuing with all the good stuff from the first movie, it uses a lot of characters and elements we already knew, we had a conclusion for the tormented tale of Nancy Callahan portrayed by Jessica Alba and John Hartigan (now a ghost), performed by Bruce Willis which was a very logical conclusion to their story. But along all the good elements in the film, foremost I think that Eva Green's AVA gives us an interesting turn to the plot; unlike her comic book counterpart, this AVA never really seems a defenseless damsel in distress which means that most men falling for her can't be really considered victims, as they fell actually wanting to fall; they could have believed anything she said or even still make her will in the case they didn't. That makes her character a bit more powerful and some of the other characters, much less innocent.As I said I thought that this was going to be the story that they were going to use in the first SIN CITY movie and now that they have finally taken it to the screen, IMO it was completely worth it.I don't understand fully why it was not as successful as the first part. My guess is that it was not so surprising for a lot of people because most of the characters weren't new and the interesting visual format wasn't new either, nevertheless I think that both movies are more or less equally good, even when I must admit I prefer this second one by a bit.Thanks for reading.IMDb Review written by David del Real.November 2017."
" A shallow tale exposed.
",2017-08-25 00:00:00,6,"Intense torment is part of the makeup of the denizens of Sin City, where people do bad things even if it was their intent to do good. And regardless of their intentions, torment is their due. The city corrupts and twists morals yet despite this corruption sometimes good comes from bad. This formula made the first movie work but the magic falters in this one because at heart the characters and story are incredible shallow. But this was all hidden from sight by the sheer intensity of its telling. As a concept, supported by some enigmatic filming, fitting dialogue and characters whose plight you care about(mostly John Hartigan and Nancy Callahan) the first movie was great. It was intense.But in this movie, despite everything, it is the characters that are lacking. The only really interesting person is Ava Lord played by Eva Green and,to a lesser degree, Senator Roark, played by Powers Boothe. The others, even Dwight McCarthy, Nancy Callahan and Gail, seem bland and the latter turned in an extra.Obviously the casting has suffered at some points. It demonstrates once more how the right actors can change a movie. Clive Owen has been replaced by Jos Brolin as Dwight McCharty, which made for a somewhat indifferent feel. Aiko is replaced by Chung as Miho which definitely changed her character dramatically. Aiko made Miho just look terrifying dangerous while Chung makes her look cute. The final nail in the coffin is that the movie lacks intensity. What looked awesome in the first looks bland in the second and once you are no longer charmed away from the movie by its intense telling the shallow depth of its story and characters are exposed and thus turns it the lesser movie.Still, this isn't a bad movie. It can be worse and it certainly is still entertaining even if it was only for watching Eva Green, Powers Boothe and Mickey Rourke."
" graphic novel on screen
",2017-08-11 00:00:00,8,"There are films based on graphic novels (comics books) heroes and action stories and the genre is flourishing making happy studios and fans of all ages. And there are the 'Sin City' films which are graphic novels on screens. 'Sin City: A Dame to Kill For' directed by Frank Miller (who also created the books that inspired them) and Robert Rodriguez is only the second in this genre. I liked it. I will try to explain the reasons and the difference.The first thing to notice with 'Sin City 2' (as for the first one almost one decade earlier) is that it does not pretend to be anything else that it is. It is a comics story which is directly designed for the big screen rather than for the paper support of the graphic novels. The story (there are actually three almost independent story threads) is simple and relies mostly on action. No psychological or character development is to be expected from its heroes, they are from the first time they appear on screen until the moment they die or the end of the movie (what comes first) 'The Drunken Righteous', 'The Dangerous Vamp', 'The Corrupt Senator','The Nice Face Gambler', etc. The actors either wear masks (Mickey Rourke) or they are their own masks (Jessica Alba, Bruce Willis, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Josh Brolin, Powers Boothe, Ray Liotta). Most of them create their own characters as graphical novel heroes. The only one who holds some mystery and hides - at least for some time - her real intentions is the character played by Eva Green. All seem to enjoy themselves greatly to be in the film.All this concept is supported by a superb cinematographic solution which places the actors on sets that seem to be drawn in comics style and uses mostly black-and-white with touches of selected colors as in the mid 20th century comics books combined with the cinema masterpieces of 'film noir' from the same period. The execution is perfect, and the action scenes not only support the stories but also create moments of aesthetic wonder and fit perfectly in the atmosphere. The concept and the execution make of 'Sin City: A Dame to Kill For' a rare combination of good entertainment and stylish cinema."
" Sin City: A Dame to Kill For (2014)
",2017-05-18 00:00:00,7,"Of course I was going to seize the opportunity to use this amazing poster of the gorgeous Eva Green for this post. I re-watched the first Sin City the other day and recalled how much I enjoyed the style and the different stories and characters portrayed in it. The sequel was a long time coming but when I initially saw it I thought it was rather disappointing and far off the standard of the first. I still kind of feel that way but hey I might as well share why this time.The sequel is shared in the same format as the first with a few stories, some take place prior to the events of the corresponding segments in the first film, others afterwards. There are character changes (most notably a switch of Josh Brolin for Clive Owen) but many from the first film return. There are also a few steamy addition like Jun Temple and the very SEXY Eva Green. I wasn't sure I wanted a sequel because like most sequels, I thought it would pale in comparison to the original. This is the case with this film.Some of the segments are entertaining. Others not so much. For all the style and blood and violence this film offers, the stories can't help but feel dull. The A Dane to Kill For segment was fabulous looking and so well performed by the sultry Eva Green, but the rest itself was overlong and dreary. The final segment and showdown between Nancy Callahan and Roark was also disappointing. The film and segments definitely could have used more thought out writing.The film is style stylistically excellent. Its a joy to look at on screen and still has an excellent comic book neo-noir feel to it. The bloody violence is still on point. The main pitfall is not being able to avoid to cap on the stories and brilliance in the stories of the first film. It wasn't without effort, but Robert Rodriguez has still yet to make a good sequel (at least in my honest opinion). Its still a decent to good film but it could have been much better.7/10"
" 3D version adds so much to this film
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,8,"I'm not an avid 3D lover. Many give me a headache. But some are just so much better and enhance the movie. This is one. While I definitely love the first and it will be a classic, iconic, cult hit for generations to come this was a great sequel that does not deserve some of the hateful remarks, yet everyone is entitled to their opinion. The simplest of the 3D is what blew me away. Take note of the smoky rooms and the falling snow. It truly looks as if it is all around you. It wasn't the usual bullet or weapon flying at your face routine. It was those subtle touches that added the quality. I for one enjoyed the story line. I watched the movies back to back and that added even more to the viewing experience. Don't let the haters sway you away from this. Check it out yourself. Preferably in 3D."
" Well, I enjoyed it
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,8,"The original ""Sin City"" movie is currently ranked as one of the best movies of all time on this website. While I saw it and didn't find it to be great, I had no problem with it. I actually enjoyed this one. I admit that its main problem is how confusing it is with the first movie. It actually has scenes that take place both before and after the original movie, so it's kind of like a ""The Godfather Part II"" thing. While that film obviously did it better, I really did like this. It helps that there are so many wonderful actors in this. I'm kind of a sucker for stuff with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Christopher Lloyd. Wait, they were in ""Angels In The Outfield""! What a strange movie reunion.The film just looks beautiful. While I still like the first one better, it's great to see all this cool action and interesting scenarios play out. It's not as much an anthology series as the original film as the characters do interact with each other. It is less confusing that way. Still, the original was better done. I still love the outgoing color effects in this film. Everything just sticks out so perfectly and the atmosphere is great. While a lot of people didn't like it, I myself would recommend it. ***"
