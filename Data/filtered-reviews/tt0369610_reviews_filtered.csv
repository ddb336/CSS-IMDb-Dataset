" So much better than people give it credit for...
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,8,"...though it of course is not without its flaws.Really, the thing that makes this movie, outside of its massive entertainment value, is the meta-aspect. The people running Jurassic World ARE the movie's own producers and are faced with their exact same problems! Watch the movie to see what I am talking about; they lean into this aspect pretty cleverly. (It also explains why there are no feathered dinosaurs, something that some scientists were apparently upset over.)Oh yes, it's also hilarious to see all the outcry over the character Claire being 'sexist' because she is a workaholic jerk who wears high heels. Give me a break. These people will never be finished until all blockbuster female characters are bland, dull, masculine caricatures like Captain Marvel, too scared of political incorrectness to be interesting or even realistic. At least Claire had some personality."
" good
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,10,"I really like jurassic world movies. This one probably is my favorite. I really like the old ones too. I was watching this in cinema and it felt so real, cgi is like 10/10, dinosaurs really felt like real reptiles."
" Could've been stellar
",2021-03-18 00:00:00,6,"Writing is great, CGI is astounding and doesn't even look like CGI, acting is strong, and you have possibly the most accomplished producer in history. How do you go wrong? Plot holes and errors, lots of them. You've got so much potential in an anticipated movie, and it still seems rushed, not thought through, and poorly directed (which makes no sense at all given it's literally Steven Spielberg as the producer). The action and effects are very entertaining. But when you actually think about how extremely stupid these characters have to be to let these events unfold, you feel robbed of a masterpiece."
" Rex....rex.... dinner....please eat me.
",2021-03-17 00:00:00,1,"Really are running out of ideas,not to mention decent scripts &/or writers,possibly the same applies to actors as less than half way through found Howard unbearable.Then there's the irritating Pratt,maybe they should consider resurrecting the franchise in another 65 million years."
" Garbage
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,2,"I've only ever been disappointed with thse sequels. The first film had flaws, but all those since have been atrocious and this is no exception. Only watch this if you can skip through the majority of useless crap the filled it with."
" Like the Original Better
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,6,"Jurassic World was a decent movie. I think it lacked the magic that the original Jurassic Park had. The relationship between Chris Pratt's character and Bryce Dallas Howard's character was not very genuine. The new dinosaurs are fine. The CG is pretty good. Like I said, a decent movie but it's not going to be classic."
" Erm
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,5,This is clearly for kids that don't ask questions. When I saw Chris Pratt talking to the dinosaurs it lost my respect. A dinosaur whisperer! Really. And the two Hollywood kids being the centre stage. Not for the intelligent. HOWEVER the cgi was out of this world.
" Jurassic World review- Hunt for a modified killer dinosaur in a jurassic amusement park
",2021-03-08 00:00:00,10,"This science-fiction film by the director Colin Trevorrow and the executive producer
Steven Spielberg introduces a new Jurassic park trilogy with new dinosaurs in a new
Jurassic park on the same old Island. The film contains a lot of new characters like Chris
Patt as Owen Grady, Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire Dearing and Vincent D'Onfrio as Vik
Hoskins. Some characters from the original Jurassic park trilogy are present too like the
chief geneticist Dr. Henry Wu who is played again by B.D.Wong.Jurassic World is about Zach Mitchell, played by Nick Robinson, and Gray Mitchell, played
by Ty Simpkins, visiting their aunt Claire, who is a senior executive in the amusement park
Jurassic World. The dangerous genetically modified Indominus Rex breaks out and the
two children are lost in the forests on the island. Claire and the raptor trainer Owen Grady
go on search for the two and for the dinosaur while Vik Hoskins tries to turn some dinosaurs
into dangerous weapons, including Owen's raptors.The film has an interesting plot that underlines the Jurassic park theme with many new aspects
like the huge number of visitors who are in the park during this time. The plot forms in my opinion
a good basis for the two sequels of the Jurassic World-trilogy. With a new soundtrack that is very
similar to the original one by John Williams, the Jurassic-park-feeling is given back to me. The special
effects deserve a recognition because the dinosaurs look and move very natural to me.All in all, Jurassic World is an excellent film with great special effects and an interesting plot that combines old and new and is recommended for a wide audience."
" It's a good movie but
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,8,"I was truly disappointed that the stupid kids survived.😂 I wanted to see more sea creatures.
I also learned that high heels are great tools for running and surviving. 😂"
" Jurassic World (2015, Colin Trevorrow) Great special effects can't disguise a derivative plot and silly script
",2021-03-02 00:00:00,5,"Jurassic World (2015, Colin Trevorrow)
There seems to be genuine excitement surrounding this dino sized reboot of the Jurassic Park series and people seem to be exiting fairly pleased. I'm not exactly sure why because this is just a big, bright, shiny object that doesn't stray far from any kind of basic narrative and when you lay back and digest it really is just a glossy rehash of the original film. This iteration of Jurassic Park is always looking for bigger and better both with regards to the film as a real world entity and with the story as well, in an interesting parallel, as if the filmmakers thought we can't just show them dinosaurs anymore we need larger, scarier dinosaurs with more spectacle which is exactly how the characters in the film run their theme park to their ultimate detriment. The original vision from 'Jurassic Park' has been realized and there is a park that is wildly popular however as dinosaur malaise sets in the money people behind the park quickly realize that as ""new"" and more impressive dinosaurs are unveiled attendance and dollars spike and thus begins this game of attempting to one up the last biggest and baddest creation. This leads to cross species genetic engineering and the Indominus Rex which is a nasty, large, violent, smart hybrid which unsurprisingly breaks out of containment and wacky hijinks ensue. You know; running, screaming and the chomping of human popcorn as the dinosaur goes on a rampage. Chris Pratt comes in as the archetype good guy on the side of the dinosaurs and against the evil empire creating new dinosaurs, or at least he seems to be the one person smart enough to know better and see the eventual outcome. Then there is evil corporation who is so blinded that they literally don't realize anything could possibly be wrong until it all goes horribly wrong. This is embodied by Bryce Dallas Howard's head of park operations. She gamely steps up as she realizes the error of her ways mainly because her nephews are conveniently lost and in peril. She is so amazing she can even outrun a T-Rex in heels and receive nary a scratch... Now that's talent! And Pratt's whole dino whisperer thing just had me rolling my eyes. My suspension of disbelief is pretty large but building a camaraderie with velociraptors to the point where one of them shares a tender moment with Pratt near the end had me cringing. There was mild entertainment here but for the most part all that entertainment stems from a template that was almost exactly copied from the original film. 'Jurassic World' may trump 'Jurassic Park' in scale but as for depth and sheer ground breaking spectacle it can't even compete.
Eric's Grade: C"
" this movie was one of the best in the jurassic world franchise
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,10,"Okay, So here is why, firstly it adds a dino called the ""indominus rex"" which is a hybrid of a t rex a velociraptor and a cuttlefish and the indominus rex is extremely badass, the indominus rex literally caused havoc and genocided the herbivores, secondly is referencing the first 1993 movie, after john and gray escape from the indominus rex, they stumble upon a part of the old park, they explore and get a 22 year old jeep working, new characters, new velociraptors and some new dinosaurs as well, if you are a huge jurassic park fan, even if you are not a jurassic park fan, i reccomend this movie."
" Perfectly entertaining
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,7,"I saw ""Jurassic World"" for the first time in 2021, as Cinemark theatres were showing some old favorites - having never seen this during its original theatrical run in 2015, I couldn't resist checking it out. ""Jurassic World,"" directed by Colin Trevorrow, is a perfectly entertaining thriller, serving as both a soft-reboot and sequel to the original ""Jurassic Park"" trilogy.From the moment the camera flies over the park, letting you bask in its sheer scale, ""Jurassic World"" has a great sense of fun and wonder. Dinosaurs perform crowd-pleasing tricks in various attractions, children ooh and aah as they feed miniature dinosaurs at a petting zoo, and crowds gather in utter disbelief at what they are witnessing; everything feels very magical, as it should - the calm before the storm, if you will. Starring Chris Pratt as Owen, ""Jurassic World"" also boasts a charismatic and badass star that's believable in his confidence around dinosaurs, and along with his chemistry alongside Bryce Dallas Howard's character, Claire, the film has a strong sense of emotional resonance that is sure to keep you invested.One thing I really enjoyed about this movie was the slow burn approach it took before throwing you into the chaos - it let viewers feel comfortable and bask in the glory of the park before unleashing the dinosaurs on them. And if you're watching ""Jurassic World,"" you're likely wondering how the dinosaur action is - the answer is: very badass. There are multiple intense action sequences here, and the slow burn really enhances the thrill and makes the inevitable dread more effective. The CGI is genuinely impressive and immersive, and the entire film feels like a big roller-coaster, and it works. This isn't a movie that you go to for its Oscar-winning plot, but instead to kill two hours and have some fun, and it delivers.And speaking of the two hour runtime, my only complaint would be that the movie feels a touch too long. I feel like if 15 to 20 minutes were shaved off this film it would've been the perfect thriller, but the two hour length does slightly overstay its welcome. That said, I had a lot of fun in this movie, and never found myself bored, which is always a good sign. So, if you're a fan of the original ""Jurassic Park"" trilogy, check this out! You'll be sure to enjoy."
" A new entertaining movie in the franchise.
",2021-02-26 00:00:00,8,"Wow. I did not see another sequel coming. Or is it a sequel? Yes, it is.The original ""Jurassic Park"" from 1993 is a classic and the best dinosaur movie ever made. Then it got two sequels, one starring supporting actor Jeff Goldblum, and one starring lead actor Sam Neill for the second time. The sequels are pretty underrated, and they just stopped making more. Until 2015, a giant blockbuster I bet you didn't see coming. Yeah, what was once a park, is now a world. Jurassic World!This was a great way to start a new trilogy. This is is half a sequel, and half a reboot. It starts a new series while continuing another. And it works pretty well. Now we're able to see the diosaurs eat people in modern fashion.This is what a dinosaur movie should be. It doesn't surpass the original in any way, but does the most of the stuff perfectly well. There is for example a scene where Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson jump down a waterfall when they're escaping from a dinosaur. And I spend a lot of time thinking if I would do the same thing? I hate heights, but I'm not a big fan of being eaten alive by a dinosaur either. So I would certainly jump.Now, let's talk about the casting. I love the cast of this movie. In lead roles, you've got that guy from Parks And Rec and GotG, and that lady from Spider-Man 3 and Rocketman. In smaller roles, you've got Ty Simpkins (Iron Man 3) and Nick Robinson (Love, Simon) as the nephews of Bryce Dallas Howard. They're lovely in this movie. You've also got that guy from The Office and that girl from 13 Going On 30 as their parents. Fun fact: How likely is it that Judy Greer played the same role as a family mom who's worried for her family in Ant-Man (which also came out the same year). I even had forgot that actors like Jake Johnson, Vincent D'Onofrio and Lauren Lapkus was in this movie. I recently rewatched this movie, after 5 years.But everything in this movie is a blast and fun to watch. The only thing I don't like in this movie, is the final battle between two major dinosaurs (don't remember any dinosaur's name). It feels a little bit boring, but not, like, ""boring"" as the final battle in Scott Pilgrim vs. The World (which, btw, was not boring), but boring like the whole Godzilla: King Of The Monsters. It literally has one hour total destruction with two monsters fighting each other, and guess what?? I slept through the whole thing. But in Jurassic World, it only lasts for like fifteen minutes.But besides for that, this is a very fun movie to watch, and I liked it a lot. Not as good as the first one, but good enough to entertain (cause that's the whole purpose)."
" BEST JURASSIC PARK SEQUEL
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,8,"Set 22 years after the original Jurassic Park, Jurassic World revolves around a functional theme park featuring dinosaurs, which is then thrown into chaos when a genetic hybrid known as the Indominus rex escapes containment. The dinosaurs are bigger, better and have more teeth to satisfy the paying public. Trevorrow brought his dinosaurs to life in ways never before imaginable. The movie has plenty of heart, humour, excitement and suspense. Jurassic World is an entertaining and visually dazzling popcorn thriller.

" A solid reboot of the original Jurassic Park trilogy
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,7,"Jurassic World was released twenty-two years after the original Jurassic Park movie and it proves to be a solid reboot of it and its two sequels, even though it comes with a plot that develops in a nearly identical fashion and the characters that it features are very similar to the ones featured in the primordial movie as well.It is also true that there are some plot elements in Jurassic World that feel slightly obsolete in a movie that was released in the 2010s and the connection to the previous three Jurassic Park movies is a bit illogical. On the other hand, Jurassic World works relatively well as a separate movie and it does happen to add a few cool new visual elements in comparison with its predecessors and the sci-fi standards of the 1990s. The special effects are just as impressive as the scenery, even though the latter makes for another visual element that is virtually identical to what had already been seen in the original trilogy.Although the characters are not very original, the performances turn out to be pretty good for the most part of the film's running time and Jurassic World does not feel very long for a movie that runs for a full two hours, despite the fact that there do happen to be some less exciting stages in the presentation of its story."
" Two mistakes
",2021-02-18 00:00:00,8,"1 - wet matchsticks can't be used
2 - how Dino in paddock 9 was standing near gates to come out and ready to engage in fight"
" Exciting if implausible and ful, of plot holes.
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,7,"Was Henry Wu genetically re-engineered for Jurassic World? He was killed by veloceraptors in the first film. And considering how many people were munched in the first two films is it possible that human greed can honestly produce such monumentally foolish and ignorant people? Well, according to Hollywood: Yes. Claire and just about everyone associated with the park is obsessed with greed and blinded by tech. It's all rather disgusting."
" Jurassic of the Galaxy.
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,5,A lack-luster reboot and movie.its about techno dino's going rogue and people trying to get away.Visually its beautiful and yet movie wise it just didn't care. I thought about seeing the 2nd take and often times I forget about it.Verdict: Its not the worse it just doesn't leave you wanting more.
" Do yourselves a favour, watch something else this quarantine season.
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,1,"Yes, I'm late to this party. I didn't see this film when it premiered back in 2015. There was a ton of negative buzz online at the time and -thankfully, for me- I took note and avoided it at the theatres. Thank God, because I might have been sick right there during the screening. However, we are going through some trying times and the lockdowns wore me down enough that I ended up watching this.First of all, lets look at our protagonists: Both ""heroes"" are horrible human beings.The male character is a ""dinosaur whisper"". A quality that goes against everything Jurassic Park has taught us these past 20something years. Would I be willing to bend the rules if it was worth my time? Maybe, but the way this developed in the film wasn't ground-breaking enough for me to justify a human and his pet (partner?) raptor fist bumping like a kid and his dog in a TV movie.The female character is a cold blooded capitalist who looked at the loose beasts, and then looked at the thousands of visitors and then thought ""oh no, my profits!"". Maybe if I wasn't watching this from a 3rd lockdown that was the direct result of a government leadership incapable of controlling a pandemic, due to its initial choice to prioritise profit over human lives, I'd be more inclined to give this lady a shot at redemption? Perhaps. Let's assume I did choose to allow her to become a better person in this film. She doesn't! She doesn't learn her lesson!Her and the dinosaur dude are -literally- the reason why all these people lost their lives, and yet I'm expected to sit there and accept the film as ending happily for those 2 monsters!On a side note, there are 2 children in this film. They are annoying.Finally, lets talk about the violence. I saw the first Jurassic Park as a kid, and while it was a fairly violent film, I wasn't exactly ""scared"" by it. It was an adventure, with some goriest mishaps than one would expect, like the Brendan Fraser ""The Mummy"" franchise.Now as an adult, I'm horrified to admit that Jurassic World made me sick. Specifically, the violent death of the female assistant (Zara, the only character name I remember. Scratch that, the only character name worth remembering) is one that completely horrified me. It went on forever. It was excessive and needlessly brutal. The woman's screams have been imprinted onto my brain. I had to take a break after it, and I can't believe it happened in the middle of the film.Was I expected to watch a character be brutalised like that on screen and then sit around to watch the rest of the characters joke and get a happy ever after?Zara was a young woman who -as far as we knew- was engaged to be married, and worked as an assistant to the main female character. She was charged with looking after a couple of extremely irritating children along with the rest of her duties and -again, as far as we know- the only thing ""wrong"" about her, is that she lost said children in the crowd at some point. In our eyes as viewers, Zara didn't deserve such a graphic death. As viewers, we're not going to move forward from that easily. At least I didn't, the rest of the film flew past my eyes and I was left with an upset stomach and a brain with only half of its cells intact.Not only is this film a complete waste of time, it might traumatise you. Do yourselves a favour, watch something else this quarantine season."
" stupid
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,1,"Horrible piece of crap, why would dinosaurs become senseless creatures that attack humans like the plague? It makes no sense at all, Is the message of the movie: Humans Suck? if it is, I guess they nailed it. Terrible acting as well; other than maybe Jake and Chris."
" Great formula to revive a great franchise
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,8,"Finally, jurassic park ... or rather ... jurassic world is open, again, isla nublar brings our action and horror scenes, well, I don't want to give spoilers."
" Good one
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,9,"It's more exciting than jurassic park actually, the connection between previous films was interesting"
" Riding with the raptors through the jungle - awesome
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,8,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is the sci-fi action adventure flick Jurassic World (2015) the sequel or should I say, soft reboot of the Jurassic Park series. We find ourselves in a world where after twenty so years we now have an active park open for business in Isla Nublar. That's right, after the disaster of the original park, the island also known as Jurassic World, is open to the public. Won't people ever learn? So now we have dinosaurs and people, like a zoo however in the background we have scientists and greedy people who are continuously exploiting the study of genetics. Due to the executives needing to gain more market share and more money, they need more impressions which means, more teeth. The scientists on the park genetically engineer a new breed of dinosaur, the Indominus Rex and what happens when a monster is created from the science lab escapes from its cage? It prowls around onto the park with a knack to hunt and kill...so yeh everything goes horribly wrong!This new world still touches on the original series, which can be highlighted by the control guy wearing the original Jurassic Park shirt proudly. The new flick has awesome new characters - one in particular played by the always cool Chris Pratt who plays Owen Grady, an ex-military who trains a group of raptors since they were hatched. He plays out the alpha to the raptors. Grady's character understands that dinosaurs are living creatures, not science tests. Pratt's performance is awesome here, the motor bike scene through the jungle among the raptors on the pursuit of the Indominus Rex was savage and gangster. His training of the raptors and his bond with one in particular, Blue is cool as. The co-stars including Bryce Dallas Howard playing as Claire has her own moments from a corporate marketing slave to yeppp we stuffed up and now its to save people I love and survive. One thing I do not get is what is with the heels????? To me I feel like the writers held her back, she did have a cool bit with the T-Rex, but again the heels?? As mentioned, there are throwbacks to the original including the mad scientist Dr. Henry Wu, the DNA cartoon which you see for a second or two, the analogy of birds and dinosaurs, how flares hype up a T-Rex and Hammond's ""spare no expense"" phrase.The director does justice in this film by ensuring there is a homage to the original films while making this new flick its own. There are other great parts including the Indominus Rex having camouflage like abilities, an unlikely prehistoric duo battling the Indominus Rex, which is really impressive and a great watch of the final battle. I also like how the T-Rex went through the Spinosaurus skeleton as a nod to the third flick 😉 A few nods include the pterosaurs flying around the resort and the death of an unlucky assistant who gets devoured by the park's whale like attraction, the Mosasaurus. Unlike its original predecessor there is no animatronics, so the film is heavy on the CGI. If you like action and adventure and how man and dinosaur can fight side by side, then watch this film - overall 8.2/10"
" Worth the watch
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,10,You can't be the old classic Jurassic park but this is one of the best films of 2015 it would have been nice if it was just a stand alone film but overall it's good that they made part 2 of the 2015 film Jurassic world.
" C'mon - perfectly reasonable sequel
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,8,"Plenty of nods to predecessors and a perfectly reasonable development if Hammond's dream in a major park becoming operational, with the inevitable mishaps - I liked it, family and friends liked it and frankly got the entertainment from it we wanted - it was enjoyed a great deal more than JP2, and worked far better by keeping the story and the action localised too. Happy to give this a good score."
" I Hate This Movie
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,2,"Firstly, let's establish that the entire reason this movie currently exists is for Spielberg to continue making gobs of money.Secondly, let's also establish that the director is waaay out of his depth on this one. Having helmed ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" (which is a solid little indie romcom that I enjoy) it's clear that promoting him so drastically in budget, scale, and material is not something that should have been green lit. But here we are.This movie relies almost entirely on the nostalgic goodwill of the audience. I'm sure many of the adults watching grew up adoring Jurassic Park and are eager to share that thrill and enjoyment with their own kids with the new franchise. However, so much of the heart and soul of Jurassic Park lies in Spielberg's deft balance of action sequences and emotion. Jurassic World has absolutely none of that as it handles each new sequence with a ham fist. There are glimmers, of course, like the slaughtering of the brachiosaurus at the hands of the new mutant dinosaur, but just as quickly as it appears, it's gone again.I will admit, I was taken in at moments, my mind drifting into excitement at the discovery of the original park, the revving of those original Jeep engines, the concept of having a raptor as a really intense, really cool dog... I found these moments enjoyable, but none of it has anything to do with the reason the original story took place in the first place-that man should not play God. Clearly no one listened because Spielberg and Co continue to beat a dead horse because ""dinosaurs are cool"" and apparently that's all anyone expects from this franchise.The original is first and foremost science fiction, with the happy opportunity of being directed by the godfather of the summer blockbuster; It falls into the pleasant position of being excellent at both. However, Jurassic World is just a Frankenstein's Monster dressed in a vintage Jurassic Park t-shirt asking you to love it as it's slowly strangling you to death."
" Yeay! The jurrasic park finally open!
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,10,Jurrasic park has finally open for everyone. we know its a big risk to open that kind of park because one little mistake can ruin everything.All the cast is splendid!and i love when that t-rex is still the one who is powerful and it is the hero of the movie alongside with the raptors.
" it became my favorite movie
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,10,I realy like the movie because i love dinasours (especially t-rexex) and yeah i love it so much i watched it a million times now 😂
" Graceful, popcorn filled thrilling and tense, taught and energetic. This trilogy gets much better as it goes on.
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,"Successfully expands from park to world. Truly, it's a Jurassic world after all. Even though Steven Spielberg didn't direct it, he's still the executive producer. The visuals were thrilling and spectacular and so was the plot line. As the time passes on, the visuals get more artistic and realistic. This trilogy series never wears out it's welcome, I wonder what they will think of next Jurassic Space? I hope this film continues to receive critical acclaim as it's a dazzling popcorn thriller and it's emotionally and visually exciting.I think in the fifth film, there should be dinosaurs in space or the dinosaurs are attacking aliens. The CGI gets better as the years go on and it successfully replicates and in some ways improves the behaviours of the dinosaurs when they react with humans with the dinosaurs violent behaviours sure to thrill the entire audience!"
" Insultingly bad, unimaginative and poorly stitched together
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,1,"Bryce Dallas Howard could have been a great protagonist for this new trilogy if the director didn't seem to hate her, and all other female characters for that matter. There's evidence of a smart character that is destroyed by cliches and bad design and writing decisions."
" Irrfan Khan
",2020-10-18 00:00:00,10,"I miss Irrfan Khan so. when I watch his acting, somehow his sincerity in his art gave me hope. as popular as he was, I still think he was under-rated. He was a true mega talent and gone way too soon. condolences to his friends and family."
" It deserves to keep the name 'Jurassic'
",2020-10-14 00:00:00,8,"'Jurassic World' has a great name to live up to. It is a sequel to one of the revolutionary film in the history. Real-life actualization of child's favorite imaginary friend exactly as he or she sees in the book was sensational. Adventures in dinosaur land was that exciting, thrilling, and powerful.'Jurassic World' follows the similar build-up of the story with modern touch and bigger scale. It utilizes computer technique developed exponentially in 20 years. Dinosaur's blood, scar, movement, and even facial expression are more realistic. Entertainment aspect is bigger than the last movie. New spices added; more utilities in the amusement park; visual effect is more appealing. Also, the fact dinosaurs interact with human-beings shortens the distance between two species' relationship. Dinosaur stays friends for kids even after the movie.Only fault... Even dinosaurs look so real, Bryce Dallas Howard's running in hills all day at full speed keeps reminding the audience it's still a movie."
" Popcorn movie night
",2020-10-09 00:00:00,6,"Set your expectations realistically. A predictable blockbuster style popcorn movie night film.
Acting is alright. Story is very similar to previous films. Nothing overwhelmingly original. Most fascinating thing was the continuation with the story of Henry Wu from the original film.
Pacing was fine.
Really enjoyed how they incorporated the old score into the new score.
Interested enough to see the next film and what direction they will take it."
" Not-so-bad comeback
",2020-10-08 00:00:00,5,Just a generic action film. It feels sometimes good and sometimes bad.
" Could have been better
",2020-10-02 00:00:00,6,"In all fairness, this movies wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. Clishes, corny lines, but some scenes were exciting. There was just something wrong with it. I don't know what btu there was just a mist in the air that was bad. Come to think of it, it probably because its kind of like a remake, not really. Anyway, i would give it a 6.9"
" Jurassic critters run wild (again)...
",2020-09-16 00:00:00,7,"Now then, as stories go this is an huge pile of dino-droppings - but Chris Pratt does his level best, alongside some pretty bad-assed dinosaurs to keep this action adventure exciting. When the new ""Jurassic World"" theme park is opened, it builds on the promise of it's doomed predecessor but this time, they have state of the art safety facilities to protect the visiting lunch box brigade. Or do they? Unfortunately for them, ""Indominus Rex"", wasn't at the read-through and has a mind to eat just about anything he can wrap his jaws around. What he can't devour, his eager - recently released - friends from elsewhere in the park are plenty keen on too - so we quickly find ourselves with a ""containment anomaly"" that leads to a distinct carnage scenario for our hero to avert. As ever, Pratt brings oodles of personality to his role as the velociraptor's pal, but the rest of the cast - to an human - are poor. The kids grate and ought to have been eaten very early on, and gazillionaire Irrfan Khan (""Masrani"") is way to dapper and refined to be a convincing baddie. Vincent D'Onofio tries to help out, at least his part has some meat to it, but otherwise this is just a cracking victory for Pratt and some outstanding visual effects without even a rousing score from John Williams to rely upon and some storylines that are contrived to maximise the menace and minimise the plausibility. If you can find it showing on a big screen anywhere, then it is still worth watching on a wet afternoon, but it loses much of any potency it ever had on the small screen and I'm not sure I'd bother again."

" Jurassic Choo's
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,5,"Holiday movie night with Iris/ Gertie.With restricted entertainment options in a holiday home, your critical bar is lowered. This is mostly twaddle, and you can see every plot development a mile off. But you can laugh at a heroine who does the 100m in high heels, and the theme park does seem the logical direction for Planet Jurassic."
" 4th one is better than the 2nd & 3rd ones
",2020-08-18 00:00:00,8,"Jurassic World, the 4th installment of the iconic franchise actually serves quite a good dish on our plates.
Better than the 2nd film and way better than the 3rd one, this movie might not feel like what Jurassic Park gave us but it still the best one after the original 1993 film, till date.
A complete rollercoaster ride, this movie goes through a lot of twists and turns and gives a lot of goosebumps now and then, which is really appreciable.
The acting might slack a little bit but the CGI and especially the major villain the Indo-Rex is pretty impressive.
Those dinosaur fights are good and the entrance of Rexy(T-Rex) from the paddock 9 was thrilling, impressive and iconic.
All in all, I will give it a 8."
" Despised Bryce DH, loved the rest
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,8,She is AWFUL. If she wasnt ron Howard's daughter I'd say she'd be doing makeup in a department store but I feel That's an insult to them. They have more talent than that. Loved the rest of the movie loved Chris Pratt love the 2 boys loved blue loved Omar Sy and I especially loved Irfan Khan. Hes a scene stealer and that's the reason they killed him off and that was a stupid thing to do. Please let this man carry a movie because hes brilliant
" Incredible
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,9,It was really incredible better than Jurassic World fallen kingdom because jurassic world fallen kingdom was just action not to much story I hope jurassic world 3 extinction will be better tha jurassic world fallen kingdom good job.
" The Jurassic franchise lives
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,6,Film four in this franchise was as enjoyable as it's predecessors; simply put in the title you know what is going to be served up in these franchise of films.
" Fun to watch but very unrealistic
",2020-07-15 00:00:00,4,"This is one of those movies where you just turn off your brain and enjoy the ride. How many times can they rehash the exact same plot where humans go into a dinosaur environment and get eaten by them? That formula got stale after the 2nd J.P. movie. And Bryce Dallas Howard's character in high heels outrunning a T-Rex??? Yeah, like I said just turn off your brain and enjoy the ride."
" Not amazing, but the best sequel in the franchise
",2020-07-13 00:00:00,7,"Jurassic world is not perfect, it has a lot of flaws like the most of the characters are uninteresting, the villain is very bland with a wasted Vincent d'onofrio, Bryce Dallas Howard is half good and half bad in the movie, and the kids are just a bore to watch. But it has a lot of great things in it like the action is fun especially the final battle, the visual effects are great, seeing the park open to the public is interesting, and Chris Pratt is amazing and is the only fun and interesting character. A fun popcorn flick that has flaws but is a fun watch."
" Great return to Isla Nublar
",2020-07-08 00:00:00,7,"Chris Pratt brings a lot to this one, lol! He and Howard make great leads together.If you liked the first 3,, you'll like this,,,So go watch it!"
" A few great parts can't make up for a terrible script
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,5,"Awful characters cut out of cardboard and a recycled plot almost sink a movie with a couple of cool ""thrill"" scenes, but overall it's a rehash with a preposterously stupid premise that falls apart to anyone with a brain."
" Good time escape
",2020-07-02 00:00:00,8,"Enjoy watching the Jurassic World's movies the CG has advanced and I like the new characters, stories and actors."
" Visually stunning!
",2020-07-01 00:00:00,8,"This film is so visually stunning I feel obligated to score it 8/10 despite the worst script for a high budget movie I have ever witnessed. By ratio of budget to script quality it has to be the most atrocious. It goes without say the fine folks down at Universal Studios have a keen eye for breath taking visuals, but still have a lot to learn in human psychology and what constitutes realistic dialogue and dare I say ""They don't even understand basic small talk??"" Chris Pratt was phenomenal as usual, but after him the acting quality takes a massive nosedive. The only way I can possibly justify how this is possible is that Pratt had to be given some looser boundaries with how he was able to
Perform his lines vs the other actors in the movie and thank heavens the director allowed this. There is no other way you can explain how Pratt seemed so much more authentic and genuine than any of the actors in the film. Without Pratt's personality and improvisations which brought this movie to life it may have been just another generic robotic movie! If they can maintain the visual effects and improve the script for the future I think we have some great Jurassic Park movies coming down the pipe for the future!"
" spectacular film
",2020-06-25 00:00:00,10,"JURASSIC WORLD is a spectacular film, the visual effects are stunning, has new dinosaurs and has spectacular action scenes with suspense like the first film. I advise everyone to watch it.."
" Despite following the same formula as the original, it manages to be a sequence with several elements of a reboot, bringing new aspects to the franchise
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,8,"Many years after the release of the third part of the initial trilogy, Universal Studios revitalizes the franchise based on the work of Michale Crichton, trying to expand it and explore new aspects related to the original plot. The emulation of situations, character characteristics and narrative with the original 1993 film is notorious, in the script originally written by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver and which was later rewritten by Derek Connolly and director Colin Trevorrow himself. The great merit of this fourth film is that, despite following the same formula as the original, it manages to be a sequence with several elements of a reboot, bringing new aspects, charismatic characters and still paying tribute and referencing the classic directed by Spielberg.Colin Trevorrow's production lives up to the franchise and adopts a light tone, almost of a juvenile adventure, to snatch families around the world. The synopsis of the film is interesting. Show the park already open, under the attack of a genetically modified dinosaur. In fact, the premise is very similar to the 1993 production, only in a megalomaniacal way. Although everything has become so grand and somewhat artificial, it is possible to be moved by the first scenes showing the place and the attractions. However, certain exaggerations are notable. The aquatic dinosaur is a strong example. There is a lack of subtlety in the direction of the inexperienced Colin Trevorrow. A product of this magnitude should have been delivered to someone with more luggage. The excess of characters, mostly clichés, hinder the progress and weaken the script.
And it is in one of the many possible parallels to be drawn between one work and another that Jurassic World finds its potential: the scene of the sick dinosaur, being taken care of by the protagonists of the original film, returns, adapted to a scenario in which a threat kills animals for pure sport, something more human than bestial. In this resumption, similar to the iconic moment of the classic, one of the few uses of animatronics here, Jurassic World extracts as much as it can from the viewer on an emotional level, since the rest is very superficial. In the other cases, we opted for creations made entirely on the computer, which work well, but have an expiration date. The intimacy of the relationship between man and creature is savored by the script, especially in the connection of the character Owen (Chris Pratt) with the velociraptors, something much better resolved than the other communication made with this species of dinosaur, in the third adventure of the franchise.We also have the figure of the new owner of the park, Masrani (Irrfan Khan), who somehow inherits the park from John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), a former magnate and owner of Nublar Island. Khan's character is a new investor who decided to reopen and continue the genetic research initiated by Hammond. Right away the motivation of Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan) to reopen the complex is not clear, because the result is so impressive that the audience is moved by the Park's variability and news. The writers also do not bother to answer some pertinent questions: how was the dinosaur containment problem solved in Islas Nublar and Sorna? Why reopen the park in the same place?
We still see an old character appear again. Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong), who was also one of the scientists of the original park, here being responsible for a turn at the end of the plot, reminding another scientist of yore. The villain Vic Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio), who has a peculiar interest in velociraptors, has an outstanding intelligence when respecting their tamer Owen Grady. But the peace of the thousands of tourists in the Park ends when a hybrid dinosaur manages to escape its confinement and becomes the target of InGen Security administrators, who intend to use the new genetics of the most evolved dinosaurs as lethal weapons in the field. The big problem is that the villain is very poorly developed and stereotyped, not posing any real threat.For fans of the franchise, the script still reserves moments of pure nostalgia, whether through the shirt of the original Jurassic Park, or through the tracks and even a car from the same park. Obviously, one of the ingredients that should be well presented in any film in the franchise is dinosaurs. This time, the T-Rex are lagging behind the new threat of this film. With a certain suspense to fully reveal the look of the Indominus Rex - the invincible dinosaur, the special effects contribute to the fantastic tone of the tape and make good use of the beautiful landscapes of Hawaii (chosen to represent the fictional Isla Nubar in Costa Rica). The psychological dimension that Indominus gains thanks to Owen Grady's constant explanations - in fact, the writers use it to explain the film in different scenes. With that, the best character is the hybrid dinosaur. The mosasaur is incredible and the classic scenes with the apatosaurs and triceratops are honored with mastery by the director Colin Trevorrow. The pteranodon and dimorphodon flyers carry the scenes of tension in the film. The villain, Indominus Rex (hybrid) swallows and devours some humans in times of great hunger and anger, while Chris Pratt and his team of Velociraptors prepare for the final hunt. Adventurer Owen Grady's relationship with one of the tamed velociraptors is satisfactorily developed, so much so that you can empathize with Owen and Blue. The proposal to transform one of the villains of the first film into allies is something intelligent and unprecedented.Not everything works plausibly in this eight-handed script. This usually results in a fragmented, contradictory, sometimes stupid, pamphleteering film that has sudden changes in the atmosphere or that has missing characters. Because that's exactly what happens here. Because of a more demanding audience, unable to settle for just dinosaurs (or, presumably, Jurassic Park), the opening of the park comes together with the interest of scientists in the creation of a genetically created creature modified, because that's probably a good idea. For a change, it is not, creating a work with a very predictable character, a statement that suffers a small break in the final third of the work, full of twists, some intelligent, some extremely forced, but none sufficient, justifiable.
Undoubtedly, there is an excess of narrative nuclei thanks to the infinity of characters - which hinders the progress of the story. The first act is lost among the attractions of the park, the pamphlet didacticism, the construction of a bad romance and the growing threat of Indominus. Several times the dialogues deal with criticisms about animal rights, notion of ownership, feelings of dinosaurs and capitalist brands - something completely bizarre since during the film there are countless merchandisings which shows the hypocrisy of the text.The director of the classic feature, Steven Spielberg, acting here as executive producer, wanted to lead the viewer to the idea that animatronics is inferior to images generated by computer graphics. One of the biggest curiosities I had about Jurassic World was about the special effects. Twenty-two years later, a lot has changed in the business. Nowadays it is much easier to create computerized dinosaurs. Fortunately, they did not abandon animatronics for the proximity scenes, and they still work very well on stage. This time, they used much more CGI, making it possible to show more dinosaurs. You gain in quantity, but you lose in reality. The artificial content of animals was not uncommon. A very plausible justification is that they have a lot more screen time than before. In the first three films, most of the tension was created by the performances, the script and the soundtrack. Even with good production design, the intense use of computer graphics to bring animals to life is inexcusable. All the other Jurassic Park - films made on smaller budgets - used the incredible animatronics designed and made by Stan Winston in different ways. Here, they use the realistic technique only on the head of an apatosaurus in a simple scene that can only thrill thanks to the use of ancient technology.The park itself is also magnificently discovered by the viewer, far from the rusticity of the original work, close to the futuristic technological and, in short, unlike the idea brought with the primitive dinosaurs - an interesting antithesis. However, realize that, while in the original film the classic theme found its peak in the first magnificent appearance of the dinosaurs, here, when we open the windows of a room, comfortable and comfortable, the ""world of dinosaurs"" is introduced to the viewer, observing more constructions that creatures in fact. The park is the real spectacle. Technology faces nature.Finally, it is worth highlighting the fact that ""Jurassic World"" does not update itself even in the criticism that makes human attempts to ""turn God"" and to create new animals in the laboratory irresponsibly, or to ""objectify"" animals and turn them into sources of income. In fact, there is always the feeling of hypocrisy when the film criticizes the endless search for profit and news to ""continue to enchant the public"", since Universal itself has a theme park in Orlando, and it certainly does the same. Still, ""Jurassic World"" is entertaining. From the immersive epic soundtrack of Michael Giacchino (Oscar winner for ""Up"") to the childlike wonder of the boy Gray (although he is not the protagonist), it is possible to notice Spielberg's finger (hand, arm, claws) on new park. With a tone of adventure and unpretentiousness that comes closest to Jurassic Park III, director Colin Trevorrow tries his best to present an above average film and does not disappoint."
" Jurassic world
",2020-06-19 00:00:00,8,"OK, I read the 2 novels before the original movies came out, and was hooked back in 1991/92 when the original movie came out. Fell in love! And really have enjoyed the 2 sequels for what they're worth. Then, came out with Jurassic World, used our favorite Starkilled... and we have an amazing movie. I'm still riding a high from seeing it last night. It was just so good. I spoiled a few moments for myself, but overall was still surprised at the ending, despite it's Mortal Kombat predicted finish. The CGI was top notch and had us really believing these creatures were real. A worthy movie to see over and over again. I really do not want to spoil a THING. I would not say this movie is sexist in anyway... not sure where people picked up on that, but will say it is heavy on the testosterone(did I spell that correctly?). Which isn't a bad thing. Jurassic World has a wonderful build up, some good personalities, and a few main 'side characters' are killed off! We see some personalities actually change through the movie. Claire, Zach, and even Gray and Owen to some extent. I'll say this: Claire learns some humility and heart. Zach learns real love over shallowness to some extent, Gray learns true courage, and Owen (with already enough faith and trust) gains even more (and a fan club). Though the one character who comes back... I wonder if they grew his character more from a twisted version from the original novel. (Real the original novel!)Don't let the trailers anger you, you will root for the raptors, and you will LIKE IT! The raptors aren't exactly 'tamed', barely. Think Dug from Up. This is the true sequel to the original movie Michael refused to give Spielberg years ago... instead Creighton wrote about irregular students outside of the norm, attached to a character akin to Spielberg's personality, and gave us a more boring version of Malcolm (that sung Dixie no less), and Harding, who was a woman who to was hard to understand and not very likable. And the end of the second book was... lackluster to say the least. Not want Spielberg wanted. Still a good novel and fun read.The island is back, the locations, the look, and we see some of its 'history' (wish we saw more of the attractions). This is the true sequel and it the summer smash for 2015. If you like the original Jurassic Park movie, you can not miss out on this movie. It fits so well, and open enough for a few questions and a sequel. Which makes one think... they could... no wait, can't say it. It might spoil the ending! Ha ha! They do mourn a character that dies. A plot twist here or there... the final fight is simply amazing. Cool tributes to the original movie (and Stan Winston - there's a building named after him, look for it, I saw it!) This was an excellent movie and a definite 10 in my book. Easily rewatchable.Please note, it seemed a little more gory than the previous movies with a little more blood. The cursing was actually minimal. I wouldn't take anyone under 7 or 8 to see it. The gore was kind of cool though. More detail than we had in the originals other than ""I think this was Gennaro..."" Great movie, plenty of dino on dino fighting action. Don't listen to the naysayers. No contrived endless conversations about dinosaur behavior here."
" Eh....
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,5,"I recently watched this because it was the anniversary of the original JP and wanted to check out other installments in the series. UGH! What a mistake... it is all down hill from the original and I am not enthusiastic about checking out the sequel to this one.This is just another watered-down HOLLYWOOD cash grab. Sure, there are some good effects and some neat ideas, but all in all, we've seen this movie three times before!... Once was enough.If you're still not sure, take a good look at the poster! Chris Pratt (hot off of Guardians of the Galaxy) riding a motorcycle among dinosaurs. When you think of all the money that was spent on this film and what it could have made, or funded, it's a a shame."
" The Park Is Open
",2020-06-15 00:00:00,2,Absolutely Boring Didn't Like this one at all it was very disappointing
" Pretty underrated film
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,7,I thought this film was very dumb but extremely entertaining it's basically the perfect movie that u can stick on in the background and have a really good time some scenes even captured the thrills from the original and introduces some pretty dumb but quite interesting ideas and that's why I really enjoy it
" Parks, uh.....find a way
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,8,"Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend.Being that its not the original Jurassic Park, it's marvelous. Its actually good to see a continuation of the things we love instead of heartless reboots, made for merchandise.Starting over with a new park really feels like the way to go, and allowing corporate interference to be the catalyst to this movie's disaster sequence.The animals are all done super well, even if they're not the practical masterpieces of the original movie. The Indominus Rex remind me of a big killer dog, which helps turn down some of the graphic quality of the violence for me.Its definitely worth the watch, and (Pratt racing raptors aside) I'm actually excited just writing about it."
" Disappointing.
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,3,"You would think a film about dinosaurs living on a volcano would be nigh on impossible to be boring, but somehow they managed it."
" Good return
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,8,"This film is a good return to the original series. It is more like a reboot in that it introduces new characters and scenarios. However, it has the familiar elements and park. It expands a bit with some meta-commentary on needing new dinosaur species because audiences are no longer impressed by the originals. However, some of the scenarios were contrived and there were some questionable scenes."
" Welcome to Jurassic Park
",2020-05-30 00:00:00,6,"You really don't have to watch this movie to know what's gonna happen. And while it is exciting simply based on the source material the movie is almost identical to Jurassic Park. They even have the same characters but different names.Claire is John Hammond. She even wears white the whole movie.
You have the two kids who need someone to save them
You have Dennis working in the control room
And Chris Pratt is the Dino expert aka Dr. Grant.It's a fun movie, don't get me wrong, but it is Jurassic Park. They try to spice it up here and there but feel like the execution feels forced in an effort to make it stand apart. Not sure it really works.Jurassic World gets a 6/10"
" This is how you do it
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,10,"As a massive Jurassic park fan I was worried when they were going to bring out Jurassic world.... well I was wrong to be, this film was perfectly done a perfect balance between nostalgia and bringing a different dimension to the franchise."
" More Genetic Engineering Stuff Ups
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,5,"Once again I have decided to continue to watch the Jurassic Park series for some rather unknown reason. I guess it had to do with simply wanting to watch through the series, not that I have huge amounts of time on my hands anyway. So, I've got up to this film, which no doubt was released some time after the previous one, so of course we have different actors, and a different situation as well. Well, not quite because this is still a film about rampaging dinosaurs, and if you have seen the previous ones, then you pretty much can guess what happens in this one as well.However, since numerous years have passed, the park has now opened to the public and it is basically this huge amusement park where people can go around looking at dinosaurs. However, as with all capitalist ventures, they need ways to be able to keep the people entertained, and as such they decide to create this completely new dinosaur. Mind you, as well all stupid human endeavours, the genetically engineered dinosaur escapes and starts running rampant around the park, pretty much killing anybody and everybody.Yeah, as I mentioned, it is basically pretty much like the other three films, except that there are a lot more people, and the park is also operating. Oh, and they have new actors in it as well, so I guess there is that, though I do have to admit that I did quite like Chris Pratt's character, but then again he is able to pull off his roles pretty good anyway. However, unlike the other main characters in the previous films, he seems to be one of those guys whose job is to basically train dinosaurs.Mind you, one interesting thing that is raised in the previous film, and sort of sticks with me here, is that these creatures aren't strictly dinosaurs. The reason for that is that while they have been constructed using genetic material from dinosaurs, these creatures have also had other genes spliced into them to fix up the missing bits. So, as Sam Neill's character mentioned, he doesn't consider them to be legitimate dinosaurs, which is why he would prefer to go back to his digs, not that people are all that interested in them anymore.Yeah, this film was okay, at least for entertainment value, but it really doesn't stand out as much as, well, other films that I have watched. In the end it is just basically more dinosaurs running around terrorising people, and a couple of kids being caught up in the middle of everything. I guess one sort of starts to get a bit sick of dinosaurs after a while, though I do note that they do play up the theme park aspect of the place much more than they did in the previous films."
" ridiculous!
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,3,"Action and adventure movies like this one is always fun to watch.
But this one is so ridiculous in many ways, like kids missing but no one thought of calling them on their cell phone, breaking cell phones signals all the time, broadcast only comes on and creating panic the last second before all the flying dinosaurs are coming in to hurt people, the boys knowing they are in a park with certain level of danger but would happily head into the restricted area...
but one of the worst parts is Bryce Howard is on her heels the whole time during all the chase and all the running around! REALLY?! ARE YOU SERIOUS? At least have her changing into a pair of sneakers whenever she has the chance right?!"
" So many unrealistic human reactions/choices..
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,3,"Three stars because the acting of Chris Pratt was great (and his character is the only character who uses his brain cells), the last few scenes are good and because, well, they're dinosaurs. For the rest it really sucks and otherwise one star. And don't even get me started on (the ending of) Fallen Kingdom...They shouldn't have made the connection with the original series. Now it just seems like nobody learned anything from what happened last time. If you would state it as a new movie in another dimension, that would make more sense. Besides, who would have thought 'normal' dinosaurs would get boring so the needed to create their own creations?First, it seems that besides the dinosaurs, the reactions/choices of most actors aren't from today's world either. Countless reactions that neither you or me would ever be realistic considering the circumstances in the movie. So, the huge dinosaur, nobody knows what it consists of, escapes. Just shy of 12 people are sent to this mega-dinosaur with non-lethal weapons. Who would have thought that wouldn't work and they would die?Second, the director of the park and that woman (with the pony and bad acting) should long have been in prison for the actions leading to the death of many people. The guy creating the monsters used all the genes from different animals, but nobody thinks of that when designing the defense mechanisms (the thermal-incident)?Third, so when the two kids see a gate to a restricted area which is completely torn apart, they must have turned off their brains. What on Earth made them think 'let's go in here, we'll see some different things!' Unless you have a death wish, no human would go in there. And who would even stay in the field when you're ordered to come back to the station?! That's like staying on a vulcano when you (a) know it might erupt and (b) are ordered to get off the volcano right away. And then you're like 'Nah, I'll just keep going up'.Fourth, going back to the beginning, nobody seems to correct all of the very illogical arguments the guy who wants to make the raptors into weapons makes. Like the wolf he saved and slept in his room, which worked because he had a 'good relationship with'. Soo, you're comparing a cute little wolf to a deathly raptor?Back to the two kids, who escaped the dinosaur. They are in the restricted area, just saw the deathliest monster ever. They enter a door and thought it would be cool to look around. Again the throw-back to the old movies, but how the hell are you acting like it's just a fun walk through memory lane?!'They follow orders'. Maybe this is the most stupid sentence of the movie. In order to hunt down the big dinosaur, the military guy wants to use the reports (that they can control...) to kill the beast. He was JUST at the raptors, seeing that they are not to be controlled quickly - even Chris Pratt spent two years with them. Again, nobody seemed to think it through for a second. Do they accept orders, or do they do as told to get food because they're inprisoned - and if not in prison they would make up their own mind?So, I can name so many more things which show the lack of the ability to use brain cells to think. Like the chopper staying where it is after the dino broke into the deadly birds house (instead of getting out of there asap), the inability to evacuate the island immediately (instead of having a good, fast-working evacuation plan) or that nobody thought to tell (to Pratt or anyone else that could use that information) what the big dino is made off, even after the many deaths he already caused.So, to close of my part of the story, two minutes into the encounter of the raptors with the big dino, they learn the raptors can attack humans after all. VERY SURPRISING TWIST!One of the few interesting parts are in the very beginning when Pratt is with the raptors and at the end where Blue defends Pratt against the mega dino. And who would have thought; the sea dino is the hero in the end, eating the big modified T-Rexraptor."
" Great movie for kids
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,8,"First time I watched this movie myself, I found it pretty average. It is basically the same theme as any other jurrassic movie. Next time I watched it with my 5 year old son and it was lot more fun. He enjoyed the movie so much due to the various different types of dinasourous on display and the amazing action. I think it's the second best jurrassic movie after of course the original jurrassic park."
" Fun!
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,8,"Jurassic World is amazing. One thing happens after another thing, and there's never a time to pause once the dinosaur starts killing. The CGI is terrific throughout this whole movie and I give these actors a lot of credit. Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Nick Robinson, and Ty Simpkins are all fantastic in their roles. The score for the movie is beautiful and never feels out of place.
I honestly forgot this movie was two hours because of how well it flowed through each scene. It's definitely worth your time."
" An unnecessary return to the Jurassic Park
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,5,"When I already considered the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise extinct, director Colin Trevorrow decided to bring it back in his first major feature film, that works as a sequel to existing films and was an audacious step for him.The script is very easy to summarize and works as a sequel/reboot: the dubious legacy of John Hammond and InGen is acquired by Simon Masrani. He decides to rebuild the park, a short distance from the original facilities, renaming it Jurassic World. However, they used new dinosaurs in addition to the historical ones, created with genetic crossing. Of course, things get out of control again and everything ends up bad.The worst of this film is extreme predictability. From the beginning, we know more or less what will happen and how it will end. It's just a matter of seeing the details. There are scenes that are truly copied from the previous films, with the addition of some make-up and effects to disguise a weak story and a recipe that has worn out a lot after three films. The lack of tension and sense of danger also disappoint. Even the worst sequels of ""Jurassic Park"" had moments where we felt that the characters could die there. Here, everything is artificial and controlled, like a video game.The cast is, to say the least, irregular. I liked the performance of Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt, even though Howard appears in a character who takes a long time to gain our sympathy and who seems quite cold and disconnected from reality in the initial half. Irrfan Khan did a good job by giving life to Masrani, who looks like the mix of a utopian idealist and an unscrupulous capitalist. Less interesting, because totally empty of dramatic value, are the performances of Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson, which only exist to be in danger and to be saved, by BD Wong and Vincent D'Onofrio, the cliché of cold individuals who only care about money, and Katie McGrath, who only exists to be eaten alive!It is in the technical details and production values that we can guess how much money was actually invested in this film. The cinematography is very good, with good colors and some scenes and sequences impress by the visual beauty such as the landscapes of the new park, the scenes in the forest or even the walk between dinosaurs inside an electronic glass sphere. There are a lot of special effects and CGI involved, of very good quality. The sound effects, however, and particularly the roars, were recycled from previous films, as well as the soundtrack... but the soundtrack had to be present because it is one of the most iconic ever in cinema!In conclusion ... the film is a production that probably would be excused, as it recycles a formula that has long lost interest in the expectation of making it attractive by throwing it money. It did not work well, with the irregular cast performance and the weak script, without life or emotion, being decisive for the failure. However, it was still able to entertain. You can see it once, but it's not a movie I'd like to revisit."
" Pretty good
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,9,Jurassic World is a film that you can't miss.It's a fun film for kids.
" Very good. Worthy of being called a sequel
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,8,"Movie's title should have been: ""Dinosaur breaks out an kills stuff #4""Jurassic Park 1, 2, 3 were all very good (especially for their time), so when this movie (Jurassic Park 4) was announced after so many years, I was dubious, but Colin Trevorrow (director) did a great job.The movie has tonnes of action, same as the previous films had, and it followed almost exactly the same formula as the previous films: Stupid humans cause a dinosaur to break out and go on a kill-rampage.Chris Pratt delivers a good (albeit smug+cocky) performance, and Bryce Dallas Howard plays the workaholic love-interest well too... but for once I would just like to see the 'I'm so damn incompetent that I need a man's strong muscles to help in EVERY situation' trope NOT being used in movies that have a male+female lead.Anyway, unlike ""Jurassic World 2"" (2018), this movie is very well directed and I have very little criticism of the movie, although there are several scenes where the humans are absolute idiots, and they handle situations in very unrealistic ways which often end up getting themselves killed.Still, good movie and totally worth watching. Just avoid watching ""Jurassic World 2"" (2018) as it is significantly worse than any of the previous 4 Jurassic Park movies... Fortunately I hear that Colin Trevorrow is making a return to direct the next Jurassic Park 6 film so that is some good news... they fortunately realised their massive error in letting that other guy direct Jurassic Park 5."
" Not worth it, the whole idea and background is stupid
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,1,"The movie would have been much better if the idea behind it was different...The whole idea of making a dinosaur park out of mixing of other dino's is not what a dino park is about, you can't open a zoo where you mix half cat/half dog and call it a zoo.not to mention the idea of engineering a super killing machine, all stupid, I hated the movie but I even hate more the idea of the ""people"" (the story people) who think can do such a park.also, suppose the park administration need to have an aviary dino's variety, create 10-15 flying dino's not 200 and put them in a glass cage !!!I can't express the many ways I didn't like this movie !!!!"
" jurassic world
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,7,"Jurassic world is more modern take on this iconic 90s franchise and its modern way of filming and story and overall use of tehnology and dino hybrids were made with a dose of good quality,perhaps in this film there arent many practical effects or animatronics but still cgi was very clean and it was visually good looking and dinos were designed in a very modern but still useful way,jurassic world perhaps doesnt have heart or soul of first original film or to distant itself like lost world did but i liked this one far more then jurassic park 3,jurassic world is film that deserves to be watched at least for enterteinmant valaue,but some story plots and characters decisions may annoy you"
" NOT TERRIBLE BUT NOT AMAZING EITHER
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,5,"I really didn't like any of the characters in this movie, the two boys were annoying & Chris Pratt wasn't very good here i mean i got nothing against him but here in his role he seemed too cocky & abit of an A-hole to me!!! He's better in the remake of The Magnificent Seven & he's Awesome & hilarious in Guardians of the galaxy & the Marvel films but nothing about him is interesting at all here in his lead role!!!
Everything was obviously all over the top c.g.i but it had some good bits but the heart was missing for me & the fact that raptors could be trained & be good was abit silly but i did enjoy bits of it & i like the WEST WORLD & FUTURE WORLD & JAWS 3 style of the story that it obviously came from & yeah there is some big fun moments but bits did ruin it like the fact that the T-Rex & Raptors helped Owen & Co during the final big fight it just seemed silly to me & i didn't like the two boys in this at all both corny & bad actors like Disney brats but the Sequel is alot better for it's darker vision.
Not absolutely terrible but defence not Amazing either."
" Don't even try to watch this
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,1,I was desperately waiting for this movie to end. It has nothing to do with jurassik park and won't give you any feelings of sympathy or thrill over the entire duration. It's full of inconsistency which can't let you dive into the story.
" What a final!
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,8,"The best part of the movie is hidden in the final! I think it's not better than the first movie, Jurassic Park, but more exciting than the last one."
" Finally, a good ""Park"" sequel
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,10,"The great thing about this movie is that it has throwbacks to the original ""Jurassic Park."" The scene with the injured Triceratops in the original is now an injured Brachiosaurus. It's great that this is a remake and a sequel at the same time. The nostalgia factor is there for those who saw the original when it first came out, while at the same time keeping it fresh for a new generation. Chris Pratt doesn't disappoint with his special brand of sarcastic humor. His performance as dinosaur wrangler Owen is great. I said in my Iron Man 3 review that I hope the kid who played Harley does more acting in the future. He is in this, and he is as funny in this as he was in Iron Man 3. Some critics have complained that the story focused too much on the humans and not enough on the dinosaurs. I disagree. There was just enough teasing the dinosaurs to keep me interested even when they weren't on screen. A footprint here, a claw there, but never actually a full dinosaur until much later. And I won't spoil the finale, but its easily the best thing this franchise has ever done.
Grade: A+. 10/10. 5/5 stars"
" The magical dinosaur world is coming again

" Weak film. Franchise defiled.

The CGI in these films are horrendous and distracting. Chris Pratt as an action star is laughable. Dude's boring and overrated. Jurassic Park 3 was infinitely better than this cash grab. Save your money."
" Utter garbage, actually
",2020-03-23 00:00:00,1,Do you like ads? Watch this movie. Do you like the classic Jurassic Park movies? Don't watch this movie.
" A worthy follow up
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,8,"I think everyone had high expectations walking into this. From all the buzz it was the first great film since the first. With those highs I couldn't help but be slightly disappointed. But its aged well since. Throughout its theatrical run I found a love for the film and started looking at it on it's own terms. Besides sexy and charming Chris Pratt in the lead. Bryce Dallas Howard kicks major butt, the kids are good and the supporting cast are solid. The story is both familiar and refreshing and the FX are pretty spectacular as is the park they have created. In a sense it's sort of a reimagining of the first film and it does a solid job of doing some fun stuff with the treatment. Nothing could ever really come close to Spielberg's masterpiece in my eyes but this does a reputable job of being a solid follow up and the best since the first.Budget: $150m
Domestic Box Office: $652m
Worldwide Box Office: $1.67 billion4/5"
" Major Major Major...
",2020-03-04 00:00:00,1,"CRAP!!! Does not even deserve a 1 star! So much hype and this is what we got! Who are these jokers giving this a 10? This movie is nowhere a 7/10 movie, that's a joke!"
" Dinosaur Disaster
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,6,"The best way to watch any Jurassic Park film in my opinion is not as a sci-fi, or fantasy or adventure film but as a disaster movie: like in any disaster movie we know what the source of the catastrophe will be and the entertainment is therefore twofold; firstly how exactly will things go from ""nought to sixty"" and what exact mayhem will be unleashed!!'Jurassic World' services both these requirements perfectly well and produces an overall satisfactory disaster movie for its troubles.Adequately acted by the child actors and passably so by a mainly unchallenged adult cast the direction and editing keep the pace cranking along after first taking time establishing who's faces we are going to see contorting in fear later and in tipping us the wink as to all the possible domino effects that might unleash the impending doom!I found the references to the 'first island', and by extension the original film, to be an entirely worthwhile angle for this ""soft rebooting""/belated 3rd sequel to use.The special effects and the depictions of carnage and chaos as dinosaurs fought and killed and ate people and fought and killed and ate each other were excitingly sillified.Sillified madhouse nonsense sums up a decent disaster movie experience.I rate a 6/10 and recommend accordingly if the viewer treats this movie within its appropriate genre; but as an aside the sequel sounds terrible, not a good disaster movie concept at all, and I haven't considered watching it as a result."
" Nostalgic. Brilliant. But not complete...
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,8,"The idea of the park reopened is great. But I wanted to have a full walk in the park, enjoying all the attractions. It was so brief... The soundtrack is awesome."
" Wasted potential
",2020-02-15 00:00:00,5,This has some pretty cool ideas but does nothing with any of them it's super underwhelming
" Jurassic Park Returns
",2020-01-27 00:00:00,7,"Glad they didn't use my title. Jurassic World is full of interesting ideas and stays loyal to the very conclusion. The biggest issue is the retread of the storyline from the first film. This time they take they include a functioning park. I'm unsure if the filmmaker was the inspired choice and having one indie film under his belt, it felt uneventful. Spielberg should've returned. This was a little mixed for me and it felt like numerous ideas floating around at any given moment. This was a welcome return after the train-wreck of Jurassic Park 3. Jurassic World managed to bring series back with an interesting concept, one that was darker than expected."
" Please stop
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,5,So why was this not billed as a remake? Is there anything else we need to know about this island.
" Do you like dinos? Go watch it
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,9,"If you love dinosaurs, you should go watch this. I wont say anything else to this film"
" Don't understand the hype
",2020-01-14 00:00:00,5,"Having waited several years since this film was released to watch, and initially not being too interested in the film. Did not have high expectations. Also having not seen in the original Jurassic Park films, and not being a typical fan of dinosaur films in general.There are some decent pieces of entertainment to be held in this film but overall feels very watered down to attract a family friendly feel and audience.Not many thrills and, characters we do not really care for. Jurassic World currently has an IMDB rating of 7 and this film brought in over $1 billion dollars worldwide- of course ensuring a sequel. After watching this film, couldn't help by wonder what the hype is about. Enjoyable sure at times, but nothing too special or stood out."
" I thought it was okay
",2020-01-08 00:00:00,6,"I don't understand what was meant by ""Jurassic World"". It's a good title for a Dinosaur movie, however. I thought the movie was fine. I was actually surprised to be honest, and was expecting something far worse. It had plenty of action throughout, so it won't totally bore you. In fact, the action starts quickly fairly soon, so that goes in the movie favour. It still felt like a ""Jurassic Park"" movie, and it would've been okay to call it as ""Jurassic Park IV"" or something. It felt like a sequel of some sort, but ""Jurassic World"" is fine anyway."
" Jurassic World review
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,7,"Finally, a decent sequel to Jurassic Park. It only took 22 years. Life finds a way, I suppose.Jurassic World is directed by Colin Trevorrow and takes place 22 years after the original film, almost entirely ignoring the events of The Lost World and Jurassic Park III. This new film sees John Hammond's original vision come to life: a theme park filled with living, breathing dinosaurs has finally been made operational and open to the public. However, the general population has since grown used to seeing real dinosaurs, for whatever reason, and in order to combat diminishing returns and prevent their park from going under, bioengineers create a new hybrid dinosaur, dubbed Indominus Rex. Indominus is smarter and more cunning than they originally thought, and soon, it escapes from its confines and wreaks havoc on the entire park in typical Jurassic Park fashion.If you read my Classic Review on the original Jurassic Park film, you'll know that it was and still is a huge part of my life. I first saw it when I was very young, and it has stuck with me ever since. It's one of my favorite movies of all time, and in my humble opinion, it's nothing short of a masterpiece. While I absolutely love that film, though, I can't exactly say the same for either of the sequels. The Lost World is boring, with bland action and equally bland characters, and Jurassic Park III is just plain silly. With that in mind, I wasn't really anticipating Jurassic World all that much. There hasn't been a single good entry into the franchise since the first film, and the trailers failed to hook me. However, I couldn't stop myself from seeing it - I love the original film too much, and I'm always willing to see anything Chris Pratt is in nowadays. The end result? Not too bad.I enjoyed a lot of what Jurassic World had to offer. It's good, but isn't great. One of the best aspects of the film, without a doubt, is Chris Pratt's presence. His character, Owen Grady, is a former member of the United States Navy and has since been hired to work at Jurassic World as a velociraptor trainer. Pratt is primarily known for his comedic chops thanks for his background in Parks & Rec and last year's smash hit Guardians of the Galaxy, and I was surprised to find that they chose not to utilize Pratt for the film's comedic relief, instead turning him into a badass action hero, a choice that worked out really well. He was completely convincing in his action sequences, and I was able to take his character seriously. His relationship that he shared with his team of four raptors was perhaps the most believable relationship in the entire movie, however, which is where my first problem lies.One of the reasons why Jurassic Park is so great is because of its characters and how they are written. Each of them are unique in their own way, and they each serve a purpose for the story. I can't say the same for Jurassic World. This is a film that's been stuck in development hell for over ten years, with several different screenwriters in the midst of legal debacles trying to decide who should get writing credits for the film, and this really shows. The film's script is incredibly unfocused. There are storylines with certain characters, particularly one that follows the two main kids and their parents, that is brought up in the first act of the film and is completely abandoned halfway through. Their parents had served no purpose towards developing the film's story, and therefore had no reason to be included whatsoever, except to get their kids onto the island so they could eventually be chased by dinosaurs. Vincent D'Onofrio, who plays the film's main antagonist, is perhaps the worst of all in terms of how he is written. Not only are his motives nonsensical, but his characterization is very cliched. D'Onofrio is an otherwise talented actor, and he was wasted here. Bryce Dallas Howard was good in her role, but her character was also quite cliched - the uptight businesswoman who has to ensure that everything is running smoothly. In the end, Pratt's Owen Grady was the only one that I was able to invest in.While it might seem as though I hated the film at this point, I didn't. There was actually quite a bit that enjoyed, particularly the dinosaur action. The Indominus Rex was, for lack of a better term, just plain awesome. Her capabilities made her a formidable opponent for Pratt and his crew, and her design was unique. Any scene involving this thing were the most exciting and intense of the entire film.Without spoiling anything, there was one scene in particular during the third act involving a certain dinosaur that had me grinning ear to ear, and made me feel like a kid again. It was one of the few moments in the film where I felt as though I was actually watching a Jurassic Park movie.I also loved Michael Giacchino's score, and how well it blended with John Williams' original themes. While the film didn't capture the awe and grandeur that a Jurassic Park movie should have, the score certainly did.The Verdict: Jurassic World isn't a good Jurassic Park movie, but it's a good monster movie. While the original film treated its dinosaurs as wonders of nature, this one treated them as killing machines. If this film didn't bear the word Jurassic in the title, I'm sure I would have enjoyed it a lot more, but because Jurassic Park is such a big part of my life, it's only fair for me to compare this sequel to its predecessor. I can safely say, though, that this is by far the best of the three sequels. Beyond its cliched character archetypes and sloppy writing, I was able to find enjoyment in this film. If you're at all curious to see how this one turned out, check it out during a matinee. While it certainly doesn't recapture the magic of the first time we were taken back to the land that time forgot, it succeeds in providing some great thrills."

" A far departure from the original
",2019-11-23 00:00:00,5,"The original Jurassic Park was an intelligent debate on science vs. nature, wrapped up in an action-packed blockbuster film. This is a trope-ridden mess of bad writing, random explosions and messy combination of exposition and reveals. The characters are not likable and Owen probably is just a horrible and unredeeeming character.Overall, this is probably the worst movie in the series. It has the Jurassic Park IP name, but none of the charm or intellect that made the original a great movie."
" mediocre

Overall, the performance was OK."
" Nostalgic Masterpiece
",2019-11-09 00:00:00,10,"Honestly, Colin Trevorrow didn't fail Jurassic Park fans when creating the Jurassic World. He created a masterpiece, that contiunes right where it was left in Jurassic Park III in 2001. And including easter eggs from Jurassic Park like the old building, tshirt and the car? that gave me goosebumps!
This movie not only reminds you how beautiful the story is of restoring Dinosaur and put them in place where people can see them, but also how advanced science can be a messed up thing if you play with it too much and can create a deadly weapon if it got abused...
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if you're Jurassic Park series lover"
" How I would rewrite Jurassic world
",2019-11-08 00:00:00,1,"This was the most disappointing film of all time in my opinion. Jurassic fans like myself have waiting for the perfect fourth installment of the Jurassic franchise to come after Jurassic Park 3. And when it was announced in 2012 that the fourth installment was titled Jurassic World, we all lost our minds. And some people genuinely enjoyed this film, and viewed this as an enjoyable and a popcorn movie, and an action packed film with dinosaurs in the middle of it. In Other words, it was a fast and furious film with dinosaurs in the middle of it. While others like my self saw this as an utter disappointment to the franchise. My head was hung way too low after I saw this film. And this is this is how I would chose to rewrite the film:The story follows a fully functional park in the distant but near future, as a strange man who works for Bio Sin, Ingen's rival (Ingen is the company that runs Jurassic park and Jurassic world) shuts down all systems in the park, leaving it with no power, no electricity, complete darkness, loose dinosaurs, a completely shut down Jurassic World. This would leave quite a scary, dark, and horrific setting for the characters to face.Make this film the first rated r film of the franchise. A PG 13 film could be released alongside for kids to watch. But the real movie is rated r. Meaning full on gore and blood and violence. So decapitated heads, limbs, bloody carcase, etc. There are also some Horror elements implemented too. Many stunning horror scenes could be shot especially with the raptors. This will be the first movie where children characters in this film die.One horror scene would include an Ingen Soldier in a dark hallway, he lights a flare to see where to go. But as he walks he hears a suttle snarl or growl if you will. And as he looks around to see what's going on, he looks up slowly and and sees a velociraptor up on a vent in the ceiling. The soldier pulls out a pistol, aims for the raptor, and shoots. He misses and raptor roars and jumps on him. As the raptor claws his back, the soldier tries to crawl his way out if the hallway, and this is where the gore comes into play. As he drags himself across the floor, he leaves a trail if blood smeared across. The raptor then snaps the soldier's neck with his mouth, and feeds on his intestines.Keep the previous dinosaur designs from the previous films of the franchise. One of the most disappointing things about the whole film was its cartoony and fake dinosaur designs. The completely changed Rexy's appearance, the raptors look disgusting and outlandish, the pteranodons look like pigeons with crests, and the stegosaurs look like they got ripped from the pages of a dinosaur book in the 1960s. Rexy's design should stay true to how she looked in Jurassic Park. The Velociraptors should keep their Jurassic Park 3 designs, but change they're colours to differentiate between the Jurassic World and Jurassic Park designs, and the Male Raptors should have more feathers. The pteranodons should keep they're Lost World or Jurassic Park 3 designs, although I prefer the Jurassic Park 3 designs as they look more menacing but The Lost World designs look good too. And finally the stegos should keep The Lost World designs exactly the same unchanged.The visual effects should be delt with the same way they were delt with in the original Jurassic Park. Jurassic World had one of the most cartoony and fake CGI ever in my opinion. The original Jurassic Park that came out in 1993 had one of the most stunning CGI shots in all of cinema history. We live in an era of technology, this should not happen. This Jurassic World should be done the same way Jurassic Park was. Stan Winston animatronics and puppets for close ups, and CGI for wide shots.Characters include Owen Grady but not a raptor trainer (we are not going the military dinosaur route at all) Tim Murphay, Lex Murphay, Tim's children and Lex's children, Simon Hammond whi is John Hammond's son (John hammond created the first Jurassic Park) Ian Malcom and Ellie Satler and Alan Grabt although they won't be on Isla Nublar.The Park will include a large futuristic Visitor's Center, not like the one in Jurassic World, a pachycephalosurus fighting arena, two separate Rex enclosures, one that includes Rexy, and another that includes a feathered T-Rex, a Raptor family pen, and aviary with Pteranodons and Ramphyrincus, a carnotaurus forest, a dilophosaurus pen showcasing hunting shows of them hunting down cows and goats, Baryonix and Suchomimus River, a large herbivore valley which includes Brachiosaurus, Triceratops, Pachyrinosaurus, Parasaurolophus, Diplodocus, Iguanadon, Stegosaurs, Kentrosaurus, and many more. Other enclosures include Spinosaurs Lake, the aquarium which includes creatures like Leoplorodon, plesiosaurus, elasmosaurus, etc. Transports around the park include advanced Jeeps for the rangers, a much larger monorail, a submarine ride around the aquarium with non carnivorous creatures, and ranger car tours around the herbivore valley, and a large transport in the gallimimus herd.This is how I would rewrite Jurassic World. In my opinion this would make for a more compelling and stunning story. I believe the audience would be at the edge of their seats, and frightened when watching this."
" Terrible CGI! And dumb story!
",2019-11-01 00:00:00,3,"How is it possible that a 1993 movie has better special effects than a movie from 2015.
It looks fake and the acting is terrible, the story is super predictable. The original JP was the best and was amazing. Avoid this one by all costs!"
" I welcome reboot/continuation
",2019-11-01 00:00:00,7,"The first Jurassic park movie was epic, but the two afterwards were forgettable. Many years later, this reboot of sorts comes along and does a pretty good job getting us interested again. Some good action but some unlikable characters. Of course the dinos all look great."
" The most horrific creature ever in the Jurassic franchise....The Stilettosaurus
",2019-10-27 00:00:00,3,My rating would have been a 8 if she'd been mangled to shreds by any of the dinosaurs. or even a 9 if Chris Pratt would have pulled her high heels off and beaten her to death with them.
" A MUST WATCH !! (preferably, in IMAX 3D, if you can !!)
",2019-10-27 00:00:00,9,"Jurassic World directed by Colin Trevorrow is officially the fourth installment of the famous dino franchise that started in 1993 by the master auteur Steven Spielberg who had, in turn, adopted it from the best selling novel of sci-fi author Michael Chrichton. When Spielberg presented his pioneering movie, as an adventure 65 million years in the making, it proved to be a defining moment in movie history - an early triumph of movie magic concocted from CGI and animatronics wizardry - which redefined the possibilities and consequently, the paradigm of popular cinema. It left a firm imprint (a la T-Rex's footprint) on the minds of its viewers like me with its vivid imagery - be it the tiny ripples in the water accompanied by the thuds of the approaching creature, the chilling chase sequence of T Rex hounding a speeding jeep, the nail biter of a pantry sequence involving the two kids and a bunch of raptors as well as the sequence where kids trapped in the car are confronted by the mighty T Rex in a rampaging mode.However, as with most such mega movies, the franchise soon became a victim of its own momentous success. Dino movies, just like their dinosaurs, soon got relegated to a prehistoric era in the minds of the movie goers as subsequent summer blockbusters have continued to grow and hone their CGI wizardry to create bigger, meaner and scarier monsters which pile up the scale of mayhem with each passing year. However, the enduring value of the original movie was reinforced when Universal Studios released the reworked 3D version of Jurassic Park in 2013 to mark the twentieth anniversary of its release which proved successful across the globe.The present movie is set in Isla Nublar after 22 years from the timeline of the the first movie and ignores the story arcs of its sub-par sequels (1994 by Spielberg and 2001 by Joe Johnston). John Hammond's dream is finally a reality with his successor Mesrani (Irrfan Khan) having set up a hugely popular, luxury dino theme park called Jurassic World spanning the entire island of Isla Nublar. The park is headed by a control seeking, very formal - ""I am all business"" - park manager, Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard). Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) is an ex-navy officer-cum-animal expert, working in the park and is involved in a study on training velociraptors. As the movie opens, Claire is forced to play host to her school going nephews, Zach and Gray, who are sent by their parents for a fun weekend while they consider an impending divorce.The park itself has been a successful venture for several years now with steady growth of visitors from across the world. The influx of the visitors is spiked periodically by introducing a new species every few years to sustain the waning interests. The tourists' fatigue of older attractions is succinctly captured in a sequence where Zach, in his observatory, prefers to remain glued to his smart phone and ignores a T-Rex (no less), quite literally, devouring a scapegoat (a key element in the first movie). So, when mother nature is incapable of dishing out attractions that could sustain such volatile attention spans, the corporation running Jurassic World decides to take matters in its own hands to bolster the sagging growth curve of footfalls in the park. They cook up a new dino attraction - read bigger, louder, smarter dinosaur with more teeth - called Indominus rex, by concocting a genetic cocktail of DNA sourced from multiple dinosaurs and other species. Predictably, as dictated by the template of such genre movies, the dino escapes its confinement to go on a killing frenzy, unleashing mayhem on the unsuspecting tourists as well as other dinosaurs.
Off the cast, Chris Pratt (Guardians of the Galaxy) continues to charm with his performance and one gets a feeling that he might well be the right guy for an Indiana Jones reboot. He shares an interesting chemistry with Howard who is competent and brings in the necessary intensity in the second half. The rest of the cast including Irrfan and the two kids are merely for functional aspects - to stage an action sequence, mouth something vaguely philosophical or become feast for the predators - with limited scope to perform as is the norm in such monster movies.Director Colin Trevorrow who had impressed with his indie time travel comedy, Safety Not Guaranteed, on his debut, is filling some VERY BIG shoes for his second feature and has managed to ace his first try at the summer blockbuster genre. Trevorrow's execution manifests his brilliance in marshaling the resources at hand to craft a sure-fire winner that packs in the right dose of spectacle to shock and awe the viewers. He stages the action sequences with commendable clarity and fluid camera work which herald him as a maker who is confident of his craft and can leave his mark despite several imprints of Spielberg (Executive Producer here) that permeate the movie. Trevorrow also doffs his hat at Spielberg's original as well as earlier works more than once as in the case of using Mr. DNA animation, statue of Hammond, using the dilapidated site of the earlier park to stage an action sequence or even in the spectacular sequence of feeding a great white shark to an aquatic dinosaur (Mosasaurus).Besides being the big bang blockbuster, Trevorrow and his co-writers supplement the regular fare of faulting human hubris in playing God to include multiple elements of self-referencing all through the movie by flagging the never-ending saga of our times - the interplay of consumerism and capitalism wherein we, the consumers (even as audiences) are constantly seeking the next BIGGER, BETTER experience and the capitalists seeking to continuously stoke this innate, insatiable instincts of the consumer and milk the same for more and more moolah.On the flip side, the movie could be definitely held guilty for doing such self referencing a tad too much as well as for playing up the ancient gender archetypes, multitude of conspicuous product placements and some pretty hollow characterisations. Yet, it redeems itself by delivering solidly on its promise of bringing the scares through BIGGER, LOUDER & MORE TEETH which translates into popcorn munching fun, fear and wonderment. While clearly not surpassing Spielberg's original, Trevorrow's energetic movie is mighty successful in replicating much of the awe and is clearly a worthy successor that ups the benchmark of spectacle value for future movies which could well make it the biggest winner of this summer."
" Pretty close to plain dumb
",2019-10-11 00:00:00,2,Jurassic Park has tension. Once the story was established it was like a runaway train. And the two adults and two kids in that movie just held on. It was breathtaking.Jurassic World has zero tension. Care factor for the characters is minimal. Things happen onscreen and you simply don't feel anything.And if you can't feel for who's on screen then it becomes a bore.And then there's someone running through the jungle in high heels...Go watch the first movie and leave it at that.
" Very bad sequel
",2019-09-07 00:00:00,1,"Inventing new dinosaurs is a total non sense to me, this kind of film is made to see what those dinos really looked like, not creating some new monsters to show off and make it scarier. I must add that the final battle was poorly filmed with a lot of slow motions, not enjoyable at all."
" Popcorn flick, nothing more.
",2019-09-07 00:00:00,7,"I'm going to keep this brief.The movie was practically entertaining, the CGI was masterful but it was annoyingly flawed at times for the sake of plot convenience. The writers and director thought ""Lets make Jurassic World, we have the technology that Spielberg dreamed of"" and what we get is a similar plot to Jurassic Park with a few tweaks and modernisation but it's not enough as the movie is already too much up it's own a** with eye candy visuals and cheesy dialog at it's fingertips. Welcome to modern cinema of cash grabbing one on one.7/10"
" My Review!
",2019-08-29 00:00:00,9,"This is a perfect example of an action adventure movie. Much better than it's predecessors. A new story, fresh out of the box in it's series. You might not feel the complete effect of the movie if not watched in theatre. This is a great watch for both Jurassic Park series followers and first timers. I'm definitely watching this again.P.S: Those who cannot handle few scary bloody scenes, pl. do not go for it. Noticed at least a few with kids leaving the movie half way.Peace Out!"
" What is this foolishness??
",2019-08-18 00:00:00,1,"The acting is BEYOND terrible. I had a good laugh through the whole thing, but not for any good reasons. It felt like a bunch of random scenes put together to make this film, nothing really connects. Chris Pratt is a good actor, but he should have passed on this."
" Total bullcrap, really
",2019-08-10 00:00:00,1,"I really did the best I could, but I had a hard time not falling asleep or getting bored to death during this film. Truly a total waste of time and money."
" The new generation will be just as thrilled and enraptured as original fans
",2019-08-07 00:00:00,9,"The horrifying events on Isla Nebula have been forgotten and Jurassic Park has reopened as Jurassic World. But the public's waning interest sees the park's scientists (still headed up by BD Wong!) go to questionable lengths to keep them entertained - a genetically modified hybrid dinosaur bigger and more deadly than anything the park has handled before.It's hard to believe this is the director's second only feature length film and you can see why Steven Spielberg selected him personally. It's as though you're on a theme park ride for the full two hours, which goes by in a flash of teeth, technology and rain soaked forages through the undergrowth.Chris Pratt is intensely likeable as the rebooted Sam Neill of the piece, connecting audiences to the new story's backbone, the struggle to help the paying public (and the park's investors) understand that these once mythological creatures, now relegated to ordinary zoo attractions, are real animals in need of proper care and capable of heinous acts if they don't receive that care.Jurassic World is a 21st century big budget family action film to rival the best.
The new generation will be just as thrilled and enraptured as original fans were more than 20 years ago and us originals will appreciate the return of John Williams' theme and the raptors as the stars of the show."
" Best yet (probably)
",2019-08-05 00:00:00,8,"As good an update to a semi-dated classic as anyone could ask for.With humour, the sense of adventure and danger expertly applied, the movie sends its own franchise up a little bit and is charming in that respect.Of course it's visually stunning. You might say it's derivative and unoriginal but so is everything Spielberg's ever been attached to. I gave it 8/10 what more do you want?Oh, and I love that workaholic character who rises to the occasion in when things get pear shaped."
" Jurassic World
",2019-07-20 00:00:00,9,"9/10 - fun reboot to a classic, while similarities are overabundant, the special effects have progressed tremendously making this well worth while"
" Incredible reboot
",2019-07-12 00:00:00,9,"Jurassic World is an incredible reboot. Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard and Vincent D'Onofrio all give great performances. It's well paced with fantastic CG. Michael Giacchino's score is also great. Colin Trevorrow's direction is really good and it's well filmed. The third act has an incredible dinosaur fight. However, it sometimes relies on characters making dumb decisions."
" DO YOU REMEMBER JURASSIC PARK!!!???
",2019-07-09 00:00:00,3,"Jurassic Park is a movie classic. Period. Yes, the sequels were never even close to the level, but at least they were entertaining. We can't say the same about Jurassic World.
It's obvious that this is just a cash-grab aimed at nostalgic fans. Forget about the interesting characters, incredible effects, and compelling story of the original... surprise, this is the opposite.
We couldn't care less about our protagonists, they're poorly written and mediocre performances don't help.
The script is so stupid that it's funny what happens on screen, at least you can laugh about it.
The effects are uninteresting, they don't help the action scenes at all, they're really tedious.
Really bad sequel, just go and see the originalOh, I almost forget about the high heels...that's comedy gold."
" Jurassic returns to its glory
",2019-07-03 00:00:00,9,"This movie is what you should expect for a summer movie, the plot is ok, but not good, it has some flaws, but if you're a dinosaur fan you will enjoy the movie form the beginning to the end.
A good point is the introduction of a hybrid dinosaur, this adds something new to the franchise."
" Welcome to Jurassic World
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,10,"Jurassic World is one the best dinosaur of the year, and it's the #1 Movie in the World. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are fantastic. It's Intense, Thrilling, Fun, A Masterpiece, it's a new world of life, and life will always find a way, around the World."
" entertaining
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,8,"Super zalama. intense and entertaining throughout. i loved how much more they were able to do with better technology and endless funds. the dinosaurs looked awesome and a lot more detailed, with a lot more species and variations of each. great job exploring more possibilities of where this idea could be taken. lots of great unique memorable scenes done creatively. good cast. lots of funny parts but some jokes that flopped.on 4th viewing, this movie is still entertaining but feels more throw-away than i originally felt. i thought about dropping to a 7. (about 4 viewings, 2/4/2021)
SPOILERS
not all characters were deep, but one that surprisingly was, was the indominus rex. it had a great psychological aspect to it. also with the Raptors whether they would be loyal to their species or their friends, like the nature vs nurture argument. the final battle was absolutely phenomenal and amazingly directed. And the last scene with the t-rex screaming gave me goosebumps, signifying it was the king, at the top of the food chain"
" Completely empty movie.
",2019-06-24 00:00:00,4,"So many thing where bad about this movie, such a simple plot, no depth in the characters, poor acting, unexplained plot turns and characters, silly gender biases (girl runs in the jungle in high heals and the man holds the gun) and not even that exciting despite a huge dinosaurs is chasing them.
Can't believe I saw the whole thing."
" Blockbuster ending
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,9,"Im an avid fan of Jurassic Park and was so excited for this sequel. It didn't disappoint either, I feel they played safe with a similar style to the original classic which was fine by me cause it did enough differently for it to be appreciated. Rather than match the suspense of the original it when gung ho on action and effects with a huge screen time for dinosaurs which is what we all came to watch. It was a little corny here and there but i think it saved itself with playing on that a couple times to not take itself too seriously. I loved how they incorporated the original into the story too and thought the ending was breathtakingly good. Good show from the actors, especially Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, the child actors where a weak link but overall this is a fantastic blockbuster movie."
" Just a monster movie
",2019-06-14 00:00:00,7,It's an entertaining monster movie with amazing special affects and that's all the compliments someone can give this movie of the four protagonist only one of them goes through a character ark the others are just cool special forces guy and 2 kids that only exist to be scared by the dinosaurs and the main villain is just a stereotypical evil military guy that wants to make weapons out of raptors and a prototype t-Rex
" Thank God For Chris Pratt
",2019-06-13 00:00:00,4,"Ron Howard's daughter needs to stay out of Hollywood. No chemistry, in fact, no acting skills. Thank you Happy Days, the dinosaurs are better actors"
" AMAZING MOVIE... if you're 10 years old.
",2019-06-04 00:00:00,4,"This is clearly a kids movie. It's boring, predictable, by-the-book characters (like the villains are always SO OBVIOUS and so by-the-book it's boring), obvious plot, uninteresting subplots and, of course, CGI dinosaurs. And not that many as you might expect... These movies have nothing new to offer, I'm amazed how this got a 7 on IMDB. Too many ten year olds rating this movie I guess..."
" WE NEED MORE TEETH
",2019-05-12 00:00:00,7,"Owen (Chris Pratt) is ex-navy and works with raptors, eat your heart out Siegfried and Roy. Vincent D'Onofrio plays the human antagonist like Brian Dennehy and has a plan to adapt dinosaurs to military use. Bryce Dallas Howard provides our hero with a love interest because all the best films are love stories. You get the picture, dinosaurs running, flying, and swimming around killing each other and eating grandma who still has a few good years. In the beginning they hint that the audience wants action with bigger and badder dinosaurs, so they do that and sacrifice any aspect of building or creating memorable characters. I would have been happy just to see Jeff Goldblum, as an extra, getting eaten by a dinosaur.The dinosaurs aren't any better than they were 20 years ago. The characters were bland. The film had a loose plot and I kept waiting for it to engage me. The kids weren't even as cute as the first film. Oh Yeah. Chris Pratt runs with dinosaurs, which is apparently a big deal.Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Minor swearing such as SOB."
" Visually Good But Plot & Characters Suck
",2019-05-12 00:00:00,5,This movie aggravated me. Not because of its visuals which were pretty good but the plot & characters destroyed this movie. I was not invested & didn't care about the characters. That's not a good thing! Also the action scenes you would think would've blew my mind really didn't. It seemed generic even though visually everything looked real. It's a wasted potential that dragged many audiences to want to love this movie but instead get an average movie overall. 5/10 is my rating. (Average)
" ... of hurt
",2019-05-03 00:00:00,3,"I would consider myself a fan of the Jurassic series, but wow, this was boring, even with the non-stop action. I could SEE it trying to involve me, the viewer, but the story was such crap I couldn't do it. The special effects were good, but the story was not. Pass on this one."
" A Jurassic Park raised to the second power
",2019-05-03 00:00:00,10,Jurassic World is Jurassic Park raised to the second power. A masterful Dinosaurs movie with a powerful anti-corporate greed and anti-militaristic message.
" Average
",2019-04-28 00:00:00,6,"If you're looking for a movie: with bad actors, no humour, too long, politically correct, with great special effects, hairdos that never move whatever happens, happy ending and interesting to 7yo this is the movie for you."
" Good flick. Poor choice of actresses.
",2019-04-08 00:00:00,7,If dad is a director I suppose you get a starring role without having talent or any appeal. Pratt is funny and a strong presence.
" The franchise has had a lobotomy
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,4,"Dinosaurs. Amusement Park. Tourists. Disaster.Jurassic World has them all.Naturally, I had to see it.The beginning holds much promise, and it gets your hopes up for the disaster to come. When it does, there are some great action sequences, especially ones with the glass ball containing the soft, chewy child centre.Unfortunately the final act unravels into outright farce.Chris Pratt is great as the affable yet bad-ass Raptor Whisperer. He's got an easy going charisma that could easily carry an iconic character like Indiana Jones.Bryce Dallas Howard plays Claire Dearing, the uptight park manager, who initially clashes with the laid back Owen. Of course you know where the tension goes.The film tries to flesh out Claire's character by throwing in her two nephews (someone and another kid), who do double duty as McGuffins.Vincent D'Onofrio shows up as Hoskins, a villainous representative of the military-industrial complex angling to weaponize velociraptors. He's all sneers and scenery chewing, so obviously evil he's got a goatee. D'Onofrio does it well but the evil plan he's been saddled with by the writers makes no sense at all.The director, Colin Trevorrow, said in interviews that he wanted the dinosaurs to act like real animals, not cartoon monsters. Quelle surprise! I had no idea, as he has well-fed winged dinos (or near enough to dinos) go on a crazed orgy of violence against hapless tourists. Why? Because cool action sequence!One poor soul is even treated to the most outlandishly elongated death sequence I've ever seen, all to no end. It didn't justify anything, paid nothing back, offered no comeuppance. It was just gleeful indulgence in sadistic torture of a minor character. It was an Itchy & Scratchy moment.Which brings us to the final act: turn off your brain before it begins.The first movie proved you could have a smart script and dinosaurs in the same movie. After that, the IQ of the series dropped with each outing. The first one had chaos theory and amber and DNA extraction and cleverness up the whazoo. It was AWESOME.What does this one have? Hackneyed evil plans, a clunky plot, and characters so smart they run from T-Rex's in high heels.The franchise has had a lobotomy."
" Not surprised
",2019-03-17 00:00:00,6,Classic storyline in the movie. I like the visuals. It was also smart to include some Alfa beta game inside of the story.
" A reboot sequel that is nothing if entertaining.
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,7,"What happens when you genetically splice together a reboot and a sequel? This film. It's interesting to find a franchise that's willing to recognize the past material and build upon it, while also adding slightly new elements to it. The idea of training dinosaurs just like pets was undoubtedly the strongest element of this movie, even if the result was the same as it's ever been. Part of the problem with this reboot, however, is that the characters don't seem to click, even to the point of the relationships feeling forced.While there were plentiful nods to the first film that started off the franchise, the plot seemed almost identical to the 1993 classic, but with plenty of cliches and hokey lines to go around. I think sequels like this recognize the elements that made the original great, but almost spend too much time overanalyzing to try and recreate the magic. These films ultimately fall short, mostly due to the synergy and sheer luck that made all the elements of the first movie work in the first place.All that being said, it was an exciting thrill ride with a bunch of ridiculous dinosaur battles: essentially what you paid for anyway. I mean, the first film in this franchise worked because of the terror that goes with being trapped on an island full of dangerous dinosaurs. This film dispenses these scary moments, but in a way that just seems like a Hollywood action blockbuster (which if we're honest, it is). It was nice to see the franchise try to return to its roots, but I also think we should have let this franchise go extinct with only the original as its hallmark achievement.A reboot sequel that is nothing if entertaining, I give Jurassic World 3.5 stars out of 5."
" Meh?
",2019-02-28 00:00:00,6,"Colin Terverrow's, 'Jurassic World' is a wasted opportunity. By all means the film isn't bad, just okay. The story feels like a retread of the first 3 movies, and hardly anything original is done in this flick. The acting is very good and the characters are extremely likable which Trevorrow is very good at, creating likable characters. Christ Pratt is a modern day Indiana Jones in this flick, he is very good and very fun. Bryce Dallas Howard is a lot of fun as well. The newcomer children actors are watchable until the 'divorce' subplot is introduced randomly. The music is excellent by Michael Giacchino, the new John Williams. The dinosaurs are fun for the first half when they are just being shown off, but become nonsensical in the films final battle. Far too many references to the original Jurassic Park, great acting, an annoying divorce subplot and a pointless military subplot, fun humor, nice visuals, a lackluster story. The die hard Jurassic Park fans will praise it, but the average movie goer can still have fun with this one. I do recommend this one"
" This movie is a perfect distraction
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,8,"These film really liven up my day. The action, the movements, the history. The whole plot made me crawl."
" It can only be said that the rules are moderate
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,7,"It can only be said that the rules are moderate. The special effects were basically in line with expectations, and the last two Tyrannosaurus Rex had a much worse battle. The plot, as always, is a collection of no Zuo no die. Of course, there will be a lot of loopholes. The space reserved for the sequel looks small. Finally, Tucao only receives 20 thousand of the parks, and is not afraid of Chinese tourists."
" Mostly a Family movie, has about 2-3 good scenes
",2019-02-08 00:00:00,5,"No interesting character development, I do not care who dies in this movie.
Most of the dinosaur CGI didn't impress me too much, looks too polished and not realistic.
The writing of this movie was made, so parents can watch this with their kids who see a dinosaur on a movie banner and want to watch it really badly.
This is mostly a bad movie and has about 2-3 good scenes."
" An Excellent Soft Reboot
",2019-02-04 00:00:00,8,"This movie succeeds at being a faithful soft reboot as well as sequel for the Jurassic Park franchise. A few poor writing elements are present, but for the most part it's good dinosaur fun and even meta and thought provoking at times. I highly recommend it if you're interested."
" An ok reboot
",2019-02-01 00:00:00,6,This movie was ok. Never even came close to beating the original movie and the ending really frustrated me that there was now a T. rex roaming free on the island and no one was bothered
" amazing film
",2019-01-31 00:00:00,10,"Jurassic world the fallen kingdom is a wonderful dinosaur movie ever! After the isla nublar stricken by a volcanic eruption. the remaining dinosaur species were brought to a large Lockwood plantation, in America. At that place, Owen and Claire realized that the dinosaur species was auctioned and not preserved. A very dangerous hybrid dinosaur known as the Indoraptor, fled and began terrorizing residents around the plantation.
I think the sound effect and the animation of the dinosaur are good."
" Yet another flawed but entertaining waste of time.
",2019-01-29 00:00:00,5,"As much as the movie wants to be the next Jurassic park, it just ends up being the next ""Jurassic park 3"", in the sense that it is just another fun and idiotic dinosaur movie that just happens to be a sequel to one of Steven Spielberg's masterpieces. The movie has a ton of plot holes illogical moments, very few interesting characters and CGI effects that are full of imagination, but are lacking the realism of the original. In conclusion, this new installment in the blockbuster franchise might not be a mind-blowing piece of work, but it has enough mindlessly entertaining moments to keep it fun."
" Derivative But OK
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,7,"16 June 2015. This movie seems to be a fusion of a monster disaster movie, typical of King Kong (2005) that has the beautiful, helpless lady sprawled on the ground with her skirt hiked up. The creation of the new dinosaur and the questions it raises might the singular most intellectually intriguing for this mostly predictable, mind-numbing and questionable logically flawed movie. There are so many scenes that just seem to be connected with so many coincidences as simply a lazy script device to keep the pacing and excitement going regardless. The visuals are decent for now and will eventually be improved upon in the future. The sound effects effective. There are number of relational and character moments of merit but mostly underdeveloped or never fully developed. Irrfan Khan's character had the most stimulating and interesting character (the new tycoon owner) that was never truly met the exciting character that he would have been developed into. I was waiting for the older boy's interest in attractive girls to be developed into more balance gender movie.I was more impressed by the subtle but stimulating mental themes of the Disney-like contrast of a thrilling futurist community of Tomorrowland (2015) or the gene splicing creation of Splice (2009) or the action thrills of Aliens (1986) or Predator (1987). In a number of ways the animated sci fi movie Wall*e (2008) possessed more mental and artistic impact than Jurassic World using silence for much of the instead of exciting, explosive action, a much more difficult directorial feat. Even classic sci fi movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) had a much more captivating and magically engrossing visual and mysterious them without all the overly graphic bombardment for the testosterone deprived audience. Without the dry wit of Jeff Goldblum's contributions in the original movies, the overall Jurassic World looses a lot of its charm in the face of so much violence and perhaps unnecessary devastation."
" An Entertaining, But Unnecessary Nostalgia Trip
",2019-01-11 00:00:00,5,"Jurassic World is the fourth installment (you can say second considering it actively ignores the previous two sequels) in the Jurassic Park franchise which is one of my favorite franchises. I like all the installments for various reasons, film or literary, no matter how bad some can get. The first film is one of my favorite movies period. The Lost World, while inferior to the first film definitely, is still a worthy sequel and I feel is a very underrated film. I'm also a fan of the books by Michael Crichton of which the first two movies are based on. Jurassic Park 3, while certainly not a good movie like its predecessors, I can enjoy as an entertaining monster movie.I wasn't expecting too much going into this film. I knew it wouldn't be as good as the first film or even the second one. I was only expecting it to be an entertaining monster movie like the third film and that's exactly what got.The story is very simple. Twenty years after when the first film took place the park is officially opened (had been for years) and tourists are flocking to it by the truck loads. However, people had become desensitized and bored by regular dinosaurs so the owners and scientists in their infinite wisdom decided to create a genetically modified hybrid to up the wow factor. However, the hybrid escapes and starts wreaking havoc around the park and freeing other dinosaurs from their containers and everything goes awry.The film does have a few things going for it. It is quite entertaining as a straight forward monster movie and it did give me feelings of nostalgia. I like it mainly for the same reasons I like Jurassic Park 3 in that it's a fun monster movie.I also like that it tries to do something different with actually having the park up and running along with the incorporation of the dinosaur hybrid which is a cool monster with a nice design. Easily my favorite thing about this film is the Indominus Rex. It's a cool design, and it was enjoyable watching it work. The park itself also looks very nice and it was cool to actually see the park actually functioning.Chris Pratt also does a good job as the lead and I liked his character. I was worried from the trailers of him being a raptor whisperer. However, I think they handle it fairly well. It further establishes that these dinosaurs are not monsters (besides the new hybrid) but animals as the first two films made clear. I also like that they establish he's not in full control and the relationship has to be constantly tested. He's like a lion tamer.However, that's where the praise ends. Firstly, the CGI is horrible. It's been over twenty years since the first film yet the effects are easily the worst out of all the films. JP 3 had better effects than this. The effects for these films should be getting better not worse. The dinosaurs all look so incredibly fake it's not even funny. All the other films used animatronics along with the CG but this it's obviously 100% CG. If they did use animatronics then they definitely used CG over them.Also, the cast is subpar. Chris Pratt's character is good but he's the only one in my opinion. All the other character I was not invested in at all. Granted there was no character I adamantly disliked but no one I really cared for either besides Chris Pratt. The villain is also very one-note but, thankfully, he doesn't play a major role.Not to mention there are so many nods and even scenes reenacted from the first film it's ridiculous. I know this is the first film from this franchise in a long time and some nods are fine but there were so many of the same beats being hit it got a bit annoying. The final battle especially felt a lot like the final battle from Jurassic park with the raptors.Overall, Jurassic World is not a worthy sequel to the first two movies. I'd say it's on par with JP 3. In fact, I like JP 3 a bit more because of my nostalgia for it. However, if you're a fan of Jurassic Park then there's no reason not to see this."

",2018-12-25 00:00:00,2,"I persevered with the film as much as I could and I liked the special effects, but was consistently annoyed with the damn ""shaky cam"" when ever there is an action sequence. Kind of spoils it when you can't see what's going on... Or get dizzy trying."
" Jurrasic World
",2018-12-06 00:00:00,6,"Well though it was a hectic film with unprecedented visual effects the film lacks to grasp the originality of the ""Jurrasic Park"". What I want to point out is that the contribution made from the original film to the industry is not there in this film. The excessive visual effects is quite the same ""trump"" card the new blockbuster films have always been playing without new innovative approaches for films. Comparatively ""Mad Max : Fury Road"" is one of the best films I have watched with both Blockbuster and Classic fusion. We'll talk about this later with the ""worthy"" films.Overall this film had so much potential and opportunity to make a blast in the industry but missed it. And kinda ruined a childhood favourite franchise."
" Popcorn Fun

" Doesn't quite reach the heights of the original
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,8,"It's about time they finally made a sequel to Jurassic Park! Jurassic World is a logical and acceptable continuation of the story that started over 20 years ago. However, even though there are plenty of sweaty-palm moments, it doesn't quite reach the heights of the original. Some of the storylines seem forced, and the dinosaur effects aren't any better than they were in 1993. Nevertheless, I'm glad they finally made a sequel to Jurassic Park. Yes, it would have been foolish of them to make any sort of ridiculous sequels with gymnastics or talking raptors."

",2018-11-21 00:00:00,8,In my opinion this film is a great revival of the Jurassic Park series. It is also action packed and funny at times when it needs to be funny. Overall I'd say if your a fan of the Jurassic Park films this is definitely a must watch.
" an updated sequel to Jurassic Park
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,2,Review: I was disappointed with this movie because I expected a hell of a lot more from a Jurassic park based movie. The direction and screenplay are both sub-par. The casting and acting wasn't bad. Chris Pratt gave a stand alone good performance as an adult version of Owen the little boy from the original Jurassic park. All in all I would give this two out of a possible five stars.
" After 22 years...
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,7,"""Jurassic World"" is an Action - Adventure movie which starts a new era of Jurassic Park film series. After 22 years of the opening of the original Jurassic Park, a new park opens with much more potential than the first and since technology is at a higher level than it used to be before 22 years, bigger, louder and more scary dinosaurs are going to be created. This will have as a result a creation of a dinosaur which is the strongest of them all and is genetically modified from the scientists of the park in order to be able to survive and kill everything.I liked this movie because it had been a lot of time since a dinosaur movie released and it was actually good. It had an interesting plot with some modifications or differences from the original movie of Jurassic Park but the main core of the plot remained the same. I believe that it was a good idea because the director kept the original plot to its core and he built on it his new ideas for this movie and that's why I think Colin Trevorrow did a good job in the direction of this movie. I have to admit that I also liked the interpretation of Chris Pratt who played as Owen and Bryce Dallas Howard who played as Claire. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned are Irrfan Khan's who played as Masrani and he was also very good because he gave a different touch in some scenes which I believe made the difference and BD Wong's who played as Dr. Henry Wu and he gave the speech of the movie.Finally, I have to say that ""Jurassic World"" is a nice movie, it has great interpretations and a well-written script that will draw your attention and I am sure that you are going to like it very much. I believe that everyone has to watch it and if you are a dinosaur fan let me say that is a must movie to watch."
" It's a 1* movie because you can't give a - * rating.
",2018-11-12 00:00:00,1,What an absolute shambles that was. After 20 minutes I was bored to tears and despite watching the full movie I found it was only to get even worse. How the studio justified a sequel Is beyond me. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Avoid at all costs.
" Hollywood at its best
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,8,"In the fourth installment in the science-fiction Jurassic Park series: a tourist dinosaur park runs into trouble when a genetically modified creature breaks out of her confined area.This is one of those big-budget Hollywood blockbusters that's really worth seeing. The set design of the park is breathtaking as are the special effects. Director Colin Trevorrow has done a great job with mega-crowd scenes and multiple thrills.The buildup to the action/adventure is also surprisingly fascinating. The story takes a shot against the radical bigger-is-better greed and its corresponding interference with nature: something that is rampant in our modern corporate world. (This is ironic as the movie is coming from one of the biggest forms of this mindset: big-budget Hollywood movie-making.)Once the action takes place, this theme disappointingly dissipates. While character development almost always takes the back seat in such movies, there could have at least been a confrontation against one of the characters (or even the showing of remorse) on the trouble she helped create. In addition, some of the performances are also disappointing.However, ""Jurassic World"" is big-budget Hollywood at its best. Overall, it sets out to entertain and it does so quite well.RATING: * * *OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS: Special Effects, Set Design"
" Excellent!
",2018-11-04 00:00:00,10,"Of course it isn't powerful like the first one, but a super great movie."
" Wow
",2018-09-30 00:00:00,10,"Wow. This is one of the few reboots that I have seen and actually loved! The storyline was original and the casting was perfect. Chris Pratt ;) I was around for the original JP, which is a classic. This one is right up there. I have watched it multiple times and still enjoy it. There were a few parts where I muttered under my breath ""yeah, right. Not possible"" lol the whole Jeep part was a wee bit unrealistic - you know what I'm talking about. But minor annoyance. Overall, love"
" Something Hasn't survived
",2018-09-26 00:00:00,7,Okay yes alot of people will disagree with me but i didnt really like this movie. Yes its an okay movie if you see it on a movie theater screen but beside that its not really tense if you dont watch it in theaters.
" Welcome to Jurassic World
",2018-09-24 00:00:00,9,"Forget some of the bad reviews this movie has received. They are not justified.The first of a new trilogy of films, Jurassic World brings us back full circle to the original film. Back to where it started.The movie is obviously having a go at corporate greed with the park now fully opened and a genetic hybrid dinosaur designed to lure in more visitors.The movie is a thrilling yet familiar ride back through the park. We meet new people and see new dinosaurs that we never saw in the original trilogy.The movie has the same sense of humour that the original movies had. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are the main stars, and they have amazing chemistry together.Full of action and suspense the movie is a fantastic thrill ride from start to finish. And as usual with this series, the visual effects are always top notch.So sit right back and enjoy the dinosaurs creating new havoc on the island"
" If you're into
",2018-09-22 00:00:00,2,"Graphics and don' t really care about logic, go see it - you'll love it.
If not, just don't.. ignore. I tried to like it, I honestly did. Yet, the story has so many holes and it turns out into such a cliche, that has been seen for so many times now.
To cut a long story short - if you like killing time, go see it.
If you appreciate your time, never watch this freaking movie"
" Lacking Substance
",2018-09-17 00:00:00,6,"This franchise needs to die. When the first film came out, so many years ago, it was utterly groundbreaking in so many ways. The special effects, of course, were a milestone and a high watermark at the time. But it wasn't just that... there were good performances from the actors, and the script they were working with was itself innovative. Michael Crichton's book was itself pushing the edge. There was a lot there--meaty explorations of chaos theory, the relationship of human-kind and nature, of technology's role in evolution, and so many interesting questions. The dinosaurs were there to invoke the awe of unbounded natural force and of life.Now the dinosaurs aren't even dinosaurs. They are engineered monsters in what devolves into a simplistic creature feature. The Lost World at least had some merits in concept, though flawed in execution. But ever since JP3, it seems like they've embraced mediocrity on the precept that visual effects will get people to watch and carry the film. They may be right about the first part, but not so much the later.As much as I LOVED seeing a liopleurodon on screen in all its glory, by the time the film got to its conclusion I was burnt out. The final scene was underwhelming because of, not in spite of, its gratuity and it's following in a long line of other gratuities. Gone was the moment when slow tension would build before we could then bask in the exhilaration of finally seeing a T-Rex break free of its cage and thunder past our characters. A thunderstorm is awesome because of the unpredictable flashes of lightning. This film is just a bright light shining into your face non stop. Maybe someday they'll start refocusing on the lore, in the same way Rogue One did for Star Wars. Smaller stories that add to building the world, and where the big stuff is there, but situated to support, not drive, the story."
" Let the franchise go extinct already.
",2018-09-07 00:00:00,6,"While some may give it a quick 10 stars (bots?), other say it kept them at the edge of their seat. I could only wish. 
After about an hour and a half of the same ol', I turned it off and watched the rest the next day. 
Not really sure where this was all going, don't really care. 
If anything it showcased how greed and genetic manipulation can destroy the planet. Never mind the recycled plots and music."
" Best movie ever
",2018-08-31 00:00:00,10,I think that all of you haters are damn wrong cause this was a very good movie and I recommend it but the amount of hate this movie gets surprises me cause me and my family thought it was really cool
" Typically predictable
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,5,"Although the action, dinosaurs and actors are shot well this level of predictability and a deeply suspect plotline that seems seninimous with Spielberg, it breeds contempt and disbelief. OK, but in the end disattisfying."
" Loved This
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,10,Having never seen any of the Jurassic Park movies I thought I would take a change with Jurassic World and I am so glad I did as I loved this movie. I love that the film was already set up so that the action could take way near the film and had the chance of seeing how it would expand thorughout the park and how the dinosaur was created. A brilliant film which I am glad I watched
" Awful
",2018-08-13 00:00:00,2,None of the charm of the classic. Just a CGI bore fest
" Same island, new faces
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,6,"I have nothing bad to say about ""Jurassic World""; for all intents and purposes, this is a decent Summer blockbuster that'll hold your attention throughout. At least, it did for me, and I was watching it on the small screen. But I guess I have nothing great to say about it either? Almost none of the characters are memorable (think ""The Lost World""), which allows Chris Pratt to easily steal the movie. So if he's your thing, then settle in. But look, Jurassic Park hasn't been great since the first one, and this movie rides that nostalgia to the very end. I guess that makes sense if you're going to reboot this series, but it doesn't leave you with much after the movie's over."
" Jurassic World
",2018-08-09 00:00:00,7,"There are baad loose ends at the end. For one of them, why is Aunt Claire all fine when it was largely her fault that so many people died? Entertaining overall, but definite has some plot holes and nonsensical acting at times."
" An Awesome Jurassic Park movie!
",2018-08-09 00:00:00,8,"That movie is one of the best of all time. I've seen a lot of non dramatic science fiction action in this movie and two of the best characters are Owen and Blue. As for the two boy, who were having fun in the amusement park, they were also having fun riding an old jeep. The park shouldn't have created the Indominus Rex, otherwise it'll cause the people to panic around the park and cause a lot of chaos. One of the best parts is when Pterodactyl grabs the woman and puts her in the water, the boys meet Owen(the raptor trainer), and when the T. Rex and Blue fight against that Indominus. I say this movie is funnier and better than it's sequel."
" An amazing new twist to one of my favorite franchises.
",2018-08-08 00:00:00,10,"The newer addition to the Jurassic Park franchise(not including Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom) brings a whole new twist to the Jurassic Park world, genetic hybrid dinosaurs, which in my opinion is amazing. The new addition Indominus Rex looks really cool, and really terrifying, also to add to the coolness of this move Chris Pratt comes along, with his team of trained raptors, which is really cool too. Of course things go awry AND DINOSAURS RUN AMOK which is what makes these movies what they are. As a fan of all Jurassic Park movies, I'm happy that they finally started making new ones again, I hope the franchise never stops making really cool dino movies, and will continue watching every single one of them."
" Surpassed my expectations.
",2018-08-07 00:00:00,10,Loved it. Long overdue for them to give me a jurassic film as an adult to do justice to the original.
" End credits skipped the best part of the song
",2018-08-05 00:00:00,1,Would give 1000/0 but the end credits dont have the good song
" Low brain Hollywood movie with open mouth roaring monsters
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,2,"That bubble they travel stays on track even when monster trex spin them hard. Than a tiny turn amd they upside down and never spin back no matter what. Trex shake it amd they upside down.
Kids out without bang their head or scratch or pull a muscle or whiplash for shaking so hard.Motorbike in forest ground 40-50miles/hour? Congratulation...Abanodoned jurassic park scene (come on again?) and that building still not cleared out in 22 years.
Dinos roaring and making sounds again without reason.
They run and hunt and making sounds. That is not intelligent hunter. (That means the film makers not intelligent)Birds killing ppl in seconds with poke them. But they not leave with their food. Why not? 
One of them poke a helicopters widscreen together with that guy in a second but cany poke a human? As we saw on JP3 birds was so clamsy, probably they know main caracters in film should not be hurt.Raptors communicate wirh that huge mutant trex, and again, human gestures, and stupid sounds.
Not professional at all. 
Probably even Spielbergs grandkids making better sounds when plays with plastic dinos I guess.
But why they need to make sound anyway? Just stupid.And again raptors surrounds them in the end and nothing happen just staring. Big guy walks in just open mouth roaring again aimlessly.
..and one of the raptors ends in flame. (It should be exploded also haha)And two monsters fights the end, dont understand why (and not communicate in tbis time)
Monster ends in the aquarium with giant watermonster. And making sounds again.That would be the solution to bring the monster straight to the edge of the aquarium instead of put 4 raptors and a Trex in leash.Friendship between trex and raptor is really stupid, but we see the cherry on top when the Trex roaring in the end, again without reason.
(Aquarium idea was way much better)Its an expensive low brain Hollywood movie again as usual.
No brain, without thinking, without reason. But she run high heels in jungle in whole movie."
" Not worth it.
",2018-07-27 00:00:00,4,"Ridiculous plot and characters, no suspense, illogical and with scenes that'll make you laugh at the sheer stupidity of it all. Made for children or people who prefer to shut of their brains while watching movies."
" No srory
",2018-07-21 00:00:00,1,"This movie is a showcase and presentation of computer graphics, and visual effects. there is no story here. 
and their acting is bad.
it would have been better if they put more effort on making a good story and plot, and hired better actors. but all they did was creating more action scenes and displaying their computer graphics ability as much as possible"
" Jurassic World? More like Jurassic Failure!
",2018-07-20 00:00:00,10,This movie completely takes the magic away from Spielberg's original masterpiece! Dinosaurs? More like DinoCGIs! The idea of genetically creating a new dinosaur is a lazy way of creating an antagonist! And you would've thought they learned their lesson from the last 3 damn times!
" FUN AND GOOD
",2018-07-19 00:00:00,6,T's a lot of fun but... forgettable. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are great actors. The former is very charismatic....but the latter? She's..... bland.
" Better then expect it but...
",2018-07-16 00:00:00,7,"First of all, like many of you, I was largely influenced by the reviews which are very harsh. Before letting the reviews guide you through the decision whether your going to watch the movie or not, give it a try. It's way better then you might think but of course there could be some disappointment. After all, no movie is perfect. I'll go with the bright side first. The acting was really good and in no way overdramatized like many are saying. The script was well written but maybe a little predictable here end there. And the dinosaurs were just phenomenal. Now what disappointed me was sorta the development of the movie. The romance between Owen and Claire just didn't really make sense. They first tell us they once went on a date, and expect us out of the blues to understand like there was another movie before this. And if they want to add romance, they should expand it. Make it more obvious there's stuff going on between them. They spend half the movie like they don't know each other and then they kiss, seriously ?! I'll make a reference from the second Jurassic world, were the same thing happens. The other thing I didn't like was its very predictable and typical ending. There's a dinosaur chasing them and they have to kill it, and once they do everyone is happy. I hope they change that in the JW 3, cause its getting a little old. Overall, the movie was great, not amazing, but great. Watch it and make your own opinion."
" No authenticity
",2018-07-14 00:00:00,6,"As a pure dino's fan I was upset by many aspect of the film. First of all, the main attraction is based on a dinosaure that has never existed. This kind of movie should bring to the audiance some knowledge in science and not creating hybrid monster to make the movie scarier.Secondly I can't support when they try to put some emotions in the eyes of a T- Rex or a velociraptor. Those are lizards...they remain reptils, not mammals. The emotion should be brought by the actors which didn't make a good job. A super hero navy seal and a bimbo are not appropriate to be the main character of this movie. Laura Dern and Sam Neil were more authentic and didn't try to be funny when it wasn't necessary.Finally slow motion in a dinosaur fight is completely useless and make the scene less intense. In conclusion apart from all these criticisms, that's a quite good action film (with some excinting moment I must admit) which will delight those who are not dino connoisseurs"
" The whole movie is based on one dumb moment
",2018-07-14 00:00:00,4,"To be clear, I love the franchise, especially the original Jurassic Park. This movie is also great and entertaining but my issue with it is that it is based one very dumb moment. The ""expert"" Owen Grady is taken to check the paddock of the Indominus. The very intelligent dinosaur ""expects"" this and hides its thermal signature. This is all fine. Owen finds the markings on the wall and deducts the asset has escaped. At this point in time logic seems to abandon everybody. Claire drives to the control center while calling them to check the location of the dinosaur, as if that could not have been done from the paddock. Owen decides to enter the paddock with two guards without any confirmation of where the Indominus is. This leads to the escape of the dinosaur as if the cage was made of cheese. Then all sorts of illogical situations pile up one after another. The tracking device seems to have been placed in the one location the Indominus would have been able to claw it out. The team sent to retrieve the asset is sent with toy guns. The boys decide to go on a wild ride among the dinosaurs after receiving the alert that all rides are closed. With all the connected technology, mobile phone coverage seems to be like back in the early 90s. But then when Claire contacts the control center from the original Jurassic Park building right in the middle of nowhere the connectivity is amazing. Claire decides that showing more skin will make her better equipped to handle predators. There are many more facepalm situations but the point is that if Claire had contacted the control center from the paddock as logic dictates, then we would not have had a movie at all."
" An easy way to make a buck off of people (like me) who love dinosaurs so much they'll watch no matter what
",2018-07-11 00:00:00,4,"The creative geniuses over at Hollywood have concocted yet another sequel to unnecessarily reprise a series. Jurasic World is full of cliches and scenes stolen straight from the original. Bryce is your stereotypical privileged city-girl who thinks she knows best because she is in a high powered career. But, at the end of the day she's just a woman and needs Pratt, the equally stereotypical, brawny, cowboy to swoop in and save her with his wilderness skills and masculineness. The brothers that are lost in the park are so generic I can't remember what they look like or anything that they did throughout the whole thing- and I just watched it. The main villain is a genetically altered dinosaur that's supposed to be new and exciting to tourists- but it pretty much just looks like a bigger T-Rex. It has a hodge-podge of powers like camouflage and heat detection, which it rarely uses and has super intelligence. Sure, its a hybrid of many types of dinosaurs but none of the dinosaurs that it was created from would be intelligent enough to create a sophisticated ruse in order to escape or know what a tracking device is. Then, it goes on a sadistic killing-spree for absolutely no reason except plot. Animals don't do this! Not even the really smart ones! Another thing that doesn't make sense: despite super dino roaming the island, determined to exterminate all life Bryce still refuses to evacuate because it may lose money for the park. This just makes her character feel false. She wouldn't be this cold, no way. 
All that being said, watching dinosaurs run around is just fun. No matter how senseless and forced the plot is dinosaurs are awesome and seeing them on screen will always be entertaining. I love dinosaurs so much I'll give it a whole 4 stars."

" There's some entertainment to be had here, but overall it's just mediocre.
",2018-07-10 00:00:00,5,"This long anticipated (for some reason) follow-up is pretty average, and shows that the once masterful 'Jurassic' franchise has become part of the Hollywood money-making machine. Perhaps it shouldn't have been surprising, however, since every 'Jurassic' sequel has been a disappointment. I'm sure that Colin Trevorrow tried to make an interesting film, but it ultimately turned out rather bland. With horrible cinematography, an exposition-filled screenplay, and an over-reliance on CGI (that will make this film seem older than the original in a few decades), 'Jurassic World' is a major disappointment. Still, once you accept that this is going to be a predictable Hollywood blockbuster, there's some passive fun to be had and there are far worse films of this type out there. Chris Pratt is pretty entertaining too. 5/10."
" bad acting but good monsters
",2018-07-10 00:00:00,3,"Nice idea
nice sets
but who cares
acting is not therethe good actors are kept in the background
poor execution"
" They're prostituting the Jurassic Park franchise
",2018-07-09 00:00:00,4,"Im glad i waited 3 years to watch this, i didnt miss a thing. it basically confirmed what i feared, its a monster movie with nonstop action and little to no story. oh and the dopey genetically engineered hybrid indomimus or whatever it was called killed it for me. i know this is supposed to be sc-fi/action but that was a little overly goofy, i kinda tuned out and just laughed at the goofiness of whoever approved this script. 
acting was horrendous as well. particularly the two young boys - whos names i dont even remember cause they were so forgettable, also the 'claire' character was a robot. there was a scene where the boy claimed to have failed his driving test yet he proceeds to haul ass in a manual transmission jeep. lmao. this movie is a joke in more ways than one! these actors had to be... they had to be robots? please tell me they were animatrons or cgi or something? no human being can be this bland lol. with the exception of owen, he was ok.
do these characters return for fallen kingdom? if so i will flat out never watch that movie lol. furthermore, seems like these movies regurgitate what the original jurassic park did; ill give the lost world some credit they did add a different perspective when they placed dinosaurs in our own backyards. i loved the scenes of the t-rex running in the middle of the street and roaming in peoples backyards, that was different that was cool. but these JW movies are so dopey and predictable and an obvious cash grab.this is why the original jurassic park and lost world will always be the best installments in the franchise (change my mind). they told a good story and it was at the forefront of it all, they injected action into the mix just perfect and exactly where it was needed, they didnt just cram action scenes and cgi into every single scene."
" Wow, has humanity really gotten this dumb?
",2018-07-06 00:00:00,4,"Good job Tv, media, government. You have finally done it i think. We as humans have officially become morons in the masses.
Who cares about anything in a movie anymore? As long as it has good CGI hey?
People rating this from 7-10 stars were either dropped on their head at birth or have spent their whole lives in front of the tube watching pure rubbish, making this seem good.It fails on EVERY single level bar CGI. 
*Characters are complete idiots, bar Chris Pratts and what do they make him do? Train Velociraptors to help him fight the big bad dinosaur..
*Story. Yes it's Jurassic Park it doesn't need a great story after the first one, but anything is better than this..
*Acting, nothing memorable, not abhorrent but not overly good either, but hey how can you expect the actors to be memorable with those characters?
*CGI. Top notch.Hell that's a 10/10 right there..To all those who rated this film 9 & 10/10. Thank you for degrading the intelligence of our species. You idiots. You prove time and time again that you will watch anything with CGI. But hey throw in a master piece of an R rated film with violence and that's a horrible, disgusting movie..You make me want to puke.

" Eh
",2018-07-06 00:00:00,6,"I heard they were doing a reboot with Chris Pratt and I was all in - but unfortunately for me, in my mind, I had imagined that they were going to go back to a darker and grittier, more tense feel of the original Jurassic Park - clearly that was my own mistake. This was basically Jurassic Park inside the Marvel world; it felt like a marvel movie not a tense thriller like Spielberg delivered. So, I suppose, if you really like all the Marvel movies (which I do too) then you know what you're getting; however, if like me, you were hoping for a more tense thriller without comedy quips to break any tension that is ever brought up then will will also be disappointed with this film. Not to mention, the plot is very predicable. It is an entertaining enough movie, but it doesn't do anything to truly make it great."
" It was good, but not near as good as the last one.
",2018-07-06 00:00:00,7,"As the title says, I did like the movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as the last one. It was definitely lacking in overall excitement, at least compared to the last one. Honestly, if it wasn't a Jurassic Park movie, I would probably say wait until it comes out to streaming or dvd, but there is still enough to make it worth seeing in the theater. Hopefully if they decide to do a third movie, they will step it up some. I think this one will be similar to how the second movie was, in the original trilogy."
" I suppose this movie would be good if you were 15 or younger
",2018-07-03 00:00:00,3,"Bunch of preditcable cliches, terrible.Disgrace to the original trilogy, even though the second and third weren't good, at all."
" Great
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,8,"I thought this was a great movie. It was funny and everyone played such convincing characters. The storyline was well thought out and really worked, making a superb film. Chris Pratt was phenomenal in this movie. I thought the whole Jurrasic World park was very detailed and made you believe it was a place as it wasn't like a fantasy world where you have flying cars and stuff, if you know what I mean. The story line was definitely advanced and expanded on and am glad I saw this movie. It is for everyone so if you get time, I'd watch it. I've seen it many times and is an easy film to love."
" Well made, but not as good as the original.
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,6,"Although incredibly well-made and entertaining in its own right, I still prefer the original from 20 years ago. Some of the suspense and emotion just feels 'forced' compared to the original where it came naturally. This modernized version just didn't do it for me. It also made me realize how incredible the visual effects of the original actually were, as they seemed more realistic. The effects in this new film are more obvious CGI than 'Jurassic Park'."
" A Special Talent
",2018-06-28 00:00:00,8,"Long gone are the days of rubber animatronic characters in horror movies that wiggle and give away the refined element by seeing the shoes peaking out of the costume of Godzilla. But along with spectacular special effects we have in this movie comes a real responsibility of the director to insure the actors are aimed in the correct focal point and reaction emotions that bring interest not only to the main characters, in this case the dinosaurs, but to their characters as well.With credit being given to the terrific human actors showing for up to do this film we have to remind ourselves they are reacting to a green screen and imaginary set-ups to build hopefully enough suspense to bring the people they portray to hold the audience. Doesn't happen here."
" Nostalgia.
",2018-06-28 00:00:00,10,"That's what made this blockbuster even more enjoyable along with the action and adventure (3/4 of the movie). Exciting twists and turns and suspenseful edge-of-your-seat moments are what make the flick one to not miss. Spielberg out did himself once again, never letting us down, as always. Bringing in familiar themes and the iconic John Williams master piece. My vote for the best remade film of the year and maybe even decade. High above the others or should I say chasing them.

",2018-06-27 00:00:00,4,"It's a bad movie that is semi-enjoyable on the big screen. i'm really glad i didn't watch this movie at home. it was predictable, boring, and really an average action/creature feature movie. i didn't like that they copied scenes from the first jurassic park. please do not buy this movie when it comes out on video, you will regret it"
" some reality for the review
",2018-06-25 00:00:00,1,"I cannot believe this movie scores a 7, especially with a plethora of the most caustic comments you can imagine from folks who agree that this remake is weak beyond words. I have managed to skip Jurassic mania as I sensed it was a bunch of hype but upon seeing trailer for JW2 I became interested (as Chris Pratt as Starlord is amusing as hell). Then I put the DVR on and sat back to find out what all the excitement was about as it must be good to make a sequel to a sequel and theme parks and such. I was mistaken, and I wasn't entirely sure when the feeling hit me that this is a steaming pile of raptor remains, but it was pretty close to when the bigger clueless guard gets munched in one bite, our ""heroes"" escape the plastic orb of doom or Lena Luthor (didn't catch name or her importance in the movie , kind of like the owner who had copter flying issues) being tossed about by pterodactyls (like they wouldn't just fly away) like a frisbee while our ""heroes"" stand around trying to figure out what to do next, or making out for no apparent reason. Stopped there, may not return as I figured military dude will get in a showdown trying to stop Rex and all his men will get their ass kicked till Chris Pine and high heeled partner w kids she doesn't know the heights of fashion a grenade launcher out of spare jeep parts from 20 years ago and save the day. Can't even believe anyone could mention Jurassic anything in the same sentence as The Incredibles I or II as there is no comparison. The ending credits for Incredibles is more entertaining than this POC and if we can somehow dissuade just one person from carrying on the fantasy that this franchise is worthy of anyones time or $$ then this will be worthwhile."
" CGI is everything
",2018-06-25 00:00:00,3,"Acting talent no longer necessary. Trite, cliched dialog, and wooden acting can't save this 50's monster sci-fi update. Greedy corporation designs unstoppable monsters for their theme park.
Would have been better with Peter Graves or Kevin McCarthy.
I gave it a 3 because the CGI was great.Trivia: Heroine never breaks a high heel even running through the jungle. Women don't have to pulled along by the male hero anymore!"
" A great sequal to its original.
",2018-06-25 00:00:00,8,"When I first saw this film, it got me interested. So much, that I did think about seeing it a second time. The plot pays homage to the original 'Jurassic Park' series and it did it well. The jokes in this film were great, and the plot is great also. The acting in this film was good, and the score was just amazing. The only thing(s) that I didn't like about the film is when some of the characters just acted dumb.
The CGI in this film was great and...... yeah, I really can't say more about it. Its just great. I give this a 8/10. If I could, I would consider watching it in theater again."
" And the award for the worst female lead role in history goes to....
",2018-06-24 00:00:00,2,"I watched this snooze fest again last night on TV mainly due to the current hype about the next installment starting at the cinemas. Thought I'd give it another go. I made it to the bit where Godzilla got out before I had to visit the bathroom to puke over this talentless woman's interpretation of her role. Jeez, she looked annoying, she moved annoyingly, she dressed annoyingly and the role itself was beyond stupid. 
We're becoming way too familiar with this dynoworld thing to the point where nothing is special snymote. Ho hum. My kingdom for a good old fashioned story."

 1.)it was co produced and the original jurassic park was produce by steven 
 spielberg so the graphics and storyline would br gr8.
 2.)graphics was done by the 1 and only lord of vfx's industrial light and magic."
" Great movie...a big improvement over JPIII and JP2....
",2018-06-22 00:00:00,10,"This is the movie that made Jurassic Park great again. Flash back to the summer of 2015, when most people thought that Star Wars would dominate the year's box office had it been released during the summer. Thankfully Star Wars was moved to christmas, a smart move given that Jurassic World dominated the box office and broke records set by The Avengers and became the most profitable movie of the franchise in recent memory. Sure, it has its windfalls, but who cares? This movie has plenty of dinosaurs, action, and plain fun!!!"
" This ""Jurassic World"" Has More Bite Then Expected, Despite Flaws
",2018-06-22 00:00:00,6,"3 out of 5 stars (average)I will never understand Hollywood's seemingly immortal fascination with unnecessary reboots and sequels. Since 2010, reboots of popular franchises have been spewing out the back end during the summer months hoping to rekindle the spark gained from the originals. 80's classics Robocop and A Nightmare on Elm Street were given this treatment to mediocre results, both critically and financially. However, some reboots (like Rise of the Planet of the Apes) are successful because they take the franchise into the 21st century, exploring themes and ideas that the original could not.And sometimes, reboots are just fun pieces of escapism that are not meant to be analyzed, just enjoyed.Jurassic World falls into that category. While it isn't as good as the original (come on, who was really expecting that?), this film stands on its own two feet as a fun summer popcorn flick that doesn't require you to think very hard. This seems to be what makes money nowadays, and this film is set to break box office records. Despite some questionable script decisions, Jurassic World is an enjoyable popcorn movie with a great lead performance and intense action.The film follows Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard of 50/50) the owner of ""Jurassic World"", a park where dinosaurs are on display for the general public. The park is a hugely popular tourist attraction made possible by Dr. Wu (BD Wong returning from the first film), a scientist who has been with the park since the beginning all those years ago.To increase tourism (because apparently LIVE DINOSAURS ALONE can't do that), the scientists have genetically engineered a dinosaur. This does not please park trainer and exhibit inspector Owen (Chris Pratt outshining everyone), who treats the dinos with the respect they deserve. It doesn't help that he has Hoskins (Vincent D'onofrio of Netflix's Daredevil) breathing down his neck about using the raptors as weapons of war, something that Owen would not allow. Unfortunately, the genetically-made dino escapes from its enclosure, sending Owen and Claire to find it. To make matters worse, Claire's two nephews (Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson) have come to the park to see their aunt and thus get involved on the action.This film is a lot better than I thought it would be. The action is very intense and most of the dinosaur effects are solid (most of them). Colin Trevorrow (the director of 2012's hit Safety Not Guaranteed) knows how to build tension surprisingly well given that this is his second theatrical release. I'm sad he will not be returning to direct a sequel to this film (and let's just face it, there will be one).Performance-wise, Chris Pratt proves once again why we love him: he has charm, likeability, and charisma unlike many new actors today. He uses his leading-man abilities very well here, outshining Bryce Dallas Howard and even the great D'onofrio (who was absolutely amazing on Daredevil). Howard is giving her second-best performance here, her first being 50/50. For whatever reason, Howard has yet to give a great leading performance in her career. She's not bad by any means, but I wish she would improve a bit. The child actors are surprisingly good (and not annoying), giving performances that seem realistic for the situation they are in (one is a teenager, the other a middle school aged kid). Finally, Irrfan Khan (seen briefly in the first Amazing Spider-Man) delivers a decent performance.The only problems I have with the film are minor ones. First, Claire is wearing heels throughout, running in them with unbelievable ease. I don't wear heels myself, but my sister said that it would be IMPOSSIBLE to run in them. I bring this up because there are several shots of the heels, almost as if the director wanted us to know that she was wearing them. They don't have a payoff, seeming a bit useless in the grand scheme. Also, it is briefly mentioned that the two kids' parents might get a divorce, but we don't see anything to support that. We see the mother (Judy Greer, who really needs to get larger parts) saying good bye in the first scene, and then again when she calls Claire asking about the boys. We never see her and the husband arguing, so it just seemed rushed in. Finally, I felt the opening act was a little slow, but it picks up after about 15 minutes. It's not boring, just character introductions and such.Jurassic World isn't as good as the original, but it does its job well, and that is entertaining the viewer. John Williams' great score is included here, and it's as hard to get out of your head now as it was back in 1993. There were some kids in my theater who weren't too scared by anything, but it depends on the kid. I actually jumped a couple times, but that's just me. Overall, Jurassic World is a fun action flick for the summer crowd.Rated PG-13 for Intense Sequences of Sci-Fi Violence and Peril"
" Seriously!
",2018-06-18 00:00:00,4,"How can a film with a budget this big be so bad? I wanted to leave my living room. The acting and script are ridiculous and as for the SFX.......If this is what constitutes entertainment these days, give me the original anyday."
" Corny generic cheese with some good action visuals
",2018-06-17 00:00:00,3,"Why does Hollywood insist on highly implausible, cheesy rubbish. Why do they insist on making women look like tough heroic survivors, while wearing high heels and being the ""love interest"" during moments of panic and death?There's a scene where people are literally dying all around them, plucked from the ground by nasty flying dinosaurs, and instead of taking cover, the focus becomes a ""kiss"" between the hero dude and this woman, with her nephews watching on, concerned about who this man is. What the hell?Why insult out intelligence? Why sink to these extremely low cheesy levels? It's old, outdated lazy story-telling. Sure there's some decent action, but when you have truly implausible scenes mixed in, you become separated from caring about the story and consequences. It becomes another generic feel-good action with no heart, and no relationship with reality.Please Hollywood, grow up."
" Spielberg Magic, This Is Not. Still, a Visit to Jurassic World Is Worth the Price of Admission.
",2018-06-12 00:00:00,7,"You may have heard some critics champion Jurassic World as ""The best Jurassic Park sequel"", some fans declare that it ""brought them back to their childhood"", and others who may have made the absurd claim, ""It's better than the original"". Don't believe the hype. Jurassic World is nowhere close to the best Jurassic Park sequel (Spielberg's own, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, will always have that title). It is not going to bring you back to your childhood, and it doesn't hold a candle to what Steven Spielberg and crew accomplished with the original Jurassic Park. That being said, in a time of dark, self-serious, and pretentious blockbusters such as last year's Dawn of the Planet of the Apes or Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight films, Jurassic World is a refreshing antidote. Light, wholesome, and heavy on adventure, JW harkens back to the big Hollywood ""event"" blockbusters of the 80s and 90s. Let's just not pretend this is anything groundbreaking. The fourth Jurassic Park movie remembers to have fun with its premise, but Spielberg's magic touch is still sorely missed.Jurassic World is the latest film in the Jurassic Park franchise in name only. Call it a sequel, reboot, or re-quel, the fact remains, this is not the same world created by author Michael Crichton and made real by Spielberg and company in 1993. All the major characters from the first three films are gone. Alan Grant, Ellie Satler, Ian Malcolm, and the rest of the appealing and memorable characters of the earlier movies are replaced with broad movie archetypes and superfluous supporting characters. With respect to our new kid characters and Vincent D'Onofrio's bone-headed military grunt, the only two characters worth noting in Jurassic World are Owen Grady, a rugged dino-expert played by bona fide movie star Chris Pratt, and Claire Dearing, an uptight scientist played by Bryce Dallas-Howard. Both are really likable in doses, and the script doesn't subject us to too much of their dopey bantering. While Owen and Claire are cliched, and ultimately uninteresting, as characters, the charm and sheer star power of Pratt and Dallas-Howard are quite enough to bolster JW's brand of disposable summer adventuring.There's a neat little hook to the story of Jurassic World. After a re-branding of sorts, John Hammond's dream is finally realized and Jurassic Park is opened and fully operating. However, when the public begins to lose interest in seeing the same old dinosaurs, the scientists of Jurassic World are prompted to create an all-new hybrid dinosaur called the Indominus Rex. Well, you guessed it, that dinosaur escapes. Okay, so that's a clever solution to the classic Jurassic Park sequel dilemma, ""How does this stuff keep happening?"", but that plot line takes all of twenty minutes to peter into a chase picture, and a simple one at that. The few subplots are banal. Be it, two brothers who come to Jurassic World to spend time with their aunt, or a ridiculous plan to weaponize velociraptors (The latter of those subplots is one of the most embarrassingly stupid ideas I've seen in a movie in years), Jurassic World doesn't have much to get invested in besides big scary monsters running after people.There is one aspect of the film that I love, and that is the design of the Jurassic World Resort. The care that went into perfecting the look of the theme park is a great deal higher than the care that went into the story or the filmmaking. Jurassic World is a living, breathing place, and it is filled with all kinds of minor details that help sell the illusion. The triceratops petting zoo, the hamster ball ride, the souvenir shops, and scores of other theme park related details are touches that I was grateful made it into the film. There are more than a few nice moments where you get to enjoy the park as it was ""intended"". The immersion lasts throughout, even as the prehistoric psycho-killer, and all the destruction that it brings, takes center stage. Once the Indominus Rex gets out, and all Hell breaks loose, director Colin Trevorrow's filmmaking starts to show its deficiencies. Jurassic World is an impressive technical feat. The action is staged well, and the special effects and production designs are incredibly polished. It all looks like a million bucks (or 150 million to be exact), and it's all very fun, but when it comes to the meat of the movie, it's foolish to think that Jurassic World is anything more than Transformers with dinosaurs. In Jurassic Park and The Lost World, Steven Spielberg infused his action scenes with tension and suspense. There was a certain kind of visual poetry to the T-Rex attack in the first movie or the raptors in the grass scene from The Lost World. They were exhilarating because of their selective restraint. Without showing everything, Spielberg made scenes that were subtle and scary, and that exploded to life at just the right moments. Jurassic World's action scenes are big, loud, and entertaining, but it's all chaos, no technique. Trevorrow throws the kitchen sink into every shot. The Indominus Rex chomps up dozens of machine gun toting mercenaries, pterodactyls dart all over the screen pecking and biting everything in sight, and big, lumbering CGI beasts fight each other and destroy every last peanut brittle building around them. Sound familiar? It's the kind of Call of Duty-esque sensory bombardment that can be loads of fun to watch while you're there but doesn't leave the lasting impact of truly great action.So it is with Jurassic World. The movie is big, bright, and fun, with lots of action and good special effects. It pleases crowds. But as with most big budget crowd pleasers, it comes with dull characters, brain dead plotting and booming CGI overload. Jurassic World left me with the exact same feeling I got after seeing Jurassic Park 3. Both movies are serviceable summer romps, full of dino-action and great visual effects, but there is simply a noticeable dip in the quality of the production. Jurassic World successfully mines from the franchise name a good B-caliber FX spectacular. For dumb summer fun, it works. But there was a time when Jurassic Park aspired to more than dumb summer fun. Steven Spielberg's first two movies had class. They grappled with ideas, they were intelligent, they showcased real filmmaking, and they were genuinely thrilling. Jurassic World is colorful and entertaining, but let's be clear, when it's all said and done, nothing beats Spielberg. 74/100"
" I hate this.
",2018-06-11 00:00:00,6,"Ok I really liked the trailer and when I first saw the movie around the time it came out I liked it a-lot. But then later as I began to watch more and more of the movie other time I began to realize I hated this movie and that it wasn't as good as people said it was. Ok for one why is it that everything goes wrong so easily. What people sometimes don't realise is that the entire film takes place in the span of around 16 hours. How does all this stuff go down in such a short amount of time. It takes just 2/3's of a day for everything to go to hell and everybody's lives being ruined forever. Then there are the two kids, while not being as bad as the first pair of kids in the first movie, I still don't really like them. Probably because in almost every scene there in, in the last 2/3's of the movie they are just magnets for the dinosaurs to attack. Also then theres there parents who as shown in one scene are getting a divorce. Now I know that in a movie that would be a good premise but in a movie with dinosaurs crawling around killing people not so much.Claire I thought was going to be your stereotypical work addicted character who was going to get killed but she gets better as the film goes on. But I liked her much better in the films sequel. Chris Pratt does a pretty good job as his character too. He's riding of the success of guardians of the galaxy and the lego movie and he plays his character well.With all that say I don't hate this movie that much but I do give this movie:6 out of 10."
" Not as good as JP1, but better than JP3
",2018-06-10 00:00:00,7,"Of all the dinosaur movies I have watched, this is one of the better series. It's actually pretty good for a sequel/reboot. More dinosaurs, plus we get Chris Pratt. He's my new favorite actor. And he really works in this one. I didn't get to watch this one in theaters, but I did rent it and was pleasantly surprised. Much of the thrills from the original are still fresh, and it was better than Jurassic Park 3. Soon we will be getting Fallen Kingdom and I'm sure it'll be good. There were also good scenes and well-done sets for the amusement park. Even if you haven't seen the original, give this a try and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. If you like dinosaurs in a modern setting, this is where to look."
" Tries to recreate a classic but only takes its most surface of elements; in the end, it just feels like filler.
",2018-06-10 00:00:00,4,"'Jurassic World (2015)' apes the most surface-level aspects of the franchise's first entry without ever recreating what made that film so special. It almost entirely omits the themes that make the concept itself interesting and it misses out on any engaging characters, through which we should be viewing these extraordinary events in order to actually care about them. It also manages to totally overload the original trilogy's computer-to-practical ratio, losing out on all components that could make its, admittedly sometimes impressive, visual effects seem truly believable. The CG always feels exactly as such and doesn't become an extension of the story or world, unable to elicit the wonder or fear it once did with ease twenty-five years ago. It doesn't help that most of the narrative is essentially nonsensical and every few moments there's something to roll your eyes at. Plot points provoke pained sighs as opposed to a widening of the eyes, and the exposition is so blatant that it's a wonder why you're shown anything at all. It gets to a point where you realise that the filmmakers don't trust you to understand their narrative and so tell you everything at least twice, even when it's right there on screen. The movie is more interested in showing you dinosaurs dealing out damage to one another than anything else, with the suspense the series is known for at perhaps its least prominent. It really is the lack of character, despite the many core players (who all consistently make unintelligent and unbelievable decisions, by the way), that puts the final nail in the coffin of this technologically advanced but entirely less believable sequel, though. It just goes to show you that the script is the most important thing, everything else is just filler. Filler is exactly what this feels like. 4/10"

" Nice film)
",2018-06-07 00:00:00,8,"Twenty years ago, people decided to play with evolution and resurrected long-extinct species. The amusement park, where the main attraction was dinosaurs, was to be a hit, but became famous for its tragic deaths. After a while people decided to give a lucrative idea a second chance, and here appeared the ""World of the Jurassic period"", offering visitors an unforgettable family vacation. But how much safer is it than its predecessor?Return to the big screens of great and toothy was just a matter of time. The story was too good to leave her alone. Inspired by a new life entrusted to director Colin Trevorow, who himself is a big fan of dinosaurs. He decided to show how he could bring the insatiable and out-of-control desire of humanity to be constantly entertained. In pursuit of money and new impressions, they bring out a new species, never before stepped on our planet. What can go wrong?The characters of the film, especially as for those who work in such a dangerous amusement park, where accidents happen all the time, are mostly too careless and narrow-minded. The owner of the island does not know at all what is being deduced in his laboratories, the security system operates only when the animals behave decently, one wants to write down as a matter of fact the wild raptors to serve in the army, and children can easily escape and during an alarm to stay alone on the field among dinosaurs, because the employees of the attraction are too busy saving their skins and incompetent to the limit. And what to do, when a huge dangerous predator of a new breed escapes, nobody knows at all.Well, that on the island works a certain Owen, who almost only understands that dinosaurs are living creatures, not toys. Chris Pratt's play here is pretty plausible, especially its interaction with the raptors. In the light of rumors that he might become the new Indiana Jones, it was nice to see him in a similar image, which he is very much following. The Pratt company is Bryce Dallas Howard, for whom this is the next vivid role after the ""Servants"". She has her own moments and potential, but it feels like the writers specifically held her back so that she did not become equal with him, preferring to keep her heroine in the shadow of Owen. By the way, the only actor from the original was BD Wong, who again embodied Dr. Henry Wu.""The world of the Jurassic period"" is clearly aware that it is simultaneously the continuation of the original, and the restart of history, which should breathe new life into the franchise. To the very original, creators reacted almost with sacred trembling, references to ""Park"" are found throughout the entire film. There is even a character-geek performed by Jake Johnson, who seems to be the embodiment of the fandom.Steven Spielberg, of course, put his hand to this continuation of his prehistoric brainchild, but only as an executive producer. Together with Trevorow and the huge team behind the creation of this blockbuster, we are going to an island where many would like to visit, despite the deadly danger in its cages.The dinosaurs themselves on the screen impress with their realism. When raptors appear, it's like seeing old and almost kind friends. With them, there are a lot of great moments, in particular their communication with Owen. Their joint pursuit, depicted on the poster for the film, is one of the most exciting moments of the franchise. But the most impressive episode is the final battle of dinosaurs. I was delighted with who the writers were instructed to save everyone from the new predator. The original is always steeper than any remake.Continuing 2 hours, this adventure will not let you get bored and will please the dinosaur lovers, who opened their mouths with surprise and delight at viewing the ""Park"". The plot of ""Peace"" is based on the idea that formed the basis of the original: people played in the gods. Heroes again create what they can not control, and then pay for it. It would seem that it is time for mankind to learn from its mistakes, but, judging by the history, we often do them again and again. And the creation of dinosaurs is far from the most serious of them.Crossing the types of the most dangerous dinosaurs, it is worth to be prepared for the fact that family rest on such an island will turn into a chase for survival."
" Watchable, once.
",2018-06-07 00:00:00,7,"I just watched Jurassic World on Youtube for just a few bucks.
Served the purpose, as I don't pay to go see movies in the theatre.
The cinematography technology is really good - I am awed at where movie tech has ascended to.
It is definitely a kids movie so you might hear rave reviews from them.
Ms. Howard was new to me ( again, I am not an avid movie-goer) and she did well enough in a big production like this.
I wouldn't spend the time to watch again - missing the draw / signs of a superb or timeless movie.But, very watchable, high paced throughout. I am sure the effect of seeing on the big screen with huge dinosaur heads breathing at you would have its great effect."
" Go watch it for the Dinos!!
",2018-05-28 00:00:00,9,The Dinos are back and they are as ferocious as ever. Jurassic World succeeds because it is great entertainment. Not as great as the original but certainly on par with the Lost World if not better. Chris Pratt and Brys Dallas Howard easily fill the shoes left vacant by Laura Dern and Sam Neill
" Nephews gyrosphere and I-Rex route goof
",2018-05-27 00:00:00,7,"The two kids travel north - in the direction of the I-Rex restricted paddock area - then find the gate forced open inwards (presumably by the I-Rex) and go through it. They are then attacked and the escape the gyrosphere, but when and how had the I-Rex remained in the northern part of the park after smashing the gate as we see the corpses of numerous brachiosaurs it has killed in the park and then it's north of the gate again at the original 1993 JP centre - it appears omnipresent!"
" If you love the Jurassic movies, it's a 9.

The plot was as believable as a movie about dinosaurs can be. It's just a really fun movie to watch with nifty nods to the original but still content-heavy enough to hold its own weight."

" I wasn't that impressed
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,6,"It had some cool action scenes, but the characters were mostly boring and the pacing sometimes dragged. The dinosaurs looked more real than the third movie, but I didn't care very much for the human characters. They didn't seem that shocked under the circumstances of the dinosaurs attacking and there was too much scientific talk. It was easier to process the conversations in the first movie and the characters had more personality."
" Movie can't decide if it wants to be funny or serious
",2018-05-19 00:00:00,3,"Claire is one of those too stupid to live heroine who runs a forest park in high heels and ridiculous white outfits. I don't care what you say, you can't run in high heels for one hour like she spends her time doing in the movie. Not only that, she runs as fast as Owen Grady, ex-navy outfitted in boots. She seems to be in charge of the park, but faced with a monster threatening 20 000 people she leaves everything to go and rescue 2 people (She doesn't have ANY survival skills... And Nonooo... why would she think to take one second to put on boots or get any weapon)A park of that size without proper evacuation procedures wouldn't be allowed to exist. And that in the direst situations the genetist who created the monster still doesn't want to say what's in that dinosaur so that people can assess what it can do and take the necessary measures is just plain ridiculous. Given the size of the massacre, for me the overall tone of the movie was not appropriate at all. And for the person in charge to get out scots free is... not right.3 stars is for Chris Pratt and Omar Sy (I am just biased I like the french actor), and for the monster dinosaur who was the real star of the movie."
" the epitome of everything wrong with hollywood

" Good, but in some ways bad
",2018-05-09 00:00:00,8,"I have mixed feelings about Jurassic World. In some ways, it was great to see the dinosaurs again in a brand new story, with new action scenes, and new deaths.On the other hand, hybrids... I will probably never be okay with Jurassic World's inclusion of the Indominus Rex hybrid. It was a cool idea, but I don't like it. The indominus, in my opinion, was just unrealistic, and too overpowered. It has been confirmed that Giganotosaurus DNA was present in the indominus, and i think Giganotosaurus would have made a much better antagonist.Similarly, I have mixed feelings about the premise of raptors being trained. it was a cool idea, but it watered them down way to much, making them seem like guard dogs instead of the terrifying killers they were established as in the previous films. However, it was still sad to see Charlie, Echo, and Delta go. The emotion and sadness as such a prominent theme was one of my favorite parts about this movie. I also liked the Pterosaur escape scene, and my favorite creature in this movie was probably the mosasaurus. It's definitely a fun movie worth watching, but it fails to surpass the previous movies."

",2018-04-28 00:00:00,1,I was thoroughly disappointed by the fact that there was no banner fall during the end scene like in the first Jurrassic Park. I am a banner enthusiast and only enjoy movies that employ the use of a good banner scene.
" The film started so promisingly, but it went very wrong
",2018-04-22 00:00:00,3,"I thought Jurassic World started on a good premise; the original film showed the park fail before it opened, but this film showed a successful park at its peak.
And like any theme park, the managers focussing on analysis score and rating etc and typically pushing for anything to raise its performance.The science of the park led them into genetic engineering, an area they had touched on in the original film as they had completed genetic codes with that on amphibians. But here they ran with it more, using modern techniques to create a dinosaur, the indominus rex.As in the original Jurassic Park, and a theme that was continued in part by both sequels, the film focused on two children who were related to the main operator of the park (Mr Masrani was basically an investor, not the one who ran the park)I liked the ideas behind the training of the raptors, building on the underlying premise of Jurassic Park 3 that raptors were smart creatures and, as is human nature, the military were looking to use that to thier advantage.I though how they set the raptors loose to hunt the indominus rex was a bit predictable, as was the fact that it was part raptor itself and they joined with it to fight/hunt the humans. How did they not see that coming?I thought how the raptors turned against the indominus rex seemed a bit out of place, yes they probably were closer to Owen as he had raised them, but for lethal pack hunters it seemed a bit implausible.
Predictably, and naturally, the indominus rex was winning the fight (it was bigger and stronger with more teeth) and eventually only one raptor remained.When Clare went to get the tyrannosaur to fight the indominus rex it seemed very odd, a big predator and the main 'villain' of two previous films suddenly easily controlled? Unlikely
I realise it had received some training itself with the flare leading to food, but why didn't it try to eat Clare as she was holding the flare?With the tyrannosaur in the fight the film turned very poor, I can see what they were trying for - nature vs genetic creation - but what they got was a rather pathetic 'tag team' whereby two dangerous predators worked together to fight the indominus rex, leading it to the pool where the mosasaurus finished it off.
Then to add insult to injury the tyrannosaur and raptor shared a 'knowing look' before going their separate ways, it was very cheesy and I was half-expecting them to high-five.The ending seriously let this film down, a film that started so promisingly."
" Nice visuals. Terrible characters/story.
",2018-04-15 00:00:00,5,"Jurassic World is shockingly rewatchable. Before I started watching it I was dreading the thought of it, since I didn't thought much of the film the 1st time I saw it. But as soon as it started, it wasn't that bad.I still don't think the film is good. It's certainly terrible when it comes to story and characters, but it's pretty well put together in the technical departments. Like the sets, the locations. The park in Jurassic World feels like a real park. Something that exists and it's physically possible for me to visit.
And that's such a breath of fresh air, especially when you start thinking about all those Marvel and DC films. Take Black Panther for instance. Comparing Wakanda or even the scenes in South Korea with anything from Jurassic World, and Black Panther comes out losing, because it's scenery looks fake as sh**. While here, everything looks nice, clean and authentic.Jurassic World as great production value. Something that's important if you want your film to look good. Now, where the film fails where others might succeed is: in the direction, the characters, the tone and the plot.Wanting to use Raptors in a real like war scenario and believing that Raptors would be better than modern technology is stupid. It makes no sense. If you were talking about dropping a few Raptors in an enemy camp in order to create chaos, then yes. That makes sense. But wanting Raptors to team up with soldiers and thinking this is better than using some piece of technology... Its just stupid.For some reason everyone treats this new dinosaur has some kind of Godzilla type threat. Something that's impossible to destroy even with nuclear weapons. And when you see her getting easily wounded when a missile barely hits her... You start realizing that maybe the problem isn't the fact that this dinosaur is smarter than the others. Maybe the problem is that the people in charge of the park are really bad at their jobs. Like, they are the most incompetent idiots you could ever have hired.And the tone is all over the place. Between the nostalgic soundtrack and the park, which is meant to make you remember that feeling you had when you saw the original. You have forced humour that reminds you of Disney films. Violent animal attacks that are presented in this visceral, gritty realistic way. Something that just doesn't mix with the childish characters and stupid one-liners. It just becomes awkward. The film becomes a giant, bloody mess of different ideas, each one executed in a different way.Giving it a 5/10."
" More teeth, please
",2018-04-13 00:00:00,8,"When reading reviews about Jurassic World upon its theatrical release, I was baffled by a large number of mixed reviews: some people loved it and some hated it or dismissed it.
Now, I'm not a huge fan of the first three films, but, in all honesty, Jurassic World kicks butt; it sports all the necessary elements for a very re-watchable piece of entertainment: it's bigger, faster and louder and contains some powerful cheering moments.
This could have suffered the same fate as Jurassic Park: The Lost World but thanks to the heady approach of sequel/reboot, Jurassic World feels fresh and stands its own, you don't have to have seen the previous installments and you won't have to watch the next.
This is what I called the perfect pop-corn film: wholly enjoyable, re-watchable and leaves wanting you more.
More teeth, please."
" Good Effort!!!
",2018-04-01 00:00:00,8,"Well, after Jurassic Park 1, the expectations were set very high as it was one of the best movies of that time with outstanding thriller and action. Then came park 2 which was disappointment and then 3 which was also very much entertaining but don't know why it got low scores. And now The World, it deserves 7+ points because of its beautiful graphics and very entertaining story. There were some flaws like Irfan''s character was very weak and also a little bit childish but the rest of the cast performs well, the theme of overall movie is good and it was full of entertainment for people less than 40."
" Reasons why JW is BAD.
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,1,"The sexual politics of Jurassic World are an unfortunate 180-degree turn from the original movie. Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire Dearing is a flat, limited depiction of a career woman who has apparently rid herself of all human emotion for the chance to excel at her job.She's a rigid, unsympathetic character until she finds her maternal instinct, which she's obviously buried underneath all that career ambition.The funny, lovable Chris Pratt also gets reduced to a swaggering, sweaty mess who communicates better with dinosaurs than he does humans.It's a stupid, retrograde disservice not just to the audience, but to the legacy of the original Jurassic Park, which, 22 years ago, gave men and women equal footing against humanity's real enemy, dinosaurs.I'll fully buy into the fact that Jurassic World exists in a future where we've grown bored by dinosaurs and where Burt Macklin communicates with velociraptors, but I can't suspend my disbelief long enough to believe any woman would trek through the jungle with those stupid, silly shoes still on her feet without breaking her ankle, foot or neck.One other large failing of the film is it's inability to provide a believable bond between the two brothers, Zach and Gary Mitchell. The kids are cute, but for much of the movie it feels like older brother Zach isn't just disinterested in his younger sibling, but might actively hate him. Plus, his constant leering at teenage girls is super creepy.Zach might come around at the end, but it shouldn't take almost getting mauled by a giant prehistoric monster to show some brotherly affection.Jurassic World is built upon the idiocy of the masses (the general public is swarming to a dinosaur park once again after two major catastrophes and another incident that required a military rescue in Jurassic Park III, really?), but there is rarely a scene in the film that doesn't require an extreme suspension of disbelief.Zach and Gray can fix a Jeep that hasn't moved for decades because they remembered the time they fixed up Grandpa's old Malibu? Claire knows how to operate an assault rifle, and can also outrun a T-Rex?Even the villains' motivations are shallow at best. You're telling me that Dr. Henry Wu (played by B.D. Wong), the lead scientist at a dinosaur theme park who has the power and freedom to literally play God with prehistoric animals, would actually put all of that in jeopardy by making a shady deal with Hoskins, who intends to sell dinosaurs to the military? Sure!Jurassic World is a series of very cool dinosaur rampage scenes and mind-numbing filler that sets up the next dinosaur rampage scene. The action itself is jaw-dropping at times, but the story itself has no substance.Lowery, the nerdy lovelorn underling who is the true star of the movie, jokes about the park selling out to sponsors and suggests that they introduce the ""Pepsisaurus"" or the ""Tostitodon"" to the public, but the hilarious line was sandwiched between Zach showing off his Beats By Dre while riding in a Mercedes and Claire using her Samsung phone. I realize the original Jurassic Park featured quite a few Jeeps, but Jurassic World is completely over the top.Dr. Ian Malcolm said it best in 1993: ""You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could, and before you even knew what you had - you patented it and packaged it and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox and now you're selling it."""
" An Excellent Movie.
",2018-03-23 00:00:00,9,"Real Action, Real Adventure, Fights full of excitement, Funny couple.
I really enjoyed it.
I recommend it.
I hope that "" Jurassic World: Fallen Kindom "" be even better, I can't wait it."
" How can I trust IMDB after this?
",2018-03-19 00:00:00,1,"7 ... you cant be serious ... !
What should we give the ""original"" Jurassic movies then? 20 ...?
The first three Jurassic movies had everything, that this movie have not."
" Mildly diverting popcorn flick
",2018-03-09 00:00:00,6,"Dumb to the point of brain death, this takes Jurassic Park and turns everything up by eleventy-stupid.Noisy CGIfest that has nothing original to say but it's still kinda fun in it's own dumb way."
" Worth the wait!
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,8,"I'm really glad that after waiting such a long time for the franchise to return, they made a decent movie!Lots of action as usual and some unexpected twists as well. Loved all the references to the previous movies... both the obvious and subtle ones. If you've watched the previous movies enough times, chances are you will catch these intentional references dispersed throughout the film.The only thing that irritated me about the movie was the unrealistic footwear one of the characters was wearing. If you see it I'm sure you'll know what I mean lol."
" Worst movie ever
",2018-02-22 00:00:00,1,"I don't know where to start. Everything in this mlvie is awful. The maverick wearing a Han Solo vest, the incompetent and irrational CEO, the security who cannot secure themselves, nothing makes sense in this movie. People are dying, but nobody acts. There is no emrgency training, no worst case scenario. It is crap!"
" An excellent reboot of the franchise
",2018-02-21 00:00:00,7,Everything you expect from a big budget Hollywood movie and a great way to relaunch the series.
" Restarts the Franchise
",2018-02-19 00:00:00,9,"I appreciate why some of the reviews are poor and it was never going to have the magic of the original however personally I loved it.No one was really expecting it to do as well as it did at the box office but sometimes what people really want is good, old fashioned escapism. To often we expect films to have a strong moral or social message but why does this always have to be the case. It was first and foremost a film about a dinosaur theme park and I feel that needs to be kept in focus. It was never going to have an incredible script or complete characters but its a fun and exciting film - is that not enough?Great special effects and humorous without trying to make every other line a joke. I've seen it many times now and looking forward to the sequel."
" So bad we were shouting at the screen
",2018-02-17 00:00:00,1,"Where to start?
 Nobody, just nobody, could actually be as bad as these characters are at their jobs and actually keep them, no matter how useless some people actually are. So any believability has gone by five minutes in.
 Cardboard characterisation and a dreadful script - seriously, the 'We've got to keep the park open no matter how many people get eaten' and 'We can't kill the expensive dinosaur that is eating everyone' lines are not only infuriatingly fatuous but out of date since Jaws. The main female character is patronising, stupid, screechy, argumentative, arrogant and incompetent, but I have a horrible feeling we are supposed to admire her. Most of the male leads are either brash idiots or speak in cliches. The only likeable one gets killed in a helicopter crash. The children contribute nothing to the film and the parent divorce theme is clearly there to try and make us care about them, which it doesn't. 
It tries to make up for this by shoving dinosaur attacks in every few minutes - but they're all the same so after a while we were just laughing. It was soooo predictable. My son started keeping a body count.
Apparently raptors are now trainable. When the plot requires it, of course, they're not. But then they are again. Just like that. So there goes that bit of tension from the first film.
The end fight has no suspense but by then we didn't care - making dinosaurs bigger does not make them more interesting. 
'Well, where do we go now?' says the female lead at the end, whose deliberate and wilful stupidity as the person in charge of the park led to 37 people being eaten, hundreds injured, and millions of pounds of damage. You long to hear the male lead tell her 'Well, prosecution and a long jail sentence for you,' but he doesn't. They walk off into the light.
It was embarrassing to see what the fantastic vision of the first film has been reduced to. This one gives the impression of being made by numbers and from a cynical concern for focus groups rather than any desire to tell a story."
" Huge dissapointment for the fans of the previous movies
",2018-02-14 00:00:00,4,"There's a new Jurassic Park movie upcoming this summer, so i decided it would be a good time to watch again all of the previous ones now. I was a kid when the first Jurassic Park came and i loved it. Second movie felt actually better now and it isnt a bad movie, although i dont like the ending part. I remember third movie being bad, but it isnt that bad either! Its pretty boring movie, but the flaws are not the kind of Jurassic World...I had to stop re-watching this movie after an first hour, because of stupid screen writing. First ~40mins are ok and the plot isnt that bad, but nowadays hollywood destroyes almoust every possible good movie with constant action and cgi. Heres only couple of things before i had to stop: 
1: People try and can teach raptors to obey. Idiotic. 
2: Security strategy is beyond stupid. There would be no way in hell a random security guy could just open a gate from indominus rex cage that easily. 
3. Indominus Rex is too smart. Removes implants and whatever, blaa blaa. Maybe it could write a better script? 
4. Stupid people and kids acting stupid. Please not this anymore?! 
5. Everything goes wrong at the right time. Like cellphone rings but you cant hear warnings. 
6. Lets go and get raptors to fight against indominus rex!I cant understand people who have rated this movie 10 or 9. This movie is a mockery to first one. Good dinosaur movie doesnt need constant action showing as much as possible cgi. I truly hope the next one this summer isnt bad as this, but after seeing the trailer and comments i know im going to be dissapointed AGAIN. I hope people would stop watching these all CGI-dont care script-movies. If i had a kid, i would show him the first one (maybe second and third) but not this."
" A 3 is generous. Dull, cliche ridden, hackneyed, predictable, stupid
",2018-02-11 00:00:00,3,"Dull, cliche ridden, hackneyed, predictable, stupid and those are the reasons I give it a 3 instead of lower. The characters do predictable stupid things over and over.. Is there danger? Yes so RUN OUT IN THE OPEN instead of going inside. As the dino's are attacking we see people running OUT of buildings right into the path of the toothy dinos.And of course there is ALWAYS an SUV, or Quad right at hand when our hero's need one... keys in it of course... yet all the screaming people have been running right by them rather then jumping in and driving the hell away.Yes, it's a movie but can't we keep at least some reality of physics in dino stories. It is NOT possible for ANY flesh and blood animal to swing it's arms and tails around and smash thru huge concrete columns and turn them to dust without doing massive damage to their own body. Yet time and again the arms and tails go swinging and knocking down multiple foot thick concrete stuff.And really, you are going to take out these dinos with assault rifles? Of course the assault rifles are worthless but someone did have the sense to bring ONE grenade launcher with them which blows up dino's just in the nick of time. And of course we wouldn't want to give away our position although we do shine laser gun sights right at the dino which would lead them straight back to where the gun holder is.How on god's green earth this movie gets 10's is beyond me. Even if you ignore the stupidity, etc it is SO predictable that there is not a moment of suspense in the whole thing."
" The best Jurassic Park sequel... which is not saying much.
",2018-02-10 00:00:00,7,"I was a little kid when the legendary work of Steven Spielberg came into life. The dream of every child not brainwashed came into cinema: Dinosaurs coming into life from drops of blood obtained from mosquitoes. The empathy you actually feal to the characters. It is a true piece of art. Then 2 (sad goldbloom) and 3 (Alan!) came and pretty much transformed the legendary piece into garbage. Now lets check the fourth installment of the franchise (yeah, fourth. The film acknoledges this).The good part: The cinematography is angelical. Not demeaning the photography. Both aspects are fenomenal. Even when the CGI was added the fotography is angelical, even when CGI was supremely obvious. Specially in shots that should have been done with practical effects, like the dying brontosaurus one, even if it was a little forced, specially because you were at all not worried about YOUR NEPHEWS ARE ACTUALLY BEING HUNTED BY A DINOSAUR.The music is extraordinary... because most of it was actually just recompositions from the preceding films.The bad and ugly: The characters and the plot. Both of them are important if not the most important part of any film. Let's start with the characters: You feel no empathy for them. You actually couldn't give any less of a damn for them. The brothers tried to get your empathy... about the 2 hour mark. Not a good moment in a 2 hours and a quarter movie. The aunt was seriously forced on you to like her and to consider her relatable to the Chris Pratt character but... no. Impossible. There was absolutely no chemestry between them. You could have erased her, her sister and the dad out of the movie and nothing would have changed. The ""villain"" was even worse: You hate him but not because the character, but because you are actually forced to hate him, like in a cartoon: ""This are the good guys, this is the bad guy. Hate him for not discernible reason"" The bosses are idiots, the friend of Chris Pratt was actually there for 5 minutes... Actually, the only character you end empatizacing with is Chris Pratt. It is the only one you root for.The plot is painful: It's the first movie. Seriously, it is the first movie, but with a dinosaur vs dinosaurs battle at the end. Nothing else matters.To say it shortly: an enjoyable film for the images, but not for the plot. I recommend to stay with Jurassic Park."
" Is this the standard we hold to movies these days?
",2018-02-05 00:00:00,3,"I cannot believe what I am reading. Sorting reviews by most helpful, they are mostly giving the movie 10/10. Did we watch something different?This movie contains almost no character development. I seriously can't even remember their names by this point. Also, the cliches with the stories were plentiful. The CGI was overdone and the entire movie leaves the audience feeling detached from reality.Seriously, give this one a pass. By far the wort Jurassic movie."
" a pinnacle of forced writing that cements the downhill trend of the franchise with each consecutive film
",2018-02-03 00:00:00,1,"This movie has it all: forced straight romance, cheap charater deaths to get the audience emotional with cheap writing, plot devices that make zero sense in context, and so fourth. they give the main dinosaur all kinds of genetic splicing abilities that, while badass, go counter to its purpose as a zoo exhibit. things get out of control simply because it is expected, not because it makes sense in the story. and the cherry on top, the ending. the movie ends with a huge spectacle that goes against everything we've come to understand of the creatures. could a movie be worse? absolutely! but that does not change the fact that this movie is plain bad."
" This is just bad
",2018-01-21 00:00:00,3,"My title says it all. This film is nothing more than a ton of special effects, impossible action sequences, and ridiculous writing. 
Jurassic Park succeeded because it was fresh, well written, and had an exceptional case of actors. You felt the characters' excitement and wonder, and they behaved EXACTLY as a normal human being would. That made the film enjoyable, wonderful, and suspenseful. 
This movie has exactly zero of any of that. Characters that play park employees (other than the primaries), are slovenly fools, plain and simple. You could care less if they live or die. The boys are not cute, clever, or interesting. They really add nothing to the story, and I suspect they're there to give both teen and preteen girls somebody to (the writers hoped) like in the movie. The main woman is simply a dunce. Other than her physical appearance, she offers nothing of substance to the story. The main game master is really the only believable character - and just barely. 
Shall we discuss one of my biggest problems with this sorry mess? We've learned through the first three films that in the Jurassic Worlds, Velociraptors are the most intelligent and dangerous animals ever. But In this movie, the powers that be decide it's a good idea to release a pack of these predators to, wait for it, hunt down and contain the new Supersaurus Rex. Of course, there's just no chance the raptors would choose instead to hunt easy human prey is there? Utter balderdash. 
Hollywood has either forgotten or chooses to ignore a simple truth: MAKE YOUR CHARACTERS BELIEVABLE AND LET THEM ACT LOGICALLY. 
So, why did I give this even 3 stars? The cinematography was well done...and I like dinosaurs!"
" Women are never bad
",2018-01-21 00:00:00,5,"Major flaw in this story and many Hollywood stories nowadays. Women are never responsible for anything. The character Claire that is in charge of the park gets dozens of people killed and 100s injured and the movie portrays her as a hero! Madness! If her character was a man, he would've been eaten by dinosaurs or imprisoned. Not only does her character do nothing right in the movie but somehow Chris Pratt falls in love with her. Why? Because she's so good at getting people killed? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!"
" The 4th Highest-Grossing Film Ever
",2018-01-16 00:00:00,4,"Jurassic World, the sequel we all wanted? My response to this question would be no. This movie does remind us of one thing for sure though, Spielberg knew how to not rely on CGI, and still have an entertaining story and well-rounded characters. That is the biggest issue that I have with this movie. Jurassic World's director, Colin Trevorrow thrives in one of those categories and lacks in the others. Our lead actors Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) are perfectly fine, but it seems that there is something holding them back. Maybe it is the four writers this movie had? Or maybe it is the constant product placement that is used. This problem continues throughout the movie with some of the supporting actors as well. We get a bland underdeveloped teen (Zach) that is focused on his phone and girls, and his little brother (Gray) who is fine but predictable. At times, the movie had me entertained though. I think there is something about dinosaurs that amazes us all, considering this is the 4th installment of a ""Jurassic Park"" movie. Audiences want to see these huge creatures tear people up, and I am with those people. The CGI is nice, and we get to see new dinosaurs like the Mosasaurus who refreshing and is good for marketing the movie. I can respect the fun that this movie is, but is hard to take seriously when you can see through the whole marketing gimmick that this movie is. I guess the gimmick worked though, $1.6 billion dollars later. If you want a brainless movie that doesn't provide much thought process, go for Jurassic World. I would just recommend re-watching it's predecessor, ""Jurassic Park"" to remind yourself the genius of Spielberg and not Trevorrow."
" A Jurassic Turkey
",2018-01-16 00:00:00,4,"Since the early '90's I've enjoyed the Jurassic Park novels and movies. Not only were they groundbreaking for their special effects but they were intelligent stories, which were well filmed and acted by a stellar cast. I even have to admit to enjoying the third film in the series, which a lot of people have put down. So, when I saw this episode was on the drawing board I was a happy bunny. However, when I saw the cast line up and the story synopsis I decided I'd wait until the film made it onto telly. Two years from the release and the movie is on... Boy, was I glad I waited(?) What the hell were the writers and director thinking of(?) There are so many holes in the story it leaks crap in the majority of scenes. The acting ranges from abysmal to average. And, the special effects appear to be below par for the time - the opening corvid shot is really horrendous.Poor Michael Crichton is turning in his grave.What the first three films showed was that Murphy's Law was more than prevalent on an island where dinosaurs roamed. So what do we find when the film starts(?) The park is open and has been running for a few years. You just know they've been lucky so far and that their luck is soon to run out. Then we learn the scientists are creating new ""Dinosaurs"" to keep the punters happy and spending their money. I can hear Malcolm screaming now, ""Will these idiots ever learn?"" - Evidently not Malcolm. Even worse is that on the other side of the island they're trying to train raptors. Though we're never really told why they're being trained, there is a military element which wants them as weapons (yawn, what else(?)...). I think it's because somebody had a great idea for a CGI scene later in the film... and this is the only way they could link it in.This leads me to the CGI Choreography because this is what it is. There are sometimes when it's just way too overcooked to be believable. The nannies, Zara's (Katie McGrath) dance of death is a particular case in subject. For me, this was just ludicrous and stupid.Back to the errors in the story, saying that there were no ""Dangerous"" animals on the island so the customers were never at risk was an outright lie. Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), who runs the island actually believes this, even though the latest creation, which she signed off on, is very dangerous... as well as the raptors... which she also knew about... then at the climax of the film... well, this is one woman you shouldn't trust - ever.One annoying thing, for me, was when Claire reprimands a colleague for wearing an antique Jurassic Park T-Shirt because it could be upsetting to the customers because people died there. The thing is, he never mingles with the vacationers. Secondly, the voice on the tannoy, at one point, actually welcomes everybody to Jurassic Park - Not Jurassic World!I also hated the kids in this film. A geek and a trainee stalker. At least with the original kids, Tim and Lex you could relate to them, this, on the whole, is because there were well written and well acted. Grey (Ty Simpkins) and Zack (Nick Robinson) are pretty two dimensional and boring, which can also be said for the rest of the cast, especially Claire. Only Chris Pratt, as Owen, and Vincent D'Onofrio, as Hoskins, give decent performances, though their characters are very cliched.This is one boring, seen it all before, cliche-ridden film that I'd not recommend to anyone - even if the end scene is quite entertaining. I'll not watch this again and I cannot believe there's a sequel in the pipeline."
" An exciting return-to-form for the series - there will be more!
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"'Jurassic World' (or Jurassic Park 4) is set 22 years after the original film (and 14 years after the last film), on the same Costa Rican island, with it now a fully-functioning theme park. Why anyone would open or invest in it after the events is another story altogether and never really mentioned! Owen (Pratt) is the Sam Neil replacement and is charming and solid throughout and Claire (Dallas Howard) is the Laura Dern replacement and becomes less stuck-up and annoying as the film progresses. Jake Johnson (Nick off 'New Girl') is great as the computer tech in the control room and gets a few funny moments - a more than admirable job as the Jeff Goldblum replacement!The film keeps a similar formula to 'Jurassic Park' - two kids, a concerned parent-figure (but not the actual parents - why are they never with their kids?), a dinosaur escaping and everyone running for their lives! There's some nice throwbacks to the original too - the score motifs, the kids stumble into the foyer of the memorable final scene, the original/distinctive jeeps are seen, Dr Wu - the geneticist - is played by the same actor, Hammond is mentioned a few times and there's a heard of Gallimimus at one point. I was glad to see more Stegosaurs and also to see Ankylosaurs for the first time in the series.My main issue was the similarity to some aspects of 'Jurassic Park III' - there's a dinosaur bigger than Tyrannosaurus Rex that kills everything; there's Pteranodons that get loose and their consequences never properly dealt with; and the Velociraptors aren't really treated as vicious killing machines until it's needed in the story. However, it doesn't really need to make much sense when there's so many great moments of tension, then action, then surprise throughout - and some genuine wonder with the Deinosuchus in the Sea World part. A well done final scene(s) cap off an enjoyable experience."
" Adventures and Actions!
",2018-01-01 00:00:00,8,"Jurassic World is American science fiction adventure film which was directed by Colin Trevorrow. This movie located in Costa Rica, the Jurassic World resort provides a habitat for a variety type of dinosaurs, including the very dangerous and intelligent hybrid dinosaur named Indominus Rex. In the movie, the hybrid dinosaur escapes from its cage which causes the other dinosaurs to avoid and create a violent disruption in the resort. It was up to the former military and animal expert Chris Pratt to use his unique skills to save the two young brothers and the rest of the tourists in the resort. I like how the movie has extreme close up looks and loud sounds which makes the film more fun to watch. For example- when the militaries went to the jungle to look for that Indominus Rex, they couldn't find that dinosaur at first because they didn't know that dinosaur can camouflage. When the Indominus Rex appeared in front of them, the camera was extremely close to that dinosaur's face. Overall, I enjoyed the movie. The director Colin Trevorrow did an excellent job to create this film. He provided a unique plot, angles, sound, shots, lighting, etc. The actors did an outstanding job with their roles and contribution. Also, the director was successful to help the actors act their parts better. I would recommend this movie to people who enjoy adventures and actions."
" Jurasic for a new generation
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,7,"The lives of everybody at Jurasic World are in grave peril when a genetically modified dinosaur - monster - escapes and embarks on a rampage of death and destruction. Very impressive special effects and plenty of action make this great viewing, though it may prove a little too scary for younger children. I am older enough to remember the original Jurasic Park but good to see the series given new blood for a new generation."
" FANTASTIC sequel to a franchise that I absolutely support and LOVE!
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,8,"I was hyped out of my mind when the first teaser for Jurassic World came out in 2014 and while me being a huge fan of the franchise, I just had to go see this movie with my Mom and my sister. We went a couple weeks after the movie was released and it was possibly the greatest IMAX experience ever! I loved almost every minute and every second of Jurassic World and although it's not as good as the first Jurassic Park, I think it's equal to The Lost World which I also enjoyed. When we ere sitting in the theatre, I was already hyped when the Universal logo popped up on screen and that may tell you that I am a huge fan of the Jurassic Park Franchise and I love all of the movies minus Jurassic Park III which i'm not a huge fan of, but it's ok. And I had a BLAST with Jurassic World and I think the idea of adding the new hybrid The Indominus rex is genius! The story really hooked and caught my attention, the CGI was good enough, but I really think they should've added more animatronics and that would've improved the film because in this movie you will find A LOT of CGI and a very little amount of animatronics. The actors Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard were great! They're not as great as Sam Neil or Laura Dern from the first Jurassic Park, but they still are very good actors who play as very interesting characters known as Owen and Claire and their performances are really good in this film as well as the kids who are played by Nick Robinson and Ty Sympkins. Jurassic World really surprised me! In fact, it surprised everyone in my theatre. After the movie was over and the credits were rolling, the audience was clapping and I have NEVER in my life of any movie theatre experienced that kind of feeling and I felt very happy when I left the theatre. Jurassic World is a great sequel even it does not live up to the original,I respect it for what it is and I'm proud to be a fan of this franchise and i'm gonna give Jurassic World a 9.5/10."
" Another remake, but that's not all bad
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,6,"Perhaps someday we will genetically recreate dinosaurs, but - in the meantime - we can simply recreate Spielberg films. The cute kids from a broken home. The speeches about nature finding a way. Clearly, you have seen this movie before. But it is still totally entertaining 20 years later, and Chris Pratt is totally becoming an unlikely movie star. I would not say the movie is ""good,"" but it ain't bad."
" if its not broken dont fix it part deux
",2017-12-24 00:00:00,1,"Btw, every person reviewing this movie should be mind blown that the imbd staff rated this movie a 7.2. Please tell me i'm not the only person that thinks they are getting checks from chris pratt himself. i mean only 48 staff members voted, either they are getting paid to raise this rating or i should be a staff member because there's a large group of people that suck at their job."
" cheesy dino movie
",2017-12-24 00:00:00,1,"Its like the old saying goes. If its not broken don't fix it. Nothing will ever beat the original. They need to leave this franchise alone. The entire story line of Owen (chris Pratt) being some kind of velociraptor whisperer is so cheesy. They are trying to make the velociraptor into some kind of pet dog you can train. Who ever is Chris Pratts manager should get paid almost as much as him, because all i see when i look at him is the goofy guy from parks and rec, not a dino trainer, how he got this gig blows my mind, congrats."
" GREAT!
",2017-12-21 00:00:00,7,"This looked great! It was visually exciting and had a good story line (not perfect). The humour didn't ruin any of the moments and there wan't too much of it.However there were a few moments were i found myself thinking 'really' and others were the logic being shown by the main characters were non existant.I also felt that as the movie progressed that some of the characters got lost in the story, particularly Gray, but otherwise a great movie."
" Satisfied.
",2017-12-16 00:00:00,7,"I got de ja vu there. There are two kids lost in a dysfunctional park full of dinosaurs who happen to be related to the rich person who runs it? Hmm...But it was suspenseful and worth theorizing about. But I still won't get over ""Verizon Wireless presents..."""
" Satisfying 4th installment to the JP series
",2017-12-16 00:00:00,8,"""Jurassic World"" is the 4th installment in the Jurassic Park film series, and while it does not live up to the original, it works as a satisfying sequel to the original. However, this is also the best Jurassic Park sequel (as of today at least). The effects are great, and there are several new and returning dinosaurs from the original. The Indominus Rex is a really cool creation that I really liked. Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong), however, is the only returning human character from the original.This movie introduces us to Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), who are solid Jurassic Park characters. The movie still has a ""Jurassic Park"" feel to it even with these new and modern characters. However, they do some really dumb things at times. What is shooting at a huge hybrid dino with a small hunting rifle going to do? And why get into your vehicle to phone HQ instead of at the paddock control room? Oh, well. Overall, this was a solid film in the series, and I have enjoyed it several times. You should watch it, and give it a chance. 8/10"
" Top Review is Shill Nonsense
",2017-12-04 00:00:00,3,This is NOT a good movie.IMO this is the worst of all of them. The plot is nonsense. The CGI is over the top and takes you out of any kind of immersion.The ending is predictable. The characters are bland. There isn't much you can redeem from this movie. I guess some of the ties to the original location is alright. Jake Johnson is cool
" Jurassic World is a fun, entertaining popcorn thriller with enjoyable cast performances and great Visuals.
",2017-11-12 00:00:00,8,"Jurassic World: Movie Review.Jurassic World is a funny, enjoyable and entertaining summer thriller ride movie with terrifically spectacular visuals CGI with strong performances by Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard and fine direction by Colin Trevorrow.The direction of Colin Trevorrow is good, but also leaves room for lot of improvements. The action sequences and visual tone and style of the movie is fantastic. The movie looks great visually. Dinosaurs are created beautifully and they looks really amazing. The last 30 minutes of the movie was awesome especially the climatic fight scene.However, Jurassic World lacks in the terms of story, script, screenplay and character development. The film also has some very irritating and boring characters, and the sometimes the plot seems to be rushed off and little bit off, and falls behind in the terms of tension, intensity and story build than the first original Jurassic Park movie, but all over the movie lives up to its expectations in some aspects and is appealing in its visual style and character performances. It's a worthy contender and much better Jurassic Ride since the original movies.(Please Note: That This Review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film, and does not represent others. Thank You)."
" Another piece of modern trash.
",2017-11-01 00:00:00,3,"There is a young, handsome (I suspect), super skillful man, a charismatic guru. There is a young, pretty woman, a bit retarded and limited in her interests, often career-oriented. Monsters comes, people die, only a handsome superhero can save a day. A girl changes her shoes and/or shirt and becomes a superwoman in about 30 seconds, instantly gets expertise in gymnastics, combat, weapons handling, strategy and kills monsters together with a handsome guru (although the monsters had no problem with killing 1000 heavily armed troopers. Or maybe it is all that eating that made monsters slower?).The above is a screenplay for most of action/adventure/SF movies during the last 5-10 years. Doesn't matter if it is a new episode of Star Wars, or Jurassic Park, or Aliens, or some Passengers, or Interstellar - there are some superficial, cosmetic changes, but when I watch it all I can see no differences. It can be set in a jungle or in space, the clothes differ, the monsters can be humans, maybe there is a slight change in the roles played. But there is never any depth, no real personalities, no emotions, no basic logic. It is just colorful, fast, shimmering and loud. Am I getting older? Perhaps. If so, I am really happy and proud that I am not young if it means that I would have to have a brain capable of enjoying such a crap."
" There is a plus...
",2017-10-29 00:00:00,2,"... and it's dinosaurs. Absolutely everything else is a big pile of crap (might be dinosaurs'). So full of clichés, you exactly know, who is going to die or who will live just a few minutes after knowing the character. So many absurd decisions, so many stupid but predictable actions. So much staring on danger in spite of running out. So many substantive errors for anyone who has primary science knowledge. And last but not least running many hours in the jungle on heels without absolutely any problems. Unfortunately dinosaurs haven't eaten everyone so it's going to be another idiotic movie."
" A lot of call backs to the original
",2017-10-27 00:00:00,9,"If you haven't seen the first film, an idiot billionaire wanted to make a theme park/zoo of live dinosaurs. What could go wrong? Well, Jurassic World takes that concept up to 11. The Computer Generated dinosaurs are passable at best. This movie tries to recapture the magic of the original, but it's really difficult. The biggest problem is that there's a lot of suspension of disbelief. After the numerous deaths and a freaking T-Rex slaughtering people in a city, it's hard to imagine anyone would touch the ""Jurassic Park"" concept with a ten foot pole. Not only that, it would be impossible to get insurance on such a theme park/zoo. The T-Rex attack on a city in ""Lost World"" would be the disastrous equivalent of September 11th or Pearl Harbor in the Jurassic Park universe. There's just no way there could ever be a ""Jurassic World"". It's just too much of a liability."
" Jurassic World--and excellent sequel
",2017-10-26 00:00:00,8,"The Original 3 Star Wars films were super.The sequels, that were really prequels, were junk.Star Trek was great when it kept moving forward, when it started going backward in the story line it became junk too.Jurassic World--you have a good original story, and now a sequel that truly goes forward in the story time line in great style.Jurassic world is a terrific movie. It's loaded with tributes to the original film of more than 20 years ago. When you hear John William's majestic score, it paints beautiful images and moods in you. However, this story moves forward. And it does so in a tremendous production. All of the performers are excellent in their roles. Even the dinosaurs perform better. There is a human to dino sequence in this film that will bring most to tears. There are other creature to human relationships that are fascinating. And of course there are other meetings of the species that will terrify you. As with most sequels, the formula is known before the opening credits even begin. There will be monsters, screaming, death and destruction. But how it's packaged is extremely entertaining.I have seen so many films in my life that I, admittedly, am growing numb to them. But I found Jurassic World very watchable. Actually, it was so good, I've seen it quite a few times and I've enjoyed each experience.This is a good one!"
" So you've opened a park with Dinosaurs in it, did you guys not see the first three movies?
",2017-10-23 00:00:00,7,"Jurassic World I've got to say that I really enjoyed Jurassic World. Being a huge fan of the original movie and with enough time passed to eradicate the painful memories left by Jurassic Park 3 I was really excited for this latest installment. With a promising cast and after an exciting trailer I sat on the edge of my cinema seat in anticipation. An attempt is made to try and recapture some of the original movies magic. JW manages a little but ultimately cannot live up to the greatness of Spielberg's classic. There's the rousing theme tune accompanied by an altogether equally uplifting new score by Michael Giacchino (John Williams was too busy doing the Force Awakens to return for this one) and there's some supremely polished CGI.If you aren't familiar with the plot on this one here goes. In JW a fully operational theme park is now up and running and has been successful for quite some years now. After the events in the first three movies you would have thought someone would have realised that this isn't such a good idea. However public interest is beginning to dwindle as your average Joe Bloggs is getting bored with regular old dinosaurs. So the science boffins are asked to come up with a new dinosaur. Something bigger, scarier, cooler and with more teeth. This is where this movie starts to fall down. I'm sorry but I may visit the zoo once in a while but never once have I been bored by seeing a lion or giraffe. There on the TV all the time too but never have they been boring. So Im sure a real live dinosaur would blow my socks off. Anyway a new dino is cooked up in the lab. Indominus Rex. An hybrid creature with a set of uncanny abilities and some nasty big teeth. As you've guessed it. The beast escapes, tourists get eaten and we have our new Jurassic Park movie.As entertaining as all this is the movie stumbles because of its own dumbness. If only the script writers would have taken a bit more care over proceedings and we would have had an even better movie. An example being is when the containment team are sent in to retrieve the escaped creature. They merely turn up in a couple of jeeps with a cattle prod and a net! How were they planning on getting the gargantuan monster back to it's pen? I say monster because as Chris Pratt's character says ""she's no dinosaur!"" So because the containment team are a group of stupid individuals they all get eaten. The films big finale is super entertaining but equally as dumb. Our heroes are in peril and about to get devoured by one big dinosaur so their genius plan to help save them is to let out another big dinosaur. Oh dear now you're surrounded by two big dinosaurs! I'm Knit picking here guys because despite the films silliness I thoroughly enjoyed every moment.Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard were great together. Vincent D'Onofrio was a great villainous character, even if his motive to weaponise Velociraptors was another one of the movies stupid ideas. Irrfan Kahn's character was likable and had integrity but he couldn't fly an helicopter for toffee! Direction and cinematography was good. CGI as you'd expect is second to none. If you're watching on Blu-ray the HD transfer and sound quality is superb. An excellent tester disc for any surround sound system. I gave JW 8/10. Now that's a high score for a dumb movie but sometimes the simple ""take your brain out"" movies are the best. Relax, dumb down and enjoy. Oh and if something chases you...Run!!!"
" I love this movie more please
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,10,"This movie was incredible. I have to admit I have never seen any of the Jurrasic Park movies and when they came on TV I got scared when I was younger. I have to say this movie with Chris Pratt was incredible, I couldn't believe it took me two years to see this movie because of how scared I was when I was 15 but now I am 17 and I am not scared.Wheather if you have grown up with the Jurrasic Park movies or not I can guarantee you this that you will love this movie.I hope the sequel to this movie which is coming out next year is successful like this movie is."
" That's one big pile of dinosaur doodoo...
",2017-10-07 00:00:00,1,"Walked out on the movie when it came out, a miserable pile of dinosaur vomit! Now it popped out with a 7-star score?! No ! This movie deserves to be rated as low as Emoji Movie. A shameless play on your nostalgia, the worst Jurassic Park movie of all by far. Oh yeah IMDb your latest reviews for this movie are from spam bots, every review has the same title and all from MV, CA with some weird usernames that are almost the same. Starting to doubt this website more and more."
" Bryce Dallas Howard
",2017-10-07 00:00:00,6,"I picked up this movie because I did like the first one at the time I was studying computers, and because I was bored a little. What I discovered is Bryce Dallas Howard.As soon as she appeared in a scene, I had a hard time concentrating on the story, that pathetically resembles the first one. Her delicate complexion, low voice, big eyes and chiseled features stole all the thunder from the elaborate, sometime downright ridiculous dinosoroid contraptions. I almost forgot about the annoying older kid and longed for her return on screen, sweaty and brave.A must if you are a refined redheads aficionado. Also if you are an unconditional of the first movie, since this is essentially a remake. Oh, I absolutely love Laura Dern, but seeing Bryce Dallas Howard in this movie was redemption to me."
" This was someone's idea of a joke, right ??
",2017-10-04 00:00:00,3,"If the hour and a half I saw is an indication, then I'm glad I didn't see every minute of this one...Frankly, I can only presume that all those 10 ratings came as a result of one or two reasons...either someone paid a bunch of people to praise this disaster, or some of them never saw the original, or the sequels...Very very bland, for a supposed honor to one of the best movies ever...in the time I was watching, there were only 10 minutes of a dinosaur, or two. Perhaps it is the first hour that has all the exciting action everybody else is talking about, but I saw the last 2/3 of it and it was a big yawn for me...And what's with the riding around the island on motorcycles...and who thought up using raptors as hound dogs, to find the T-rex they apparently lost, heh heh...Truly, there is little to praise JW for...certainly not a coherent story, nor the mediocre acting...even the CGI was not up to par with the originals...it just turned out to be a nothing movie..."
" Thrilling and rousing sequel in which a genetically engineered hybrid Tiranosaurus goes berserk and carries out a killing spree
",2017-09-28 00:00:00,7,"New chapter subsequently to the famous trilogy that gives exciting , sweeping fun and entertainment provided by giant animals made by means of incredible combination of computer generator -ILM, Industrial Light Magic- and Animatronics models . The Dinosaurs , Tiranosaurus and Velociraptors are the real protagonists , they're terrifyingly awesome and almost completely convincing . This original ideal is based on Michael Crichton's novel and writing credits by David Koepp adapted by screen-writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver ; in addition , the story idea for this film was created by Steven Spielberg and Mark Protosevich to confer the notion of doing another installment in the Jurassic Park franchise . The picture starts on Isla Nublar , a small island 120 miles off the coast of Costa Rica , a group of construction workers and animal handlers , and security guards watch the creature within unseen . There are living dinosaurs and various prehistoric creatures genetically engineered by means of DNA cloned extracted from Jurassic animals found in mosquitoes preserved into amber from cretaceous period . It happens 22 years after the original Jurassic Park failed , the new park also known as Jurassic World where Dinos were allowed mix freely and to breed and it is opened for amusement and business . After years of studying genetics the scientists on the park genetically engineer a new breed of dinosaur has been created , being a new hybrid ""attraction"" . During the process , the animal tries to escape , an act which leads to a mass panic , and the death of one of the workers . Meanwhile , the workaholic and stiff-upper-lip manager Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard , Ron Howard's daughter) has two unexpected visitors , her nephews Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins) in the park, but she is too busy to give attention to them and asks her assistant to escort the children . And the dedicated worker Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) , helped by Barry (Omar Sy) , is training four Velociraptors and the InGen security guard Vic Hoskins , a greedy man with mean purports (Vincent D'Onofrio) , thinks of these wild animals can be trained for military use . The park attraction in property the Indian magnate Masrani (Irrfan Khan) ; as Jurassic Park's owner brings to various genetic experts (B.D. Wong) and other scientific people to practice embryos and other weird experiments . Later on , during an inspection , a security agent disables the security system so that he can make his surveillance , this enables a huge dinosaur to escape the enclosure . Then , the theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur : ¨Indominus Rex"" , it means ""Fierce/Untamed King"" in Latin , after the hybrid dinosaur's erratically destructive and murderous nature that exhibits to run amok against the tourists . Then , the two kiddies escape through the park in a Gyrosphere featured in the resort tour , being pursued by the carnivorous animal and things go awry . This is an agreeable entry , plenty of spine-tingler thrills , chills , emotion and lots of fun . Interesting and enjoyable premise about DNA of a prehistoric dinosaur taken from an ancient insect and subsequent scientist experiments leading a extremely lethal creature is wonderfully developed . Humans try desperately to escape of dinosaurs and they are chased through leafy jungle by fanged giant animals , specially by the Tyrannosaurus and of course by attack of the Velociraptors . Simple dialog and plain tale , but the story is very exciting and inventive . In the film appears numerous predator animals and colossal carnivores as Tyrannosaurus Rex , Velociraptors, Pterodactilos , Behemoths , Spinosaurious , Stegosauruses , Gallimimus stampede , although most of creatures are large herbivores harmless and feed on vegetables as large dinosaurs , triceratops and Brachiosaurius accompanied by a herd of Parasaurolophus . Along with a Mosasaurus that shows up soaking a lot of extras in the bleacher section and eating a shark but suggested that when the animal grabs the shark that the whole bleacher section submerge underwater using a hydraulic system so that the audience will be able to see the Mosasaurus feeding underwater . In fact , the prehistoric animals are truly the film stars , they are terrifyingly awful and create abundant and quite potent screams and scares . There're also some stirring and exciting scenes where the actors give vigorous physical performances . Magnificent FX totally convincing are for combination of models and computer animation from Industrial , Light and Magic of George Lucas , as well as Phil Tippett effects returning to crew duties as Dinosaur Supervisor, reprising his role from the original film. . As always spectacular music by Michael Giacchino , replacing John Williams , and music in the trailer is a rendition of 'John Williams' original theme , this marks the first ""Jurassic"" film for Michael Giacchino ; and excellent and colorful cinematography by John Schwartzman . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Colin Trevorrow . Rating : Above average , well worth watching . Other entries of this fantastic saga are the followings : ¨Jurassik park¨ by Steven Spileberg followed by ¨Lost world¨ directed again by Spielberg and ¨Jurassik Park III¨ by Joe Johnston . After Jurassic World became the fourth highest grossing film of all time, Jurassic World 2 was announced for 2018 , being directed by J.A. Bayona . The film will appeal to teenagers and grown-up , but no for small kids by violent , realistic and gory attacks by monsters animals."

I love how they put the movie on a new island called Isla Nublar.i also like how gray and zach found the old island cars.The main characters of this movie were:Owen,Claire,Gray,Zach,Blue,and the Indominus Rex. I don't think that they messed up at all with their acting i think they were spot on with their acting.I liked a lot about the movie like the fighting and the suspense it had i also like how it gets your heart pumping and it also get your adrenaline pumping too.This movie is a PG movie.But i would only recommend it to certain ages from 8 to about 45 years old i would only recommend it to these these people because of some of the scenes like the killing and kissing."

",2017-09-20 00:00:00,6,"""Jurassic world"" Movie Review Jurassic world is a really good movie with, Action Adventure and a Si-if movie with Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Ty SimkinsJurassic world took place in Isla Nublar the main characters are Owen Claire Masrani Hoskins And Greg and the movie is about a new theme park, built on the original site of Jurassic Park, creates a genetically modified hybrid dinosaur, which escapes containment and goes on a killing spree. I think the cast did really well on the movie. The only person that i don't think did well was Claire because it was unrealistic because she was running with heels on. Some of the things i liked about Jurassic world was the ending. And some of things i didn't like was when Owen and the police officers went into the dinosaur's cage because it is stupid to do that and when the police officers where tring to hide they hid behind the cars instead of under them. One thing i learned was to not to run away from your aunt or who ever is watching you because they could've gotten killed or hurt. And i don't know what others could've learned from this. \I would recommend it to sifi fans and people who love dinosaurs. I would recommend it to dinosaur lovers. I wouldn't recommend it to people who don't like dinosaurs. The rating is p-13. I think it is a good movie but not the best and out of 5 stars i give it a 3.50."

I rate this movie 10 out of 10.The movies starts off as taking a roadtrip to jurassic world and the two boys Zach and Gray go to a museum of dinosaurs and experience a lot of stuff.After the museum the boys go on this crazy awesome ride to see actual dinosaurs but when they run into the biggest problem.getting stuck in the forest with the biggest dinosaur of all times!So i do really think that you should watch this movie if you haven't already.You'll love it if you like history about dinosaurs.And this movie is rated PG so anyone could watch it.This is totally a family movie.Grab some popcorn and prepare to roar abouts this movie!"

Its talks about dinosaurs and the genetics ability and what they are able to do and how strong they are .The best aspects of ""Jurassic World,"" in which a hybrid super-predator runs amok in the trouble-plagued theme park, are so good that they transport you that exhilarating mental space where the series' original director, steven spielberg, raised a tentpole back in 1993. The worst aspects are bad indeed: thin characterizations, a blase attitude toward human-on- animal violence and a weird male-supremacist streak that comes close to sneering at unmarried career women who don't have kids.Set 22 years after the events of Jurassic Park, Jurassic World takes place on the same fictional Central American island of Isla nublar, off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, where a theme park populated with cloned dinosaurs has operated for ten years.Chris Pratt as Owen Grady, a Navy veteran, and a raptor expert and trainer at Jurassic World.Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire Dearing, the in this movie about genetic dinosaurs and what dinosaurs can do and how strong dinosaurs are. Also i learned what are dinosaurs able to do and not to do. Others will learns science and genetic dinosaurs. Jurassic World operations manager. Also Aunt to Zach and Gray Mitchell.Vincent D'Onofrio as Vic Hoskins, head of InGen's security operations, who wants to use the one of Claire's nephews and the older brother of Gray.Omar Sy as Barry, Owen's assistant who helps care for the raptors. B. D. Wong as Dr. Henry Wu, a geneticist who heads the team that created the dinosaur for Jurassic World.Irrfan Khan as Simon Masrani, CEO of the Masrani Corporation and the owner of Jurassic World.The starting scene when Chris Pratt saves a boy who falls in the cage , Chris Pratt is very dashing hero. I like that claire let the big dinosaur go and the 2 dinosaurs fought and he won on scene 18. I learned a lot of scienceThe group of people i would recommend it to kids, action gos, people that like dinosaurs,and romantic lovers. People that like comedy,and people that don't like seeing people getting killed. The MPAA rating for this movie is PG-13. I think the movie overall it's a good movie. I rated this movie a B+. I loved chris pratt he is a really good actor and hero."

",2017-09-19 00:00:00,9,"""Does This Dino Make Jurassic World Look Big?!""Stop, listen, and watch! You've probably seen a billion dinosaur movies and probably tired of them. Maybe one movie based on dinosaurs got your attention. The movie that caught your attention was probably ""Jurassic World"". I mean let's face it this movie has everything from action to romance! ""Jurassic World"" is an action romance movie with a science twist. Hello and welcome to the somewhat tragic yet exciting movie review!Let's start off with the basic things about this movie. After seeing this movie i'm thinking where is this place it's beautiful! Jurassic World is located at a fictional Central American island of Isla Nublar, off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, and takes place 22 years after Jurassic Park. Claire, Owen, and Hoskins are 3 of the main characters. Zach and Gray are what I call secondary main characters. Their role in the movie is what causes a chain event that affects the story line of the movie. In the movie a ginormous man- made dinosaur gets loose and terrorizes the whole place. The ""Indominus Rex"" is a man eating dinosaur that the main characters try to stop. I thought all actors/ actresses did a great job showing fear and concern. Next we will be talking about the good and bad parts of the movie. My favorite scene from the movie was when they thought the dinosaur escaped. When Owen noticed claw marks on the wall he went with 2 other people to investigate only to find the dinosaur was in the cage with them! Owen escapes but the other 2 workers were not so lucky. As Owen escapes the Indominus Rex escapes with him leading on to the next scene. My least favorite scene was when Hoskins uses the raptors to try to defeat the Indominus Rex. As he takes over the company, he lets out the raptors resulting to many people dead. One lesson I learned from this movie is to always have a backup plan. When the first plan of containing the dinosaur didn't work they somehow always had another plan. A moral somebody might take from this movie might be to be optimistic because if no one was optimistic enough the dinosaur might've done much more than injure people.This movie overall would be great for anyone to watch. Although if you think dinosaurs, science, romance, and action is a waste of time then this movie isn't really for you, is it? I would recommend this movie to people that are into a little bit of some genres. Romance, action, nature, and science will perfectly describe what genres this movie is. If you into that I totally recommend ""Jurassic World"" to you! Of course every movie has an age rating, ""Jurassic World"" is rated PG- 13. It does have some foul language but overall I give this movie 9 out of 10 non squashed tomatoes ;)!"
" Jurassic World
",2017-09-19 00:00:00,10,"I recently saw the fictional movie, Jurassic World. In my opinion, the movie was very interesting and got me more attracted to dinosaurs. It was a very action packed movie and had a pinch of romance towards the end. Of course, the movie is about prehistoric animals, but this is different. Scientists have created a new, genetic hybrid that is very intelligent, very... strategic. This got me very attracted to different genetics and how they work. The story takes place on the fictional, Isla Nublar, in Central America. This movie takes place 22 years after the old theme park, Jurassic Park. The main characters are Grey, Zach, Claire, Owen, and Barry. I feel like all of the actors and actresses did a good job playing their role. The story is about ancient dinosaurs that were resurrected and brought back to our generation. Scientists create a whole new and intelligent dinosaur in this movie. What I liked about the movie is that there were dinosaurs, and it had a very smooth animation for them. I didn't like that the new genetic hybrid was so mean and dangerous. I learned that everything is not what it seems. The genetic hybrid seems to be a normal and slightly dangerous dinosaur in the beginning, but towards the middle of the story, it shows what it really is. I feel like others will learn that things are easier said than done. It's not easy to kill a dinosaur, after all. People that are looking for action and adventure should really watch this movie. People in those kinds of groups most likely will enjoy this movie, so I really recommend it. I wouldn't recommend this movie to people who dislike blood and action. This movie is rated PG-13, so it's best for younger viewers not to watch. This movie is really amazing! I rate it an A+ for it's awesomeness."

",2017-09-19 00:00:00,9,"Everyone remembers dinosaurs and how they became instinct.In this movie, there is a park filled all different kinds of dinosaurs.Colin Trevorrow the director of the movie should of made some actors get eaten such as Chris Pratt.The movie still good at least,but the acting was fine.The movie Jurassic World was made 2015,it was made in Hawaii.The main cast in the story were Chris Pratt(Owen),Bryce Dallas Howard(Claire),Vincent D'Onofrio(Hoskins),Ty Simpkins(Gray),and Nick Robinson(Zack).I think that the actors did pretty good for acting sometimes the movie wouldn't make sense there's parts that actors should of got eaten easily.The actors that I thought that had good acting was Ty Simpkins,Bryce Dallas Howard,and Nick Robinson.The reason why I didn't choose the other actors such as Chris Pratt is because they were not even that scared.I liked the movie still even if didn't like any of the cast some of the cast i mean.What i just learned from this movie is that check before you say.The reason why i liked this movie is because the action and some of the acting.So I liked this movie because of action and acting.I would recommend this movie to people that like dinosaurs and action.I wouldn't recommend this movie to people that don't like dinosaurs and action.The movie MPAA rating is PG-13.The movie to some people.Scale of 1-5 4 out of 5"
" Jurassic World
",2017-09-19 00:00:00,10,"The movie ""Jurassic World"" Is a really good movie. When I first saw the beginning of the movie interesting because I love action movies some scenes had romantic,funny,and kind of scary parts. I like the movie a lot I would watch it over and over again. Set 22 years after the events of Jurassic Park, Jurassic World takes place on the same fictional Central American island of Isla Nublar, off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, where a theme park populated with cloned dinosaurs has operated for ten years. The main characters in this movie are Chris Pratt:Owen,Bryce Dallas Howard:Claire,Ty Simpkins:Gray,Nick Robinson:Zach,and Jake Johnson:Lowery. The story is about how dinosaurs act in real life like the Raptors hunt and kill things. The Indominus T-Rex eats a lot of thing like other dinosaurs,plants,buildings,and people. I think that Chris Pratt:Owen did a good job in the movie because he did a good job with the dinosaurs and working with the people. I think that Katie McGrath:Zara didn't do a good job because the had her talking on the phone and she never payed attention to things. I liked the part where they were Owen and the raptors were fitting the Indominus T-Rex and the raptors were protecting Owen,Clare,Gray,and Zach. The lesson I learned is to be careful of what i do because then everything will go wrong.To be careful of what the do or say because something will go bad.I would tell people that like romance,action,and dinosaurs to watch the movies. I would recommend this to people that are into science and dinosaurs. I would not recommended this to people that dislike action. The MPAA rating of this move The movie ""Jurassic World"" Is a really good movie. When I first saw the beginning of the movie interesting because I love action movies."

",2017-09-19 00:00:00,8,"Bringing extinct animals back to life like mammoths, dinosaurs, passenger pigeons, etc may sound like a thing of the future but it is actually a closer reality to us than you think. Thanks to -------------- and the likes of Jurassic Park and world this idea has been brought to light and somewhat normalized. In this ""sequel"" to ""Jurassic World"" we are introduced to a new theme park built 22 years after the original ""Jurassic Park"" failed and introduces us to a new dinosaur that backfires horribly.Set 20 years after the original ""Jurassic Park"" a new theme park opens on the original site of the old park. When the parks visitors starts declining, the scientist think of a new genetically modified dinosaur to showcase but everything starts to backfire horribly. We focus on the storyline of Claire, Owen, and her two nephews Zach and Gray as they fight for survival,battle against dinosaurs and deal with the evil Hoskins The movie was absolutely amazing in my opinion. It had a bit of comedy, some thrill, action, and mainly(of course) scifi! I'm pretty sure for anyone that grew up on watching the original ""Jurassic Parks"" was hit with a wave of nostalgia watching ""Jurassic World"" and were probably even hit with more nostalgia with the little easter eggs from the movie.If you're a thrill seeker, into sci fi, enjoy action, or really love dinosaurs then I highly suggest going to see ""Jurassic World"". The pg-13 rating might be a bummer for some parents that were excited to go take their little ones to go see it but I think you should still go take kids to see it, there's only a tad bit of profanity and some gore every now and then. Overall, I give this movie a 8/10 rating and would highly recommend it."

When everything goes horribly wrong.What I had liked about this movie is that how an aunt is trying to get closer to her nephews but also trying to not/stop a killing dinosaur.What some people may not like about like about this movie is that how all the dinosaurs are killing and hurting innocent people.what I can learn from this movie is that to be careful with science experiments and when trying to create something using different types of genes.Another thing that people can learn from is that to also be careful with the animals you mess and play around with.This movie is a PG-13 movie,but it is a good movie for people to watch.The group of people that would like this movie is action lovers and sci-fi lovers.This movie is good and it had became my favorite movie and I think a lot of people would like and love this movie like me.Scale of 1-5 I will give it a 4½-5"

",2017-09-19 00:00:00,10,"On the day June 12, 2015, this day there was an action-packed movie was released named Jurassic world. I think that it was a satisfying and informational movie because if you are supposed to do an essay on dinosaurs this movie will be helpful, also it is satisfying because it was funny and had a lot of action. In my opinion, i think it was a good movie.This place in the movie was on an island called Isla nublar. I think that they did it on an island because they did not want any of the dinos to escape from the park. This movie took place in Costa Rica and came out in the united states.I liked this movie because it kind of gives you a picture in your mind the only part that I didn't like is when they thought that the dino escaped. The lesson that I learned doesn't make something that you don't know what it will do. I think that others will learn not to do something stupid.I know that paleontologist will like this movie because it includes dinosaurs and paleontologists study dinosaurs. The rating of this movie is pg-13. It is a good movie. It is a good movie. The score of the movie would be a 95%.Its grade would be an A-.The stars would be ****. 4 out of 5."
" Jurassic World
",2017-09-19 00:00:00,8,"Everyone remembers the story where dinosaurs use to exist. Perhaps you have heard/Seen the movie ""Jurassic Park"" or the new one ""Jurassic World"". This story is about a group of scientists who made ""Jurassic World"" and they genetically created a modified Dinosaur killing intelligent machine! That manages to break free and camouflage to hide from the scientists and then eat them. So the scientist's and a boy named Grey are on a trip with his brother Zach to Jurassic World but didn't know there was a outbreak.So basically the whole start of the story is Zachary ""Zach"" Mitchell is a teenage boy who was present for the incident at Jurassic World, with his younger brother, Gray. He is the older son of Karen and Scott, as well as the older nephew of Claire Dearing, the Park Operations Manager of Jurassic World.Gray Mitchell is the younger brother of Zach, as well as the son of Karen and Scott and the nephew of Claire Dearing. Jurassic World took place at A marvelous place called Jurassic Park it took place in 1990 Claire Dearing is the park operations manager of Jurassic World, the younger sister of Karen Mitchell, the sister-in-law of Scott Mitchell and the aunt of Zach and Gray. Owen Grady is a dinosaur researcher employed by Jurassic World, and one of two main protagonists in Jurassic World, the other being Claire Dearing. He conducts a behavioral research on Velociraptors. Personally In my opinion Owen was a really good actor in Jurassic World and so Was Aunt Claire Gray did a pretty good job too it was intense in the movie and Zach was always the Hero in the movie, For example he jump started the Truck. The stuff I liked about Jurassic World was it was intense and dangerous and I felt sad and maybe I cried when the raptor part but you won't see me cry unless i'm really hurt. But the character I hated the most was Dr. Hoskins he is evil. The lesson I learned from this movie is don't mess with nature and or modify it otherwise we are all dead. I think others will learn not to trust their Aunt because Aunt Claire messed up she almost killed everyone with just a stupid modified dinosaur.The group of people I think would like this movie are adventure seekers maybe kids 8 Or 9 and adults but otherwise it's pretty intense and I would not"

I would recommend this to somebody who likes Dinosaurs,Chris Pratt, Colin Trevorrow(Star Wars),Action, Adventure,Sci-Fi and is a big fan of Jurassic Park.The special effects were stunning.This movie was definitely Action- Packed.Jurassic World is the 4th highest-grossing film of all time and Jurassic Park 24th highest-grossing film of all time. Brothers Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gary (Ty Simpkins) go to this island to go see their aunt Claire(Bryce Dallas Howard),who happens to be the park's manager,Since Claire is a busy woman she assigns her assistant Zara (Katie McGrath)to escort them through the island but eventually ditch her. While exploring the island by themselves they get on a ride and enter a restricted area.The Indominus Rex comes and destroys their sphere but, their manage to escape.They go to this shack what use to be the Jurassic Park visitor center and repair this old jeep. While the boys are driving the car Claire and Owen ( Chris Pratt), a trainer and raptor expert helps Claire find the boys. Hoskins(Vincent D'Onofrio)( enemy of Jurassic World) wants to use Owen's dinosaurs and the Indominus Rex as military weapons. All the Actors and Actresses did a really good job.When my mom watched the movie she said that Claire doesn't get dirty with her dress but, I don't know what she means she gets messy.I just don't know how she survive that with heels the whole time?!I noticed something that I bet a lot of people didn't notice wouldn't notice. Claire calls Grey, Ty (the actor's real name)when they get off the truck. I also noticed that when Claire and Owen hide from the I. Rex Owen leaves his rifle by the truck , the dinosaur shakes the truck and his rifle is there unmoved. Claire picks up Zach's broken phone before that Zach put his phone in his pocket. Why is Claire's hair color always changing? This movie taught me not to mess with Mother Nature and don't control nature. Animals shouldn't be used as military weapons. Teamwork and bravery are also used.I would recommend this to somebody who likes Dinosaurs,Chris Pratt, Colin Trevorrow(Star Wars),Action, Adventure,Sci-Fi and a big fan of Jurassic Park. I would not recommend this to people who like horror, Western(although i don't know if thats still a thing) romance,comedy or princessy girls. The movie is rated PG-13 because the violence and language,but I think mature kids can watch it. I give it a 4 out of 5 .Overall the movie AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!"
" Jurassic World
",2017-09-19 00:00:00,10,"The movie was about scientist making new dinosaurs out of different DNA.What i have seen is that the scientist are trying to make people be interested in dinosaur again.It's also about these kids named Zach and Grey.The movie took place on a island of isla Nublar.SET 22 years after the event of Jurassic park. The main characters are Nick Robinson (zach),Ty Simpson (Grey), (chris Pratt) Owen, Bryce Dallas Howard (claire) and Iran khan (masrani). In my opinion I think that that Owen did he's part of the movie good. I didn't like Ms.Lauren lapkus part because she didn't really do anything.What i like about the movie is that they use dinosaur DNA make new dinosaur species.The movie great because there was a lot of action and there was even some Roman in the movie too.The one thing I didn't like is when something gets out.I think that younger people will like this movie because there are dinosaur and most kids like that and they might even like the action but this movie is for everyone.I will give this movie 9 out of 10.In my open i think that this movie is good."

Like maybe you have a favorite dinosaur. Also if you have seen the movie jurassic world then that's pretty much that well it's not the same thing like a copy but the movie is very similar.This movie took place in a island far away from other places so it can be safe.The main characters are Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard)the aunt , Owen (Chris Pratt)the raptor trainer,Zach (Nick Robinson) the oldest kid also Claires nephew in the movie, Gray (Tye Simpkin)the youngest kid also Clairs nephew, and Dr. Henry Wu (B.D.

The characters are 'Chris Pratt Bryce Dallas Howeard TysimpkinsGray NickRobinson VIncentP'onofrio and Irrfaninnam' this movie is about Dinosaurs and how Dinosaurs worked back then. For my own opinion ChrisPratt Bryce Dallas Howeard Tysimpkins Gray and Nick Robinson did the best and the ones I really didn't like was Irrfaninnam and Hoskins. What I really liked about this movie was that not only did we get to see action but we got to learn how where all the animals different compare to the animals we have now in days and not only that but we also learned how fast and dangerous those animals are like . What I really didn't like about this movie was that some characters didn't listen but they also learned that they were supposed to listen . For my own opinion the people that would like this movie would have to be people that like stuff back then and also like DNA stuff or just Dinosaurs. For the other people that does not like Dinosaurs or science they will still love this movie because I really don't like all the DNA stuff or science movies but I really loved this movie a lot THIS MOVIE WAS AMAZING and had a lot of action MY RATE on this movie would have to me a 10/10

",2017-09-19 00:00:00,6,"I have seen the movie Jurassic world and i'd like to give an opinion about it,the movie was kinda about how two little kids mach,and gray go visit there aunt Claire in Jurassic world and a big disaster happen and the got tricked by the Antoninus dinosaur. and the dinosaur escaped and they found out that it can camouflage so it ate two people and every time it will kill it will move forward to the island.It had took place in Jurassic world and it happened when Claire and Owen got done talking they went to see the Antoninus Rex and they thought it wasn't in the cage and it was so Claire called her friend the one that was left in the office and she told him to search for the dinosaur so they can catch it and put it back in the cage and he told her that it was in the cage and that's when they found out that it can camouflage and then when they tried to close the gate it broke out and started killing people and Owen found out that the Antoninus Rex was part raptor.What i like about the movie was that we got to see all the different types of dinosaurs and i didn't like Hopkins because he was annoying and bosses people around so much so i was kinda happy he died because i was getting irritated by him and i liked Owen and Claire because they were a good team and help save the world and what i learned was never know what you make and don't get tricked by a dinosaur i think other will learn never make a dinosaur that you can't control.I think a group of people that will like this movie is people who like to explore or like dinosaurs and others that like movies like Jurassic world and they would recommend it to Jurassic park and i wouldn't recommend it to Jurassic park because it's not the same well it is kinda the same but way different the rating is PG my final word is that the movie was good and i liked it.

" Jurassic World
",2017-09-19 00:00:00,8,"My personal opinion on Jurassic World I think that it is a good movie depending if you are into adventure or dinosaur movies if that makes since. I am not a fan of the dinosaur genre but it was good i think that the movie could've been shorter because people will not watch the whole thing if it is boring but with jurassic world it is not so i was able to watch. There was always a twist or turn and the movie had my eyes peeled. The characters are a big part of the story not only you wouldn't have movie without them but the way that the actors become the characters their own it is amazing. The Jurassic World luxury resort provides a habitat for an array of genetically engineered dinosaurs. Massive creature escapes,etc. Thought this movie it not just about the dinosaurs but it's about how the Owen,Claire,Zack,and Grey handled everything so there is an impact on the movie.There are the mechanical silicon type dinosaurs that they have located off the coast of Costa Rica and then the dinosaurs go lose and some die ad some go out of control. So Owen is like the dinosaur keeper or some sort and he takes care of the animals and make sure that they are in the clear. Claire invited her nephews that she doesn't really know because she feels bad. Being curious kids Zack and Grey go on this weird looking into the future rolly car and go on an adventure and other things happen from there. My personal favorite character was Claire because at first she was like ew and then she came out of her shell. I liked the movie but i did have a moment where it was gonna everywhere and i didn't know what was going on but eventually it smoothed itself out. I liked how they made the movie fictional and also funny. I didn't like how they made the movie out to be too much and didn't make it more adventurous they focused solely on the dinosaurs there is nothing wrong with that but they could have done better and expanded the base of the movie.People that would like this movie more are like scientist and nerds who like dinosaurs. I would recommend this movie to people who don't like action/adventure movies because this is a good movie to recommend so that they can go out of their comfort zone. I honestly give this movie 4 of 5 stars cause i liked i don't get me wrong but i do believe it could be better. This was my personal view on Jurassic World."
" All in all this movie was a great movie go check it out you will love it.
",2017-09-19 00:00:00,8,"I just saw the movie Jurassic World and I would like to give my opinion about it. This will make you jump, feel like you're there with them, excited, and maybe scream. When a dinosaur is chasing after them you will be screaming for them to run faster. So if you like action movies this movie is for you.It took place at Jurassic World where the old Jurassic Park Island was. The main characters are Aunt Claire, Owen, Zach, and Gray. Also the raptors, T-Rex, and the Indominus Rex were too. I think the actors/actresses did good for their part it seemed like they weren't in a movie and it was a real life situation. Also it seemed like they enjoyed acting for this movie and were actually interested in the movie. What i liked about this movie is that it was action packed and I was really interested in it and it got me thinking what if it was real. There was also science involved like how they created the dinosaurs, the technology, and more. I liked when the T Rex, raptors, and the mosasaur teamed up to take down the indominus rex that was probably my favorite scene. I learned that you should not make a dinosaur that you know is going to destroy everything and be way stronger than the other dinosaurs and will kill them all. The moral of the story is do not make a monster. I think others will learn that they should not have dangerous dinosaurs when there is people in danger. The group of people that would like this movie is people who like sci fi and action movies. I would recommend it to people who like action and sci fi movies and ages from six and above that age. The MPAA rating of this movie I would give it is a PG. My final word on the film is that it is great. I would give this movie a 5 out of 5 ."

They rebuilt a huge technological theme park and they named it Jurassic World. The main characters were Owen played by Chris Pratt; Aunt Claire played by Dallas Howard; Gray played by Ty Simpkins, and Zach played by Nick Robinson. It was a luxury theme park that provided a habitat of array of genetically engineered dinosaurs. Until the intelligent Indominus Rex escapes and sets off a chain reaction that causes other dinosaurs to go amok.What I liked was the story line, and how the scientific genetic dinosaurs were put together. There was really nothing I learned about this movie but their was nothing I disliked about the movie. I feel scientist should not try to bring back animals from the prehistoric time set.I think people who like action movies would enjoy and watch this movie. I would recommend it to my family and friends. The MPAA rating on this movie is PG13. My final score on the movie, that it was a good movie and I would give it four in a half stars out of five. In total Jurassic World is a very good movie."
" Jurassic world is about hybrids of dinosaurs that end up getting loose and getting tracked down by the military and their trainers
",2017-09-19 00:00:00,8,"Jurassic World ReviewThis movie is called Jurassic world and i will be doing a movie review on it. First is movie takes place on an island known as Jurassic world. On this island they create hybrids of dinosaurs and use them for entertainment purposes. This movie is about hybrid dinosaurs that escape out of containment and the trainers and military try to track it down. Second, this movie was good all around but, it could be a little more realistic. Claire was running in heels almost 100 percent of the movie. Even though she was running in heels i think the moral of this story is to never give up and think smart because they would not have been in that situation if they were not fooled by the claw marks on the wall.Finally, i think a lot of people would like this movie depending on what movies they like. Most of the movie was good except some scenes were not as realistic as the others. I don't mean the scenes about dinosaurs i'm talking about when Grace would sprint in high heels on rough terrain like forests or rocks by a waterfall. This is more of an action type of movie. It is rated PG 13. I would probably rate this movie 8 out of 10 if you asked me.In conclusion, a lot of people would like this movie. But it does depend on what type of movie they like. If they like action like movies then they would like this movie. But if they like comedy or anything like that they would not enjoy it as much. This movie is like an action type of movie."
" Jurassic World ""Rant-View:"" Or How ""Blue the Velociraptor"" is the love interest Christ Pratt deserves
",2017-09-16 00:00:00,3,"When talking to friends and family about this film I always referred to it as Jurassic Park, because it always looked like a facsimile of the 1993 film. It seemed like they took every touch point from the 1993 film & copied it over to Jurassic World. One of the first shots in JW is that of a complete flyover of the park from the famous Jurassic Park gates, accompanied by the legendary John Williams' theme swelling in the background. In the 1993 film, this was a stirring moment, we were entering the park for the first time, we had no clue as to what was behind those gates, or the chaos those gates were holding back. The gates symbolizing the latch on Pandora's Box. In JW, we get the EXACT SHOT with identical musical cues. Yet the scene has no more than 1/10 of the impact it did in 1993. We know what's going to happen in JW, the awe is gone.The only facet of JW that improves on JP is the special effects. The visual effects and sets are impressive. The dinosaurs & the actual Jurassic World park look spectacular! At this point, you're probably wondering ""What else matters?!"" Well a lot actually. Especially when all of your human characters are less fleshed out than the dinosaurs. One of the many elements that made JP such a classic was its human characters. Each character was developed & felt like a three dimensional person. Even side characters, Samuel Jackson's technician & Wayne Knight's two-bit villain all have character motivations that make their character choices understandable.In JW not one human character is developed in any meaningful way. Our main hero, Pratt's Owen, is a former Navy Seal & a now dinosaur trainer (these scenes would be ""side-splitting"" hilarious if it weren't for the dialogue), period. That's it. We know nothing else about him. Other than him & our heroine, Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), went on an ill-fated first date. When all hell breaks loose in Jurassic World, Claire goes to Owen to save her nephews solely because he's been designated ""hero man"" by the film's script.Let's now segue into JW's child characters, Zach & Gray. Zach & Gray are Claire's nephews. Zach is generic teenager #3 & Grey is generic kid who loves dinosaurs. These two serve no purpose other than being a reason for Owen and Claire to venture into Jurassic World. Every scene these two characters share makes absolutely no sense. They're there to be our virgin eyes into Jurassic World, showing us the park for the first time. Except we've been here before. Jurassic Park already explored the splendors of the dinosaur theme park. It's the equivalent of a friend telling you about the first season of your favorite TV show, which you've watched all 10 seasons of and know the dialogue inside & out. You're essentially being forced to consume something you've already digested.To say the script is garbage would be generous. The most worthy belongs to Vincent D'Onofrio's Vic wanting to use the Velociraptors as modern infantry. Claiming Velociraptors can't be bartered, hacked, or deterred in their pursuit of their prey. Hence, they are the perfect soldier. Pratt's Owen argues with Vic numerous times over this until the story calls for the (in)famous ""Pratt riding a motorcycle with a pack of Velociraptors"" shot, then Pratt's character does a complete 180° on the issue, which ultimately fails. I'd go into more detail, but that's spoiler territory.The best characters of JW are the dinosaurs. Not only because you have empathy for them, but because they are the only characters that are fun. Pratt's four Velociraptors are fun because they each have a name & distinct character traits. ""Blue,"" the leader, & the others follow her lead. Blue plays a critical role in the whole film, especially the climax. Pratt & Blue have more chemistry than any other two character in the film. It can be argued Blue is Pratt's true love interest, in lieu of Claire.But what are our heroes, unless they have a worthy foe? The ""big bad"" of JW is Indominus Rex, the first intentionally homicidal animal in a modern blockbuster. You could look at Indominus as the dinosaur version of Jason Voorhees. Indominus kills anything in its path simply because it's ""bad."" Another baffling decision made by the script. Indominus is eventually taken down by Pratt & his gang of misfits. The climax (one of the few bright spots of the film) is so over-the-top, it will be nearly impossible for the inevitable sequel to top.To call this film flawed is kind. I love cheesy movies. I love bad movies. There's a charm to something that goes so hilariously ""off-the-rails."" Yet Jurassic World is not an example of this. Halfway through Jurassic World's 124 minute runtime, I was pretty sure I lost my mind. At numerous points, I could not believe what I was watching was actually greenlit by a multi-billion dollar corporation. Never mind the record breaking box office and audience acclaim it's garnering. If you're still reading this (bless you!) I implore you not to see this movie. I don't even mean at the movie theater, but in general. Go watch Jurassic Park if you're inclined to see Jurassic World. Seen Jurassic Park already? Watch it again! There's nothing Jurassic World can give you that an umpteenth viewing of Jurassic Park can't."
" Enjoy it for what it is
",2017-09-07 00:00:00,8,"Most of the negative views I've seen yell about one of two things: nothing new to the movie (rehash of the originals, with minuscule changes), or that it was too unrealistic.To both of these criticisms I say... Duh. It's a movie about humans recreating (or rebreeding? Rehatching?) dinosaurs in a laboratory. There's sort of minimal differences to make, and expecting realism in a movie about breeding dinosaurs is asking a little much, in my opinion.It's a decent movie. It's got its funny moments, its eye candy for everybody, the plot isn't awful, the dinosaurs look pretty cool, and we even get to see Mr. Rex from the first movie pop up again.It wasn't meant to be some great big thriller; it wasn't meant to keep you wondering what was going to happen. It was supposed to be a movie you could veg to, relax, and just enjoy. Which in today's era of preachiness, was pretty nice."
" worst one of all
",2017-08-27 00:00:00,1,"You can't replace acting with high technology special effects. Selection of actors for this movie was horrible, worst acting ever. I watched a lot of stupid movies all the way through but this one I couldn't. American humor is just ridiculous, They screw it up BIG with this movie"
" Dull, dire, disappointing
",2017-08-18 00:00:00,4,"This film, mainly because of Chris Pratt, makes just enough of its one- dimensional plot to be watchable, but it is a dreadful mess. The plot formula is long worn out, to the extent that any form of believability is absent. That's not to say that a film about a dinosaur theme park ought to be realistic, but the characters are so moronic, and the key story elements so ludicrous and formulaic, that there is not enough left to tie it to the real world in which it sets its fantasy, and therefore there is no reason to care. This is not helped by wooden stock characters and the utterly predictable relationships between them. This film is a monotone, generic smashy-crashy blockbuster, devoid of charm, nuance, or emotional depth. And to add insult to injury, despite over 20 years of improved technology, the CGI dinosaurs are rendered less realistically than their counterparts from the original Jurassic Park! What a disappointment."
" It was OK; nothing special by any means
",2017-08-07 00:00:00,4,"My two biggest problems about it are: 1) the older brother being girl- obsessed in a really weird way (He's absurdly depressed about leaving his girlfriend for a little while at the beginning, then, all he does early on at the park is stare at other girls he likes and then smile when they eventually giggle at him staring at them. His little brother appropriately lets him know it's not going to do anything by him just staring, which makes them laugh and walk away. He gives his brother a sarcastic thanks and I thought, ""Well what do you expect? You weren't going to have anything going for yourself and it was for your own good. Either talk to them or don't; don't just keep staring at them like a total weirdo."" 2) It's obvious, at the climax, the huge main dinosaur they're after is some kind of raptor from her communicating with the raptors; you don't need to have Mr. Pimp Daddy be the one to figure it out while everyone else is clueless: ""I know why they wouldn't tell us what it really is."" (Gosh, ya think?) ""Why?"" ""That thing is part-raptor."" (You're a quick one.)"
" Rubbish, rubbish, rubbish
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,3,"How low is the bar these days? How does something so derivative and uninspiring still manage to garner 7 stars on a large review database?Acting wasn't the problem, which is a nice change in terrible movies, but this story... Wow. THAT is a story? It's basically the original Jurassic Park, but far, far worse, but following the exact same series of events.Dinosaurs? Check. Two children (one of whom is obsessed by dinosaurs)? Check. Bad guys looking to exploit dinosaur research? Check. Obvious plot as to how dinosaurs are more intelligent than expected? Check. OTT action that is beyond the scope of physical possibility? Check. Actors always being in the wrong place at the wrong time, but able to ""somehow"" get through it? Check.This was terrible. Shyte in fact. This says far too much about the state of the audience than I'd care to speculate on if they're enjoying this. The fact that a new one has been green-lit says a lot too.I clearly have nothing in common with the low-expectation audience that passes as a movie critic (not that these exist any more) these days."

" Jurassic Photoshop (paytv)
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,4,"You know the feeling of the actual magazines in which all the pictures are enhanced digitally: sure they have no defects but they look terribly fake and at the end, the result is opposite to the one wanted: they inspire no emotion! Here it's the same thing with this movie: Released 22 years after the original Spielberg, you can compare both easily and it gives you an accurate state of filmmaking. So sure the dinosaurs seem real and scary but look at the world they live in: it's either blue (night, inside rooms) or yellow (outside, props, building). So if you have to trade technicolor to have better SFX, I say no! Give me back my colors and my inferior dinosaurs of 1993 because here, after maybe one hour, I was already fed up by this fake world! Now, if I look at the story, it's the same mixed feelings: this is a great thing to discover how the park can actually work, with people and attractions I liked also the wink to the original movie; But, except those few moments, the movie just keep recycling: that is to say doing what has been already done: everything is under tight control except the moment when ; Kids tied to park management in danger; the greedy experts that fails miserably  In addition, there is a lot of pretty stupid stuff: the vanishing dinosaur ? the divorce case ??At the end, the movie is entertaining maybe one hour before becoming totally predictable and fake. As the Star Wars, Alien franchises, I won't look at any quick sequels and just wait another 22 years to take the pulse.. NB: as a french, I feel compelled to add a few words about our most beloved people, the laughable Omar Sy (sadly, his 1st rank is not a joke)! What an American career (translated by our french medias as worldwide notoriety)! After a cameo in X-men, now he just pet raptors and he is as mediocre as ever!"

" How is this rated 7?!
",2017-07-06 00:00:00,4,"So having grown up with the original, I was very low expectations from this, and well, they were met.Where do we start? The predictable story line, the two dimensional characters, the idiotic sub plot just to have kids in there like in the original.The only redeeming part of this shitty remake, is the effects, but guess what, if the movie sucks, then the effects are going to be overlooked.If you're 12, you'll probably like it... but all the people that grew up with the original, are over 25 today, so how was the target audience for this?"
" Great Start to a New Trilogy
",2017-07-02 00:00:00,9,"After viewing this film two years ago, I remember hoping that they'd continue with the story. Not much later, Jurassic World 2 was announced, and just recently received THE FALLEN KINGDOM subtitle.Jurassic World was a great continuation of the Jurassic franchise, as well as the start of a new planned trilogy. The only link in this film, besides the title and the park, is Dr. Henry Wu (B.D. Wong). Owen Grady, played by Chris Pratt, is very awesome, and a fan theory is that he is the boy from the original Jurassic Park that is teased by Dr. Alan Grant. Nothing confirmed, but a fun idea. Also, Bryce Dallas Howard (daughter of Ron Howard) stars as Grace, the park supervisor.Some of the best scenes remind us of the original, and why it was such a hit in 1993. And this was a huge hit in 2015. Will that streak continue? Time will tell."
" Jurassic World review
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,8,"Jurassic World is a film directed by Colin Trevorrow. Initially, I had no interest in seeing this film. I thought basically its just dinosaurs running here and there. But I watched the first film again. I became a fan of it. I skipped the next 2 (basically because of its reviews). I watched this. And I was overjoyed.Plot: When an Indominous Rex gets out of hand in the newly built Jurassic World, its upto the authorities to get a control on the species.Story and direction: Now I went into this film knowing that it couldn't be in level with the first part. That was ultimate. But I was expecting a decent film. And yes, I got that. The VFX and camera work both are good. The dinosaurs looked a little 'faked' at times although the character designs for the dinosaurs were great. Hey, but that's just me. The film actually takes a little time to start, about 20 minutes. But after that, it was bang on. I liked the entry to Owen's character. He showed that there is a great promise to this franchise. The story was basically here and there. There were subplots that were kind of distracting me. The kids were kind of unnecessary. It felt as if they were recreating the first that also had two kids!!!! And using raptors as military weapons!!! That was atrocious. Here that was not even necessary. The climatic battle between the dinosaurs was a visual treat to the eyes.Performances: Chris Pratt proved that he can do roles other than the Star Lord. Bryce Dallas was also great. Vincent D'Onofrio was good as the semi-villain (although the part was not needed). The kids were also fantastic in their roles. Irrfan Khan again proved that why I loved him. B D Wong was OK.Favorite Scene: I guess it would be the scene after Chris Pratt's entry. The communication and bond that was shown between the dinos and humans was phenomenal. I hoped that this theme would have been further explored in the film.Verdict: Jurassic World is actually a good film. It has some flaws but it is watchable. Definitely not better than the original. Can't actually wait for Fallen Kingdom to come.I am giving it an 8/10."
" Really fun and exciting!
",2017-06-23 00:00:00,8,"This movie is really fun, thrilling and exciting. Chris Pratt is superb, he rocks this movie. He is one of the animal rangers and is training the raptors to accept him as their alpha. The raptors as so cool, I love them. From the onset you know the park is doomed, there is an air of not 'if' but 'when'. The whole cast in the film are fab, they all shine and deliver tip top performances.There are some great additions to the Jurassic family including a genetically created very angry and very big dinosaur, a giant sea monster and a hamster ball attraction.For any fans of the franchise this doesn't disappoint, the special effects are breathtaking. The negativity surrounding this film is not surprising but if you are expecting reality why watch a Jurassic Park movie?!"
" Terrible with a Power Rangers ending.
",2017-06-09 00:00:00,1,"This is the worst movie of 2015 by far. I have watched over 1k of movies all added on IMDb and this is the first review i have written. Such a fan of the original franchise all 3 movies were good, this film is blockbuster rubbish at its finest.All made for money, rubbish acting, rubbish story line. The end is shocking it anger me beyond believe.STORY LINE - Freak DNA monster created (Like that story line has not been done before)Escapes, kills everything, and dies.And wait..... the ending is amazing.Bring back the power ranger teaming up & tag team with the other dinosaurs to kill the beast.Woooooooooooowwww..... Do not watch this pile of rubbish if i could swear on this site i would."
" This is no 7 star movie!
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,1,"**** This Review May Contain Spoilers*** I ordered this movie because IMDb showed a 7 star rating. I don't understand how this movie could have deserved a 7. A new dinosaur has been created that is so smart it removes a tracking device from it's own body so that it can't be tracked. It tricks the handlers into thinking it left its cage by lowering it's heat signature. I fast forwarded the last 1/3 of the movie because curiosity got the better of me. I had to see how the script writers were going to dig themselves out of this one. Flying dinosaurs are loosed but the story ends without resolving this little fact. Driving a motorcycle among Raptors, which apparently have been programmed to work with the protagonists. Bad script and bad acting. Don't waste your time."
" Fun, but are all the characters THAT stupid?
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,6,"Okay, I will TRY to not judge this film too much on it's obviously superior predecessor Jurassic Park... BUT, there will be some areas where that will be inevitable, but that is to be expected. No, I don't think this is a bad film, it's much better than the vast majority of the underwhelming CGI overkill films that are released nowadays. I would say its fun, but its not a masterpiece.Chris Pratt is fun, I don't know why but he is, and his character helps redeem this movies flaws. The idea of the park is too and so are some of the dinosaurs, but I don't see the attraction in the whole genetic manufacturing of new species, including the big bad one with that name I can't recall. What's wrong with the old dinosaurs? Honestly, they are dinosaurs, they will always be interesting so there is no need to create a pterodactyl with a T-Rex head and a Raptor's arse or whatever, there's just no need.Some of the visuals are fantastic, but they don't take away from the plot's gaping hole which for me played on my mind throughout the whole film. In the original, the workers at JP are sold out by Wayne Knight's character, yes the park had bugs but it fell apart based on betrayal. Whereas in JW, they are literally competent enough to build the theme park but alarmingly too stupid to maintain it. They have built the big bad dinosaur to have camouflage, and then get surprised when they couldn't see it in the cage? They fit with a GPS, and then don't check it BEFORE entering the cage, so they completely overreact and the creature has now outwitted them without even trying. They fitted it with camouflage and GPS and then lose their minds wondering where it is! Also, it may have been worth fitting the cage with a human sized door... pretty standard in any minor zoo, much less a prehistoric theme park. Thats where the disaster starts, but unlike the workers of JP, it is ALL their fault. Honestly, you'd think people in charge of such a big park would have a bit more common sense. There were other minor plot holes but this one got me the most.This doesn't completely destroy the film, it has it's strengths and is by no means un-watchable like other remakes. I liked Pratt's story with the raptors, although it probably could have done without using them like power rangers later in the film though... And I did appreciate the T-Rex (the original leviathan) saving the day in an albeit predictable manor. Yes, this film isn't without strengths.It is possible to love JP and still enjoy JW, I promise."
" Something that i was missing.
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,10,"Alright this film was amazing. This film gave me the thrill of an adventure film. When i was about 6-7 years old, when i saw the first movie. For me this film was a gift and I watched it as a child again and after all, I was shaking with excitement. I admit there were some points in the film that doesn't make any sense,but in one word: If you liked Jurassic Park, I think you will definitely enjoy this one as well."
" The worst
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,1,"This movie is notable for being by far the worst of the series. The miscasting of the central characters is hilarious, and the screenplay is pretty much a lesson in how not to write a script. Bryce Dallas Howard is utterly wasted as Claire Dearing, a wickedly self indulgent and criminally irresponsible character who aroused such a sense of revulsion in me that I spent the rest of the movie hoping something scaly would chew her head off. It was not to be - but more than that, she triumphs, the lesson being that psychopathic bad behavior carries no consequences. There is also a farcical attempt to make her the love interest, again utterly at odds with her character. And as the for the rest, occasionally some good action sequences, too many people who looked like they just time warped out of the 70's, and generally a sour feeling at the end that I just wasted a couple of hours out of my life that will never be reclaimed. See it, but understand it for what it is - second rate garbage."
" Empty fun
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,6,"Jurassic World has the originality of the indominus rex: it is a rehash of the first movie, with a couple of things from the sequels and a crazy idea thrown in: let's train the velociraptors. It all ends up being entertaining enough, but it is empty as they come and it loses steam along the way, ending with a lazy lazy last part.Isla Nublar is opened to tourists, but after so many years the clients and investors are asking for more and more: bigger, badder, more threatening. It seems seeing velociraptors or playing with triceratops ain't fun anymore. A couple of kids (the typical couple of kids that seem to have to be our center of attention in these movies) go visit the park, where their aunt Claire (yes, we have all talked about it, those shoes) is working. Also working, as a raptor trainer, is manly man Owen, always sweating, always being very hairy and manly, always half-step away of saying his sentences growling.We all know what is going to happen, right? The new dinosaur, a dinosaur that has some tyrannosaurus rex in his DNA (and the rest, secret secret) is going to go on a trip around the island wreaking havoc and making bad, very bad things happen. The way it gets loose is lazy as they come and kind of laughable, but OK, we will accept it. The rest of the plot, I don't need to tell you. You already know it.However, the movie is fun. The acting, even if hilarious in all the machismo the male characters seem to be suffering of, is good enough. The pace is high enough, and even if the plot and its twists make less sense than Claire's shoes, keep things chugging along. And the CGI makes us (more or less) believe in what is going on.If it had had a tighter running time, and if it had left out some risible moments, though, it would have been better."

",2017-03-15 00:00:00,10,the opening of jurassic world jurassic park 4 has more then the last three of it's series. they have two t rex and the wholes park looks amazing and lots of teeth of dinosaurs. it has been 65 years since jurassic park began and Steven Sprilberg done a really good job as directing all 4 films in the series. i like the way dinosaurs walk and roar and the rides in this film is different to the other three films. the characters are amazing with their lines and movements. i also like the bonus features of jurassic world. i have enjoy watching how the making of jurassic world and how the sound and music makes the film back to the very first film
" Entertaining but maybe a little too incoherent in story
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,6,"Although extremely unrealistic and incoherent in the actual story line, this movie achieves its purpose to thrill and entertain the audience through high-quality visual and sound effects. No one actually expects any kind of emotive story or philosophical meaning in these kinds of movies. However, even without looking at the part about how well it delivered any kind of a message to the audience, there are flaws and inconsistency in the flow of the plot. There are also happening that really were not necessary, and some parts were just way to unrealistic that it made me lose focus and cringe at it. For example, there is no way a woman in skirts and heels can faster, or as fast as a T-Rex, even if it's a fake, man-made one. But still, the movie didn't get boring in any part unless the easily predictable story line does. For me, I didn't mind the usual old story, because I had watched it for the physical experience itself of watching the magical creatures and being scared by the way-too- loud roaring and screaming of both dinosaurs and humans."
" A fun popcorn thriller!
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,7,"Jurassic world is the 4th installment in the Jurassic Park franchise. It's main plot is a new open park full with man made dinosaurs and one day the company decides to make a genetic hybrid to boost the public's attention. But that of course goes horribly wrong and soon enough the hybrid is on the loose and killing people left and right. While all of this is going on, a raptor trainer Owen and the park's owner Clair must stop this monster before a monster mash goes down. First the good. Chris Pratt plays a good role and he is easily the best human character. The action is very entertaining and very pleasing to the eye. The dinosaurs are very cool as always, and the hybrid was awesome. The suspense is one of the strongest things this movie has to offer. But now time for the bad. There are a few people you do not really care about, for example there are two kids in the movie that were completely hollow and didn't have any real purpose except for escaping the dinosaurs. And sometimes this movie can come off as silly when it tries to be cool. So in the end Jurassic World is a fun, action packed, summer blockbuster that may not be as good as the original but has it memorable moments in the Jurassic Park universe. 7/10 Check it out."

" Jurassic World
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,4,Well choreographed action set-pieces. Good effects. Dinosaurs are magnificent.Annoyingly clichéd characters. Stupid story. I thought the idea of commercialism and ethics could have and should have been explored better. A character talks about never being able to match the first part which is true. Not sure if they were trying to be funny or just self-referentially depressing.Chris Pratt was good. Everyone else was pointless.No where near the first. I would even prefer to watch Jurassic Park 3 than this.

It's been a long time since I've seen a movie where that happened."

Have you sold out!!!It does not compare to the first one, save for much of the plot elements were copied and pasted. These Jurrasic movies seem to have some fixation on two children whose parents are getting a divorce, so they send the kids to a relative who is running a dinosaur theme park where bad things happen!!! Thats how they did it in the first movie and that is how they did it in this one just with different characters. You do not need to reimagine a film for a new generation because film is a recorded media and you can just watch the older one as many times as you want. And if you are going to reimagine a film to match the current generation -- why would you put holograms in it-- last I checked the 3d hologram was still being developed shouldn't you have just smart phones and -- well I guess it is a theme park run by a gazillionaire. Was the movie supposed to be set in the not too distant future?Chris Pratt is the only good character in my opinion in the film -- his raptor training, however, has to be the most laughable things I have ever seen -- those things should only eat your face off! The gratuitous practical effect dinosaur was nothing more than the studio throwing a crumb to the people who are demanding better special effects than this particular CGI that makes the ""Land Before Time"" characters look more realistic.Sort of Spoiler: The Indominus Rex hunted for sport -- (its got human DNA in it they don't say it in the movie but that is what I think!)But what has to be the most asinine thing in this movie -- is the ending -- the actual F*#K was Trevorrow thinking!!! I laughed on purpose in mockery when that velociraptor had a ""I'm saving the day scene"" in which it teamed up on the bad guy with the T-rex and then after killing it they regarded each other and then the T-Rex turned away and pulled a Pride Rock scene ripped straight out of the ""Lion King""!!! Remember in the original film how these animals were cold blooded killers!! How the same T-Rex would just as much bite your face off as look at you!!! The raptors in this film were completely neutered --(Well I suppose the exception being when they were actually killing people but they weren't as malevolent a presence as in the first film -- and much bluer for some reason). Were they watching one of those lost cat and dog ""Homeward Bound"" coming home movies while filming this?The Indominus Rex was the dinosaur version of a Mary Sue pulling all sorts of tricks out of its a$$ just for the plot of the movie to work. Dumb Dumb Dumb movie -- watch it as a comedy. Also overly sleek in visual style very glossy -- not rough enough -- too much blue not enough red. The animation action scenes were very showy and that removes you from the film. We are not watching a Loony Toons short, though I imagine you studio people would ruin that too. Bread and Circus.Peace to anyone reading this in 2017."
" Definitive Proof That This Is A One-Story Franchise
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,3,"""Jurassic World"" was guaranteed to turn a large profit no matter if it was ""good"" or ""bad"". The franchise is quite popular and it just has that ""summer blockbuster"" feel to it. Sadly, I wish that the film's creators would have attempted to make the plot of the film even decent, or create characters that aren't wooden caricatures.For a basic plot summary, ""Jurassic World"" sees the vision of Mr. Hammond finally complete...a fully-functional dinosaur amusement park. Of course, in today's ""bigger and better"" society, it isn't good enough just to reproduce classic dinosaurs. Now, new dinos (one bigger than T-Rex and another that can swallow a shark in a single gulp, among others) are being genetically spliced and created in a lab. The park is run by Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), a profit-driven corporate executive type who doesn't even have time for her two nephews (played by Nick Robinson & Ty Simpkins) when they visit the park. Dinosaur caretaker Owen (Chris Pratt), on the other hand, is fully aware of what these dangerous animals can do if not reckoned with. A military sub-plot simmers in the background of the story. The new ""big boy"" dinosaur gets loose, and from there it is what one would expect from this type of film.This movie features an ethical debate about genetic manipulation, two annoying kids who are the definition of stupidity, a lot of rampaging dinosaurs, and and vision to build the most ill-advised theme park in human history. If this sounds at all familiar to you, it is probably because you've seen the original ""Jurassic Park"". I honestly don't know if I've ever seen a sequel (which does not market itself as a remake) that is so unabashedly similar to its predecessor(s).I think the problem with this franchise is simple: It had one great story to tell, and Steven Spielberg did just that in ""Jurassic Park"". All the sequels have failed to capture nearly a glimmer of that magic, because the novelty has worn off and there aren't good stories to tell. At least ""Lost World"" & ""III"" try to bring something original to the screen. ""World"" doesn't even go that far, instead settling for a few new dinosaurs and riding on the name of the franchise. The plots are incredible dumb/predictable and the characters are more of the same.The only reason I won't give this movie a ""bottom of the barrel"" 1-star review is because there are a few exciting scenes (the opening 20-30 minutes shows promise before quickly descending into predictability and repetition) and it is a ""slick"" experience from beginning to end. Even though you know that what you are watching isn't great, there is so much going on and so much action that you can never just mentally ""check out"". In that sense, this really is the textbook ""brainless summer blockbuster"".Even though I came into this viewing experience with mediocre expectations, I was disappointed that ""Jurassic World"" didn't even live up to that standard. If you've been hiding under a rock since 1993 and haven't seen any of the other ""Jurassic"" films, you will love this one! For those who like a little bit of plot and a few interesting characters with their whiz-bang dinosaur action, however, it will be clear to you that this franchise can no longer deliver either of those two things."
" A low-intelligent movie with absolutely no sense
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,3,"Bad actings, bad scripts, no real-life sense, this movie just tells the audience what the word fictional means, that is, totally fake with absolutely no intelligence in it.I have never watched old Jurassic Park movies, this is the first time I watch a movie labeled Jurassic Park, and from the time on that I finished watching the movie, the name will only make me think of the word stupidity whenever I will see the name again.The plot is simply horrible. The character I have the biggest problem with is Claire(Bryce Dallas Howard). Seriously literally I have never seen any fictional character in any movie or book that is just so narcissistic, selfish, immature, stupid as a protagonist who was supposed to be on the good side, she was just so... b-itchy.So in the movie, with a genetically modified Dinosaur-lizard hybrid monster killing machine that was created by Claire as a background preset , she wouldn't listen to advice to evacuate Jurassic Park tourists when they had a chance, shouting to people telling her to call off a mission that would kill all the men involved in, being in a jungle searching for kids by shouting out loud their names and when being hushed she would shout back ""Hey you are not my boss!!"", and then after being a b-itch all along, suddenly shot a dinosaur saved the male protagonist(Chris Pratt) and the male stood up and said, ""Hey, the kids and dinosaurs and those running mates are watching, let's give it a kiss"". ""Oh how romantic"", the genius director thought himself when he was filming this scene while eating popcorn rubbing his toes gap then gave hischick a kiss. And Zach(Nick Robinson) and his little brother, were alone in a glass ball vehicle, while the broadcast was warning all tourists to head back and all entries would be closed soon, Zach said suck it I ain't head back let's head on for more fun, then accelerated, his brother was worried and begged him to go back, he said, ""Yo bro don't be shy, this is all for yr happiness, see there's a sign read 'restricted area', come on lemme drive yo in"", and then murmured, ""otherwise how ma supposed to let those adults to save myass, I can't think of a better way to let this super awesome CGI movie go on"". Both of these characters had no apologies to whom they should apologize to at all,And then here comes the bad guy who wants to make raptors be militarized weapons so he can get some money because he was sure military will have to buy them so they can save more soldiers life on battlegrounds, our good guys were so pissedoff, especially Claire -- ""You lair! I only made the monster and I only was responsible for all the dead out there and I am a bad aunt, and how dare you lied to us all and try to make money out of dinosaurs, F U"", And while our four good guys and the bad guy were arguing in a circle in a lab, suddenly a raptor rushed in and the bad guy was like ""oh, gosh, run, the good guys run to that corner I should go to the opposite"" , and then got eaten alive, bad guys always die huh. And then our heroes were running away from raptors, ""oh so close, but you can't catch me because I'm the good guy, lalalalalala~""And finally we meet our hybrid monster again, as they were near the edge of being torn by its claws, the kid thought of a genius plan, how about us releasing other dinosaurs and let them kill that moster?Claire then padded on his little niece's head, ""Good boy"", then ran to open the gate released a T-rex(hehe, genius indeed) then led it to the monster and the T-rex like a meow-meow cat following his master closely but wouldn't even scratch her cloth, and together with his friend raptor and his sea buddy mosasaur, he killed the outcast hybrid who was killed for being too intelligent because he could camouflage and kill people. After eliminating the bad guy, our hero dinosaurs looked at each other's eyes giving eye contact and brotherhood love, then walked in different ways peacefully, they just killed an animal for being too intelligent because it could camouflage, and time to take a break.At the end our T-rex hero after being released killing a hybrid monster for being too intelligent and violent, without hurting anybody any animal along the road, walked to the edge of the cliff, in the early morning sunshine, and roaring his glory out to draw the movie's end, what a splendid scene! ""It's Jurassic Park dinosaurs, suuuuckers!"" Roared the T-rex, right in front of the audience sitting behind that big fat screen."
" No Surprises
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,6,"Look, I enjoyed this film, OK. Dramawise everything was in place and the two kids were so unlikable, that you actually enjoyed when they were getting the scare of their lives. Of course, the plot is a tad too predictable in that it just recycles the story line of old Jurrasic flicks, i.e., greed trumps common sense and safety last. There is just one thing that doesn't make sense at all. If the marketing team of Jurassic World is in desperate need for a new Park sensation, why oh why design a Dinosaur that looks and behaves pretty much like the T Rex. I get it, they need that for the final Boss Fight, but there it becomes so blatantly obvious that the new monster is exactly like the old monster, so much as I had trouble to figure out which one was which."
" We will always have Jurassic Park.
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,2,"Jurassic Park was not only a decade defining film, it was a technical wonder, wisely balancing fun, spectacle, adventure, horror and comedy in a sharp and sensible way. The sequels that followed paled in comparison to the original, but still retained a sense of fun and understanding. Cut to 2015. Thank you Colin Trevorrow. Thank you for uninspiringly and atrociously murdering an already quality declining franchise that land-marked my childhood. Jurassic World went through development hell, a roulette of screenwriters and directors that at one point or another were deemed unfit or felt the story needed betterment. It's all the more revolting that the final product we were given is such a lazy, blunt and appalling rehash or update of the original entry. Every plot point is uninspired, every single idea is pedestrianly realised and every look overly stylized and saturated. As a devout film fan myself, whose list of guilty pleasure or so-bad- that's-so-good films is almost embarrassing to admit, I found(ind) that Jurassic World cannot in anyway qualify to any of such categories. This is a franchise that I followed as I grew up, spawned by one of the most marvelous films ever made; this fourth entry though managed to shamelessly spit on its legacy, reduce it to laziness and banality, to a level of insulting dullness. Once more, let us thank and grant Trevorrow such honour."
" Not as magical, but a great addition to the franchise
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,7,"Jurrasic World is a perfect blend of new ideas and old ideas to the Jurrasic franchise. With some great moments made as an homage to the original, it has its light moments, its comedic moments, and its action, balanced well enough to carry an overused and predictable plot. Howard does a beautiful job as the powerful lead actress trying to control chaos and the consequent adaption required. And D'onofrio, as talented of an actor as he is, was a complete miss in character. His comically painted villainy is cheesy, cliché, and crosses the border into hilarity. It becomes so bad, it feels ironic and intentional. Jurrasic World is an enjoyable feat that does far better than its predecessors but unfortunately, it is not as magical as the original."
" Dino might!
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,7,"It's been quite some time since the initial disaster on Isla Nublar, and the late John Hammonds' dream of a fully functioning dinosaur theme park has finally come to fruition. Thousands flock to an island paradise where they see the mighty lizards put on display. Naturally, since this is meant to be a thrill ride, colossal human error will dictate that our ferocious antagonists get loose and wreak havoc on park visitors and personnel. Chief among them is a genetic freak called an ""Indominus Rex"", created because at this point people supposedly consider ordinary dinosaurs passe.One has to put up with some ridiculous, insipid characters and lame dialogue in this, the most recent entry in this ongoing franchise, but if all you want is to see big lizards run about and attack and eat people, you'll get it. Director Colin Trevorrow, with the assistance of such talents as production designer Ed Verreaux, cinematographer John Schwartzman, and editor Kevin Stitt, is able to create lots of brainless thrills. And make no mistake, it is pretty brainless. There are the standard absurdities to tolerate on the way to enjoying ""Jurassic World"". The main ones would be these human characters. This viewer certainly wouldn't have minded seeing most of them, if not all of them, become dinosaur chow. Surviving with his dignity intact is studly Chris Pratt, as a guy who's actually succeeded in training raptors. Forced to play a real archetype is Vincent D'Onofrio as a schemer who believes the ""Indominus Rex"" and the raptors would make excellent military weapons.The dinos, of course, are the *real* stars of this show. The visual effects are generally pretty good, and we see menaces that also include an enormous swimming mosasaur and numerous pterodactyls. Things get a little too precious, however, when we consider the bond that Pratt has developed with his raptor friends.The finale pulls out all the stops for any lover of dinosaur cinema, so things do end on a reasonably high note.Seven out of 10."
" Finally a sequel as good as Jurassic Park!
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,8,"Now, listen. Not even Spielberg knew what to do with the sequels for Jurassic Park! And this movie nailed it! The park looks just amazing! The dinosaurs are the biggest problem in my opinion. You can tell they are CGI, and the new dinosaur, the I-Rex looks bland and boring. What this movie did good is making it a direct sequel to Jurassic Park and ignoring The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III. The highlight of the film is easily the fight between the T-Rex and I-Rex, and the mosasaurus and raptors jumping in the fight.9/10. Jurassic World isn't perfect, the dinosaurs look bad, but the acting is great and concept is great. This movie is amazing and I cannot wait for the sequels to come out."
