" Wonderful movie
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,10,"Yes, there are horrible villages in India where people have same dangerous mentality! Yes, there are people who want to change such things. And yes, there are people who end up dying in such attempts. While most such attempts are futile, this movie certainly shows one that isn't. Loved it. India needs to change the way it treats its criminals."
" Absolutely amazing movie
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,10,I just watched the movie and it is amazing. A very well written script through amazing perfomances. The script is to the point and simple and it shows the reality of the villages in the country.
" A Must Watch
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,10,"One of the best crime based movies ever... Anushka Sharma has done a fantastic job.. Her best performance for sure.. This movie will leave you in silence in the end.. Very good storyline, acting, everything.. You won't feel bored a single second.. Just don't miss it.. :)"
" New age Indian cinema
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,10,One of the best film of 2015 and it's story is gripping and grounded with fresh story and Anushka Sharma really steals the show. Overall a excellent movie.
" Wow, so empowering!
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,10,"Bollywood needs more such women centric, not your regular masala movie types. Leaves you all happy and empowered!"
" Not good not bad.
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,6,"The movie is okay to watch for time pass. Some intervals are good, but very much streched. Ending was boring. middle part is only good."
" Anushka's First Ever Venture Into Production Didn't Fail To Impress
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,7,"When a meaningful actor turns into producer, there are some expectations raised and we expect good stuff, and that's what Anushka delivers here, just like Pari (though it was a latter production of hers), she is going into genres we are used to seeing in Hollywood only. A trip gone wrong type of movie ends up being in Bhoot Bungalow in most of Bollywood films, but this crime thriller is set in the backdrop of Haryana's honour killings and the script is straight forward and tight, doesn't go into unnecessary excess and though some critics wished for a more struggle-laden climax, it chooses not to be so and leaves aside any poetic component to it. I give it a 7.5/10, at times we are not in a mood to watch certain kinds of movies, and 1/4th into the movie I thought of some other options as I was maybe not in a mood to watch this particular type on a Saturday afternoon, but I stuck to it and I enjoyed it.N.B: The director initially chose for Rajkumar Rao for the husband's role but eventually went for the look-alike Neil Bhoopalam, who did an equally good job though."
" A really good movie.
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,9,"Amazing movie, good story-line. I think Director was soft on Anushka Sharma because of her being a producer. and also camera man could have been better some angles could have been better. overall amazing movie. I would love to watch any other movie where urban and rural area are compared side by side. and also the backward thinking of India about caste and religion."
" Please read my short review about this movie
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,10,"I was not considering in watching this movie in the beginning
Sometimes you thinks the good rating of the movie is just for the actress
But not for this movie, this movie is real thrilling like Hollywood Jurassic world obviously not dinosaurs just the thrilling part of it
The story looks so real and can happen to anyone
Movie is really watchable in silent environment and just ignore few of boring and then it's all thrill
You will love this movie"
" Decent Attempt At Western-Style Revenge Flick.
",2020-03-07 00:00:00,7,"One of the great pluses here is ""NH10"" didn't feel the need to wedge in a song & dance number like they do in 99% of Bollywood films. With it, I wouldn't have been able to sit all the way through. Generally, the acting isn't bad; kinda weak, though, in the male lead. I recommended this R film (profanity, violence) simply for the fact it told the story without a ridiculous forced song & dance number and it moved along swiftly."
" Ediot people
",2019-09-13 00:00:00,3,Cut your own foot with your own axe..... so never watch it.... story of ediot couple
" 9 stars for Anushka's amazing performance
",2019-09-04 00:00:00,9,Nice movie. Bit voilent but story was meant to be like this. Anushka did a good job. She proved her acting skills and told that she can handle the film single handedly. Also I am happy that this kind of women centric film was successful at box office. Anushka should do a women centric film like this again.
" Stupid story
",2019-04-19 00:00:00,1,What would you expect to happen if you become hero in highway area.
" Really damn good movie...
",2018-11-07 00:00:00,8,This movie is really not for those who like commercial masala movies.... The acting by everyone was above average but anushka sharma was excellent... I like the plot of the movie as well as the direction... A little slow but nail biting finish.....
" Another movie copied from Hollywood
",2018-10-31 00:00:00,5,From the start of the movie i realised what will come next.Well but the actors and directors have done well but of anyone will watch britsh movie Eden Lake...definitely they will not like this movie.Eden Lake is the best and the message in tht movie about the spoilt young generation is really thought provoking..I suggest everyone to watch Eden Lake rather than NH10..I am sure u will nt regret watching Eden Lake..
" boring start, average overall, great ending
",2017-05-30 00:00:00,8,"Acting was great in this movie. I think the build up with the 'nothing can go right in this movie' attitude seemed a little bit forced. even if it were slower or longer, I'd prefer some helpful characters, a couple of little things that go right once in a while (that don't go south immediately after the next minute). People like exaggeration and all good / all bad content, people like emotionally loaded revenge sequences too. This is a good movie, this is why I rated it with 8 stars, but the expectations were so built up, I felt like this was going to be a 16-star movie. so my honest rating is 8 stars, but if we're talking about ""how it could be"", it's practically 5 stars."
" Not your normal Thriller!
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,9,"I've just finished watching this movie.Yes although it was released a few years ago.It was an emotionally packed movie.It'll make you shout,cringe,cry,love.It makes me realize the current real situation of Indian cultural system which I had very little information of.It makes me realize how lucky I am to have access to most of things I wish to achieve.I am officially a fan of Anushka Sharma.Hats off to NH10"
