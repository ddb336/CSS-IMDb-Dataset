" Epitaph to Billy Connolly ?
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,4,"Read such good reviews but was so let down with this unfunny very improbable story. If this actually happened, Social Services would be swarming around the Highlands like ants and the adults taken into custody pronto. Billy was great, but he always is, unfortunately could not save this Muppet from disaster. I gave it 4 for him."
" Lovely family film that takes you on a roller-coaster of emotions.
",2020-12-23 00:00:00,7,"A British 2014 film, or to be specific, a Scottish film made by BBC (Alba) Films and Creative Scotland. Written and directed by Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkins, this film has a runtime of 95-minutes and was made with a reported budget of £3.5million, which it more than doubled at the box office (£10.7 million). The film stars David Tennant and Rosamund Pike as Doug and Abi McLeod. The London based couple have split up and live separately but still have interactions due to their 3 children who live with mother Abi. Doug's father Gordie (Billy Connolly) has terminal cancer but is due to celebrate his 75th birthday soon. His other son, Gavin (Ben Miller), is arranging a lavish party at their mansion in Scotland with his wife Margaret (Amelia Bullmore). When Doug and Abi arrive with their children it is clear that Gordie isn't really that interested in a party, it's more down to Gavin wanting to do it. So, wanting nothing to do with it, but instead wanting to spent time with his grandchildren, Gordie takes them to the beach while the grown-up's prepare the party and squabble with each other. The kid's love their granddad and his zany ways, on this beach adventure he reveals that he is 80% Viking and if anything should befall him he would want to be buried the traditional Viking way. This is useful information because while the kids are all happily playing Gordie unexpectedly passes away. Unable to rouse any grown-ups to help out, the kids set about making arrangements for their grandfather themselves. They perform a Viking burial, cremating him on a burning raft which is moving out to sea. On the kids return the news obviously causes a shock and all hell breaks loose as people come to terms with the death, and how it was dealt with.I loved this fun and touching film. Not only is it a great advert for Scotland and the beautiful scenery shown, it's also a lovely advert for life too. I went through a roller-coaster of emotions watching this film, and to be honest - I wasn't intending to watch it. This cracker just happened to be on terrestrial TV one night and I had nothing else queued up to watch, so I gave it a go. I went from wondering what the hell I had gotten myself into, through enjoyment and sadness, ending with a warm fuzzy feeling that was happy at the gift of life. It isn't necessarily a life changing story, it's more just a reminder to enjoy the fun and simple things and try to avoid stress and arguments.The acting on show is great, the adult actors in this ply their trade with class and guile - Tennant, Pike, Miller, Connolly, et al, all do a convincing and engaging job in representing their characters. Regardless of what troubles and stresses they are going through themselves - which is a lot, they are never far away from being lovable people still. Really though it's the children who do an outstanding job here; Micky (Bobby Smalldridge), Jess (Harriet Turnbull), and Lottie (Emilia Jones). It could be argued that their performances were a little squeaky clean, but there can be no doubt that they really drive the film forward with what they do. There are times they almost steal the show from their more experienced and seasoned actors with their engaging sweetness. The acting is one thing, but it's clear they are working from well written material here and have great direction, credit has to go to Jenkins and Hamilton. They have both worked on the hit BBC family comedy ""Outnumbered"" and they were able to lend their craft to a feature film really well. They have provided sharply written story which was both realistic and bordered on absurd, it had plenty of humor and pathos, and it captured attention from the audience too. While some taboos are covered in this film, they are nothing that the realty of life doesn't throw at us all, this film does it with a heart.I would be happy to recommend this family film. I didn't intend watching it but am glad I did. I am sure that anyone with a heart will find some joy from this too - oh, but bring a tissue too, just in case a tear accompanies the joy."
" The Coming of Age of Kenneth MacLeod
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,9,"Sentimental and schmaltzy, but ultimately charming movie. The real stars are the kids and none more so than background character Kenneth who is pretty much dismissed by his father throughout the movie, but makes it big with the gorgeous violinist in the party band. Really the movie is about terminal cancer sufferer Gordie MacLeod, a former professional and international footballer whose dying wish is carried out by his young grandchildren - Lottie, Mickey and Jess. This throws the who family into turmoil, no more than Gavin, Gordie's elder son who is a fairly dispicable venture capitalist.
Wonderful movie"
" Excellent story, well executed
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,10,"Not your typical story, and all the better for it, along with a great cast and fantastic scenery. Full marks to all actors, particularly the younger cast members who made this excellent drama even better. All combined, have no hesitation in giving top marks."
" A really sweet film
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,9,"'You're so English, you're almost French' - best line ever!!"
" Fantastic could have been a 10
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,8,"The script, cast, and direction all wonderful. Started great, middle both touching, philosophical, and beautiful; at the 3/4 point I was worried that they'd lost the plot, and the film was just treading water. Then the end rescued it a bit! Well done, I'm happy! Good film!!"
" MADE ME THROW UP
",2020-12-09 00:00:00,1,I WAS WATCHING THIS MOVIE AND IT MADE ME HUNGRY SO I ATE SOME COCONUT COOKIES BUT I ATE TOO MANY AND THREW UP
" What a Simple, Beautiful, Heart Warming Film
",2020-11-25 00:00:00,8,"From the very beginning, there's chaos within the family that is off to see the kids' grandpa for his 75th birthday and from there on, it's all about the kids - be it in writing, acting, dialogues and philosophy. This is a pure, sweet and wonderful family film."
" Nice Movie
",2020-11-25 00:00:00,7,"This is a nice movie, great performances especially by the children. Just be advised, this is exactly the same movie as Rocket Gibraltar with Burt Lancaster shot in the 1980's"
" Bl**dy irritating
",2020-10-14 00:00:00,1,"Staid acting. Awful language in front of kids for a kids' themed movie. Horrible, fraut and caustic atmosphere between the parents. Irritatingly predictable London based storyline. Lamentable tedium. Not good. Don't know how this got the green light."
" The Kids Are The Highlight
",2020-08-19 00:00:00,9,"I love David Tennant and Billy Connolly, so I checked this out. As always, Billy Connolly stood out, but I was really surprised by the children. I'm fairly certain half of their dialogue must have been improvised, Connolly too most likely, but they were so sharp, quick witted and funny. They were definitely the highlight of the movie, hands down.All in all, it's a sweet family movie about adults and how their problems can overtake everything sometimes and how it takes something to snap them out of it, and bring everyone together. I'd suggest this for the simple fact that it's an entertaining time."
" Funny British Comedy
",2020-08-17 00:00:00,9,This is an entertaining flick with an imaginative central premise from the beach scene onwards and great acting and quirky characterisation both before and after that scene make it well worth watching.
" A quirky, funny, holiday from hell....
",2020-08-11 00:00:00,7,"This is a well written, gently comedic and poignant look at divorce and loss that raises quite a few smiles along the way. David Tennant and Rosamund Pike are a couple with three kids who head to Scotland to meet his father ""Geordie"" (Sir Billy Connolly) to help celebrate his 75th birthday. It'd be fair to describe the adults in the film as pretty dysfunctional, saving for Connolly and Annette Crosbie (""Doreen"") who take a pragmatic, matter of fact view on life, and from whom much of the humour emanates. Grandad takes the kids for a trip to the beach and the plot hits the faintly, but engagingly, ridiculous as they all have to deal with some unexpected consequences. The performances from the three children are good; especially ""Lottie"" (Emilia Jones) and a strong cast of Scots regulars - Celia Imrie, Ralph Riach and Ron Donachie help us navigate through the selfish behaviour of the squabbling parents tempered by the innocence and common sense of their offspring. It's got some lovely scenic shots from the Gairloch and of the beautiful Wester Ross scenery and well, it's all just a bit different!"
" Refreshing
",2020-08-11 00:00:00,10,"Out of the ordinary. This movie is part of my collection for the unique story but also for the actors. Connolly is top and Tennant superb.
A must see + again and again."
" Brilliant!
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,9,"Only just watched this wonderful family film and thoroughly enjoyed it. The acting was great, particularly the children and Billy Connolly and the ideas were original. Absolutely recommend!"
" It makes you laugh and cry all in the same scene
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,10,"Hilarious, heartbreaking and wonderful from the first to the last scene. Humor that spills out of each scene and makes you laugh out loud, and the heartbreaking moments which leave you in tears just to get you back to laughter. Beautifuly done movie. Well worth watching."
" Fantastic film about real people.. Refreshing
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,10,Makes a change to see a film that has a real heartwarming story that doesn't just rely on swearing.Great acting from all the cast.
" Brilliant. Totally out of the norm.
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,10,"Great, great, great. A very unusual plot-line and stand out performances from Rosamund Pike, David Tennant and Billy Connolly. The child actors in it are fab too. Great humour, some heart rending, thought provoking, death....but dont let that put you off. Brilliant story line, brilliant acting and would watch it again. Some very clever writing. A must see :-)"
" Billy Connelly as only he can do it
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,10,"Brilliantly funny, sad and heartwarming showing the reality that's behind many people's lives as they try to be seen by others as they want to be seen. Billy did a wonderful job as his usual magnificent self."
" What's not to love!
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,9,The kids make this film their reactions just seem so natural and unforced like so many other similar films of this style. Billy Connelly was also both charming and hilarious whilst Tennant and Pike worked well off each other. It's no award winner but it's great fun and will brighten up anyone's day!
" So cute but also 'serious'
",2019-12-31 00:00:00,7,"Loved this film, it's so cute. The kids are great in it and it really carries the film. The usual message of love and family above all, is present but not in a too pushy way. Well recommended for an 'easy' evening film for the whole family."
" What we did on our Holiday
",2019-12-12 00:00:00,10,"This was a great film. It had my attention from the beginning to the end. I loved the part when everyone in the family was in the car travelling. They all fell asleep except the 6-year-old little girl. And she was holding the steering wheel driving Lol. Daddy wakes up and says why didn't you wake me up. The little girl is calm as can be and says.
""Well that would be kind of mean daddy you looked sleepy""
It was cute and adorable the way she said it.
Oh, and when Grandpa died the grandchildren
Sent him on the river on fire. Because they knew Grandpa did not want a Funeral.
Loved how they RESPECT HIS WISHES.
I also loved how Grandpa knew there was going to be a PARTY FOR HIM THAT DAY.
But what did he do. He did what a TRUE GRANDPA WANTED TO DO.
SPEND A AWESOME DAY WITH HIS GRANDCHILDREN. Just grandpa and the children. Off to have a fun-filled day. They played with animals on the beach. I had a nice big campfire. Were it said NO CAMPFIRES ALLOWED. Just a very exciting day kids go and have lots of fun and enjoy yourselves.
Those kids will never ever forget that day. They even bared grandpa up to his head on the beach. Covered in the sand you can tell those kids the young actors. I loved making that part of the film because they looked so chilled out. It looked like they were not even acting. Another reason why I Loved this Film.
One more thing normally with young actors. It is always one that steals the film. But in this film, all these kids did a fantastic job."
" Unexpectedly entertaining.
",2019-11-07 00:00:00,9,The kids in this were so cleverly funny. The whole cast works great together and I laughed so hard at moments it almost made me cry. I'm so happy I took the time to watch this.
" Feel great for a change
",2019-10-19 00:00:00,10,"We loved this film. More of this please!!!! The acting was superb, writing was wonderful and where on earth did you find those amazing children? The scenery was stunning as well. So much to love!"
" Warm hearted and heart breaking
",2019-10-14 00:00:00,9,"Life affirming and beautiful; I didn't know what to expect from this film but was totally hooked within the first 5 mins. A great story and well acted, the whole ensemble brought the viewer into their family to experience all the joy and pain that many would recognise in their own families. Billy Connolly makes a perfectly irreverent Grandfather, and the kids were a delight to watch. I laughed out loud at their many innocent questions and observations, and cried at their humble childlike reasoning for fulfilling their Grandfather's wishes. It's a story which reminds us what should be important in life and what we should let go of. Watch it, it's worth the investment."
" Such a lovely movie!
",2019-10-14 00:00:00,8,"I started watching this movie after having run out of options, but I am so glad I did. This is such a beautiful movie! The casting is just perfect. The kids, the grandfather, and everyone else's performance was just perfect! I can write a lot more about how good this movie was, but I would rather end this review by saying this - if you decide on watching this one, do it; you will be pleasantly surprised at how nice of a movie it turns out to be."
" Charmings, some laughs, mediocre
",2019-10-01 00:00:00,5,"I like David Tenannt. I didn't expect much from this & that's what I got. Adult actors didn't have much to do. the other 5 star reviews, in my opinion got it right, across the board.
my star review is 5 (10) for masterpiece, 4 (8-9) great movie
3 (6) watchable, good. 2 (4) boring give it a pass with half stars-
so at 2-1/2, there were many boring spots, predictable. the end had plot flaws, and unfortunately, were major plot points. (I wont say) - but I enjoyed some of it. not the worse I've seen in the last month.
younger, tweens should like it more. It's not sophisticated. and there is death. (grandparents, pets and these days school shooting) if you think your children are too young. something the family can watch together, altho I don't think it is meant as a kids movie."
" A Hidden Gem
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,9,"I watched this on Amazon, without first seeing a trailer, and mainly because the lovely David Tennant is in it. I expected it to be decent enough.But it exceeded my expectations in every way.Let me begin this review with the absolute stars of the show: Emilia Jones, Bobby Smallridge, and Harriet Turnbull, the three children who play the grandchildren of Billy Connolly's character Gordie. These three kids nearly carried with movie with their freshness, their moving moments, their hearts and minds, their vulnerabilities, and their hilariously well-intentioned errors of judgement. Without a doubt, the stars of the show.The other characters, every single one of them, were beautiful in their foibles and I'm so glad I saw the film. And yes, Tennant was wonderful."
" IT'S NOT GRANDAD WHO'S DEAD, IT'S THE BBC-AND BRITAIN.
",2019-09-20 00:00:00,1,"This may be a picture of dysfunctional families among the very well to do in Britain, or it may bea reflection of the eternally sophomoric, wistful crap that passes for creativity among British film/art students-but it's certainly no picture of life among the 99% in England OR Scotland.
And all the great actors involved in it have done is show that they shouldn't be trusted with picking their own scripts.
An insulting waste of time."
" Stupid Title - Excellent Movie!
",2019-09-13 00:00:00,9,From the title I thought oh another stupid family vacation movie but I love Billy Connolly so I watched it anyways. It was fantastic on so many levels!!
" Quirky feelgood movie about death and family
",2019-09-09 00:00:00,6,A light movie dealing with a broad range of adult issues movingly handled by 3 cute children. Certainly better than your average romcon and a great choice for a Sunday night cuddle on the sofa with popcorn
" Same storyline as Rocket Gibraltar
",2019-09-09 00:00:00,6,This movie was very very similar to the 1980's movie Rocket Gibraltar . Including the children spending time with their grandfather and giving him a Viking funeral when he passes away in their presence without the adults knowing.
" I wanted to like this...
",2019-09-08 00:00:00,4,Short and sweet I found the characters (not the actors) EXTREMELY annoying....The kids are way too precocious what made it almost unbearable to watch. The adult characters straddling stupidity.....I can't recommend
" I don't think this is a ""hilarious comedy""
",2019-08-16 00:00:00,5,"Warning spoilers below!I don't know how many times I've been sucked into a movie that involves cancer. There's enough sadness in real life that I avoid these types of movies. Why, you ask? Both my parents died of cancer AT A YOUNG AGE. It follows that I probably will too. Other loved ones have succumbed to the disease as well. I do feel this movie tried not to focus on the sadness, which is good, but what was the point? The grandfather got the funeral he wanted, but so what? It wasn't funny and I wouldn't have finished it, except I guess I was hoping for a semi-happy ending and there wasn't. Don't watch if you have experienced cancer first-hand."
" Never has a film deteriorated so much in the second half
",2019-08-03 00:00:00,3,"I really liked this film . Let me correct myself. I really liked half of this film . The first half is funny thanks to the kids getting all the best lines but something happens half way through in the plot that turns this from an enjoyable romp to an outright shambles. The last half hour is shockingly bad . It turns into the most sickly sweet nonsense that was trying to tug at the viewers heart string but just made me angry .
This is a film a rare film where the child actors are the stars and the adult actors ( Billy Connolly the exception ) are irritations."
" Charming
",2019-07-30 00:00:00,8,"This film very skilfully intertwines comedy with bereavement; I was surprised to find myself laughing at jokes about death. The big name actors all turn in predictably good performances whilst never trying to upstage the children (who of course steal the show). Its a very imaginative, funny and touching plot. I was enthralled."
" Fabulously touching
",2019-06-28 00:00:00,10,"There are many good family themed movies but this one managed to be perfectly hilarious but with a touch of wisdom. I especially loved how the children percieve grief, sickness and death. For them it isn't some terrible thing but merely a fact of life that adult seem to forget. As for the acting I really loved how David Tennant played Doug when he found out about his father demise.
It's realistic while still being amusing and heart touching."
" The ""Professional Critics"" are NUTS !!!!!!!
",2019-04-16 00:00:00,10,"I watched this movie, IMMEDIATELY bought a copy of the movie, and have rewatched it a number of times as well as sharing it with numerous friends. In my book it is a 10 !!!!!The script is WONDERFUL - realistic, intelligent, heartfelt, funny, and believable !!!
It doesn't insult your intelligence like most recent movies do.
The story is a joyful romp through a number of recognizable chapters of human life.
The actors - EVERY ONE of them - are PERFECT !!!!
ESPECIALLY the child actors !!!!!I have learned to totally disregard what the critics have to say.
However, I ALWAYS go to the Users' Reviews to get the real skinny.
Do yourself a favor: Disregard the CRITICS' paltry rating. Read the Users' reviews.Then enjoy a TOTAL respite from your daily grind by watching this film."
" Suspend your disbelief and you'll love it
",2019-03-24 00:00:00,9,"Watched this with my wife and 12 yr old daughter - and we absolutely loved it. Yes, a lot of the plot wound never happen in real life - but you can definitely draw parallels and see scenarios that resonate with family life and it's dynamics. The kids are the brilliant, and the overall story encompasses a lovely blend of the heartwarming, the sad and the comedic elements of a loved one's impending death.
To the makers and actors - thank you for providing us with this gem which still me makes me smile when I think of it."
" This film Surprised Me
",2019-02-14 00:00:00,9,"This movie was well Written so well, there wasn't necessarily a perfect happy ending and that made it all the better. Billy Connolly brought his A game in this film. His mix of humor and sage advice added a calmness to the movie rather than an extra anxiety about it. Where as the other adults in the film were a total calamity he was the voice of reason, along with the kids whom were emotionally mature for their age, expecially with the burning of their grandfather. The seen where they were building his raft was funny, touching and emotionally moving making you both laugh and cry at the same time. The movie was genteel in its approach upon morals and ones life, allowing each character to have its problems without preaching to them about how to solve them. Accepting the characters their flaws and all, while poking fun at them simultaneously. It was an amazing movie and inplan on watching it again."
" What We Did on Our Holiday
",2019-02-05 00:00:00,7,"I saw this film listed in the television schedules a few times over a couple of years, I was most interested because of the cast, and it was rated well by critics, so I hoped it was worth waiting for, written and directed by Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin (Drop the Dead Donkey, Outnumbered). Basically Doug McLeod (BAFTA Scotland nominated David Tennant) and his wife Abi (Rosamund Pike) have recently separated, but reunite to take their three children, Lottie (Emilia Jones), Mickey (Bobby Smalldridge), and Jess (Harriet Turnbull) with them on a holiday. They are driving from London to the Scottish Highlands to see Doug's father Gordie (Billy Connolly), who is celebrating his 75th birthday, and it may be his last, as he is dying of terminal cancer, Doug's brother, millionaire Gavin McLeod (Ben Miller) has arranged a lavish party for him. It is revealed that Doug had an affair, which lead to Abi moving out and taking legal action against him, but they do not want to upset Gordie in what could be his final months, so they ask their children not to speak about the separation. Arriving at Gordie's mansion, there is a tense rivalry between Doug and Gavin that is blatant. Despite being extremely ill, Gordie is fun-loving, and encourages his grandchildren, especially Lottie, to enjoy life while they are young. While Gavin, Doug, Abi and Gavin's wife Margaret (Amelia Bullmore) make the final arrangements for the party, Gordie takes the three children to the beach. Gordie tells the children he is descended from the Vikings, he reveals his desire to be buried ""the Viking way"", being cremated and sent out to sea. While the children are playing on the beach, Gordie dies peacefully lying on the sand. Lottie runs to tell the adults, leaving her brother and sister with Gordie's body, but when she arrives, they are arguing, with Abi admitting she also had an affair, and wants to move with the children to Newcastle. Lottie returns to the beach without telling the adults what has happened, so the children decide to fulfil Gordie's last wish, they build an improvised raft, and using petrol from Gordie's truck, they send him out to sea and set his raft on fire, ""Viking"" style. The children return home and tell the adults what has happened, they are horrified. Doug and Gavin go to the beach and find Gordie's truck submerged in the rising tide, Gavin breaks down in Doug's arms. Abi and Margaret break the news of Gordie's death to the guests, and words spreads quickly of what the children did. The police arrive to investigate, accompanied by social services worker Agnes Chisholm (Celia Imrie), who interviews the children about their actions. After speaking to Lottie, Agnes contemplates removing the children from Doug and Abi's care, while the press descends on the house and Lottie, Jess and Mickey's actions make headlines worldwide. While using Gavin and Margaret's son Kenneth's (Lewis Davie) computer, Mickey and Jess accidentally stumble upon a video of Gavin's wife Margaret in a supermarket attacking a shopper, Gavin also sees it, and was unaware of his wife's issues, a result of her depression. The press describes the children's actions as depraved, but Doug and Abi make a statement, saying that however misguided they were, they support the children's efforts to honour their grandfather, and that what they did was not malicious. Chisholm ends her investigation, having seen the support given to Lottie, Mickey and Jess, she leaves the children with their parents. Gavin and Doug hold their own memorial for Gordie at the beach, the brothers seem have buried the hatchet, while Abi tells Doug she will not be moving to Newcastle, the couple decide to have a civil divorce and apologise to their children. It ends with the extended family honouring Gordie on a hill above the beach with some friends, and then the family playfully splashing around in the water on the beach. Also starring One Foot in the Grave's Annette Crosbie as Doreen. It was nominated the BAFTA Scotland for Best Feature Film. Tennant and Pike give good performances as the unhappily married couple who try to conceal their marital strife without success, and Connolly is loveable as the grandfather in good spirits despite his illness, but it is indeed the three youngsters who steal the show. Most of the laugh-out-loud moments come from the innocent commentary and reactions from the kids, it does well at being funny, there is the tragic element of the story, but it is clever at balancing it out and making it poignant, a satisfying comedy drama. Very good!"
" A thoroughly entertaining film!
",2019-01-11 00:00:00,7,"Right, so this film has David Tennant in it. Wait, you need more?Alrighty. It is great testament to the rest of the cast that this talented actor in no way stands out and above the others; everyone does a fantastic job. Even the children (I hardly ever enjoy children in films!)This film is not beautiful. It is not thrilling. It is not particularly original, has nothing much to say about social issues of the day and does not include a plot that twists and turns with surprises. So, why have I given it a 7? In short, it is amusing (with some full-on funny moments - I'm thinking of the mention of a taser in particular), endearing and entertaining. Characters are interesting and developed, relationships are fully formed and the story explores them well.So, a very 'British film'. Strong on character, endearing and not at all spectacular or gratuitous. Fabby!"
" Unexpected funny and well made British movie
",2019-01-11 00:00:00,9,"I had earmarked this movie in my Netflix list for months and months. Finally got around to watching it last night and LOVED it. I'd never heard of it before and I don't know why because this is a British gem of a movie.First of all it's set in Scotland which I love. Beautiful cinematography and setting esp. the beach scene with the children and their Grandpa.Secondly, the acting skills of the three kids were outstandingly good. So impressed. It reminded me of Outnumbered and then when I looked it up on here it did not shock me to find out this movie is from the same writers. I don't know how they get children to act like this but it's a gift! Some of the scenes esp. with Billy Connelly and Annette Crosbie looked completely ad lib.Loved the ostrich popping up when you least expected it to. Very funny.Beautifully done all round. Very funny and poignant as well. Some good life lessons imparted."
" Cringeworthy and irritating
",2018-10-18 00:00:00,1,British and Scottish films are my fave but this was awful. Perhaps tolerable if you turn down the sound and enjoy the Scottish countryside.
" Brilliant
",2018-09-29 00:00:00,8,"A brilliant movie with humor, drama, pathos and real people. Rosamund Pike and David Tennant are exceptional as a married couple going through some serious issues. They take the kids to visit his father, the eccentric Billy Connolly. And the kids steal the show and are the most magical of all the characters. It's a lesson in living that we should all want to adopt."
" A gentle surprise.
",2018-09-25 00:00:00,9,"I really didn't think I was going to be so pleasantly surprised by this film. It begins with a family packing up to go to Scotland to visit Doug's (David Tennant) father, Gordie (Billy Connoly) who is turning 75 and on top of all, has terminal cancer. Doug and his wife (Rosamund Pike) are separating, but want to act as if nothing happens because they fear the news could be harmful for Gordie. They bring along their kids, Lottie (Emilia Jones), Mickey (Bobby Smalldrigde) and Jess (Harriet Turnbull) who are accustomed and somewhat tired of their parents constant fighting and screaming at each other. The trip to Scotland will result in a number of experiences and teachings concerning love, life, death, forgiveness and understanding.One of the things that I really enjoyed about the film is that I couldn't predict where was it going, so I was surprised when certain events took place, and astonishingly, these moments were both funny and dramatic at the
same time. The ambiguous tone of the film was highly effective, and hard to pull off so seamlessly. For me, it created a warm and cozy atmosphere that had me submerged in the plot and the development of the characters.
The cinematography was just beautiful; the filmmakers really showed Scotland off, in the best of ways. It was so complementary, that it all fell gently into place. A beautiful familiar sensation for a wonderful film.The acting was amazing, I adore David Tennant, he always puts on such phenomenal performances. Rosamund Pike was just as great; and the ones that truly steal this film are the children; at one point in the movie they alone
get plenty of screentime, it's so worthy. Billy Connoly also gives the best of him, and the rest of the cast also give a harmonious performance.Overall it is a surprisingly stunning film, it will have you putting some deep thought into it, for sure. On top of that, you will have a great time."
" Just watched a few minutes. This is funny?
",2018-09-10 00:00:00,1,"This was on US TV today, and we tuned in for a few minutes. A story about a troubled marriage is not our usual cup of tea, as my husband and I are both from broken homes, but anything that takes place in Scotland is a plus, so we gave it a go.When the social worker angle was played for laughs, that did it. These situations are a nightmare, happening right now here in the states: parents put through social services investigations because their ten-year-old children are ""unsupervised"" while playing on their own front lawns! Hah hah. Hilarious.As another reviewer noted, the mother makes a pretty speech at the end that is supposed to make everything all right. I am stunned at the number of people who think this is family entertainment."
" Fantastic Performances
",2018-07-21 00:00:00,6,"The script is pretty rubbish; it's something that was obviously written by high school students.However, the performances are fantastic. Every single actor puts in an amazing effort; and Emilia Jones is a standout, for her age.
Worth watching just to appreciate the performers. Not the story, that's awful."
" Don't miss it
",2018-07-13 00:00:00,8,"A wonderful way of story telling by bringing together a bunch of great actors.. Life is not always fair.. and you will only learn that when you are in hard times..
Very good laughs..
Billy Connolly is great as usual, besides good actors like David Tennant, Rosamund Pike, child actors did a great job.. must watch for heart warming.."
" One of the funniest movies I have watched
",2018-05-18 00:00:00,9,"Everyone knows Billy Connelly is funny and you can almost guarantee a laugh watching any movie he is in, similarly you can say it for most movies Ben Miller is in. Well that is my opinion anyway.Well forget that those two are in this one and watch this for the three funniest characters you will probably ever watch. They are all 10 years old or younger.I laughed so much in this movie and just loved it to bits.Watch it if you get the chance, absolutely hillarious."
" A picturesque, clever, meaningful yet funny gem of a film
",2017-12-26 00:00:00,10,"Today's generation gap is huge, parents find coping with with the organised chaos that is modern life an almost insuperable problem, and yet somewhere down the line kids need their parents - and hugely also their grandparents, and of course both parties can benefit if for once we just drop the stupid, profane and mostly meaningless burdens of everyday life and think about what really matters. Communing a bit with nature might do that, and from the off we know that ""What we did on our holiday"" is going to be selling the inspiringly gorgeous Scottish Highlands and Islands to us - including the midges (whose presence the film is big enough to admit to). In general, this offering both written and directed by Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin dwells a lot on peoples' lying (for a vareity of reasons), yet is supremely, at times touchingly, at times even brutally, honest in its approach. Its integrity shines through. To make this work, the makers needed two sets of messed up parents to begin with (and this job is very well done by David Tennant + Rosamund Pike, as well as Ben Miller (the best thing he's done I believe) + Amelia Bullmore. Here we have two brothers markedly different from one another plus their wives. On paper, the Miller character Gavin is more successful than that played by Tennant, but he has the small difficulty of actually explaining what he even does! Basically, he's a ""short seller"" (whatever that is), and his young nephews and nieces make the kind of innocently witty remarks on that score that you might expect - to fine good comic effect! Exactly what brother Doug does is not clear either, but both of their marriages have some issues. But the stars of this show are grandparent and kids, and here there is nothing less than dream-fulfilment, as those who have long imagined how great a slightly toned-down but still pithy Billy Connolly might prove to be get their rewards. Poor old grandad is on the way out due to cancer and he is now (on the occasion of his 75th birthday party) ready, even desperate, to communicate some of his real, fundamental thoughts about the world. He feels he's not going to do very well with his sons and daughters-in-law, but wonders if he might reach them through the kids, at the same time as reaching the kids. Ultimately, he achieves more than he bargains for, when actually dying on the beach while in those kids' company; and he thus gives rise to the film's crescendo ending (on which score I'll avoid all spoilers).Many of the lines Connolly gets to utter are just superb, and the way he puts them across likewise. It's a treat.However, as Connolly interacts magnificently with Emilia Jones as Lottie, Bobby Smalldridge as Mickey and Harriet Turnbull as the youngest Jess, even he is at the same time being upstaged by them. These kids are just splendidly talented, appealing, and extremely, extremely funny. What is more, they often convey huge meaning in what they say and do, as kids invariably will. There is total, disarming authenticity here.Lottie - being the oldest - is most affected by her parents' marital problems, and has become rather withdrawn and anxious. Seeing her transform with the events of the film is a moving and at times powerful joy to watch. More depth and reality is conveyed by Emilia Jones's performance than in many, many previous films we've seen.Indeed, comedy laugh-out-loud this may be, but we take a great deal of value and meaning from this piece if we focus in on it (and also if we perservere through a perhaps slightly unpromising-looking first few minutes).Let's face it, a family get-together in a big house in the remote and beautiful wilds of Scotland is a concept that has a lot going for it from the outset, but the gem of giving equal weight to three generations of the family (with actors truly capable of pushing that idea through), of allowing the lines to flow with such a mix of wit and wisdom, of achieving the perfect mix of physical and verbal comedy, and of pursuing a plot-line of typically British eccentricity, is a really great achievement that should not be underestimated.At moments, ""What we did on our holiday"" risks straying towards the syrupy or naive, but it mostly, mainly stays on the right side of the line. That'as deft work by the makers. The film also very wisely plays only slightly with the English-Scottish stuff, remaining good-humoured and avoiding easy laughs based around divisiveness in favour of meaningful content that Brits from Land's End to John O'Groats can readily identify with. And they certainly should do so, as the rewards are very considerable. I expected little here and got a very great deal (appropriately enough on Christmas Day). I believe many, many others will find the same as I did."
" Puts the Fun Back into Dysfunction
",2017-09-16 00:00:00,9,"The old saw is that families come together in crises, but we all know there is an equal chance that they will come apart. Rarely is it mentioned that both can occur, as is true in this gem of a movie. Even more rare is the notion of a joyous death, a death occurring in the middle of one's most cherished pursuits, spending time with grandchildren. More rare still (if not unprecedented) is that death can be celebrated with creativity and connection coming from children, who are ordinarily shielded from its realities, but who can not only rise to the occasion but, with their own mythologies, transcend it.It does not hurt that the adult cast is stellar nor does it hurt that the countryside is immeasurably beautiful nor that the child performers are the most adept wise fools and truth tellers to be seen in decades.I did not intend to write about this movie. I wanted to keep it as a secret for myself, to watch as the spirit might insist. Yet when I saw the anemic professional reviews, I felt compelled to speak up. So, if nothing else, the less than resounding applause from the professional front has shaken me loose from my selfishness and forced me to declare that all movie watchers everywhere would likely find something of delight in this film: see it!"
" We laughed out loud
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,8,"Hey! This is first review I've made on IMDb that highly rates a film. We laughed out loud at some points. Then the next morning watched the film again.The film is a bit like the BBC show Outnumbered, with parents vs children, all of whom have their comical and darker sides. The children are charming, never seeming to be acting at all, just natural. David (Dr Who) Tennant and his wife Rosamund Pike are always worth watching and a safe pair of hands for the excellent, slightly surreal and wacky script by Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin. Even Billy Connolly kerbed his often over-the-top routines and played his part well.The other actors provide a good backdrop for the film, especially Ben Millar as the OTT brother and Celia Imrie doing her pursed-lips routine in her small but effective part.This is a family film that should be a delight for everyone."
" Brit Bickersons
",2017-06-16 00:00:00,4,"What We Did On Our Holiday is one of those ""dysfunctional"" family films, the positive ending of which can be spotted in the first half hour. The film, by a pair of Brit sitcom writer/directors, has garnered some positive reviews and I'm a fan of David Tennant - I just saw him in Don Juan in Soho when I was in London - but I found most of the characters here just irritating, especially the trio of precocious and potentially neurotic kids who never seem to have heard the word ""no.""The plot does indeed chronicle the London family's Scotland holiday to visit the husband's brother and father. A running gag is the attempt to keep the couple's upcoming divorce hush-hush. But of course the kids are not good at keeping secrets of any kind, or at keeping their mouths shut at all.Additional complications involve the feisty, free spirited grandfather who is in the last stages of cancer. Then, as one of the reviews noted, ""it gets weird."" Part of the weirdness arises from the son's obsession with Vikings and from his watching the historical epic, The Vikings, on TV. (It might be noted that this film raised the bar for graphic violence in mainstream films in 1958. There is even an in-joke when a bit from the musical score, the Viking horn call, is quoted).Finally the kids come up with an unusual way to deal with the grandfather's death, a solution which one would think might have serious legal consequences (which are briefly raised but finally just dismissed). But certainly the groundwork for years of therapy and analysis has been laid, issues which are blithely ignored in the final cheery conclusion set to feel-good blue grass music.A sequel dealing with the characters years down the line might prove more interesting than this weird-ed-out Holiday."
" 6 and a half stars for me!
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,6,"I love the oldest daughter with the notepad and the comment she made to her dysfunctional parents, 'I'm ready to document all the lies you're going to tell me, so I can remember them'...something of that nature. I loved how the kids took charge and made decisions for themselves albeit they were choices that they heard coming from their grandfather's mouth. They wanted to respect his wishes. In the end, I liked the fact that they said 'nothing really matters' and I can relate because it's where we've been to where we are going. Nothing in between matters if it is not a fond or cherished memory. Let's see how far we've come and how far we go. Their accents were from Europe, so a bit challenging here in America."
" Quirky family comedy hits the spot
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,7,"If you liked Outnumbered on TV, you'll probably like this. Trio of kids from dysfunctional London family head to Scotland for grandad's birthday. Not usually my cup of tea, but script and director get it right. The children have a believably offbeat take on reality, talking and doing as they would, and not as adults think they should. Tennant and Pike spark off each other as couple on verge of nervous break-up. Connolly is the perfect reprobate ancient. The host family exhibit a typical kind pomposity that is easy to lampoon. A relaxed pace that builds to a good comedy climax. The film steers clear of the chaos that such films sometimes court. I was pleasantly surprised. Worth watching!"
" Utterly perverse
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,1,"I have submitted several reviews to this site, all accepted, but never before have I rated a film nought out of ten.K... so the concept not of reporting the death of your grandfather to you parents etc. but giving him a Viking burial, because one of the children has, however they came by them, Viking values, should not have legal consequences is improbable enough but it is also in my view perverted. The only good thing I can say about this film is that it is about the best argument for staying single and without children I have ever come across. Or at least staying away from becoming entangled with middle- class London women, even if they are as pretty as Rosamund Pike. Nuff said."
