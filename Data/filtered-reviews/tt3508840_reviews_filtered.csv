" A beautiful martial arts ballet
",2020-08-13 00:00:00,8,"Nie, a professional assassin, has a mission to kill a political leader, however, her past comes to the fore to torment her, which jeopardizes her goal. It is not a typical martial arts film, quite the contrary. The central theme is the battle for power in a old China, in transition from Dynasties. The choreographies of the fight scenes are very well executed, in such a smooth and beautiful way that I do not remember seeing in recent films, which remind us of the ""ballets"" of the great classics. The photography uses an very attractive color scheme, and the camera angles and the use of wide and close shots transmits to the viewer the feelings of the characters on screen, which makes the narrative more interesting."
" Slower than the slowest
",2020-07-17 00:00:00,5,"It may be good for those people who appreciate arts in films. But, for the general audience, it is painfully slow. The screenplay just focuses on literally everything other than the plot, the plot stands still. Looking at the plot, it should have been done around 1 hour, but they have made it a hour and forty six minutes. The plot is failed assassination by a lady assassin, due to emotional connections. Better not to see it, the good thing is Cinematography. It literally looks like seventh Century China though."
" ""The Assassin"" is kind of misleading, but an alright film
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,7,"The Assassin (2015)This is the first Taiwanese movie that I've ever seen, although it was also filmed in mainland (PRC) China and Japan. It wasn't as flashy or action-packed as some of the Hong Kong, or mainland Chinese movies.Normally the bubbly film star Shu Qi is playing a subdued assassin Nie Yinniang. She hardly has more than a few lines of dialog. Her character is rather sad too. Most of the other characters are featured more prominently, but even they are more concerned with being Yinniang's next victim."
" Intuitive cinema.
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,9,"It's one of those films that although it's not your cup of tea, you appreciate it and love it for the way that it makes you feel - do not think, feel it.I thought that this was gonna be very boring but it turned out to be quite interesting. It's interesting in the way that it challenges you to keep up with it. It never shows you much, but it shows enough for you to crawl behind it until the end without exhausting you.While watching it, Wong Kar-Wai's films came to mind. Much like in Kar-Wai's films, especially In The Mood For Love, the set decoration, the costumes and the cinematography are absolutely gorgeous, but more than that, all of the above it's elevated even higher when used with such symbolism. It is a stunningly beautiful film to look at but not for the sake of looking beautiful, it has depth in every frame.I hadn't heard of this director before but after watching this film I would certainly look on his other work. I'm very impressed by him, by the way of how aware he is on what he's doing - this is his last film and the man has made a lot of them, and you can see the whole experience that comes with it in The Assassin.The film it is very gloomy, off putting and daring, but if you let yourself to truly dive into it, it rewards you."
" A beautiful piece of art.
",2020-05-12 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed this movie. The cinematography is absolutely stunning, as is the sound editing and mise-en-sc√®ne.
This truly is a piece of art."
" A grossly overestimated Chinese film
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,2,"Excellent cinematic can not compensate for the painfully slow story telling. The female assassin wrestled with her morality and duty. To kill or not to kill, that is the question. I felt, it lacked in substance. I would describe it as a pseudo art film for western film lovers/critics. It is not everyone's cup of tea."
" A Picasso of a movie
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,10,Exhilarating rollercoaster ride from start to finish.
" Martial Arthouse
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,7,"Only a few fight scenes with gorgeous shots of nature & Chinese architecture. Great sound design as well. Even though this film is deliberately slow, which worked for most scenes, it still could've been edited down just a bit. Story was also a little hard to follow and it kind of just ends. But the cinematography is top notch."
" Dull and Disappointing
",2019-11-06 00:00:00,4,"As my first Hou Hsiao-Hsien movie, ""The Assassin"" was not a good example of his work; and at first, it gave me the wrong impression of him. And although I don't consider him a great director, Hsien's has made some excellent movies, admittedly more bad than good, but still, ""The Puppetmaster"", ""A City of Sadness"", ""Three Times"" and ""Millenium Mambo"" prove he has talent. However, ""The Assassin"" is not in that group of his rare masterpieces.For one thing: the film is only 1 hour and 45 minutes, but feels stretched out. The film is mostly talking about nothing, the dialogue is terrible and unmemorable, the characters are paper thin, and the film relies on it's beautiful visuals. And while those visuals are astonishing, it doesn't make up for an empty experience.The film's only saving graces are the performances and visuals; however, they don't save the movie from being a boring mess. The idea's also admittedly interesting, but it's bogged down by repetitive storytelling and long instances of nothing happening for the sake of being ""artsy"".This would've worked out a lot better as a short film; but sadly, it had to include many scenes of filler, and Hsien let his style get in the way of the story. If it was 40-minutes or so, it would have turned out a lot more interesting."
" Pretty but too hard to bear
",2019-09-11 00:00:00,3,"I watched halfway and just couldn't get into it. Pretty sets and costumes and endless revelations that Yiangyan, the woman in black, had returned home. Pretty much every scene until I couldn't take anymore was a bunch of difficult to identify, never mind relate to, state this slowly and dramatically to the sound of either slow beating drums or birds tweeting. Followed by long periods of silent intense staring by said characters..."
" Bored to death.
",2019-08-12 00:00:00,4,"'The Assassin (2015)' is an art-film disguised as a 'martial arts epic'. It's a beautifully shot piece filled with occasionally brilliant visuals (the best of which probably being thick mist slowly rolling over the side of a mountain) but it's almost painfully slow and seemingly slim from a story perspective. It doesn't help that it's just plain confusing, with most of the relatively simple plot being conveyed through exposition. Seriously, the characters rarely do anything of note on screen; they do it off screen, just before we see them tell someone else about it. The narrative isn't impossible to figure out - in fact, I'm pretty sure I understand it fully - but, considering what it is, it's weirdly complicated in its delivery. I mean, why should a more-or-less straight-forward drama be a puzzle for most audiences? It doesn't help that the piece goes to almost no lengths to create a sense of empathy with any of its characters. The protagonist, especially, is emotionless. This is obviously by design but it still seems rather stilted and causes a dissonance between those in the frame and those in front of it. Thankfully, our hero has a clearly defined, if small, arc and is as interesting a screen-presence as we're given. This doesn't combat the almost complete lack of entertainment, though. Neither do the impressive visuals or brief bursts of relatively lacklustre action. The feature is just a drag, one with an uninteresting story and an almost pretentious penchant for long shots of flowing silk or flickering candles. Apparently, you have to watch it more than once to truly appreciate its narrative; when it's as boring as this, why would you want to? 4/10"
" interesting movie
",2019-07-28 00:00:00,9,"I really liked this movie, and would have loved giving it a 10 but, it's really hard to follow and I don't see anyway in the world to watch this movie just once and picking up on what's happening, it would have been really tops if they had better explanations as to what was going on. but regardless, I don't mind watching a movie more than once and I didn't mind doing some research to understand better what was going. I like this movie."
" my notes
",2019-07-22 00:00:00,1,"Wow. most boring movie ever. started watching it fast about 20 minutes into it, and i was still so bored. after 45 minutes i gave up and skipped to the fight scenes. but there were almost no fight scenes, and the ones that were in the movie were horrible. there was almost no musical score. there were so many pointless overly extended shots. like way way way overly extended. like imagine you think they stayed on a shot for too long, then multiply that length of time by 4. it was unbelievable at times. and most of those shots weren't even interesting. just a shot of a character for 20 seconds, not saying or doing anything. critics be crazy sometimes (1 viewing)"
" Slow and beautiful
",2019-06-29 00:00:00,7,"For hardcore action martial arts fans this is not. This is a movie about the spirit of martial arts. It's enphasis lies on the build ups to the fights and the after effects, the fight itself is over in seconds.The locations are gorgeous as are the costumes full of colour and accuracy of the Tang Dynasty.The movie itself is very quiet, with sometimes only the ambient sounds of the environment and the movie itself runs at a glacial pace. Sometimes there will be no dialogue for as long as 10 minutes, not a classic wuxia film you may be used to.A film to watch when you want to absorb yourself into a world."
" Marvelous but unintelligible
",2019-04-30 00:00:00,6,"The movie is filmed with a very good hand in camera, direction, saturated in color and b/w scenes, all is almost perfect.
Not too much fantasy, apart some very few jumps or hops that land feather like but none of the impossible kung-fu moves we are accustomed in last 20 or more years of martial arts movies.
Dialogues are very little, another custom of those kind of movies.
Nonetheless, trying to pay the maximum attention to movie and words (captions), I ended up without barely understanding who's who and what's going on. Names and characters are not made clear and obvious visually and namely.
So, even if the movie itself is very enjoyable and recommendable for the visual part, it becomes unintelligible (and so a bit boring) for the plot part. A pity."
" Beautiful but rather boring and hard to follow
",2019-02-12 00:00:00,6,"I wouldn't call ""The Assassin"" a bad fim - in fact, it's a very good one in many ways. The production-design and cinematography are fantastic, and there's a surreal quality to the film which makes watching it a dreamlike experience.And dream, you might! Because, however exciting the story might sound on paper - ""Female assassin vows revenge!"" - this film will likely put many viewers to sleep.This aspect of the film is both problematic and interesting, as strange as that may seem. The fact is, the filmmakers have found a deeply idiosyncratic way to tell this story. What might be a standard Asian samurai epic in other hands becomes something more of a dreamlike fable, due to the fact that the film simply refuses to give us the standard beats that we expect.So, imagine a film of action and intrigue. Now imagine that almost all of the action takes place offscreen, except for one or two quick scenes which are quite potent in their impact. Also, imagine that most of the intrigue takes place offscreen as well. So, what you are left with is a series of scenes which take place in personal chambers and courtyards, often involving strained marital relations or blossoming affections, in which the story seems to be unfolding far in the background. Also, imagine that unspecified lengths of time pass between each of these scenes, during which any number of developments might have happened, and that these developments will only be alluded to in subtle, contextual ways by the characters - and yet, in order to understand where the ""plot"" goes next, you must be able to read and understand these signals.What's funny is, the actual story doesn't SEEM to be all that complicated - that is, provided that I undersood most of it. It's just that the entire thing is related in such a tangental, offhand way, it becomes fairly tiresome to try and keep up - especially when so much of the film is dominated by long, lingering, wordless, enigmatic shots.So that's ""The Assassin"" in a nutshell. I found it to be like a gorgeous, pleasant dream that I certainly didn't mind having - and yet couldn't quite explain upon awakening."
" Welcome Contrast to Hyperactive Cinema
",2019-02-12 00:00:00,8,What beautiful breaths of fresh air! Every scene is a study in cinematic art. Like a tour through a museum's room of masterly paintings when the subjects of the paintings come to life. Their story emerges but does not flail away at the viewer. It is as if the viewer is eavesdropping on the characters and must fill in the story line with deduction. The experience goes deep into the senses and lingers for days.
" how honour can change one's life mission
",2018-11-05 00:00:00,10,"Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it is more of a case study than a movie about how to save face and survive. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. The use of great cinematography and other great camera angels really help make this movie hit all of its basis. All in all I would give this five out a possible five stars.

" Slooooowwweeeeesssstttttt mooooovvvvviiiieeeeeee eeeeeevvvvveeeeerrr
",2018-10-22 00:00:00,2,What a waste of ~ 2 hours.... could have easily been a 5-10 min YouTube video...
" Slow beauty
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,7,"Definitely slow, enough to take the time to enjoy the view. Simple but good story. Martial art is like Kill Bill, not Bruce Lee."
" Painfuly slow, but so beautiful
",2018-09-28 00:00:00,6,"The camera lingers on a woman, sitting on a bed, partially obscured by silk sheets that blow gently in the wind. The sheets drift apart and for a moment you see her face, contemplative. In a word, this is this film in a nutshell - contemplative.To dispense with any misunderstanding, perhaps brought about by the title, or the brief description and the intense looking protagonist on the cover art, this is not a martial arts action film. The story contained within is a twisted intrigue of politics intertwined with an ill-fated love story and a young woman in emotional turmoil. There are a handful of beautifully choreographed scenes of combat, but in between lie long partitions of setting, silent physical drama and awkward monologues.Making use of some of the most spectacular scenery in cinema, parts of the film have the feel of a cultural documentary. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to think that probably a third of the movie is setting shots of forest, lakes, trees, mountains, hills, goats, people's faces while they do something with their hands off camera, people walking, more people walking, people dancing, buildings at night, buildings in the day, buildings at sunset, buildings at sunrise, grass, person walking in grass, unknown person standing in trees, person looking surprised, then walking away... It's boring, it's beautiful and features some impressive mastery of camera work, lavish costumes and sets that are beautiful but it's also tedious.
If viewing a film of this kind for the first time, a person may find it difficult to follow, not because the story is complex but because the story is thinly exposited between lengthy shots that establish very little if anything at all. Subsequently it is easy to lose interest between the action scenes and get lost in the cultural documentary that parses several critical events.There is an audience for this type of a film - who is looking for something without hollywood glitz, who's tired of the over-the-top melodrama of western politics, who want something beautiful and slow and most importantly is familiar with enough Chinese culture to be able to infer the significance of seemingly pointless scenes. For example, there is something deliberate in seeing a random woman you're sure you've never seen before, standing in a forest, doing nothing. Maybe there's some significance to her gait, because she's a well known actress, and that's supposed to reveal an important relationship to another character. Is that exciting to you? Then sit back and get ready to watch a lot of people who stand there and say nothing, or participate in mundane everyday life events without an explanation. If you can decipher such curious camera angles and what's not shown or even talked about, you too can infer the meaning of this film, which isn't that mind-blowing when you do, but it's fun to participate along the way. While you're doing so, try not to be distracted by the film ration spontaneously switching from 4:3 to 16:9, that just happens... or does it?"
" Boring But good looking
",2018-09-22 00:00:00,3,"Good costumes, propp and interesting scenery, But on the otherhand Its one of the most boring Movits that ive seen and the sound of crickets on repeat every time theres Nice scenery outside doesnt help"
" Do not watch late at night like I did.
",2018-09-10 00:00:00,5,"Following great critics reviews and a promissing trailer I felt in the trap of buying the blue ray for this movie. I am just glad blue rays are nowadays cheap in comparison to some years ago. The trailer is not a representation of the movie, the trailer makes you think this is an action movie, fast pace and very interesting but the movie is slow, very slow pace and very uninteresting. And if you watch this late at night like I did there is the high risk that you'll end up nodding off for a few times. 
It's not only that the pace is very slow but everything is made worse by a confusing plot and cold, uninteresting and souless characters. I just couldn't follow it, by the end I didn't know who was who, their relationship, what they were doing or why but I just didn't care. 
Some movies you need to watch them a second time to truly appreciate them, I don't know if this is the case. I will give it another look sometime but my first impression is that I think the director was trying to be like the master of boring ridiculous cinema the notorious over rated Theo Angelopoulus. Yes, those pointless long shots where nothing happens and doesn't add anything to the plot or add any meaning. At least this chinese movie has great photography unlike Theo's. And at least this movie doesn't last long unlike Theo's."
" Disappointing
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,5,"In 9th century China during the Tang Dynasty, the title character (played by Shu Qi) is a young woman who is trained and assigned to murder a government official in a rebellious province. The official happens to be her cousin.""The Assassin"" is a feast for the eyes and ears. The sound effects beautifully express the wind in the nature scenes and occasional music. The cinematography complements the many beautiful nature scenes as it does for the movie's beautiful interior sets and stunning costumes. For these crafts, the film deserves to win many awards and other forms of recognition.However, such elements cannot make a film great by themselves; they can only upgrade it to a higher level e.g. they could elevate a good film to a very good one.Subtle and slow films can definitely have a lot of impact but to do so, they require extra effort by the actors to express a deep interior life. None of the performances are bad by any means; they just lack that extra heft that is needed to maintain a viewer's interest despite being surrounded by so much beauty. The story itself was also too thin. Sadly, ""The Assassin"" does not meet its potential."
" ""The way of the sword is pitiless.""
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,5,"A film critic from the Chicago Tribune calls this ""the most rapturous martial arts film ever made."" I don't think he watched the picture, or if he did, may have felt compelled to offer a glowing review just to get it off his plate. As others have noted on this board, the picture moves excruciatingly slow, so much so that without exaggeration, every single scene could have been lessened by half and you would still have had the same movie without losing any of it's continuity. But then it would have come in at under an hour and wouldn't have qualified to be called a full length movie.I would also call into question whether this was a martial arts movie, as there was really no martial arts in it, only occasional sword play at the hand of the protagonist Yinniang (Qi Shu). And her role as the assassin of the title was severely compromised when she failed at two missions. Maybe failed isn't the right word, she declined to kill two targets because both were family men, including her former betrothed. In reading the FAQ page for the picture, a number of interpretations come into play, though to my mind, it simply appeared that Yinniang didn't have the stomach for killing. Often the simplest explanation is the best and most accurate.The one thing I will say in favor of the film is the fact that the actress Qi Shu is the most attractive woman I've sever seen in a martial arts picture, or any Chinese genre picture for that matter. Even with her emotionless face, she exhibited a serene inner and outer beauty. Unfortunately, it's not enough to save the picture, especially one in which your principal character simply walks off camera as it comes to an end."
" style over substance
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,3,"The costumes felt a bit anachronistic and i couldn't tell any of the ladies in courtly dresses apart. the hairstyles and make-up didn't ring 8th century china, either. the plot is meandering, the dialogues and the interractions between the characters lackluster at best.i couldn't exactly follow the plot: why was the seer assassinated? why did the nun suddenly change her mind? how do they shift between so many places and palaces? no sense of setting whatsoever, except for some nature shots which were made to appear breathtaking, but only fueled my disappointment and rage at the overall blandness of the plot.if you'd like to watch a series of vignettes in an exotic locale with some autumnal vibes and relatively recognisable close-ups of asian-style makeup, this is for you. if you're here for the characters, for the dialogues, for the plot, for the emotions - feel free to leave."
" Visual Masterpiece
",2018-04-02 00:00:00,10,"Often, we hear, regarding a film, that the screenplay was not tidy, the story was non-existent, the pacing was slow et cetera. Why yes, the story of the film is very much the crux of any film, it is, however, possible to achieve greatness without much of a story per se. Hou Hsiao-Hsien's The Assassin not only makes that possible but becomes a marvel at it. It is the sheer beauty of each frame that makes you forget about the story. Each frame, in itself, is a story. You do not mind the snail's pace of screenplay as you do not want the frame in front of your eyes to pass. You gorge them. This rare feat makes The Assassin one of the truest visual poetry.For it is poetry. Most of the time we treat the film like a novel. Films are indeed often a visual mean of storytelling. In that regard, it becomes as engrossing as a great story should be. But, films can be a mean of poetry too. Poetry need not have three acts, great characters or a fine climax. Poetry is a beautiful encapsulation of moments, that is to be felt. Hou's The Assassin is just that.
However, it doesn't mean that there is no premise whatsoever for the film. There is. Based on a martial arts story by the same name as our protagonist, this wuxia fiction set in 8th century Tang dynasty is centered around the titular assassin, Nie Yinniang. In the very first wonderfully shot black and white couple minutes, we were shown Nie Yinniang's capability as well as her humane side. Upon this, she was sent, as an attempt to strengthen her resolve, to assassinate the governor who was her cousin and also once betrothed.The tale is told with touch of magnificence. Director Hou's vision seeps in each frame of the film. As a result, the viewers would also be immersed, if they have the patience for it. By now, it is quite evident that the cinematography of the film is drop-dead gorgeous. Mark Lee Ping Bin's camera performs a key role in the muted yet enigmatic atmosphere of the film.The film is as well shot as it is well acted. Shu Qi, as the protagonist Nie Yinniang, was pivotal in her performance as the film centered around her character. Her nuance is instinctive, movements swift and emotions passionate. She depicts the conflict within Yinniang as deftly as she does in the orchestrated fighting sequences.The Assassin is a visual masterpiece, a glowing example of art-house cinema."
" A film that definitely stands out from the rest, in a good way.
",2018-02-11 00:00:00,8,"""The Assassin"" is much better than most of the clich√©, mindless, action movies produced in China. Of course, there are great films made in China such as John Woo's ""Hard Boiled"", ""The Killer"", and ""Red Cliff Pt. 1 and 2"", and Wong Kar Wai's ""The Grandmaster""; these are just a few.One way that it stands out greatly is the cinematography. Every scene from start to finish is a visual ecstasy that enchants the audience, making them anxiously wait for a new surprisingly beautiful shot. The contrast is sharp but not in the repelling way a YouTube amateur action film is; it captures the light and dark perfectly. Hsiao-Hsen Hou shows her proficiency in contrast from the very beginning which is in black and white. The light and dark were balanced and gave depth to the scene. When the movie was displayed in full color, I was blown away. She adhered to the color wheel to combine opposing colors in the frame, adding color to the contoured contrast and creating a beautiful shot.The composition of the shots were also great. Hou used the set design and camera positioning to lead the audience's eye to the subject. I also appreciated the masterful long takes. A big problem with most movies is they cut too soon. A movie doesn't have to be like ""Russian Ark"" where the entire film is one take. If the camera stays where it is long enough, the audience will be able to find meaning from what the characters are feeling and what their surrounding environment is like; if that perspective changes, we start all over.This ties in with some complaints that ""The Assassin"" moves too slowly. There were times that I got tired, but I realized that maybe there's more to this scene where not a single character talks. Maybe if I observe the characters and environment carefully, I can get my own meaning out of it.The acting was great, and the characters were easy to understand even when they weren't speaking to each other. Also the set design was superb. All shots were realistic and on-site, the natural landscapes and man-made structures were magnificent, and it really immersed me into the film.""The Assassin""'s writing is unconventional but well done, where much of the communication is through reading emotions. The characters don't say what they mean a lot of the time, but they communicate the truth from their unrelenting emotions caused by trying to deal with moral conflicts and dilemmas that they can't show to society. Many conflicts don't get resolved, characters are bound by societal demands, and the pain stays. One critique I can think of for this film is parts of the score. There was a fight scene that had a soundtrack that I thought was ill-fitting. It's probably because its composition was too complex for the time period and was paired with indigenous instruments meant for a simplistic, East Asian pace of music. This is only a minor concern and I didn't subtract an entire star just for this criticism.Overall it was a great movie: unconventional, experimental, beautiful, and emotionally realistic; ""The Assassin"" definitely stands out from others in the East Asian cinema, in the best way."

" A Delightfully Tranquil Experience
",2017-09-29 00:00:00,8,"Typically I've found, when a lot of critics praise a film, it often isn't that good. I'm however glad to say that is not the case with The Assassin, a film I was looking forward to watching. Despite been classified as an 'action' film, the feature often works best as a political period piece, anyone looking for a martial-arts epic perhaps wanting to focus their attention elsewhere. That being said, the fight scenes, though usually short lived, are beautifully choreographed, occasionally appearing more like a dance, sweeping you away with their gracefulness.The film centres around our self-titled assassin, Yinniang (Shu Qi), who is hailed as been 'unmatched' by her teacher, Jiacheng (Sheu Fang-yi), who took her away when she was a child and trained her in the arts of fighting. From her piercing, thousand yard stare, her straight posture and deft touch, there is never a moment when you don't believe Yinniang to be who she is, her calculated movements making her appear like water on screen. For someone who is so lovely (and tiny), Ms. Qi is phenomenal, there been moments when you can't help but shiver as she stares into the camera and right into you, eliciting the same fear her victims no doubt feel.Though Yinniang says barely a syllable throughout the film, on the rare occasion when she does speak, you are given the rarest glimpse of her compassion and humanity. Her sympathetic heart is the reason her master gives her the mission of assassinating Weibo's governor, Tian (Chang Chen), who was once her former intended husband when Yinniang was a child, Jiacheng believing the completion of this task will make Yinniang undefeatable in battle.The environments and set pieces are vivid and gorgeous, showing a delicate, flourishing world of colour and tranquillity, while the costumes are as elegant as they are majestic. Despite the film centring on a professional killer, the film does not rely on any blood, nor is there any sexual content of any kind.Moreover, the music accompanies the scenes well, though does not appear to centre around any characters or themes. The Assassin however is more a visual spectacle than anything else, one of those rare films you may need to watch more than once, in order to truly see all that the director intended, even the subtlest of images having a great impact, while the occasional use of black and white helps depict the different seasons in Yinniang's career.Themes of honour, jealousy and family occasionally feed into the narrative, and though these required more depth, there is no denying their importance during certain scenes, though the concept of black magic seemed unusually out of place. The same level of depth could have additionally been applied to some of the feature's secondary characters, whose intentions we only begin to briefly understand.Towards the end, an anti-climatic resolution presents itself to the audience, the story continuing long after the credits role, enabling the viewer to create their own particular ending to fit the leads. Considering the exactness of much of the feature, it is a little disappointing that we are provided an end that is, although conclusive, far from definitive."

Very s...l...o...w (can be edited out at least 30 minutes of unnecessary prolong scenes that add nothing more to the story), and NOT particular interesting. Simple story line but, unfortunately, telling in a complicated way with many (unnecessary) characters. The background drum beats are not only annoying but also noticeably a poor copycat of Tan Dun's ""Hero"" (so does the ""guqin"" string instrument music - down to the notes).A thought-provoking movie is one thing, a hard to understand, hard to follow to a point of losing interest movie is another thing. This movie is like a concept tryout... an in-development footage. Needs to be more thoroughly thought out to be a polished product.The only attraction is Shu Qi, and even she can't save its boringness.All style, no substance. Pleasant to the eyes, but nothing for the mind."
" Not the sum of its parts
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,5,"Well I must admit I was misled by the Title of the movie and was expecting an action flick, still I watched the whole thing and was very disappointed. In my opinion ""The Assassin"" tries to be too many things at once; it tries to have action in it but fights are short and few (if well choreographed), it tries to be a drama but it never made me care enough for any of the characters or what happens to them and finally it actually provokes amazement and wonder with it's locations and general cinematography, but sadly it's not enough to make the movie entertaining. It felt more like a 2 hr slideshow of landscapes than a movie. I know there are people that will appreciate it in some way, but I'm sure they studied cinematography or are related to the subject in some way, the rest of us will find it slow and boring, no matter how visually beautiful it may be."

",2017-03-23 00:00:00,7,"Honestly I wasn't sure how to feel about this film after seeing it. It looks absolutely gorgeous. The cinematography and production design are really top notch. If I were to judge the merits of this film based purely on its visuals, then I think I'd give it something closer to a 9 or 10. The visuals also comprise some of the best parts of the story telling. Occasionally the film will present an image without context, only to later have the meaning of that image revealed by a character in whatever dialogue driven scene will directly follow that image. It's pretty neat and adds an nice component to the visual splendor beyond simply the surface level appeal. This element of the visual element of the film though, does hint at what is probably this film's greatest weakness. In the same way that one can become really confused when viewing some of the key images without their meaning revealed until after their presentation, the story of the film as a whole is potentially incomprehensible. I don't think it's because it's necessarily too complicated either. It seems more like the director had no patience for conveying information to the audience. There are key pieces of exposition early on which are never referenced again and that you could easily miss if you aren't laser focused from minute one. This is a problem throughout the film and it's not even limited to expository dialogue. There is one scene in particular when two characters are having what I assume was a deadly showdown. Again, visually very nice. The problem though, was that I couldn't tell who one of the character's was, if they had been mentioned/featured in the film previously, or why the fight was even really happening to begin with. It's honestly really frustrating, because this film seems to squander so much of the potential I see in the visual elements for reasons that I can't understand. The incomprehensible nature of the story is frankly needless, and I think it severely limits the amount of people who can truly enjoy it. I like a lot of it, and I might watch it again in the future. I think before I recommend it though, I should preface that recommendation by saying that you can't let your attention falter for even a moment, lest you lose track of the narrative completely."
" There's slow and then there's...
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,3,"I love martial arts movies. Always have. And there are some great ones out there: Hero, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, House of Flying Daggers etc The Assassin can not in any way be classed as a great movie - only because of the ridiculous slow pace. There's slow, and then there's this. It's cringeworthy how slow it is in places. I even, on occasion, counted the number of seconds when nothing happens and it came to 5-10 seconds, when nothing, literally nothing happens. The viewer is left frustrated. I can understand that a slow pace is common in 'arthouse' movies, but even then there is usually something happening even if there is no dialogue. Frustrating, pointless, and an empty experience. Watch something else..."
