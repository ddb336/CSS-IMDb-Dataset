" Arrgh
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,2,Horrible movie.Nothing about this movie stood out.It's just an alien movie about a kid that gets to meet an alien. (E.T.).A wasted attempt for an alien movie.Verdict: When THIS alien invades the DVD player EJECT! EJECT! EJECT!
" A good movie
",2021-02-11 00:00:00,8,"This movie is criminally underrated. It's really great, and I think it deserves more attention."
" Sweet adventure for kids and some adults
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,10,"Jim Parsons and Rihanna's characters give this animated kids movie a relationship that is the center conflict in a somewhat simple alien invasion story. Steve Martin provides excellent humor as silly Captain Smek. The first time I saw it, I was blown away by how the animators and voice actors combined skills to make this a favorite of mine. It is easy to watch, and emotional at appropriate times."
" Love it
",2021-01-07 00:00:00,10,"Such a cute, funny movie. One I can watch over and over."
" Forced colonization is not funny.
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,2,"Making world domination, being forcibly removed from ones home, forced into internment camps, and ""taking care of the lesser species"" seem some much cuter with flashy graphics, ""cute"" aliens, and warm music.
There are better ways to teach a message."
" A wonderful surprise
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,9,"Caught this on Christmas television and was delighted and charmed by it. A talented voice cast, good jokes and satisfying pay-offs. Great for kids and grownups who are kids."
" Such a cute movie
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,9,"I don't know why this movie didn't get better reviews. I think it's adorable, has good music, and it's one of those you can watch more than once."
" Great Family Movie
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie today with the kiddies. I would say it is a really solid movie. It is the story of an unlikely friendship that forms when an outcast alien meets a sassy little girl on a mission to find her mom. I think the story is well thought out and there are many hidden life ""gems"" noted within. The theme of judging others sticks out as well as themes of ""being yourself"" and learning from your mistakes. It is a little predictable but I think all adults feel that way about children's movies. The acting was good and surprisingly Rihanna did very good (I had my doubts about that). The kids loved it and laughed a lot. They also enjoyed the music a lot and that is really what it is all about. I would recommend it for families."
" Gets way too much hate than it deserves
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,7,"Not the best movie ever, but I think it's decent. I don't know why but lately everyone seems to be hating on it. It isn't as bad as people say it is. Again, not the best movie ever and I think if you want to find the perfect movie to watch with your family, you might wanna skip this one, but when you have a chance, watch it and see how you like it.I USED to like this movie when I was younger, now I think it's just decentMaybe it isn't your cup of tea, and that's okay. But just give it a try if you have time"
" I haven't laughed like this in a long time
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,8,"Don't listen to the haters. Watch this movie. I haven't laughed like this in a long time, and the music is spot on."
" BOOVTASTIC!!!
",2020-10-09 00:00:00,10,Not only is this movie hilarious but it has awesome characters a great cast and an amazing story it's honestly a fantastic movie 10/10
" It's meh
",2020-09-23 00:00:00,6,"It has a great idea but it feels like it's missing something. With that being said it's not awful, far from it. It's just meh and boring at times. I remember being interested at first but the plot begins to lag on at times which takes you out of the story. There're some funny moments between the two characters but aside from that, it's just meh.It's definitely not one of dreamworld' best. While you can watch it if you have kids, I'd say skip it and watch something classical like shrek instead."
" Truly astonishingly plain
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,5,"I've got nothing else, so I just have to fill my review with this sentence."
" Bad grammar and bad characters
",2020-07-15 00:00:00,4,"Rather unique story and good main character in Tip (although is Gratuity a real name??) but all the aliens speak in bad grammar which makes me NOT want to show it to my kids ever again - how counterproductive to have them teach ""I want to"" for months and months only to have a silly cartoon teach them ""I wants"" within seconds because someone thought it was funny....Al the other characters are dumb. Either selfish or stupid or both - nothing wants me to care for them. Tip is the only one I care about because she makes sense.Movie drags on a little towards the end too and someone tries to throw all the music into your face as a selling point. There are sometimes 2-3 songs in a single scene!I can see the production value and it's watchable but very forgettable."
" Ok
",2020-07-09 00:00:00,6,The movie is fine to watch with good animation. Not the best movie from DreamWorks but a good time
" Supremely Delightful
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,9,"I can't wrap my head around the negative reviews because I found this film clever, refreshing, touching, hilarious and entertaining!! I vote for a sequel!"
" ABSOLUTE 10. OUTSTANDING!
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,10,"I Honestly don't know how I only came across this movie this week.REALLY REALLY GOOD.
Certainly top 5 cartoon movie I watched, ever.GREAT WRITING.
OUTSTANDING NUANCED HUMOR AND CREATIVITY BEHIND EVERY DETAIL in the speech, script, personality.MY KIDS WATCHED IT 12 TIMES THIS WEEK. I watched 5."
" Good ingredients, average result
",2020-06-01 00:00:00,6,"I liked the main character, the conflict of the aliens moving everybody out to colonise Earth and the awkward alien Oh. However, overall I didn't feel like it amounted to much. There are a lot of funny moments but it wore thin."
" The cat fact
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,7,"Great kids movie but can be a biit more accurate. The cat named Pig, they said ""he"" throughout the entire movie which is inaccurate because Calico's are never boys. Look up the details why if you don't believe."
" Home
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,8,"But on the car ride home, when I asked about their favorite part, the best they could come up with was the cow joke (I won't repeat it).After all the great animated kid's movies of the last 10 years (Nemo, Shrek, Cars, Frozen, etc), this one is completely forgettable. In a month or two, my girls won't even remember it. Can't imagine they'll ever ask to get a DVD or watch it at home.I'm not sorry I took them, nor was it a waste of money. But we are so spoiled by such great animated movies that a mediocre one like this becomes disappointing."
" More fun than it deserved to be
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"Other than this film being a 90 minute commercial for Rihanna songs (seriously, every song in this film is sung by Rihanna. It wasn't enough that she voices one of the main characters?) I really enjoyed this film. It is one of the most original films Dreamworks has done. The trailers are false advertising. This is not E.T. It is completely different. I put this right up there with Turbo and Penguins of Madagascar. Dreamworks' films just keep getting better. 5 years ago it was Dreamworks putting out sequels every other year and Pixar doing original films. My, how the tables have turned. One day, Dreamworks may dethrone Pixar as the king of animated films. Why in the world did this only get 49% on Rotten Tomatoes? Further proof that most of the time it is inaccurate. This was originally supposed to come out in late November 2014, but due to production problems was delayed to late March 2015, and it shows, because there are Christmas decorations everywhere you look and Christmas plays a minor part in the story. Other than that, the film was excellent. The film was absolutely hilarious and had great writing. It most likely won't get nominated for Best Animated Film at the 2016 Oscars simply because it's Dreamworks, but it deserves to. Granted, this is the only animated film in 2015 right now, so my opinion my change once films like Inside Out, Peanuts, and Minions come out, but for now it deserves a nomination.
Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars"
" come on DreamWorks
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,2,When will DreamWorks catch up with Disney's animation quality. Nice story but the art department's quality aint enough
" a very cute animation
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,8,"A very cute animation. Engaging story, charismatic characters. Sad and happy moments"
" Great!
",2020-03-14 00:00:00,6,"Home is a great movie, I would watch it again, but there's just one problem.
It's too short, I wish it could go on forever-
Just kidding, but I'm more of a 2D animated person, I like 2D animated stuff, luckily they made Home: Adventures With Tip And Oh."
" Why?
",2019-12-01 00:00:00,1,"Why in the holly hell is this a movie?I get that dream works movies are supposed to have themes like medieval or viking or china,but aliens?Crap I call."
" Well..
",2019-11-23 00:00:00,10,"As an adult i found this movie super cute and it had a lot to teach younger children such as to face your mistakes, or not to avoid someone just because he might be a little different from you and much more other stuff. Reeeeealy liked it"
" Jim Parsons was great as the voice
",2019-11-12 00:00:00,7,"Of Oh. Oh is adorable and funny. I also liked Rihanna as Gratuity Tucci. And the car that Oh, and Gratuity rode in was good adorable. I was not sure I would like the movie when I started watching it. By the end of the movie I was glad I stuck the movie out to the end."
" Home
",2019-09-29 00:00:00,6,"I could do without the potty humor, and the story got really confusing, but it was charming enough and had a great soundtrack."
" This is the most annoying disappointing sci-fi Dreamworks film ever.
",2019-07-12 00:00:00,1,"I have seen this movie and I was very annoyed and disappointed in the film that I walked out of the theater halfway though the film.This movie is about the little alien monsters who takes over earth, their leader Captain Smek has been banished from his spaceship and meets a little teenage girl Tip Tucci. They build a flying hovercar and travel to places.First of all why is Tip an annoying bratty girl? I didn't like her, she whined and complained all the time and talked nonstop. Smek was always an annoying Alien who kept acting stupid.This movie has toilet jokes, What the heck were Dreamworks thinking? This is supposed to be a family movie, not a toilet humor movie. I finally walked out of the movie and I was very disappointed in this cartoon and it was a waste of my time.If I could change this movie, I would remake this movie and rewrite the script to have Tip be less annoying and be a nicer person. I would have Smek actually be a real funny alien. I'd get rid of the awful toilet humor jokes, I would have a better plot with more jokes that are funny. I did like the flying hovercar scene and the animated world but that was it.I would suggest better Dreamwork films, Kung Fu Panda, How to Train your Dragon, Shrek, over this super annoying movie. Or watch Meet the Robinsons instead, those movies are worth your time. Meantime I'll forget this annoying toilet humor lousy CGI movie."
" Why the heck did dreamworks make this.
",2019-06-20 00:00:00,1,"Oh my god, this movie is boring and to me is now the worst dreamworks, (worst than shark tale). The main character oh is annoying. Tip is boring and everything else is rubbish, the only thing that stands out is the animation, but apart from that it is not worth it."
" Kids love it
",2019-05-16 00:00:00,10,My kids love this movie. Good humor for kids and for adults.
" Loved It
",2019-05-13 00:00:00,10,"I love how this film starts with showing how the Boov keep running away from their enemies which I think sets the atmosphere for the movie really well. With only one of them seeming different and that being Oh I like how it shows how he is just wanting to be friends with people and makes mistakes like everyone however wants to fix them as much as he possibly can. With finding a human girl and learning from her about family and the need for friendship I thought it was really sweet and created an amazing bond between the alien and the human as well as making the audience want them to survive together. Not only this humour throughout this film helped to keep it nice and light which is perfect for children while also having a more emotional impact when the girl finally gets reunited with her mother after being away from her because of the aliens and thinking they will never see each other again. Not only that but by showing how far family will go to get back to each other and the love for each other helped Oh to discover why the aliens they were running away from was searching for them and it was because they had the young of that species in which the leader of the Boov had stolen from them which could have made their race extinct. The animation throughout was really well done as well and helped to create the atmosphere and make this movie a great experience in which I found it really easy to get lost in.Overall, this is a great animation movie in which I would recommend for the whole family as well as for those who are looking for a comedy movie. This is definitely a movie I will see again and I can't think of any faults with it."
" I just love this movie
",2019-04-21 00:00:00,10,"I love it! I think it's funny, sad and so sweet. I love Oh and how the story goes! Just love it!"
" Home Review
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,9,"When Istanbul architect Dogan falls ill, it gives him the chance to revisit his old stomping grounds in the Turkish countryside. Time, though, has cast an unexpected spell on his homeland.
Mentor Nuri Bilge Ceylan proves an inevitable influence on actor Muzaffer Özdemir's handsome, thoughtful debut, which uses an Istanbul architect's rustic sabbatical to consider the spoliation of the Turkish landscape and modern society.Nuri Bilge Ceyla's protégé Özdemir tries his hand behind the camera with solid results. A measured, painterly debut."
" Pig the cat
",2019-03-07 00:00:00,8,Cute movie but the cat is a female not a male. Calco are females not males. So when Tip says HIS name is Pig it should be HER name is Pig.
" SO INCREDIBLY SACCHARINE!
",2019-02-12 00:00:00,2,"There have been a lot of Dreamworks movies that have taken risks, and failed respectively, but what if I told you that there was a Dreamworks movie that took no risks? Like none! Honestly, it's such a safe happy meal of a movie that it would only be entertaining to kids under the age of 4, this is NOT a family friendly movie, it's a TODDLER safe film that anyone over the age of 4 will be smothered to death with indealic cotton candy play doh for 90 minutes, at no point in the movie will you feel tension, fear, or any emotion within you other than a: huh. There's no risk! No one ever feels in any sort of danger or anything! That sly mature dialogue that we've seen and heard in Dreamworks movies is just, GONE! I mean, I respect a movie that tries something new and fails a lot more then a movie that tries nothing at all. I cannot think of anything else there is literally no reason to see this movie."
" Fun but nothing more
",2019-01-09 00:00:00,6,"I watched the film without the original voices , so missed all the big stars. But the film was fun, emotional and totally worth watching on a rainy day"
" Just a Music Advert
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,3,"I feel for Jim Parsons. Such a talanted artist is wasted alongside a pop singer of this sort. Had I known this movie would be peppered with such a soundtrack, I'd have gone for a game of badminton instead. Now I completely understand it's a kids movie and while the morals and story are pretty good, there should be an advisory warning that this is basically an advert for Rhianna, not quite a movie as such.
There are a few funny moments but not enough to hold my full attention throughout. I felt myself drifting off only to be alerted back to the movie with another Rhinanna song. I just can't bear that type of modern pop music - it's just a reminder of how badly the world is doing right now.
Parsons is the saving grace with his likeable exciting voice and I'm sure he will bounce back from this one. As ever his lines are delivered impeccably and, to be fair, Rhianna does a good job too although she really should leave the soundtrack to proper music writers who know how to move you, film-wise.
Another way to describe; I watched Toy Story, Shrek, Aladdin, Sword in the Stone etc billions of years ago in a galaxy far far away and would watch them all again without hesitation. I would only watch Home again if peace on Earth depended on it."
" Jim Parson's the alien
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,10,Review: I loved this movie because it teaches us two things one friends can be anything and two home is most important. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Cute
",2018-09-26 00:00:00,6,Not the best but it was ok. I wasn't that into it. Rihanna did a good job as a voice actor though
" Subversive theme?
",2018-07-24 00:00:00,1,The premise of this movie smacked a little too much of Nazi invaders rounding up all the undesirables and putting them in a concentration camp.
" Fun loving movie to show what and where Home is
",2018-07-10 00:00:00,7,This is a movie that I still talk about and rave about almost 3 years after it's release. Home is a great way to teach young children that home is where your heart is. This can be used as a great tool especially for military children that have parents overseas.
" Don't listen to the other people
",2018-06-28 00:00:00,10,"I cried this movie near the end. I love this movie so much! It's a perfect family movie for everyone! (Not if U don't like childish things) But in all seriousness, this movie was sad, (Ish), Funny, And a perfect child movie! 10/10. Recommend you see this movie!"
" The Longest Rihanna Music Video I've Ever Seen
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,3,"There are five Rihanna songs in this movie. Why? Why would you do that at all, let alone when Rihanna is voicing the female lead? I just don't understand this movie."
" Good Movie
",2018-05-02 00:00:00,10,I love it. This movie is the best for me but in my first time that I see the picture's movie I think the cat will be main character in story.
" Its ok, I guess.
",2018-04-02 00:00:00,6,"A while ago I was browsing through Netflix and I found this movie. Though I was entertained, that doesn't mean that its very good. Plot - No logic is established in this movie. The plot is very contradictory and pretty much nothing makes any sense. I understand that this is a children's movie about an alien invasion, but its not too much to ask for a movie where there is a consistent cause and effect relationship between all the different events. Characters - The characters are contradictory and simplistic. Animation - The animation is simplistic, but visually colorful and kind of entertaining. Overall this movie is a bit dull. There aren't really any stakes to the nonsensical story. Its not that funny, and the stupidity is a bit of a turn off. I wouldn't recommend this movie, but it will entertain a very young child who doesn't have the ability to follow and understand complex ideas."
" Awesome movie
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,10,Values that are shown in the movie are awesome. Family and friendship and that we should make things right.
" Underrated
",2018-02-24 00:00:00,9,"I have absolutely NO idea why people were so disappointed with this movie. I've watched this movie a couple of times now, and all of the times I smiled a lot and cried when it got serious(which it did like 1 time). The music choice fits the movie, the lead role voices fits perfectly if you ask me, Jim Parsons voice makes this movie 10 times more fun. Why were people so disappointed? I'm actually really confused, because to me this movie was really cute and enjoyable. I really think people should give it a chance and that they're over exaggerating. C'mon, it's a movie for kids, chill out. I'm an adult and I can proudly say I enjoyed this movie. Stop expecting so much from kids movies. Would recommend, you'll definitely feel happier after watching this."
" Beter than expected!
",2017-08-24 00:00:00,9,"When the movie began, i thought the story wouldn't be so nice etc. But, wow the movie was really good and i just loved the English of Oh. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, so i'm not gonna say much. For me a movie gets a 10/10 when the movie gets me glued to the sit or makes me cry or laugh really hard. This movie made me cry in the end but i don't want to reveal why see it for yourself."
" A great movie that's giving you a special feeling
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,9,"When I started watching this movie, for the first few minutes I thought this was just going to be another modern 3D animation, falling into non- sophisticated family drama and dry but OK comedy, but Home truly amazed me.Because the way it makes you feel, is special and unique. The feeling started since the beginning of their advantage(Tip and OH) with soundtracks played in their bubble-flashy flying car, I noticed people blaming there were too many songs of Rihanna's, but I didn't notice and did not care.It's like swimming in a colorful pool and you can see rainbows while feeling potentially being suffocated but not really. The adventure was not intense at all, but with the special background music it makes me feel like the movie makers were intentionally making it this way and it's really special and unique, in a great way.The movie is not just for children, actually I tend to think there was something in Home that's only for adults to taste and understand, family, bravery, love...But beyond that, the loneliness of being an outcast in a social environment being eliminated by those who care about you, and henceforth the thing they give you which you would cherish forever----hope. And then, you get to feel the warmth, the ""temperature"", the HOME.Indeed, why isn't it called Planet Earth or A Friendship Between Me And A Poov? Because, there's something worthy of your thinking, and it's what's called home.The only drawback I think is the length of the movie is a little short, it feels like the makers were trying to condense it, so sometimes I feel the inconsistencies between several subsplots at the end, but the feeling did not fade away. Overall, I give it 9 out of 10."
" It was mehh
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,6,"The plot, animation,and connection between the characters were cute, but honestly, it wasn't Dreamworks's best work. The movie was decent,and I want to love it, but Rihanna's role pretty much ruined it for me. I felt like Tip's age and persona didn't match with the Rihanna's voice too well in my opinion, and her character in general seemed so basic. ""Oh"", the other protagonist, was adorable, and I think had more character development than Tip's, and he seemed much more interesting. The film wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either, they tried, you can tell, but they didn't pull it off all too well in my opinion, DreamWorks could've done better. However I do like their Netflix original series (same name), the humor is much more fluid, the characters are much more developed, and in each episode they have such an original plot, so at least they've had a positive outcome from the movie."
" ""Home"" not just for kids
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,7,"""Let's go see that new movie with the cute alien!"" my girlfriend said as I sighed internally. Animated films are typically not my cup of tea, and out of all the action-packed blockbusters out at the time like ""Kingsman"" and ""Furious 7,"" she had to choose the Sheldon Cooper alien flick. However, in every relationship it is important to strive to make the other person happy, so we went to see the cute alien movieand I was pleasantly surprised by DreamWorks' ""Home."" Jim Parsons stars as Oh, a whimsical, accident-prone alien part of the race known as the Boov. The movie opens with narration from Oh explaining whom the Boov are, how their society works and their current predicament. On the run from the menacing Gorg, the Boov discover and invade the Earth in a friendly fashion, deeming it a suitable place to seek refuge. After transferring the human population to a remote location on the planet, the Boov effortlessly occupy the cities of Earth and add a personal touch to the established human society.Shortly after their arrival, Oh decides to host a party for the other Boov in his apartment. When no one shows up, Oh tries to convince Kyle (Matt Jones), a Boov cop who Oh claims is his best friend, to come to the party. Rather than sending a single invite to Kyle however, he accidentally sends a mass invite to every species in the galaxy, including the Gorg. Already not being liked by his kind for his odd and eccentric nature, this mistake results in Oh becoming a fugitive. While all this is happening, a young human girl named Tip (Rihanna) is driving through the city with her cat Pig after being separated from her mother during the invasion. By chance, Tip and Pig cross paths with Oh as he is fleeing the Boov authorities. Tip has a burning hatred for the Boov because of the invasion, and this is exhibited in her encounter with Oh. However, after realizing that Oh can help reunite her with her mother, Tip reluctantly allows him to travel with her and Pig.The chemistry between Jim Parsons and Rihanna is the driving force behind the story. Oh is adorable. Parsons and the animators do a great job in conveying the positive attitude that characterizes Oh while also subtly showing the underlying sadness that he feels from being an outcast. The gradual shift in Tip's demeanor towards Oh and the friendship that develops between them is also fun to watch. Steve Martin, Jennifer Lopez and Matt Jones also do well in their supporting roles.While the plot is not quite as jumbled as expected, the writing is still the weakest aspect of the film. Oh's narration in the opening minutes throws the audience right into the world of the Boov and the Gorg in an approach that feels slightly rushed and forced. In addition to this, the Boov speak in a broken form of English not alluded to in Oh's monologue at the beginning, which made the first several minutes of the movie puzzling for me. Once you're settled into the film however, you will begin to smile, laugh and possibly cry at the comical, yet moving story unfolding on screen.I have never been a fan of the 3D gimmick. Today it is overused, not used to its full potential and expensive. However, the cinematography in this movie stood out to me particularly because of the way the 3D was utilized in the opening thirty minutes of the film. There is one shot in particular in which the camera weaves in and out of various rooms and a ventilation shaft in a house. This is neat to watch in and of itself, but the 3D feature makes the viewer actually feel like he or she is in the room, flying amidst the clutter and the small corridors in the ventilation shaft.Thanks to a star-studded cast, a fairly cohesive script and effective visuals, ""Home"" is a funny, warm and heart-felt film that will appeal to audiences of all ages. A couple of takeaway points from the experience: never judge a book by its cover, and guys don't be hesitant to let the lady choose the movie every once and a while, she just might surprise you."
" Much better than expected
",2017-03-23 00:00:00,8,"I was watching thinking of another generic average afternoon animation movie, which is good itself, but to my surprise it was an amazing film, the two main actors did a great job and the film was interesting all over for me.I had a great time"
" Just another generic kids movie.
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,4,"We have seen many movies in which kids have interact with extra terrestrials before. From E.T. to Lilo and Stitch, we have seen this been done before. ""Home"" is a movie that tries this formula, and fails. It wants to be a funny and smart animated movie and it turns out that the film is nether funny nor smart. It's the basic kids movie formula disguised as a DreamWorks movie and that boggles me. This was the studio that brought us great movies throughout the past decade, but sadly, this film surely ain't one of them.The film begins with a ""friendly invasion"" (as the movie puts it) of Earth by an alien species known as the Boov who are led by Captain Smek (Steve Martin). They have been chased from planet to planet by the Gorg, the Boov's enemy. The humans have been relocated so the Boov can move into their homes. One Boov named Oh (Jim Parsons) is trying to make friends with the Boov, but none of them seem to like him. He decides to throw a housewarming party and invites everybody he knows to his party, and I mean everyone. Everyone in the galaxy, including the Gorg. Oh is then a fugitive on the run, and later bumps into a fourteen year old girl named Gratuity Tucci who goes under the name Tip (Rihanna). She is the only one not to be abducted and relocated by the Boov and is searching for her mother who was abducted along with everyone else. So, the two of them go off on a journey to find Tip's mother and clear Oh's name.The film is based off the book ""The True Meaning of Smekday"" by Adam Rex and having not read the book, I don't know how much of the book was kept in the film or not, but that still doesn't excuse the film's poor story and characters. The story is about as cliché a kids movie you can get. It's not awful, but certainly not great. The characters are cut outs. We have seen all the characters before. The screw up that has a good heart, the girl who tries to be tough but has a soft side, the bully captain that has a giant ego. It's nothing new. The performances of the characters is what I'm split over the most about them. Jim Parsons' performance as Oh sometimes gets a laugh, but sometimes watching him I kept thinking of Sheldon from Big Bang Theory and wishing he would have funnier things to say. Tip is a really well written character. She is written like a proper fourteen year old girl, but Rihanna's performance is what sinks her chances of being a good character. Her performance as Tip is so bland and unemotional that I'm really surprised that she got cast in the role. The only character in my opinion that actually has something funny to say and has good delivery of the lines is Steve Martin as Smek. He steals every scene of the movie he was in and was actually pretty funny in his role, maybe because he was the only Boov that could talk normal. Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention. The Boov talk like that ""Can I has cheeseburger?"" meme throughout the whole movie and it gets really old fast. ""Home"" is a film that in my opinion is in the wrong studios hand. I kept thinking that this film should have been in another studios hands like Illumination or maybe even Disney. Maybe they could have made the film much funnier and smarter than what DreamWorks had turned out. I don't know and I guess I never will. I don't think it would be bad to show ""Home"" to kids, but personally, I would just show them Lilo and Stitch instead."
" For small children
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,4,"Home, go home.Home has good animation, quirky characters, a very interracial movie, an original story, some funny moments (very few), and Rihanna and Steve Martin are quite natural and credible in their respective roles. A priori, the story has a good message: it tries to see the good things in humanity, speaks of what being a friend and being family feels like, and how important is keeping your word. I really liked that the Boovs change colour depending on their mood.However, the characters are poorly developed, the story is not engaging enough for adults, too many clichéd twists and turns, and then there is the dubbing. I love Jim Parsons, but he is not good as Oh because, as soon as Oh opens his mouth, we hear Sheldom Cooper from The Big Bang Theory with all his quirks and voice inflections, not Oh, so that ruined the movie for me from the very beginning. This movie would have been great, it had good things a priori, but it ended being something all right.This is an example of how a big production company can spend millions on animation to make a feature film and get nothing that will make you have a great time unless you are a small child, nothing that will make you lol, nothing that will touch your heart, nothing that will stay in your head for too long, nothing that will make you include the film in your fave list of animated films, and nothing that most animation lovers will find good or will be willing to see for a second time, even for free. I personally struggled keeping my attention when I first watched it."
