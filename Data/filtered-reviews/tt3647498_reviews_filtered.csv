" Worth watching
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,7,I really enjoyed watching this. No preaching. Just entertainment.
" A boring story make no good movie
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,4,"The story starts with a gang killing gone wrong.
Now seeking shelter with her ex-con father a young prostitute (she is nothing more than a gang bride) she tries to flee. Of course her former gang members seek revenge. All end in an shoot out.Now this movie brings nothing new. The performance is sub par at it best and the end unrealistic...I mean a gang has a long (very long) memory and would seek the traitor for revenge."
" Excellent film...
",2021-02-23 00:00:00,8,"Filming, my God, Mel Gibson a respectable sixty, beautiful, talented, convincing, that daddy's wild charm, I loved it, the cute Erin Moriarty too, were born to be father and daughter, fofys... The teenage rebellion of lord-know- everything that always bothers me, shooting, blows and bombs that never hit the protagonist, ops, here we have this differential, excellent film, action and drama in the exact measure..."
" NOT BLOOD BROTHER, THANKFULLY
",2021-02-08 00:00:00,6,"Saga of Father-Daughter on the lam. sometimes annoyingly pedestrian and corny, but good enough overall to be worth a fun watch. Even achieves occasional father-daughter moments that ring true, rare in such an action cliche' relationship in such ridiculously over the top situations. Humor is hit and miss, but the hits made me lol"
" Awful movie with unusually high ratings.
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,2,"A waste of time. Bad direction, bad acting, unrealistic and absurd storyline. Think the only thing good in this movie are the few social commentary lines and that feels out of place in a movie like this. A stain on the careers of Mel, Macy and Luna."
" Perfect for Mel
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,7,"At a time in his career and life when playing a light-hearted funny guy (like in Lethal Weapon) is not really viable (or believable) this choice of playing a dark role in a dark film is quite apt.And, to his credit, he delivers. He may be not the most awesome human being but he can deliver a movie, either as an actor or a director.Blood Father is a really good movie with plenty of drama and intensity.If you love Mel, and a rating point if you hate him take one off!This movie stands up."
" ""Your hair came out good.""
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,7,"My first car was a 1969 Chevy Nova, so whenever I see one in a movie it grabs my attention. John Link's (Mel Gibson) had obviously seen better days, and didn't serve as a getaway car very long with the Sicarios showing up to haul it away. This is another actioner from the aging Gibson, and it's his penchant for these 'B' bordering high voltage dramas that seem to keep him going these days. If you consider the real life age difference between Link and his film daughter Erin Moriarty (64 vs 26), you might think she'd be better cast as the granddaughter, but then the story would have blurred the line of credibility even further. It's stretched as it is because her character is only seventeen in the story, already a victim of a drug cartel and on the way to being a full fledged junkie. When she accidentally shoots her boyfriend Jonah (Diego Luna), she seeks her estranged Dad's help in evading certain death at the hands of the gang that's been ripped off by her beau.I have to say, Jonah's recuperative powers were nothing short of miraculous, because after being shot in the neck, and by his own admission undergoing a series of underground doctors and blood transfusions, he came back pretty much good as new in what, about twenty four hours would you say? Okay, 2 days at the outside.Nothing much new to expect here. The action is not quite Mad Max caliber, and the story doesn't offer the twists of ""Get the Gringo"", but it's still Gibson giving it all in a final face off with the bad guys. And when it's all over and you had time to think about it, you'll wonder what ever became of the thirty grand reward being offered for Lydia Jane."
" Off duty Dad, back on duty
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,7,"Mel Gibson plays John Link, ex-con, ex-drunk and ex-drug addict, has narrowly forged a proper example for his estranged daughter Lydia (Erin Moriarty). Out of the blue, seventeen year old Lydia calls her dad after her boyfriend dumps her and sets her up for trouble with a Mexican drug cartel. Daddy finally gets to stay sober enough to stand rugged and tall to prove himself. This is a roll Gibson can sink his teeth into..Filling out the cast: Diego Luna, Daniel Monacada, William H. Macy, Michael Parks and Dale Dickey."
" Great acting, great story
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,8,"First of all you get Mel and Erin, you know it will be great. And they are on it in this one. Second, its a good story, no BS, well directed. Only 8 *s because its not groundbreaking... but its a good 90 minutes spent."
" Done a thousand times before
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,2,"This time a revenge movie where the acting is very poor, the movie starts with lots of visual noise, audio noise, and lots of action and aggression... Before I even know who is who and what their motivations are.Without this basic information an action scene or tension means nothing, because I don't know the stakes. It is amateur level work in the world of cinematic storytelling.The movie is plagued with bad actring and bad editing. This movies tries to be 'Taken' but without any of the buildup or pacing. The music is incredibly bad and grating.2/10 This is terrible and borderline unwatchable."
" Mad Mel 2.0 ... Bloody awesome!
",2020-10-08 00:00:00,7,"I have tremendous respect for experienced (and ""ageing"") actors who still evolve along with the times and the current cinematic industry standards. Guys like Sylvester Stallone, Liam Neeson and Mel Gibson have been starring in action movies for 3-4 decades already, but they are still as tough and fit as ever, and even take on roles that are far more violent and graphical than in the old days. Of course, Mel Gibson has always been a bit of an outcast, and the last years he even turned into persona-non-grata in Hollywood due to a handful scandals. But still, you got to love how Mel responds to his ""fallen star"" status; - by accepting roles that are excessively violent and self-parodying in depicting him as a terrible role model (""Machete Kills"", ""The Expendables 3"", ""Dragged Across Concrete"", ""Blood Father"")...""Blood Father"" has a very simple, yet effective plot. Ex-con father, trying desperately to stay off the alcohol and not to break his parole, must protect his estranged and rebellious teenage daughter from members of an unhinged Latino drug cartel, of whom she accidentally killed the leader/her boyfriend. This is more than a mindless ""shoot 'em up"" action vehicle, mind you, as the French-born director Jean-François Richet (""Public Enemy N°1"", ""Assault on Precinct 13"") puts a lot of effort into the redemption aspect. Gibson's character link goes very far to set straight his former mistakes and to safeguard his daughter. Don't worry, though, as there are many great bits of violence, including a nasty motorcycle chase and a handful of brutal close-range executions. Splendid to see cool actors like William H. Macy and Michael Parks in significant supportive roles and, personally, I really appreciated the dry sarcasm of certain sequences, notably when the 17-year-old girl can easily buy a lot of bullets but has to show her ID for cigarettes."
" one of the best
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,10,Each year 1/2 movies come out that are worth paying for. This is one.
" very boring I don't like it only good thing is Mel (5.4)
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,5,"To be honest, I watched for Mel Gibson, which was the only good side of the movie.
It's a very simple and classic subject, I couldn't see any difference even the movie bored me, it's not nice, it's ridiculous, the fast processing of the subject bothers me.Finally, I don't like the end"
" Great action film with a top action star!!!
",2020-09-05 00:00:00,9,This is a movie about a lead character who was carved out of American stone!! Back when there was no politically correct!! Driving an American made machine like a harley!!! This is a topnotch action thriller mel at his best!!!!
" Mel's ""Comeback"" ?
",2020-08-12 00:00:00,6,"""This film is well worth a watch, and I can't decide whether I should feel guilty or happy about this.""
Come on now, this is a ... MOVIE. Taking the ramifications of watching a ... ""MOVIE"", a bit too serious ?
It'd fairly entertaining as long as we stay mostly off the Girl's coming of age struggles. Mel is good, as he usually is. Good to see he is partially out of ""Movie Jail"" for his past indiscretions."
" Just okay, nothing special.
",2020-07-08 00:00:00,6,I'm not going to write this was a bad movie because it was somewhat entertaining but it wasn't a masterpiece either. I have nothing against Mel Gibson but I don't think he's an all round actor. He's good at action comedies but when it gets a bit more serious his flaws just show. That said he's still decent enough to not be annoyed by it. Blood Father must have it from its action scenes (there are plenty of those so it was okay) as the story is a bit déjà-vu. I don't regret watching it but it's just going to be a one time viewing for me.
" very underrated movie
",2020-07-03 00:00:00,10,This is such an underrated movie. I found it very entertaining and very moving but not contrived. I think its one of Mel's best movies. Not enough people have seen this gem. For an action movie it was very well acted (the action parts were just a plus) I felt the story to be believable and there is a lot of chemistry between the father and daughter. Worth a watch. In a weird way it reminds me of Gran torino (the bonding and the endings) Blood Father us a Fantastic film. Great cast. I saw it when it came out and enjoyed watching it yet again on netflix.
" Rough & Tough Father/Daughter Ride
",2020-07-01 00:00:00,6,"(Flash Review)This illustrates the importance of good parents. An ex-con's teenage daughter, presumed missing, returns home after she gets into a violent sticky situation with the people she was rolling with. After she flees, some of those people begin to track her down yet they don't know her father is.....Mel Gibson. Ha. Let the rugged cat and mouse chase begin. Beyond the tough violence, this is also a story of it is never too late to make amends. Gibson's father character wasn't involved with his daughters life yet gets a chance to put his love and relationship to an extreme test. This is a decent little rough and tough action film with a father/daughter core tale."
" watch only to sleep on it
",2020-06-29 00:00:00,3,"One of the worst plot/scinario/twists/acting i have ever seenThe girl did one of the worst acting jobs ive ever seen , partly wasnt her fault but the horrible script's fault ."
" Awesome
",2020-06-18 00:00:00,8,I like Mel Gibson and he never disappoints when he is in a film. Erin Moriarty is a so cute in this one and shows she is also a skilled actor. I think most will like the story and appreciate the effort
" A Fun-Filled Live-Actor Cartoon
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,8,"Don't expect Shakespeare. --- 1. This movie is simply a cartoon with live-actors. The movie is simply good-natured, root for the good-guy fun. It is excellent if one likes movies where, with appropriate pathos, good trumps & beats evil.
--- 2. In the action scenes, the good-guys defend themselves from the despicable bad-guys, & in the process, the bad-guys receive their richly deserved, grisly, & ketchup-splattered justice.
--- 3. The movie is not at all high-brow. One moves from one semi-expected scene to the next semi-expected scene. The good-guys, Mel Gibson & his estranged daughter Lydia (Erin Moriarity), move between appreciation, explanation, irritation, & eventually to heart-felt love.
--- 4. The movie fairly well explores a father's love for his daughter. In real life, this is truly one most beautiful emotions in human existence.
--- 5. With this movie, just have fun. The 1:30 that one spends on this movie will be well spent, Enjoy."
" Solid plot, disjointed dialogue
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,5,"Maybe it's just me on this one, but the dialogue and storyline often felt disjointed and had no flow. The plot itself was pretty solid, and enjoyable to watch, the acting pretty good. Mel Gibson was giving off some lethal weapon vibes which I enjoyed, it's a good character for him."
" Gibson is Still Great
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,8,"A violent, moving, redemptive tale, Blood Father is a visceral action thriller with a familiar plot, but it had good performances, and I liked it.Mel Gibson is as crazy as ever, with lots of great dialogue and insults, as well as probably the most f-bombs he's probably ever uttered in a movie. He still has the charisma and physicality for action movies, as many of these older stars seem to, and he's complimented by a strangely solid and not annoying performance from Erin Moriarty, who manages to actually not be a horribly underdeveloped, one-dimensional daughter character that's only there to get saved, although that does happen a lot. She's better than the daughter in Taken or Erased. William H. Macy is also good in a supporting role, and he does well with what little he has to work with.The movie isn't action-heavy, and is just as much a drama as an action film. There is a fair amount of gritty, bloody action though. The trailer attack was cool, the motel scene was intense, and the motorcycle chase was pretty cool with a great bad guy death. The climax in the desert is the highlight. A motorcycle explodes and kills two dudes, and Mel kicks the crap out of two guys in a car with his hands duct taped. Mel Gibson still goes all-in for the action scenes, which is cool to see.There's enough blood and violence, but amid all the savagery it manages to be a redemptive, almost uplifting film, and not at all the nihilistic bloodbath that the premise may suggest. I can unashamedly recommend this film. It's another solid effort from Mel Gibson."
" Why
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,5,"This is that movie that I'm sure Mel Gibson would like to undo :))
Why the hell did you do this?
I have a theory, and that's they punished you for speaking against those with power in Hollywood. So they gave this role for those 2 scenes where you can do the ""nazis bad"" repentance"
" Decent watch
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,6,"I enjoyed the movie. Some parts had me thinking you've got to be kidding me, WHY?!! But an overall decent watch."
" Awful
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,3,Blood daddy is just below average action movie which I'll probably forget in a day or two. Gibson's personal speech about alcoholism is the only believable moment in the film.
" Role Reversal for Mel
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,8,"This movie reminds me of Bird on a Wire with Mel and Goldie Hawn. the motorcycle, being chased, and quite a few semi-recreations...just a bit more serious.just a bit slow in places, but still enjoyable"
" GENRE EXCELLENCE
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,8,"The knocks on this film have nothing to do with story, acting, direction, cutting, etc...Perhaps a better score, a slightly bolder, fresher script, a couple other things...But if you want a couple hours to eat too much popcorn, this film will grab you, keep you in your seat. Good pace and rhythm, Mel is terrific, Erin Moriarty is excellent and gives this character real depth, wonderful appearance by the always great Michael Parks, and the supporting characters do their jobs well.I had other stuff to do, but couldn't pry myself away until end credits, which I cut short. I'll look them up online when I have more time..."
" Mean and exciting
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,9,"I was never a huge fan of Mel Gibson but I did like a lot of his movies. But after watching ""Blood Father"", I may have to rewatch his older films. Gibson gives an excellent performance in this movie. He's older, grizzled, meaner and I couldn't take my eyes off him. As good as Gibson is, his supporting cast is right there with him. ""Blood Father"" has a good story and is filled with great characters. The action is well staged. This movie is also very good looking. The location photography is top-notch. I really enjoyed ""Blood Father"" and I'll be watching it again pretty soon."
" Barbaric!
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,10,"Fast moving and violent film about a father's efforts to save his daughter who willfully hooked up with a drug dealing boyfriend and is now in jeopardy for her life from a Mexican cartel. And wow, did Mel Gibson put on some serious muscle. That dude is buffed out. I think he can take Stallone."
" These reviews are lying lol
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,3,"This movie seemed like a parody it was so bad.
I found myself laughing at super ""serious"" parts.
Characters lack development.
Storyline is so flawed.
Mel Gibson has a nice beard."
" Not Bad for Nextflix
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,6,"This was actually better than I expected. It was a different role for M. Gibson. This is an ok movie movie to watch while practicing ""social distance"" and staying home for a movie night."
" Tired like Gibson's career
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,3,"Hey I loved Mel back in the day, but that day is further and further in the rear view. It does look good so if you dont pay much attention it looks the role, but unfortunately it doesnt withstand any scrutiny. Mel looks bored as can be spouting off weak one liner after weak one liner, the action is cartoonish at times, tired at others, dialogue terrible, and overall execution is bad. The final act is easily the best, but that didn't come close to saving this snooze fest. I firmly believe the director had no idea where to go with this so tried to go with some bizarre blend of father-daughter, tough ex-con, coming of age story.Right from the start it just doesnt play well with Moriarity looking like a valley girl hanging with some hard core gang bangers. Gibson is supposed to be the hardened criminal, but talks like a wise cracking college professor half the time and Mel Gibson playing a criminal the other half. Which makes sense because mid-stream he drops the hardened con looks for the traditional Mel Gibson look. The roles of rebellious daughter and recovering alcoholic ex-con father have been done before, and better, half a dozen times.The first ""hit"" is so comically bad I cant do justice describing it. Suffice it to say it would look completely at home in a Three Stooges episode. From there M&M frolic their way through situations that are supposed to be scary and suspenseful, but only serve to be vehicles for Mel's flat one liners.Props to the hotel clerk for providing the best acting in the movie in the one role that felt realistic, a young guy hitting on Mel's hot daughter. The rest felt like it looked, contrived and convoluted."
" Good action movie
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,8,"A rarity these days; something good on Netflix. I would swear that the girl playing Mel's daughter is Selena Gomez! It's not, but she could pass for her twin in this movie.
All in all, a good choice on a rainy Sunday afternoon."
" I WOULD'VE DIRECTED THIS DIFFERENTLY
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,8,"I could tell the screenplay was very well done. And although this is a good film and I enjoyed it, I would've directed this differently. I like Mel Gibson and Erin Moriarty, their performances were great but I would have chosen less of a mainstream cast and added more of a darker tone to this film."
" The daughter did not deserve saving
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,3,"What a waste of a decent premise. Hint to Hollywood. If you are going to make a film about a parent trying to save a daughter, at least make her a decent human being. I spent the whole movie wishing that she would be killed."
" One Of Mel Gibson's Best Shoot-Em-Up Kill-Em-All Movies
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,10,"03/26/2020 Definitely an enjoyable must watch thriller action movie. Great writing, great acting, excellent directing = We Win!!! This is what movie entertainment is all about. Bon Appetit'"
" The film would be better with happy ending
",2020-02-22 00:00:00,5,"The story was quite interesting, but nothing new or extraordinary.
The plot was not boring, mostly exciting. But I would have liked more action scenes. Overall, I can't give more than 5/10 because the happy ending was missing."
" Welcome back Mel
",2019-11-25 00:00:00,7,"A decent enough action movie with good pacing and a somewhat heartwarming father-daughter dynamic. Mel Gibson is perfectly suited to these such roles and he was right in his element here. You could call it a return to form.The film itself was mostly by-the-numbers with nothing really to set it apart from its contemporaries. Some good action scenes scattered throughout, but it was over all-too soon. William H Macy was majorly under utilised and everything became a bit too predictable.Still, it was enjoyable and gave me the action fix I was craving. Some oddly inspiring and motivational lines at times too. Recommend to fans of Mel Gibson or those wanting a quick action fix."
" A Fathers Love for his Daughter
",2019-09-28 00:00:00,7,"This movie is a testament to a fathers love for his daughter. Link barely knew his daughter, didn't agree with her choices, but he is still willing put his life on the line to protect her. Mel Gibson was the perfect choice for this role, a broken, flawed man trying to right his wrongs in real life, and he was able to fully realize this for his role as Link. If you want an enjoyable flick, keep this one on your list because it was well worth the watch. And welcome back, Mel!"
" Blood father review
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,6,"I think Mel Gibson is an amazing actor because he can play different roles. In Ransom he is the complete opposite that he is in Blood father. This film was made for him. The supporting cast, such as William H Macy and Erin Moriarty. The problem with the film is that the villains don't have a lot of screen time."
" Stop black listing Mel.
",2019-09-21 00:00:00,8,"He may be an awful person but his movies are exceptional.
More please."
" A responsible father act
",2019-09-08 00:00:00,7,"As usual - Mel has done an amazing job when he wants to deliver the real personality of the role ... He did exactly what a responsible and lover father would do ... This movie didn't show that Mel is an Iron man who never dies, or who has the ability to go into the CIA office and get what ever he wants after killing all the security - No, he was super real and that was the reason whom attracted me to pay attention when I am watching ... I hope that this star keep doing these lovely work ..."
" Mel Is Always Good
",2019-08-20 00:00:00,8,"I liked this film. We have a slrw of French directors ahain making American style films. Mel Gibson, William Macy and Diego Luna are terrific. It's too bad Raoul Trujillo is the sicario, for he has no lines, and is a terrific actor himself. He was in the stunning film ""Apocalypto"", which Mel Gibson directed. Erin Moriarty is quite good for her first breakout role. The supporting cast is very good also: Michael Parks, Dale Dickey and Richard Cabral are all well tasked, and prove it with their performances. The only part I didn't buy was Erin (""Lydia"") at an AA meeting in the final scene. Having been to well over 15,000 meetings, her little ""share"" did not ring true for me. However, I can overlook this as she is a very young actress."
" Gibson goes all Mike Tyson on em!
",2019-08-14 00:00:00,7,"Blood Father has a simple premise that's been done many times over, though a quality film regardless.Mel Gibson isn't back, because he never left. He's a great actor and always will be. Solid cast and performances all round. Its got personality, heart and enjoyable action sequences."
" Mad Max saving his daguther from drug dealer !
",2019-08-07 00:00:00,8,"It is a good thriller. Start to end you feel tension. Mel Gibson is protecting his daughter from nasty drug dealer is the main theme of the movie. Story is full of thrill and tension. Mel Gibson looks like in his old Mad Max avatar in last part of the movie. Both Gibson (Link, Father) and Erin Moriarty (Lydia, daughter) are well acted and seems that Erin have a good talent where as Diego Luna is perfect in drugged dangerous goon. Gibson is looking more dashing in his grey days than older Mad Max. Not a single moment boring you feel in whole movie. Must watchable for thriller lovers. As me there is a little possibility of sequel. Watch out."
" Well made POS!
",2019-07-30 00:00:00,5,"I don't watch horror but do watch well made action. John Wick's cool, This
makes me feel sad and unclean.. Watched it streaming on a barfly recc. Earns a a 5 for direction style but script, production and humanity it gets a 1. This is not a relatable, recognizable world. Sadistic POS. IMHO."
" my notes
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,6,Good movie with good characters. you really care about them and their relationship so you are constantly rooting for them and nervous when they are in peril. mel gibson did a great job (1 viewing)
" Someone please save Mel
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,1,Gibson needs a Quintan Tarantino to pull him back from obscurity. Horrific script . Cliche marathon.
" A good movie, typical Mel and great to see
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,8,"So nice to see Mel on the screen, it's a good Mel movie what more can I say"
" Mel Gibson at his best
",2019-06-01 00:00:00,8,"Mel Gibson to me has always been an exceptional actor. Lethal Weapon, Braveheart, Blood Father and everything in between.
His believable portrayal of every character he has played has been epic.
This movie I feel was exceptional. He played his role awesomely. Anyone who can relate to any part of the character he played, should agree. Really enjoyed this movie."
" Awful
",2019-05-29 00:00:00,1,Can't believe someone sat down and wrote this. Or sat down writing it thinking someone would buy it much less have Mel Gibson star in it. What kind of a world do we live in where this actually happens? But then I Googled the writer and saw who he was connected to and then it all made sense.Predictable. Old hat. Uninspiring. Stopped watching halfway through. Can only assume Gibson was under obligation to do this for whatever reason. Perhaps a studio head's idea of a joke?
" Mels much deserved return.
",2019-05-24 00:00:00,8,"This is top form Mel Gibson. A badass, gritty action flick where we see a ton of bloodshed by the end of his gun, following long scenes from a motorcycle. It's all a fairly sweet father and daughter story, a rather dark story of violence and crime and drugs. There are even bits and pieces in here of dark comedy. This all comes from Mel, who brings tons of charisma and rage and pure badassery. Overall, a highly satisfying film, from different angles of tragedy and remorse."
" Taken meets No Country For Old Men
",2019-04-21 00:00:00,9,"Do not believe the poor reviews; I almost didn't watch this and would have regretted it. I believe this is one of Mel's better roles. The film has enough twists and turns and it has a good pace. I love that it is shorter, they didn't drag it out like so many films with lulls and needless romance. Much better film than either of the two titles above. I'm glad Mel is still making movies."
" As good as Gibson used to be.
",2019-04-04 00:00:00,8,This film is very under rated. Was brilliant from start to finish very well acted back to the good old 90s Mel Gibson movies.
" Blood Father Review
",2019-03-23 00:00:00,8,"Recovering alcoholic ex-con John Link (Mel Gibson) is scraping out a living as a trailer park tattoo artist clinging to the hope of reuniting with his estranged, wayward daughter. But when the young woman (Erin Moriarty) suddenly shows up in serious danger, Link will have to draw on his criminal past if they're to survive.
Since his drunken 2010 outbursts and other revelations landed him in career jail, Mel Gibson's mostly just kept his head down, done his time and, more recently, tried to dip his toe back into working both behind and in front of the camera, with varying results. It's tempting to think he took the lead in Jean-François Richet's pulpy, throwback action thriller because it offers a much bloodier, vengeful metaphor for his story, but it's more likely he was attracted to the role of John Link because it let him channel the sort of characters he used to play so well. Link could very easily be an aged Martin Riggs, albeit one with an even darker past and less inclination to stay on the right side of the law.If you miss what Mel Gibson used to be, you'll find an acceptable, if slightly careworn version here.
The film, written by Peter Craig (the story comes from his 2006 novel) and Andrea Berloff (World Trade Center, Straight Outta Compton), at times feels like just another variant on the particular action genre that was re-established by Taken in 2008 - we have yet another father forced to rely on his particular set of skills to save his daughter from a nightmare scenario. There are the obligatory desperate phone calls shot through with promises of violence, the typical gang of enforcers sent to shoot, punch or kidnap the right target, and the times when our main man lets the muzzle of a pistol do the talking for him.

Link could very easily be an aged Martin Riggs, albeit one with an even darker past and less inclination to stay on the right side of the law.If you miss what Mel Gibson used to be, you'll find an acceptable, if slightly careworn version here.
The film, written by Peter Craig (the story comes from his 2006 novel) and Andrea Berloff (World Trade Center, Straight Outta Compton), at times feels like just another variant on the particular action genre that was re-established by Taken in 2008 - we have yet another father forced to rely on his particular set of skills to save his daughter from a nightmare scenario. There are the obligatory desperate phone calls shot through with promises of violence, the typical gang of enforcers sent to shoot, punch or kidnap the right target, and the times when our main man lets the muzzle of a pistol do the talking for him.
Fortunately, he's also stacked the cast with reliable performers, including William H. Macy as Link's pal and sponsor, Kirby, Miguel Sandoval as unforgiving crime boss Arturo, and Michael Parks, all gruff charm as our hero's old biker leader, Preacher, a man with a hoard of weapons you just know will come in handy. Still, it's Gibson's film through and through, and if you miss what he used to be, you'll find an acceptable, if slightly careworn version here."
" Blood Father Review
",2019-03-23 00:00:00,10,"Recovering alcoholic ex-con John Link (Mel Gibson) is scraping out a living as a trailer park tattoo artist clinging to the hope of reuniting with his estranged, wayward daughter. But when the young woman (Erin Moriarty) suddenly shows up in serious danger, Link will have to draw on his criminal past if they're to survive.
Since his drunken 2010 outbursts and other revelations landed him in career jail, Mel Gibson's mostly just kept his head down, done his time and, more recently, tried to dip his toe back into working both behind and in front of the camera, with varying results.

The film, written by Peter Craig (the story comes from his 2006 novel) and Andrea Berloff (World Trade Center, Straight Outta Compton), at times feels like just another variant on the particular action genre that was re-established by Taken in 2008 - we have yet another father forced to rely on his particular set of skills to save his daughter from a nightmare scenario. There are the obligatory desperate phone calls shot through with promises of violence, the typical gang of enforcers sent to shoot, punch or kidnap the right target, and the times when our main man lets the muzzle of a pistol do the talking for him.
In this case, the familiar situation is let a little further off the leash, powered by Gibson's growly, wrinkly, bearded tough nut, one with very little patience for people who try to kill him. It's an ideal role for the actor, and he's well balanced by Moriarty's occasionally sulky, but usually spirited Lydia, who is looking for her own measure of redemption even as she's not quite sure how to achieve it. Their fractured relationship is given room to breathe with several heart-to-heart conversations that mean it's not wall-to-wall action.
However, that side of the movie doesn't always entirely work; several moments of daddy-daughter bonding come across as overly melodramatic, movie-of-the-week-style scenes, while the grit and grime feels awfully routine as clashes happen in dusty, out-of-the-way places that mean there's little law enforcement around to stop the bullets flying. And Richet favours a jittery camera style that is distracting in some of the set-pieces.
Fortunately, he's also stacked the cast with reliable performers, including William H. Macy as Link's pal and sponsor, Kirby, Miguel Sandoval as unforgiving crime boss Arturo, and Michael Parks, all gruff charm as our hero's old biker leader, Preacher, a man with a hoard of weapons you just know will come in handy.

" CHEER! - (7 stars out of 10)
",2019-03-14 00:00:00,7,"The stage curtains open ...""Blood Father"" is gritty and raw ... and with a brutal honesty that is hard to ignore. Mel Gibson is well cast as John Link, an ex-con who is eeking out a living as a tattoo artist in the middle of nowhere. He is also an alcoholic who has been sober for two years and attends an AA group regularly to help him maintain a balance in his life.The movie starts out with his runaway daughter, who has been listed as a missing teen, mixing with the wrong crowd and getting into a deep mess when she shoots her boyfriend - who is more than he is letting on. Running for her life, she calls her Dad, John, for help and he picks her up and brings her back to his place. It isn't long before they find her, and John is forced to defend his daughter. To save her life, they hit the road and they endure obstacles along the way, while getting to know each other - which eventually leads to a final, bloody confrontation that will end things, one way or another.I was surprised by how much I liked this movie. Mel Gibson showed his acting chops here and proves he still has what it takes to carry an action/crime film. Even though Erin Moriarty is solid in her role as his lost daughter, it is really Gibson who carries this film. I was thinking to myself if anyone else had played this role, it might have been an ""okay"" film. It was Mel Gibson and his chemistry with Erin that makes this film ""good"".I recommend this movie. It has strong characters, people you care about, who are in a very realistic type of a situation. Well acted, good direction, good script and good cinematography. It is gritty, dirty and raw - not your polished ""Transporter"" type of film ... it brings out the animal in you. The one that will do whatever it takes to survive when pushed into a corner."
" One Of Mel's Better Movies - Enjoyable
",2019-02-24 00:00:00,8,02/25/2019 A fast paced movie from beginning to end. Lots-O-Shoot-Em-Ups. Viewer immersion into the storyline guaranteed due to exceptional acting (all except Macy) and a great director. Bon Appetit
" Half decent. At best.
",2019-01-23 00:00:00,5,"Good enough for a boring day, but that is. The story isnt that interesting, the action about par. As with many movies and series that lack real quality it tries to add 'action' and tries to make you feel you are part of the story by not using steadycams. I totally hate that. Its cheap, its annoying, its tiring."
" Gibson is still a Lethal Weapon on Screen...
",2019-01-09 00:00:00,7,"Ever since I was introduced to Riggs from Lethal Weapon I've always enjoyed seeing Mel Gibson on the big screen.Blood Father is a story about Link (Mel Gibson). Link is a ex-con who is finally living a clean life after having done hard time in prison. He is also proud to be Alcohol free, visiting local support groups and earns a honest pay as a tattoo artist while living in his trailer.Link also has a daughter who disappeared on him while he was locked up in prison and is now deemed a missing girl. Link even has wanted posters put up in hopes that one day he may discover the truth about his missing daughter.As it turns out Link's daughter, Lydia, is alive, but has dealings with drug dealers... until she is challenged to do something she finds uncomfortable. She manages to escape and desperately seeks help from the one man she can count on- her father.Blood Father is dirty, violent, suspenseful, and, my personal favourite thing in a movie- gritty. This film could be described as having the same atmosphere as a ""Grindhouse"" type of film. While the film does have a short duration I love the fact that this film goes straight to the point with a short introduction to lead characters. The story begins with some surprising action scenes which includes a mixture of gunfire, car crashes and even a bit of fun with motorbikes.Mel Gibson is back better than ever. I loved watching his character fight within himself to try and do what's right, but also do anything to protect his little girl (as any father does). Gibson's character also has a dark past which is revealed at key moments. At selected time I laughed when we got to see some the crazy (and sometime cheeky) side of him his character. Tense moments throughout the film are acted very well.Blood Father, overall, comes recommended. I will provide a word of warning for those that get tired of foul language because there is a serious amount to find here. The actress who plays Link's daughter I found slightly annoying at selected moments. Regardless of your personal thoughts of the lead actor personally, there is an outstanding performance to be seen and it was refreshing to see.7.6/10

" Short & Tight
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,8,"Mel Gibson has a presence like almost no one else. He is almost as good (although on the other side of the law) in this as he was in ""Edge Of Darkness"" (2010). Both films are well directed, written, taught & compelling. Erin Moriarty is very good for her age, & I have liked Diego Luna for years now, in spite of his youth. He rarely plays the antagonist (as he does here). A really good, fast paced & captivating film."
" Wow !
",2018-12-12 00:00:00,7,Its refreshing to see Mel Gibson still making movies. Great story great action great movie!
" One of Mel Gibsons best
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,8,"I am not into writing reviews, however after watching this movie I had too. This movie was great, packed with action. It has motorcycle gangs the cartel and more. What more could you ask for. Just shows what some fathers are willing to do to protect their baby girl. This is a must watch film and as I have stated it is one of Mel Gibson's best films."
" Entertaining movie
",2018-10-28 00:00:00,8,"Mel plays Link, an ex-con on rehab living in a run-down trailer community out in the desert. He does tattoos in his trailer and his sponsor lives nearby. His daughter Lydia has been missing for years. We actually meet Lydia in the intro, she's hanging out with gang-bangers, her boyfriend seems to run things, at some point forces her to shoot some lady but instead shoots him so is in the run now and decides to call dad. He picks her up in the city takes her back to the desert finds the gun, drugs. Of course the daughter doesn't come entirely clean as she should, but Link knows the world of crime.It's not long before the gang-bangers show up, shoot up and destroy his trailer before Link's neighbors show up. Link and Lydia have to make a run for it before police arrive, end up in a motel but police isn't far behind. As well as the evil sicario. This leads Link to wonder why all the firepower to get his daughter. They escape to his former racist biker-gang. But the leader isn't interesting in helping Link or in returning his bike and money, he's after the reward to for the girl. So Link has to confront his old pals and they escape on the bike.While Link goes to investigate what's up with Lydia's ex-boyfriend she gets a call from the sponsor and decides to follow his advice and go out. She's quickly grabbed by the bad guys. But Link now has a weapon too, he knows who the bad guys is and what he's done.That leads to the final confrontation out in the desert.Blood Father is a fun, fast-paced action flick. Mel is always likeable and Erin Moriarty is indeed a beauty and a revelation. The script deals frontally with race and racism but it's not all that embarrassing. Link's world is very different from Lydia's liberal Angeleno upbringing so they can't really understand each other's world view but instead of being judgemental and irrational decide to be...tolerant and accepting. After all they have more important things to worry about. It also portrays the relationship between the estranged father and daughter in a reasonable light, not common in Hollywood movie."
" Not well constructed, but a defining film for Mel Gibson
",2018-10-27 00:00:00,6,"He was famous, then he was loved, then he was hated, then he was boycotted. You know him as Mad Max or Martin Riggs. In this film, Mel Gibson is rough, angry, making fun of his own biases, trying to stay afloat as his daughter comes back into his life bringing chaos and destruction, but also a chance of redemption. Some people complained this film was too fast, I say it was too slow. At normal speed it is a movie made for the audience's speed, at 1.5 it's how Mel Gibson should act, with lightning bouts of emotion getting through the cracks. I loved the conflict he portrayed between the man who is trying to keep his life normal and together and the underlying creature filled with rage that he can barely keep under control.The story is nothing original, the script and actors are banal, all except Mel Gibson, who seemingly, at least for me, was playing himself. I would say that's the best and only reason to watch this film."
" Very good movie
",2018-10-18 00:00:00,8,"Great movie with a good message. And Gibson is awesome, steels every scene.This is really low rating, don't pay attention to it, had a great time watching it 8/10."
" Top!!! Adoramos...

" Something to say about modern day America.
",2018-08-22 00:00:00,7,"This film is about an ex-con reunited with his estranged wayward 17-year old daughter, and how he has to protect her from drug dealers who are trying to kill her. I didn´t expect to like this film. Although I am a Mel Gibson fan I thought it was going to be another action movie with too much blood and not enough substance. However, I found this film had some genuinly good dialogue and something to say about modern day America. One of the first things you see is his 17 y/o daughter buying a hand gun and a pack of cigaretts from a local store. The cashier lets her buy a dangerous weapon but asks her for ID for the pack of cigeretts. The irony is that both can kill you but only one will immediately blow someones head off.There is also a rather interesting conversation later in the film about illegal immigration and whether or not they are actually taking Americans jobs. Yet again, immigrants fill an important and specific demographic that the average American doesn´t want to fill. The Mexicans come across the boarder and do all the cleaning and low paid jobs that the Americans do not want. If the Mexicans were not there the USA would have to import foreigners to do these jobs anyway.It also has something to say about the lost people in America, and social intergration as well.This film has a genuinly sad ending which grounds the entire film and makes it more gritier and believable than most similar films."
" Surprisingly Good
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,8,"I had not seen Mel in anything since he had the bad breakup publicity with a former girlfriend and I thought maybe we'd never see him again. I had to google his name and go to his IMDb page to even know this movie existed it received such little publicity. There it got such an unpopular rating score I truly thought it would be horrible but I'm such a fan of his old movies and knowing how anyone in Hollywood with the courage to show their conservative tendencies can find themselves black-balled I had to see for myself. 
 I was very entertained and surprised to find a film that measures up with the majority of his good guy vs evil guys films. One of the refreshing things about movies made like this when an undisputed top billed actor has to go out of his way to find projects is we get to see lots of new faces of actors we've never seen before. I found the drug gang actors very convincing in emaciated appearance and attitude. I thought the actor that portrayed Mel's daughter a perfect casting. She should have a great career as a character actress. 
Anyone coming here to find some high-brow film should have known better by the title and synopsis so don't let the (obviously British) Liam Neeson and their 1/10 to 3/10 rating throw you off. If you are coming to be entertained by violence and action this fits the bill"
" Mel Gibson is the R-rated man!!
",2018-07-12 00:00:00,9,"He is more bad ass than ever. And funny too.Gibson plays an ex convict and an ex alcoholic, living in a trailer park, making a living as a tattoo artist. His best friend and sponsor is played by the equally great William H. Macy. Unfortunately he is not in the movie much. Gibsons daughter calls him. She's in trouble after killing her boyfriend who is a mexican criminal. Their gang keeps texting her, telling her that she's history. Soon Gibson and his daughter are on the run. I wont give away anymore of the plot. Its very violent and it reminds me of Taken (also directed by a frenchman) but this is better, more violent and funny too. Only letdown is Macy not being in the movie more. And with a running time of just 87 minutes, it feels like it should have been just 20 minutes longer. Because the showdown at the end is just over too fast. But maybe that was a budget problem, who knows. Thats why I'm only giving this movie 9 out of 10 stars. It shouldnt surprise me anymore that some of the best actionmovies in Hollywood are directed by frenchmen. Even though all french people Ive ever met are assholes, they sure know how to make actionmovies that the american directors no longer know how to make."
" Great entertainment!
",2018-05-29 00:00:00,9,"The right mix of action, humor, and what's most important in life - unconditional love."
" Mel is Back
",2018-05-07 00:00:00,6,"Most viewers will be pleasantly surprised with the plot and character ark of this film. It has a good pace and really does not drop off anywhere throughout the film. If your a fan of Mel Gibson (or even if your not), he is true to form like in Lethal Weapon or Ransom. He looks to be in amazing shape and his character comes across gritty, worn, and heart broke. Like a soul wandering through the world looking for meaning. His daughter is played by Erin Moriarty who showcases great range and emotion through the story. truly great performances on both ends. There is action/drama/and some raw humor. What the lengths a father will go to protect his daughter is defined here."
" Mel Gibson like I've never seen him before
",2018-04-25 00:00:00,8,"As said in the title, him playing a role of a ruined, rundown father was a new experience for me. He's not a shining hero, no one-man-army and he's far from perfect. As a former biker with a messed up past he tries his best to stay out of trouble and get back control over his life.Until one day his long-lost daughter comes back to ask for his help. With few connections from the past and very limited resources you see an aged man fighting to the limit to protect what's most precious to him.
The movie feels real and genuine. It's not afraid of showing people with dark sides, issues and struggles. They all try their best (or worst) to make a living and survive, driven by different motives.Apart from your typical hollywood plot you see that life is no fairy tale, it's a fight for every day, where nothing is to be taken for granted and we have to cherish what we have and every moment. A strong performance that left a strong impression."
" Surprisingly effective late career Mel Gibson movie
",2018-04-19 00:00:00,7,"I checked this movie out with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Mel Gibson gives an effective, emotional performance that pokes fun at some of his own problems with alcohol and accusations of racism. Would have liked to see William H Macy get some more screen time, but he makes the most of what is basically a cameo. I was also impressed with Erin Moriarty (who plays Mel's daughter). A very good actioner about a man trying to find redemption for his past sins and forgiveness for the kid that suffered for his criminal ways. Good to see Jean-Francois Richet return to directing English language films after a good start with the remake of Assault on Precinct 13."
" Blood Father is a Bloody Mess
",2018-03-20 00:00:00,4,"You want nasty, brutish, foulmouthed, low-life mindlessness? Then Blood Father could just give it to you. But, you may also need to be somewhat of a mindless thug yourself to get past the 'I've seen it all before' excesses of this endlessly clichéd chase movie. This tosh plays like its only audience will be uneducated teens or bikie gangs. Gibson plays the Gibson of so many other boringly silly-kick-ass flicks that it's no wonder he looks so frazzled (although years of booze hasn't helped). Written by Peter Craig in the style of 'I need the easy money' genre and directed with the same feel by Jean-Francoise Richet. This foolishly tired trash fest, lambasts its way to an entirely predictable finish - and even though it only runs 88 mins feels like it should have been 15mins shorter! Erin Moriarty plays Gibson's space-cadet teenage daughter like she's auditioning for a game panel show. Hers is one super-dill of a character that at best can only annoy the viewer to the point of wishing the evil gangs would put her out of her misery (or ours). One particular scene of Mel at a phone booth looks as if it were shot on a mobile phone by an untrained kid who had just bought their first phone! Michael Parks is again wasted in one of his final roles - along with William H. Macy, who's reduced to little more than an extra. Only for easily pleased lovers of grotesque movies - anyone else, save your time for something of worth.Oh, and don't be fooled by the Rotten Tomatoes ratings - seems to have been a bunch of film-school kids on duty for this one...or maybe a bunch of bad fruit peddlers."
" The redemptive arc and central father-daughter relationship make it stand out.
",2018-02-18 00:00:00,7,"'Blood Father (2016)' is at its best when it explores the relationship between the central ex-con protagonist and his estranged daughter, using the 'on the run' conceit as a lens through which to view this unconventional dynamic rather than just a plot device to add tension. Its in these quieter moments that the picture actually shines, when it allows Gibson to capitalise on his outcast status and genuine acting talent to fully embody a fairly well-written character who's connection with his kid is believable, a bit unique and also quite resonant. The film can't maintain this off-kilter indie-darling drama feel for too long, though. It is interspersed with fits of furious violence that are entertaining in themselves but often feel far more generic than deserved and don't do justice to the interesting characters involved in them. They tend to make the piece as a whole seem like a more common action-film but really its the redemptive arc and central relationship that makes it stand out as more. The finale, though a little anti-climactic and a tad clichéd, is a fittingly violent end that keeps its sights set on the heart of the flick. Its this rough but still beating heart that makes it a memorable experience. 7/10"

" Gibson Is Back in Form in an Action-Thriller
",2018-02-02 00:00:00,6,"Down and out John Link (Mel Gibson), an ex-husband, ex-convict, and ex-alcoholic with a runaway 18-year-old daughter whom he hasn't seen in four years, addresses his AA support group. If he only knew that his daughter Lydia Jane Carson (Erin Moriarty) has just accidentally shot her longtime junkie boyfriend, Jonah (Diego Luna), when his gang intruded on a family's residence and killed someone. As she is on the run from the gang, he soon will be. Link supports himself by his tattoo parlor that he runs in his dilapidated trailer that is located in a wasteland. As the gang searches for Lydia she calls up dad, asking for $2,000. They make arrangements and he picks her up and takes her to his trailer. Not long after she sees the trailer in daylight, she says, ""It kind of looks like you miss the comforts of jail."" Ah, the little muddler of bad decisions has spoken! Anyway, somehow the bad druggie gang tracks down Link's remote trailer (in the dark!) and eventually wrecks it. Why it was done is a mystery. After all, they didn't really know that Lydia was hiding inside. But the jig is up and Link and daughter go on the lam. As the two flee, there are various adventures and escapes that involve lowlifes, a seedy hotel, a chase by Confederate/Nazi bikers, etc. A trailer buddy has helped him (Kirby = William H. Macy, an undeveloped character). But eventually the bad guys capture the little duffer and Link has to rescue her. Will he make it? Will Lydia survive? Anyway, that is the plot. Of significance in the film is the reconciliation, the restoration of the relationship between father and daughter, and this issue covers much of the movie's mid-section. The chemistry between the two leads works just fine, including the generational gap differences. Ultimately there is enough grit, witty dialog, and action so that Mel Gibson fans will not be disappointed."
" Well done, movie that not many make anymore

",2018-01-08 00:00:00,6,"Lydia Carson (Erin Moriarty) is running with gangsters under the control of boyfriend Jonah (Diego Luna). He tries to force her to kill but she ends up shooting him instead. On the run from the gangsters, she seeks help from her estranged ex-con father John Link (Mel Gibson).It's one of those hard crime thrillers where it's important to point the camera at Erin Moriarty's butt. I don't want to hate on people who revel in butt shoots. For me, it moves it away from a good hard neo-noir thriller. There's value to that move but without it, the movie could try for something darker and more brutal. Mel Gibson has it in him to be in a cruel viscous movie and this is set up for that. This is not that. It's a bit of action fun with a sprinkling of grimy dirt and an old hand in the genre. It works as such but it's not much more than that. The father daughter chemistry is fine. Gibson gives as much as he can. It tries to amp up the dialogue. It adds up to a solid B-movie."
" Good, straightforward action flick.
",2017-11-29 00:00:00,6,"Classic story with good guy (well, good might be stretching it), in this case the father, trying to save chick from the bad guys. The bad guys are of course totally dislikeable murderous thugs with a distinctly below average intelligence.Mel Gibson plays the role of ex-con, caring father and kick-ass protector of his daughter quite well. He pretty much makes this movie which is a roller-coaster action ride. As with most of this type of action flicks the story and script is fairly mediocre. His old and not very trustworthy friend for example was not really adding any value and his actions was soooo predictable.The thugs, although certainly projecting the required amount of ""despicable bad-guy-ness"", were really nothing more than that. Stupid, stupid and more stupid. How they even manage to track John and Lydia down all the time is really beyond me.With that said it was a enjoyable movie. The one were you just relax in the sofa, watch the scenery and arses being kicked. The stuff that Mel Gibson is really good at."
" Gibson and Moriarty's screen chemistry helps the film to an extent, but the film itself is rather clichéd and is quite dull at times
",2017-11-25 00:00:00,5,"Recovering alcoholic and ex-con Link (Mel Gibson) is trying to get his life straight by avoiding getting in to trouble. Link's life is turned upside down when his estranged daughter Lydia (Erin Moriarty) calls him and asks him for help when she find herself on the run from the cartel. Link reluctantly has to return to his old life in order to protect his daughter...Blood Father is another actioner whereby we have a middle-aged bad-ass father who is forced to go to back in to his former life/existence in order to protect a loved one. This is something that Liam Neeson has pretty much perfected over the years (most notably in Taken) - although this film shares more in common in a more recent Neeson film called Run All Night where Neeson played a recovering alcoholic forced to go back to his old life and protect his child.It's not a bad premise and when handled correctly it can make for a good film, but Gibson's character here is a little too whiny and full of self-pity (necessary to an extent I suppose, but it was overdone here and at times I found his character to be a little tiresome). On the other hand, his young co-star Erin Moriarty was a joy to watch; she's sassy, ballsy, but with the slightest hint of vulnerability. This in itself is a rather clichéd role, but Moriarty sells it well and she bounces off Gibson really well; her carefree persona and his grumpy old man shtick do at times serve the film well giving it some much needed light-heartedness. Where this film does suffer slightly is in the pacing and action stakes; the story is a tad laborious and the action sequences come far too infrequently - it also occasionally does seem to rely on the most unlikely of contrivances to move the story along.Taken for what it is, this is a serviceable and watchable action film with good performances from Gibson and Moriarty - they bounce off each other well and convey a very genuine father/daughter bond on screen. But the truth is that the film suffers when Moriarty and Gibson are not on screen together due to the film's rather laborious pace and lack of action. Worth a look, but don't set your sights too high with this one."

",2017-10-25 00:00:00,7,"Apparently this movie is based on a novel of the same name and a French action thriller. I did not know this and I'm surprised. Surprised that's its a French made movie because I certainly didn't get that vibe in the trailers. And I'm surprised at yet another novel adaptation, like almost every other flick!Again the plot is nothing really original (a rarity these days), its main hook is the fact we see old Mel Gibson back in action again. The plot starts with Lydia (Erin Moriarty) who is in a relationship with a gang leader called Jonah (Diego Luna). During a hit on some tenants Jonah claims stole money from them, Lydia accidentally shoots Jonah. Thinking she's killed him she runs off and gets in contact with her ex-convict father John (Gibson). Lydia explains the situation and John decides to look after Lydia at his trailer house in the middle of nowhere (hoping no one will find them). Alas Jonah's gang members come after Lydia and drag John into the fray. What follows is a somewhat slow moving chase thriller as John must protect Lydia from the gang out for revenge.I think the problem with this movie is the fact it doesn't really offer anything new (plus it literally feels like it could be another movie about old man Wolverine/Logan). Gibson's character is your standard gruff, hardassed, tattooed, ex-con who's turned his life around and deep down has a good heart. His slutty looking daughter Lydia is your typical slutty looking mouthy teen, who has gotten herself into sh*t and needs her daddy to bail her out. All the while being somewhat ungrateful about it along the way. The bad guys are your stereotypical tattooed Latino gangsters. And most of the folk we meet along the way are all scruffy looking redneck biker types, complete with some Nazi and Confederate imagery for good measure.As the story unfolds its not hard to guess what's gonna happen really. Obviously at first John and Lydia are a tad distant, Lydia doesn't completely trust John, and John wants to ween Lydia off the drugs and alcohol she's hooked on. It really is the all the usual beats. John must ask favours from various friends, some good like Kirby (William H. Macy) and some not so good like Preacher (Michael Parks). Speaking of stereotypical characters, Preacher has his own biker garage/club set up where he sells all his (Nazi and Confederate) war memorabilia. You know straight away not to trust this bloke. Anyway as time passes John and Lydia grow closer together until at the end Lydia realises how much she loves and needs John (naturally when its too late).I guess the million Dollar question was, was the films main selling point of Mel Gibson being the anti-hero protagonist enough? Could Gibson still deliver a knockout? In my opinion the answer to that would yes and no. Lets not beat around the bush here, Gibson has clearly changed his image in recent years. He's clearly been hitting the gym and getting roided up (health issues at his age?). Anyway performance-enhancing drugs aside, Gibson does look good despite the ravages of time on his looks. Strangely enough he actually looks even more badass in his old age and possibly even more of a better fit for an aged Wolverine.Gibson definitely dishes out a solid weighty performance bursting with raw scary beardy-faced energy. In fact his beard is almost its own character, its an awesome beard, the white patch on his chin being the clear highlight. So much so that when he shaves it off his character noticeably becomes less interesting. All of a sudden we lose the unhinged, wide-eyed, muscular, Wolverine-esque, bearded one. And we're left with a boring looking Mel Gibson from 'Payback' (1999). The thing is I believe you could swap out Gibson with any number of decent action thriller actors such as...Denzel Washington, Russell Crowe or Liam Neeson, and probably get the same result. So even though I liked Gibson in this movie, I'd say his presence wasn't a make or break factor.Overall I'd have to say I was actually somewhat disappointed with this movie. The trailer was pretty epic and kinda gave me the wrong impression really. I was expecting a more rock 'em, sock 'em action flick top heavy with kickassery. But what you get is a more heartfelt, slow paced drama with the odd burst of action that isn't really that good. Yes its authentic, its not over the top and stupid, but I just got the impression we'd be seeing more of Gibson kicking ass. We actually see very little of Gibson kicking ass which seems a waste considering all that muscle he's packed on. In the end the movie finishes as you knew it would do, in fact I'm sure we've all seen the same ending before in other movies. I can't help but think this could have been a really stonking gritty action flick, but Gibson wanted to show his acting chops (which aren't quite there I'm afraid). Its by no means a bad film or a mediocre film, its a very solid film, just not as good as the posters and trailers make out.7/10"

" Mel Gibson: Action Hero
",2017-09-18 00:00:00,6,Mel Gibson portrays an ex-con who's daughter resurfaces in a metric ton load of trouble. Like drug cartel henchmen hunting you down to kill you trouble. Erin Moriarty portrays the troubled teen in deep doo-doo.What follows would make Mad Max proud. Mel's still got the action chops and the movie was enjoyable overall. Good for a rental.
" This'll Exceed Most People's Expectations
",2017-09-09 00:00:00,8,"Most people will expect ""Blood Father"" to be a modest, run-of-the-mill, action thriller with an uninspiring story but it's actually much better than that. Whilst its plot wouldn't win any prizes for originality, its fast pace, brilliant dialogue and well-choreographed action sequences make it compelling to watch and a storming performance by Mel Gibson (who does anger and frustration so well), adds plenty of intensity and edginess. The well-drawn characters at the centre of the story are a father and daughter who have to go on the run together and their unorthodox relationship and entertaining banter provide a great deal of interest and enjoyment as they both gradually discover that they're actually much closer to their own redemptions than either of them realise.Lydia Link (Erin Moriarty), a teenager who ran away from home a few years earlier, is living with her 30-year-old boyfriend, Jonah (Diego Luna). He's a drug dealer with family connections to a Mexican drug cartel and as part of his operation, uses a number of ""stash houses"" in which he stores some of his merchandise. When it appears that the drugs in one of the houses have gone missing, Jonah and his gang, accompanied by Lydia, go there and terrorise the tenants. When this doesn't produce any useful information, Jonah kills the man of the house and having given Lydia a gun, orders her to shoot the woman. After a few moments of hesitation and panic, Lydia accidentally shoots Jonah in the neck and thinking that she's killed him, immediately goes on the run. Terrified and with no-one else to turn to, she phones her estranged father, John (Mel Gibson), and asks him for money and whatever help he can give her.John Link is an ex-con and recovering alcoholic who lives in a trailer park and earns money as a tattoo artist. His only remaining friend is Kirby Curtis (William H Macy) who is his AA sponsor and lives in one of the neighbouring trailers. After his long career as a criminal, John is desperately trying to go straight and live a peaceful life but when his long-lost daughter contacts him for help, he can't refuse.After meeting up with Lydia, John takes her back to his trailer where he thinks she can lay low for a while but this soon proves to be impossible when some members of Jonah's gang turn up and demand that she be handed over to them. When John refuses, they ram and topple over his trailer with their SUV and it's only when some of his armed neighbours appear on the scene that the gang eventually decides to retreat. Realising that there's no way that they can safely remain at his home; John decides to go on the run with Lydia to escape the danger that she's in from Jonah's gang. It soon becomes clear however, that her predicament is worse than they realised as she's also being pursued by a Mexican drug cartel hit-man and the police who are following up their investigations into what happened at the stash house. A number of very tense and dangerous situations then follow as John and Lydia repeatedly come close to being killed before events lead them to the story's final, violent confrontation.One of the surprises of this movie is how well the relationship between John and Lydia is depicted as, after years apart, they rapidly build up a rapport which often involves sarcasm on John's part whenever he realises that his daughter has made so many of the same mistakes that he's made in his life. Despite the hard-boiled nature of some of their exchanges, the underlying affection that they feel for each other is constantly apparent and the subtlety with which this is conveyed is one of the most impressive features of Gibson and Moriarty's performances.""Blood Father"" is full of humour and witty one-liners (e.g. ""she's every loser's lucky day"" and ""Kid, you've got the mindset of a battered housewife"") and is also well-directed with great use being made of its locations and a neat symmetry being achieved by the similarity of Gibson's first appearance on-screen and Moriarty's last. This is definitely a movie that impresses with its well-disciplined and no-nonsense approach and will certainly exceed the expectations of most people who see it."
" don't watch this
",2017-09-01 00:00:00,1,"its awful. over acted by some, and poorly acted by others.The script is so thin and basic, it really is a waste of time. Comparing this to Mad Max Mel Gibson is a joke.The audio is mixed by someone who likes to deafen you by the sound of engines and gunshots, whilst struggling to hear the voices.don't bother."
" Blood Father
",2017-08-27 00:00:00,5,"After the Oscar wins and nominations for the brilliant Hacksaw Ridge, the Braveheart leading star and director is slowly getting back into Hollywood's good book, and I was looking forward to watch him return his action movie routes, directed by Jean-François Richet (Assault on Precinct 13). Basically teenager Lydia (Captain Fantastic's Erin Moriarty) buys bullets for her boyfriend Jonah (The Terminal's Diego Luna), after loading up, he and his gang go to kill a tenant family who apparently stole money stashed in the walls of their rented house. Jonah kills another tenant, then ties up another and forces Lydia to kill her, she then accidentally fires the gun at Jonah, shooting him in the neck, apparently killing him, she escapes the crime scene. Lydia contacts her estranged father John Link (Mel Gibson), an American war veteran, ex-convict and recovering alcoholic, out on parole after serving seven years in prison. John picks up Lydia and takes him to his trailer house, he learns that she is not only a drug addict but also an alcoholic. Some time passes, but Lydia continues to receive text messages from an unknown number, death threat from the gang members, she explains her situation in detail to John. One night, members of Jonah's gang try to force themselves into John's house, opening fire and trying to ram it with their SUV, until John's neighbour and sponsor Kirby (William H. Macy) and other armed residents rush to intervene, forcing the gang to retreat. John was initially determined not break the conditions of his parole, but he reasons that going to the police will put Lydia in danger, so they flee together, on the run Lydia tells John about running away from home, and about Jonah, who turns out to be a well-connected member of a Mexican drug cartel. After stopping at a motel and narrowly escaping a cartel, John attempts to get help from his former mentor and friend Preacher (Michael Parks), who makes a living by collecting and selling war memorabilia, but Preacher changes his mind after learning there is a reward for turning in Lydia. John overpowers Preacher and his wife Cherise (True Blood's Dale Dickey), and escapes with Lydia on a 1997 Harley Softail, they are pursued by two of Preacher's men, they are both killed in the chase. While Lydia dyes her hair to obscure her identity, John shaves his beard, he travels to a prison where he meets his former cellmate Arturo Rios (Miguel Sandoval), who has information about Jonah's connections, he learns Jonah stole the money himself from the cartel, blamed the tenants, and murdered them to cover his tracks. At the motel, Lydia receives a call from Kirby that she in danger to meet him at a crowded public place like a theatre, there Lydia is confronted by Jonah, who survived his injury, she is abducted by him and his gang. After leaving the prison, John calls Kirby, but Jonah answers, revealing that he captured Kirby, and kills him, John warns Jonah about harming Lydia, citing his knowledge of his connections, he offers his own life in exchange for his daughter, and they arrange a meeting at a secluded spot in the desert. John goes back to Preacher's place and picks up a landmine and some grenades, arriving at the meeting point, he improvises a booby trap with the landmine placed under his bike. John is tied up by the men and put in the car with Lydia, as they prepare to leave, two men move the bike and are killed by the explosion, John kills the gang member inside the vehicle, but Jonah escapes. The other gang members have found a vantage point in the rocks above, John is wounded by gunshots, he and Lydia take cover behind the car, John forces the remaining gang member to get closer, the two fatally shoot each other, Lydia tearfully watches his father die in her arms. In the end, Jonah is arrested and incarcerated, he comes face to face with a a visibly hostile prison gang led by Arturo, one year later Lydia is attending a support group, she reveals that she has been sober for a year and expresses gratitude to her father. Also starring Richard Cabral as Joker, Thomas Mann as Jason the Motel Clerk and Raoul Max Trujillo as The Cleaner. Gibson doesn't seem to have lost his mojo in the genre that made him a star, Moriarty is good as the vulnerable teen, Luna is a relatively good villain, Macy is worth mentioning as the hero's sponsor, and Parks as the creepy white supremacist. You could argue that it echoes themes in the Taken series, without the kidnap element of course (well, not until near the end), and you cannot take any of it seriously, it is just a load of guns blazing, fast chases and explosions that will please the crowd, nothing wrong with that, a reasonable action thriller. Worth watching!"
" Not down and dirty enough
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,3,"Blood Father is a disappointing and derivative revenge flick with Mel Gibson playing Link, a grizzled ex con on parole, trying to stay straight and recovering from drink and drugs.He lives in a trailer, works as a tattooist and he spends everyday talking to his sponsor Kirby (William H Macy) who is also his neighbour.Out of the blue his missing daughter Lydia (Erin Moriarty) contacts him as she needs money. She has shot her gangster boyfriend lover Jonah (Diego Luna) in the neck and now fears for his life.Link in order to protect his daughter has to step up to the plate, putting his parole at risk as he heads for a showdown against Jonah's gang pursuing them.Gibson is plainly a B movie action star these days making lower budget films that look a bit cheap with a script that lacks polish and finesse. Maybe things will change since his Oscar nomination for Best Director for Hacksaw Ridge.Here Gibson is let down by choppy action scenes and a below average script which at times is incoherent. Even with its short running time it looks flabby."
" One of the best films of 2016!
",2017-08-04 00:00:00,10,"WOW! Mel's still got it!WHY has this film never been promoted or advertised? I have never heard of it and just randomly came upon it.I have to say, it's one of the best movies of 2016 and one of Mel's best films - right up there with Mad Max!Great work guys!Loved it - it's a 10/10 from me!"
" Gibson makes an unmemorable comeback
",2017-07-31 00:00:00,4,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Link (Mel Gibson) is an ex-con, trying to keep on the straight and narrow, running a home-tattoo business, while liaising with his sponsor Kirby (William H. Macy.) But then his estranged daughter Lydia (Erin Moriarty) comes back into his life, after shooting her drug lord lover Jonah (Diego Luna) in the face during a bungled initiation. With Jonah hot on her trail, Link is forced back into his old way of life to protect her.Mel Gibson is a name you see considerably less these days. It is rumoured Hollywood is run 95% by Jews, and so his roadside scandal that resulted in his anti-Semitic rant may have cost him more than he could ever have imagined. But here and there he still pops up, never losing that 'movie star' appeal, but failing to appear in anything of real substance that could really get his career going again, such as Blood Father.To be fair, in his 50+ years, Gibson still cuts a fine figure, and suits the action hero persona just fine. Just as well, as he's caught up in some pretty heavy duty action sequences here, that don't squirm on the blood letting and unflinching physical intensity. There even seems to be a nod to his old Mad Max days during a bike chase sequence. But it's all just too formulaic and unremarkable to make any real impression, even if it is all wrapped up in under an hour and a half.Still, for those wondering what's happened to Mel, it will probably still come as a bit of good news. **"
" Terrible
",2017-07-31 00:00:00,1,This movie is such a let down. I expected so much after reading all the glowing reviews here. Both the viewers reviews and critics reviews were good. What's wrong with you people?Don't trust any of the reviews here. 0/10.
" Gibson's best movie in years
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,7,"BLOOD FATHER is an intense little action thriller that also happens to be Mel Gibson's best film as an actor since EDGE OF DARKNESS. The plot is nothing special and sees Gibson playing the usual eccentric hard-bitten type, living in a trailer and estranged from his family. His daughter's involvement with a gang of Mexican drug dealers sees her returning to him to ask from his help, and a chase scenario unfolds from there.This film is well-shot throughout and efficiently low key. Instead of the fun but over the top mayhem of a JOHN WICK film, in which our protagonist bumps off hundreds of foes effortlessly, Gibson and co. just have five or six tough types ranged against them. The running time is short and the pace snappy, full of hard-bitten dialogue and decent performances from a supporting cast including Michael Parks, Diego Luna, William H. Macy, and Miguel Sandoval. Another treat is that Erin Moriarty isn't your stereotypical whining, bratty adolescent but instead an intelligent-thinking adult too. Gibson is on top form, as always, and the brief but violent bouts of action are expertly staged."
" Qualities make up for the flaws – good, gritty entertainment
",2017-06-02 00:00:00,7,"Although Blood Father does not bring anything new to the table in terms of storytelling, it manages to provide decent entertainment by taking advantage of its filming locations, a good cast and somewhat interesting, although undeveloped, lead characters. Link (Mel Gibson) is an ex-con turned tattoo artist and former alcoholic who lives a reasonably quiet life in a trailer park home. One day, he receives a phone call from his daughter, Lydia, who has gone missing for many years, and who's seeking help, as drug dealers and law enforcement are trying to track her down. Sounds familiar? It probably does. It's a very classic story, and make no mistake about it, this tale is quite typical of the genre. I would even go as far as to say that story-wise, this film is sub-par and plot development is almost nonexistent. Add an anticlimactic and abrupt ending, and an almost shameful use of pretty interesting supporting characters, one has to wonder what Blood Father really has to offer.The answer is an overall pretty good time, despite its flaws, thanks to sympathetic characters, above-average dialogue for the genre, some gritty moments, very welcome touches of humor and great cinematography. Jean-François Richet, who directed the biographical films about Jacques Mesrine, does a pretty good job too.Again, it's a shame to make such little use of Kirby (William H. Macy) and Preacher (Michael Parks), but their presence is appreciated while it lasts. The Sicario character's first appearance is blood chilling, but unfortunately, the character's mystique evaporates from lack of screen time and further significant appearances. Mel Gibson is perfect in his role and Erin Moriarty (Lydia) is pretty good as well. The chemistry between both characters is tangible, and the generational clash sub-theme is subtle, but interesting nonetheless. Moreover, there are a few sequences, such as the first scene at the store and the scene when Link and Lydia are in the back of a truck filled with illegal Mexican immigrants, where the film humorously takes aim at some absurdities, such as a minor buying boxes of ammo without being asked for her ID, but being denied a pack of cigarettes because she's underage, or Lydia countering her dad's argument that illegal Mexican immigrants are ""stealing"" fruit-picking jobs from white Americans.While the film offers some nice set-pieces, as a sequence of events, Blood Father's script does not profit from the best possible dramatic continuity, and ultimately falls short on delivering any truly memorable moment whatsoever. In that regard, the writing feels very uneven, as it delivers in the dialogue department, but lacks truly interesting ideas or ingenuity story-wise.That being said, its qualities are likely to draw you in for its hour and a half runtime, and should manage to entertain anyone who likes this type of flick."
" Like ""Taken"" but a bad copy.
",2017-05-06 00:00:00,2,"I think when you copy a highly successful movie like ""Taken"" where the the ""particular set of skills"" speech has become famous then expect to fail unless you try 50 yrs later. Liem Neeson cannot be copied, period. That role of a father started out like a normal guy but from that speech on you were intrigued to who exactly was this guy? In this movie, there is no such intrigue.Having said that, I expected a helluva a lot better acting from Mel Gibson. Mel can bring it on when he wants to yet there were certain scenes overacted most notably with Michael Parks (Preacher). I blame Michael Parks and his low energy. So low I thought the character he played had Alzheimer's or had had a stroke. Turns out is was simply bad acting.As for Erin Moriarty, she is better than this. In this role, she simply is not convincing.I don't know why I had a tough time believing William Macy. (Maybe because the story-line sucks sticky eggs?) His acting was good enough but somehow the setup and character development never happened. I blame the editing.Diego Luna, on the other hand, is great. And, for the short time she was on screen, Dale Dickey (Cherise), was spot on as always."
" Cliché revenge flick
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,3,"I love Mel Gibson but this movie was trash. Horrible supporting acting. Cliché plot and even Gibson was average at best. I wish this movie was never made. Even the action sequences were sub par.Gibson totally fails at the whole ""bad dad trying to do right"" role. There are so many movies just like this but better that watching it is just a complete waste of time.Overall I would say avoid this movie unless you are extremely bored."
" Somehow in the cliché premise, they delivered complex characters
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,9,"This movie has a terrible title and the synopsis sounds cliché. That said, I was so pleasantly engaged. Mel Gibson is captivating in this, reminding us why he's one of the best actors. Erin Moriarty-who gave a great performance in Jessica Jones-also gives a great performance, exchanging some great dialogue scenes with Mel. The movie takes a cliché premise and really adds some heart into it. Gibson's character is an ex con trying to live a pure life while also trying to take care of his daughter who is going down a bad path. He wants to turn her in so he doesn't face more time but knows she won't survive alone creating a great moral dilemma. The movie is really at heart a father-daughter road trip movie with two rich characters bonding over their poor life decisions. This could go very wrong, but everyone involved did a great job adding a heart to this movie."
" Strong movie
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,7,"I am gonna make a short review of this one. I heard it was good and i always liked Mel Gibson so i tough why not? Premise looked great even tough it was direct to DVD. And sure thing it was good.I tough there would be a bit more action in it, but the characters and story is actually pretty strong to keep you interest in the movie. So you could say a few pacing issues, but never big enough to distract you from enjoying it.Gibson show that despite his age he can still kick ass and is in a great physical shape. Definitely recommend to see this movie once."
" Unexpected take on a familiar genre which means awesome!
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,10,"Mel Gibson rules...The man is a damn fine actor and when he's given a script perfect for him it's just a magical result.Going into the film I thought I was going to see another clichéd action flick but I was pleasantly surprised.The characters have time to breathe and develop and the casting is impeccable. All the characters are super likable and the actors really did a great job.Mel Gibson's character is a bad ass. A true bad ass. Not some dumb wannabe bad ass, but a true bad ass and you're rooting for him the whole time. It's very refreshing to see a well-written bad ass in this age of wussy heroes.It reminded me of the best of Clint Eastwood and Arnold Schwarzenegger, but it's Mel Gibson, so it's even better.Action scenes are really well choreographed and there are lots of comedic moments sprinkled throughout.Throw out your preconceived notions of this film...it's a pleasant surprise.Also William H. Macy is in it! Schwing!"
" A good movie with a lot of guns, action and a great Mel Gibson
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,7,"Mel Gibson is one the most diverse actors of his generation and although many people might not like him they cannot deny his talent. ""Blood Father"" is proof for his talent. While it is of course not as magnificent and deep as many other Mel Gibson movies it is still a good thriller. Mel Gibson shines in this role and presents himself from a totally different side. He is ripped, foulmouthed and tattooed but he still delivers as solid performance. This movie reminds a bit of Mel Gibson's earlier piece ""Edge of Darkness"" but it is good in it's own way. The story is well thought out and all characters deliver solid performances. Gibson and Moriarty have a good chemistry. One thing that was bothering me throughout the movie though was that we never find out what exactly happened to Gibson's character and why exactly he went to jail for 9 years. All in all this is a good movie with a good as usual Mel Gibson, some good action sequences and a lot of heart."
" Mel Gibson makes a triumphant return in this dark, gritty tale of redemption
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,8,"Since his antisemitic remarks surfaced to the media, Mel Gibson, the man who made himself in star in George Miller's Mad Max franchise, has slowly fell from the fame. Many fans have wonder when the old star would return to the big screen. After a short hiatus from major roles, Gibson returns to the screen in this gritty action thriller directed by Jean-Francois Richet. Taking on the role as a man wrestling with his inner demons, Gibson becomes the cinematic force to reckon with, spawning a performance that is far from more visceral and electrifying than what he has played in the past decade. His magnetic portrayal becomes the film's major peak that manages to rise above its hefty narrative. Although the film follows a rather familiar story, Richet handles it with great versatility and substance. By the end, it feels something more than just your average shoot-em-up powerhouse. This follows John (played by Mel Gibson), a ex-convict living in a trailer park, trying to sober up from his alcoholism. He spends his days attending support groups sponsored by his neighbor Kirby (played by William H. Macy). When he gets a call from his estranged daughter Lydia (played by Erin Moriarty) who's hooked on drugs and is involved with a vicious drug cartel, John shelter her in his trailer home where he must protect her from the cartel who are setting out to kill her.Perhaps the film is more of a drama with violent action scenes than a straightforward action flick. After all, it is the emotionally jarring nature of the Mel Gibson's character that serves as the driving force of the film. The story depicts the lead character as a man trying to recover from his dreadful past and move on to a new road of sobriety, but suddenly must fight an intense battle against the life he's tried leaving behind when his estranged child races to his aid from a situation he greatly frowns upon. From there on, the relationship between him and his unclean daughter is developed without resorting to typical cliché of the girl hating her father for the man he's become. The man is greatly shined with a powerful performance by Mel Gibson who's made his return as an action hero since his final outing in the 'Lethal Weapon' franchise. He greatly invests himself in the role that allows him to do more than show off his muscular physique, but to expand his acting muscle in a genre he has since veered away from for many years. When the guns starts blazing and the bullets begin brutally tearing through the baddies, is when Gibson exercises the role to his fullest extent while also feeling reminiscent to his role as Mad Max in the early days (especially with the hot western setting). Erin Moriarty is good at her role as well, but far from matching up her much older co-star. In terms of the narrative, the plot moves at fairly an equitable pace and packs an emotional punch that can felt from the opening five minutes to the jarring final stretch.Blood Father marks a triumphant on screen return for Mel Gibson in arguably the most visceral role he endured in recent years. It is a smart, gripping action thriller blossoming with grit and atmosphere as well as one that may never render as a classic, but will entertain those looking for Gibson to return as the action hero that made him a star."
" predictable plot
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,6,"Mel Gibson is back as another tough guy, but not the cop but the drinking/doping tattoo guy that has a hard time staying out of trouble. His daughter, Lydia, has a drug dealing boyfriend and she accidentally shoots him and thinks he's dead. So she's on the run from his gang buddies and cartel members. She goes to her dad, Link, for help. The bad guys find them and then it is a road movie. They are being chases by them and the cops. Eventually the badies get the girl and Link must pull all the stops to get her safe. One good thing is the movie is short, so no filler and the gun fights were good. FINAL VERDICT: I'd recommend if you want an action film."
" Well made, but just lacking in a bit of creativity
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,7,"I hadn't ever realised it until I was watching 'Blood Father' just now, but Mel Gibson has never made, nor starred in, a bad film. There have certainly been some that aren't as good as others, but you really couldn't say any of them were absolute stinkers. He would have to be considered one of the most sure-signs of quality in Hollywood. 'Blood Father' is another high-quality film to add to the list.The only problem I really had with this film was that it plays out with your standard action movie formula. Nothing feels overly original or ground-breaking in any way. It makes up for that fact though by doing every thing is does to a very high standard. The acting is superb (mainly from Gibson, but every cast member delivers a strong performance), the action scenes are tense, violent and easy to follow and the story is well paced and never falls into a lull. I also enjoyed the violence levels in 'Blood Father'. Nothing ever felt off limits and every character felt vulnerable in every scene. 'R' ratings never cease to make films better. I do wish it had managed a little more originality, but putting that aside it's a very well made and enjoyable flick."
" Stuck in first gear
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,6,"It had potential but never quite gathers momentum. The story traverses familiar ground, a well-worn plot in another form. As we go through the motions to reach the predictable conclusion, the ride is fun at times but never exciting, surprising, gripping or original.Mel Gibson does a good job and holds it together reasonably well. Supporting actors are nothing special, but in fairness they didn't have a quality script to work with.It's not that bad, but I was hoping for better... perhaps darker with less stereotypes and formula."
" Welcome back, Mel. We missed you
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,9,"South Park said it best, ""Say what you want about Mel Gibson but the son of a gun knows story structure"". This movie was such a pleasant surprise. And anything with motorcycle chases is an automatic plus for me...except Torque that's just bad.struggle to see the film as all that similar to Taken. It shares the idea of a father with skills saving his daughter, but beyond that they're very different. This movie is primarily about the relationship between a father and a daughter with some action. Taken sets up a relationship with the daughter, and then the movie about the action saving her. It's about a father that is trying to save the only thing good in his life her daughter knowing well there is no going back for him pushing everything to save her and not caring for his life in the process.the movie is grounded to reality in a very believable and convincing way with a satisfying ending. what got my attention and was very clever is building the tension throughout the movie with minimal usage of music ,not like most of movies do these days, most of the tension is felt through the characters performance and camera movement. t was a great balance of story, action, pacing, suspense, and even a bit of intrigue with the part about the cartel dealer.Regarding the biker ranch, I think that provided some backstory to Gibson's character, showing why he was such a bad ass. If it's not Gibson's official comeback as an actor, not sure what will it take for me it was and I highly recommend it"
" Certainly no 'Lethal Weapon'
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,2,"Terrible film. It is one of those contrived set ups which quickly has you wondering whether you care what happens to anyone.There are no likable, believable characters. The story line is so poor the whole film could have been played out in 10 minutes. The various characters were so plastic it is a wonder that they didn't melt in the desert sun.The daughter, supposedly 17 years old, is so unreal and uninteresting, her father, Mel, would have been forgiven for letting her continue to do her own thing.Why Mel Gibson was connected with this film whilst directing the fantastic Hacksaw Ridge is beyond me.Best to wait until the DVD is in the charity shops if you really want to watch it sometime.When I first saw the rating it was at 8.4 and I thought I was in for a good film.Wrong. The rating really needs to be brought down to give viewers a more realistic level of expectation - i.e. low."
" This movie is an insult to viewers who expected more from Mel's comeback.
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,5,"I wonder what the going rate is for a 10-star review these days.This movie is an insult to viewers who expected more from Mel's comeback. So many unrealistic, utterly stupid things in it. There was also absolutely no chemistry between Father and Daughter. She was totally wrongly casted and the emotions she experienced were mostly disconnected from the current situation. The script/lines were often weird/off.And the only reason I felt I need to post this is because I feel that this movie could easily be much much better.Rather go (re)watch 'Taken' or 'Man on Fire'."
" What a great movie!
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,8,"I didn't expect to like the movie so much. The best I was hoping for was a ""tried and tested"" movie of the father-saves-daughter-from- bad-guys type. Boy was I wrong. Not a single minute of screen time, not a single script line is wasted, everything is there to help the story move forward and make the audience understand the characters and the motivations behind them. This results in a movie that has a very good feeling of ""motion"", something that so many movies fail to achieve and instead feel boring and repetitive. Kudos to the script writing team. The visuals are fantastic. Everything has a gritty tone to it that feels right in place with the story the movie wants to tell, supported by one of the best casting I've seen. Every character shines on screen, it's as if the roles were written for them specifically. This is a movie full of confidence, and it shows in every scene. I don't get why it's rated so poorly (I would rate higher if IMDb was accepting 0.1 points). One of the best movies of 2016!"
