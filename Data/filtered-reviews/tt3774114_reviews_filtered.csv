" plays out like good fiction -- but this man is a criminal plain and simple
",2021-04-12 00:00:00,9,"As a fan of JGL I finally watched this film, not really understanding who Snowden is. I did a quick online search and then recalled some of the headlines. But although the film was very well done and intriguing, I can't help but ask, is the public really so uneducated as to not realize that the internet does not enjoy the laws set down in the physical world and it doesn't take a genius to realize the government -- any government -- can easily spy on us; more so with the growing technology. Having said that, I'm not really sure that the government should be restricted from using this technology. Yes, I know it was ruled illegal --but mind you, that was not a precedent set for a lawless cyber world but simply restrictions placed on the government we employ to keep us safe. We have an eruption of cybercrime and, therefore, do we not need a military-style ""good guy"" to keep an eye on the bad guy? How should we do this after proof that 911 could have been prevented if only the elite hacker who had been retired by the FBI was allowed to be taken seriously when he noticed the clear indications of a plan to attack the towers? For me, as a patriotic Republican, I feel Snowden violated a very elite position within the US government, putting our very government under a magnifying glass for the world. This is not a ""whistle blower"" -- a lay term meaning someone who reveals inhumane practices within a place of employment; he is indeed guilty of willful communication of classified intelligence to an unauthorized person, which falls under an act of Espionage. Like it or not, when you sign those non-disclosure agreements and go into a highly secure venue, you don't have the right to then disclose anything to anyone. And I personally feel he did it for nothing because as smart as he is technologically, he didn't reveal anything that someone with a high-school diploma couldn't figure out on their own. There is NO guarantee of privacy online. I do have an above average IQ and I do not relate to average people well. But are they really that uninformed? Literally EVERY device or software clearly states you are signing away your expectation of privacy. Why would Ed think we needed him to tell us that? Now we have criminals in Washington switching the votes -- now THAT'S a misuse of technology I would like to see addressed! But what the military does is not nor has ever been up for a democratic vote from the ""informed"" citizens. The average citizen is not equipped to make such determinations. Anyway, I enjoyed the film, it played like a good thriller replete with whiney self-centered girlfriend. But in the end, I do believe Snowden is a criminal of the highest caliber and needs to be brought to the US to stand trial for Espionage, not whistle blowing. If it was me, I would have a crew go pick him up the same way the picked up Osama. There needs to be a strong lesson here regardless if the media or Joe Schmoe agree. We elect the POTUS and the politicians who in turn make these decisions based on our constitution, not based on the most shared fb meme of the day. Ed's arrogance has yielded nothing for him but infamy -- those who already were smart enough to know have not needed to change how they live; and those who were too stupid to know are still too stupid to care. The government certainly hasn't changed their tactics. Ed did that all for attention, or maybe for a bigger payout, which makes him treasonous. It couldn't have been for integrity, he is just not that stupid. Why is he still free in Russia?"
" Wow! If movies could change minds, this one did!
",2021-04-11 00:00:00,10,"The only thing I knew about Snowden before this movie was from casual knowledge from the news and here and there about people who supported him. I thought of him to be a hacker contractor - someone who took advantage of his position on a regular job. Maybe he was right, but it looked more like he was a vigilante gone wild. But this movie changed it all for me. I now look at him with more respect than before. Granted that there is a lot of dramatization and movie thing in all of this, but the explosive and the mind blowing thing were in just a few sentences in the movie about the loss of privacy of the average person and the extent of it that is happening right at this very moment. Unfortunately, I do not think the leaders of this country have realized or are even capable of realizing the dangers. So, the worst of what Snowden feared may already be happening and it may already be too late.Ed Snowden - if you are reading this, my mind has changed about you after watching this move, but the only thing I would fault you for is this: knowing all that you did, maybe you could have just tried to have some hope,risen up the ranks and tried to make the changes that you felt were necessary from the inside. It may have taken time, but it would have had a chance of success. Maybe that is too much burden to place on you, one guy, but that is a Snowden I would have liked to see and would have been a super hero for me."
" I Guess I'm In The Minority Here
",2021-04-05 00:00:00,4,"There once was a time when I felt that too much government oversight was a bad thing, you know, cloaked men with prying eyes watching you everywhere. Our world today is different, unfortunately. Does the government go too far with their surveillance tactics? Sure. I believe so, but I also believe it's in the safety and protection of ordinary folks against bad actors who are CONSTANTLY plotting cybercrimes, terroristic transgressions, etc. The movie was definitely one-sided, that is, Snowden is an angel with wings who is being treated unfairly by the US government. What the movie failed to show was why was their surveillance empire so bad? Because they can watch women undressing in their bedrooms through their laptop cameras? Big deal. Cybercriminals and terrorists are ALWAYS one step ahead of the general populace. It's unfortunate the world has turned into Big Brother, but in the end, it's very necessary."
" The espionage act needs revision
",2021-04-02 00:00:00,10,"The fact that the movie hasn't broke even is amazing. Is America so asleep behind the wheel, they don't recognize that the Freedom they were born into, no longer exists? Or that the privacy they think they have is only the illusion of privacy? Or are they just so drunk on the Koolaid of, If I haven't done anything wrong, I have nothing to fear?Considering our former president pardoned individuals who were found guilty in a court of law, it shouldn't be too much to expect our current president guarantee a fair trial by jury, and fix the broken espionage act so it's used as it was intended.Government whistle blowers, like the news media, help ensure appropriate checks and balances for a Government with nearly unlimited power. It is our citizenry to which all are accountable and who grant such power. Using the full force of the law, under the espionage act, when the Government has been found guilty of breaking the law, makes it appear that ""lady justice"", after all, isn't blind, but quite biased in her views.Like others here who have forwarded the idea that Snowden had other avenues for exposing the wrong perpetuated against American citizens, I believe his fear of a Government with too much power, is what drove him to choose the path he took. Our Government is now proving him correct on that fact and should reconsider the use of the espionage act for addressing what happened."
" Given the back story, you'd think a Snowden movie would get the facts right
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,3,"But it didn't.
The film was rife with small errors and a glaring omission.
In the early scenes, Snowden is supposedly in Army boot camp: 1) When Snowden responds to the Drill Sergeant, he says ""Sir, yes, Sir"" and ""Sergeant"" - that's the Marine Corps. Instead, he should have said ""Yes, Drill Sergeant."" And in the Army, Sir is only used to address warrant officers and officers. 2) Snowden couldn't have fallen from a top bunk - Army boot camp is done in open bays with about 40 single metal beds and lockers - bunk beds in wooden barracks went out after Vietnam. 3) At Yokota Air Base, Snowden would have been in cinder-block base housing. 4) The ""Tokyo"" apartment scene is laughable: Tokyo apts are expensive and tiny; a ""kitchen"" consists of a sink, a two-eye stove, and maybe a dish rack, and it shares space with the dining room. A separate walled off kitchen is only found in (really expensive) condos with multi-decade loans.
And then there's the glaring omission - Snowden took 4 laptops with him, to which he undoubtedly gave Russian and/or Chinese intelligence access as a condition of his safe passage/stay.
Commending some of Snowden's actions is fine, but leaving out his questionable actions and deliberately falsifying facts and events doesn't help his case one iota. And it immediately makes the film far less believable."
" Hollywood at it's worst
",2021-02-18 00:00:00,2,"This is pure propaganda, fiction, and lies. It's unfortunate that most people who watched it have no idea that they've been duped for the sake of money and an agenda."
" Citizenfour's cousin
",2021-02-15 00:00:00,4,"Oliver Stone's realization of the Citizenfour documentary and Snowden's backstory veers into being mostly a political document about technology and surveillance instead of a biopic. And he lets it all hang out. There are many truthful, but cumbersome and exhausting speeches. Tonally, never-ending drollness leaves you wondering when it all will end. The script in all with how overwrought it becomes leads to embarrassing moments as well. The acting is so-so and it's technically competent. Accurate? Check out the boatload of source material it's based on. But it's a terrible, terrible way to drain two hours out of your day. Watch the slightly shorter citizenfour documentary over it. Each techno-thriller offers something two much different insights, but Citizenfour is powerful without artificially inserted drama"
" Excellent
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,10,Fascinating movie and very informative. Well worth anyone's time to watch it.
" 8/10
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,8,"Maybe not the best film in terms of cinematography and acting, but still extremely eye-opening and informative."
" Good film, very informative and engaging
",2021-01-21 00:00:00,8,"I knew this movie didn't do well in the box office so I never bothered watching it but wow. This movie took me by surprise, very engaging movie and explain very well. Such an insane story that needed to be told. The main cast is great in this film. Worth a watch."
" Big Brother is watching us!
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,10,"Totally enjoyed this movie
To think we are all being watching somehow sometime somewhere!
Congratulations to the real Edward Snowden for your determination on exposing the wrong"
" Amazing story, reasonably well told.
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,7,"The true life story of Edward Snowden is undoubtedly a 10 star rating and the film is solid if a bit flawed. Stone sets the opening up well, jumping to when Snowden meets the journalists for the first time and then we backfill. I think Stone does this well and the set up and the way the story unfolds is good. Where it lost its way slightly is the middle drag a a bit. Stone, ironically (given some of his other work) seems to hold back and go for subtlety rather than bombast but all that does is make The film lack tension in places where it needs it. the ending cranks it up a bit but most probably not enough. it won't surprise you that Stone is firmly on Snowdens side. I will do some more research on this subject before I make my judgements but the contents of what he found should worry the whole world."
" Great movie to watch
",2020-11-30 00:00:00,7,"My wife started watching this movie on Netflix. At first I didn't know what she was watching until I started to watch the storyline. I recognized Snowden's character as soon and I yelled out, ""Let me guess, Snowden!"" At first it was kind of slow but I liked how the movie took us through Snowden's life and how he got to meet his girlfriend. Then from there we were hooked. SPOILER WARNING: The ending was this powerful scene where Snowden actually shows up. I loved it."
" For the geeks.
",2020-11-21 00:00:00,8,"I always seek interest in real life occurrences, and this one is no exception.I personally enjoy Levitt's flicks and somehow Levitt resembles so much of Snowden, at least image wise, the speaking formality was kinda odd, because i always thought that Snowden was really calm and had a few pauses during his speech, might be wrong there. Levitt had kinda like a speech where he would just eat a couple of words.I also really liked the fact that they managed to get a Snowden cameo, really brief but it's a nice touch.Story is, movies based on real life events can be at times very good if done well. Might have not been as movie said, but they also warn at the beginning, but movies like this need a bit of a kick to make it more spicy."
" LET IT SNOW!
",2020-11-11 00:00:00,8,"Up there with the best docudramas and among Stone's best and certainly cleanest. Necessarily a little contrived, to do it more verite' would have taken volumes and likely lose focus along the way.
Joseph Gordon-Levitt does well as the low-key human computer with a big, strong heart under all that reserve
Loved it"
" Blue states and good trouble won't save us - great film, another triumph for Oliver Stone
",2020-11-09 00:00:00,10,"It's good to know Stone still has it. Regardless of content, this is an extremely well made, fast moving, taut, visually gripping film. I'll leave it to the cineastes to explain all that. It gets a 10 there.But for casting a light on what goes on in the shadows, it deserves a 20.Consider for a moment - the entire digital economy is built on a ramshackle that was designed to be insecure. In fact, it was designed purposely to have no security at all. TCP/IP networks were invented to have a flexible communication infrastructure that could not be disabled by nuking the phone switches. Every large city has a couple of absolutely hideous buildings, monolithic concrete structures that look like immense cinder blocks, which house the phone switches. In the very recent past, the most high-tech thing in anyone's house was the telephone. To make a call, you must have a direct connection between the two endpoints. To achieve this, a vast set of relay banks was created, partly electronic and partly physical, which interpret the dialed number and route the call from city to city by informing the downstream switch to tell the next one in line - you might have 3 or more middle-points involved. Nuke one of these switches and the call cannot be made. Nuke enough of them - and it's just a handful - and all distant telephone communication would be impossible. So the eggheads sat down to develop a new comm system that would be instantly reconfigurable on the fly. Nuke KC? I'll go through St. Louis. Nuke St. Louis? Peoria. Etc. Security was not the point - quick reconfiguration on the fly was. And we're still conducting all the world's commerce and intelligence over this ramshackle system. By now, many layers of security afterthought have been added, but in the end, it's still the same thing it was in the beginning - an infinitely malleable way to route messages from anywhere to anywhere else that is not dependent of fixed nodes. There is simply no way to secure that in a meaningful way. That is why we have hacking, cybercrime, and cyberterrorism - and it is also why we can dispatch a drone from Hawaii and have it land on a funeral procession in Afghanistan.The government created a vast infrastructure of spying that was based on a chimera - that simply doing brute force exhaustive data collection, ignoring all rights to privacy by anyone, anywhere - would produce actionable intelligence. But in fact it simply plays into the hands of the bad guys. What can be hacked in one direction, can also be hacked in the other.Digital privacy rights and getting out from under the threat of a networking system that is inherently without a proper way to secure it, is by far the greatest human rights issue faced by those of us in the western democracies, who still have a shot at ending this madness and waste. True intelligence professionals will always tell you that good intelligence is targeted intelligence - gathered on the ground, with specific goals in mind. What Edward Snowden really showed us was how absolutely incompetent on the most basic level are all the pointy heads playing the the toys.A great film. Wow."
" Good ""rounding out"" of 'CitizenFour"", SO impressed with Joseph Gordon-Levitt
",2020-11-09 00:00:00,10,"I watched this after watching ""Citizenfour"" several years ago, and rewatching it recently. AND almost directly after seeing ""Hesher"". LOVED, LOVED LOVED Joseph Gordon-Levitt in ""Hesher"" and was very impressed with the range he displayed in ""Snowden"", who, himself, comes across as somewhat naturally shy, serious, guarded person in ""Citizenfour"". I would think it would be more difficult to play a living person with as much accuracy as Gordon-Levitt has, rather than a character who is more open to interpretation and creative license. Perhaps Oliver Stone had a little to do with this, but, I think in most part, it was Gordon-Levitt.
I enjoyed watching this film and the other actors and actresses, and learning the backstory and more details about Mr. Snowden and his life. For those of you who are Snowden fans, I have just read that as of 10/29/20, he and his wife, Lindsay have been granted permanent Russian citizenship AND are expecting their first child, who Snowden has dubbed, ""Citizenfive"". Good luck to them and best wishes from the US. You will be missed, but glad you are happy!"
" Somewhat factually based
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,3,"Disturbing that Oliver Stone would depict Snowden as a hero. He is nothing more than a traitor. In the world we live in, this is the way all intelligence agencies, foreign and domestic operate. The technology has improved, but the operating principals are the same."
" Great thriller kindasorta based on true events
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,7,"Oliver Stone isn't known for his faithfulness to historical fact. That dynamic remains true in ""Snowden,"" an excellent and entertaining, if fictionalized, thriller. Viewers who understand and accept that each side of this particular moral and political dilemma will not receive equally fair consideration in a Stone film will be entertained in spite of the whitewashing of relevant facts.This movie lacks the nuance necessary to illustrate adequately that good people can do the wrong things for the right reasons on both sides of the ideological equation. Snowden was right: The U.S. government was engaging in criminal acts under the guise of national security. That's made clear in the film.What isn't made clear is the seriousness of Snowden's crime when he took it upon himself to release unilaterally highly sensitive, classified information that put the U.S. and its agents at grave risk rather than blow the whistle through proper channels first.Both Snowden and the government were wrong. Both deserve to suffer appropriate consequences. Nevertheless, Snowden is portrayed as wholly good and the U.S. government as wholly bad. Thinking people know things are never that simple.The movie itself is a gem! Well written, well directed, and well acted, with a stellar performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. It's a highly entertaining film and well worth the watch. But if you're looking for a history lesson, this isn't it."
" Authentic
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,7,"I assume that when watching a movie about an actual event that what I am seeing is an historical novel. I am sure that the movie portrayed the overall picture. I enjoyed the movie. I thought it was well done. My only criticism is Snowden's basic training scenes. As a veteran I will say that in the US Army, an NCO is never addressed as ""sir"". I learned that rule on day one."
" Cliche, cliche cliche
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,3,"This is ANYTHING but an unbiased telling of the story. I mean look at the decor of the office for the job interview. All glossy black, barren etc. Typical tyrant decor. Then the voice of the interviewer, 'deep throat' from Watergate anyone? EVERYTHING about this is designed to make the viewer see Snowden as a sinple ""farm-boy do-gooder"" and anyone connected to the CIA/Gov as an evil-doer/tyrant. It would have been fantastic to have actually had a telling of the story instead of a here is what you should think of this story. But Hollywood thinks they are the ones that know what is best for us. I'm not defending the CIA or anyone just saying it would be nice to have a true story instead of Hollywood cliche."
" Stone never disappoints
",2020-09-16 00:00:00,7,"As usual, Oliver Stone has an amazing ability to breakdown and explain the biggest political and social anomalies that the world gives us so the gravity of what's REALLY going on is understood by the masses."
" Unnecessarily dramatic!!
",2020-09-15 00:00:00,4,"This could have been wonderful had it been a documentary. But, the makers, made it look illogical and a bit emotional drama. The motive for CIA to have such programme in first place is clear and it started after the 9/11 attacks. But, the engineers accessing the surveillance, had full right to what to disclose and not that can be used by CIA (or) NSA to make a case out of it. May be, the ethical issue was on them and not on the Government.However, the story discusses it only from Snowden's point of view - ""Is it ethical to have public mass surveillance?"". In the end, as usual, Snowden is projected as a ""hero"" for bringing out the matter to the public. It didn't work with me. But, definitely, a bold attempt!!"
" They are watching you....
",2020-09-10 00:00:00,8,I watched this today after seeing a Oliver Stone interview where he discussed this movie. Snowden isn't a criminal at all but a ethical human being for exposing the truth. Really good watch and well done.
" Hard to Judge This One
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,7,"Great film by Oliver Stone who is obviously right at the top of the pyramid when he is on his game. Having said that, the elephant in the room is that nobody ever mentions to Snowden (this obvious genius) how unusual a person he is intellectually and especially morally compared to the overall population. We have solid proof with hindsight (and which was easily seen with a little foresight) that the stupid sheep don't care about any of this at all and Edward Snowden just hurt Edward Snowden. Whether it is caused by anti-depressant medication or smartphones or both or neither here in Canada 2020 we are literally a nation of 10 year old girls-that is why the mainstream media is so ridiculous now-they understand their audience."
" Incredible story about a genius among other things
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,10,"Joesph Gordon Levit was perfect for this role! Everything that occurs with Snowden's is phenomenal while being devastating and brilliant! I love this movie it's very interesting, powerful, inspirational, well written, and captivating. Anything about the government intrigues me so I'd recommend this to anyone I'm surprised it wasn't nominated a few years ago."
" Great Acting
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,7,"The story is ok, but the acting is great! All casts are top notch!"
" Overall
",2020-06-11 00:00:00,7,"It's a pretty good movie. As the political establishment at the time under that loon GWB used the 9/11 violent acts of jihad as a smokescreen to more than double the size of the federal government. As GWB, like his father before him, didn't have a genuine conservative bone in his freaking leftwing to the core body.As he duped the country into believing the ludicrous fairy tale that the horrible evil scourge of Islam is somehow a so-called Religion of Peace, morally equivalent to all true faith-based religions. Thus, in his fairy tale narrative, Muslims are morally equivalent to all non-Muslim unbelievers in the world and never mind the fact that Muslims have been the archenemies of all non-Muslim unbelievers in the world ever since that menace to all non-Muslim unbeliever societies first evolved approximately 1400 years ago.Hence, instead of acting swiftly to separate our two fully incompatible societies from one another completely, permanently, and forever and as common sense dictated in response to 9/11, that utterly unhinged loon, GWB, increased mass Muslim migration with all of its excess baggage and in which is really stealth demographic jihad to invade and infiltrate non-Muslim unbeliever countries in mass, by five-fold, and at the same time created the biggest federal boondoggle the world had ever seen when he created the gargantuan Department of Homeland Security to spy on all of us today.Then he declared an exceedingly fantasy-based War on Terror that was preordained and doomed to miserably fail no matter what since even before it was first launched because it was premised on the fairy-tale that the horrible evil scourge of Islam is somehow a so-called Religion of Peace, morally equivalent to all true faith-based religions.Hence, exactly like all things premise and based on a stupid stupid fairy tale, that incredibly fantasy-based so-called War on Terror has been miserably failing year after year to the tune already of over $8 trillion dollars and with no end in sight.Anyway, my biggest criticism of the movie is they could have at least found someone far better looking to play the part of Snowden's girlfriend to give us, the audience, something far better to look at during the movie."
" Just another biopic you do not need to see
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,5,"A troop of soldiers-to-be is quickly trudging through the woods, mindlessly humming something along the lines of the undying Mickey Mouse March, echoing so eerily and uncannily during the last shots of Full Metal Jacket. They march in concert, occasionally crawling through mud, being mercilessly yelled at, actively becoming a tiny cog in the boundless mechanism. One of these rookies is soon going to turn the world upside down; but for now he is just wearily inspecting x-ray of his fractured leg - there is surely so much to come. But, unfortunately, not for this movie.
The modern revolutionary, the inconspicuous face behind the Guy Fawkes mask, the public's key to the darkest government secrets, Edward Snowden is portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, who may have certainly caught your attention in Nolan's Inception as a smart-looking, sophisticated 'dream-catcher' and ""thought-snatcher"". Gordon-Lewitt also happens to bear a chilling resemblance to the modern swashbuckler and impersonates him well enough throughout the movie. However, this particular piece on cybersecurity, the fear of constantly being watched and the uneasiness of being disappointed in your beliefs and principles, is not convincing in the slightest and surely does not stand in the same line with many other works dedicated to Snowden's victories and hardships; Snowden (2016) seems artificial and downright tacky, especially when compared to true-to-life, realistic enough Citizenfour (2014).
The movie tries to tell the enchanting and enamoring story of how one single person can successfully fight against the terrifying machine. But I would be lying if I told you that this specific depiction has evoked any emotions in me, much less rage. Delectably tasteless, remarkably bleak and incredibly tiresome to follow: the plot is nothing less of a simple bore. The cinematographic style is likewise inconsistent and incomprehensible; some shots easily remind you of cheap music videos, while others try to express the character's feelings of perplexity and frustration, but succeed only in giving you an annoying headache. I did, however, recognize the barely visible influence of action-style filmmaking with the use of handheld cameras, that flourished so flamingly after the Danish Dogma 95 cinematic movement was formed and managed to stay in big cinema forever. You could imagine my surprise after learning that Anthony Dod Mantle himself, responsible for cinematography in Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire (2008), Trier's Dogville (2003) and yes, Antichrist (2009), partook in the creation of Snowden (2016) too.
This rushed biopic, called for some reason 'a thriller' as well, inexplicably reminds of The Imitation Game (2014); the same blue and gray coloring, the same learning environment, the same atmosphere of a genius being born. But if The Imitation Game masterfully crafts a portrait of mysterious and immensely gifted Alan Turing, Snowden (2016) surely does not do justice to the real-life whistleblower. The latter comes out to be plain and one-dimensional, as if unable to feel any real emotions. Everything that surrounds the main character - from the make-believe NSA facilities to Snowden's menacing tutor as well as CIA Deputy Director (that 1984-mocking scene of him peering right into Snowden's soul surely did make me chuckle) to his life-size figure of a girlfriend, the setting does not seem to be believable, not even remotely.
Along with its countless gags and goofs inappropriate for a good hacker movie, Snowden (2016) makes rather for a nice laugh and nap, rather than a proper insightful story of a man who has hacked the government. No revolutionary spirit, no protest, no fight and awareness. Just a poorly done retelling of a unique story, with no eye-catching cinematography and futuristic editing to add.5 suspiciously looking Rubik's cubes out of 10"
" Informative and entertaining
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,8,"A great movie for the general viewer. The movie crafts a character you can get behind, and follows his gradual disillusionment with the government of the United States. Overall, very entertaining and enlightening. Solid performance from Joseph Gordon Lewitt as well.
The fact that it was all based on a true story added to the allure. The movie had me constantly opening up wikipedia and reading up on the numerous scandals and transgressions."
" Couldn't get to grips with Joseph's voice
",2020-05-30 00:00:00,3,I found it trying to listen to the dialogue with Joseph as he sounded like he had a mouth full of peanut butter. I don't remember his voice being so hard to pick up. Also the subject matter irritates me as I'm very pro being spied on. It's for our own good and the people worried about being spied on are obviously up to no good otherwise why would you worry. So quite a tedious film for me. Sorry

" totally not my thing
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,6,"4 years after the hype around Snowden I decided to watch this flick. Maybe that's a wrong choice because after just over an hour I stopped watching it. I can understand that for some this flick was amazing sadly not for me.I don't know exactly why but I never really got into the movie. To much blah blah and technical stuff. For people in the IT worls this is maybe the movie to watch. But even if you are into spionage and stuff like that you really have to sit through it all to wait until things go wrong.But over an hour I quit. Totally not my cup of tea.

" REVEALING DARK SIDE OF THE INTERNET, A TRUE AMERICAN HERO !
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,9,"First of all I would like to appreciate Joseph as he portrayed excellently like the real Edward Snowden. Fantastic job done by him.We all live in this era of technology. Using social medias, chatting, booking flight tickets, using browsers, VPN etc. But the most terrifying matter is that what if someone tracking my internet world? Isn't that scary? What if I'm writing this review on the internet and someone already tapped it? There's no confidentiality, no privacy nothing! It's a universal true that we never agree to the terms and conditions that given by any operator or so. This is the dark part of the internet. Millions of people might be bugged by medias, operators, governments, group of industries. We're giving them data, sharing our digital footprints and digital advertisements shows up anywhere you're browsing. This is truly terrifying and scary.This is the dark side of our internet that we pay for. It's brave that Ed truly showed the world the hidden face. Brilliantly directed by Oliver Stone,"
" Serves well as a conduit to make you think...
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,7,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the title role, is recruited to work for the CIA and soon realises that there are plenty of ""Un-American"" activities going on that he decides to leak to the press. The ""Wikileaks"" story is amongst the best publicised in recent years so there is little latitude the film can take with the chronology or facts. What it does do, though, is create a character in Snowden that is both torn and decent; not just with the responsibilities he faces at work, but with the impact on his family and long-time girlfriend (here, a rather better than usual Shailene Woodley) when he decides to spill the beans. That said, JGL really has to hold this up by himself - Zachary Quinto is terrible and neither Nicholas Cage nor Rhys Ifans add much beyond their names to the depth of the story. Clearly, much of this is supposition but it is certainly a thought-provoking attempt to question what we might do with information that is quite so condemnatory of our own ""free"" governments, if it were to come into our possession; or, indeed - should we ever become faced with the evidence of the comprehensive extent of the monitoring sub-culture that this film suggests may well exist across all of our communities."
" Real and Entertaining
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,9,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt brings the heat on this film.I still remember the scene when Edward Snowden leaves the building with the needed data he wanted to expose the government m. My palms were sweating and it made me lean forward some more.The fact that this film is real is mind-boggling to me. It's a sort of documentary in and of itself too.Truly, truly great movie. It also shows the courage and strength of one individual who wore an invisible white hat to help others."
" JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH'S GLOBAL SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMS ( American A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,10,"Extraordinary exposure of US and UK intelligence and military forces where the guns no longer only point at the 'foreign enemy' but at the 'domestic enemy' i.e. the entire population of America, the United Kingdom, and the world in order to protect the global elites and power. Big Brother is here like we could never have imagined. A real eye opener of a movie and one where you have to pinch yourself from time to time to remind you, 'this is for real!' I think many many critics of the content, rather than the execution of this movie, have exposed themselves as either willful products of that propaganda machine or possibly of that machine."
" Best of JGL
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,10,"I am amazed, astonished , awed and shocked. This is by all means the best of JGL so far. And one of the best cult films. I highly and insistently recommend it."
" Watch for Shock Factor
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,6,The story telling was okay but the issues it brought up were mind blowing. Worth checking out.
" Learn security
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,9,"This movie perfectly shows how weak we are on the web. No matter how much do the corporations tell us about security they provide, it means nothing. Maybe new Utopia p2p network will give us a chance to stay anonymous, but only time will show that. It's really scary to realise that all the info we share even in the personal correspondence, is easily accessed by the 3rd parties.
After watching this movie, the only thing I wanted is to turn off all the devices and sit still. But it's impossible nowadays, too boring."
" Mind blowing!
",2020-01-30 00:00:00,9,Terrorism is just an excuse... every government finds it's way to control people
" Unnecessary, but good
",2020-01-05 00:00:00,6,"A kind of a unnecessary movie, because there is already a brilliant documentary 'Citizenfour' by Laura Poitras which tells the same story, but better. Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives a good performance though."
" One of the BEST in my eyes!
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,10,"It's Jan. 2020 and I could not find any theater showing this not-to-be-missed film. I have followed Edward Snowden's adventures from day one. Google ""Terminal F"" for a European documentary about Ed's escape from Hong Kong. Very good, also.So I rated it ""10"" because the story very much follows the historical facts. Julian Assange and Sarah Harrison's part in getting Ed out of Hong Kong was glossed over, but Terminal F covers that story well.Thank you, Oliver Stone!"
" The reviews in here are just bonkers
",2019-11-22 00:00:00,5,"Seriously, 9 or 10 out of 10 for this boring, write on your nose movie?"
" A great movie
",2019-10-20 00:00:00,9,"I am a great fan of Snowden, for me, he is a hero. So no surprise after ""Citizen 4"", I wanted also to see ""Snowden"". Well, I must admit I never expected for the movie to touch me so deeply. It was told in such a masterful way, that even though I know the story, I was practically enchanted by the plot. The voice of Joseph Gorden-Levitt, the manners, the looks, everything was so unbelievably realistic! I just cannot believe how well he did in this role. I still haven't read ""Permanent record"" so I'm not sure to what extent the movie is true to the reality, but from what I know, it seems very close. But what's more important - the movie really is a good movie. You feel immersed in all the details, the animations, and the suspense. It's surreal. It leaft me teary at the end, because you just realise the person it portrays is simply amazing. Edward Snowden is amazing!"
" Amazing
",2019-09-24 00:00:00,10,Amazing acting and an almost accurate depiction of a true hero. I dont usually give movies a 10 but I've noticed IMDb has a different rating platform than other sites so Its worthy on this particular masterpiece.

" Another great stone work
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,10,Gordon-Levitt was outstanding and Oliver stone served up another great film
" Ultimately conservative
",2019-06-12 00:00:00,5,"All it does is replacing nazism (nationalism in any case) with this so-called patriotism -like there is a difference. Its flaw is that it has a very old, very male, director. How can he not be that conservative? To be free you need to destroy the constitution first. I quote from ""Political thinking for the masses: way to freedom"": ""When you hear 'founding fathers', it can't end well. It only suggests a different kind of nationalism: 'patriotism' they call it. It's like LGBTQIetc. (ch. 5) in the place of binary identifications: it's still identities. Why care? Why care where you live, or about names? We're talking about 19th and 18th century: that was not freedom. Also, the 'ancient romans': you can't say that liberty (civilization) started there, and then evolved. As long as there were slaves (or simply no discursivity), it had nothing to do with liberty."""
" Snowden was a Hero of public
",2019-04-30 00:00:00,10,This was underrated Movie ... It has awesome content and i couldn't understand why people seems he is guilty.... He has done his job for people in USA which leaking illegal things of Government organization conducted to good for community ...... Just watch this and I've never felt the time is running! worth to watch..... Recommended !
" Great film as it's based on reality. Unnecessary sexual content
",2019-04-12 00:00:00,8,Great film but really spoilt by unnecessary and entirely unrelated sexual scene means I can't share it with friends.
" Nothing but stars for this
",2019-03-29 00:00:00,10,"Great movie, great message. Snowmen is an American hero! If only more people were ""woke"" to this instead of whatever Kim Kardashian has been up to."
" Lasts for more than 2 hours but not boring at any time
",2019-03-18 00:00:00,10,I was chocked that this moving was so interesting! And it seems that it is as close to truth as it can come. It is really good and thrilling storytelling but sticks to the real story.
" ""I haven't trusted anyone in years.""
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,8,"The only thing I know for sure after watching this film is that I don't know anything for sure. The only other time I was as conflicted about a real live event like Snowden's release of information about NSA surveillance was the uncovering of the Pentagon Papers during the Nixon era. That was supposed to jeopardize national security, but well after the fact, nothing really ever came of it. So even though the NSA was directed to clean up it's act, how do we know for sure? And now, we have Facebook under the gun for it's intrusion into the privacy of everyday Americans and the selling of information to any entity willing to pay for it.What I CAN say about the film is that it was very well done. With Oliver Stone at the helm though, you have one more added element to consider regarding how accurate everything portrayed in it is, and depending on your ideological viewpoint, whether Edward Snowden, here portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, was a first class traitor or not. Again, conflicted at the outset when this story broke, I did indeed regard Snowden a traitor for releasing classified information, but as time marches on, one has to consider that he might have done the country a service by exposing the methods used by the government to spy on it's citizens (pretty much the same way the goliath tech companies do it without any oversight, although that day of reckoning seems to be coming).So in this era of fake news and deeply divided partisanship, what do we really know? I'd like to think the movie was a fairly accurate portrayal of what occurred to convince Edward Snowden to do what he did, but with the spin doctors working overtime, I don't know that we'll ever find out. And I don't know If Snowden will ever clearly see the light of day again. This is a story that hasn't come to an end yet."
" true story

A real good movie!"
" Story of a rise to infamy
",2019-02-22 00:00:00,6,"This story about one of the most important whistleblower cases in American history is filmed in grand settings to match the scale of the revelations.
It's a film about great courage but fails on suspense with the revelations. It's a story about get risk but fails to be provoking. Credit mostly goes to Gordon-Levitt's performance which is well observed and restrained. But there was some serious miscasting too: Nicolas Cage as a CIA IT teacher and Rhys Ifans, unconvincing as a CIA mentor.
Some sequences felt misplaced, such as the 90s film style training exercises. A viewer can suspend their belief in a character amidst great disagreements in the real world, but push it too far and they begin to question what was left out. ""Snowden"" might have pushed too far on the brainiac narrative and hagiography whilst attempting to appeal to a maximum breadth of audience."
" every patriotic American should see this
",2019-02-03 00:00:00,10,"Finally a movie with a virtuous man who follows his heart to do what is right for the country he loves! It shocking how many people blindly trust big government and big corporations to gather private info on anyone they want on Earth, and trust always-on microphones in their homes."
" Big balls
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,7,Decent movie new very little about this story and it seems to me the guy did the right thing! Living a dream life in Hawaii with lots of money and chose to blow the whistle. Good on him I say can't say I would of had the balls.
" Decent Political Drama
",2019-01-24 00:00:00,6,"This dramatization of Edward Snowden's 2013 leak of classified NSA information is far from best movie ever, but far from the worst. The most notable aspect is that Joseph Gordon Levitt does a good job at portraying the controversial whistleblower. Levitt is a great actor, and this is one of his finest performances. He does exactly what any good movie, especially one about a real, living person should; it shows the audience how he got to his place, what his actions were, and why he did them. That way, the audience can relate to him, understand him, and make a more informed judgement on his actions. The rest of the cast is generally well acted, which is good. However, there are detracting elements. First off, this movie has possibly the most pointless sex scene I've ever seen. Pointless sex is one of my least favorite movie tropes. It seems like it was there just to reaffirm that the movie would be rated R. Second, it has really unnecessary cameos by presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton (bearing in mind this movie came out a month before the election), in which they both condemn Snowden's actions. It just felt forced. Therein lies one of the problems with the movie as a whole: unlike much of Oliver Stone's other stuff, it doesn't seem like it's trying as hard as the others to be controversial. Oliver Stone is known for his controversial content, and we've come to expect content that would start conversation, like Snowden did. This isn't exactly it. It feels more like a historical drama that a current political movie. Generally speaking, though, your views of Snowden as a person will reflect your views on this movie. If you think he did the right thing, you may like it. If you think he's a traitor, you probably won't. It's rather simple that way, but there's not much more to it."
" Annoying, boring film
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,3,"Sure, this film was a fast-paced drama. But at the same time it also was distorting the reality of what happened for something that ended up not having much of an impact at all, only leading to a few changed minds then people forgot about it all. All in all this movie is not worth anyone's time.But one paragraph is not, in and of itself, enough to grant this film a rating of 3 out of 10. I would say that Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a good role as Edward Snowden, and Shailene Woodley does the same as Lindsay Mills, Snowden's girlfriend. I guess after following this whole saga over the past few years and having Snowden become a celebrity and all, with the archive of his records recently deleted by The Intercept, this film seems relatively annoying and boring. The fact that Oliver Stone made this film is a damn shame, as he's made much better films in the past like Scarface (1983), Platoon (1986), and Wall Street (1987) to name a few.With that, my review of this film comes to a close."
" excellent movie
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,9,Its great movie. i dont know why people complain about this movie. its very goodi cant keep my eyes from screen.it mesmerising
" Interesting movie, and very well made
",2018-11-24 00:00:00,8,"Snowden's story is interesting and he made a huge sacrifice in order to get people know what was really going on. So that's why I wanted to see what kind of movie they had made about him.
And I liked the movie.The acting was good and the actor portrayed Snowden very well, and to me the overall feeling was realistic enough. I almost felt like I was a fly, who was able to follow the real thing while it went on. Even when I knew how the story goes, I still felt nervous, when it seemed at some points that Snowden might get caught.I think the plot went on very smoothly and this movie didn't feel like it was over 2 hours long. It captured your attention in the first five minutes and then you just couldn't take a break.It is not the best movie ever, but it doesn't have to be, because it tells a very important story and it tells it very well, and what is the great thing about this movie, is that it shows Snowden in a positive light (as it should be)."
" An Honest Review
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,1,"What happened to Oliver Stone? Once upon a time you could sit down and watch a film, and knew he was the director just by the cuts alone, not to mention the atmosphere and over-all look of the presentation.This doesn't look like an Oliver Stone film.The script sounds like a Stone film. The plot is certainly an Oliver Stone plot. The subject matter and how it's handled is totally Stone. But the film, well, it's an Oliver Stone film.The actors involved, well, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is certainly someone Stone would cast, but the long list of cameos of A and B grade stars comes down to a sprinkle and not a downpour like they used to.And the look of the film, where are the Stone cuts? It looks like anyone in Hollywood could have directed the script and made it into the movie that it is.The director doesn't leave his mark Snowden like he had on his earlier work. And, honestly, agree with his politics or not, the reason people go to see his movies is because he's directing them.Snowden doesn't feel like he really directed it, and you walk away feeling robbed because of it. The movie would have been great with anyone else, but, honestly, we didn't want to see this film made by anyone else, we wanted to see it made by Oliver Stone."
" Excellent
",2018-09-27 00:00:00,10,"Awesome work with the movie...very informative too 
I wish I watch this lot earlier"
" Poor storytelling crash an otherwise great effort
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,6,"Can you imagine amyone but Oliver Stone directing Snowden? No. Thats what makes the movie a tad disappointing. The film lacks the usual snarl from Stone who has taken on JFKs assassination, the Vietnam War, and the NFL smomg other topics. His best films have an energy, passion, and are out to make a point. Snowden has moments of passion and is very well acted. The story lets the film down. The choice Stone made to start with Snowden meeting with journalists to unveil his intel and then tell his story was creative. But so much of it falls flat. Its hard to connect with all the characters the film has. You almost wonder if a series would have been more appropriate for a full on bio Stone was telling."
" Who's the good guy and who's the bad guy
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,9,"Generally speaking we all love our country and are patriotic but this film really questions who is the good guy and who is the bad guy .This is a well documented true story so there's no spoilers here but what is great about Oliver Stone's movie is story behind the story - great storytelling about the background to how Ed Snowden got to be where he was and there was no doubting his patriotism right from the start but in the end the machine ( being the government ) like skynet turned on its owners and started to spy on those who were their ultimate paymasters without their authority without their knowledge and what he did by being a 'traitor' was an act of heroism depending upon how you feel a government should be allowed to go in the pursuit of knowledge about ordinary folk under the false pretence that it is in the name of national security , rather than an inability to keep one's hands out of the cookie jar . The film keeps your interest from start to finish and tells the story in a series of flashbacks starting from the meeting with the Guardian journalists in Hong Kong . You feel like your watching a Modern day Turin played by young Kevin Spacey lookalike . Rhys Ifans deserves praise for his acting without a trace of his trademark welsh accent . The love between his girlfriend and him with the added pressure of stress at work , his moral dilemma and failing health all adding to the drama . You are left hoping the real Ed Snowden is allowed to return to his home country and receive a fair trial or amnesty for you feel what he did was in the interests of the freedom of the people who in a free world should be able to trust their own government. Finally what it does do is show how prophetic the 1998 ( pre 9/11 ) film ENEMY OF THE STATE was where everything revealed in this film prophecized ! Pad.A 9/10"
" Dramatizing the documentary
",2018-08-17 00:00:00,7,"I am not one who, generally, likes to place any credence on the Hollywood excuse of dramatizing events to 'educate' the public. But, I am also one who is not inclined to watch Oliver Stone's genre of movies of any kind. This movie becomes an exception to that rule and only because of a chance encounter with it in a local library. Watching this movie compelled me to review the Snowden story. I tend to agree that this insistence that twisting the facts to make a movie more interesting is 'artistic license which often offends me. However, the results of this movie are that the people who are expected to diss it, for example, NSA overseers, do try to dismiss its value. I do intend, now, to watch Citizenfour, hoping that it will be truer to the truths behind the Snowden incident. What is disappointing is that this movie, with its astute references to the duty of every government employee, EVERYWHERE, to protect the truth and our freedoms over the motives of the entrenched elitists of our society, has NOT motivated many citizens on this planet to ask why the principles of the 1946 trials in Nuremberg are not legally protected in ANY OF our so-called 'democratic nations' on this planet. I am 66 years old, a former scientist who lost his job temporarily for daring to demand that the scientific truths I was responsible to be protected (in 1982). I paused from writing 'those books' which are my record as to why Snowden was indeed a principled man, no matter what the detractors say. Perhaps every viewer should watch this movie with the subtitles on and then ask why 'grand America', whose citizens seem to think like that 'fictional' NSA overseer, is NOT the protectorate of our freedoms and is, instead, silent to the very thing parts of this movie warn us about. In 2018, this movie, despite its shortcomings when it comes to dealing with the facts of the Snowden incident, should awaken ALL true 'democrats' to why a lawyer with constitutional training, Barack Obama, would summarily execute a distant murderer without trial (Osama bin Laden), justify this violation of international law and then become vindictive when the corruption of these partisan serving agencies is exposed by a whistleblower. This film is good at exposing the background dilemma which comes from making partisans, bound to their rich donors, above the law. Obama, this film reminds us, failed this planet and democracy so badly that we are left with a man like Trump, with a finger poised on dangerous weapons of mass destruction, 'for America'. It is sad that this movie seems to have failed us in opening up a debate which the subtitles do expose: when we suppress the freedoms that are compelled to allow criticism of those in positions of power, we do take this planet back to 1929. No matter what the lessons of Nuremberg are, which Oliver Stone appropriately draws into a movie which should compel greater citizen engagement in questioning all of this into 2018. Is it this movie which fails us or are we back to 1933 where journalists and others warned and the citizenry remained more interested in the theatre and movies? Don MacAlpine, Wolseley, Saskatchewan, Canada ... Live not in fear but in personal acknowledgement of the individual duty to protect the truth over self-serving interests of the powerfully positioned ..."
" Intriguing
",2018-08-15 00:00:00,6,Whether hero or villain is not settled after viewing this film but it does offer some context. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Melisa Leo do espelcially well in the acting department.
" There is no right or wrong in this movie
",2018-08-12 00:00:00,8,"He unveiled a thing that he thought isn't right but for the government, that act is a betrayal. Probably there is no right act or wrong act. All you have to do is to follow what you think is right."
" Good but with avoidable flaws
",2018-08-08 00:00:00,8,"First, I spent a career hunting people like Snowden, so I am definitely not a fan. But, this a generally really well written, told, and filmed story and it generated sympathy for Snowden as a story like this should. Where I fault the film is in stupid mistakes that could have been avoided with minimal research or fact checking. A prime example are all the basic training scenes where Snowden answers an Army Drill Sergeant by calling him sir. Absolute fail. Asking any of the vets at the any of the guilds (WGA, SAG, DGA, etc - including the craft services) about the use of ""sir"" in the various services would have cleared up this distracting mistake (an enlisted soldier is never called sir, while and enlisted Marine may be). There are many other factually inaccurate issues as well that only affect the story because they become a distraction. The distractions lower score of an otherwise really good film."
" Fantastic!
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,10,This movie was absolutly excellent! The only people that would rate this movie bad are liberals or anyone that doesnt agree with what he did because they probably work for the shady part of the government. The rubix cube scene was absolutly genius. I have paid to see this movie 3 times when it was in theater all with different people. Amazinf movie!!
" Traitor or patriot, Snowden's story remains relevant
",2018-07-22 00:00:00,7,"Oliver Stone's storied career as a director is well known to many. Usually finding inspiration in subject matter that's within the political realm, he has a way of telling stories that usually end up causing a side of the aisle to get annoyed.In 'Snowden,' we get a behind the scenes look at the shaping of the man who would go on to become one of this country's most infamous whistleblowers. While Edward Snowden is viewed by many as a traitor, and others as a patriot, it's clear there was a major transformation that happened to the former CIA agent as he experienced various events that gave him pause due to privacy concerns. We get to see this evolution, from a young man whose faith in government could not be shaken to a skeptic who went to great lengths to expose an intricate network of spy games.While Joseph Gordon-Levitt has proven to be a fairly versatile actor to date, it's clear his resemblance to Snowden helped him get the part. Gordon-Levitt does a good job capturing his dry, shy demeanor, coming across as being authentic. There are also noteworthy performances from Shailene Woodley as Snowden's girlfriend from the other side of the tracks, as well as supporting actors Melissa Leo and Zachary Quinto as the documentary filmmaker and investigative journalist duo who help Snowden tell his story to the world. In a dramatic thriller of this kind, these performances carry a lot of weight, and fortunately they are on point here.What Stone does well here is telling the story through a series of important events in Snowden's career that help setup the rationale for why he did what he did. Everything is laid out in a very linear manner, and it works well here. While 'Snowden' is not intended to be a 'Jason Bourne'-style spy thriller, it is entertaining and interesting all the same, and still as relevant today as it was five years ago when it actually happened."
" How accurate is this movie?
",2018-07-16 00:00:00,7,"When you look at a production you must always remember there are script writers and a director as well producers involved with the creation of the production.There are agendas and deadlines, as well, requirements for length, language, legal and other variables to take in to consideration.Names, places and times are changed. Scripts are written to fit a mold.While this movie presents the ideal of stopping a Big Brother government from spying on all the people and collecting information to be used at a later time against the public should you do something considered to be a threat to the political and religious nature of the government, it is still a movie.I thought the casting was very good, the script moved along smoothly. I enjoyed the cinematography. I enjoyed the ending.However, I do not believe Snowden is a patriot but I do not believe he is a terrorist either. He is a young man who was put in to a position of questioning his job and the desire for his government to spy on their own people.He had morals and ethics, which is more than I can say for any part of the American government for the last 100 years. He felt what was happening was wrong and that he needed to expose the truth.I do not believe what he did was wrong, I think he did it for righteous reasons, but he also harmed America and released information which set in motion another moment when America was weakened and put in to a position of international stress.It's a good movie, but it isn't perfect."
" Great!

" Our Eyes, Their WebSight.
",2018-05-27 00:00:00,7,"The problem is this; If you just make it publicly known that; ""Your information is being surveilled"", without really digging deep into the ramifications of such an invasion, the public won't care, much like the more recent Facebook scandal. What I'm trying to say is, news feel like just news, not reality. News feel like that 30 minutes with adverts in between, like a TV show.""Verizon is hacking into all your phone calls"" is interpreted by the public as; ""Sure, but not my phone calls"". I mean here we are, ""reviewing"" on IMDb without a care as to what is being tapped into.Films like Snowden and The Big Short, and and and, are important and more than just movies. Their topics are difficult to articulate perhaps, but, they transcend entertainment.As a film however, Snowden was sluggish at points, but I do feel it did put in a concerted effort to simplify as best as it could, the applications and repercussions of the missions and actions in play.This movie also kept unveiling some pretty serious star power I didn't know it had, and of that star presence, Zachary Quinto was the most quintessential.Some aspects in Snowden were hard to follow; ""All this effing intelligence jargon is hurting our brains"". That line was so appropriate, true (Hell, it even gave Ed himself a seizure, and they called it ""epilepsy"") and incredibly funny, that it showed me that Snowden was self aware, however, amidst all that jargon, I understood one thing as it was mentioned; Going to Hawaii was OBVIOUSLY a TERRIBLE idea, if the aim was for Ed to have, ""less stress""!!!Like I said, Snowden is one of those movies that, expose a truth that never really dies, no matter how much it's said that it has, and that is significant. And, in this movie, that story is illustrated quite efficiently, though a bit slow at times. 7/10."
" Rivetting
",2018-05-22 00:00:00,8,I thought this wouldn't make such an impact after Citizen four but this film was able to show many things that were quite vague in the documentary while omitting much that is in it. As a biopic the film struggles in creating the situations in Snowden's life but I believe this works the best as a double bill with the documentary. Perfectly showing the true story directly through the whistle-blower and showing the back stories that lead to this situation. America's thirst to stay as the superpower is quite something that they want the people to stand up for the gun laws instead of problems such as these.Joseph Gorden Levitt never ceases to surprise and Oliver Stone knows how to deal with controversial subjects
" Clueless grandpa directs hacker film. Snowden deserves better than this.
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,1,"Oliver Stone is simply trying to tell a story about subject can't relate or understand. The beginning is directly from Citizenfour but with actors. The dramatization of training in the CIA is full of melodramatic monologues. When you don't understand something, you treat it as magic and Stone is doing just that. Stone don't understand what Snowden's world is and as a result he can't make the movie work. Oliver Stone was the director of the 80's and 90's Salvador, Platoon and Wall Street, Born on the Fourth of July, The Doors, JFK, Natural Born Killers were based on something he knew or could understand.Watch the documentary Citizenfour instead."

",2018-05-16 00:00:00,7,"Edward Snowden works for various clandestine elements of the US government machinery. While writing software to shut down Chinese hackers, he discovers that the US is carrying out illegal surveillance over billions of emails from US citizens. What should he do?Well, we know what he did, he blew the whistle. And despite the fact that he was proved right, and measures were taken to stop the illegal collection of uncountable emails, his copybook is so comprehensively blotted that he remains an exile in Moscow.Oliver Stone takes things very seriously indeed, and this can sometimes result in two things: one, his personal agenda overtakes the story he is telling and, two, the issues he is raising overpower the entertainment value of the movie. Both these flaws are at work here.Stone clearly regards Snowden as a hero, a martyr. Maybe this is justified, but it is a little difficult to tell because Stone only ever gives us one side of the picture.And, unforgiveably, the movie is somewhat on the dull side. Snowden's story is interesting and has built in suspense but, at 134 minutes, the telling of it drags noticeably at times.Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives a good performance as Snowden, as does Shailene Woodley as his girlfriend Lindsay Mills. For me, the best performance was Rhys Ifans, almost unrecognisable as CIA Deputy Director Corbin O'Brian.I came out of this better informed I think, though it was difficult to tell how much of what I was being fed was fact, and how much was Stone's overheated agenda at work. But I can't honestly say I was entertained that much."
" One of the most important films of modern times
",2018-05-09 00:00:00,8,"Irrespective of what one may think of the acting and directing (which I found just fine), the actual story sits alongside ""Inside Job"" and ""Sicko"" as revelations as to how the American way has been subverted in the name of unprincipled profit and corporate world domination. It is hardly surprising that Russia, China and even allies are pulling back from global partnership as they have realised how the USA's leaders cannot be trusted as partners, since their goal is US supremacy and control, vital agreements are discarded from one presidency to the next and cooperation is only interesting as long as it yields advantages (we still remember how the leader of a major nation who acted like that led us all into a global war).
It is tragic, because the ordinary American people are not like that and have always been noted for their willingness to help those in need, at home and abroad. Whistleblowers like Snowden are essential to a healthy society and it is disgraceful that in the USA they fear for their freedom, their jobs, economic well-being and even their lives. 
Watch this film to see how a proud American had his faith that his country's practices matched its espoused values eroded by what he saw in his privileged position within the intelligence community. And be proud of him that once it went too far he did something about it, even knowing that it would be at considerable personal cost."
" Great.
",2018-03-12 00:00:00,9,"Just great. Love the plot, visuals, cinematography, casts, acting."
" Snowden is a competently made biopic that addresses immediate issues in today's world.
",2018-03-09 00:00:00,7,"Edward Snowden. Some may view him as a criminal for breaking the law and leaking secure information from the NSA, however the film took a more patriotic approach and portrayed him as a hero for revealing this information to the world. It's a very tricky subject. Did he have any right to go against his government and be considered a traitor? Perhaps, if it meant that the public knew that they were being spied on. Privacy is such an integral part of our interconnected lives, so my views may suggest that I agree with Snowden's actions...but as a self-proclaimed critic I shall remain unbiased. As a film, I thought Snowden was actually pretty well executed. Oliver Stone did a great job at balancing Edward's private life with his career which definitely made him more relatable as a character. I really appreciated the technical jargon, as a computer programmer I understood it all and felt like saying ""Yes! I could easily become a hacker!"". Alas, writing code in film is much easier than in reality...so my genius thoughts were shot down immediately. What really took me by surprise was the cast. ALOT of big names here that I wasn't expecting to see. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was perfect casting, took me a while to tune into his voice imitation of Snowden but I thought he was excellent. Rhys Ifans, Tom Wilkinson, Melissa Leo, Timothy Olyphant, Shailene Woodley (who's chemistry with Gordon-Levitt was slightly underdeveloped) and the one...the only...Nicolas Cage. Yes, stop what you are doing and gasp in revelatory excitement...Cagey boy, is in a good film. I thought the dramatic moments were tense, the plot was educational...all the elements for perfection were there. I just felt the structure was too basic and familiar. Nothing extraordinarily groundbreaking. It's a functional biopic and it succeeds in what it sets out to do. I couldn't help but think this was similar to The Fifth Estate...just better. Overall, an enjoyable basic biopic that addresses an important issue."
" Great lowdown
",2018-03-04 00:00:00,8,"How Snowden came to be one of the important whistle-blowers of the world. After Manning, which revealed crimes the US military did, Snowden chose to flee and stay free. This film holds a neat and simplified narrative that explains the work and the revelations. The fact that the US has secrets courts to obtain permissions so that no one is aware is a huge trampling of freedom. Frankly, how can they expect us to believe in their democratie if the public is never informed of the actions of their government."

" Leaks
",2018-02-05 00:00:00,6,Pretty decent movie. Somehow missed this one the last few years but figured I would give it a try when I saw it on HBO.It's interesting seeing Snowden's background. It was also really creepy to see the example of the technology that the NSA was using to spy on American's and those abroad. I had previously watched Citizenfour so I had known about the meeting in Hong Kong and about the leak of information.. However I will say he definitely was glamorized and made to look like the victim in this movie. It was made to be seen from his side.
" A superb and thrilling biography
",2018-01-28 00:00:00,10,"A young man by the name of Edward Snowden is about to tell the world deep secrets from his past jobs, when he secretly worked for CIA and NSA. Together with three experienced journalists, he's about to tell the story of his life, how it all started and how it managed to get so wrong in the end.This movie, inspired from real facts, depicts the power of the American intelligence agencies which were spying on people in order to protect them from terrorist attacks, but it all got much deeper than intended. It's a very interesting movie, captivating I must say, which describes in detail the life of Snowden and what happened behind the scenes of the notorious intelligence agencies, who's programs were doing a lot more than invading privacy.It's very well presented, alternating present and past events, very well played by its cast and very well executed overall. A must see for everyone, especially for IT fans."
" Should be compulsory viewing in all educational establishments all over the 'free' world
",2018-01-05 00:00:00,9,"Like most folks, I probably picked up on the Snowden papers through the press and media. Assuming you don't believe it was 'fake' news, you'll already have a good idea of the story.What's verging on the unbelievable is that there were calls for 'his head' among US politicians (although, as we now absolutely know for certain, election to office is no guarantee of intelligence, reasonableness, open-mindedness or sanity). The NSA et al think they are powers above all else. And that's such a dangerous stance. It's held by a few scared egotists at the upper echelons of power and the fear and paranoia pervade down through the entire system.We need people like Snowden and other whistle blowers to hold the 'government' to account and it's impossible to know how much of a sacrifice such people have made in order to attempt to secure the freedom and liberty - such as it is - for the rest of us. It's when good men do nothing that evil prospers.And so to the movie :-) It's absolutely excellent, from the acting to the direction, editing, production, music - the lot! If you knew nothing about Snowden you'd approach it as a political thriller and you'd be engrossed. Even knowing the history, the movie and story move along at a cracking pace. It never drags, it's never dull or boring; it's always engrossing. Snowden's little speeches are eloquent throughout and it's impossible to come away from the movie without knowing that this guy did the right thing.It's a thriller with a message. If not for people like Snowden we'd be on our way to 1984. Orwell may have got the year wrong but the prospect of Big brother looms larger now than it has ever done.Watch it. Enjoy it. Learn. Remember."

Edward Snowden Uncoveres the beginning of a ""Dragnet on the whole world."" The Film is Anchored by Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Smooth and In-Skin Performance while Surrounded by Responsibilities that are so Severe His Epilepsy Emerges as He is on a Trajectory that can't be Stopped.The Enormity of the Consequences of both Edward Snowden and the Governmental Agencies ""Spying"" on ""Everyone"" is what is at Stake in this ""Real-Life"" Story that Modernity has Yet to get a Handle.Snowden's Story is Now Well Known and the Director goes Deep in the Psyche of ""Snowden"" and His Personal Life as it Relates to the Stresses and Consequences of His Job as a Government Contractor, CIA and NSA Analyst.The Movie can be real Creepy at times, especially when He is with His Mentor Corbin (Rhys Ifans). It is a Suspenseful Film despite the Foregone Knowledge of Events. Oliver Stone, although He is in Unobtrusive Mode, makes much use of Camera Angles and Techniques that are Subtle but Impressive throughout the Film. It's Visceral Effect is Nowhere Near the Director's other well known Films and probably would have been Ill Advised Anyway. As it Stands it is a Compelling, Cohesive (despite the tech stuff) and Completely Satisfying, considering the Scope of the Subject and the United States Government/Citizens Implications of the Still Ongoing and Very Real Daily Headlines."
" Too dishonest. Accuracy matters in a movie like this.
",2017-10-16 00:00:00,2,"For a controversial subject like Snowden it is important that the movie be at least moderately accurate. This movie will probably be how many viewers form their basic understanding of what happened - and that would be a great shame. If you want to know the real story, check out Citizenfour which is a documentary and makes an attempt to be honest."
" Rhys Ifans pretty much owns this movie
",2017-10-13 00:00:00,7,"Not Oliver Stone's best work, but nicely paced. JGL is OK but has failed to capture how enigmatic Edward Snowden actually is (as seen in Laura poitras' Citiznfour). Let's just jump straight to Rhys Ifans portrayal of CIA mentor Corbin O'Brian. Mesmerising, everything else fades into the background whenever he's on screen. I'll be absolutely gobsmacked if he's not cast as the supervillain in the next Bond movie."
" A Masterfully-Crafted Fairytale
",2017-09-16 00:00:00,7,"Oliver Stone's latest film, Snowden, a biopic about NSA whistle blower Edward Snowden, is an effective piece of propaganda. It's nearly flawless as a film in terms of acting, editing, pacing, and dialog, but lacks the depth usually given to such a controversial subject.First, here's what Snowden gets right. Every actor and actress in this movie is on point. Every character feels genuine. Nicolas Cage, in top form, even makes a cameo as Hank Forrester, a (fictional) disillusioned CIA instructor. Shailene Woodley is perfect as Lindsay Mills, a free spirited, liberal photographer Snowden falls in love with.One of the advantages of portraying a living person is you are able to study their mannerisms, tone, and expressions. Joseph Gordon-Levitt studied his subject well. Levitt, as Snowden, narrates throughout the entire film, as he is telling his story to a group of journalists, but the dialog is tight and the narration never gets bogged down in needless exposition.Snowden is well-crafted. In one particularly memorable scene, Corbin O'Brian, Snowden's fictional CIA handler, takes Snowden hunting and they discuss his career's future. The natural scene, the birds, hounds, metal and wooden shotguns, a hunting lodge, are perfectly juxtaposed against their conversation about cyberspace, computer network defense, and foreign enemies.It was a conversation Oliver Stone could have easily set in a fast paced room with wires, computer monitors, servers, and shadowy figures typing furiously at keyboards, but instead he chose to ground these abstract concepts in a stark, low-tech, almost serene environment.The film's visual authenticity is also its greatest weakness: because Snowden is almost entirely fictional. It is a fairy tale meant to portray Edward Snowden as a reluctant hero who is compelled to speak out against an out-of-control national security state, explicitly compared in one scene with Nazi Germany.For me, the film raised red flags in the very beginning when in basic training Snowden calls his drill sergeant ""Sir."" Soldiers in the U.S. Army do not call drill sergeants ""Sir."" You may think this is nitpicking, but if Oliver Stone is willing to fudge this minor detail for the sake of convention, or because it's what the audience expects to hear, what other facts is he willing to fudge for the sake of the story? Quite a bit, as it turns out. Some characters and situations are simply made up. Oliver Stone portrays Snowden as a genius and a rising star in the intelligence community, which jives with his own inflated image of himself. Snowden reportedly lied on his resume, saying he attended Johns Hopkins University, a Tokyo campus of the University of Maryland, and the University of Liverpool in Britain.In fact, Johns Hopkins has no record of him attending classes there, he attended one summer semester at the University of Maryland, and registered for but did not attend classes at the University of Liverpool. This inflated sense of accomplishment is reflected in the film–not as a personality flaw, but as undisputed truth.Contrast Snowden with the 2013 thriller about Julian Assange and Wikileaks, The Fifth Estate, and this one-sided portrayal becomes even more obvious. The Fifth Estate portrayed Julian Assange as a complex figure–someone who believed he was acting for the greater good but whose personal flaws cast a shadow over his actions.Snowden only shows one side of the story–as told by Snowden himself. Therefore, the audience is never led to question Snowden's version of events. In my opinion, this takes away from what otherwise would be a compelling film about current events."
" The kid did it
",2017-09-12 00:00:00,8,"This is a biopic of Edward Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) covering the years from 2004-2013 told as a flashback with some narration. The film shows his training, the fact he didn't finish high school, his time with the CIA, and then using the ""intelligence revolving door"" as a contractor. The film also concentrates on his relationship with the liberal leaning Lindsey Mills (Shailene Woodley) who appears to be an influence on his decision to be a ""martyr"".We see the development of Snowden's ideology as he witnesses entrapment, endangerment, blackmail, and killing of suspect terrorist with little to no over site. But what really set him off was the idea of the NSA can see Lindsey's tatas and American privacy was not a FISA court issue.This is an Oliver Stone film so the slant should go without saying, although the issue of government spying transcends most politics here and across the world. Stone creates fictional characters and relationships to weave his tale in a more concise, entertaining, and informative manner. These ""nuances"" (sometimes known as lies) need to be overlooked to enjoy a Stone film, which is about theme. This one raises the debate of freedom vs security, but not as entertainingly as ""A Few Good Men."" Did Snowden expose our intelligence gathering ability and damage our security? Has anything really changed? How would we know? Personally if I had a high paying job in paradise with Shailene Woodley demanding I spend more time with her...I might put off martyrdom for a while as I created a nest egg in an offshore numbered account.Nicolas Cage haters can breathe easy that he has only a small role.Guide: F-word. 1 sex scene. Brief computer screen nudity."
" informative
",2017-08-31 00:00:00,6,"It's 2013. Edward Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is holed up with Glenn Greenwald (Zachary Quinto) and Laura Poitras (Melissa Leo) in a HongKong hotel room. They convince Guardian editor Ewen MacAskill (Tom Wilkinson) to print sensitive documents stolen by Snowden that implicates the US government in the widespread spying on the American public. Snowden was discharged from the military for medical reasons. He was an Ayn Rand loving Republican who served in the CIA. The highly skilled programmer has a long winding successful career but the unchecked intrusion starts to concern him. His stress affects his relationship with liberal girlfriend Lindsay Mills (Shailene Woodley). Eventually, he copied the files and smuggled them out of NSA.There are some good information but Oliver Stone fails to make me root for Snowden no matter how hard he tries. And he tries very hard. JGL creates a naive true-believer who grows to hate the corruption of his work. Obviously, Stone has a point of view and is pushing a narrative from Snowden's side. I don't have a problem with that but he has to recruit my sympathies. In the end, a couple of his arguments rang hollow. JGL's mimicry of Snowden does not help. He has a flat speaking voice with some minor autistic tendencies. It's not like the general public knows his voice so it's not really necessary. The information is good but public affairs have overtaken his story. It's almost quaint at this point."
" Snowden Will Make You Think
",2017-08-22 00:00:00,8,"I don't usually have a great deal of respect for Stone's movies but Snowden is another matter. Seems maybe Stone has matured as a movie maker and not showing off as much as some earlier works suggest. This story gives us good reason to think far more about our leaders and the power of current high tech surveillance. It's to be hoped Snowden's motives were as well intended and idealistically slanted towards concerns for the general populace as we are being shown. If so, I salute him and Stone for this work. Interesting performances, great use of fine photographic technique and a thoughtful music score are a plus for this, at times unsettling movie. The Obama administration, as many of us knew, have much to explain and make amends for. Perhaps the reason this movie was not as popular as expected is that there have been many similarly themed works over the past several years that just may have come out too close to each other. On top of this, the dumbing down of some audiences with comic book type blockbusters never helps intelligent fare to gain strong circulation. As people learn more about these situations, I imagine this movie will benefit from more recognition. Recommended for thinking folk. Language is typical of other Stone works but the original, based on fact story, helps make up for some of it."
" Average watch but not that surprising! 5/10
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,5,"Review: I wasn't that impressed with this movie, because I found it quite boring after a while, and most of the information throughout the film, wasn't that surprising. I've always known that Big Brother is watching every move that we make but after watching this film, I appalled with how far the government actually went. Edward Snowden, played by Joseph Gordon- Levitt, damages his legs whilst trying to join the army, so he joins the CIA's hacking department to serve his country. After a couple of dodgy missions, he leaves the CIA and lives a quiet life with his girlfriend, Lindsay Mills (Shailene Woodley) but he soon returns to the CIA, and he soon realises that the government have gone to far with there methods to spy on people. With the pressure of his job taking its toll on his relationship, he decides to tell the press about the governments undercover methods, knowing that he will be sent to jail. With the CIA on his tail, he manages to give the press all of the information he has gathered over the years, and when it gets broadcasted, he flees to Russia, we're they have given him a 3 year pass to stay in there country. Its quite an intense movie, which will make you think twice about using electrical devices but from an entertainment point of view, I found it quite boring after a while. The whole cast put in an average performance, and the whole back and forth in time concept, spoilt the flow of the movie. Most of the technical jargon went straight over my head, and the love story lacked emotion and detail but it's still worth a watch, just to see how deep the American government pry into the publics private life. Average!Round-Up: This movie was directed by Oliver Stone, 70, who has brought you movies like the Hand in 1981, Salvador, Platoon, Wall Street, Talk Radio, Born On The Fourth Of July, The Doors, JFK, Heaven & Earth, Natural Born Killers, Nixon, U Turn, Any Given Sunday, Comandante, Alexander, World Trade Center, W., South Of The Border, Wall Street II and Savages. It certainly is an impressive filmography, and the fact that he wrote Scarface, Year of the Dragon and Midnight Express, really does make him one of the top filmmakers in Hollywood. He is one for sticking to the facts, so I'm not surprised with the outcome of this movie. Being an American, he was brave to touch on a subject which goes against the government but I think the main problem is that it's not surprising that they are so corrupt. Anyway, is OK when you first watch it but I can't see people watching it twice.Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $37.2millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their biography/thriller/dramas, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Melissa Leo, Zachary Quinto, Rhys Ifans, Nicolas Cage, Shailene Woodley, Tom Wilkinson, Joely Richardson, Timothy Olyphant, Scott Eastwood and Ben Chaplin. 5/10"
" Music score
",2017-08-12 00:00:00,8,"I liked the movie. However, I would like to comment on an omission in the music credits in this film. The film's composer neglected to give credit to Hubert Parry for his song ""Jerusalem"". The score features the theme to Parry's song prominently, but gives him no credit. Not only is the melody featured prominently, but the rest of the score uses variations of the melody and harmonics of Parry's music. I waited to see the end credits. Everyone is given credit down to the caterers, but there is no mention Parry. Just thought I should point this out."
" A compelling watch that left me wanting more and more.
",2017-08-08 00:00:00,9,"Well, I'm surprised. When I went to watch 'Snowden' I cant say I was expecting much, I expected it to be average at most, boy was I wrong. From the very first scene I found myself glued to the screen with vast amounts of interesting information, facts and fantastic acting and story line all spilling out at once. Some reviews I had read beforehand seemed to state that the title was a little slow moving in parts, I cannot say I agree at all. I think, personally, if you commit yourself to the film and set all electronics and distractions aside, which I do, then you will not be able to take your eyes of the screen. There is no unnecessary scenes as such, each one has reason behind it and valuable information to keep your interest for the entire two hour running time. Its hard to believe some of the software that the NSA, CIA etc have at their fingertips and its hard to believe that this movie is based of solid facts. Some scenes will leave you in shock, trust me on that one. As for the acting? Oscar Worthy. I find the actors get into character very very well and all credit to the star of the show, Joesph Gordon-Levitt, he does a fantastic job playing Snowden. To summarise, this was a fantastic movie, one of the best I have watched in a long time and I certainly recommend it to those who have interest in current affairs and politics etc. Now this doesn't mean its a 'strictly political film', because its not. There is a fine balance between politics, drama and pure thrillerness, excuse my made up word lol. Whether or not you believe what Snowden done was Patriotic or whether you believe he is a traitor is entirely up to you. Me? Well I think the guy has a huge set of B***s to do what he done. But don't let your personal opinion get in the way of you watching this title, because trust me its worth watching. Enjoy!"
" For a certain Propaganda audience
",2017-07-20 00:00:00,7,"These type of recent true event propaganda 'questioning the government' based drama films have a very specific audience and won't be liked by most. It does require full attention to detail and most notable a certain interest in the subject matter. For those not very familiar with this news outlet upon the real story, may not be too interested. Having not been too familiar with the details of the actual story oneself, expectations weren't too high since I did not know much what to expect.Snowden is a well crafted, directed and acted film. Joseph Gordon- Levitt is a star in his portrayal of Snowden as he makes the character more likable than he should be (which is a good thing). Shailene Woodley is also quite good in her role as Snowden's preposterous girlfriend. The film isn't as gripping or suspenseful as it could have been but it is still quite intriguing and entertaining as a whole. Though this film may be considered quite a disappointment, in terms of box office success and critical acclaim. It very well felt like a blatant Oscar bait film and it received no love from the Acadamy. The film was also a box office flop, only making $37 million worldwide on a $40 million budget, not too surprising considering this isn't a film which would do well in foreign markets, and since the reviews weren't that positive it was more than likely to flop. Another thing which hurt the film was it being rated R. They easily could have and should have toned it down for a PG-13 rating. With only one sex scene (which didn't show much) and a bit too many F-bombs, it wasn't as needed, which I think hurt it's box office. If the Social Network was able to get away with a PG-13 rating, Snowden should have been too. As being compared to the Social Network, Snowden isn't on that level, and is quite the disappointment. Though Snowden does make one think about real security in the end. Passable film but also forgettable."
" Not Stones best work
",2017-07-08 00:00:00,3,"The acting performances were skilled. I do not agree that this was well directed. The cinematography was flawed at best and continuity issues ran rampant. A few scenes left one thinking Stone was either asleep at the wheel or not present in post production.There's more than one view about Ed Snowden and his actions while working for US intelligence. Stone not only portrays only one view but offers no detail about alternative opinions or possibilities. The simple alternative labels Snowden a traitor. Stone fails to explore this. The assembly order of the ""facts"" leaves the viewer with little to work with other than Snowden's version of events and Stones biased portrayal.Given the release date of this movie, Stone had the opportunity to explore more recent findings that Snowden is now in league with Russia and handsomely under their employ. Although treason need not be at play, the principal of inevitable disclosure represents a compromise to both the NSA and CIA. How this can occur, the effect on US National security is far more compelling than the simpleton's portrayal of a hacker patriot whistle blower.I know it's too much to expect Oliver Stone would deliver a balanced perspective. In this case, the ax he's grinding is as dull as he."
" interesting political drama
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,6,"This movie is about the famous spy, Edward Snowden, whom now lives in exile in Moscow. The movie starts from the beginning of his career when an injury caused him to get into the computer side of the CIA. He creates programs that spy on people around the world including America. The government can tap into emails, phone calls, anything online gathering data. Problem is the government was doing this without just cause or a court order. And eventually he begins to feel some guilt about it. So, he steals some files that prove the spying and he gives them to the media. And the USA labels him a traitor, but others say he is a whistleblower and should not face criminal charges. The movie ends with him being given asylum in Russia and it says his long time girlfriend moved there.FINAL VERDICT: Good story, asks the question does the government have the right to spy on anyone without just cause? Worth a viewing."
" Riveting
",2017-06-21 00:00:00,9,"Oliver Stone knows how to make good movies. And ""Snowden"" is a good movie. From start to finish the film suggests a political thriller, comparable to ""All The President's Men"". With an overall tone of suspense and intrigue, the underlying theme here expresses the clash between citizen privacy and government spying by means of technology in the name of national security.Of course Edward Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is ""just"" a 29 year old computer geek who wears casual clothes and a backpack. How could he be a threat to the government? Well, in addition to being smart and having a conscience he happens to be in a position that allows access to sensitive computer information. He doesn't like what he sees; and he takes action.Ed Snowden comes across as innocent, naïve, and introverted. His girlfriend has an influence on him, and gradually changes his political point of view in a way that motivates his extreme actions.The script is well written except for the continual use of flashbacks, which would normally render a jerky plot. Yet, the editing is so polished that the plot flows fairly well despite the flashbacks. Background music generally is somber and serious. Editing is terrific. Casting and acting are fine. At first I had qualms about the casting of Gordon-Levitt, based on movies of his I have seen. But here he gives a surprisingly effective performance in the title role.Cinematography is acceptable, but I could have wished for more realistic production design. Computer control rooms and panels look a bit too futuristic in a Star Wars sense, for American government facilities.""Snowden"" conveys a mood of justified paranoia. It reminds me of the film ""Silkwood"", wherein an ordinary person takes on a powerful institution. This underlying theme is almost always potent in the right directorial hands. Consistent with his past films, Oliver Stone has made a riveting, timely, and potent film."
" Breaking through the other side

With all the miss-understandings going on, you don't even have to be drunk to really dig a grave for yourself. But this is about a man who went out of his way to tell us all what governments are doing (spying on us that is).Now did we learn anything about it? Did the majority crave for change? Will this all become normal in the future? It's hard to say, this is still very close to when it happened and you better believe there is monitoring going on. Oliver Stone does a good job with this account of true events that occurred one way or another. It's suspenseful from beginning to end, as it should be.

" Watch this movie if you can excuse your views on the man
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,7,"'SNOWDEN' was directed by Oliver Stone and stars Joseph Gordon- Levitt, Shailene Woodly and Melissa Leo. It is the incredible true story of how one man(Edward Snowden/Joseph Gordon Levitt) changed the face of surveillance and really how we deal with privacy and the government today.​ It's really impossible to review this movie without some form of bias. I for one see Edward Snowden as a hero and respect him fully for what he did for his country. Due to the heavily divided views on what Snowden did, it's hard to watch this movie(with any level of insight) in a completely fair and just manner in which you don't take the director's clear view into account. That said, I will definitely say that the majority of people who see this movie will enjoy seeing it. If you have a very avid opinion against the view represented here, you will probably not enjoy it unless you can put all that aside. If you can separate your views and focus on the actual movie itself, you'll be in for a mixed bag of everything.The story, for starters, is competently told and, from my knowledge, tells it in a mostly honest way. That said, there are many moments in the film were they try to add tension but it just doesn't work and feels no manipulated and forced. If all them things did happen then I'm sorry but unless I'm proved otherwise, the tension in this movie was very contrived. I also feel like they kind of glossed over what he actually did in the movie. Like it or not, he changed the entire world and they just kind of glide past the impact with a minute tribute.Next, the acting. Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a pretty good job as Edward Snowden and I understand the burden of representing someone who is A) Still Alive and B) changed the entire world as we know it. Shaillene Woodley was fine as Lindsay Mills. I can't say that any of the acting was sub-par just that some characters were underdeveloped and really should have earned more screen time.On a technical level, the movie movie is pretty solid. The cinematography is mostly fine with a few editing choices and rapid camera movements that I thought were out of place and didn't work for the rest of the film. In conclusion, this movie has pretty good drama and is entertaining if you can looking past all political opinions. If you can do that, I recommend it.7/10"
" One of Those Movies that I Really Enjoyed but was Just a Little Too Slow to Fully Enjoy
",2017-05-11 00:00:00,7,"Snowden follows Edward Snowden as he works for various groups where he handles classified information, when he learns that the government can and is watching just about everyone without them knowing, so he decides to leak the information. For starters, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is pretty great here. The performance he gives is authentic but still intelligent. He isn't just your generic tech nerd character, he has a personality, and his performance really shows that. Shailene Woodley does a great job as well, though she isn't given quite as much as Gordon-Levitt to work with. The rest of the cast is solid, but they don't get much better than these two. The writing here is painstakingly thorough. When I say that, it's both a good and a bad thing. On the bright side, the plot and characters are very well fleshed out. And something I loved was that you didn't have to be incredibly smart to understand a lot of the dialogue. The characters didn't use language that was heavily technology-based, so I actually understood the vast majority of the story. The plot wasn't lost in the language, and for a movie like this one that is certainly a welcome aspect of it. As a result of the thorough writing the characters were fairly well fleshed out, adding another level of depth to the movie. When there were tense moments they were actually tense. When something important happened there was weight. I actually cared about the characters. On the down side, however, the writing was so thorough that the movie became somewhat slow. It's one of those movies that you really like or find interesting, but it's just a tad too slow to fully enjoy. I feel like a bit of time could've been shaved off and it would've largely remained the same while still being thorough. Overall I really enjoyed Snowden. While it was slow almost all throughout, it was thorough and well performed. In the end I would recommend this movie."
" Rather Boring Portrayal of an Important Issue
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,3,"Don't try to use this movie to educate yourself about the Edward Snowden story. You're basically getting the director's slanted interpretation. A documentary on him, how he did it, and why would be much better for that purpose. Taken as pure entertainment, I found the movie boring. The only suspense is when he is copying files, might be noticed, and, when done, drops the SD card on the carpet. Gordon-Levitt's portrayal is flat and there's no chemistry between him and Melissa Leo (his girlfriend). Again, watch a documentary to hopefully get a more-balanced portrayal of the Snowden story and look elsewhere for internet hacking entertainment."
" A strangely unexciting affair with a terrific turn by Gordon Levitt
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,6,"A fascinating example of a modern day whistle-blower, Edward Snowden makes for an intriguing and engaging subject matter, watch the Academy Award winning documentary Citizenfour for proof of this, but politically charged director Oliver Stone's film about the NSA contractor and computer genius, turned America's most wanted is a strangely unexciting affair.Once hyped up as a potential Oscar contender, Stone's topical film seemingly struggles to nail down how to make this story truly tick and at 130 minutes in length, Stone's largely talk-heavy expose of Snowden's career and eventual whistleblowing (told largely via hotel room scenes that dominated Citizenfour) doesn't seem entirely comfortable with how it's going to engage its viewers, despite the nature of its story and a terrific turn by Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Snowden.After the misguided The Walk, it's refreshing to see Levitt once more showcase his considerable acting chops as Snowden. Nailing Snowden's demeanour and distinct voice, Levitt's turn helps elevate Snowden above where it may've laid without him and had the film found it's groove and the reception for it became stronger, it's possible it would've been a turn the recent awards season may've paid attention to.Levitt is a clear standout in the acting stakes here as other big names like Shailene Woodley, Nicolas Cage and Timothy Olyphant get stung with rather forgettable supporting turns.At times Snowden appears to be getting to convoluted or talk heavy for its own good but there's an undeniable quality sheen to the film that showcases this big budget production had the tools at its disposal to become one of 2016's most polished and interesting dramas.Ed Snowden's story is a story deserving to be told and Stone has a clear affection for what the once proud American did for his country, it's not often a story like this displays such a clearly identifiable reasoning behind someone's potentially questionable actions.Failing to ignite the public's interest or the affection of critics, Snowden may not be particularly memorable viewing but there's enough here, including a great final segment and a standout Gordon-Levitt turn to suggest that Stone's disappointing last decade or so behind camera is taking a turn for the better, even if Snowden wasn't the film he and many others were hoping it'd be.3 Rubik's Cubes out of 5"
" Watching the Watchers
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,7,"I don't know if I have enough thoughts on this yet for a full review - I know I liked it, maybe some of Snowden's personality himself rubbed off on me the wrong way at times (as with other stories of high-strung whistleblowers like Serpico and The Insider seeing the interactions the protagonists have with the women in their lives is hard to watch ... I should also note Woodsley was highly underrated in this, as was probably Gordon Levitt, but somehow I keep thinking about her and how, for one of the handful of times in Stone's career, Heaven & Earth included, he has a solid three-dimensional female character to work with, but I digress).But it features a solid script that doesn't necessarily have that feverish energy of the 80's/90's Stone movies - though, with age, Stone also therefore has appeal, one can hope if his name isn't too attached to those iconoclast cherry bombs, to middle America and people who want to see a simple good thriller, and this serves that purpose. It also has some of the strongest visual ideas Stone has had in a long time, maybe since Alexander or longer; the highlight of the film (aside from Nicolas Cage's precious minutes) is when Snowden faces his boss/mentor played by Rhys Ifans when he is in trouble, in a conference room, as the man's face is on a giant screen, seemingly 3 times Snowden's full size (but it seems to loom larger). That's the tense-as-s**t Stone I've been missing, and it's all done in shot-reverse-shot and largely dependent on the size of characters in the frame (in a sense it's sort of like the reverse of that scene in Network between Beatty and Finch).Maybe another viewing will change my mind, though it's hard to shake the fact that we already have CITIZENFOUR in this world, and that's kind of enough. So it's a good Stone film, it truly is, but it's missing that *something* that I can't describe just yet from his work in the 90's."

" Case for the Defence; prosecution need to rebut!
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,8,"This is a compelling biopic-thriller. A government employee, Edward Snowden, with computer expertise decides to leak information to the public that illegal invasion of privacy is being committed against millions of people by his employers. Based on actual events. The movie is made from the point of view of Snowden, portraying him as a saint and not a sinner. Maybe the picture is accurate. In real life many of those who are appalled by the hero worship of Snowden try to say he is a traitor and leaked information that caused great damage. As the subject of this film is so topical and current, maybe the detractors can make a similarly engrossing movie showing the actual harm done by Snowden's leaks. Until they do that, and do it convincingly, then many will be persuaded that Snowden deserves praise and not punishment. Super film!8/10."
" One Annoying and Unnecessary Effort from Joseph Gordon-Levitt
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,8,"Not to repeat the positive and negative points that so many have thoroughly written already... but, straight to the point: Joseph Gordon-Levitt's voice change (obviously) to imitate Edward Snowden was so annoying and not even necessary. His real voice is more alike Edward's than his imitation one (as one can confirm in the bonus material's interview or other interviews online).This is an important film on one of the most critical subjects (besides climate change, environmental concerns, pollution, overpopulation, etc.) in this modern era. Everyone should view it at least once and further explore the topic of concern for the sake of human rights, privacy rights, constitutional rights, government overreach, government illegal activities, government misleading and misinformation, whistle blowers'rights and their endured injustices...Regardless of what one's opinion of Oliver Stone's movies and his politics, this film is more fact based, less dramatized, and most balanced in its presentation than Oliver Stone haters have tried to smear in their knee-jerk-reaction campaigns.Overall (directing, acting, screenplay, cinematography): a solid 8Topic of concern: a definite 10"

I won't call him a hero because others should be standing right beside him who make those life and death decisions daily and haven't. I've always questioned the power/greed and need of our Government to insist on & what they unrightfully just take.

" A must watch
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,9,"For those of you who follow the news, Edward Snowden will need no introduction. For those of you who don't follow the news, Snowden is either a traitor who committed treason, or a whistle blowing hero who awakened the world to global cyber spying. The movie is Snowden's story. It begins when he was training to be a Special Forces soldier and was forced to quit due to a life altering leg injury. Still very much a patriot, Snowden joins the CIA. A computer genius, he helps to develop programs with disturbing consequences. Disenfranchised, Snowden leaves the CIA and gets involved with the NSA. In time, he steals classified material and flees initially to Hong Kong where he contacts journalists (See the film Citizen Four). He later ends up in Russia where he was give political asylum.I think the story of Snowden is one of the most important films of this era and people should be discussing the implications of cyber spying. People need to know that Snowden is a patriot of the United States and he did what he did because he loves his country and the people in it. By becoming a whistle-blower, Snowden lost everything including his country. For him and me, spying on people is not okay; I don't care how it is justified. It is a small step from knowing what everyone is doing every minute of the day, to complete global fascism which Nazi Germany could easily have achieved. Regardless of your standpoint, I urge everyone to see this film. At least then you will have Snowden's perspective, as opposed to just the official narrative."
" Watch this instead of, or along with, the documentary: Keep an open mind
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,10,"For those who don't like documentaries (the documentary about Snowden, which is part of this movie, is excellent education about what our government can do with us) watch this first. Oliver Stone paints a portrait of a stand-up, pretty much button down guy who realizes the work he falls into is anything but what he was taught was right -- and then he needs to find a way out, without endangering his girlfriend. Another great film about a whistleblower --- and for his whistleblowing, he faces far harsher penalties just for coming home. Oliver Stone delivers thought provoking film again, and the entire cast, as well as the writing, is stellar.For those who made up their mind about Ed Snowden through what was reported in mass media, I would simply say, watch this with an open mind. What happened to him could happen to any of us. This is a cautionary tale based on true facts told in the most exquisite way by Stone and his cast.Isabeau Vollhardt, author, The Casebook of Elisha Grey"
" Amazing film and this is coming from someone who may face the same fate
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,10,"I loved this yet I was already very aware of Snowden's actions. I do believe this was dumbed down a trickle but that is always the case with these kinds of Docos/Film/Series but that was quite minimal in this. My summery comes from being a hacker for 10+ years. I have worked high up in government sectors for cryptography, steganography, cyber warfare and much more. I have pending cases for the courts on my cyber espionage on the 13th of April 2017. I am not afraid... You are afraid is you lie or show immorality. What I released was to help the world and contains no degrees of deception so why be scared? I think this film really hit my soul as a hacktivist for so long, I found myself laughing and breaking down crying! Anyone who seeks freedom of information will love this. The message I always follow is People should never be afraid of their government... The government should shed fear from the people. Cicada 3301 ops signing out. Peace everyone!"
" Trading Freedom for Security
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,10,"The theme of this film-- hey, your government is now out of control. ""Homeland Security"" is the new Secret Police. 9/11 was won by Bin Laden, lost by the US (we lost our civil liberties and gained a National Security State). That we spy on our own citizens and anyone else in the world at will. That the internet has become a vast spying arena.Obama, after promising to dismantle these things, turned around and used them more than ever. Big Brother was 20 years late for the party, but he's here now and there's no turning back-- bar a revolution in thinking, which is impossible to fathom in a Trump administration.Benjamin Franklin had it right: ""Those who trade freedom for security deserve neither."" When did we as a nation become so fearful that we allow the government to run amok; to trade away all our privacy rights?A great and factual film by a brave and fearless director, Oliver Stone. Applause for him. Kudos all around. The acting is superb. If you don't follow these issues, they will be shown in all their evil. Watch carefully, things come fast and thick. Snowden was a patriotic geek working for the NSA, who saw things that turned him into a truth teller, and he had to leave the country or go to jail for a long, long time. Applause for him."
" Hero or Traitor
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,7,"Working for the United States government, as with any job, has both pluses and minuses. First, governmental work especially involving the National Security Agency gives their employees security clearance and access to the United States undercover information. While this top-secret information may be fascinating to know, this knowledge comes with a great responsibility and trust. Even if you don't necessarily agree with what the government is doing, it is your job to perform and execute to the job description or how it is outlined by your supervisors. ""Snowden"" directed by Oliver Stone is a movie based off of a real life story when Edward Snowden, a contract worker for the National Security Agency, leaked top-secret information about the United States government's tactics of surveillance to news agencies because he didn't agree with what the United States was doing and wanted people to know about what was happening. Some people believe Snowden's actions were a public service and people should know what the government is doing to keep track of them whereas others think that Snowden is a traitor to the United States. Despite the controversy surrounding Edward Snowden's leak of this information, the movie ""Snowden"" portrays his actions as a public service to citizens rather than betrayal against the government. The movie is told in retrospect of Snowden looking back on his whole experience working for the government as he tells the press what happened. Through these series of flashbacks, Snowden is able to illustrate his point of view about what the government is doing. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the actor playing Edward Snowden in the movie is a very respectable actor whose appearance and demeanor resemble Snowden and is well cast. Thus by casting Gordon-Levitt, the very second the audience sees ""Snowden"" they sense a familiar face and safe feeling. The film begins with Snowden's life prior to employment at the National Security Agency. Early scenes include his military training before being discharged secondary to his lower extremity injuries, education prior to entering entering the Central Intelligence Agency as well as meeting his girlfriend, Lindsay Mills. These scenes show different emotions and characteristics of Snowden. Through this backstory, the viewer is able to see Snowden's background, which helps the viewer to see him as a fairly ""regular"" moral U.S. citizen. Ultimately, including these scenes was a strategy in helping the viewer ""bond"" with Snowden. The movie's story line then builds to the conflict. Snowden is exposed to various government secrets and the ways the government keeps tabs on people. Snowden has a realization in the movie that citizens are treated more like objects sitting in a database than real-life human beings with rights that should be protected, not exposed by the U.S. government. Intense and emotional scenes show how much Snowden was grappling with what to do-- he was so deeply bothered knowing this yet did not want to betray his own country. Many people surrounding Snowden in the movie, were not too bothered by what was occurring, which further emphasizes the director's goal of making Snowden a hero. Once, Snowden releases the information, he flees America for protection from the U.S. government. During the last scene, the director cuts from from the actor playing Snowden, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, to the real Edward Snowden. The resemblance between the actor and the real Snowden, the smooth transition, and the whole idea behind the last shot really make the movie seem real to the viewer. This was an interesting twist, not usually used in movies, but was well done and seemed effective and intriguing. Overall, this movie was a way for Snowden to share his story with the world, while he is in hiding in Russia, without censorship or influenced by any authority. He was able to tell his side of the story without rebuttal about how the government was keeping watch on innocent U.S. citizens. Although many of Snowden's points may be valid, this movie was biased and looked at the issue from only one point of view. The movie did not fully acknowledge how much the government is able to do with this information it gathers in terms of the public safety. Snowden makes U.S. citizens question the role of government in protecting individuals as well as also makes people wonder about the level of loyalty and morality government employees must have and maintain and to what extent."
" Outstanding character building by Joseph Gordon-Levitt - even a bigger fan now!
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,9,"I went to watch Snowden with someone who was extremely well informed about the subject while I sadly wasn't and while we had extremely different perspectives going into it, I believe it is safe to say both thought the movie was pretty darn awesome. From the former point of view, it appears some important things were left out, while I kept getting stuck on stuff like how does a guy who did not even finish high school and obviously really wants to make it in Special Forces turn out to be such a genius, only being self-taught.The fact is the story enthralled me. Even if some things felt cheesy, especially the abuse of light surrounding the main character in key moments, the fact is due to such a strong issue and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's stellar performance (queue choir of angels – yes, I am biased towards this guy, sue me), this was indeed a memorable experience.I mean, that guy obviously did such a brilliant character study. I cannot get past how he placed his voice. The facial expressions and ticks, the way he held himself, a lovely mixture of a fragile and strong young man with principles literally held me at the edge of my seat sometimes – I had to keep reminding myself to sit back.Some things did throw me off besides what I mentioned above, such as the way he got the information out (the entire process just seemed oversimplified) – and really every single time he expressed his obviously dangerous points of view.However, I had a terrific time watching this and I highly recommend it. Makes me want to watch the documentary, to find out what really happened and what is just in the movie."
" A Whistleblower of Epic Proportions Is The Most Underrated Film of 2016
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,9,"What happens when someone reveals 1000's of classified documents to the public and even congressional leaders who were unaware of the information? They are charged under the Espionage Act of 1917 along with other charges of theft and conspiracy. It didn't only happen to Edward Snowden. The same fate befell Daniel Ellsberg 40 years before Edward Snowden risked everything to ensure the United States citizenry had ample information to make decisions about its leadership. Ellsberg released to the press the so-called ""Pentagon Papers"" which demonstrated the widespread failure of the Vietnam War. High-level military and CIA officials not to mention the Johnson Administration wanted the public shielded from the gross mishandling and immoral objectives of the war. Of course, if the public knew, they would be appalled and they were.Forty years later, computer genius Edward Snowden released to the public, both national and international, that the National Security Administration (NSA) was literally engaged in digital wiretapping of Americans. Certainly, if a known suspect was engaging in suspicious activities and the NSA and CIA wanted to spy on him to determine if he or she posed a threat, surveillance of this sort seems the appropriate response. However, supposedly in the interest of national security, the NSA decided to cast a huge net. While hunting for sharks, they ended up catching lots of harmless minnows, tuna, sun fish and blue gills. And all the fish were stored into large digital databases which can retrieved at any moment.In ""Snowden"" directed by Oliver Stone, Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Ed Snowden, bona fide computer wizard and eventual US whistle-blower. The film traces his early years in the military to applying for a job in the CIA. According to the film, he is at first a right-leaning conservative who approves of the War in Iraq hosted by the Bush-Cheney administration. His talents are noticed by those in the CIA, and he is awarded high-level tech jobs at the agency.His first stint is in Geneva, Switzerland where he learns about the CIA's dirty tricks to compel powerful civilians from other countries to disclose classified information. He learns about how the CIA is keeping tabs on millions of people, particularly those connected to the upper-reaches of political power. He is shown a set-up of a powerful banker out of Pakistan whose clients include billionaires from Saudi Arabia and Russia. First, they deport one of his daughters from the US. Phase two is to put the banker into a compromising position so it will seem he was driving drunk. The CIA hopes he will ""cut a deal"" with the US to avoid drunk driving charges. When Snowden sees these events, he resigns from the CIA.He eventually becomes a civilian contractor for the NSA and ends up straight in the heart of a surveillance program of epic proportions. The NSA, despite testifying to the contrary, has developed a program in which all emails and cell phone calls are tapped by the government. Not just the baddies but everyone in the world including Americans. In fact, the US is tapping into American citizens more than anyone else. He learns that in one month alone, the NSA tapped into 3.5 billion phone calls and emails. Will he be able to deal with this knowledge and simply do as he's told or will he have to let the world know about what's occurring? A brilliant film which asks the question: should governments be able to engage in any activity they desire without the consent of the governed? Even President Obama, who had every opportunity to arrest the program, allows the program to continue. Why? Because of supposedly the threat of national security at the hands of terrorists. And yet, according to the film, the threat of terrorism is minimal and the US government desires world domination in markets and other areas of international politics. Is this democratic or totalitarianism?"
" Scary reality
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,8,"This based of true story of Edward Joseph Snowden an American computer professional, former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee, and former contractor for the United States government, who copied and leaked classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013 without prior authorization. His disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance programs, many run by the NSA and the Five Eyes Intelligence Alliance, with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments. Then he went to Moscow, Russia, where he remained for over one month. Russian authorities granted him asylum for one year, which was later extended to three years. As of 2016, he was still living in an undisclosed location in Russia while seeking asylum elsewhere. Even if a fraction of what is shown in the movie is true this is scary. There is no privacy left in the internet era. US government can see your whole history through your digital footprints. There is no limit or authorisition required. They do it with impunity and get away with it. Movie is top notch. The lead of Gordon Levitt and Shailene Woodley is superb. Direction of Oliver stone is very good. The movie captivates you and keeps you engrossed. Must watch."

The cinematography was phenomenal and Joseph Gorden-Levitt gave an outstanding performance as always.Unfortunately, like most Oliver Stone films, very entertaining but always comes to the wrong conclusion. A lot of facts were omitted to tell an unbalanced story.This movie glorifies a man guilty of treason and undoubtedly put innocent lives at risk. There is no question people have died as a result of this technology rendered mute. This movie also glorifies the idiotic and unethical journalist Glenn Greenwald who basically was handed this story on a silver platter.I'm glad Snowden is rotting in Russia. That's worse than prison."
" Great movie. One of the best from Oliver Stone

This is his second feature film based on an Oscar-winning documentary Citizenfour (2014); after the feature film Walk (2015), which was based on Man on Wire (2008). I have watched both documentaries prior to the feature films and he portrays the characters really well. I highly recommend everyone to watch both feature films and documentaries. Snowden is one of the best movies from 2016. Directing , Cinematography, Casting, all are perfect. It keep you well entertained throughout the run time. Snowden is a must see on your 2016 watch list."

There is enough information so that anyone who has been living under a rock, or for someone too young at the time to know what happened, will understand the storyline.This was moving for me to watch because people like Edward Snowden are most definitely the heroes of our world.I believe that Oliver Stone, being the film maker that he is would have kept this as straight and factual as the reality of the situation; another film maker may have tweaked here and there and ruined what needs nothing extra to make it a sensational part of history.A must see."
" An apt biopic
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,7,"Oliver Stone's SNOWDEN does exactly what a film about a whistleblower must do in order to be an effective thriller: sets up the story, sets up the motivation, and presents an opinion of the subject. It's still a fairly hot-topic situation, as Snowden's massive leak to the press regarding NSA surveillance only happened a few years ago. Though the film has a few flaws that surely hamper it's overall effectiveness, the general thought presented is that ""Ed"" Snowden is our generation's Karen Silkwood; a hero of unlikely background.The film is structured in a sort of flashback, with Snowden's initial leak to the press in a small Tokyo hotel room lending itself to flashbacks of his life to this point. It's hard to imagine most people not knowing who Edward Snowden is at this point, especially considering a documentary surrounding his espionage just won an Oscar not 1 year ago. The film seeks instead to provide a backstory and shade the infamous man in a more human light - painting a portrait of what would lead a patriot to betray his beloved country.Joseph Gordon Levitt, I'll admit, has felt miscast in the past. He falls into roles greater than himself and fails to disappear into the character we see on screen. Surprisingly in ""Snowden,"" he actually succeeds. Deepened voice, loose-fitting clothes, and the slightest stubble, Levitt all but transforms in the role (all the more compelling when the film concludes with footage of the actual man and we barely notice that it is a new person). It's hard to classify his performance as someone who is sympathetic, but overall he does an effective job playing a man who finds himself in between a rock and hard place - that is to say the internal struggle he faces seems genuine.The backstory we follow finds Snowden meeting his long-time girlfriend, first seeing her chat on an online dating site while in military training, and finally meeting in Washington after he begins working for the CIA. Played by Shailene Woodley, the girlfriend role oftentimes falls into the category of ""emotional obstacle"" and in several scenes she and Snowden fight only to keep the story juicy and the plot flowing. While good in the past (The Descendants, The Fault In Our Stars) Woodley is given very little to do in this film and tries her hardest to make the role her own.I was very much impressed with the front-half of this picture, and I found the setup and introduction to our characters to be very effective. Snowden is initially hired on to work for the CIA and has some great scenes getting to know his supervisors and teachers (one of which is Nicholas Cage in a curiously-small role). We learn about who he is, how smart he is, and how his early work with the government would ultimately shape his story. It's too bad that the rest of the film fails to match the energy. Overly-clanky with flashbacks and flashforwards, it becomes fairly tedious to journey back and forth between present- day Tokyo to Hawaii or Europe or any variety of places in the States. Oliver Stone (co- screenwriter) had a lot of material to sort through, but it seems like the structure of the story was flawed slightly along the way.I still praise the film, with it's strong leading performance and intriguing (albeit biased) account of this decade's most notorious government leak. Yes, the film makes it clear that Edward Snowden should be regarded as a saint - someone who uncovered mass conspiracy within our government and worked only to protect the USA's citizens. The movie serves as a supplement to the real man, and perhaps can help in forming opinions of whether or not his actions were ethical. Though Oliver Stone has made better films in the past, ""Snowden"" is still an effective biopic that warrants a viewing."
" another history spin by oliver stone
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,2,"Stone does a disservice to future generations by putting his own spin on important national topics. Is there some truth to his stories, yes, but mostly he creates hyperbolic and personal views of his subjects as if he was a comic strip creator, not a movie producer/director. The intelligence community is pretty anal when it comes to security. If you've ever worked in the field they usually put up a lot of fences that prevent getting anything done. That a system engineer is able to steal the information snowden he did is very perplexing but there's been little media attention to this. Anyway, snowden is portrayed as this supremely intelligent hacker with unique access to programs and data. I don't know the real story but what I've seen of snowden in interviews is not very impressive. The bit about putting a towel over his head to protect his passwords had me rolling on the floor. All the tech talk and exaggerated capabilities of the nsa/cia is hogwash made up by someone ignorant of the field. It's just that kind of ignorance that has created a huge industry for consumer data protection and given the green light to the govt to waste billions of dollars every year on useless programs. Consider the DNC hack as an example. This was all human error not some sophisticated tech hack as covered in the media but you bet software security companies will make a mint off this. For a better idea of the truth behind the programs snowden complained about, read bamford's books."
" Not sure about its sincerity and authenticity, but I just enjoyed it as a well made thriller full of good performances
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,7,"Edward Snowden has had an interesting episode in his life defying the most powerful spy agency and in the process becoming both a hero and a villain depending on our view of his actions. What Oliver Stone got right is his casting and what he got wrong is that he picked a side. Considering this is a contemporary issue with an on-going raging debate about his actions, a popular movie showcasing Edward Snowden as a hero will no doubt influence the public perception whoever doesn't watch it with an open mind.Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a patriotic youngster who joins the army to serve his country. When a training accident leaves him unfit for field duty, his expertise and interest in computers leads him to join the training for the virtual battleground under his mentor Corbin O'Brian (Rhys Ifans). When he meets his liberal girlfriend Lindsay Mills (Shailene Woodley), a section of his thought process gets unlocked leading to him questioning the actions of his agency and also himself. On the side, the sequences shown in the documentary where Snowden meets journalists and filmmakers Laura Poitras (Melissa Leo), Glenn Greenwald (Zachary Quinto) and Ewen MacAskill (Tom Wilkinson) in a Hong Kong hotel unfolds in a non-linear mode; There is no doubt about the weight of Snowden's revelations. Snooping on the private space of normal citizens across the world including the domestic American citizens is something that cannot be ignored. At the same time, how else does a security agency preempt an attack or a conspiracy without having options to filter between harmless and dangerous? It is a very thin line on which most of the security agencies around the world might walk in.Getting Joseph Gordon-Levitt to play the titular character is job half done for Oliver Stone. Though Levitt looks already all geeky, he's hardly had an opportunity to play one and when he got one, he gives a performance par excellence. Bringing in the veterans like Leo and Wilkinson along with a proved talent like Quinto adds in the necessary depth and seriousness to the recreated documentary sequences. However the dramatization and and fictionalization might have gone a little too far when showing the entire NSA personnel having a very callous attitude towards private data of citizens which could not be true.All the performances were excellent and especially enjoyed a very restrained performance by Nicolas Cage after such a long time. The background score adds to the thrill in some scenes and the screenplay is good in parts. However the runtime might be a little too long for a story which most knows how it ends. The bias is clearly visible when Snowden is shown as a hero and it could evoke some passionate discussions and debates from opinionistic viewers which is good for the movie.Not sure about its sincerity and authenticity, but I just enjoyed it as a well made thriller full of good performances."
" Stone's Snowden is Rock Solid
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,8,"I was never interested in seeing this film. This may seem surprising as I spend much of my time investigating cybersecurity. However, I had my reasons for this. First of all, I had already watched Citizenfour, the documentary on the Snowden incident. I found it mildly interesting but not compelling. Why would I want to watch a Hollywood production on the same topic? Secondly, I was suspicious about a film created by Oliver Stone. Stone seems to have an agenda that is too visible in many of his films. He's not as bad as the pseudo-documentarian, Michael Moore, but I was worried that I would get too much of Stone and too little of Snowden. Finally, why would I want to watch a movie for which I already knew the ending? I call this the 'zen of movie watching"". This is a movie you watch to enjoy the process rather than the conclusion. It can usually only be pulled off by a well-constructed movie. Death of a Salesman, for example, tells you the ending in the title. The play (or movie) shows you what events led to that final moment. Would I really be interested in seeing how Snowden ended up in Moscow, especially since I already knew the story? To get right to the point, my doubts were not justified. This was a good film. It is not simply the events shown in the documentary but more the story behind the story. The film's success largely rests on the performance of the lead actor's portrayal of Snowden. In this regard, the often under-rated, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, does a remarkable job. It has been reported that even Snowden's family praised the similarities between Gordon-Levitt's portrayal and Snowden, himself. Gordon-Levitt claimed that he repeatedly listened to Snowden's speech patterns in Citizenfour so as to get them correct. Whatever; he managed to bring the Snowden character to life.Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the acting of Shailene Woodley, who played Snowden's romantic interest, Lindsay Mills. For the life of me, I could not fathom how Snowden could become so interested in such a two-dimensional woman. It was difficult to see any on-screen chemistry between the two and Woodley's stilted, robotic performance didn't help matters any. I kept hoping he would dump her and get on with his life, but, sadly, she kept interrupting the flow of the film. I can only assume that the real Lindsay Mills was much more charismatic.In contrast, the relationships between Snowden and his superiors and colleagues is quite well done. This and Snowden's battle with his own conscience make for the most compelling elements of the film. Stone may have an agenda, but he also shows both sides of the security vs. privacy debate. If he did not, we would never fully understand the dilemma that Snowden was cast into. It is this, and not the romantic relationship, that kept me interested throughout the film.For the average, cybersecurity-naiive viewer, much of what you see will be eye-opening. I'm sure many will not believe that what they see is true, but be assured it is. Most of all, this was an unexpectedly entertaining movie which I think most people will enjoy. I especially liked the extra touch at the end, which I will not reveal in this review."
" It's beyond Awesome word....
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,10,"Great work by whole team of Snowden. There efforts paid off and i hope what they want to show, exactly that have been shown. This is the first time i am writing a review for a movie. It's worth to write a review for a guy who has put lot of efforts and still fighting for it. Yep it's sad to see getting mixed reviews. I can't comment on public review as everyone has there own perception and own thinking, how they look movie. I look every particular scene and i take all positive things. I loved the role played by Joseph and he has nailed it. Thanks all for putting lot of efforts and making such a nice movie inspired by true events."
" Motivations can make villains, as well as heroes
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,7,"When you watch an Oliver Stone flick, you get his slant, and not real history. The personal reasons of the subject are not the issue here. I give this a grudging 7 of 10, based upon a good illustration of the protagonist's motivations. But so far, history has shown, no benefit was derived from his actions, and far more damage to people's lives. Stone leaves out the damage done to peoples lives that resulted from Snowden's actions. All of history is full of patriots and tyrants who have had Snowden's motivations. In this case, he failed. Snowden wasn't a tyrant, but he certainly was a villain. The individual lives he damaged are unredeemed. And all the government had to do, was just write some different programs and change placement of assets, and discard painfully physical as well as mental damage to the human assets. Very sad. Why do smart liberal people think their outcome will be positive, when all that is certain is the damage? To me, hurting people because of a very slim chance of a positive outcome is morally repugnant. But once again, morals have little to do with the actions of men like Snowden."
" Obama should have pardoned Snowden on our behalf
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,9,"I'm so sorry I didn't make the time to see it while it was playing in theaters. I suppose I shied away from being any more jacked up about our intelligence communities than I already was. But now with the election behind us and with the possibility of Snowden being pardoned having just passed, I could summon up the courage to see a work of political art that might send me into a deep depression.I'm not depressed having seen it now, but I am incensed. Perhaps there's been some poetic license taken but I've no doubt it's minor and beside the point. The argument is well made that Washington has gone too far and that Snowden's acts were more than warranted. The best analogy I can think of for the core issue is a father wanting to keep his daughter safe by locking her in her room. Does it work? Yes. But should any red- blooded American girl allow it? No. It's tantamount to a denial of her fundamental right to a life of her own making. Oliver Stone has given expression to the millions of progressives who have applauded the supposedly treasonous acts of Edward Snowden and in a lot of ways this is his greatest career accomplishment yet.As a movie, the first half is fairly miraculous given the technical nature of the action. Nevertheless, what is going on is made elegantly and unmistakably clear by a score of brilliantly constructed scenes. And every established actor, and there are quite a few, seems further elevated by their inclusion in this politically risky, but near heroic, work. The second half is less impressive, but that's mostly because of the real-life, mindless acts of our elected and appointed officials.If there's a bad side to all this, it does shed an unfavorable, but accurate, light on Obama's administration, and there's little appetite for that given our recent election."
" Potent and powerful ... and real.
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,10,"Once in a while there is a film that shows some courage to tell events of a true story ... Oliver Stone, is a director who continues to highlight the injustice of the American government and the lengths it goes to. Snowden is a hero and will be remembered as such, when those who tried to tarnish him for speaking the truth, will have their legacy crumble.The man is a hero.I recently watched ""American Sniper"" and was blown away by the 'patriotism' bullshit propaganda that was almost on par with the the nazi propaganda scenes from Tarantino's ""Inglorious Bastards"".This however, is relevant, important to us all ... and above all ... continues to happen, without our permission or knowledge.I urge people to watch the film."
" The Snowden story, well told
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,8,"Oliver Stone is such a great director. He's succeeded once again in producing an interesting and sympathetic historical movie, this time about the Edward Snowden whistle-blowing story. His movies are so credible, so finely crafted, so watchable.It is a pleasure to just sit back and let Stone show Snowden's story to you. I can't imagine anyone ever producing a Snowden movie that is better than this one. I felt the story was presented objectively and neutrally. Only near the end did the political aspect become a little too much. Yes, Stone is taking a pro-Snowden position and is trying to convince you that his position is right. If you are unable to emotionally handle that didactic aspect, don't see this movie.Can I also talk about Joseph Gordon-Levitt? The man is clearly a great actor with enormous range. He's been in dozens of movies now, and his performances in each of them have been excellent. He really does capture Snowden in this movie. Kudos to him, Stone and everyone else involved in this film."
" Eye opening
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,8,"Whether one supports what Snowden did or not, this movie is watchable, well made and well acted. Before this movie I wasn't that familiar with what he actually disclosed except that it was overreaching by the NSA spying on everyone including innocent people and friendly countries and their heads of state like Angela Merkel. Oliver Stone does a good job of showing Snowden's story from his beginnings in cyber security to his disillusionment. By the end of the movie the point is clear - the NSA was spying on people for reasons beyond terrorism like economic gain. And the point of the people disclosing the scandal is that invasion of privacy violates our civil rights and undermines freedom and democracy. Also cover up by the NSA CIA and the administration is shown. So the case in support of disclosure is made. For completeness I would have liked some characters arguing against disclosure like if the disclosures compromised terrorist surveillance and let the main characters rebut their arguments.It helps to watch Citizenfour before or at least know what about the main disclosures because the characters speak very fast and sometimes the viewer can get lost during the technical dialog. Maybe some narration would have helped.Joseph Gordon Levitt now slightly older looking does a good job of imitating Snowden's voice and manner. He portrays him as calm logical intelligent and sure that what he is doing is right. Shaliene Woodley plays his loyal girlfriend Lindsay.Nice on location filming around the world including Hong Kong.Even for people who can't decide if he is a hero or not this eye opening movie make the viewer think about how much we are all being watched. Also about the consequences of whistle blowing."
" I Love America...Honest!
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,7,"Here's The Lowedown on ""Snowden"" (R - 2016 - US)...Liked IT!Genre: Drama/Biopic My Score: 7.4Cast=10 Acting=9 Plot=8 Ending=6 Story=7 History=7 Political=7 Pace=3 Filming=9 Script=8The NSA's illegal surveillance techniques are leaked to the public by one of the agency's employees, Edward Snowden, in the form of thousands of classified documents distributed to the press.First let me say I love America!! Joseph-Gordon Levitt's portrayal of Ed Snowden was SPOT ON!! It was well written and directed by Oliver Stone...plus it has an amazing cast!!! The only bad note I can mention really is the pace of the film. It was interesting, but was too slow for me. ""You didn't tell me we were running a dragnet on the whole world, Corbin"". It's worth a watch, but your house may be bugged because of it. I think I'll stop talking now...did I mention how much I love America?!!"
" ""I Support Online Rights""
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,8,"""I support online rights"" – it's the sentence glued to Edward's Snowden laptop cover. Although it's only seen near to the final scene, it's the core, the driving force, the backbone of all film and Snowden real life choices. As we know, every choice come with a consequence either positive or negative. However the citizen had to be forced to go out of his birth country, he never lost his hope and motivation to show the world, the modern society that we should fight for our rights, even those which are sometimes disrespected by our own government entities. The conduction of the narration and scene sequence were very well thought, and made the general public understand every step of Snowden, and what sort of reality he needed to deal. It's also to be praised the courage and bravery that he had to put himself and his family in danger, but first of all the incredible idea of hiding a memory card in a Rubik's Cube."
" Hero Or Traitor?
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,7,"I watched this movie with no real stake in it. I'm aware of Edward Snowden and have a little bit of familiarity with what he did, but I don't really have a position on whether he's a hero or a traitor. The perspective of this movie is clear. Directed and co-written by Oliver Stone, it's hardly surprising that the film falls on the ""hero"" side of that question. And, to the extent that the movie is an accurate portrayal of events, that's certainly an arguable position to take.The movie presents us with basically ten years of Snowden's life. He begins as a soldier, trying to get into Special Ops, but he just isn't good enough and eventually is discharged because he's not physically up to the job. He ends up working for the CIA (and later the NSA) and during those years we see a gradual evolution in his understanding of his work. He progresses from a man who simply wanted to serve his country and help keep it safe to someone who concluded that the country he was serving wasn't the country he thought it was. One gets the impression that his real disappointment was in Barack Obama, who became president but changed nothing. His disillusionment, caused by his growing realization that a lot of the American intelligence services were actually busy primarily keeping tabs illegally on every day, law-abiding Americans, eventually leads to his decision to become a whistle blower and finally a man without a country - living in Russia, but with no place really to go. He did have the satisfaction, though, of seeing his leaks result in the surveillance program being supposedly cancelled. (Although - who knows?)The movie provided a fascinating (and somewhat frightening) look at the ability of US Intelligence to keep track of its citizens activities (and presumably other countries have the same ability.) It's hard to watch this and not feel just a little bit paranoid, although I've been able to resist the temptation to put a band-aid over my laptop camera lens. And yet, while perhaps frightening, it's also hard not to be grudgingly impressed by what you see. Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a fine job as Snowden. I also liked Gordon- Levitt's work in ""The Walk."" He's become a very fine actor since his early days as Tommy on ""3rd Rock From The Sun."" The movie has as its background Snowden's meeting with two reporters to whom he gives the classified information that he stole (who are played by Melissa Leo and Zachary Quinto, who both were good but weren't really central in my opinion to the point of the movie, except that they facilitated the information getting out to the public.) There was a lot of reflection on Snowden's relationship with his girlfriend Lindsay, played by Shailene Woodley. Theirs was an up and down relationship - not surprisingly perhaps, since Snowden had to keep so much of his life and work secret even from her. Woodley, who I'm not familiar with, was fine in the role - and quite lovely as well. I was pleasantly surprised to discover in the captions as the movie ended that Lindsay had joined Snowden and now lives with him in Moscow.My biggest criticism of the movie is that it was rather slow moving, and I thought a bit disjointed. There were times when I was having some trouble fitting all the various pieces together. It was an interesting movie, but it wasn't a movie that captivated me or held me spellbound. In the end, while I'm more sympathetic to Snowden, I also understand why the hero or traitor question is still an open one. It's certainly a complicated issue that will probably always polarize people."
" Interesting but biased
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,6,"As the others that reviewed this I was expecting more of a dramatization. In that respect, it was rather dry and made the only thing to make it worth watching my general curiosity. It still amazes me that people are so naive in the information that's collected on them. Honestly people, if you think our government is truly collecting everything you do, you are seriously naive. Acxiom, buys more information on you than any other data broker. The FBI rarely needs to do any investigation on people, they just have a subscription and pull it up. Most of what the NSA collected was meta-data, just basically index cards to locate data. Granted, still the best way to link people with each other. Back to the movie, it's biased and fails to address the intercepted communications from the Taliban that he revealed. Seriously, why gloss over the stuff that was leaked on what everyone would agree they are supposed to be doing in combating terrorism. The movie, though interesting failed to provide an accurate picture of everything that occurred."
