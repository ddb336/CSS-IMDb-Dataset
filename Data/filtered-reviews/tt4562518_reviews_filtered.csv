" Successful writer exposes himself on revisiting home village .
",2021-03-18 00:00:00,10,"I read this film as an anatomy of the artist's ego. From the opening ceremony to his panic flight from his home town Daniel Mantovani is a completely self-absorbed and destructive figure. Whether the resultant novels balance the scales is an unanswerable question. But the question stands: How far can art go to excuse the artist from the criteria for a good human being?
Daniel starts in the catbird seat - receiving the Nobel Prize for Literature - but in an aggressively disrespectful manner. He eschews the tuxedo, refuses to bow to the presiding royals and declares that he will now cease writing because that very award suggests he has not been upsetting enough to the literary world.
He lives in a palatial estate. The massive library curving under his main floor suggests that culture is the foundation of his house, his life. As he proceeds through a litany of refusing invitations and cancelling engagements that anchor seems to weigh him down. Impetuously accepting an immediate visit to his small home town confirms his exclusive self-concern.
Daniel's return to the small town which he fled - and refused to return to, even for his father's funeral - is into the lion's den. What begins as the town's fulsome celebration of their world-famous escapee turns into their vicious rejection. His succession of car breakdowns proves the animosity mutual.
Daniel has been basing his stories on the people and places he remembers from that town, Salas. We see it as a dismal, empty, pedestrian community that shrinks further in its every pretension to honour him: the windy mayor, the honorary citizen medal, the volunteer fire department, the vapid beauty queen. On the spectrum of classical music it's a Mantovani.
Whatever his reason for returning there, Daniel refuses to respect the town and its people. He's courteous to the man who invites him home for lunch. But the request to fund a young man's $10,000 wheelchair becomes an opportunity for him to lecture the father on the inappropriateness of personal charity.
The disaster begins when Daniel heads a jury selecting works for the community art show. He shows no respect for the community's needs and responsibilities, rejecting works here for the reasons he might in Buenos Aires or Madrid. He promotes one work for an accidental expressiveness that attests to Daniel's sophistication not the artist's. The consequent attack on him spreads from his disrespect for their efforts to his insulting treatment of their people and traditions jn his fiction.
Given the references to Borges and the Latin American setting, we might be primed to expect Magic Realism. The stark colours in the streets, the vulgarity in the Volcano bar, the extravagant characterization may approach that - but the ending cinches it.
Daniel is forcibly taken on a wild pig hunt by his old friend Antonio (who married Daniel's old girlfriend Irene) and the yob dating their daughter. Still jealous of Irene's long-held love for Daniel, Antonio takes great pleasure in running him out of town, especially as he fires his rifle at him, narrowly missing. But Daniel is felled by the yob, whose specialty has been defined as efficiently killing the prey their clients miss.
So. Does Daniel die there? Could be. Then the epilogue in which his publisher presents him with his new novel, based on that trip, could be the last story the novelist tells. He's telling it to himself. His reappearance sans beard lets him live the story he told earlier of the two rival brothers, both doomed to murder.
Or Daniel survives the marksman's shot, is rushed to a hospital and flown home, where his replay of the adventures we have witnessed turns into his new novel. The scar he reveals could be from that hunt - or some other accident. This ending may be harder to believe. It's also undercut by the pointlessly loud glasses he wears at the end, implying an exaggeration of vision.
We don't have to choose between those endings. For the point is that Daniel is compelled to tell stories. To pontificate, as re:the wheelchair. To strike a posture whether dominant or recessive, as when he responds to the young woman's question about whether an artist needs to suffer in order to create. No, he says now, but she pops up with the proof that he said the reverse elsewhere.
It's because he has to tell a story that he can't maintain an ethical responsibility. So he'll abandon the wheelchair denial. He slips into the matinee seduction by that young woman. Indeed he's on the verge of describing it to friend Antonio when the woman appears - she's Irene's and Antonio's daughter.
Daniel will do anything, on impulse, for the sake of a good story. That's why he leans over to kiss Irene in her stalled car - as if testing a new (and disastrous) plot-line. He lives to narrate. His roots are in his library not his emotions and relationships. Great artists live by their own standards. That's how we lesser console ourselves."
" Darkly comic
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,7,"A dark comedy from Argentina, wry and insightful, occasionally hilarious. Perhaps influenced a little bit by the Coen brothers, it's a neatly told tale which takes its time to get to the point, but is very satisfying all the same."
" Argentines Present a Scathing Self-Portrait that Has Universality and is Engagingly Entertaining!
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,9,"You most certainly don't have to be Argentine to savor the cultural pearls and warts highlighted in The Distinguished Citizen (EL CIUDADANO ILUSTRE) But, I must admit, somewhat reluctantly, that had I not spent many hours interacting with dozens of my English students from Argentina, in my near-native Spanish language, many of the subtle ironies presented in this gem would have been much less appreciated!Of course Argenitines. like people from most countries, are not particularly keen on negative comments and criticism of their culture from outsiders....But as evidenced clearly in CITIZEN, their self insight is. at once, so vicious and poignant, that critiques from outsiders could only be labeled as redundant! No one could possibly do a more precise and insightful analysis than Argentines themselves!Nobel Prize winning author Daniel Mantovani refuses to let admirer's expectations pigeonhole, limit or define him in any way! The film provides a detailed account of just how author Mantovani, at every juncture, insists on walking his own path, which steadfastly eschews conforming to comportment society deems to be ""Normal""!The Distinguished Citizen (EL CIUDADANO ILUSTRE) is truly a joy to watch!
A todos mis amigos Argentinos... Les felcito! Una Maravilla de Pelicula!
9 Estrellas sobre 10!ENJOY!/DISFRUTELA!"
" Good movie
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,5,"It is a good movie, it is not a comedy, is more like a drama. Good twist at the end."
" Brilliant
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,9,"2 standouts for me:
""Why don't you write about nice things"" & Hypocrisy."
" Good idea, bad execution
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,7,"The story is worth watching, and if you are from some small places like me, you can feel related if you understand that it's not trying to be subtle, and if you have found some of those bizarre characters in little towns, you are going to find this not surreal at all. Writing is good and I suspect the only reason (besides the leading actor) this have got some prices. But sadly but the movie it's badly directed, and the worst part for me it's photography, I don't care if they didn't have a huge budget, you could do much better with a decent director of photography. The feeling of cheapness comes from a poor and amateurish use of camera and lighting, not from the equipment used."
" el ciudadano ilustre
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,8,A writer from Europe who returned home after winning the Nobel Prize has been treated by many people to worship and humiliated by his ugly hometown. There is also cold humor in a trapped situation. Tangle with sympathy.
" Well written and acted but visually poor
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,7,"A fascinating tale of a Nobel-winning author's triumphant and sentimental return to his Argentinian hometown, a visit which soon turns sour. Unfortunately I t's also one of the ugliest films visually that I've seen, shot in low quality hand held digital video, with no lighting, colour grading or cinematography to speak of."
" El ciudadano ilustre (original title)
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,10,"Is the world writer Daniel Montavani (Oscar Martinez), who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in the center of his film.
A successful writer, living in Europe, 40 years away from his home town of Salas, receives an invitation from Salas to accept the Nobel Prize for Literature , and to receive the ""Respected Citizen"" award, and decides to go home after many years. With
his return to this small town, the townspeople he has been subject to in his novels and the tragedy they had with his first love, Irene and her husband Antonio, are told in a funny way.
It flows like water for 2 hours, where humor is never missing in its dose and place. Management, acting, environmental use, places, everything, everything is perfect. Oscar Matrinez, who plays Daniel, is at the peak of his career. he showed a great acting. Just like a nobelist writer. They mutually pour the youth friend Dady Brieva who played Antonio. Dady's dance is super super, you gotta see it. I liked it very much. I enjoyed it tremendously.
Have a good time watching everyone

" you don't know where this homesickness is placed.
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,7,"You know the excitement of life: the Nobel Prize from the Royal Family, and the Outstanding Citizen Award from the Mayor. You all know the embarrassment of life: sitting on the plane and hearing your name on the radio, recording a TV program suddenly inserted ads. Inexplicable in life, you all know: you have to buy a wheelchair for fellow teenagers, and you have to go to the invitation of strangers. The cemetery where the former residence was used for other purposes is deserted: you just don't know where this homesickness is placed."
" Absolutely hilarious...
",2019-11-08 00:00:00,9,"...one of the best movies about human nature that i've ever seen! Oscar Martínez and Dady Brieva are perfect (but all the cast is good and Belén Chavanne is hotter than hell). The dance and screaming pig scene had me rolling on the floor in tears and now i will check everything about Gastón Duprat, Mariano Cohn and Andrés Duprat's work because i love social satire and they seem great at it."
" Awesome and unexpected
",2019-10-12 00:00:00,9,"The movie starts deceptively simple. At first, I thought of it as a light-hearted comedy. It is anything but. The movie is full of surprises.Although every character is belivable, the situations they engender verge on the surreal. The movie is rich with not-so-subtle irony."
" Keeps you guessing
",2019-07-13 00:00:00,9,"This is a perplexing story from Argentina about fame and the fact that as Thomas Wolfe advised, you can never go home again. A pampered writer, in fact, a Nobel prize winner, impulsively decides to return to his native village which he left half a century ago without ever returning. He longs to revisit where it all began and our sympathy is with him because who hasn't longed to retrace the paths of life to see what might have been? The provincials in his home town pull out all the stops to curry favor with the man, lectures are scheduled, there's a parade,, he asked to judge the local art contest and they erect a hastily improvised statue of him. But instead of understanding their jealousy of his fame mingled with their genuine pride in his accomplishments, he pompously mocks their country ways and their longing to escape from the monotony of provincial life. Suddenly the tables are turned; we see the the bumpkins as honest and fallible human beings even if they lack the will and talent to escape, and the writer is revealed to be the pompous ass he probably has always been. This transformation is very skillfully done in a film that is at once funny and sad. Highly recommended."
" Must see
",2019-07-13 00:00:00,10,"Excellent film, great script and fine performances. Highly recommendable."
" Masterpiece
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,10,Masterpiece full of symbolism and exquisite narration.
" It's a good story, but the language and rhythm of this shot can't be called a literary film without torture.
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,6,"When the audience was tormented to the extreme by the absurd homecoming trip, they were kicked into the deep well by a book. It's a good story, but the language and rhythm of this shot can't be called a literary film without torture."
" Distinguished writer
",2019-01-07 00:00:00,9,This is how a movie should be like. every moment of this was meaningful and the cast were chosen perfectly. It should be even watched twice.
" Thomas Wolfe Was Right: The Distinguished Citizen
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,8,"Thomas Wolfe once wrote that we can never go home again. He meant that we could not go back to a time when home was the same as it is in our memories. Homes change, cities change, people change; everything changes. That is the theme of the wonderful Argentinian film "" The Distinguished Citizen"". It is a well-written, well-directed, and well-acted film about trying to go home again, and the ultimate impossibility of accomplishing a goal that meets our memories. I generally do not like films about writers; and I particularly loathe films about writers with ""writer's block"" because there is no such thing. A writer writes, all the time, and never has enough time to write about all the things he or she wants to write about. I am a writer. I have several books on Amazon. I could never stop writing. A real writer never stops writing for any reason. But this film does not really center on writer's block; it is about trying to recapture one's past. And of course, the protagonist is doomed in his quest. The film goes on to show us why. If you are a successful writer, people will be jealous and try to discredit you. If you are an unsuccessful writer, people will encourage you and give you more credit than you deserve. Writing is too important to be left to the uninspired. The acting is first rate and I recommend this film highly."
" Good
",2018-09-07 00:00:00,8,Good movie. I recommend it. It gives a good perception of the meaning of art and literature and at the same time explores the psichology of the characters.
" Good but not great. Just enough for a tuesday morning.
",2018-08-23 00:00:00,7,"Great movies can be made on a budget, this is not the case but neither is a bad movie. I think this movie has a very interesting story and leaving a couple of main actors aside, very simple acting.
The main character acting is very good, his dialogues and words have been carefully selected. As told for himself 'simple is sometimes artistic'.
Bottom line: good movie."
" An honest argentinian review
",2018-07-12 00:00:00,1,"As an Argentinian, I'm very sorry this movie is representing us in the film industry. I cant' believe how aclaimed it was on its release, as if it was a comedy masterpiece. 
Well, not even close.
Very poor acting, bad writing and dialogues, no chemistry at all the between characters, no music score, an the worst of all... an awful camera work. Overall it looks and feels like an amateur attempt or maybe a home made movie, with not much interest put to it.
I apologize in behalf of my country to the people on the world who have wasted their time watching this piece of garbage."
" The Return of the King
",2017-11-18 00:00:00,6,"""El ciudadano ilustre"" or ""The Distinguished Citizen"" is an Argentinean 2-hour film from 2016 that was the country's official submission to the Oscars last year, but did not manage the same successes like other entries from the South American country recently as it did not even make the short list of 9. However, it's all good because the movie managed a great deal of recognition at all kinds of other award shows. It is at this point probably the career-defining work for directors Gastón Duprat and Mariano Cohn and it seems Duprat's brother Andrés was in charge of the script here. This is a film not based on real events, the story of a Nobel Peace Prize winner for Literature and right early on in his acceptance speech we see that he is a complicated character indeed as what he talks about, the simple man's worries that his works may no longer be about as proved through this prestigious award, eventually satisfies the upper class again. What follows afterward is a return for him to his roots and exactly to these simple men's worries.The main character is definitely not a saint as we find out on many occasions, even if many of the conflicts are not really because of him. The best example is his main antagonist as he cannot accept the writer's artistic integrity that he picked another painting. Still, even that one makes a point asking why the protagonist did not even return for his dad's funeral. This is not a film about returning home and finding one's true roots. It is actually the opposite as it is about returning home and finding that all roots are gone basically and that the people there, partially because of envy, do not like you anymore, even if they try their best at not showing their disapproval for the most part. The film starts relatively light, but becomes darker and darker the longer it goes in showing us how he does not fit in there anymore. References about violence and death are the logical consequence. I think this was a really good character study with many interesting moments and I also liked that it was not all bad at the end, for example he helped a young writing prospect and maybe he saw himself in him too when he was younger obviously. The film delivers from both comedy and drama perspective I think. The only major thing I did not like was in the end that the daughter's ex-boyfriend pulled the trigger. I was missing a bit of a connection there. Sure he was a brute and may be angry and sad that she left him if she really did, but it felt slightly unrealistic to me. Maybe the guy who invited him to dinner would have been the better choice. But then again I like the idea that it was one of his closest that fired the shot, even if the filmmakers eventually weren't brave enough to really kill him off. Eventually, we see him again in the world where he belongs to. As a whole a film that was fun to watch from start to finish and filmmakers can learn a lot from it I'm sure. It's witty, deep and relevant and on a subjective side-note it has the stunning Belén Chavanne in it, a Gaucho mix of Emma Stone and Tracy Spiridakos. Minor flaws keep me from giving this one an even higher rating. But I still definitely very much recommend seeing this one. It really took way too long to finally reach Germany. But the wait was worth it and I give it a comfortable thumbs-up."
" A parody of true genius
",2017-09-26 00:00:00,6,"The movie The Distinguished Citizen is a parody of the question: what is art? The movie opens up with the lead player receiving an award. An award with lots of status attached to it. As the movie takes the player forward into time, the lead actor, owns a mansion filled with books in Barcelona - high in the mountains and overlooking the cityscape below. The Distinguished Citizen, (which I think should be called, The Distinguished Gentleman because the lead actor is very similar in style to Richard Gere, a very suave man of a high class) seems to have a void inside of him, because the film shots seem to suggest a loneliness. In order to attempt at filling this void the lead actor travels to his home town. There one episode of dismay merges into another episode of dismay - however in a round-about way, this is exactly what the lead actor appeared to be wanting and needing in his soulless life - which appeared void of human meaning. Somehow, the lead character emerges from everything in a very positive way and in the end he becomes even more successful than before. I like movies that have a good beginning, middle and clear end, and this was one of those movies. It was a good film experience for me."
" To be is not to stop being.
",2017-09-18 00:00:00,8,"Amazing movie!!! Not your usual topic and not with your usual characters. All I can say is I feel identified a lot with these movie because I came from a hometown with a lot of similarities with Salas, at least in the folklore of the place, the marvellous characters of the town, all with his own problems and with his own way of living. I can't say I was boring at anytime when I see these movie, and the movie don't have any type of action scenes that make an impact in the common eye of the viewer , but the work of the main and secondary characters are so good through all the movie that I can't complaint. Not at all. As a young man with some ambitions and aspirations to continue my career in a foreign country, I hope my homecoming would be different, in a positive way, than Daniel's. And remember, to be is not being."
" No one is a prophet in their own land
",2017-09-04 00:00:00,8,"Being an Argentine (sans the Nobel prize as the main protagonist achieved) away from Argentina for over 43 years I could totally relate to the topic of this movie. I liked the main character in how clear he is about his convictions, his work, his principles and how all of this clashes against the bureaucracy, guilt, jealousy which awaits for him when he comes home... The movie is a great study of change and lack of change. His travel brings him perspective and intelligence ... The main character is a writer who forces himself to go back to his birth place and finds a world which has not changed and which projects onto him what they want him to be. This may happen to many of you writing when you go back home after not being there for a while... this movie is an extreme case of that: going back from a first world to the third world he came from. (Not Buenos Aires but a small town 500 miles from B.A.)"
" Masterpiece.
",2017-08-24 00:00:00,9,"For starters, let me express that all the events that take place in this film can happen in real life, this fact being very welcome and of course, unusual. Not short of this, the genre explored here is indeed scarce. This film invades the spectator with a feeling of uneasiness very difficult to describe by minute five. And far from relieving you from this uncanny feeling, it builds up more and more and more and more. By the hour, I just had to stop and switch my TV to a stupid channel in order to go to bed peacefully. But don't misunderstand me: if you see my reviews you'll find I'm a tough critic of unnecessary violence and gore. What you have here is a mounting tension like when you see huge amounts of snow in the mountain ladder and you know a huge avalanche is due. Some other reviewers (of this same film) call this ""predictable""; in my opinion they are completely mistaken. The avalanche is due, but you just don't know when and what it'll do. The nearest comparison I have at hand is a very old film starring Dustin Hoffman ""The Straw Dogs"", but it's just a poor comparison: ""The Distinguished Citizen"" is by far better and suspenseful. I watched the (almost) remaining half the next day and it just got better. Be warned, this film is better served for those who are emotionally sensitive: an idiot will just not notice that everything that goes on in this film is terribly wrong! I will end up saying that this is a class A film that deserves a place in the nominees for best foreign language films if not the Oscar. Highly recommended."
" Good as long as no expectations are imposed.
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,7,"Predictable, for sure, but there were quite a few funny moments throughout the film that managed to win me over. I commend the lead (Oscar Martínez)for the subtlety he brought to this role in order to make the part(and the situations)convincingly amusing. Understanding or navigating the nuances of a foreign culture, even when the culture is from one's own childhood, can be a tricky task."
" A masterpiece about art, the artist and the Latin American being
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,10,"Few movies have achieved to be as visceral and deep as this one. Without failing to keep your eyes on the screen until the last scene, besides making you laugh, panic and hold your breath countless times, A Distinguished Citizen questions the role of the artist, his ethics and his commitments. Mantovani, the main character, confronts his origins and his own creatures face to face, outside the artificiality of his new life as an European and a very well-succeeded writer. What comes from there is the source of his art emerging again: in the mediocrity of the Latin American little town's facts (and his repercussion on them), the whole system of art comes into question. Is the writer really able to stand for what he believes in and what has earned him a Noble prize? Should the artist violate real people in order to make his art relevant? This movie proves itself consistent with its plot by providing sturdy answers instead of falling into mere nihilism or sarcasm."
" Cheap and insulting
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,1,"A Nobel price winner writer; returns to his home small town after 40 years abroad, invited by the town to be declare a Distinguished Citizen. The guy is an skeptical whose motivation of life and people had completely wore off. Just in the first scene of the movie, when accepting the Nobel price he regrets it because the prize represents acceptance which somewhat means became one more. His town receives him as a hero but further events make the people start rejecting and disliking him. The idea; not too original has been already been made in many movies and novels; the most recent I remember was Jorge Amado Tieta do Agreste; but there must be many more. The problems are many; first of all; a few short monologues were written and recited to perfection by Oscar Martinez; but the whole movie seems to be an excuse to those parliaments creating very forced situations that are later contradicted in an intention to make the main character look better. The second problem is the attempt to create some kind of neo- realism; using non professional actors. The scenes look fake and sometimes embarrassing. The third problem is the depiction of a misery and abandon that is not quite real. Small towns have abandoned properties but are just a few and the also have nice house and people all over. The fourth is the insulting casting of small time people as dumb, with no artistic values or qualities and with a latent anger near to explode. Dady Brieva usually a reliable comedian; is used in a one dimensional character that do not exist more than the resented mind of this movie directors. I left Argentina 28 years ago but I travel at least 3 times a year to visit my family. I acknowledge many bad things happened and still happen; but this movie is not against the corrupt governments; is just an insult to people living day by day. Perhaps with no access to the culture in Buenos Aires or other big cities but are far from stupid and not bad at all.I believe the only bad people here are the two directors; making an easy coin out of insulting their own people but without the guts to criticize whatever is really wrong there."
" Delightful black comedy
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,8,"Black comedies are a difficult movie genre. They have to get the tone exactly right, otherwise they are either not funny enough or too much over the top. In this respect, 'El ciudadano ilustre' is perfect. It's understated enough to be subtle, and surreal enough to make you laugh. It has this quality in common with that other Argentinian surprise from three years ago, 'Relatos Salvajes'.'El ciudadano ilustre' is about a Nobel-prize winning author living in Spain, who decides to accept an invitation to become honorary citizen of his hometown, a sleepy backwater in the south of Argentina in which all of his novels are set. At first, it is unclear why he decides to accept this invitation, and only in the final minutes of the film this question is more or less answered. This nice twist at the end is the cherry on the cake.The author, used to being admired and praised everywhere he goes, has to adapt to the less sophisticated way of life in his hometown. Already during the drive from the airport, he is in for a surprise. The car breaks down in the middle of nowhere, and he is forced to tear his latest novel apart in order to use the pages for lighting a camp fire. It's symbolic for the lack of respect the local people have for his novels. Some of them are not extremely enthusiastic about the way their town is portrayed.His visit starts a series of unexpected events, in which art, sex, violence and local politics play a part. But the film's bizarre story line is not its only quality. Above all, it's the way the local community is shown. In one small scene, the author is sitting on a street bench when an old man appears from a nearby house to bring him a cup of the Argentinian drink 'mate'. He drinks in silence, returns the cup to the man, who re-enters the house. End of scene.'El ciudadano ilustre' is a wonderful film, highly recommended for anyone who likes understated humor and surreal situations."
" Oscar Martinez...
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,7,"Just saw the film with Osacr Martinez as a main character. And I found his perform really bad, for moments with a way to speak annoying and not credible at all.In the other hand I loved the character of Dady Brieva (Antonio), which was more difficult and subtle. I know that Oscar Martinez have a reputation as a good actor but I also saw him working in Wild Tales with the same impression.About the film itself I loved it because it was truly moving in the sens of the all kind of stereotypes that you can see and suffer when you are outside my country, Argentina. Plus with the particular character of the writer, full of himself and denying all his history. Worth to see it."
" Movie or try?
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,2,"I begin to see this film without knowing what I am going to see. Soon I begin to ask if this is a movie or what it is. That is an irony of something is clear. An irony of what? At no time did I sympathize with anything that happens in the film. I'm not interested at all. If it was a well-made criticism of artists, so-called culture, it would be fine, but maybe we should start by criticizing the film. It does not have any grace and the gags, for calling them, are simple and bland.The film is an ode to its main actor. I do not think there's a plane on which it does not come out. But the problem is that it's not that great either. I get bored listening to him.The photograph, to call it that way, does not exist. It looks like the work done by film students, who do something for the first time.The direction is very bad, does not know when you have footage left over. The planes are ugly. He constantly bores. It does not provoke laughter. And it falls into topics that I will explain.Spoiler:Not when he returns, the old bride, is the opposite of him. He is an uncultured person whom he kisses again but does not seduce him. Of course, she has a daughter, an artist, a bohemian and cultured. That as it does not go mad by the protagonist. Of course, the daughter is unfaithful to her boyfriend and goes to bed with the protagonist."
