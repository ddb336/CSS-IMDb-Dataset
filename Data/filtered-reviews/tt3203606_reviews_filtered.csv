" To be fair hollywood has changed a lot.
",2021-04-02 00:00:00,5,"While I am quite antisocialist, I do emphasize with its romantic ideals and would be against any type of fascistic action against them - as in the 1950s Hollywood and the US - so have the times changed that Hollywood is depicting socialism as good. Nevertheless, while its an interesting idea, the plot is dull."
" Perfect and Emotional
",2021-02-19 00:00:00,9,Well it's my first ever movie review and it's almost 6 years after release but the movie hooked me from start to end. Bryan Cranston acted brilliantly and Helen Mirren is good as always. The speech scene at the end for me was very emotional and sensitive.
" AMAZING!
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,9,"This was unexpectedly phenomenal. Cranston is of course the main star here, but Louis C.K. and John Goodman both give stellar side performances. Highly recommended to anyone wanting more insight on the infamous 'blacklist' days in Hollywood."
" Communism...seriously??
",2020-12-03 00:00:00,1,It tries to paint communism in a warm and caring light..if it were just a pure biography it would be much better. The acting is great but is ruined by the swayed political agenda this movie is trying to portray.
" Bryan Cranston shines...
",2020-12-02 00:00:00,7,"The Great Depression of 1930s followed by the World War II, the Hollywood strikes and the tensions between the Hollywood producers and the screenwriters... the rise and pervasion of communism within Hollywood.. a Hollywood blacklist was preapated and of which 10 aka the Hollywood 10 were subpoenaed to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). One of them was a screenwriter Dalton Trumbo. This is a biopic about him. Bryan Cranston delivers a brilliant performance as an eponymous protagonist and so is Diane Lane justifies her role as his wife. A great watch.."
" Superb acting
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,8,"And an interesting story based on real life result in a very good movie, although it could have been a bit shorter without losing any quality."
" Very good
",2020-09-19 00:00:00,8,"And the Oscar goes to... man this is a good movie. As a lover of film, this movie really appealed to me. Bryan Cranston kills it."
" Bryan Cranston totally nailed it. He looks perfect
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,6,I am not much of a communist supporter but I enjoyed the movie. It is really a well made movie but at the same time it seems bit of a biased. The only spectacular thing was that of Bryan Cranston screen presence and his talent. He totally owns the screen.
" WOW. Just WOW.
",2020-08-29 00:00:00,10,The storytelling is amazing. The Directing is outstanding. Bryan Cranston's performance is as always MIND BLOWING. He just owns the screen. Amazing.
" Bryan Cranston in an award-worthy performance
",2020-08-21 00:00:00,9,"Bryan Cranston gives a tour de force in his portrayal of black-listed screenwriter Dalton Trumbo. The movie portrays the era of Red-baiting in the late 1940s and into the 1950s in a dramatic and informative way and effectively demonstrates the genius, eccentricity, and humanity of Trumbo. The only disconcerting element is the fact that so many characters in the film portray real Hollywood personalities. It is hard not to focus on how well each actor resembles and mimics the movie legend being portrayed, such as Edwin G. Robinson, John Wayne, and Kirk Douglas. (Interestingly, to show how the Red Scare had petered out by the 1960s, when I went to see ""Spartacus"" as a freshman in college in 1961, the theater was being picketed by John Birch types. I and my fellow moviegoers just laughed at their claims of any subversive message in what was an excellent movie and which remains one of my all-time favorites.)"
" An important story but a lackluster film
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,6,Bryan Cranston was very good as Trumbo however the film just seemed to drag out. The storyline is important and I'm certainly glad the movie was made. Never outlaw ideas.
" Ironically it needed a Braver Writer
",2020-07-27 00:00:00,4,"Dalton Trumbo was both a highly talented and a highly successful Hollywood screenwriter and a communist who was jailed for not cooperating with the House Un-American Activities Committee during the early years of the Cold War and was blacklisted throughout the 1950s. This film tells his story - or rather part of it - through a sympathetic lens.
My criticism of the film is not so much what it contains as what it leaves out.
In 1938 Trumbo wrote an anti-war novel Johnny Got His Gun and serialized it in the communist paper, The Daily Worker, while the Hitler-Stalin Pact was in effect and while Trumbo adopted an isolationist policy. All this changed when Hitler invaded the Soviet Union. Not only did Trumbo prevent the book being reprinted during the war but he reported to the FBI some correspondents who used the horrors of Johnny to argue for peace with Nazi Germany.
Now this is a film about a man who in public refused to name names and argued against the state being able to inquire into people's unpopular but legitimate views but who had in private volunteered names of people with whose views he disagreed.
None of this is shown or even hinted at in this film.
We get a lot of clips of actual newsreels to place things in context but none about the horrors of communism. (Early on we get Trumbo explaining to his young daughter that communism is about sharing). I've read that Trumbo left the Communist Party in 1956, the year Stalin's successor admitted to some of Stalin's crimes and also the year Soviet tanks crushed the Hungarian Uprising.
Again, none of this is shown or even hinted at in this film.
There was a far better, more subtle, less hagiographical film to be made about Trumbo. Would the filmmakers have made a film about Washington or Jefferson without reminding us that they were slaveholders? I doubt it.
After a very weak opening 40 minutes - at which point I was wondering if I should consider continue watching it - the quality of the film improves beginning with the scene showing Trumbo's imprisonment.
The film is competently made and well-acted with Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje giving a particularly fine turn in a brief role.
If this was a work of fiction, I'd probably have given it a seven."
" Omits relevant history, makes a great point
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,8,"This is a very well made movie in spite of the fact that it omits relevant history, specifically the fact that Dalton Trumbo was intellectually inconsistent, rightly fighting for free speech for some, but turning others in to the government for speech he didn't like.Nevertheless, ""Trumbo"" is a terrific indictment of McCarthyism and blacklisting that's, intentionally or unintentionally, relevant to our times. Some people today who foolishly support cancel culture could and should take a lesson from this film before they suffer under the next needlessly punitive fad."
" Fantastic
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,8,"Story is told wonderfully. I loved the style of this film including the direction, music... After Breaking Bad and Bryan Cranston's subsequent popularity, it is difficult to understand, but I believe this film demonstrates how he is still hugely underrated as an actor. His performance here is soo good. He is eloquent and interesting at all times, driving this film and story forward. Fantastic film on an important moment in history. Would recommend to all."
" Against all odds
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,8,"So maybe you didn't know about Trumbo before this movie. And I personally didn't know about him specifically, but I was aware of the general situation. The ""witchhunt"", just it wasn't witches but ""communist traitors"". Being labelled that was a ""death sentence"". Sorry for putting so many things in quoting marks, I reckon I like that, because there is a deeper meaning to some of them. As is true with what is going on here. There is the obvious layer and the one you can find for yourself.Being treated the way Trumbo and others were treated is really hard to watch. For anyone who's in the slightest empathetic that is of course. Great performances and great actors make this really a movie to watch. And things depicted here happened one way or the other so ..."
" Simplistic and rushed script
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,2,"This movie seemed to be more of a labor of love by all concerned, rather than a serious attempt at a movie. Most of the supporting actors were faces not seen on the screen often, and I guess were able to donate their time readily to this supposed ""period piece"". The script is rushed and inspiration seemed to have come from ""cut and paste"" of various newspaper reports and events. The dialog is just stupid, and the acting weak in places. Cranston (I'm a fan) overacted to the point of being nauseating in the lead role. Most of the others did their roles and lines ""tongue in cheek"". Understandable with a rubbish script! This was really a waste of time."
" Fantastic
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,10,"An inexplicably delightful film portraying an egregious history of anger and ignorance. I like to think of myself as well read and do go out of my way to learn. But I'm 30 years old and I didn't, to this day, know to which the extent of invasiveness or abuse of power was reigned upon people, let alone celebrities so publicly. We weren't well educated on the details of the red scare in public schools and that is truly disturbing. (Of course there are many other things we weren't taught, specifically in the realm of miscarriages of justice.) This film was well made, acted, written and executed in total. Absolutely recommend."
" I really wanted to like this
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,1,"The good - A period piece where efforts on costume, production, and cinematography were well done. Casting was well done too. Cranston looked the part as most of the others.The Bad - Script was too gratuitous and simplistic. Trying to make a communist supporter sympathetic requires some depth and effort especially to an audience who 70 years later know the failures and evil which result of communism. His argument that communism is simply when his daughter shares her lunch at school. This was so bad and unbelievable. Even those seeking confirmation bias aren't that dumb. I felt like the producers were trying to manipulate me to be sympathetic but they didn't try hard at all.Further the acting was just too predictable and at times over the top. Cranston wasn't given enough dialogue to build up his actions which resulted in overacting and shallow scenes.Summary - the world isn't as black and white as this movie tried to push especially when trying to tackle a very difficult topic. Don't waste your time."
" Bomb!
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,1,"It's a fictional movie ""Fake News"" and they still couldn't make money... Why lie? Are people really this stupid?"
" Trumbo - Mesmerizing
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,9,"The performances in this film are outrageously good: Helen Mirren almost steals the film as Hedda Hopper, the witch who was a witch-hunter. Brian Cranston, of course, is outstanding in the lead role and deserved an Oscar. The good guys and bad guys do a nice job throughout the film, with Kirk Douglas and Otto Preminger coming off as heroes, John Wayne and Edward G Robinson as villains, and a host of others as moral cowards. The bullies like Hopper and McCarthy come off quite correctly as the buffoons they were in real life.It was interesting to see that Roman Holiday and The Brave One were written by Trumbo, but credited to others; while both won the Academy Award for best screenplay. I don't know if I agree with the generous observation by Trumbo that all of these people were victims, although there is a solid argument for that. I think that the film is topical in 2020, but we should all try to be a bit more tolerant."

",2020-05-22 00:00:00,10,Good morning thank you you for your time and today thank
" Brilliant
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,9,"With some excellent performances, a terrific screenplay, and some brilliant direction, Trumbo is a very underrated and notable delight that is as important as it is captivating. The film can be a bit slow natured at times, and feels a bit longer than it truly is throughout its nearly 2 hour runtime. However, despite these fallacies, Trumbo is laced with just enough impressive qualities to make for quite a unique joy. Bryan Cranston provides a terrific performance as the titular character, and is more than worthy of his Oscar nomination for best actor in a leading role. The supporting actors are quite impressive as well, with everyone providing some truly captivating roles and none at all seeming to phone it in. The film is very consistent, and full of a tight atmosphere and direction that truly propels it to be quite an impressive watch. The screenplay is graciously executed, and despite it being slow from time to time, there is no doubt that the writing is quite terrific. In the end, Trumbo has its standard pacing flaws, but nothing to truly compromise its daring nature. It's terrific performances and many other virtues throughout, lead it to be one of the best films of the year, and houses truly some of the best talent seen on the screen in the last decade.
My Rating: 9.5/10"
" Oh, how the times have changed...
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,3,"Instead of Hollywood blacklisting a communist-loving leftist for his political views, they are now communist-loving leftists blacklisting actors for their conservative political views and beliefs. Actors can't even come out and admit that they support someone like Donald Trump without suffering the wrath from the ""tolerant"" left that is liberal Hollywood. Of course you'll never see Hollywood make a movie about conservatives experiencing the same thing in this day and age. And why would they? Just look at how they succeeded in restricting a movie exposing the truth about Planned Parenthood to a few measly theaters. If it weren't for double standards, the left wouldn't have any.Pathetic."
" One part historical essay and one part chilling cautionary tale, its message is particularly pertinent now, amid the nonstop spin and opinionated
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,8,"An insider's perspective of the red scare, following the private trials and public persecutions of Oscar-winning screenwriter (and proud communist) Dalton Trumbo. It's one-sided, as you might expect, but serves as an intriguing glimpse into the might of effective media manipulation and its powerful ability to turn the tide of popular perception. Bryan Cranston plays the lead, and though he doesn't look all that much like the man behind the thick glasses and dense moustache, his intense, passionate self-defense and gravel-voiced delivery are impressive and convincing all the same. Louis CK, in an important supporting role, is less successful: he touches the necessary emotional points, but doesn't threaten to disappear into the part. He's just... Louis CK in a different set of clothes. One part historical essay and one part chilling cautionary tale, its message is particularly pertinent now, amid the nonstop spin and opinionated delivery of the modern-day news cycle. In time, Hollywood recognized its blacklist for the thin, short-sighted witch hunt it really was, but not before countless lives had been sacrificed in the name of some mythical greater good. What will we look back upon with similar regret tomorrow?"
" Bryan Cranston's talent has no bounds
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,8,"The black and white segments (a mix of original and imitation footage) were distracting and took me out of the movie at times, but the strong supporting cast led by the incredibly talented Bryan Cranston was enough to draw me back in every time. Malcolm in the Middle > Breaking Bad > Power Rangers > Trumbo... now that's range!"
" Engaging biography about talented screenwriter Dalton Trumbo who suffered extreme harassment for his communist ideas
",2019-12-20 00:00:00,7,"In 1947, Dalton Trumbo (Bryan Cranston) was Hollywood's top screenwriter until he and other great artists were harassed , chased and imprisoned . This movie recounts how Dalton used words and wit to win two Academy Awards , along the way being really blacklisted , which entangled everyone from arguably most powerfully anti-Communist gossip columnist Hedda Hopper (Dame Helen Mirren is terrific as the gossip columnist) to John Wayne (David James Elliott) . Being accsed by the comittee presided by senator J. Parnell Thomas (James DuMont) Finally , in 1960, Producer and actor Kirk Douglas (Dean O'Gorman) recruited him to write the screenplay for Spartacus (1960) and Otto Preminger (Christian Berkel) for Exodus . What followed next was a story about principles and how principles can make or break you . Are you now or have you ever been...When they tried to silence him, he made the world listen.Enjoyable and interesting biography about Dalton Trumbo and other artists who were jailed and blacklisted for their political beliefs. Exposing the absurdity and injustice under the blacklist, and how Trumbo was cruelly pursued and isolated by anti-communist pursuers .Good biography drama with sympathetic performances , social critical and a strong denounce against censorhip and the activities of the House Un-American Activities Committee . Main and support cast give magnificent interpretations , outstanding the great Brian Cranston , well accompanied by Diane Lane as his wife , Elle Fanning as his daughter , Helen Mirren as Hedda Hopper , Michael Stuhlbarg as Edward G. Robinson ,Ian McLellan Hunter , Alan Tudyk , Roger Bart as Buddy Ross , Louis C.K. as Arlen Hird , David James Elliott as John Wayne , John Getz as Sam Wood , John Goodman as Frank King , Stephen Root as Hymie King , among others. the motion picture was professionally directed by Jay Roach who has produced and directed some successes as Dinner for Schmucks , Blown away , Meet the Fockers and its sequel , Austin Powers trilogy , The Campaign , among others .This agreeable and though-provoking flick was well based on actual and historical events about Trumbo and his people , there are the following ones : By the late 1940s, he was considered one of Hollywood's rising young writing talents, but his career was interrupted by the activities of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), a congressional committee that employed ruthless tactics aimed at rooting out and destroying what it saw as Communist influence in Hollywood. A lifelong political leftist who had been a Communist Party member briefly during World War II, he was one of the so-called ""Hollywood Ten"" who refused to cooperate with HUAC and had their careers disrupted or ruined as a result. The committee threw him in prison for refusing to cooperate, and after having spent several months behind bars . Similarly happened to Edward Dmytryck , but he decided to cooperate after all, and testified again before the committee, this time giving the names of people he said were Communists. He claimed to believe he had done the right thing, but many in the Hollywood community--even those who came along long after the committee was finally disbanded--never forgave him, and that action overshadowed his career the rest of his life.After his blacklisting and failure of the Hollywood 10's appeals, the Trumbo family exiled themselves to Mexico. In Mexico, chain-smoking in the bathtub in which he always wrote, usually with a parrot given to him by 'Kirk Douglas' perched on his shoulder, Trumbo wrote approximately thirty scripts under pseudonyms and using fronts who relayed the money to him. His works included the film noir classic Gun Crazy (1950) , co-written under the pseudonym Millard Kaufman, Oscar-winning Roman Holiday (1953) (with screenwriter Ian McLellan Hunter as a front), and Court-martial of Billy Mitchell (1955)."
" the man, the moustache, the legend
",2019-12-08 00:00:00,7,"The real star here is the fake moustache which Bryan Cranston unwisely hired instead of growing one: getting bigger, smaller, lighter, darker, appearing to creep about his face when no-one's looking, it upstages him at every turn. As for the supporting player, Cranston himself, his performance is effective at a certain level; but it makes the whole thing seem faintly ludicrous, like the Coens' Hail Caesar. He just isn't a good enough actor to suffer convincingly (his family are much better, especially the little girl). But the rest of the cast is good, it's an interesting story (if spun out a little too long), and fun to see Hollywood giants like John Wayne and Kirk Douglas dragged into the action."
" Dalton Trumbo, the saint of Hollywood
",2019-11-23 00:00:00,6,"Dalton Trumbo was by the end of the forties about the most succesfull screenwriter in Hollywood but also an active member of the communist party and a big supporter of Stalin. When the HUAC starts its hearings he is ofcourse one of the first to be targeted and indeed found guilty, as one of the infamous Hollywood Ten, put in jail (but only for 10 months) and upron release can't find a job so starts to work on B-movies but prevails in the end with winning two oscars and writing the screenplay for ""Spartacus"".As a classic moviebuff I quite liked the movie, especially to find out how all these actors would be portrayed : Kirk Douglas and Otto Preminger are spot-on, John Wayne so-and so but the Edward Robinson part is a joke, played by an actor who looks at least 20 years younger then the real Robinson at the time.But let's face it : this is an almost Ghandi-like haghiography by today's liberal leftleaning Hollywood. Cranston does an OK job : he portrrays Trumbo as rather grumpy but lovable family man who only cares on the fact that also his stricken colleagues get some work. There is even one who has cancer. He also lives in a grand mansion (as a real commie) but which he ofcourse has to leave when things get rough and then has to movie to a house in the suburbs (how terrible).Anyway, if you are supporting for a country that is in deadlocks with your own country on about everything (definitely in the fifties) you might consider piping down a bit, especially on the First Amendment thing, something that is rather missing in the Soviet Union legal handbook."
" A reminder of the sa nationort of collective madness that can envelop
",2019-10-25 00:00:00,8,This is an excellent film. It sticks largely to the facts (one variation is that Trumbo and his family relocated to Mexico rather than staying in LA as is implied by the film). It is generally well-acted and very well-scripted. There are a few 'stereotypical' scenes early on but some of the speeches are excellent. I'd recommend it highly.
" Half-Truths
",2019-08-08 00:00:00,2,"Helen Mirren, Bryan Cranston and Diane Lane are good reasons to see any film, but this film is so mealy-mouthed -- it wants to fudge that Trumbo was, after all, a member of the Communist Party -- that it is offensive to truth and history."
" my notes
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,6,"Good movie with a very interesting story that I enjoyed learning about. It was nice to see Brian Cranston playing a completely different character than Walter White, and he definitely did an outstanding job. I found myself rooting for him (1 viewing)

It was also cool seeing some of the history of Hollywood which I enjoyed as you might guess based on how much I love movies"
" Treachery, troubles, tribulations and Trumbo
",2019-06-12 00:00:00,8,"I have lately been reading up on and listening to a lot of podcasts on the Blacklist and so inevitably came to this recent biopic of screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, whose eventual accredited work at the end of the 50's on the major films ""Spartacus"" and ""Exodus"" is generally accepted as effective proof that the Blacklist had at last been broken.Starring Bryan Cranston in the title role as the charismatic, principled writer, it tells his rise, fall and rise again story amongst those of many others in the era, so positing the contrasting points of view and political stances taken by many of his contemporaries, many of them famous, during this troubled time in American history.No one film can take in all of the different stories and nuance all the different shades of opinion of the day and so this one concentrates its focus on major characters such as of course Trumbo but also his fellow travellers such as left-leaning actor Edward G Robinson, fellow banned writer Ian McLellan Hunter and the opportunist low-budget film producers the King Brothers who took advantage of the sudden availability of quality writers at cut-price rates to churn out screenplays either uncredited or under pseudonyms for their trashy but profitable low-budget features. Railed against Trumbo and his cohorts on the side of the House of Un-American Committee are numbered the influential harridan gossip columnist Hedda Hopper and Mr American Hero himself, John Wayne, although on both sides I didn't understand or approve of the use of fictional composite characters like Arlen Hird, standing in for important individual writers like Albert Maltz, Alvah Bessie, Lester Cole, John Howard Lawson and Samuel Ornitz or major studio producer Buddy Ross for Dore Schary and Walter Wanger. Whilst I understand the need to reduce the headcount in telling a story involving so many different people, I still felt that this downplayed and ultimately denigrated the contributions of important individuals, especially that of Maltz who completely disagreed with the forgiving tone of Trumbo's valedictory speech in 1970 at the end of the film while accepting an important industry award where he exonerates his accusers in the same sentence as their victims.Anyway, putting verisimilitude to one side, difficult as that maybe in such a representation of history, the film certainly gripped and entertained from start to finish. It showed Trumbo as the swimming-pool radical he was, happy to espouse Communist views even as he lived a luxurious lifestyle with his wife and young family and didn't flinch from showing his own dramatic fall from grace particularly when he is incarcerated in prison, his only comfort being that this ironically turns out to be shared with his also now imprisoned main accuser, disgraced H.U.A.C. leader J Parnell Thomas. I certainly savoured Trumbo's withering put-down of Thomas when they meet inside that at least Thomas was behind bars for actually committing a crime (tax evasion), almost as much as his riposte to the hectoring bluster of all-American Wayne by asking him where he served during the war.Cranston is excellent as Trumbo, highlighting the man's contradictions but ultimately the courage of his convictions as well as his crankiness towards his supportive but neglected family unit. The sense of time and place is effectively rendered with fine cinematography and a subtle jazz-flavoured soundtrack.The film I believe pretty accurately portrayed the events of the time and while of necessity telescoping events for the sake of brevity, nevertheless shed further light on a disgraceful episode in the entertainment industry of the time. If nothing else, it made me re-appraise my opinion of till now one of my favourite Golden Age Hollywood actors Edward G Robinson. Wayne's hypocrisy, on the other hand, I was well aware of."
" Damn good movie that should've won the Oscar a couple years ago!
",2019-05-20 00:00:00,8,"Very well done flick, although some parts rubbed me the wrong way like (Dalton) Bryan Cranston being selfish about his work during his daughter's birthday and the meanness towards Louis C.K.'s character, otherwise an outstanding movie! Great cast - I love most of the actors & it's well written not much more to say except it's art!"
" Very Well-Constructed... Solid
",2019-05-08 00:00:00,8,Very well-constructed story with clever use of authentic & re-created footage; the acting is solid & engaging - it didn't take long for me to forget I was watching Bryan Cranston & believe I was watching Dalton Trumbo himself.
" Beautifully written
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,7,"Beautifully written by John McNamara, from the book by Bruce Cook. A fitting tribute to Dalton Trumbo and to all those writers who were blacklisted.I'd expected to find this boring (and so was ready to give it 15 minutes before abandoning it), but I was captivated by a portrait of a man who demanded his rights. Nothing brash about it. Balanced in showing the ""baddies"" as flawed, rather than straight-out malicious, individuals.From a political perspective, the lesson is probably that for every complex problem (e.g. The Cold War), there is a solution (e.g. the blacklist) which is both simple and wrong. Unfortunately, this is a lesson we seem fated never to learn."
" The Front
",2019-04-07 00:00:00,6,"The 1990 BBC film; Fellow Traveller was a story of an American screenwriter who flees to England to escape the McCarthy witch-hunts in America. He gets a job working for adventure shows in the burgeoning ITV network under a pseudonym just like several other American writers who fled across the pond..Trumbo has a similar theme. Dalton Trumbo (Bryan Cranston) was a real life writer but he did not get the luxury to come over to Britain. He ended up in jail, he and some of his associates were blacklisted thanks to gossip columnists such as Hedda Hopper (Helen Mirren) baying for the blood of reds under the beds.Once released and in order to feed his family, he ends up writing films which were fronted by other writers. Ian McLellan Hunter won an Oscar for Roman Holiday for a film that Trumbo actually wrote.There is a good scene in the film where Trumbo who actually fought in the war challenges John Wayne as to what combat he saw outside of a Hollywood studio.Even though based on true events, Trumbo takes some liberties with the truth. It has composite characters and Edward G Robinson never named people in the way it is depicted here.Director Jay Roach better known for Austin Powers and Meet the Parents movies turns serious but Trumbo has an air of a glorified television movie about it. It is well acted by Cranston and Mirren but the second half comes across like a melodrama with Trumbo's family issues.The blacklist effectively ended when Kirk Douglas credited Trumbo as the writer for the film, Spartacus.Commentators said never again about McCarthyism, underestimating that conservatives, far right, alt right just regrouped not retreat. They quickly returned to silence people for other reasons for having opinions they did not like.If Hedda Hopper was alive now, she would be calling out for Social Justice Warriors and Snowflakes to be silenced and at the same time complain that conservatives are being discriminated against.Trumbo needed sharper anger and reflect on what is going on today."
" Bryan Cranston: Great American Actor!
",2019-02-02 00:00:00,10,"Flat out Bryan Cranston is one of the great actors of our day! No other actor has covered so much ground successfully. None. Malcolm in the Middle to Breaking Bad to epic film work like Trumbo. We can all remember him as Tim Whatley on Seinfeld or Doug Heffernan's next door neighbor. Brilliant. But here, Trumbo, he has accomplished true greatness. If you you tube Dalton Trumbo the cadence and timing of Cranston is impeccable. He carries this movie on his back and dwarfs the great Helen Mirren and John Goodman and all the others. Easily an Oscar performance...end of story!"

" communism in hollywood
",2018-11-21 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you what Hollywood was really like back in the day. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" This may have been based on a true story but it is totally fiction
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,3,"In the scene where trumbo talks to his daughter on the horse and it test her on whether she's a communist or not makes it sound like voluntarily sharing her sandwich makes her communist. I'm sorry but communism is not voluntary the government steals it from you and then gives it out as they see fit, if they see fit."
" Serious issue on comedic mood
",2018-11-06 00:00:00,7,I will waiting for this movie to be remake into more serious concept. I'm not say this movie is not good. But sometimes you got a feeling that something serious is needed for this kind serious and important matter. Hint: not everybody is have luck like Trumbo got on that period.
" Alright
",2018-10-22 00:00:00,7,"Trumbo was passable and decent to watch. It served as a reasonable and interesting historical film. However like many other historical films it does not go beyond capturing historical events on film. Much like Mandela featuring Idris Alba and other films it shows events but it never quite reaches the level of creating moments or something that jumps out of the history book. Whether its a stellar performance, killer soundtrack, unique scene, directing and writing or a combination Trumbo is nothing more than a history lesson. We see what happens and we close the book. It does not go beyond like the Kings Speech where the story jumps out of the book."
" A Man Called Trumbo, And A Blacklist Called UGLY
",2018-09-04 00:00:00,10,"During World War II, both the United States and the Soviet Union were basically on the same side, fighting the fascism of Hitler and Mussolini. But once that war was won, a new war began-between the two former allies. By the late 1940s, there was hysteria sweeping America that there was a Soviet spy or somebody with Communist persuasions under everyone's bed; and that hysteria escalated to paranoia when it reached Hollywood. Anyone in the movie industry, be they writers, actors, directors, or craftspeople, were basically purged from Hollywood if they were found out to have had any connections to Communism, and were put on a morally ugly blacklist. The biggest fish of all among Hollywood screenwriters was Dalton Trumbo, who was an admitted Communist only because he led the fight for equal pay for workers in Hollywood. His story was told quite brilliantly in the 2015 biopic TRUMBO.Based on Bruce Cook's bio, TRUMBO stars Bryan Cranston stars as Trumbo, whose refusal to answer questions about his membership to the onerous House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947 led him and other writers to be blacklisted, even as some of their fellow Hollywood colleagues turned on Trumbo and others to cover their own asses and save their careers from certain disaster. Cheerleading the ""Good Fight"" against ""Godless"" communists were Hollywood gossip columnist Hedda Hopper (Helen Mirren) and screen icon John Wayne (David James Elliott), who at the height of his career was a major cheerleader for our troops in World War II but who, unlike many of his fellow actors, both Communists and non-Communists alike, did not put money where his mouth was and fight in that war. Cranston spends a couple of years in jail; but even when he is released, he notices that the Hollywood blacklist is still very much alive and well into the early 1950s; and with the ascendancy of unsavory political hacks like Joe McCarthy and Richard Nixon, may be even worse than before. As a result, he becomes a workaholic of the highest order, trying to get back into the business that abandoned him by writing screenplays under pseudonyms (which a lot of Hollywood personas did during that time), but alienating himself from his wife (Lane) and kids. Eventually, however, under the pseudonym ""Robert Rich"", he wins a screenwriting Oscar for 1955's THE BRAVE ONE; and then both Otto Preminger (Christian Berkel) and Kirk Douglas (Dean Gorman) come to him with screenwriting offers (which led to SPARTACUS and EXODUS getting made), bringing him back to prominence.Jay Roach, known for, among other things, the 2012 made-for-cable political drama GAME CHANGE, and screenwriter John McNamara show the corrosive effect that the Hollywood blacklist had on the industry, not just Trumbo, but for fellow travelers (portrayed by, among others, Louis C.K., John Getz, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Alan Tuduk), and those who turned in their supposed friends. The whole atmosphere of paranoia, hysteria, and overcooked anti-Communist hate is masterfully shown with much footage of the HUAC hearings and many other Hollywood stars who got caught up in it all, including Robert Taylor (who is seen to say, ""If I had my way, they'd all be sent back to Russia""). Elliott, who had been on the CBS military drama JAG in the 1990s, while he doesn't look too much like ""The Duke"", does give a solid, strapping performance, at least in speaking mannerisms, of the rabidly anti-Commie Wayne, while Mirren is deliciously slimy as the equally anti-Commie gossip columnist legend Hopper.It is, however, Cranston's cutting performance as Hollywood's most famous blacklisted writer that truly stands out. He so captures much of Trumbo's biting mordant wit and sarcasm, both at his enemies and, more painfully, at his family. His choking and halting speech about the blacklist, where he admits that no heroes or villains came out of it, only a lot of victims, at the Laurel Awards in L.A. in March 1970 is among the most compelling moments of the film, because it clearly depicts Trumbo as having always been a man of deep principles who fought for equality at a time in America where conformity was not only the norm, but it was practically forced on everyone, and when those who didn't were automatically deemed either Commies or fellow travelers. This is something that the America of the second decade of the 21st century can learn in the age of right-wing autocracies."
" More Substance Than Style
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,7,"Based on a true story: Dalton Trumbo (played by Bryan Cranston) was a successful Hollywood screenwriter who was persecuted and blacklisted in 1947 due to his ties with the American Communist party.There are numerous movies that have a lot of style but not enough substance. ""Trumbo"" is a rare exception in that it goes in the opposite direction. The well-known situation is always rich material. Sadly, the script and directing are relatively bland, making the film seem more like a made-for-TV movie.The performances range from great to underused to miscast.Cranston takes on the main role (and the weight of the film) beautifully. It is worth noting that Trumbo, like his colleagues, supported Communist ideals (like treating workers fairly) but were not allied with the Soviet Union . Cranston easily conveys the deep character of someone who cantankerously sticks to his good ideals despite harsh odds.As Trumbo's wife, the talents of Diane Lane seem underused in a rather ordinary role. Helen Mirren brings her usual magic as the contemptible Hedda Hooper but the character is one-dimensional (yes, I know that is to be expected of a nasty gossip columnist). Rather than a full-fledged performance, it seems to be more a series of occasional cameos. As Edward G. Robinson, Michael Stuhlbarg is good but seems too laid-back for someone who was feisty and energetic on-screen. Luckily, John Goodman is fiery and hilarious as cheap-budget producer with energy to burn.While the movie is mixed in its delivery, the material makes it worth seeing."
" Cranston trumps
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,8,"Trumbo is a very good, interesting biopic of Dalton Trumbo. The best thing about the film is Bryan Cranstons portrayal of the main character. His mannerisms and facial expressions are particularly memorable. The supporting cast are strong. John Goodmans character is particularly captivating, but Trumbos eldest daughter is very strong. Helen Mirren is defnitealy the weakest thing about this film. She doesnt manage to carry the same amount of confidence and elegance as she has done in similar previous roles. I actually kept on forgetting about her character during the film as she just didnr have any prescene about her in her few scenes. The plot is interesting but it is portrayed in a very straightforward manner, as are the other aspects of the film. It is a film about screenwriting and behind the scenes work at Hollywood, but it is really the actors and actresses who steal the show. Its a good film for anyone interested. 8/10"
" A Bit of Irony.
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,8,"Bryan Cranston's performance as Dalton Trumbo is superb, (even though he figured out a way to characteristically show off his nude physique.) The supporting cast is also excellent, especially Diane Lane and Elle Fanning as members of his ill-used and neglected family. The cinematography is quite good, with perfect production design. But the notion that communists somehow believed themselves to be defenders of free speech demonstrates the foolishness of the progressive left. Under any real communist government, they would simply have become unpersons or been shot for advocating freedom of expression."
" What the imagination can't conjure, reality delivers with a shrug.
",2018-07-13 00:00:00,10,"Dalton Trumbo was an Academy Award winning screenwriter who was blacklisted in Hollywood during the McCarthy years. Bryan Cranston was well-honored with an Academy Award nomination for his performance as the smart-mouthed screenwriter. Diane Lane played his long-suffering wife, Cleo, who supports him. Dame Helen Mirren was perfect as Hedda Hopper actress turned gossip queen. The film has a stellar cast such as Roger Bart, John Goodman and Louis C.K. The actors who played Kirk Douglas and John Wayne were perfect with their voices and appearance. The film was well-done and well-deserved to tell a forgotten story. I would like to see Dalton Trumbo get a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Motion Pictures posthumously."
" A GREAT STORY BUT DESTROYED BY BRYAN CRANSTON
",2018-06-11 00:00:00,4,I am extremely engrossed my Hollywood 10 movies since especially considering the current political situation . Started watching this and became entranced by the story but at 1 hour i just could not take the unlikable actor playing Trumbo. They should redo it with a real human being.
" ""There are many angry and ignorant people in the world and they seem to be breeding in record numbers"".
",2018-05-18 00:00:00,8,"Cranston is a magnetic on screen presence and Mirren is surprisingly vile, great of course, but truly vile. I'd wondered why I'd not heard of this fellow. That he wrote most of his best stuff (including Spartacus) under pseudonyms having being pushed out of Hollywood due to his politics explains a lot. It's not all dark though, in fact it's all delivered quite pleasantly, with plenty of humour. Not least with Trumbo squaring up defiantly against the John Wayne character in a particularly amusing scene. I've no idea what The Duke was like in real life, but here he's painted a little bit like Charlton Heston, a gun toting good ol boy. It's a scene of brain against brawn, intelligence verses paranoia. It may be a slightly bleak story, but blimey if it's not great!"
" This bio-pic struggles to balance its core themes and its real-life story, but is occasionally entertaining.
",2018-04-23 00:00:00,6,"The story itself isn't made apparent until around an hour in and even then there's not a clear through-line as 'Trumbo (2015)' tries to balance its bio-pic sensibilities with its apparently moralistic central ethic. The problem with this is that it's never made properly clear what the main message of the flick is - whether it be to support freedom of speech, to oppose the blacklist that plagued some screenwriters in the 40s and 50s or even to just outright condone the protagonist's communist ideologies. There's also an unbalanced and uncomfortable combination of composite and real-life characters that not only offsets the credibility of the piece but also downright calls into question its intent. The relatively unfocused feature is a little too baggy for its own good, too. The performances are all decent, if occasionally a little pantomime, though and there's some entertainment to be had throughout. It's just a tad ironic that it could've used a tighter screenplay. 6/10"
" Did ""Roman Holiday"", ""The Brave One"" ""Spartacus"" and ""Exodus"" Really Have Communist Subtexts to Overthrow the US Government?
",2018-04-01 00:00:00,9,"Towards the end of the film, Dalton Trumbo (Bryan Cranston in an Academy Award-nominated performance) makes a profound statement during his acceptance speech for the Laurel Award for Screen Writing Achievement during a Writer's Guild of America ceremony (1970). He says (paraphrase) ""It will do no good to search for villains or heroes or saints or devils because there were none; there were only victims (during the communist blacklist years of the 1940's and 1950's)."" This part of his speech sums up well the point of this film which chronicles one of the few survivors of the communist blacklist scare during the two decades after the Second World War. Not only teachers, doctors, academics, factory workers, social workers and many others were targeted resulting in the devastation of careers and lives, but also people working in the entertainment industry in Hollywood, CA.Few congressional committees in Post-World War Two United States were more un-American than the House Un-American Activities Committee and the Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security. The latter saw the rise of Sen. Joseph McCarthy's witch-hunts in which he accused people both within the US government and without but among the US citizenry as being communists in collusion with the then Soviet Union (USSR). As a result of these witch-hunts, friends turned on friends, usually fearing the wrath of the committee. If you didn't cooperate, the ""scarlet letter"" of communist or communist sympathizer was forever plastered onto you like a badge of shame. In addition, you might spend time in prison for being in contempt of congress. In the case of Dalton Trumbo, he experienced both indignities.Dalton Trumbo was one of the most brilliant screenwriters of his era. He wrote such classics as ""A Guy Name Joe"", ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"", ""Roman Holiday"", and even the b-film noire ""Gun Crazy"". He also wrote the screenplays to two great Hollywood epics: ""Spartacus"" and ""Exodus"". Despite his credentials, he was subpoenaed by the House Un-American Activities Committee to testify about whether he was or had been a member of the Communist Party. Many of his Hollywood friends were also subpoenaed, some were sympathetic to the cause of rooting out ""communists"" while others who were appalled at the committees' actions but terrified of being blacklisted reluctantly cooperated. Prominent members of the entertainment community including Edward G. Robinson, John Wayne, and Ronald Reagan were brought before the committee. Trumbo was no exception. Will he cooperate or risk losing his career?A brilliant film with a tour-de-force performance by Cranston as Trumbo. Trumbo is not always the easiest of characters to like. He sometimes sacrifices the needs of his family to maintain his career. Cranston finds the difficult balance of finding the humanity of Trumbo while also exposing his many shortcomings, including writing in the bathtub! Trumbo was a brilliant writer who didn't deserve his treatment at the hands of the US government. At the same time, his family didn't deserve what they suffered either. As stated earlier, there were no victors but only victims."
" The Rich Communist dilemma
",2018-02-19 00:00:00,4,"This is a well-meaning, entertaining enough movie which informs, but doesn't really stir one's emotions - and it should. Really, really should for we are talking about The Hollywood Ten here: therefore we are also talking about suppression of civil rights in the era of McCarthyism.Who would have ever guessed all those years ago, when laughing at the hysterical silliness of an Austin Powers movie, that its director afterwards would turn his interest in the recent political history of the U.S.? For the sixty-year-old Jay Roach, Trumbo is the fourth political movie, and the first made for the silver screen. Trumbo is quite obviously meant to be Roach's magnum opus, and while he is very adept at keeping things moving on, Trumbo fails to deliver.It is a movie worth seeing, and the reason is the crystal clear way it presents (or digests) history. It's good to know these things. Even better would be to actually feel them, like The Front and Good Night, And Good Luck. did. But Roach, in his quest to inform and entertain, shys away from the uncomfortable. Case in point: Trumbo is shown sentenced to prison, which feels almost like a vacation. And death - the result of the atrocities of HUAAC for many - is never shown, only mentioned. Roach keeps a tidy distance.Even the entertainment value is lowered with some of the casting choices. David Elliott is the most ludicrous John Wayne ever put on film, not looking or sounding like the man. Michael Stuhlbarg's Ed G. Robinson also doesn't sound at all like the real deal, so how can one relate? On the other hand, Dean O'Gorman fares pretty well as Kirk Douglas just by demonstrating a singular determination. Helen Mirren is very good as the despisable Hedda Hopper.But of the supporting players, it's John Goodman as the trash producer Frank King who really gives the film some spark. Trumbo is at its best when telling about the unique relationship with the King Brothers and the blacklisted writers. These are the most energetic scenes of the movie, and the amazing King's are clearly worthy of a movie of their own.Bryan Cranston makes a fine Dalton Trumbo (although even he doesn't grasp the real McCoy's voice), but the Oscar nomination was a bit much.Austin Powers and the Fockers made Jay Roach a rich man. Like Dalton Trumbo, Roach is now trying to make something substantial with his fortune. Considering his fine tv movies, he hasn't fared half-badly, but the dilemma stands as it stood in front of Trumbo: can you really live the life of the entitled and at the same time criticize the system that enables entitlement?"
" What do you know about communism?
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,9,I wouldn't think this film anything less than an inspirational true story of a real-life hero. The failures of democracy in a country proclaiming everything about freedom shows the irony.
" Worth the wait and makes me want to know more about this time period
",2017-12-23 00:00:00,9,"This film has triggered my need to locate and borrow a book or two about the Hollywood blacklist so that I can learn more about it and possibly gain an alternate view of the events of the film. I had some knowledge of the blacklist prior to seeing Trumbo, mostly because of all my reading of various Lucille Ball-oriented books and just seeing little blurbs here and there this horrible period in Hollywood history. This film told the story of screenwriter Dalton Trumbo. Trumbo was one of the infamous ""Hollywood Ten,"" the group of men who refused to answer questions to the House of Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) about their alleged involvement in the Communist Party. These men were all jailed for contempt of congress. They were also blacklisted by Hollywood studios. The only way for Trumbo to work was to write screenplays and get non-blacklisted friends to put their names on Trumbo's work and submit the screenplays to the studios. Trumbo and his friend would split the proceeds under the table. Later, Trumbo would use pseudonyms for his work. Later, he and his other blacklisted screenwriter friends found work writing bad B movies and submitting the screenplays under a wide array of pseudonyms. Trumbo's blacklist ended when Kirk Douglas and Otto Preminger approached him with their respective films (Spartacus and Exodus) and stated that they would put Trumbo's real name on their film.I hadn't realized that John Wayne and Hedda Hopper were such prominent figures in the Hollywood division of the HUAC's witch hunt. I also didn't know that Edward G. Robinson's career was affected by his affiliation with Trumbo and the other Hollywood Ten. I also found it disappointing that Robinson snitched on the Hollywood Ten by naming names, but then I imagine that the pressure not to become an ""unperson"" via blacklist was overwhelming.Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Trumbo was excellent. Were it not Leonardo DiCaprio's year to win the Oscar, Cranston's performance was worthy of an Oscar. While I'm not too knowledgeable on the real Dalton Trumbo, I would fully believe he was like Cranston's portrayal. It seemed very realistic. Cranston really went the full nine yards in capturing Trumbo's true persona. Helen Mirren made a perfect ruthless Hedda Hopper. Diane Lane was also effective as Trumbo's wife Cleo. Finally, John Goodman was hilarious as the studio boss who ran the bad B movie studio. Goodman's character didn't care what the film was, he just wanted some lightweight, ridiculous fluff that he thought he could exploit and make a quick buck off of it.My only complaint about this film is the casting of the actors who portrayed John Wayne and Edward G. Robinson. They didn't look or sound anything like the original actors. They didn't even try to do impressions of those performers. I thought the actor playing Kirk Douglas wasn't too bad. At least he somewhat looked like Douglas.I'd highly recommend this one."
" This movie about a man's struggles as a writer is engaging, compelling and just plain entertaining, highly recommend.
",2017-12-01 00:00:00,8,"This movie is important. It tells the story of the struggles faced by the people who sought to have a differing political view in the 1950s and 60s. Their decision to think differently left them facing prejudice and hatred in America. This is the focus of this movie.The story follow Dalton Trumbo, portrayed by Brian Cranston,a successful screenwriter in Hollywood in the 1950s. Cranston carries this movie on the shoulders of his performance. It is truly phenomenal how he brings such life and energy to this character. He captured my attention anytime he was on-screen and is without a doubt one of the major reasons you should see this movie.If you are a fan of any of Cranstons previous works you should love this movie for that reason alone. Cranston was nominated for an Oscar for this performance, a nomination I believe was well deserved.The movie is of course based on a true story. while I cannot attest to the validity of the facts, I can confidently say that anyone interested in this period of history will find this movie much more enjoyable then reading a Wikipedia page.Overall I give Trumbo 8/10 for its compelling plot and excellent performances. i would highly recommend it."
" An Overwhelmingh Historical Tale
",2017-11-24 00:00:00,8,"I happened only 70 years ago and so many young people have never even heard about it. How can it be? And, how dangerous. Not to know will always put you at a disadvantage, oh yes, sooner or later. Trumbo feels like a story set in a totalitarian Country and yet...The spread of fear is a powerful weapon used by self-aggrandizing sociopaths. Joe McCarthy's success is still a mystery to me and Trumbo proves, in the most riveting way, how easily we can fall in that trap. Bryan Cranston is simply, sensational portraying a true American in all its contradictions. I never really thought of the actual degradation Trumbo and the other blacklisted writers went through until I saw it in Bryan Cranston's face. David James Elliott portrayal of John Wayne is chilling and disturbing, specially because id true. I've heard from people who knew him, what a nice man Duke was and yet...Helen Mirren as Hedda Hopper was another chilling and unexpected portrait of utter ignorance. I've only recently found out that she was behind the forces that wanted Charles Chaplin out of the Country. Congratulations to director Jay Roach and to a spectacular cast. Let's hope everyone pays attention."
" Bryan Cranston owns the screen
",2017-10-18 00:00:00,8,"All movie fans should recognize the name of Dalton Trumbo. Even if his heyday was a good half-century ago, his actions during one of Hollywood's very darkest periods still have tremendous impact even today. Especially today, for that matter.Some quick background. You may recall that in World War II, the US and the Soviets were allies but that after the war we became distrustful adversaries. This time was known as the Cold War – since the two countries didn't fight one another – and really ended only in the late 1980s. Prior to the end of WW II, many Americans joined the Communist Party as a way to fight the rise of Fascism in Europe. After the war, current and former members of the Party were looked upon as pariahs of the highest order. Screenwriter Dalton Trumbo (Bryan Cranston) was one of these pariahs. It didn't help that he actively tried to rally technical workers on film sets (grips, lighting and sound technicians) to strike for higher pay. Unionizing was seen as a bad thing, despite the gains it had achieved for American workers earlier in the century.Trumbo's membership in the Party wasn't a big deal at first, but then gossip columnist Hedda Hopper (Helen Mirren), who wielded an enormous amount of power in Hollywood, took it as a personal affront and used her column (and weekly appearance in newsreels) to denounce Communism in general and Trumbo in particular. Kicking the whole scandal into high gear was a little-known congressional group – the House Un-American Activities Committee. These guys tried to rout out Commies from Hollywood (which it saw as holding a lot of sway over Americans, much more so than today) by calling a group of known or suspected Communists to Washington for sworn testimony. These men were known as the Hollywood Ten. Trumbo was one of them, and he refused to tell the committee the names of anyone else who was or who could be a Communist. He, like his fellow Ten members, was found in contempt. Later, someone not in the group did name Trumbo, and he was put in prison for a full year.When he got out, no one would hire him (or any of the others in the Ten). Except for King Brothers Studio, which couldn't pay him much. But Trumbo worked fast as both a writer of original stuff and a fixer of existing scripts. The Kings loved him. So much so that the others in the Ten were offered jobs (for no credit, same as Trumbo) working as script doctors. During this time, Trumbo also got work from some friendly sorts in the business by selling them a script but not taking on-screen credit; the credit typically went to a fictitious person, or to a willing accomplice – known as a front. Through this method, Trumbo won two writing Oscars – although no one knew it at the time.Dalton Trumbo fought for himself, his fellow writers, and for anyone for whom the Bill of Rights holds any meaning. He reasoned that if people could be silenced for political beliefs, then anyone could be silenced for any reason. This is, unfortunately, still true today. And although he didn't receive credit at the time, Trumbo was awarded his Oscars eventually (one posthumously). He's recognized as being one of the very greatest screenwriters the world has ever known. The movie does a terrific job describing Trumbo's struggles – and that of his family: his wife Cleo (Diane Lane) and his three doting children. The toll that his stance took on them was noticeable to everyone except for Trumbo himself.Cranston turns in what was an Oscar-nominated performance, but his was not the only one of note. Lane is superb as his suffering, strong better half. Elle Fanning, as his eldest daughter, is also a standout, as are John Goodman (as Frank King) and Alan Tudyk (as writer Ian McLellan Hunter). Spellbinding from start to finish, and all screenwriters owe Trumbo a huge debt of gratitude for his long struggle on their behalf."

" Dissenting Voices Lost Amid the Call of a Bloodthirsty Mob
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,8,"An insider's perspective of the red scare, following the private trials and public persecutions of Oscar-winning screenwriter (and proud communist) Dalton Trumbo. It's one-sided, as you might expect, but serves as an intriguing glimpse into the might of effective media manipulation and its powerful ability to turn the tide of popular perception. Bryan Cranston plays the lead, and though he doesn't look all that much like the man behind the thick glasses and dense mustache, his intense, passionate self-defense and gravel-voiced delivery are impressive and convincing all the same. Louis CK, in an important supporting role, is less successful: he touches the necessary emotional points, but doesn't threaten to disappear into the part. He's just... Louis CK in a different set of clothes. One part historical essay and one part chilling cautionary tale, its message is particularly pertinent now, amid the nonstop spin and opinionated delivery of the modern-day news cycle. In time, Hollywood recognized its blacklist for the thin, short-sighted witch hunt it really was, but not before countless lives had been sacrificed in the name of some mythical greater good. What will we look back upon with similar regret tomorrow?"
" Trumbo a Case Within A Case
",2017-05-30 00:00:00,8,"Within its structure of being a re-visitation of events that demonstrated what can happen when democracy heads off the rails, and just how difficult it is to regain, Trumbo is quite good. Performances are uniformly professional (especially Bryan Cranston as Trumbo) as are the technical qualities in all departments. Just one problem holds it back from greatness but, it is an all important one...truth.As the filmmakers are telling a story concerning the lives of actual persons involved in the McCarthy communist witch hunt of the 50s – along with the claim they are basing it on fact – then let them be sure to do just that! We all accept that within a screenplay there will be characters and situations that are either included or excluded - for the sake of entertainment value etc BUT, never should we expect that some 'real' people will be made out to be anything other than they actually were. One seemingly unforgivable instance of this comes in the character of the great Edward G. Robinson. Here, Robinson is accused of naming some of his colleagues as being members of the communist party - an act that's not backed up by recorded transcripts of his actual court testimony. When making movies about past actual events it's not expected producers may color the truth to support what might be their own personal ideologies. This seems to be what director Jay Roach and his scriptwriter/producer John McNamara appear to have done. The transcripts of Robinson's answers do not confirm him as actually naming anyone; instead, he cleverly repeats some names that the court had already previously made known - saying words to the effect; 'well, you've already got them' and in the case of others (who also had been previously named by the court), he simply said 'he had no idea they were involved in communism'. All a far cry from the rather shaky claims of this screenplay. Apart from this (and who knows what other inaccuracies' may be contained within) Trumbo can be seen as being first class entertainment for anyone with an interest in certain historical events that shaped the USA during this period – and continue to do so. Highly recommended, but expect the now usual overuse of unnecessary course language."
" Too bedazzled to be honest and explanatory.

This whole story and characters are literally taken from the Moscow streets. Especially streets that are filled with crowds today. You can't stay quiet. You are not allowed to express yourself either. You just have to pick up which side you are on. Seriously, this Movie should be banned from modern Russia screens! Yet I've seen it there only! And that means not everything is so tragically late as it seems. Neither here nor somewhere else until characters like Hero will appear from time to time. Love this Movie!

" Powerful but serious enough?
",2017-03-31 00:00:00,8,"""Trumbo"" was rightfully nominated for some of the bigger film prizes. It tells the story of Trumbo, a writer for movie scripts, that is persuaded by the government and ends on a blacklist of Communists that aren't in the position to work as ordinary anymore.While I really enjoyed most of the movie and it kept me interested throughout the whole playtime, there are mainly two things that prevent this film from being even more powerful in my eyes. Firstly, even though the humor carries bigger parts of the movie and I like the fact that Trumbo is quick-witted, it would have been nice to see a broader variety of emotions. There must have been some situations throughout that time that really left him desperate or sad and you don't really see that in the movie.Secondly, it would have been nice to also see what this policy meant for more common people. A screenplay writer is in a quite distinguished position and I could imagine that someone working in a more ""exchangeable"" job could suffer even more from the tensions. Of course that's not the fault of the movie, since it only tells the story of Trumbo but it is a false image to think that all you have to be is a good worker to be granted justice.All in all it is a very good, but not an excellent movie. Good movie for a more serious film night."

",2017-03-04 00:00:00,9,"The story of Dalton Trumbo, an extremely gifted screenwriter whose career was almost destroyed by the Communist witch hunts and resulting Hollywood blacklist of the late-1940s/early-50s. We see how the witch hunts unfold, the results and how Trumbo manages to survive and ultimately thrive.A movie which depicts the darkest period of Hollywood's, if not America's, history. More than just showing the injustice, hysteria and lunacy involved, we see the effect this has on the people who were victims of the events. Very compelling and engaging viewing.Mixed in with the drama is some wonderfully warm, often dark, humour. Director Jay Roach definitely shows where his past experience lies...Superb performance by Bryan Cranston in the lead role, for which he received an Oscar nomination. Solid supporting cast that includes Diane Lane, Helen Mirren, John Goodman, Michael Stuhlbarg, Alan Tudyk and Louis CK."
" What is good script writing ask Dalton!!!!
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,10,"I love cinema, and time after time failed to appreciate the importance of a good script. Take the classic film Spartacus, and listen to the lines of Olivier, Laughton, Ustinov, Douglas. Yet i always leaned towards Spartacus as the finest epic ever made. Trumbo was an education, as Cranston rattled off his lines in his bath, and it hit me, we cinema goers, who are not acting students, just might underestimate the importance of script writing. As a film Trumbo does a fine job as telling us this, and it is far more important than the commie witch hunting business. Senator mccarthy died out as the cold war cooled, and common sense prevailed. I loved the film, and now i am far more critical of cinema than ever before, as i see so many movies with dreadful lines , no story and overrated CGI effects."
" A Compelling Story That Resonates Even To This Day
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,9,"I'm always up for a good historical biopic, so I was intrigued by ""Trumbo"" from the first time I heard of it. The fact that Brian Cranston was in the lead role piqued my interest even further. Amazingly, though, this movie surpassed even those high expectations by telling a highly compelling story (filled with great acting) that can still resonate just as much in today's times even though it takes place in the 1950s.For a basic plot summary, ""Trumbo"" is the story of Dalton Trumbo (Cranston), a Hollywood screenwriter who gets blacklisted and even goes to prison under the suspicion of being a Communist during the Red Scare of the 1950s. The film shows how the Communist witch-hunt played out in both Trumbo's own family, most notably wife Cleo (Diane Lane) and daughter Niki (Elle Fanning), and in his relationship with other Hollywood luminaries of the time like Edward G. Robinson (Michael Stuhlbarg), Hedda Hopper (Helen Mirren), & even John Wayne (David James Elliott).What I liked the most about ""Trumbo"" was that it really took the time to examine both sides of the Red Scare. Even though in hindsight most agree that it was ridiculous and overbearing, director Jay Roach does a great job of still humanizing both sides of the issue. There aren't black-and-white heroes or villains in this movie, but rather two sides who fervently believe they are ""right"" and keeping the country safe in doing so. Trumbo wasn't going to back down from his beliefs, and neither was a fellow like, say, Duke Wayne, which makes for an epic clash of ideologies.Of course, it sure doesn't hurt that the acting is tremendous from all involved. It quietly features an all-star cast, while Cranston continues to prove how great of an actor he is. I have trouble believing why he had to toil as ""the goofy Dad on Malcolm in the Middle"" for so long before people began realizing what a serious actor he could be.""Trumbo"" is very similar to another film that came out in 2015, that being Steven Spielberg's ""Bridge of Spies"". Both films look at the Cold War Era and draw parallels to today's turmoil-filled political landscape. ""Trumbo"", however, might be an even better experience because it is so fresh and new. With Spielberg (though obviously through no fault of his own) a viewer kind of knows what is coming, and then he always comes through. With Roach, who before this was known best for directing the three Austin Powers movies, you never know where the story is going to go. Fortunately, it always pays off and elicits high emotion.Overall, ""Trumbo"" was one of the best movies I watched of late for its ability to tell such a compelling story that really will make you think about politics today too and if anything has really changed. Do we learn from our mistakes, or will they keep popping up in other guises? That is what is at the heart of ""Trumbo"", and the incredible acting performances really drive the point home. Highly recommended for anyone who is a fan of history or even just the Hollywood scene in general."
