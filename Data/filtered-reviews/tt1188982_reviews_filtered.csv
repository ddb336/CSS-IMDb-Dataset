" A not bad film that could have been great
",2020-07-30 00:00:00,5,"Somebody has copied Pay it forward (2000) as Stalin(2006). Jai ho is is a remake of Stalin. I have not watched first two. Story had a lot of potential. But disaster struck when Salman Khan decided to make a film on it, directed by his brother and featuring Salman himself.Jai ho suffers from a syndrome called hero worship, pretty common in Bollywood. The protagonist Jai is everything, an ex army man who is master at fighting, an honest man, he can sing and dance. But he is still a bachelor, waiting for a much younger Rinki to come in his life, maybe. Salman Khan is simply terrible in his role, wheather he is happy or angry makes no difference, he carries same face throughout.There are a lot of fighting scenes, which look outdated to say true. The film is bit too over the top at times. The true story is 80-90 minutes long, rest is time waste.The cast is huge. A senior actor like Sunil Shetty is given a 2 minute role. Genelia d'souza is also there in a short role. Among major members, only tabu is good, rest are either average or poor. Sameer Khakhar, Mahesh Mahrsh Manjrekar, the kid Naman Jain are good in their little roles. No one really stands out though.I seriously don't think this is as bad as other salman khan films of that period. I am giving it a five. But there's scope for improvement in every department."
" Not worth a watch

" Tatti film at its best
",2020-03-05 00:00:00,1,"Bollywood has to stop thinking of how to make money with NO SCRIPT.
With so many though provoking films coming every year but not getting any recognition or acceptance, it is disappointing to see a NO BRAIN, NO SENSE movie like Jai Ho come out and making money for NO REASON.
Waste of time more than waste of money."
" Very good movie
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,10,"2010 marked the turning point for Salman's career, when his film Dabangg arrived. It created a nationwide sensation. First for his different character and second for Munni Badnaam. Since then, he has created a huge fan-base and each time his film becomes a Blockbuster, in spite being a dud(say Bodygaurd and Ready)."

" Let Victory Prevail!
",2017-09-12 00:00:00,8,"Jai (Salman Khan) is an ordinary man with a desire to help others. He formulates a plan in which, instead of saying ""thank you"" for a kind act, the recipient will vow to help three others, telling them to do the same. In helping others, Jai crosses the local political family, starting a feud.This is a serious and violent drama with a most positive message, encouraging the doing of good, and celebrating the power of the common man. It is an engrossing film, with an exceptionally good supporting cast. Khan wears the same serious face throughout most of the movie, and does little acting other than action, but that doesn't lesson the film. The music is good, the choreography nice, and the costumes often beautiful. Overall, this is an intense, yet feel-good film, in the best Bollywood style."
" Movie review
",2017-05-17 00:00:00,8,"Salman Khan movies always touch the hearts of audience for his acting, stardom and his looks. But for this movie i think it has another meaning for their fans. This is the reason why Salman Khan is the best among all. The script is well meaning to the society also shows the dark side of the India. In this i can say the chemistry of a Soldier in the world of evils is make a great idea for the society of helping three other by saying thanks and make a chain of union. The best part of Movie that handicapped girl who was dead due to which the hero jai got changed. At last the Movie which is meets all the parameters and hence got a good response."
