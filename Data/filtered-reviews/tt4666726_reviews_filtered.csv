" Powerful, Stunning and Captivating
",2021-03-10 00:00:00,9,"I only watched Christine yesterday and Im still deeply stunned by it. Rebecca Hall who played Christine Chubbuck definitely gave herself the best performance of her career, and Im ashamed to admit I'd never heard of her until watching this film. It was deeply upsetting and powerful on Rebecca's part to show us the final days of Christine's life leading up to her shocking suicide on national TV. There were times throughout the movie where it really made you feel for Christine's pain whether it was her battle against depression, self-deprecation or having an ovary removed because not only was it giving her a large amount of pain but the fact she will never have childrenThis movie is not all entirely doom and gloom with Christine because we do get to see sort of a brighter side to her as in she does puppet shows of disabled children. I rarely don't cry when watching movies but Im not ashamed to admit that I did cry towards the end of Christine after seeing all the pain and suffering she went though of not being able to love herself or have the life she craved. In fact I found a lot of direct parallels from this movie to Joaquin Phoenix's Joker movie. Only difference is Joker doesn't exist and doesn't commit suicide but if you watch Joker and then see Christine you can see some direct parallelsTragic story. Phenomenal acting on Rebecca's part as well as the other cast members and great soundtrack"
" A sad, sad story
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,5,"Depression rears is ugly head in the form of Christine being worried constantly. And the smallest disappointment sends her into a downward spiral. However, she is a socially awkward 30-year-old virgin with no friends living at home, who clearly suffers from mental illness. Her responses are inappropriate towards her co-workers, family, and social situations in general. She is unable to communicate, which makes being a reporter a doomed ambition. When George asks her out, he has no idea what kind of demons she is dealing with, or how unstable she really is."
" It's A Good, Honest Movie...Just Not Very Entertaining
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,6,"Being Depressed Means That Having Meaningful Relationships Will Be EXTREMELY Difficult, Nearly Impossible. A Person Suffering From Depression Has An Ever-Present Question In Their Mind: WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME ??? And That Question Is A Filter That Affects Their Interpretation Of Life Itself. A Depressed Person Simply Doesn't Know How To Relate Honestly With Others, Since They Can't Honestly Relate To Themselves.
Everything About The Movie Was Top-Notch And I Don't See Any Other Way Ms. Chubbuck's End Could Have Been Portrayed Without Diluting The True Essence Of Her Story."
" Terrific acting but seemed pointless most of the way through
",2020-10-14 00:00:00,3,"I came to this movie on Netflix not knowing anything about the real-life story it was based on. I think you had to know that beforehand; otherwise, as it was for me, it just seems to go nowhere. You see this woman in various little situations at work, socially, with her mother, and you wonder what the point is, where is it leading. After she speaks to a man selling guns, I thought she was going to shoot a bunch of people. I might have been carried along with her story if she was a sympathetic character, but she was arrogant, mean to everybody around her, self-centred, and near-crazy with professional ambition.The actor did an excellent job of portraying Christine's angst and depression, her frustration and lack of self-control, and her steady downward progression. Could she have made her more sympathetic? I don't know whether it was the actor or the script that left me aloof from Christine's plight, blaming her as much as feeling on her side, and ultimately not caring about her.I didn't like this film at all."
" Just some missing elements that would've helped
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,8,"This movie was mostly great, with Rebecca Hall being a perfect choice for this role. However, I'd like to point out a few issues.
First, the movie drags towards the end of her investigating the town and trying to get a story. I feel they spent too long on this.
Second, although you just saw the situations that were reasons for her suicide, her suicide still feels random, while in reality there were signs beforehand. More foreshadowing should've been used, as in real life she would frequently talk about her attempted suicide in 1970. She also joked to the news editor a week before that she had bought a gun and planned to kill herself on air, something that would've helped the suspenseful atmosphere of the movie if mentioned."
" A lesson in mental health and society.
",2020-08-29 00:00:00,8,"This is a tragic movie with some thought provoking examinations of Mental Health and in a broader sense, the American local news industry. The movie is mainly centered around a true story. An event that occurred in 1974. Christine was doing a news report, and infamously shot herself live on camera. The film focused mainly on the time leading to that event. Acting was fantastic from everyone and the story was very well told, keeping you engaged. Obviously, the focal point will be Christine's mental decline and not being able to cope with society around her.
However, I believe the message Christine was trying to convey is even more important. Its been over 45 years since that tragic day, and the local news is just as soul less and sensationalist as ever. We all love the simplistic individualistic reports of local murders , abuse and ignore the broader systemic problems. Crave the scandals and cater to the soap opera mentality. I find it interesting that this film was released on Oct 2016, right before the elections. The beginning of what we are living through now. Lies are ""openly"" taken as statements and reported on as ""Normal"". Illegal actions taken, barely any questions asked and no accountability. We are indeed living in the age of ""alternative facts"". We all argue with ourselves as the powers on top pull the strings.
Was it Christine that couldn't adapt to society? Or was it society couldn't adapt to Christine? Maybe its both.
Just as the movie ends with, we all get a couple of scoops of ice cream change the channel and put on light hearted music. Forget the world, forget the problems.
Not everyone is built to simply forget."
" This movie has my vote for...
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,2,"One of the slowest ... I realize it's relatively early in the 21st century and thousands of movies are yet to be made, but it wouldn't surprise me one bit if, by the year 2100, this movie will be in the top ten for the slowest movie of the last 100 years. Although Rebecca Hall is both talented and attractive, watching her for 120 minutes stand outside of life, unsure whether her reason for not being able to break through is her not wanting to or not knowing how to, was a lot to ask of a viewer. And while the climax was highly dramatic, it failed to answer the question. For this reason, I cannot recommend this movie, although I will certainly recommend Rebecca Hall."
" Great depiction of Christine's story
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,9,"I really enjoyed this movie a lot, they did her story justice"
" Life-like illustration of depression
",2020-07-23 00:00:00,9,Just wow! Rebecca Hall plays a unique role circling around a side of depression which I had not yet seen in a film before - very honest and sensitive expression of irritability and proud loneliness. It makes you reflect on occasions when you or others you've known have similarly shown resistance against support from a work and family network. A film that triggers such a strong motivation to better empathise with and support those experiencing depression I feel
" A Gripping, Empathetic Look At Depression
",2020-07-09 00:00:00,8,"The tragic live-broadcast of the suicide of Christine Chubbuck is something that's hard to fully comprehend, let alone try to make a movie about that doesn't sensationalize her end. Director Antonio Campos and writer Craig Shilowich somehow manage to navigate this complicated story with grace and tact by focusing on the person and not the incident. They let Rebecca Hall immerse herself in this role as Christine slowly reaches her ultimate choice, giving us a moving and empathetic performance that tries to make us understand her depression without turning her into a martyr.""Christine"" is hard to watch at times, but difficult to look away from.As we open to a 70s world of browns, oranges and yellows, we are introduced to television reporter Christine Chubbuck (Rebecca Hall) as she's making a film of her pretending to interview Richard Nixon. She's immediately concerned over her physical presentation and how to appear more natural. She lists her relatively mundane goals on a piece of paper, starting with the line ""be bold, be brave."" She volunteers at a children's hospital giving motivational puppet shows often mirroring the lessons she wants to believe herself. Campos wants us to know that this is a woman who is trying to be normal but doesn't know how.Christine Chubbuck is a soon-to-turn-30 TV field reporter working for a local news program in Sarasota, Florida. She mostly wants to focus on small, positive human interest stories, despite her boss Michael Nelson (Tracy Letts) insistence on increasing the coverage of crime which helps drive in the ratings. Though her job is to talk to people, her only real friend is her camerawoman/editor Jean Reed (Maria Dizzia) who tries to support her however she can. Christine has a crush on the lead anchor of the news station George Peter Ryan (Michael C. Hall, who is honestly fantastic), despite him being uninterested in her. Unfortunately, Christine gets a medical diagnosis that she must have an operation that would significantly weaken the chances of her ever becoming pregnant, a punch made more potent by the fact that Christine is a virgin as she was waiting for Mr. Right to come along to start a family. Christine lives with her mother Peg (J. Smith-Cameron) who she's at odds with after an ""episode"" in Boston caused her to relocate to a much less ideal situation she finds herself in, as Peg has no real clue how to handle her daughter.The news stations owner Bob Anderson (John Cullum) comes around and offers up a promotion to one of the Sarasota team to go work at his new, far more prestigious station in Baltimore. Christine knows that she has to ""follow orders"" in order to get ahead rather than doing what she believes in.Life, unfortunately, comes crashing down on Christine. All at once it looks like her dreams are evaporating while other people achieve what she has been unable to. She lashes out at her boss when her attempts to make more 'blood and guts' content fall flat, and her friend Jean gets her own segment that replaces the one Christine was working on. Peg tries to introduce her new boyfriend to Christine, which is met with accusations of abandonment and blame on Peg's inability to 'fix' Christine's hurt.On the night it looks like Christine might finally get what she's been wanting, the rug gets pulled out from under her by people who don't know her pain but are trying to help. The last of her dreams just fade away, despite everyone trying to reassure her that she's capable of great things. After a conversation with the station boss she gets left with the mantra of ""follow your gut."" Sadly, she does.Alas, we know how this story ends. Just watching the moment when Christine, silently, appears to decide to take her own life is almost beyond description - Hall's acting through her eyes alone is awards worthy. Campos handles ""Christine's"" concluding moments with quiet dignity. ""Christine's"" final act is mostly of hidden turmoil and sadness, and Hall captures this perfectly with the subtleties of every motion. The moment she pulls the trigger is done astoundingly well, with an emphasis on shock and bewilderment on what actually transpired.There's not enough words I can write to fully appreciate the work Rebecca Hall does as Christine Chubbuck. She just feels like a real person with real damage, and not one that is simply made up for dramatic purposes. There's a beautiful attention to detail about the way Christine simply tries to navigate this world, down to her physical mannerisms - you can see behind her eyes the thoughts coming racing through her mind before every single line she says, as if trying to calculate each move. Her moments of lashing out feel real and heartbreaking, even over small things such as the fake flowers on her interview set. She comes across as that awkward teenager in high school looking to fit in and is disappointed that she doesn't know how. The few moments where Christine isn't trying to act as normal as she can you really can feel the frustration in her not knowing what would make her happy.Campos does make a very thoughtful decision in how he films the ""character"" of Christine: we're meant to empathize with her but not necessarily like her. At one point Christine's boss calls her ""difficult"" and, well, yeah she kind of is. Christine doesn't like following orders and is brisk with everyone. She's humorless and cold, and I have no idea how she managed to keep the job she has which relies on on-air charisma. We know she's smart - even the boss who argues with her calls her the smartest person at the station - but her social deficiencies do illuminate why she lacks the friends she so desires. Campos is bold to show Christine as she was rather than romanticize her. There is this underlying feeling that we're supposed to want her to get better, but we know how this story ends.Something that is bound to frustrate some people is that Campos seems completely uninterested in making ""Christine"" about depression as a whole; it's much more about Christine as a person. At times the movie is as cold as Christine is, with odd bits of humor sprinkled throughout. It's far more subtle than most movies these days that deal with such subject matter. ""Christine"" is not a fun movie at all, and at times is hard to sit through. It's a character portrait rather than a dialogue, and personally I feel it's the only way to do justice to Christine Chubbuck without exploiting her memory.Even though I find the individual pieces of this story come together to make a fully-formed picture of Christine, they don't particularly work well together as a narrative. Campos wants to show all the parts of Christine's life that lead to her ultimate choice, but doesn't do enough to make them fit together naturally. From what I've read about the real Christine Chubbuck these multiple threads of despair took place over a much longer period than the few weeks ""Christine"" takes place in, and the need to place them all in the movie feels a tad misguided. It's the 70s during Watergate and the movie feels like it is of that era, right down to (somewhat random) part where Christine's boss lashes out at her for being a feminist. It juggles workplace sexual politics, reproductive issues, depression, familial drama, tabloid news, and other things that affected Christine, but they don't real congeal to form a strong narrative. Honestly at times the order of scenes seem random, and the script's inability to connect these disparate parts makes ""Christine"" somewhat hard to follow.It would have been far easier to make ""Christine"" be a soapbox movie about depression, but Campos' dedication to telling the harsh story of the final days of Christine Chubbuck is both cold and necessary. Campos treats history with a brutal honesty and respect, and Rebecca Hall's unsettling, masterful portrayal of a woman being torn apart by despair is almost hypnotic. While the narrative might not match Hall's performance, Christine is nonetheless a worthwhile endeavor in telling the story of a long-suffering person who loses her battle against her own thoughts."
" Sad and exciting...
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,8,"She spends most of the film expecting, after all, what the true story would be, since there is no one I know ... But I managed to feel all the pain and frustration of Christine, Rebeca's wonderful performance, intense, sometimes embarrassing, always decided and sometimes wronged. .. She screaming in silence for help, what a treacherous illness, depression associated with excessive self-charging for perfection ..."
" Great
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,8,"I remember watching a documentary on YouTube by EmpLemon (which you should all watch, btw) talking about the life and career of the NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt, leading up to his tragic death in 2001 during the Daytona 500. And one line that really stuck out to me in that video was when Emp said something along these lines:
""...however, most people will never know about Dale, as most people will just know him as some guy who died. They'll never know about the struggle, the trials, the frustation, and the victory""And this exact sentiment is why i was very interested in watching this film, and it is why i personally feel this film is great.
Rebecca Hall plays Christine Chubbuck, a shy but ambitious news reporter in the 70's that has a lot problems i her life, mostly with struggles in the news world and her struggles in the ""love"" world, which prompt her to be very reclusive and feeling very lonely and depresed.I'm putting the spoilers flair in this review so as to go in line with IMDb's rules, but to be honest, spoilers are not exactly something that the film can escape. Most, if not all who watch this movie, knows what happens at the end of it. In fact, it is probably the ""draw in"" of the film for many people. Christine is known as ""the first person to have committed suicide on live television"", aka, ""some girl who died"". So the film has a challenge: How can you make an audience care for a character that they all know will die by the end?The film has a unique look to it, not only because it taking place in the 70's, but also by it's intentional use of color and tone, to mimic how television actually looked at that time. The soundtrack, while not something super unique or special, is fairly well put together and sounds nice, although i would have liked if some scenes better without it's use. Also the use of existing music is great too, as the constant ""love songs"" add to the tragedy of Chris's lonelyness. And while the film is not really a ""technical marvel"" or anything, it does feel like a professional and well crafted movie with a story to tell. I'm also suprised at Craig Shilowich (this is his first and, as of 2020, only writing credit, as he's mostly a producer), who did a pretty good job, although some characters feel kind of silly (i'll give them the benefit of the doubt of them being characters in the 70's), and i while the ""suicide scene"" was well handled and effective, i feel like 10 minutes more of the characters dealing with this tragedy would have helped a lot with the impact of the film, although i do like the final scene with Jean. All of the acting is great but of course the real meat of the film is found on Rebecca Hall, who's the star of the film and a for good reason. She is absolutely incredible, being able to pull of both emotional fragility and the exact oposite. And yes, she totally snubbed by the Academy. Her anxiety drives the film to be a tense and sad experience, obviously building up to a disturbing climax.Antonio Campos and company have made a great drama that is respectful to Chubbuck's memory while also giving a realistic take on depression and how it slowly affects people's lives until it's too late. This is certainly an overlooked gem of 2016, and definitely a must see of that year."
" Wow. Just wow!!!
",2020-05-21 00:00:00,8,"I had never heard of this story before, so this was all new to me. But WOW...it was insane. Granted mental health was not taken seriously back in the 70s, but this woman had A LOT going on. I would venture to say she was possibly on the spectrum on top of suffering from major depression and anxiety. Smh...she was so....just....off and awkward. Wow. That's all I can say, wow. Sad how it all ended, and just really was heartbreaking for all involved in witnessing such a horrible and traumatic act. The film did drag at points, but it really brought out how off Christine was, how out of touch with others she was, how much pain she was in. Good watch!"
" Hated it
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,2,"Firstly, yes it represents depression... As a suffering bipolar I hated it... Not for any other reason then its depressing as hell... Boring... I haven't missed the point, I understand the reason for it... However if you are depressed or have a long ongoing battle as I do I strongly recommend you avoid"
" Terrible Acting
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,1,I could only make it through the first 53 minutes of the movie that absolutely nothing happen. They could put all of it in 10.
" Surprisingly great.
",2019-08-03 00:00:00,8,"I was curious about this story. I was super surprised at how well it was done. Great. The lead is great, solid writing, great score, cinematography."
" Interesting and heartfelt film
",2019-06-09 00:00:00,7,"I could only bring myself to watch the first half of this film - I know the ending and it's too disturbing. But the movie has a lot going for it. Chiefly, the writers seek to understand and empathise with Christine, the young journalist on a small town TV news program. She's very intelligent, capable, sensitive and outspoken. But she's a misfit, unable to connect to others, and worried about her love life. There doesn't seem to be an answer to this problem, so maybe that's where her despair comes from. As Christine, Rebecca Hall is excellent. She immerses herself in this world. She is far from the glamorous TV reporter and her problems are real problems, not superficial stuff. The movie has a washed out look - a yellow tinge that gives it an other-worldly vibe. It reminds us what a different world the mid-70s were, with political and social turbulence, changing gender roles, and primitive technology, compared to today. I like how everyone in the movie seems to be muddling through life. Christine's news editor seems a bit gruff but he's not evil. He's under a lot of pressure because the news program isn't doing so well. It will probably always be a mystery about why someone would act like Christine did in the end. But it's worthwhile exploring her mindset. And good on the producers for making a film about a complex, intelligent young woman who's not a Barbie doll."
" What a film! It should have been showered with awards.
",2019-04-28 00:00:00,10,"What a good film! And what an amazing actress Rebecca Hall is. It is my impression that 'Christine' didn't generate much media attention? But it should. And why on earth doesn't this have Oscar nominations? I don't get it. Perhaps because it is not a film with a happy end? Is it because Rebecca Hall makes you feel uncomfortable? You can sense the depression, sadness and confusion of Christine. How can the Academy Award take itself seriously by overseeing this masterly film?"
" Love is all around, no need to waste it ... you're going to make it after all.
",2019-04-09 00:00:00,7,"How much of this film is a construct, using an actual case, is up for grabs. Whatever the case it is, I felt, a reasonable--if harsh--portrait of how ego-centric, angry and bitter a suicide can be. Those caught up in the cycle seek sympathy for their plight, feel misunderstood, righteous, and are unwittingly supported in their delusion by family members. Whatever exceptional talent or gift that may be used as an excuse by the perpetrator as justification for their self-absorbed misery, the failure to integrate, accept and compromise what most learn is simply the experience of ""life"" itself, it's that megalomania that is the center of the problem. This film portrays it without mercy. Rebecca Hall's uncompromising performance leaves very little room for sympathy that the perpetrators of suicide crave. Her commitment to the role is what keeps us watching, even if it's a rough, unpleasant ride.The recreation of the period is so thorough that you have keep reminding yourself this film was made in 2016. I'm not sure it really adds much other than a layer of distance and alienation from the character. J. Smith-Cameron's warm, gooey portrayal as Christine's mother is so convincing it's alarming. The character's mistakes in mothering are so misguided, you want to yell, ""Run!"" to Christine. It's a performance worthy of Tennessee Williams, but Smith-Cameron never disappoints. Tracy Letts antithesis of Lou Grant is interesting but kept reminding me of the ""based on real events"" rather than involving me deeper.I'm not sure tying this so closely to a WJM small town local news struggles works. Its interesting but ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" wasn't a serious commentary on actual local television production and its strife. Did anyone ever say, ""I want to be Mary Richards and produce local news?"" What the director accomplishes stands on its own without making such a comparison and it seems an unnecessarily facile hook.And the word ""feminist"" gets misused. Whatever perceptions people had of this character and her assertion that only she ""knew what was best"" had nothing to do with feminism. It had to do with egocentricity and that isn't a gender specific trait.The triggering incident (at least as this screenplay sees it) is getting passed over for a promotion and the narcissistic rage it triggers. I think that is a trait specific (not limited to) the decade that begins the Trump era. It's an almost breathtaking prediction of the self-absorbed entitlement of a segment of the population, and whether that is exacerbated by the ""age of media"" is almost lost since the film ties this to a very specific, more innocent era of the 1970's. They could have thrown out the period reference and made a much more timely film."
" I rated it the best film of 2016
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,10,"The 70s and its war against authority, the reach for 'more'. Coming off hippies. She has a peculiar spirit, more of an artist, manifesting in the war with the station head being her father figure (he was great); the outcome is the performance art of her suicide. There was maybe nothing more 70s than that.Hall is so ghostly and immense here. You never get women in film so transformative while being completely unconnected, or anything other than society's glue. 'Yeah but'. The struggle with mental illness is maybe too easy of an out. Would it have been better she remain cool and clinical the whole way, as on her news pieces. Rather than her having wild and emotional outbreaks where they yell about how she suffers from depression?How come when we know what she's planning it, is it almost exciting, like she's about to get back at all of these horrible people by offing herself? It was like wait a minute, the film can't avoid putting that through since she's so wronged we will root for anything she decides. And then the whole thing feels confused after the event, like there it was, what was the purpose of this again? Albeit maybe the film's uncertainty what to do with it is the nature of suicide?...But it left the film's biggest misstep, is ending on the rival celebrating her career advancement. It's too easy. It simplifies a gradual meltdown into basic 'humanity is evil' conclusions. It should have focused mainly on the station head father figure, cig in mouth mumbling regrets. and then the mum in a drugged daze, who'd completely let Christine down, poisoning being a woman, imparting no purpose. Maybe show some interaction between them being crucial story symbols, that contrast of mother and (absent) father, would be a far more meaningful and damning way to encapsulate the film and the 70s as a whole, rather than the ruthless cutthroat feminism it concludes with."
" Tension builds throughout
",2019-02-26 00:00:00,8,"I did not know the true story on which this film is based, and so viewed it without expectation or anticipation. It's marvellous. Despite not knowing where it is going, I felt throughout that *something* explosive would happen.
I really enjoyed it."
" Meh....and that's a compliment.
",2019-01-28 00:00:00,3,"Watching this movie isn't easy - and it is not because of the tragic life of Christine Chubbuck. Is the acting good? Yes. Are the period treatments interesting? You bet. Is it a movie that has enough of a narrative to keep you engaged? No.Assuming this movie is directed with some accuracy, Christine Chubbuck was not an interesting figure. Despite her occasional attempts at light hearted humor, she was introverted and boring. She was an 'ok' journalist (naturally, upset at her lack of validation) and saddled with a maternal figure that clearly wasn't helping her mood. Oh yeah, she also had cancer. Consider all of that, and consider yourself warned.Christine is one of those movies where you constantly find yourself saying, ""oh ok, this is the scene where 'something' happens"". Well, nothing happens until the end. You find yourself constantly disappointed she is so blithely average. And this is the problem with a movie like this: It is intentionally lackluster because the main character is lackluster (not the actress, but the character). Even when she manages to provide 3 seconds of ""holy crap...did she just...?"", the moment is gone and replaced with same banal consistency that led up to the holy crap moment. Why? Because Christine Chubbuck wasn't interesting. She was a throw-away intellect caught inside a vicious world of journalism. Is that tragic? You bet. But does it make for a good movie? Not in this case.We are often admonished by professional reviewers because us 'average folk' don't appreciate good acting and character development. Well, we do but we also like a beginning, a middle and an end; we like interesting story lines and exciting, unexpected moments. Christine is a languid, directorial display of an uninteresting person caught in the middle. We are blessed with one, exciting moment. And frankly, it is only exciting because it signals the end of a very dry treatment.Do yourself a favor....watch something else."
" A real shame.
",2018-10-17 00:00:00,4,"A sad story that has fascinated me for the better part of two decades. Such a talented, beautiful woman and such a tragic, almost horrifying end. Her story has been sensationalized in two films THIS one, and Robert Greenes ""Kate Plays Christine."" It's a shame because I believe there was more to her story than EITHER of these two films portrayed. Ironically the sort of garbage journalism that Christine soo vehemently detested has now become her story. Christine's story deserves to be told truthfully and honestly. This film tries , and fails. ""Christine"" directed by Antonio Campos and written by Craig Shilowich is pure fiction at best. Shilowich by his own admission took creative liberties from his own battles with depression in his remaking of this very sad story. But HIS story was NOT Christine's story. Several of his details in the film were straight fiction, for instance Christine's ""relaitionship"" with George Peter Ryan (played by Michael C. Hall) wasn't true. Christine's true friend at WXLT was Andrea Kirby (played by Kim Shaw) nor was the depiction of her mother Peg (played by J. Smith-Cameron) I believe Shilowich (who never interviewed Christine's loved ones nor her last living relative her brother Greg) shows a great disregard for the story. Shilowich took way too many liberties and it's a shame.. I give it 4 stars for the talents of the ever talented Rebecca Hall and actress Maria Dizzia. But otherwise I knew this film wouldn't grip viewers in the way that the story gripped me in writing almost two decades ago. A simple documentary telling the truth would serve a better understanding to the story of Christine Chubbock. Not THIS movie."
" An emotional rollercoaster; very well worth the watch
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,10,"After recently looking more in depth regarding Christine Chubbuck's death (God rest her soul), I watched this movie on Netflix. I just finished the movie minutes ago, so everything is still fresh in my mind.Immediately, we are shown that Christine is a charming yet troubled young woman. The movie mainly revolves around her job as a news reporter, but also briefly includes the other significant parts of her life (having a medical issue and then having to face an operation that could make it difficult for her to have kids, her love of putting on puppet shows for sick children, a glimpse of her home life), which I really liked. She wasn't portrayed as ""just some girl who killed herself live on air."" We were actually taken on an emotional roller coaster with her, seeing her pain and really feeling for her. Right off the bat, you know she's a likable character. She's very relatable as well. I see similarities in her character in myself. Of course, this is based off of her real personality so I can't say something like ""the directors did a great job sculpting her personality,"" but I can say that the way they portrayed her seemed to be accurate from what I've heard about her.I admire the film's attempts to recreate (almost exactly) the events. If you look at photos/videos of Christine when she lived VS Christine's character in the movie, you will see striking similarities. Of course, this is intentional, but the ability to make it so realistic is impressive. Her body language, positions, movements, postures, facial expressions and mannerisms are mirrored nicely. It shows that a lot of effort was put into the creation of this film, and the director paid attention to even the most intricate details. We are shown her mood swings and occasional erratic behavior, and how she could be difficult to approach but also very kind and loving once you get to know her. She was quite a sweetheart and a genuine person, which is portrayed well.Anyone who watches this movie most likely is familiar with the real life Christine Chubbuck story, so we all know what's coming at the end, but she's so lovable that it's hard to watch because we know what's going to happen eventually. Throughout the movie, our hearts break for her multiple times, and we just adore her. We get the sense that we could've been really good friends with her if she was still alive- or, at least, that's the feeling I got.Even though it's just a re-enactment, I still dreaded her death. Despite knowing for sure what was ahead, my mind kept hoping for the best, hoping she'd change her mind last minute, but sadly that's not how the actual story goes.All in all, I'd give this a 10/10. Of course, I didn't know Christine, so I don't know how accurate her character really was, but I can assume from what I have heard from her brother. This is a really powerful movie, and also has a life lesson throughout: you never know what someone is going through or what's going on in their head, so just be nice. You could save a life.Not a lot of movies put me in an emotional state for a while, but I was feeling sort of bummed out after watching this, especially knowing that it's a true story. This is one of those movies where you really connect with the character and get attached; it's akin to having a favorite character in a TV series but then later they get killed off. That's pretty much what this felt like. We are only given a very short glimpse of the reactions of some of those around her, but it doesn't even scratch the surface of what they must have actually felt. Nevertheless, their sense of loss is contagious.Rest In Peace, Christine Chubbuck. God bless your heart. I hope you've found peace."
" From inner depression to an outer sadness
",2018-08-09 00:00:00,6,"By this retelling of this true story it was important there was sensitivity and dignity. Also, it was important to look at different themes - pain of humiliation, career crisis, and bipolar disorder - not just a portrayal of a march to death. Christine is a gripping drama with an impeccable central performance from Rebecca Hall who helps us understand newscaster Chubbuck's psychological collapse and the indignities weathered by a woman in a 1970s news station - she becomes the manifestation of the lack of hope."
" Christine: So what, just get some footage of some fat people burning in a car crash and I'm on a plane to Baltimore...?
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,6,"Christine is a film with a strong likable lead character, lacking vision and complementary pieces.I can't see how you wouldn't like this character, Rebecca Hall's terrific. My problem's why the film's made. She shot herself on live television, so that warrants a film being made? So her story's not worthy of being told if she didn't. She was apposed to sensationalizing things to get people interested, but that's why most people will watch this film because she shot herself on television.... That's not why I watched this film, just saying. The ending may be factual but it's only a hindrance to the film in my opinion as there's no resolution, just a feeling of sombreness. Some reviews say it's trying to be a comedy and that she's boring, I don't agree with either of those statements, I find the character lovely. However, I don't think there's enough here to be a film, though I liked what it had to offer."
" This really should have been so much better
",2018-05-24 00:00:00,4,"I suppose you could call ""Christine"" a kind of real life version of ""Network"" since it tells the story of Christine Chubbuck who shot herself live on air in 1974 but this is a much more lowkey affair, an indie production and it shows. It's as if writer Craig Shilowich felt he didn't need to add any drama to a story that was supposedly dramatic enough and director Antonio Campos films it with the same cold lack of emotion he applied to ""Afterschool"" and ""Simon Killer"" but this is a film that could do with a touch of melodrama.As the slowly disintegrating reporter Rebecca Hall does what she can with the part but it's the kind of role we have seen so often in the movies before and Hall does nothing new with it other than look perpetually glum. Perhaps the only surprise isn't that Chubbuck kills herself but that she done it on air. Didn't anyone see the signs? It's not that the film is actually boring but given the material it really should have been so much better."
" Master portrait of a darkened mind
",2018-04-27 00:00:00,10,"This movie tells the brilliant story about an ambitious woman - on the outside she is tv reporter with high demands both on herself and her workplace - on the inside however she is slowely falling apart. Rebecca Hall dilevers no more than an outstanding caracter portrait of an disillusioned woman whos talents as a both funny, ethic and caring tv reporter are overlooked by her male chauvinist boss played very convincing by Tracy Letts (Lady Bird, The big short). Credits to the director (Antonio Campos) for displaying the seventies milimeter exactly and leading the actors all around to strong performances.This movie is based on true events, and will shake you to your bones and make you wonder - what just happened here!"
" A Potently Pessimistic Period Piece
",2018-04-23 00:00:00,9,"Events leading to journalist Christine Chubbuck's 1974 on-air suicide are recounted in Christine (2016), a bleak but potent film written by Craig Shilowich and directed by Antonio Campos. Strong performances by its lead actors and its visual authenticity make Christine the best overlooked film of 2016.Christine Chubbuck (Rebecca Hall) is a sincere but troubled woman working as a reporter for a local news station in Sarasota, Florida. She lives with her mother, Peg (J. Smith-Cameron), and performs puppet shows at a children's hospital on the weekends. Her life begins to spiral out of control when, approaching 30, she discovers she has a cyst on one of her ovaries and may never have children.Her boss, Michael (Tracy Letts), is concerned about falling ratings and wants Christine to cover more sensational stories. This professional dilemma is compounded by the arrival of station owner Bob Andersen (John Cullum), who wants to move some personnel to Baltimore. Christine is passed over in favor of anchor George Peter Ryan (Michael C. Hall) and sports anchor Andrea Kirby (Kim Shaw). This is a double-blow because Christine had an unrequited crush on George.I won't reveal how the film ends, but you probably already guessed. Rebecca Hall, who also starred in Professor Marston and the Wonder Women (2017) and The Dinner (2017), is outstanding as Christine Chubbuck, and won several awards for her effort. I'm not sure this film would have been nearly as good without her performance. She disappeared into the role, bringing her character to life with all the emotion and idiosyncrasies of a real person.This film's authenticity is also incredible. If you could somehow capture the look and feel of a decade, Christine does it. 1970s period pieces usually feature larger than life characters and situations. This film does the exact opposite-it shows normal people at a normal job, who happened to be involved in an incredibly tragic incident.But Christine is not entirely accurate. The film depicts Christine living with her mother, which was true, but her older brother also lived with them. I can't recall any mention of her siblings in the film. Also, in the film, Christine procrastinates getting a cyst removed from her ovary, but in real life she had the surgery a year prior to her suicide. Neither of these alterations negatively affect the film. The filmmakers needed to show how the surgery affected her in the run-up to her suicide, which would have been difficult if it occurred months before the events depicted in the movie.Christine confronts an issue in journalism that continues to be debated to this day. In the film, Christine is constantly butting heads with her boss over the definition of news. Michael is concerned about their station's low ratings and wants her to focus on more controversial stories. Christine doesn't think reporting on stories that interest people is real journalism.The push to report on crime and disaster deeply conflicts with Christine's self-image, and she frames her suicide as a statement against sensationalism in news. ""In keeping with Channel 40's policy of bringing you the latest in 'blood and guts', and in living color, you are going to see another first-attempted suicide,"" she says before she pulls a pistol and shoots herself behind her right ear.The message couldn't be any clearer, but don't expect Christine to spoon-feed you answers. The movie is like a snapshot of one moment in time. We don't know how Christine's family and coworkers deal with the tragedy, or whether it affects that station's approach to the news. Its open-endedness enhances the film's final impact."
" Christine is a harrowing character study that struggles to maintain viewer engagement.
",2018-02-28 00:00:00,7,"This is a study of Christine Chubbuck, a news reporter who took her own life live on TV. The inevitable scene where she attempts suicide was always going to be the moment that shocks the audience, but behind that is what truly captivates us. It isn't so much about the suicide, but more about Christine herself and what lead her to do this. An extremely complicated individual. Struggling socially and in her career, the downward slope towards depression was rather haunting to watch. I felt for her. She clearly wasn't the most approachable individual and her constant self-doubt ultimately lead her to her own demise. Her home life was awkward, as she still lived with her mother, and her disillusioned love for a co-worker made matters worse. It was evident that she wanted to matter, wanted to feel loved. Depression is a serious subject, and this film portrayed it with tenderness. Rebecca Hall continues to be one of the most underrated actresses working today. This is her best performance to date. She was outstanding. Her attention to detail is extraordinary, particularly as she imitated Christine's mannerisms such as a slight lean forward as she walks. The supporting cast were lesser known and I personally admired that, the focus is on Hall and should always be. Antonio Campos' directing style was very close and personal which suited the subject of this film. We follow Christine as her world continues to close in on her, having the camera always focus in on her allows that idea of being trapped to be conveyed. Unfortunately though, the screenplay isn't always engaging. Various scenes felt unnecessary and detracted from the main subject. Also the ending was too long, should've stopped as soon as she committed suicide. Would've been far more poignant. However, Christine is an extremely haunting tale of a woman who struggled so much that she took her own life, just not always compelling. Hall's best performance though, that alone is worth the watch."
" So Sorry ****Possible Spoilers***
",2018-01-03 00:00:00,1,"Sorry, I wanted to be interested in this movie, but it was boring about a boring person. The only thing ""interesting"" about her, is that she committed suicide on national television. She was boring with terrible delivery skills (if the portrayal is accurate). She was never going to burn up the charts. They way she's played by the actress doesn't help. She's obviously trying to imitate her in some way with this odd, droning voice which sounds fake. 
The wig is also terrible. Christine may have been a loved and lovely person to the people who knew her, but frankly, filming her life and making a movie of it would be like filming mine. Who gives a happy crap? A film of me going to work and being annoyed by my idiot bosses and doing some nice stuff for kids would bore everyone on this planet (including me). Very nice, but not interesting. Neither my life to others or hers to me.The background music was annoying. I hate when movies based in the 70's constantly have the music or sitcoms from that era playing in the background, loudly, drowning out dialogue. We get it. It's the 70's. Now turn off the dial. We can see the cloths, hairstyles, awful makeup, cars, and crappy, ugly furniture. We get it already. Play some of the music from that period during the opening and closing credits. Every once in a while in the movie, play a few bars, but this movie laid it on thick, which tells me it was desperate. Maybe because in reality, she was boring, had a crappy job like the rest of us, and zero personality on TV?BTW she may have been depressed, may have had bipolar disorder, but I'm seeing Asperger's.Interesting note, she died a virgin, had a love interest who died in a car accident. He was Jewish and apparently her dad was vehemently opposed. Her brother also hated her crush at the office. The tape is in safekeeping and never will be shown as it was never recorded on VHS and the family (smart move) took legal action to keep it out of the hands of the pubic. (This according to a recent interview with her brother.*)The suicide scene was anticlimactic in a movie that was anticlimactic from the first scene. In a way, it was done well as they could have entirely exploited it by showing in it slow motion, up close, repeating it and they did none of that. I do wonder if ruined by years of watching fake deaths on TV, seeing someone shoot themselves, who actually did it in real life and it doesn't register says something really awful about a society that does love blood and guts. Don't blame the media. Blame us. We got just want we asked for. Think about it. *Tip to family, if you have a troubled family member, butting in their business about love interests doesn't help someone who already had poor social skills. We know you mean well, but you only isolate an already isolated person with difficulties relating to people further. What are they going to do when you die? Live and let live. And don't be so selfish. It's not your life. It's theirs.Sorry Christine...I'm sure you were lovely, but your life was boring."
" A Real Look Into Depression
",2017-12-17 00:00:00,10,"I have to start by saying that all the negative reviews calling the film ""boring,"" ""too slow,"" or ""uninteresting"" must have been submitted by people who have not experienced this kind of mental illness first hand. I have, and the way this story was told hit the nail on the head. This film may be uncomfortable for some to watch due to the subject matter, but the slow, grinding, gutwrenching nature of depression was beautifully captured in Christine. If you've ever been to that dark place of desparation, then you'll appreciate this film. I already knew how the story was going to end, which made it even harder to watch at times, especially since I knew it was based on the true story of Christine Chubbuck, the news anchor who shot herself in the head on live television. Watching Christine teeter back and forth between the hope of bettering her circumstances, and the painful descent back down brought me to tears at times. One scene that really caught me was at around three-quarters into the movie. In the middle of conducting an interview, she has a temporary mental breakdown. She calmly tells the interviewee that they will continue the interview at a later date, and leaves the room. She runs into the bathroom and cracks, bursting into a tormented sob session. The moment her friend runs in and asks if she's okay, Christine instantaneously straightens herself up and says she's fine. A moment like that is even more haunting knowing that eventually, Christine will later take her own life with the cameras rolling, and all aimed at her."
" Fascinating biopic about a troubled 70's media personality
",2017-12-03 00:00:00,7,"I never knew anything about the true story of Christine Chubbuck when I saw this biopic detailing the last year of her life. Needless to say, this fact gave the film an extra impact, as the ending comes as quite a jolt. Chubbuck was a television journalist who worked for a local news channel in Florida. She became nationally famous when she committed suicide live on air during a news broadcast in 1974. She was a troubled individual who was frustrated with her trivial work assignments and also had difficulties in forming relationships with men. The former issue is exacerbated by the fact that the news programme she is part of has failing ratings and so her manager aims to cover more sensationalist material with the motto 'if it bleeds, it leads'. This leaves Chubbuck's human-interest stories marginalised to the point of irrelevance. While her relationship issues stem from the fact that Christine is a genuine oddball who seems to have some social condition, which renders her both forthright and awkward in one-to-one conversations. She only really seems at home when she is on the television.I found this to be a very involving drama which brought me very much to mind of The Assassination of Richard Nixon (2004) which was another early 70's period piece that focused on another social misfit who ended up making the news for a notorious incident. Both films share a downbeat tone and both sport fantastic performances in their central roles. In Christine it is Rebecca Hall who immerses herself in the persona of Christine, it really is a very good example of proper acting with Hall tackling a complex character to perfection. Despite her spiky nature I really did care about this woman and that is a large testament to Hall's skills. The other main element in which I got a kick out of was the recreation of the early 70's in all of its beige glory. It was beautifully done and helped considerably in setting the tone of events which follow. Ultimately, I found this true story to be one well worth knowing about and the film did a good job of capturing and presenting it."
" Not a solid film but directed, acted and made very well
",2017-11-15 00:00:00,8,"Holy Sh#t. The film is impressive. Not from a storyline or budget angle but from a directing stand point. I literally went to IMDb while watching the film just to look up who directed it- because I wanted to put more of his film-catalog on my must watch list. I have a feeling this film will get him noticed. He captures the 70s era perfectly and does what few directors really know how to do, use character development within the confines of the story. Plus the camera angles, lighting and etc are completely on point. I could go on and on. What's his name directed the heck out of this movie and I can not wait to see more from him. The lead actress does an incredible job as well. You can tell she has a lot of respect for her craft. I could go on and on but I have like 20 other films I need to review."
" A disturbing-cum-sad biopic !!!
",2017-11-07 00:00:00,7,"There is a scene in 'Christine' where Christine Chubbuck's boss Michael at the news station shows her a news segment of a rival news network revolving around fat people. In response, she voiced her refusal to get involved with anything like that because to her, it's 'exploitative'. This is ironic because whenever there's a film about a tragedy that happened to real life ordinary characters in the past, there is always the risk that the film might veer into exploitative territories. Thankfully, 'Christine' stays respectful to its central character. I don't know much about the real Christine Chubbuck, so I can only comment on the Christine Chubbuck that is presented in the film. The Christine in the film feels like a real, complicated and three-dimensional character. She is clearly flawed, but the director remains sensitive in his treatment of her in the film.The period setting of 1970s America plays a thematic and contextual role in the film. This is post-Watergate America, one can sense the desperation, cynicism and the restlessness of the era. One can also feel that Christine Chubbuck is a woman of the new age who believes in the Feminist movement and the Women's Liberation movement. She is presented as a character who is on one hand plagued by acute loneliness, but one the other hand it is suggested that she is someone who deliberately blocks people out of her lives and doesn't open up to anyone. This resistance to having a meaningful connection with others or her inability to open up to anyone properly could be down to the fact that as a strong independent feminist woman working in the male dominated industry of journalism, she feels voicing her insecurities and making herself look vulnerable will make her look weak. The film does well to show how the confluence of a number of factors like loneliness, a frictional relationship with your parents, a directionless job,etc. can lead to an inescapable feeling of depression. Rebecca Hall pretty much single-handedly carries the film. It's a comprehensive performance where she uses her physicality, her eyes, her voice and everything at her disposal to create this complicated character on screen.But the film gets hampered a bit due to some of the writing. There are scenes where the dialogue becomes far too flowery which contradicts the matter-of-fact like dialogue of the other scenes. There are directorial choices here and there which also felt too heavy-handed. An example of this will be the very first scene of the film where we see a big carton with the word 'FRAGILE' written on it being inserted in the room at the background while we see Christine in the foreground.It's not a perfect film, but at least the director gets tricky job of the treatment of his central character right."
" intriguing performance
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,6,"It's 1973 Sarasota, Florida. Christine Chubbuck (Rebecca Hall) is a struggling TV news reporter doing humanist stories. Watergate is heating up and she is high-minded about reporting. George (Michael C. Hall) is the handsome anchor. Camerawoman Jean is her best friend. Station manager Michael tells them that the station is failing and pushes, ""If it bleeds, it leads."" Christine's doctor has a dire diagnosis. Station owner Bob Andersen has purchased another news station in big market Baltimore and is looking take along one reporter. Pressure mounts as she does something shocking on live TV.This movie is based on true events as it tells the audience in the opening credits. It's hampered by a story that climaxes in one big moment after two meandering hours. There are lots of interesting sign posts to detour from the path but the story never goes down those roads. There's a great creepy gun guy but he's an one-off. There's a truncated affair that never starts. We're left with an intriguing performance from Rebecca Hall of a tightly wound woman but it is mostly internal. It's two hours of frustrating powerlessness as we watch a woman drowning in her own mind. That could be compelling but somehow, this is unsatisfying."
" Rebecca Hall Owns this Role!! Fantastic Performance!
",2017-09-29 00:00:00,8,"I went into this film knowing nothing about it. After the film finished, I was speechless. I couldn't believe this was a true story and I spent the next two hours researching it on Google. Rebecca Hall gives the performance of her life as Christine Chubbuck. Rebecca Hall commits to the character of Christine every moment of the way as we feel Christine's depression, her sadness, her frustration, her soul (which is going down a downward spiral as she already has been going down that path for many years now) and we go along on the full journey with Christine throughout the film and it's only because Rebecca Hall committed so well to the character. Rebecca Hall should have been nominated for everything for her portrayal of Christine. It's really a shame that Ms. Hall didn't get nominated for a SAG Award, a Golden Globe, or an Academy Award, nothing. Once you see this film you will also wonder why she didn't get nominated. Ms. Hall is absolutely sensational as Christine. See this film for Rebecca Hall's performance, you won't be disappointed."
" A tough watch with a career best turn from Rebecca Hall
",2017-09-10 00:00:00,6,"Christine (no relation to the Stephen King Christine) is an uncomfortable watch.There's nothing grisly, seedy or terrifying but Antonio Campos's film presents such a realistic and unquestionably bleak portrait of a rapidly deteriorating human being, brought down to her lowest ebb through unrealistic expectations and dreams, that it makes for eye squinting and tough viewing, in this retelling of real life news reporter/journalist Christine Chubbuck.There may be many that know of Chubbuck's story but for the sake of those that don't, Campos's film delves into the final months of Chubbuck's life as her fractured ego and increasingly erratic behaviour towards her work, co-workers such as Maria Dizzia's good hearted colleague Jean, Tracy Lett's tough station boss Michael or Michael C. Hall's potential love interest and news anchor George and genuine everyday life threatens to implode at any moment and when that moment comes, it ends up being one of the most shocking and sad moments in television history.Chubbuck isn't at all an easy person to relate or warm to. She's quick to wrath, stubborn beyond reasoning, cold and self-centred but she's also clearly a person that wasn't in a sane state of mind and nailing this tricky business is Rebecca Hall who delivers a career best turn as the doomed figure.A for some reason long-standing member of Hollywood's underrated field, Hall has over a number of years performed strongly in a large collection of big budgeted and smaller scale pictures but Chubbuck gives her a chance to really show her acting chops.In almost every frame of the film, Hall is never less than captivating, even though Chubbuck is herself equally frustrating and it's likely had this film gained more traction in the mainstream media, Hall would've been a worthy player in awards season attention.From big moments through to small subtle character traits Hall embodies this lost soul and is the best thing about the sometimes monotonously paced film and she's that good that many of the films side characters including those played by Michael C. Hall and Dizzia feel a little underwhelming, with Michael C. Hall in particular once again finding himself in a role that is below his range and it feels as though the highs of early Dexter are still a ways off from being recaptured in feature length roles.Final Say – Capturing the time and place of early 1970's America well, Christine is a solid if unremarkable drama that's filled to overflowing with foreboding, bleakness and disappointment, making it not for everyone but harbouring a noteworthy performance from Rebecca Hall. Christine is a tough slog but one that's worth tuning in for.3 hand puppet shows out of 5"
" Wow
",2017-07-13 00:00:00,6,"Can a movie be more boring, that drags you on for 2 hours with nothing happening....And then bam! A good ending happened. I was confused trying to rate this because I liked the end and know that this was a true story but it was told in such a long drawn out boring tone that it really was a waste of time. If you want to watch a movie about a boring women that does nothing with her life then watch this. If I had to watch this all over again, I would pass. My 6 rating encompassed the acting which I thought was good, the end which was good, the realism since it was a true story and that is it. Watch the first 15 minutes, leave the room for the next hour and then come back. This would make for a terrific short story of like 30 minutes. That's it. Nothing less, nothing more."
" As close as it's going to get.
",2017-07-08 00:00:00,10,"I won't lie. I had been intrigued by the notion of someone like Christine Chubbuck doing what she did on live TV, and I did as much research into it as I could, mostly through YouTube.It should be known to those that don't already know that the video footage of this DOES NOT EXIST ON THE INTERNET! Not on YouTube! Not on any other video web site! Not ANYWHERE! This happened three years before home VCRs hit the market, and the one videotape of the incident will probably never be released.This movie takes place in the weeks leading up to Christine's suicide and it does give us a glimpse of her life at that point. Someone whose own personal demons and the state of the industry she works in and wants to thrive in collude to finally lead her to her last and most infamous decision.This is as close as it will probably ever get to seeing what she did live ever, for better or worse, so if you're one of those who want closure in that sense, then it's right here."
" Enter a world of ordinary mediocrity and disappointment--hard to pull off
",2017-06-26 00:00:00,7,"Christine (2016)A small market local television station in Western Florida in the 1970s might be the epitome of tawdry, pathetic America. Or so it appears here, where a rag-tag crew of struggling journalists and talking heads patch together a low budget news show every day. And ratings are going down.Christine (played by Rebecca Hall) is a second string reporter in this wishful situation. Her life is full of compromises, and her efforts to excel at her work are awkward and sometimes sad. But she has determination, and works hard. When two of her colleagues are chosen over her for promotion, it's just another reminder that life sucks.First point to make here: don't read anything about the big point of this movie ahead of time. I was lucky to not have a clue what this was all leading up to, and it was a final terrific punch to a slow, empathetic lead up. By empathetic I mean that the movie makers (writer Craig Shilowich and director Antonia Campos) have shown the situation for what it was. It took a lot of restraint to keep this from turning to parody, or to become critical, or even to be highly dramatic in a kind of glitzy way. There is a steady, almost disappointing feeling to it all. Not a single character seems admirable, and yet every one is perfectly ordinary and nice. Even the incompetence throughout is a normal kind of mediocrity, mixed with sprinkles of hope and humor. And people are generally good to each other even as they strive to move up (and out of Sarasota). It's a realistic construction of a mise-en-scene that will not sparkle or create intrigue or move you in particular. Until the end.And that's pretty amazing. The dullness and the acting might strike you as just bad— as if this movie just plain sucks. But it's not the movie, but the subject, that is so uninspiring. Stick it out, if you like it at all. Admire Hall's acting, which is remarkably nuanced."
" Hall hits it out of the park.
",2017-06-01 00:00:00,8,"Rebecca Hall is mesmerizing in her portrayal of Sarasota, Florida TV news personality, Christine Chubbuck, who shot and killed herself on air in 1974. Since the release of this film, there have been think pieces written using Chubbuck's suicide as a touchstone for musings on the nature of journalism, then and now, and its impact on her actions. But what we see in this film, and which likely cuts closer to the truth, is that Chubbuck was a young woman with crippling emotional problems who was finally overwhelmed by them. Unmarried and a virgin at 29 going on 30, yet desperately wanting a husband and children; needing a cystic ovary removed reducing her chances of ever getting pregnant; feeling thwarted in her ambition to move forward in her on-air career (for which she seemed hopelessly unsuited in an era when happy talk newscasts with young, perky blonde newsreaders was becoming THE format du jour); still living with her mother (in what looked like her childhood bedroom), an aging woman trying to live the hippie lifestyle; having a hopeless crush on a co-worker already involved with another - one doesn't need to look any further to understand the sense of utter hopelessness that drove her to put a gun to her head. The strength of the film is in Hall's characterization. We see Chubbuck's extreme awkwardness and abrasiveness in almost all her social interactions; her desperate need for close relationships yet pushing people away when they reach out to her. Her pain is almost palpable. Chubbuck believed at 29 she was a failure at life. There doesn't seem to be anything more to her suicide than that. The film perfectly captures the zeitgeist of the times. In fact, it looks and feels as though it was shot in 1974, rather than 2016 (the array of polyester clothing is amazing, and the soundtrack is 1974 top 40 hits and Watergate). Warning: this is not an uplifting film. It's the sad story of a sad woman that has transmuted into Internet urban legend because of the myths surrounding what happened to the videotape of her death."
" Tried to take on a difficult subject but wasn't up to it.
",2017-05-13 00:00:00,2,"Christine's story is a depressing one, and 99% of the audience knows what's going to happen at the end. So the director has to be exceptional to hold our interest and keep the drama, but he fails at both. The character Christine is pretty depressed and a little weird/unstable from the very beginning. There's no watching her fall into depression; she's already there. That detracts A LOT from any character development we may want to see. Instead, we see someone depressed during the beginning, middle, and end. No changes. Boring. He director tells her to go cover a big dangerous fire, but she disobeys and instead chooses to cover a minor boundary dispute between two counties. She also talks to herself and pretends to interview people. Yes, she is THAT boring, and this movie follows suit."
" I Scream and a Song.

However, this film illustrated the whole issue in a not so capturing way.If I had known who Christine Chubbuck was before watching this movie, given how this story was told, I would've spent the whole movie just waiting to finally see the act that ended it all, and paid not as much attention to her life story to properly connect.But, I didn't know who Christine Chubbuck was before watching this film, and still, that impacted negatively. I spent a good 90% - 95% of Christine, trying to figure out what the movie was about. In the beginning, is it about a Nixon interview? Is it about Christine's career? Further into the movie; Is it about her connection to the TV station? Is it about her family life? A little deeper into the movie; Is it about the stomach pains? Is she bi-polar? Is she depressed? Is it about having a baby and it dies? What is this movie about?Also, what happened in Boston? Christine was a cluster of questions, one after the next, then with 10 minutes left of the movie, the viewer is given a tragic consequence to what perhaps, are still unanswered questions.This film is of depression, and understandably, especially given that it is a bio drama, depicting the theme is by connecting us to the patient and their life and reason as to why this disease has a hold on them. Sadly, the bio and depression combo can make for a not so captivating depiction, however, it doesn't make the story any less tragic, sad and heartbreaking.Rebecca Hall, what can I say, I love her more and more with every performance, and Michael C. Hall, it was good seeing him do such a good job outside of Dexter.Like I said, I would love to give Christine more than just 6/10, just for its sheer subject matter depth, but, the movie itself lacked some sort of intensity and connectivity that if it had, this film would've been a misty-eyed lump in your throat artistic tribulation."
" Death of a Career Woman
",2017-05-12 00:00:00,8,"The real Christine Chubbuck (played by Rebecca Hall) committed suicide in 1974 during a live morning news show broadcast from a local TV station in Sarasota, Florida. While her struggle with mental depression no doubt triggered this decision, the underlying theme of this movie carries a powerful message about choices facing career women in modern day America. Christine is happiest when she sings along to her car radio, shows off her sly sense of humour as host of the human interest news segments, and puts on puppet shows for children hospitalized with intellectual disabilities. But she is also driven with ambition and fights tooth and nail with the TV station manager (Tracy Letts) who wants to change the news format and refuses to help advance her career. She uses work as an excuse to avoid intimate friendships with the news anchor, George (Michael C. Hall), her young director and admirer, Jean (Maria Dizzia), and her likable co-worker, Steve (Timothy Simons). Her mother, Peg (J. Smith-Cameron) also a working woman who has found comfort in casual sex and marijuana, blames mental depression for robbing her daughter of the physical embraces she desperately needs but Christine is a career women struggling to find her own sexual norms and in the end chooses to kill herself rather than abandon this dream. Ironically, the movie ends with the theme song from the ""Mary Tyler Moore"" show playing in the background. If you like offbeat characters, you will enjoy the movie ""Christine""."
" A For Effort
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,8,"Based on the true story of Chris Chubbuck, Christine hits almost every mark needed to portray a compelling film without being encumbered by the exploitative habits stories of this nature often lend themselves to. Nuance is the key to this film. It's brilliance lies squarely within its subtitles. The film maker charged his lead actress with an almost impossible task and, from all accounts, she nailed it. The real Christine is shrouded in mystery. Not much is known about her besides her very public departure. I believe there is approximately 20 minutes of video footage available of her work on Suncoast Digest and no other sources of information about anything happening before July 15, 1974. With such limited inspiration, Rebecca Hall delivers! People who knew the real woman say she has captured her charge perfectly. The entire cast was great but Hall outshines everyone with her awkward, honest, and desperate performance. Does the movie drag a bit? Yes. Are there scenes so awkward that the audience feels a bit uncomfortable? Absolutely. Do certain situations feel forced or over analyzed on the part of the protagonist? How can it be another way? These factors create the feel of the film. It helps the viewer feel what it is assumed that Chubbuck felt, her ""different drumbeat"" as her mother put it. The hardest scenes to watch were the puppet show scenes. No doubt all imagined by the writer, though we do know that the real Chris did perform for disabled children, the stories she created for them are her outlet for the trepidation she felt when dealing with the world. Be brave, be bold. Tell people who you are. Painful lessons to those who know what's coming. The low point of the film are with the fictionalized Daiss Auto/Gun Shop. Honestly, that whole storyline feel as contrived as it is fictionalized. Everyone assumed Chris bought her .38 SW revolver at the Bullet Hole, a gun ship in Sarasota. I'm not sure why the writers took this direction but it is distracting. Also, the choice to leave out the real life story of Chris doing an episode of Suncoast Digest about suicide, even interviewing a cop who she asked what is the most effective method to kill oneself (which, 3 weeks later she followed to a T) takes away from the ""bio pic"" feel, especially since most of the viewers know her story by heart. Even with the creative gun storyline, her pain and disillusionment is palpable. My main criticism,and reason for the 8/10 reason, is the minimal attention given to her mental health. There is brief mention of a previous breakdown, and that she had taken antidepressants, that's really it. From family accounts, Chris had struggled with mental health issues since high school. Overall, a great movie about a very difficult topic. I was skeptical going in but am glad I made the decision to watch it. Anachronisms: Peg's TV wasn't made in 1974, the doctor says that Chris' chart said that she had been taking Trazodone, I'm fairly certain that it wasn't approved by the FDA to treat depression in the US until 1981.rest in peace Chris Chubbuck"
" Very depressive movie, hard to watch, makes you feel drowning.
",2017-05-08 00:00:00,1,"Christine. Young woman working as a news reporter craving for promotion. Underestimated, stressed, hardly socializing, drowning in swampiest places of her life as the movie progresses. Heavy and hard movie that is made pretty well over all in the style of early 80's with its heavy and dense mood that is going from bad to worse."
" If it bleeds, it leads.
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,7,"Life is precious. Bad times always get good again eventually. Winter turns to spring and you feel the warmth of the sun on your face again. So what drives someone – anyone – to the point of despair sufficient for them to ignore all of the potential upturns and to take their own life?Christine tells the tragic tale of Florida TV news reporter Christine Chubbuck who committed suicide live on air in 1974. Yes, this is a spoiler, but since most people have some sense of what a film is about before they go to see it, it's not really a big one. And I think in this case, knowing the outcome is pretty essential since otherwise you will likely spend 2 hours getting increasingly irritated by the erratic behaviour of the lead character and may possibly turn it off. With this movie, the telling is in the journey – not the destination.London-born Rebecca Hall (""The Town"") plays the 30 year old virgin Christine; a damaged article with past mental issues, she has been moved by her mother Peg (J Smith-Cameron) from Boston to Florida to make a fresh start. But the station is struggling and Christine's insistence on pursuing dull but worthy stories, such as zoning disputes, isn't helping: she is driving her boss (Tracy Letts) to distraction. Despite her spiky demeanour and unapproachable nature, her colleagues including Jean (Maria Dizzia), the show's anchor (and potential deflowerer) George (Michael C Hall) and weatherman Steve (Timothy Simons from ""Veep"") all do their best to support her. It is part of the true tragedy of the piece that her downward spiral continues despite their best efforts.Hall is outstanding in the role. She portrays the crazily compulsive behaviour of Chubbuck extremely well: perfectionism gone wild as she attempts to edit out 3 seconds off a clip while the film is already in the machine. At times the other-worldliness and creepiness of her character become extremely unsettling; an excruciating scene with a married couple in a bar being a case in point. Overall it's an extremely thoughtful portrayal that is as quiet and unassuming as Ruth Negga's in ""Loving"" (but without the smiles or the charm). I would like to think that after the Oscars team picked the 'obvious contenders' of Portman, Stone and Huppert, and with a place 'reserved' for Streep, they were left with Negga and Hall and had a ""dammit, we can only pick 1 out of 2 here"" moment.Letts as the crotchety station chief also delivers a fine performance, and it's a shame that the script never gave us the chance to see his post-shooting reactions, since the 'if only' ramifications for him in particular must have been huge.In retrospect, Chubbuck's actions were bizarre: taking her life in such a public way (and insisting the show be recorded for her ""reels"") strikes of narcissism and a bitter revenge. While the film is no doubt based on the true recollections of the real-life participants, the screenplay by Craig Shilowich, in an impressive writing debut, for me never quite closed that loop: why this way rather that a car and a hosepipe?Directed by Antonio Campos, this is never an easy watch. It's a bit like watching a car crash in ultra-slow motion, and pretty much mandates that you watch an episode of ""Father Ted"" afterwards to cheer yourself up! But it's a fascinating study in mental decline, and it's a useful reminder that it behoves all of us to pay more attention to others around us and reach out with real help if needed before the worst can happen.(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review.

" Too long for that kind of story
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,5,As an European I never heard about Christine Chubbuck so I didn't know what to expect. My wife is American so she knew about her and it was my wife that told me it could be a good movie since I like stories based on true events. But I'm not impressed by this movie at all. It's way too long for what it is. I didn't know what was going to happen since I never heard of that story but I managed to figure it out about twenty minutes before it happened. The character of Christine Chubbuck played by Rebecca Hall is extremely annoying. If that woman was really like that in true life I probably could not have stand her. She's an attention seeking depressed lunatic in my eyes and I'm not surprised at all of what she did. But the movie itself isn't as good as the ratings it gets. Well that's my opinion. I'd rather have googled her name and read about it then spending two hours of watching it.
" Powerfully Moving Film
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,9,"Rebecca Hall was a total revelation to me. I recognized her, but I couldn't remember where I saw her. She was absolutely amazing. This is a sad story, but it's so beautifully told. The script, acting, and directing are all top notch.I wanted so badly to help this troubled person.This film touched me deeply."
" Music from the movie
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed the 70's soundtrack but found some things disturbing. Some of the songs were beautifully interwoven like ""Annie's Song,"" ""Please Come to Boston"" and ""Rock Your Baby"" while other 60's songs were distracting to the feel and style of the movie. The biggest mistake was the song ""I'm Leaving It All Up to You"" which was a big hit in 1974, the year the movie is set, by Donny and Marie Osmond but instead of using that track the director dug up an old album version by Sonny and Cher from 1966. It was very distracting and the kind of goof that is not necessary if they would have done the smallest research. Otherwise, the cars, computers and clothes were very 70's and helped to set the scene. The Mary Tyler Moore theme was a great addition and I did not find it distracting that they used the lyrics that were changed a few years later. The background news coverage of the Watergate hearings was eerie and set the tone. A very stylish, dark and meaningful piece of art. As a child of that era, I found the film educational and entertaining. Must see."
" Waste of time
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,2,"Although a true story and possibly written to the exacting personality of Christine I thought it was terribly made. Of course we know the ending going in but still it could have been better written, better acted and better filmed/directed. I was bored within the first 20 minutes and shouldn't have been, not with a story this well known or violently ended. Don't waste your time and not all well known actors are given great scripts or make great choices."
" CHRISTINE's true grit lies in its cogent message because forty-odd years after, Christine Chubbuck's story is alas, still very much relevant, obviously
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,8,"American director Antonio Campos' third feature, CHRISTINE is an surgical recount of the true story about Christine Chubbuck (Rebeca Hall), a field news reporter of Sarasota, Florida in the 70s, beleaguered by mental stress and career setback, she shocked the world with an extreme act during one of her live report, sending off her wrath and despair to the ever rating-thirsty, sensation-seeking TV media, what she left behind is a whiff of pungent irony and a pang of grief.It is Rebecca Hall's personal showpiece first and foremost, this underrated and often underutilized UK actress is among the best of her peers but fame and recognition have still eluded her. Here, she takes it on herself in submerging into the character of Christine, from appearance, utterance to accent, she completely knocks audience dead, especially for those who are familiar with her other works, her transmogrification immediately leavens the less intriguing personal travails as we are witnessing how life pushes her into the cul-de-sac. Christine is an ambitious, prepossessing 29-year-old single woman, and admitted by her boss Michael (Letts) that she is the smartest amongst all the staff, yet, when a promotion chance crops up, guess who are in the receiving end? Not Christine, because Michael and her are on bad terms, why is that? There is a rift in their work ethic, (as usual) he wants to raise the ratings by juicy stories, but she prefers those of a more life-affirming and human nature. But, that is not the decisive reason, as the plot thickens, Christine caves in and willing to track down some eye- catching incidents through a method à la Dan Gilroy's NIGHTCRAWLER (2014), still, why a seemingly competent candidate cannot get what she rightfully deserves? Sexism, that is the bane underlying Christine's tragedy, and Campos strenuously brings that home to viewers, a prevalent pathology derives from men towards women, not any woman, but those who can match (or surpass) them on an intelligent level, desirable but independent, refuse to be a soft touch. Michael is the typical sexist boss, opinionated, contemptible but his leverage on Christine is not as important as George (Michael C. Hall), Christine's colleague, the news anchorman whom she has cottoned to but dares not to act it out, a well-maintained plot-line wavering between an ostensible mutual attraction and a platonic work-mate affinity plays up in the critical moment, when George finally asks her out for a date and gloats over the promotion in front of her face at the end of it, is he that insensitive? Maybe, but is George culpable for Christine's kamikaze action? Prima facie, he might be not, it is another ""he is just not that into her"" scenario, at any rate, he cares for her, introduces the group therapy to her simply for her benefit, he hopes she well, that is the bottom line (driven by guilt probably), yet what he doesn't reveal to Christine becomes the final nail in her coffin, however unwittingly he is, because deep down, he is as much a sexist as Michael and he might even not realize that, that's the nitty-gritty of the whole story. As corny and excruciatingly honest-to-goodness as that, a man sabotages a woman's chance just because she can be a threat to him intelligently, there is something deeply hypocritical in George's action and Michael C. Hall nails the subtlety to the core.On the petticoat front, apart from Christine unwavering under the spotlight, and her clueless hippie mother Peg (a solid Smith-Cameron, or Ms. Kenneth Lonergan), interestingly, the film's coda centers on Jean (Dizzia, an un-showy but unexpectedly tender performer), the modest and rational camera operator and Christine's best friend, who is a few years older than her, but similarly, leads a solitary life and all she can do in the aftermath is eating a few scoop of ice-cream and singing along the theme-song of The Mary Tyler Moore show on radio, just like what she does on a bad day (a friendly suggestion Christine should have taken), no wonder she is not on that promotion list as well, only if there is enough ice-cream in the world for all the women who take the short end of the stick in their professional sphere just because their gender.Relishing in its 70's retro atmosphere and minutiae, CHRISTINE doesn't sensationalize its headline- worthy source and rounds out an enthralling character study of a hapless troubled soul (although, more meat could be added to the calm-before-the-storm segment), whose vitality is gradually consumed by an unhealthy microcosm she is entrapped, but its true grit lies in its cogent message because forty-odd years after, Christine Chubbuck's story is alas, still very much relevant, obviously."
" A sad portrait of depression that led to a real on-air suicide.
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,7,"Depression and suicide do not make pretty subjects for a film. It is easy to produce a voyeuristic essay that exploits someone's despair and self-destruction, but portraying tragedy without sensationalising or trivialising it is as tough as it gets for directors and actors. While most suicides are silent and private, TV journalist Christine Chubbuck chose the most public stage available when in July 1974 she shot herself in the head, live and on-camera. Christine (2016) is her story.At 29 years of age, anxiety-ridden over a career that stalled, still a virgin and living with her mum, Christine (Rebecca Hall) faces a daily struggle with herself and everyone around her. She is a serious journalist who believes her main role is to tell the truth about important issues but she is also a very difficult person to be near. Hyper self-critical, she needs constant stroking and clashes frequently with her TV station boss who is under pressure to improve ratings. He wants sensationalist coverage of human interest stories, so she is sidelined while others get the breaks. She has long had a crush on another announcer, but he is wary of getting involved with someone so intense. When she finds out he is dating someone it adds another layer of despair; her divorcée mother brings home a date and it feels as if life could not rub enough salt into her wounds.The tension across this story rises incrementally, with each episode triggering another outburst but not serious enough to push her over the edge. While the episodes subside they do not disperse, and their cumulative effect is to store increasingly volatile fuel that slowly approaches flashpoint. The storytelling imparts a sense of us intimately knowing Christine, seeing what she is going through, feeling her waves of emotion and knowing that she cannot take much more of this. Whether its empathy, curiosity or voyeurism, there is no mistaking our proximity to her when, in the film's closing moments, she looks straight down the camera lens and says ""bringing you the latest in blood and guts, and living colour, you are going to see another first"", and then shoots herself.This film is not for viewers who are looking for action-based drama. It offers little of that, but loads of characterisation. Rebecca Hall is brilliant as Christine, tip-toeing the fine line between appearance of normality and deep despair. It is extraordinary that in her final minutes we can almost feel what it is like to have no hope and see no other way out. This is one of the most high- voltage female lead performances of the year, and begs the question why Christine (2016) was so overlooked at the Academy Awards.Everything in this film leads inexorably towards what we know is going to happen. One effect of this is that we readily interpret all that we see as causally linked symptoms of acute depression. It would be easy to say that now, more than four decades later, this could not happen again because we know so much more about the causes and treatment of this debilitating condition. But of course, this is not true; and that is why this is such an important film."
" Well made movie about how tragedy is brought about when life and career problems intersect.
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,8,"""Christine"" is one of those movies that you watch as it feels real(as it's based on real life events)and you feel sorrow and pain of the main central character named Christine Chubbuck(well acted by Rebecca Hall)as you can see one by one her whole life with people and her job life is spinning out of control. Set in mid 1970's Florida in Sarasota, Christine Chubbuck is a small town news reporter and anchor who wants like everyone else to strike it big getting a break to a big market, yet her passion is wanting to report on stories of social justice like women issues, and health matters, yet the station's boss named Michael(Tracy Letts)butts heads with her as he wants stories that are breaking with juicier details that involve crime, murder, and scandal as those are what he feels are ratings winners.Also Christine's home life is a mess as she doesn't get along with her mother who's became a pot smoker and this young woman doesn't score as she claims to be a virgin and a little bit of hope is found when she makes friends with on air co-worker George(Michael C. Hall). Yet love and job success is tough to find and the dark reality of loss and grief starts to set in on her all leading to a shock on air a turn that's a tragedy. Overall well done film that's a showcase of how one's life can slip away when life, love, and job problems combine together as they become to much for one lady who was destined for bigger things."
" ""Christine"": Rebecca Hall Riveting in Unnerving Chronicle of the Ravages of Mental Illness.
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,8,"I once worked in local television news and sports broadcasting.  After a few years I came to recognize that I did not have near the, to quote the great George Carlin, ""Dig Me"" show biz mentality to stay with it for long.  Most of the other folks who toiled along side me during that time certainly did.  However, none of them to near the desperate extent of the tormented soul revealed in ""Christine"".  At least not to my knowledge, that is.  After all, who among us can know what goes on when one is alone?  In ""Christine"" we see this troubled woman, the late TV reporter Christine Chubbuck, alone in her tortured world a lot.  And it is far from a pleasant place either to be or to behold.Rebecca Hall (""The Gift"", ""Iron Man 3"") is searing as Chubbuck, whose fate I won't reveal if you are not already familiar with the shocking circumstances of her story from the 1970's.  Hall's piercingly unsettling portrayal of a young woman in the throes of mental illness is bound to linger with you awhile.  It certainly has with me.  Chubbuck is relentlessly single-minded in her tenacious drive to move on and up to a top rated market.  She is talented and quite often personable.  She actually hatches the strikingly progressive idea of a kind of ""reality television"", although she is incapable of effectively articulating such.  Chubbuck suggests to her irascible News Director (Tracy Letts of Amazon Video's ""Divorce"")  that she chronicle the lives of ordinary people and present these stories to the struggling station's limited viewing audience in an effort to boost paltry ratings.  But this notion, along with practically everything else she proposes, is derailed before it can get on track as a result of Chubbuck's almost complete (and painfully oblivious) lack of social skills or an internal filter, thus stifling any real hope of advancing her career.   Hall's performance is at once touching, harrowing and heartbreaking.  In a hauntingly memorable manifestation of the mousy, vacant-eyed Chubbuck, the gifted actress gives us a woman who is fully aware that she has an insidious sickness (""one of her moods"" as her roommate mother chooses to classify it), yet she does little to address it, choosing to ignore her troubling symptoms, behaving as if they will simply go away and never return.  At one point we see her refusing a doctor's suggestion of a mood stabilizing med of the moment, claiming that she doesn't like the way these psyche drugs make her feel.  And with each of these self-destructive choices, Chubbuck doesn't give herself even the most remote chance of standing strong against her merciless disease.Director Antonio Campos and Cinematographer Joe Anderson mesh their respective crafts together magnificently in creating an authentic mid-'70's sensation with ""Christine"".  I came of age in this decade of the ""Smiley Face"" and Polyester, and you may need to have at least a somewhat clear recollection of the period to fully appreciate what I'm referring to with this observation.  Still, if you're not hip to what was happenin' back when we all earnestly encouraged each other to ""Have a nice day"", be mindful of this film's tone, as reflected in both the sensibility of the culture and by way of the muted and yellow hues reminiscent of the faded pages of a well-worn book.  Do this, and you will be transported right smack dab into the middle of the pervasive vibe and attitude that was uniquely indicative of this bygone, bawdy and boisterous era.There is a prominent and enduring message I came away with after having watched ""Christine"".  The American healthcare community has introduced remarkable advancements in the detection and treatment of human mental and emotional deterioration over the past forty years since this film was set.  Recognition by someone, ANYONE, who knows an individual suffering with these too often times potentially tragic issues MUST be proactive in helping them access professional help in battling a burden for which they are not responsible and over which they have no control without dedicated support.  SOMEBODY has got to genuinely CARE.Had that somebody been there with persistence for Christine Chubbuck, chances are more than reasonable that she would not have become merely a macabre footnote in our history as a country."
" Unfortunately boring
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,4,"Well made and well acted, but, unfortunately, terribly boring. I think it was 30-40 minutes too long. Somebody described it as a harrowing portrait, and I'd agree with that, it's good. It's just so long. I would cut the first 30-40 minutes where you think she's actually OK, and move from straight from the point that her job / hopes and dreams are in jeopardy."
" Downbeat tale of TV news reporter finds itself in inevitable cul-de-sac
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,4,"Christine is the true story of Christine Chubbuck, a 29 year old television reporter working for a local TV station in Sarasota, Florida. After watching the film, I wondered why I had never heard of this story before because I'm usually up on news stories that make the national news. The story however occurred in the summer of 1974, right before I was entering my senior year of college and I believe I was working as a camp counselor and didn't have access to any news during that time. Before I go any further, I would like to insert a SUPER SPOILERS warning here. If you haven't heard of this story before and prefer to watch the film without knowing the big plot twist, then stop reading HERE, go see the film and continue reading later on.Before the shocking event at the end of the film, I kept wondering what was the point in chronicling the life of this news reporter. As the narrative unfolds, the story appears to be a real downbeat tale of a woman suffering from severe depression—a sad sack if you will who is hard to care for at all. As I say in all my reviews of films involving characters with weak egos-—these are the ""sad sacks"" who simply do not make for good drama. In the case of Christine, her internal character arc is headed in the wrong direction from the beginning. Physically she is facing the removal of an ovary which may seriously impact her ability to have children. Worse is the pressure she receives from her boss Michael at the station—he insists that her human interest pieces do not garner good ratings and she should focus more on salacious crime stories. After she comes up with an idea for a documentary, Michael shoots it down and chooses another piece by Jean, her friend and camera operator at the station. This causes her to have a meltdown in front of all her co-workers, screaming at the boss, attempting to humiliate him by claiming his wife is an alcoholic.Christine develops an interest in her co-worker George, an anchor at the station. When he brings her to a self-help group, she confesses that she's a virgin but would like to get married and have children. Perhaps the straw that breaks the camel's back is when George reveals that he's been chosen to be transferred to a more desirable market in Baltimore. This propels Christine to drive over to the home of Bob Anderson, the station owner, in the mistaken belief that he's also chosen her to move to Baltimore. However, he reveals that he's chosen Andrea, the sports anchor, to go with George. It's obvious that Christine regards this as a betrayal, due to the exaggerated image she has of herself.After Christine convinces Michael to let her do a live report on the air, footage of a crime scene stalls and the shocking incident which I alluded to earlier, occurs. Christine announces that the station will air a live suicide attempt and then promptly shoots herself in the head with a gun resulting in her death.So what exactly is the point in writing this screenplay in the first place? If someone decides to commit suicide as a heroic act (during wartime, for example), maybe there's a story in that. But here? I just don't see what's so compelling about this particular person's story. A character such as this really has nowhere to go.Now think of successful films—it's always about a person who has a belief in themselves. That person can be a good person or someone thoroughly evil—but it's always the ego-driven individual who makes for compelling drama. Just imagine George Bailey in ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" killing himself after Uncle Billy absentmindedly loses the bank's money. Do you really believe that such a film would be a TV staple broadcast every Christmas? I hardly think so.Rebecca Hall stars as the hapless Christine. She does a fine job as do all the other actors in this true-life drama. If ""Christine"" has a saving grace, it's the recreation of the early 70s, an era that most of us baby boomers recall fondly, especially due to the heady days of Watergate, which figures prominently in the early segments of this film. Unfortunately all the nostalgic detail and good acting are wasted, as this meditation on suicide finds itself in an inevitable cul-de-sac."
" A heartbreaking tale of a lonely frustrated woman
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,7,This film is depressing. Christine is about a woman around the age of 29 who is lonely and desperate to be taken seriously as a news woman but hardly anything goes right for her. I was uncomfortable watching this because I saw myself in her and I knew the true story about this situation. I don't think it really matters if you know the true story or not cause it's still a good film that you won't take your eyes away from.Rebecca Hall gives a Oscar nominated performance even though she didn't get nominated. The negatives of this film is the story felt like they were trying too hard to make it more entertaining then it had to be. I'm not sure but I felt a lot of stories were made up just for the movie.I recommend this film for people who don't mind depressing films like myself. I do think this movie shouldn't have been made but I can't say why without spoiling so watch and find out for yourself unless you're not into depressing films.
" Great acting, horrible voice and accent from Rebecca Hall
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,4,"While her performance has been noted for its gutsy bravado, it cannot overcome Hall's atrocious American accent. To make matters worse, her 'r's are so exaggerated as to be annoying. By a half hour in, I was reaching for the volume control to tone down her abrasive voice. This is the thing: Hall has a great, natural timbre to her vocal chords. But this time she is not up to par when it comes to accents. My ears began to hurt and I had a hard time finishing this movie. Such a pity because her performance is otherwise topnotch. I guess because this was based on true events, the storytellers couldn't have her be a recent transplant from the UK."

",2017-01-25 00:00:00,8,"This review of Christine is spoiler free **** (4/5) She's an incredible actress, but it seems Hollywood has no idea what to do with Rebecca Hall sure enough she has gained some recognition by being involved in some massive hits such as The Town and Iron Man 3, she was outstanding in those films but they were only supporting roles which didn't fully show her acting capability. However in Christine it is a chance to show what she's like as the lead, she completely immerses herself as Christine Chubbuck a real-life TV news field reporter who wanted to extend her career by trying to sensationalize the news back in the 1970s, but she suffered from a spate of vicious depression attacks until finally committing suicide on live television in 1974 aged just 29. Some actresses don't fully show the complexities of depression on the big screen, so when it came to the casting process indie director Antonio Campos made the right choice with Hall, she is absolutely sensational as Chubbuck.The film focuses on the last few days of her life, we first meet our central character in the middle of the news studio trying to configure some important news footage, she's hard-working and confident when it comes to choosing stories she always makes the right choice on the other hand her boss, Michael (Tracy Letts) who's mantra is ""If it bleeds, it leads"" he doesn't seem to think so as he asks her to improve her footage, to sensationalize the news. At first she loves the idea and tries to go for some very different footage such as crime stories to get viewers watching , but t turns out to be too much for her when she starts to get stomach pains her doctor says it could be that she is pregnant but she disagrees, she thinks it's all done to stress. So she just let's it pass, and carries on with her job. Christine starts to have a very bad time at work, she goes with it by communicating to her fellow co-workers such as her best friend Jean (Maria Dizzia) who says the best way to deal with stress is to have a bowl of ice-cream, and George (Michael C. Hall) her love interest, he tries to introduce herself to him properly but she's not always the most approachable person.At one point, as her stress gets worse it starts to affect her job, it's here when we see the full power of her anger when she gets stressed at work, it doesn't take much to tip over the edge she decides that she has had enough and argues with her boss at work it doesn't go well. She starts to become ill from depression, she becomes very cruel, divisive, Hall is so good in this role she makes it so hard to look away, the message becomes clear here this is the role Rebecca Hall was born for. Sure enough, Michael C. Hall and Tracy Letts make a decent impact with their performances but its Hall's film she is phenomenal from start to finish, as Campos shows her in a whole new light that no one has ever seen before. Christine isn't a fun film, its depressive, it's sad and it's fiery but its Hall's performance that keeps the film going, this is the best she has ever been.VERDICT: Hall gives a phenomenal performance in a film that's more entertaining than it was originally intended to be, it's cruel, provocative and is effortlessly thrilling. Christine is one of the best films of the year."
" Woman on the edge
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,8,"Based on the true story of Christine Chubbuck, a 70s era news reporter in Sarasota who committed suicide by shooting herself live on-air, Christine the movie is a very focused quiet character piece which does a really good job making you feel empathy towards its lead character. That lead character is played by Rebecca Hall (excellent). There is something slightly ""off"" about her Christine, compared to everyone else. She's a little too intense, a little too abrasive. She frequently battles her boss (Tracy Letts), because he wants her to do grittier new pieces while she's focused more on long term personal interest stories. Still, her intelligence shines through. She's frequently told how smart she is, and she does have a few friends at the station, people who understand that despite her awkwardness she's a nice person. What this film really does best is highlight how depression warps your mind and makes every obstacle insurmountable. The movie is filled with people who have experienced sadness and have personal struggles of their own, or people who are reaching out to Christine, who like her and love her and want to help her, but Christine is trapped in her own bubble of pain. Very intelligent movie that's more interested in the life of it's lead character than the way in which she died."
" If it bleeds, it leads
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,10,"I've noticed since this film came out that there's a lot of psychiatric labels getting thrown around about Christine Chubbuck, mostly from people who are using the DSM-5 handbook to try to find some sort of inherited illness to blame her actions on, especially bipolar, aspberger's and manic depression. This is the way we try to understand things like this in modern society. We try to find a chemical imbalance, we suggest that if she were medicated the outcome all would've been different, we suggest that she was born with a mental problem that drove her to her actions... but I think Christine was just an unfortunate product of her environment. She was definitely depressed, I don't think anybody can doubt that after what she did on live television. But I don't think she was bipolar, I don't think it was as simple as that. I think she had a lot on her plate, I think she was surrounded by all the underlying darkness behind the psychedelic Seventies, I think her competitive career was quite difficult to deal with and I believe that, albeit disturbing, Christine's actions were about making a statement about, to quote her final words, ""blood and guts"" in television.""How can you be too sympathetic?"" asks her colleague, Andrea, during the intro of the film as Christine is criticizing herself. Throughout the film, Christine displays a great deal of compassion, a love of children and a joy in doing positive human interest stories. As we all know though, the Seventies was quite a depressing era. We had the Cambodian Genocide, we had key parties, people doing drugs to ignore the sadness around them, the Vietnam War had just happened, times were changing, and the news was becoming more about sensationalism and exploitation. Maybe Christine just felt too much in an unfeeling world. As much as she tried to be cheerful, her career was requiring of her more and more to take advantage of the misery of others for ratings, and on top of that, she discovers that she will most likely never be able to have a baby of her own, the one thing she wanted more than anything else. It seems like nothing she does in the film is ever good enough for anybody else, and everybody has their own idea of what will help Christine's ""moods"", from anxiety pills to therapy to a bowl of ice cream. Everybody has their own way of coping that works for them, but nobody really knows Christine as a person outside of her career. I really felt bad for the weatherman, Steve, while I was viewing the film. Despite him being a minor character, he frequently tries the one thing that nobody else is doing - to just listen to her and understand her. ""I've gotta agree with Christine on this one,"" he tells the station manager upon the idea of exploiting violence in the media. He offers to have lunch with her, he tries to talk to her, but at this point she has already formulated her dark plans. The final nail in the coffin for Christine is when the man she loves, George, is promoted over her and reveals that he loves the blonde secretary of the station over Christine, seeing her more as a co-worker than a romantic interest. This devastates Christine and finally she makes her ultimate decision.The acting in this film is top-of-the-line; Rebecca Hall pulls off a difficult role with ease and makes it impossible to take your eyes off of her even throughout her final moments. This film is very authentic too, evoking Seventies nostalgia through the use of old newsroom equipment, super 8 film, bright Kodachrome-like colors and that great old retro music that today's autotuned pop crud just can't hold a candle to. I found myself crying in the end, not so much for Christine, but for the people she left behind. None of them truly understood her but they all loved her and admired her... too bad she didn't see it. They all experience shock and grief in such a harrowing and realistic way that is rare for films of the 21st century to display. Most films in this day and age that deal with this type of subject matter often fall to the level of a corny Lifetime movie, but Christine is hauntingly powerful and emotional, sometimes, even funny... and so human and real. It will make you feel like you were right there in the newsroom with her.This film is without a doubt one of my favorite films of the decade, and instead of trying to analyze Christine with pop psychology, we should instead try to understand her surroundings and her life. We are too quick to label, misdiagnose and medicate the mentally ill. Maybe Christine just wanted a person to tell her, ""I understand you and we can get through this together."" There's such a stigma around mental illness that tells us ""it's all in their heads, it's a chemical imbalance, pills and drugs will cure it all"". We want to hide it away, not change the negativity in the world. As this film displays, Christine just wanted to bring a little cheerfulness into the world and she was told, ""if it bleeds, it leads"". She was sounding an alarm, we just didn't hear it in time. In 2017, the digital age, we feed off of negativity and tragedy, from exploitative talk shows to alarmist internet news. Social media has made it even easier for people to exploit the nice and innocent and naive. From Amanda Todd to internet trolling, negativity is thriving now more than ever - so we all need to learn from Christine Chubbuck, even if it's difficult to come to terms with why she would do such a thing. I am no expert on her, I never knew her, but anybody who views this film will realize that the real Christine Chubbuck had something to say."
" Wow this film gives you a huge emotional punch like no other!
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,7,"This film left me speechless and crying in parts, even though I mistakenly researched the film before watching it, is was still left with a number of mixed emotions. I can't remember a film having such a deep and traumatising effect on me, it is truly one of the saddest stories on film. Obviously don't research anything about this film before seeing it because it will probably shock you.Firstly the film as a whole, is good / OK, its fine but it can get a little slow here and there. It was a story that I'd never heard of which is unbelievable really, but probably due to the fact it was before my time and didn't happen in my country. As mentioned I researched the film a little before watching it due to its really good trailer and yep ruined to ending and all the overbearing issues in the film, but was still interesting in how it was going to be brought to screen. The directing is OK nothing groundbreaking but I think a very personal and thought provoking film like this doesn't need anything out of this world. The supporting cast are all fine and average characters that you can sort of connect with, some obviously more than others. There is a really good close, family like feeling in the news station that the characters have with each other, which is an interesting dynamic. So overall the film is good, I can now see why this isn't getting as much buzz as I thought it was because this film stands on one performance.Rebecca Hall in my opinion is a very talented and often underrated actor, who deserves bigger roles, this film only backs up my claim. This is personally the best performance I think she has done in her career so far, due to the complexities of the character she is portraying, Christine. Whether you are a man or woman, or have dealt with some of what she is going through or all of what he is going through, this film will hit you very hard. I can say from personal experience some of her social situations or mannerisms are perfectly portrayed on screen because I can see myself in that situation doing the same thing. If you have never suffered from depression or any mental health issue this film might make it easier for you to understand it a bit more. There is so much to this character that can't be put into words the sorrow and surprising anger that I personally had towards her. I never ever had a film made me shout out loud in anger because I want the character to do something so badly or just speak to someone about her problems, but I also know how difficult that is. This character is easy to connect with as the audience because she genuinely wants to be happy and you want her to be happy as well, she is in now way a horrible person who had done something wrong, she has done nothing to deserve the situation she finds herself in. It actually made me sick to my stomach the ending to the film and how easy to it could have been to change and find help, it is truly a social injustice. Your mind will be overwhelmed with emotions, like mine is now, that you want to express and can't. 100% this film will make you cry or make you just feel horrible and if you don't then you aren't human. All in all this film banks on the performance of Rebecca Hall which is fantastic and should be championed more than it is, however the rest of the film can be a little lack lustre. I think this film needed a couple of more characters to be a bit more interesting or relatable or for the story at the news station to be a bit more, meat to the bone. Saying that, if that is what happened in the true story then it should be changed for entertainment purposes. Finally I think the ending of the film could have been tackled a little better instead of just grinding to a halt, like the film makers run out of time. 70% out of 100 the performance of Rebecca Hall, the story and the emotional reaction I had to film make it a good watch, I will never forget the first time I watched this film. You should definitely watch this film for the social injustice it is and the risks and dangers surrounding metal health issues."
" Surprising, relevant, unsettling, overall great
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,9,"As someone who tried for years to write his own screenplay telling the story of Christine Chubbuck and settled instead for a paranormal Chris Chubbuck figuring heavily into the novel He Who Shall Remain Shameless, I was greatly anticipating this film--and it delivered. I've read complaints leveled at the movie that it doesn't really tell the story of Christine Chubbuck--but what IS the story of Christine Chubbuck, really? It's our story, the story of all of us, now more than ever...After all, there's a little bit of Christine Chubbuck in all of us, isn't there? Antonio Campos's film deals with ideas as well as people...the ideas we're living with now at the end of the 2010s. ""White condition...yellow condition...orange condition..."" Christine watching the security camera watching her. ""If it bleeds, it leads..."" If this movie had been made in 1976, as a companion piece to Network, it would have been prophetic. As it stands, it's still prophetic, or at least prescient. That Rebecca Hall comes closer than anyone could to bringing Christine Chubbuck back to life is a testament to her considerable talents. J. Smith Cameron, Maria Dizzia, and Tracy Letts all turn in strong supporting performances. Ultimately, this is an uncomfortable movie that is not always easy to watch--but watching it is well worth your time, if you care to think about what's going on now."
" Rebecca Hall gives one of the year's best performances without a doubt
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,7,"On July 15th, 1974, Christine Chubbuck committed suicide on live television. On the evening news on a local Florida television station, Chubuck calmly informed her viewers that ""In keeping with Channel 40's policy of bringing you the latest in 'blood and guts', and in living color, you are going to see another first—attempted suicide."" She raised a gun to her head and fired. This was a woman who battled depression and paranoia, and the thought of exploring such a sad story in a feature film feels at times misguided and yet often transcendent. While I don't necessarily understand the merit of underpinning such a dark and trivial moment in history for the purposes of a film, I can't help but admire the art.Antonio Campos directs this smaller indie film that was released on the film festival circuit earlier this fall. To be honest I am surprised this movie hasn't generated more buzz this season, but I suppose topic matter and budgets oftentimes prohibit such things. Whether or not you have heard of Chubbuck's sad story, Campos nonetheless works to analyze the torment that was behind this woman's struggle and the boiling points of the human psyche.Rebecca Hall is our star, and when I say that this is a remarkable bit of acting, believe me. Unrecognizable behind dark eyebrows and a center-part of long hair, I think that this is quite easily one of the year's strongest performances and one I hope is not forgotten come Oscar time. We meet Christine as a driven reporter, oftentimes staying late or editing her segments down to the last few moments before air. She exists on the cusp of the modern news era; when stories began transitioning from human interest to violence, shock. The station manager sees a decline in ratings and asks his reporters to seek out more controversial news. ""If it bleeds, it leads."" A few years ago the movie ""Nightcrawler"" worked to figure out the public's fascination with gore. Christine could easily be it's origin story.Not only has Christine focused her news stories on things like local chickens and the building of freeways, but the owner of the company (an aloof John Cullom) visits the station in hopes of recruiting anchors for a new station in Baltimore. Faced with the possibility of becoming a legitimate reporter, Christine has no choice but to succumb. She buys a police scanner and stays up late nights, searching for breaking news. At one point she hears about a house fire and rushes to the scene with a camera in hand. She interviews the resident in tight closeup and fails to even get a shot of the flames. Even in peril, she can't make the transition.Hall portrays Christine as a lonely woman with glimmers of hope. During the day she volunteers at a children's hospital and puts on puppet shows to the joy of kids. She seems to enjoy it, too. Her mother is much too interested in finding a new date than to remember to meet her daughter for a lunch date. Oftentimes she plays out scenes alone, meditative, working on keeping her positive facade in prime condition. Just below the surface we see a growing menace and distance that ultimately leads to the chilling finale.If you are to see Christine, see it for Rebecca Hall. What a wonderful morning it would be to hear her name called out as an Oscar nominee. She's that good. The film overall sways in and out of interest, trekking through a story that seems constructed only to justify an end when a woman kills herself on live TV. What do we learn from the story? Where is the deeper understanding of depression and mental illness? Rebecca Hall keeps our interest with absolute hypnotism but in doing so allows us to sidestep the fact that this is a flawed movie at it's core."
" Marvelous piece of work all round.
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,10,Perhaps this might throw some light on how much quality is in Christine...It passed muster...and then some...when viewed under the influence and precise guidance of good hash.Every aspect is top notch...pace in short bursts...awkward tension of spell-binding lengths...performances that weave seamless into our conscious and dance their merry dance...on the dance-floor.Try to give it a chance...this is worthy stuff man.*Bar is closed...people stagger out the crippled the pretty and the proud.*oneleg
" Not a simple review
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,8,"Let's start with a truism.Simple reviews are for simple films. This is not a simple film.On the one hand, you have a drama based on a true story of a reporter in the 70s who had a nervous breakdown and ultimately self-destructed.Films with ""known"" endings are always a challenge because, you have to ask, what is there to hold the attention of the viewer if you already know what happens? Here we have an answer: to hold the attention, we have Rebecca Hall's best-ever performance of her already-solid career. Dressed down, no makeup, she not only disguises her natural beauty (clearly seen in other films she has starred in) but actually creates a character that simultaneously engages and horrifies the viewer at the same time.Her portrayal of real-life reporter Christine Chubbuck is not unlike one of those ""suspense"" films about a time-bomb that needs to be defused before it explodes and takes an entire building with it. The manic energy Hall builds is a show-stopper and one cannot avoid the prediction that this performance will be noticed, and honored, down the road.On an entirely different level, however, director Antonio Campos never misses an opportunity to paint this story against a broader canvas, a canvas that is as appropriate to the events of today -- this review written on the eve of the Trump inauguration -- as it was during the 70s, when incoming president Ford ""pardoned"" outgoing president Nixon.Campos achieves this by clever edits and inserts, the selection of a specific sound bite here, the choice of a special movie Chubbuck watches by herself there (for example, Christine on her free time chooses to watch Carnival of Souls 1962, a film about a heroine who goes quietly insane because she is not sure about who she actually is.) The fact is that the news media is no better today than it was then, and likely much worse. Years ago, MAD MAGAZINE did a satire on the NYT's motto ""all the news that's fit to print,"" re-imagining it as ""all the news that fits, we print."" An argument can be made that the west's news services (90% of which are owned by only six corporations in 2017) are merely glorified ad agencies. At best, they are pushing endorphins. At worst (check out the 2016 scandal over the DNC) they are pushing ideas into people's heads that are partial and biased.If Ms. Chubbuck were alive today, one doubts if she would be any more pleased with the job she so desperately tried to perform.Highly recommended."
" Christine (2016)
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,7,"No, not the John Carpenter classic. The minute I heard about this film I was very excited to see this film. For those who are not familiar with the story, this film is based on the suicide of Christine Chubbuck. Christine was a depressed reporter who was going through troubling issues in her private and professional life culminating with her live on air suicide in 1974. Its a touchy, eerie and fairly disturbing subject, yet the film needed to not shy away from what happened and recreate the life of Christine Chubbuck, while not shying away from the gruesome event.I've got to say, I was very impressed with this film. You cannot look away from this film at all. Its captivating all the way through even the hard to watch bits. Christine Chubbuck's pain, anguish, and disillusionment is portrayed perfectly by Rebecca Hall. I've never seen a more convincing performance from her. She seems to completely embody the character especially during the uncomfortable bits. A shout out to Tracy Letts as the hot tempered Michael. There are so many great moments from Hall including a volatile argument with Letts (and a similar one with her on screen mother). Wish Hall was getting more buzz for her performance, it may be up there with the best I've seen all year.The film feels like something set in the 70s. There's plenty of shadows in the picture quality and the color is somewhat muted. It helps add to a dark and foreboding atmosphere. The little things really add to the experience of the film. Hall is in almost every frame as we witness her dark character study. Her health problems impinge her, the pressures of her work keep suffocating her, her love life never pans out, any attempt to move up in life goes down in flames.. we witness it all. You can't help but feel sorry for Chrstine; you can tell she is going through a hard time and a lot of it is unjust. We stand in anticipation as everything culminates to her death and the payoff is good.This film does a good job of being unabashedly scary at times. There are few glimmering glimpses for Christine, but these moments fade just as soon as they come. Hope quickly turns to hopelessness. The negative aspects weigh up and bring you down and its inescapable. Its scary to think about how a lot of people have so much going on in their life and how people around them fail to notice what they are thinking. Support services are really important.Before rambling too much, the final moments are great. Christine seems resolved and at a stage of acceptance with everything around her. I guess this would have made the final events even more shocking in real life. The sudden and shocking nature of the suicide is caught quite well. I do wish the film ended with her shooting herself and her dropping to the floor, would have been more powerful. While the film meanders a bit and doesn't always seem focused, I am more than impressed with the end result.7.5/10"
