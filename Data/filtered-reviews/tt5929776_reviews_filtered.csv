" Very well made movie
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,8,"The film before the flood brings light to many of the negative effects of climate change and shows how we are continuing to ignore the facts given to us by a majority of scientists. In the film Leonardo DiCaprio travels around the world to see the effects of climate change first hand and talk to many experts and influential people about climate change. It starts off with a great reference to the garden of earthly delights and shows the relationship between our current situation to that off the painting. Then it goes on to talk about why we haven't tried to stop climate change, the main reason being political. Many politicians in the white house deny climate change because they are profiting off of the companies that are affecting the climate negatively. I wish the film would have spent more time showing us who these people are so we can take what they say with a grain of salt, but they do do a great job at explaining what needs to be done in my opinion. They talk about how we should make a carbon tax and like China convert to renewable energy as quickly as possible. But even if we make massive changes to the use of fossil fuels the temperature would still rise, what will happen is we will lessen the damage done by climate change. They cover the Paris agreement which we know now didn't have the effect we thought it would and the U.S. has left the Paris agreement which is a huge loss because we are a huge player in the world.The film also covers how the ice in Greenland is becoming darker meaning it becomes its own heat source which will speed the melting. It gives different peoples views on climate change from all around the world. One of these would be people that live on small islands that will soon be flooded completely and are already showing signs of the sea rising. Another being the effects that mass industrialization has had on Beijing's population. One part that captured my interest was the burning of forests in Indonesia, not only is it having a negative effect on the climate but it also affects the animals that live there. Coral reefs are beginning to go lifeless which has an effect on the people that catch fish near the reefs as a primary source of food. The most terrifying thing that was in the film is the part when they talk about the effects of the climate rising only 4 degrees Celsius. But overall this film was a good one that I believe everyone should watch because it shows you the effects of global warming and why some people don't want to help stop it from getting worse than it already is. There are many parts in the movie that will have you shocked at how some people in the world live or how some corporations do not care that much about the environment but only care about the money destroying it makes them. It shows just how corrupt some places like Indonesia are and also shows how we are taking steps to combat climate change like Tesla's Gigafactory. It is a must watch for any human being that cares about their children and the future generations to come after them."
" Great documentary that clearly shows and helps understand about our world and what we can do to help our world.
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,10,"Before the flood was a documentary movie that took place in 2016. One of the main characters in this movie included Leonardo DiCaprio as he traveled and really understood what was going on throughout the world over a about two-year journey. Leonardo DiCaprio in the movie seemed like he wanted to better the world and really help others understand which was also part of this project. In our project of the seven revolutions we had to understand specific revolutions and decide how they would impact the world which I feel this movie did extremely well. Through the movie as the characters traveled and went to different places we were able to see how much our world has been changing overtime and struggling with things like resource management and climate change as well as global warming. It can be hard for the world and people like us who don't really see a problem in our daily resources such as water and food but in reality when people like Leonardo DiCaprio traveled the world and realize what was really going on, it taught not only me but every other person watching this documentary a lot about life and how we can improve the environment and the world around us. I also know if you're watching the documentary how there are different communities and places throughout countries like India that are struggling through the revolutions and in general pollution because they don't have much power with an extremely large population. This is affecting them on a daily basis and continuing to grow because nothing is being done about it. Changes will only be made if citizens make them and as an example we learned that it can happen from changing what we have people eat on a daily basis. If we tend to eat less beef and cut it for my diet then there will be less methane produced and would generally be better for the world as the pollution would be greatly decreased. Throughout the documentary, Leonardo DiCaprio talked to many people as he traveled along such as President Obama and the secretary of state who he got opinions from as well. This documentary shows us all the bad and impactful things happening in our world and many of them happen through nature but many things have also been happening because of us, the people living here and causing these problems. I believe that this movie showed a point and expressed that we as the people who need a better world to live in need to start doing something to change the problems and make them less problematic. These benefits want to start occurring by themselves but as Leonardo DiCaprio indirectly as well as directly stated, the population and country/governments need to start making a change. The sooner the change comes along, the better the world will start to become. If we want this effect to take place to be living in a better world, we would need to start taking action now because this will not happen overnight but instead it will take a lot of thinking, time, and problem-solving to reach an ultimate goal. Overall I think that this documentary was worth watching as it has taught me as well as many others who I can explain to what is really happening to the world and about the issues involving climate change, Global warming, resource management, and so much more. If we start today, we can all make a change in bettering the world to a place we would like to live in with possibly no to little problems."
" The messages of Before the Flood
",2020-11-30 00:00:00,10,"Before the Flood, presented by National Geographic, features Leonardo DiCaprio on a journey as a United Nations Messenger of Peace, traveling to five continents and the Arctic to witness climate change firsthand. He goes on expeditions with scientists uncovering the reality of climate change and meets with political leaders fighting against inaction. He also discovers a calculated disinformation campaign orchestrated by powerful special interests working to confuse the public about the urgency of the growing climate crisis. With unprecedented access to thought leaders around the world, DiCaprio searches for hope in a rising tide of catastrophic news.
Greenland is close to entering an irreversible feedback loop of melting. Ice reflects sunlight; water absorbs sunlight. As more of the country's ice turns to water, more sunlight is absorbed, causing more heating, causing more melting, and so on. If Greenland were to melt, it alone would raise global sea levels by several feet. The Arctic ""is like the air conditioning for the Northern Hemisphere,"" says Dr. Enric Sala in the film. ""If it goes away, that's going to change currents, that's going to change weather patterns, it's going to make droughts more catastrophic.""
Current trends suggest that the Earth will warm by more than 4 degrees through man-made climate change. This will lead to catastrophic droughts, the collapse of agricultural belts, the collapse of marine ecosystems, severe storms, and much more.
As oceans absorb CO2, they become warmer and go through a process of acidification. Both events make it harder for coral reefs to form and stay alive. It's likely that reefs will vanish in the decades ahead, reversing a billion years of evolution. Coral reefs are incredibly vibrant ecosystems, fostering a vast range of species and providing food for a billion people around the world. If they collapse, that means a billion people will have to find an alternative source of food.
Because electricity and access to sources of heat are unavailable to hundreds of millions of Indians, they cook food with cow dung that generates heat. This means that there are 700 million people not yet relying on electricity for this task. Putting all of these people ""on the grid"" will dramatically increase its environmental impact - unless the shift is made with sustainable energy.
Cows both consume a lot of resources, and emit lots of dangerous greenhouse gases. In the US, 47% of land is dedicated to food production. Seventy percent of this land is used to grow feed for cattle. Conversely, 1% of that land is used to grow crops for humans.
Cows continuously emit methane, a greenhouse gas 23 times more potent than carbon, as they go about their days.
While addressing climate change depends on making deep structural changes to the world's economies - such as ending fossil fuel extraction - people can accelerate the process in their own lives. These are some ways to make a difference yourselves. Eat less red meat, don't buy products with palm oil because palm oil production drives deforestation, vote for people who support climate action."
" We need changes
",2020-11-16 00:00:00,9,"The National Geographic Channel of the United States invited Leonardo DiCaprio to look for countries and regions with global climate problems and took two years to shoot this documentary aimed at arousing human awareness of the crisis of global warming.It is precisely at this point that some people who are concerned about nature and the destiny of humanity have taken action. The documentary team believes that Leonardo's global influence can make more people see and value it, and the catastrophic consequences of global warming itself deserve more attention. And Leonardo has more than just influence. In the documentary, he uses a natural religious painting that hung on the ceiling above his cradle during his childhood as a traction to explain his understanding of nature and the earth environment. At the beginning of his acting career, he has taken on the responsibility of promoting environmental protection to his fans and those who know him, which is what an influential actor should do.Leonardo followed the filming team to visit countries and regions related to global warming, including the countries with the most serious environmental pollution and carbon emissions, the Arctic and Greenland, where the ice caps are gradually melting, and the sea level. The island countries and coastal cities of some countries affected by the rise. Understand the views of the environmental protection agencies of these countries on these changes. The second place we visited was China. We saw some images that are not normally seen in the news, such as images of armed police suppressing environmental protection demonstrations by the people in Kunming, and images of Beijing elementary school students wearing masks going to school, and China mentioned in the film is a veritable world factory that has undertaken all the manufacturing industries of Western countries, while Beijing and Shandong alone undertake most of the country's industrial manufacturing. Then when they arrived in India, the intuitive feeling was that India was more messy and noisy than China, but maybe we at least saw their messy side. There are 300 million households with one billion people in India without electricity. Leonardo saw the cow dung cake they dried with cow dung as the primary fuel for daily life. During the interview, Leonardo asked Indian female officials whether they would consider asking the government When making recommendations for planning to reduce carbon emissions, female officials confidently produced a statistical data showing that the per capita carbon emissions of the Americans are equivalent to 32 times that of India. She directly pointed out that if neither of you in the United States changes your per capita carbon emissions, we cannot think we should. What's interesting is that this attitude is completely opposite to the attitude given by a Chinese official. The official said to Leonardo: If we can all improve the environment, other countries should do it. This is the style of a big country.Leonardo also followed the team to Greenland and the Arctic to see the melting of the ice sheet with his own eyes. An intuitive feeling is that a detection tube under the Greenland ice sheet has exposed the length of several tens of meters in the past five years. And know how much of this ice sheet continent has melted into the ocean.What is surprising is that the team even interviewed Elon Musk? He is the founder of Tesla, the largest clean energy car brand in the United States. His contribution in clean energy and space technology is second to none. He said that this is like a legend in the technology industry. It's no exaggeration that the character is the authentic version of Iron Man. Leonardo was interviewing Elon Musk in his super battery factory. All problems are not a problem in front of technology. This conversation is a dramatic node from the perspective of the entire documentary.So I think this is a great documentary to help the audience recognize different and true perspectives behind the glaciers of climate change."
" Before the Flood
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,9,"The documentary, Before the Flood, is a nonfictional movie presented by the National Geographic in 2016 and directed by Fisher Stevens. The film is based on the topic of climate change and was created as a cooperation between Stevens, Leonardo DiCaprio, James Packer, Brett Ratner, Trevor Davidoski, and Jennifer Davisson Killoran. This documentary captures, each side of the globe from a three-year venture. In the film, Leonardo DiCaprio is on an excursion as a United Nations Messenger of Peace, going to five mainlands and the Arctic to observe environmental change firsthand. He goes on campaigns with researchers revealing the truth of environmental change and meets with political pioneers battling against inaction. In addition, he also finds a well-planned false propaganda activity by a group of special interests attempting to befuddle the public about the severity of our ongoing climate crisis. Through unprecedented contacts with thought leaders worldwide, DiCaprio looks for hope in the rising trend of this catastrophic crisis. Before the Flood gives us an insight into the changes that our world is currently undergoing due to climate changes. The documentary also provides us with steps that each of our individuals can change to prevent the disturbance of life on our planet. As a society, we should all put to make our community a better place by saving water, energy, and food resources and recycle more.Besides these steps that each one of us can take, the film also encourages the audience to persuade their government officials in supporting the utilization of alternative energy sources, for example, solar power, hydrogen gas, tidal energy, biomass energy, geothermal power, natural gas, nuclear power, hydroelectric energy, wind power, and biofuels. As DiCaprio said in the film, ""We need everyone to demand bold action from their political leaders and to elect representatives who have their best interests at heart, not the interests of corporations to perpetuate a cycle of greed and destruction. This documentary shows how interconnected the fate of all humanity is - but also the power we all possess as individuals to build a better future for our planet."" (DiCaprio). Climate change is a topic that Leonardo DiCaprio concerns about for many years. In fact, 30% of the people in India are still undergoing living without any access to electricity and the internet. For the US to inform India to cut down its emissions without cutting on our own country is not a solution to this problem.Although solving this climate change problem is a huge step to go through, but if each of our individual take a small step every day, starting from changing our primary source of energy to an effective alternative energy source the climate change problem will be relieved. Climate change is currently building an impact on our lives in the forms of heatwaves, droughts, temperature rising, frost-free season, rising sea levels, and intense hurricanes in areas on our planet. As an individual in this society, we should all work together to prevent our planet going n to this disturbance of climate change and global warming."
" We are on time to act
",2020-10-12 00:00:00,10,"Before the Flood ReviewBefore the flood is a Documental produced by Leonardo DiCaprio and talks about climate change and how important it is that the world is aware of that.
At the beginning we can see The Gardens of Earthly Delights , this painting has three panels, and it's basically the past, the present and the possible future that the earth will have if we don't act on climate change.
DiCaprio traveled to five continents and the Arctic to witness climate change with his own eyes. Before the Flood shows us the reality of climate change around the world and how it is advancing strongly, and in my opinion it is shocking how, despite the importance and worrying of climate change, politically powerful people who appear in this documentary speak confidently about how this problem is of minimal importance, people such as Donald Trump.
Personally, I consider myself an informed person regarding this issue, but this documentary helped me open my eyes to global warming and all the problems that it brings, and I sincerely believe that everyone should see this documentary, in order to make a call to address this great problem and not only to have it in our conscience.Global warming is real and is happening now, and it is difficult to understand it from our homes, but this great documentary shows everything that should concern us. The pollution of the oceans, the extinction of animals, the breakdown of the ozone layer, global warming and many others, this problem is caused by humans, little by little, we are getting late but we can still act."
" A good start for a change
",2020-10-12 00:00:00,10,"Climate change is one of the most important issues that society should be aware of, before watching ¨Before the flood"" I used to have other ideas about contamination and global warming, I thought that all this problem that we have nowadays was thanks to the creation and common use of plastic, meat industries and greenhouse gases coming out from factories. After watching this film everything that I actually contaminate with my daily consume of oil hit me and I started to feel worried about where are we going to end if we continue through this path. Before the flood is an environmental film presented by National Geographic in which Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the most important features. He is named as the United Nations Messenger of Peace, in this film DiCaprio traveled to 5 different continents and the Arctic to witness climate change on firsthand. He went to different expeditions with scientists and meet with political leaders fighting against inaction, this film exposes the reality of climate change and try to show us all the different repercussions that the human being has left over the years. This is a film that everyone should watch, you will have the knowledge of everything that had happened during the last century and how we got to where we are now. In my opinion this is one of the most important issues that society is currently facing, this problem must be heard by everyone and all this information should be public, everyone must know what we are doing to our planet and where we are guiding our future.
This film is one of the best that I have ever seen, I was shocked due all the information and damage about our planet and oil industries, after watching this film I realized that everyone that lives in this planet should be concern about this topic, watching this film might be a good start for making a change in our routines and our daily consume."
" A Little Change
",2020-10-12 00:00:00,10,"Before the flood is a documentary about the global climatic change like a problem for all the hummanity. In this documentary we saw Leonardo Di Caprio travel to the six continents for see the global warming with his own eyes. He met with world leaders like Barack Obama and Pope Francis to talk about this problem and do somenthing for the enviroment.
This documentary is really interesing because I knew about this problem but I didnt know how big is. In the film we can see people who is very inquiet with global warming, but we can also see important people who do not believe in this problem. Also I think this film is enfoqued to the political leaders and what they do for the global warming.
I think this documentary should be seen by all the people because a big problem is in the world, the poles are melting, animals are becoming extinct, the forests are burning, the crops are flooded, the sea level rises and more problems on the list.
Taking action on climate change is urgent and the documentary reflects that well.
In addition, the fact of being starred by someone famous like Leonardo Di Caprio makes this message reach many more people.
We have to be more ecofriendly, the society should be educate ecologically since kids to have betters habits and be more friendly with the nature.
This documentary is from 4 years ago, but this problems are mencioned many years ago. This probllem will increase, if we dont do anything now, later we wont be able to do anything
I give to this documentary 10 stars rating because this is not like others film. This film doesnt just detail the problem, it also gives you solutions and ways to avoid generate pollution."
" ¿How did we get to this?
",2020-10-12 00:00:00,10,"I feel that this documentary makes you think more about the global warning because the people are not aware of the problems that the world already has.
It is interesting how at the beginning they show you the painting that talks about the earth because it is something unique and different.
One of the points that Leonardo tries to demonstrate is that there are still people who do not believe that climate change is happening, people like Donald trump.
I think it's interesting how an actor like Leonardo DiCaprio can give such a powerful message and visit melting ice fields, flies over a bleak petroleum landscape and pats an Indonesian elephant.
This movie promises from the outset to detail specific things people can do to decrease environmental damage, but those suggestions are few. An important point mentioned is that you should eat less meat and stop buying products that use palm oil.
The movie wants to motivate individual changes in behavior, but there's a good amount in it that might tell you not to try.
My score for this movie is 5/5 because I really like the way things are shown."
" We are the solution
",2020-10-12 00:00:00,10,"Before the blood is a film that deals efficiently and clearly with the impacts of global warming. Most of us are aware of these impacts and this film shows us that we do not know the real problems that these impacts generate on our planet. This film was produced by National Geographic and starring by Leonardo Dicaprio, actor and the United Nations Messenger of peace. Leonardo travels around the world showing us the problems that are looming ahead our world thanks to global warming and talks with people who are involved in the problems that this change caused. This film appeals to make people aware that global warming is real and this needs to have efficient and quick solutions.I think the most interesting person interviewed is Gidon Eshel, a research professor in environmental physics at Bard College, who studies the effects of agriculture on climate. He says that a simple change that all of us can make to reduce greenhouse gases is simply change the diet, reduce the consumption of beef for other options such as chicken and vegetables. It is incredible that cows are a significant factor in the emission of greenhouse gases such as methane. This topic is interesting because it offers us a solution to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases that only depends on us and not on politicians or governmentsEveryone should see this documentary especially children and teenagers because in the end they will have the power to decide what is best for the planet.I think that the issue of global warming is very severe, as the secretary of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon said, climate change is coming much faster than we think. So if we don't create and implement the solutions to this problem as quickly as posible, it will be too late.I give this documentary 10/10 due to its informative and impactful goal. It makes you reflect and think that we have to find a solution to global warming. In addition, it is interesting that a person like Leonardo dicaprio worries about global warming because thanks to his celebrity status it will make many people aware that the issue of global warming is real and dangerous."
" ""You are the last best hope of Earth. We ask you to protect it or we, and all living things we cherish, are history."" (Leonardo Dicarpio).
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,10,"This was probably one of the most interesting documentaries that I have ever seen. There are plenty articles, movies, trailers, short films, pictures and books that talk about this big issue. Exist information about this and how to try to help the earth, our home, and you know what? Most of us ignore the problem at the end.Honestly, after an hour and 36 minutos of duration, I ended up in room trying to reconsider what I'm doing. I was sad, guilty and considered myself kind of a hypocrite not only because I´m thinking about the future or because I would like to have children and leave them a beautiful world, if not, because I want to participate and leave my mark in this planet. At least try to help humanity to reason with the point of view about our nature.I think Dicaprio, did such an amazing job talking about a problem in front of politicians at least and as an actor he's trying to convince us about the real problem, acting or not, he is making an effort to reconsider our actions against the world and the life around us and what a better idea to do this, through the art of cinematographic. Visually, this is a very pretty film and the editing is also amazing., This movie offers us a very clear message that impacts us in a simple way in our minds. Like the part about how people in India describe their lives while in the United States are continuing to live their kind of luxury or common lives like nothing really matters.But the questions are, why after many films, articles and news about this problem we don't support those who are doing something, how can we contribute? I think the message is clear at the end , when Leonardo's speech starts with many pieces of advice to contribute. Another answer is in The Garden of Earthly Delights paint is a summary about the planet's life and the truth about the process of a common life as well. In fact, it is also in the earth's model of the Dr Piers. Starting a thought provoking feeling that makes us feel unsettling about the future and a big catastrophe. But the thing is, that also we have to think about our present and the people around, what about the people who don't have the resources because of our fault, what about the animals and the poverty around us.Stop thinking about the past, don't start to make plans if you are not sure about the future, YOUR future. Now is the answer, the present that we are living will be the difference in a while, just don´t be afraid to do it. I mean, is in our hands and we have the control to take our actions to the next level. We have to take this powerful message to the actions and show this kind of masterpiece to those people who don't believe in the reality of this problem, to our families, friends and coworkers. I add 10 stars because I think the idea of put the name of Dicaprio in a environment film reinforces more the curiosity to watch this film, and thanks to him and to the director and the staff that realized this project we can see the reality of the most amazing thing in the universe, the planet and the sadness problem that open another kind of issues, the global warming."
" Knowing more about what is happening with our home
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,9,"In this super interesting and necessary documentary, we learn and are reminded of the importance of our planet and ours resources. For People that are not informed about the severity of the situation that we are living, this movie is amazing.This movie tells us about climate change and how we are using the natural resources with the real statistical numbers and statements from people who live in the reported conditions.In my opinion, everybody needs to see the movie, but the most important group of people that have to get the information that the movie gives are the children and the teenagers because they will have the power in the future to do something for the world.The most interesting person in the movie is the Indian woman who showed us the real life in India and did not hesitate to criticize how the people live and how they use the resources in the USA and compared with India, in front of Leonardo DiCaprio.This rating is because the movie is extremely necessary for our communities nowadays, mostly because we have to use the time that we have here to make the world better and the movie alert us how the world is now and show us how we can change for the best."
" Let's see what we've done
",2020-06-02 00:00:00,10,"This movie is definitely impressive and shocking.The main cast of this documentary is surprisingly one of the most famous actors, Reonald DiCaprio. He went to places around the world which clearly showed 'the scars of Earth' we humans have caused, and talked with people who are engaged in these problems.There are numerous problems in the film. However, Gidon Eshel, who researches the negative effect of cattles on the environment, especially impressed me because I had no idea how cattles are relevant to the emission of greenhouse gases. They bring about not only deforestation but also the increase of methane in the air. One molecule of methane is equivalent to 23 of Carbon dioxide in terms of greenhouse effect. It was so shocking for me. As he said, what we can do immediately could be to refrain from eating beef.If you have just heard about climate change and don't have experience of feeling it, this movie will be the best way to experience it. You can't stop thinking about this problem. Moreover, your perspective to everyday life might change.I have to rate this movie like this because this is one of the most thought-provoking movies I've ever watched. It must have impacts on many people regardless of whether they are optimistic, pessimistic or even indifferent about the future of the Earth."
" A thought-provoking documentary about the reality we are facing nowadays
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,10,"""Before the Flood"" is a movie that carefully explains what climate change is and what the causes and consequences of this phenomenon are. Leonardo DiCaprio spends the whole film traveling all around the world, meeting with different scientists and environmental experts to get to know deeply about these issues and possible solutions to mitigate or reduce people's ecological footprints.During his journey, DiCaprio met the professor of economics at Harvard University named Gregory Mankiw. In my opinion, Mankiw was one of the most interesting pundits who DiCaprio talked to because he is not an environmental scientist. As I mentioned before, Gregory Mankiw is an economic expert who is concerned about this reality, even though he is Republican, and gives a useful solution to making people switch to renewable energy by adding a carbon tax.Personally, this movie had a huge positive impact on me because I was not clear about this topic, and I did not even know how dangerous it was. Life will be catastrophic if we do not start implementing ways to counter the degradation of the environment. This movie is perfect for all those people that think climate change is a theoretical problem, and for those who know about it but do not pay attention or try to contribute to making it better.""Before the Flood"" is a documentary that shows a real issue, and if we do not try to change now, it will be too late. I gave ten stars as a rating because I think the director did an incredible job; it is a thought-provoking film that may cause people to change their course of action."
" Personal opinion
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,10,"Before the flood is a documentary about the climate change and the reality that the majority of us don't see because we live in some places where we aren't directly affected for it, though the truth is that there are many countries, suffering the consequences of consumerist countries.This is presented by National Geographic, features Leonardo DiCaprio who traveling to different continents to talk to important people like John Kerry, President Obama, Pope Francis, Sunita Narain between others. Its Running time is around 93 minutes, don't take much time of us, it's important that everyone watches it to create awareness from our homes. Before the Flood is an educational and advocacy documentary for all of us.But Before the Flood isn't simply interested in showing how terrible everything is. It also gives solutions that we can apply in our habits and in general in our lives. When Leonardo asked to Obama if a president who doesn't believe in climate change could cancel the policies he's already implemented, President Obama says the truth has a way of catching up with you. The film points out that public opinion tends to influent to political opinion, using gay marriage as an example Obama was against it when it wasn't popular, then for it when the majority of the country approved he came round. Thus, the future is in the hands of the peopleThis movie really change my mind I hope I can remember the most shocking scenes when I forget to take care the environment with small actions that can contribute with the big transformation and make the difference. The scenes of big burnings left an impression on me because I think in all the animals, trees and ecosystems that are dying for our blame, it is not fair that innocent people and animals pay for our bad actions, we have to change our customs to make a better world.Climate change is real, and it's scary. I give it 10 stars because of the argument is very important if we want to salvage the world, continue with our existence and leave a better world to our future generations."
" Earth.
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,8,"This is one of the best documentaries about the current climate crisis on the market of documentary filmmaking.Leonardo is doing great work with great initiatives. I appreciate all who were in front, and behind, the camera on this one."
" THOUGHT PROVOKING AWARENESS ON CLIMATE CHANGE
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,10,"The modern times have witnessed the drastic change in the lives of people all over the globe. We are busy with our daily schedules and barely get time to spare as leisure. In this stuffed life of tasks , to-do lists and seldom recreation , we humans never realized how selfish we have become. All we care is our lives, all that bothers us is our career, family, properties, etc. Concern for the environment, nature , degrading bio-systems and eco-systems is barely found in average human culture.This documentary throws light on all such undiscussed issues. This documentary shouts out loud, that our busy lives are of no importance to our well being, if we don't take immediate steps towards the biggest challenge - CLIMATE CHANGE.Leonardo Di Caprio , did an amazing job trying to spread the word about Global Warming which is depicted through this documentary . It was an extreme necessity to call out those governments which try to paint CLIMATE CHANGE as a fake movement or a hoax just for maintaining economical profits. The documentary serves the purpose of rising a sense of fear among people by showing the vast amount of melted ice . It also shared expert's opinions on the necessary steps to be taken by us like consumption of an alternative meat to beef, since livestock produces 80% of GREEN HOUSE GASES.The documentary explains every issue with possible solutions in a scientific manner. Leonardo Di Caprio , the messenger of peace and Global ambassador of Climate change, as designated by the UNITED NATIONS did a fantastic job out of his busy actor life. The documentary informs us about the PARIS AGREEMENT with details . It gives us a clear picture of the possible climate goals."
" the documentary Overpriced exposed the carbon tax as a scam
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,6,"I think im being more than fair with a 6/10 but a lot of people see this as a joke this could have been a much better movie if the content was changed without pushing an agenda that is against the principles of democracy! I'm shocked how Before the Flood didn't provide practical solutions to replace fossil fuels, I made the documentary Overpriced which showed how the carbon tax is a scam, Overpriced showed how hemp can replace fossil fuels, why couldn't Before the Flood share info like that? My film can't reach the audience this has so Before the Flood totally wasted another opportunity. Weed is legal in California its not like nobody there has any idea! I don't know if its drugs your taking or drugs you need to be taking, do something!No wonder people believe in conspiracy theories when obviously there is a media blackout to keep useful information away from the people while the political agendas ie: carbon tax agenda gets promoted with little representation from alternative viewpoints.Shame on You Leonardo and everyone involved for not supporting the truth we could have saved so many lives but instead we get the mainstream distracting environmental activism away from solutions you people support fossil fuels but not hemp? well can't blame Leonardo completely when he went to a good school, and the schools and teachers haven't been teaching the good information but if he willfully ignores the information it's like why does he pretend to care about the environment just be honest if you don't want lots of hemp plants to replace fossil fuels then admit you don't care about the environment.Sorry for my rant had to prove my point but thats my short review of Before the Flood, nothing else comes to mind right now really other than good cinematography music etc."
" DiCaprio, really!
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,7,"Well , here's the thing.
Great issue to be addressed no doubt.
But I was bewildered by the real character of DiCaprio during the program, He seemed so shallow and had nothing to add or improvise except for some cliche words here and there.
As if he just lost his real character after portraying all of these characters during his career and developed this blank one !"
" Oh please Leo fix us pretty please

" Climate change is coming
",2020-03-16 00:00:00,9,The documentary has an important message for everyone that is taking care of the environmentThe film shows us the problems that are looming ahead our world thanks to the climate change. The planet is getting worse and worse and nowadays we see a lot of people worried and struggling to make the world great againActually one of the biggest impressions on me was also the person that I found most interesting-it was Pope Francis insomuch as it is quite astonishing to hear from him that people need to believe in scientists because the church and religion have always been against science.My rating is 9/10 because I think is good that someone like Leonardo di Caprio talk about these issues because the message can be received by his followers and more people thanks to his fame.
" before the flood
",2020-03-12 00:00:00,9,"This movie is amazing, it begin giving a little introduction on how the global warming and climate change has been affected the environment, and also how we have contribute to the damage, with our daily habits and the things that we usually do. There's something that really impressed me, is how far have we gone on this topic that all people around the world are becoming more conscious about it, but there still people that deny these problems just because of their interest behind the industries that produce fossil fuels and in one or other way give benefits to the politicians those who deny all this. This also make me think on how our lifestyle can affect in a considerable way to those problems, simple things such as what we eat daily, can contribute to the problem, or maybe how much we waste in comparison to other person from other country.
Undoubtedly all people should have the oportunity to see this film, regardlees their age or ideas, this will help to everyone can understand how this is affecting us."
" Watch and behave
",2020-03-12 00:00:00,10,"This is an eye-opening documentary film. This is a film about Leo's travel for 2 years.
When he traveled all over the world, he faces destroyed the environment and met many experts of environment, politicians. Then he discussed environmental crises with them.I'm so impressed by Gidon Eshel's research which one of the main reasons for methane gas emissions is cows. Every molecule of methane is equivalent to 23 molecules of co2.
In the U.S. 47% of land is used for food production and 70% of that is used to grow feed for cattle. Many things that we eat like fruits, vegies, nuts. They take just a percent.
Most important thing is cows produce methane and methane is a strong greenhouse gas.
So, I decide to cut down on my beef intake. Even if I eat hamburger, I'll eat chicken burger,
I'll make use of tumbler often. I reflect on my lifestyle, I've done nothing even though I was appalled at the environmental crisis. Now It has to change.This film makes me think and reflect on myself. Then it makes me act.
That's why my rate is 10. I'll recommend this to my buddies."
" Before the flood
",2020-03-12 00:00:00,9,"Before the flood is a realistic movie that explains the effects of the climate change and how people could help to stop its negative consequences.
In my opinion i really like this film becouse it isn't the typical film that have a basic plot , this is an interesting and i could learn a lot about the thinghs that i do every day and i can change for save the world for example : stop eating beef, use lees carbon and start to use renovable energies.i recommend this film to everyone specially to the people that not belives in the climate change becouse when they finish to see the film probably they will change their opinion, so in before the flood is showed the effects of our pollution, our mess and our selfishness becouse in thousand of years we have been uncapable to listen the earth."
" It's still a huge problem until now
",2020-03-12 00:00:00,9,"It's talking about the main actor, Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio, traveled to a lot of countries to know what is the influence of climate change. And he also had a lot of talking with politicians and knew what will they do to against climate change.When they were talking about how much gas will be exhausted if we eat beef is the most impressive plot for me, because that is my favorite food.The score of movie I give is 9, because it's still a big problem for us. If we don't want to deal with this situation, the environment will be destroyed in one days."
" This film makes me worried about nature in the future
",2020-03-11 00:00:00,9,"Firstly I wanna say this even if it's not related to this film.
I've never thought Ban Ki-moon who was the UN secretary general appears in this film. I'm so proud of him.
I was surprised that almost 30% india people don't have access to electricity.
So, they've been using cow crap for cooking instead of electricity.
It's so sad.
Lastly the reason why I gave 9 rating is that this film makes me consider Climate Change strongly.
actually I'm not interested in kind of this genre.
but after watching this film, my thought was changed.
It's not my business but this is our business including me.
we should think about Climate Change again and again.
It would be coming soon to us"
" Wtf !!!! So scared !!!
",2020-03-11 00:00:00,10,The documentary follows actor and activist Leonardo DiCaprio as he travels to five continents to gain a deeper understanding of climate change and its impact on the world. Sunita Narain is a Delhi-based environmentalist and author. She let me knew there are 30% of households in India don't have access to electricity. Can you imagine that electricity consumed by one American at home is equivalent to 34 citizens of India? I appreciate I had the chance to watched this documentary let me realized that climate change is an important issue we have to face and solve it. So I gave it 10 stars !!!!!!!!
" EYE-OPENING DOCUMENTARY.
",2020-02-22 00:00:00,9,"A heartfelt, decent, educational documentary about the most important issue of our time: Global Warming. Everybody should watch this documentary to see where this planet is headed. It displays how bad this issue has become, but also ways we can come together to make a change. DiCaprio did an amazing job showing this important, ongoing situation. Well done."
" Scrap Global Warming, now it is Climate Change
",2020-02-14 00:00:00,1,"Ever notice how the liberal media is running from the term ""global warming"" like its the ebola virus. The evidence for global warming is collapsing. So they switch to climate change. Of course the climate is changing, it is in a constant state of flux. This way, if it gets cooler, BAM, climate change. If it get hotter, BAM, climate change. And then to hear this from Leonardo Dicaprio. A man that flies in a private jet and spews more carbon than a small city. People, think... Question everything."
" Very informative
",2020-02-05 00:00:00,9,This was an amazing watch! Really put everything into perspective and touched on alot of important information about climate change. Would recommend.
" I actually liked everything about this documentary
",2020-01-29 00:00:00,10,"We've come to the point in our culture where you're expected to have a degree just to join a discussion, and people call that progress. If you don't like what someone has to say, you don't have to make him shut up or make people laugh at him or call him names. You can much more easily tune him out and go on with your life.So Leo is like the average viewer, which makes him easy to identify with. Some of us may be more ignorant than he is on the issue and some may be more well read and researched. I can tell you based on my experiences (I spent the first 26 years of my life on an island that has been affected by the rising sea level) that this documentary was right on the money. It was also very stressful for me to watch, but I had to. I owed it to my home.I don't care that Leo isn't a scientist. I don't care that no expert or leader shown was enough for certain people. I don't care that the documentary didn't give us a to-do list to ensure optimal results for our world to survive and even bounce back. If any of these things bothered you, I'm not even sure why you watched this film.I will be doing research to figure out ways I can reduce my own impact on this world that I love. I hope that one day all of America will do the same, politicians included.If you work in the oil industry, get out while you can. My husband worked in it too and it's dog eat dog. No one cares about you because they don't have to. Almost every single one of the companies (I'm not just talking about the ones fracking either) will short you hours, stiff you on your last check, and some will even lie and say you never worked for them and will get away with it if you don't hang on to check stubs, making it impossible for the wage and labor board to help you get what's yours. So should I be worried about displaced workers if the oil industry tanks? Do yourself a favor and get out whether or not you think it will. It's practically criminal anyway. What's more important? Making big bucks for a few years until they replace you or your integrity?So while there are things the documentary could have gone into and information we could have been spoonfed, in the limited time it had, I believe it made the absolute best use of it. The message I got from it is America is holding the world back from making the greatest move we need to save it, and what you and I do in our homes isn't going to cut it at this point. We need big change. We need a major shift to renewable energy that is only possible at the level of government. Sure, we can all start installing solar panels and even mini wind turbines, but how many can afford that? It's kind of like the way food has gone. You know a home cooked meal with all organic, fresh food is the healthiest option, but is it affordable or is that package of mac n cheese more cost effective? We all have to survive too, otherwise, what are we saving the world for?The only ones who can help us ALL shift to renewable energy is the government. What I find incredible is that so many industrialized countries, China included, are moving in that direction and America still isn't. What's stopping us at this point? Pride? Or is it just the lobbyists? And why do we still allow lobbyists? Maybe we need more transparency and consequences in politics. How do these people represent us when they're taking money on the side to do the opposite of what's beneficial for us?And for those who were put off by the ways that fossil fuels were used to make this documentary, are you aware of any other ways that this could have been done with the same result? Should we ask Leo to build his own boat by his own hands (not manufactured on a production line) and sail from country to country with his bicycle that he rides from place to place while filming with a camera strapped to his forehead? Would you be satisfied then? In a world that depends on fossil fuels and doesn't already provide alternatives at every corner, I think you're asking for too much. Get off the soap box."
" As big a Hypocrite as Al Gore?
",2019-11-25 00:00:00,1,"A Documentary about a Hollywood elitist who has a carbon footprint AT LEST 20 times larger than the average American and his struggle to stop ALL OF US from destroying the world.
Great for those weak of mind types that cant wait to give more of their hard earned money to the government and the worlds richest 1% to fruitlessly attempt to stop the planets climate from doing what its been doing for the last 4 billion years....change."
" An impressive and powerful movie that is life changing
",2019-11-20 00:00:00,10,"This is one of the best documentaries I have watched. It taught me a lot of things about climate change, how we can help to make a change, how human action is the reason why the earth is deteriorating, all the consequences that climate change will and has brought and how people deal with it.""Before the Flood"" made me realize how important and urgent it is to wake up and start doing something good for our planet before is too late.One of the most thought-provoking People in the documentary was Obama. He said something that really made me reflect on my actions. ""We have to take action now"" he said because If we don't take action now we won't be able to change the damages back to how it was before and to solve this problem in time.In my opinion, I really loved and enjoyed watching this documentary due to its informative and impactful goal. In addition, It is interesting because its plot is about one of the most important issue nowadays. It was definitely a success."
" Save our planet
",2019-11-18 00:00:00,10,"The movie is a great example of making us conscious of the biggest problems that the planet has. It starts with a little introduction of what's happening around the world and the person who shows us the problems is the actor Leonardo Di Caprio.First, the way that the movie projects the sense of urgency is really impressive because we can see a lot of places around the world affected and how the people who live there can survive, for example the people from China have to put on masks because of the pollution or the people from India who live in very serious poor situation and some of them were interviewed and said their worries.Di Caprio speaks with very important people like the Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon, The ex-President of the United States Barack Obama and Pope Francis. In general, they are really worried about the consequences and they hope to make a change to prevent and save the planet.My rating is 10 because in all of the aspects of the movie we can see if we don't do something, a terrible disaster will be happen."
" Kick in the gut. Informative, riveting wake up call to understand the immediate dangers of global warming.
",2019-11-17 00:00:00,9,"Leave it up to Leonardo di Caprio to make a riveting movie. He succeeded where many other movie makers have failed to explain the immediate dangers of global warming. Leonardo di Caprio does explain the dangers of global warming in a riveting way that is easily understandable for everybody. What's great about Leonardo di Caprio's star status is the fact that he gets invited by ALL the world's leaders. We get to hear those politicians and leaders speak beautifully about all the goals they want(ed) to achieve. BUT they are failing at implementing those goals for over 20 years now!The biggest positive thing I learned from this movie was the fact that politicians are always eager to please the masses that vote for them. Once the masses' opinion about global warming changes, politicians will follow. Not the other way around, although everyone is expecting governments or scientists to solve the problem of global warming.The solutions for solving global warming are already known for decades. It only takes large mass scale protests by you and I and every other civilian on this earth to start implementing those solutions right now..."
" You can not miss this amazing documentary
",2019-11-15 00:00:00,9,"This is a documentary created by Leonardo DiCaprio. It starts with a painting called ""The Garden of Earthly Delights"", which consists of 3 parts: The first one is about Adam and Eve. In the garden of Eden with many animals like birds, elephants, giraffes, etc. The second is about mortal sins, overpopulation and excesses, and the last one is about a wicked world, with a degraded and destroyed landscape.
This documentary is about Earth´s climate change. This movie follows Leonardo DiCaprio all over the world visiting places like Beijing, which is choked by industrial pollution, Canada, where ancient boreal forest have been cut, Indonesia, where rainforest have been incinerated, India, where he met farmers whose crops have been literally washed away, America, where the sea level has been increased, the flooding streets in Miami, and, also, Greenland and Artic, where, he shows that the ancient glaciers are disappearing.
This movie offers information that is alarming, but, at the same time, hopeful. Because it opens your eyes and give you some advice as how you can contribute to help the environment and provide a better future to the next generations; like carnivores should eat less beef and more chicken or stop buying products that use palm oil, and it mentions about the consequences of our behavior for some centuries.
I consider that in this documentary the most thought-provoking person was Pope Francis because it´s really shocking that the leader of the religion agrees with the science after so many centuries of differences between them, and the fact that he is also worried and sure that the climate change is real. It's something that really makes you think about it.
So, I´ll give 9 stars score to this documentary because, for me, that I don't like the documentaries was really interesting, entertaining, and impressive. The images that he shows, the people he interviewed, and their informative resources were incredible. The only thing that I would add would be more short-term advice because I think that we could do more for the environment."
" The Garden of Earthly Delights
",2019-11-15 00:00:00,10,"This thoughtful documentary, begins with a deep review about the masterpiece painted by the Early netherlandish master Hieronymus Bosch, who has portrait an exceptional point of view about the humanity since the heaven where the first humans lived until the hell, reached because of our sins, specially the ""lack of care with our planet"".The narrator (Leo DiCaprio) takes us on all places affected by the climate change and show us how can our planet is nowadays because of the human impact on earth, creating a sense of urgency because the issue is getting bigger every day and we are close to the point of ""no return"".Personally, the most thought-provoking person for me was Pope Francis when he made a speech about the climate change, but the point is not there, what makes me more impact is the fact that the most important person of one of the most following religions in the world talked about this fact and how important is the change that we have to take because there is not going to be any ""miracle"" saving us if we still doing damage to our planet like now.My overall rating of the movie is 10 stars, because of the great production of the movie but specially the message that Leo had transmitted.by Seb."
" Time to do something
",2019-11-13 00:00:00,10,"Before the flood its an incredible documentary that invite us to open our eyes of this real issue that its happening today and now, climate change. Leonardo DiCaprio travel around the world showing evidence of this problem that will end with us if we don't face it now. He traveled to China, India, Greenland, Indonesia... showing different aspects of this issue (factories, ice melting, fires...)
Climate change its affecting our life or will do it if we don't act now, the air its polluted, ecosystems are disappearing, glaciers are melting, and yet there are people who don't believe in climate change, and there is only one word for that...blindness.
Also, in all his trip he was speaking with different people. One of the most thought-provoking in my opinion was Barack Obama. He talk about possibles solutions that maybe didn't reverse the problem that at these point its inevitable, but it could stop it before it comes catastrophic. In my opinion, this documentary deliver more than just information, deliver hope that we are on time to save our planet and to have a future. it really open my eyes and it made me realize that i could do more in my life, that's why i gave it the 10 stars that really deserved it. It's time to do something"
" Are you sure to know about serious environment issues?
",2019-11-13 00:00:00,10,"This is a great documentary that Leonardo DiCaprio travels around the world, talk s with so many people who are related to environment problems of their countries, and considers what we must do to save the world.In the last scene, speech in the UN by DiCaprio who know about a lot of serious crisis all over the world was amazing and overwhelming. I strongly felt his speech was to not only people in the UN, but also me. I was disappointed myself that I did not know many facts and I did not take any action to solve many problems.The most impressive scene in this film was when DiCaprio goes to India. He hears a sorrowful appeal by an Indian woman. She says electricity consumed by one American at home is equivalent to 24 citizens of India. American people should sell so many electricity but on the contrary they waste so much electricity. I felt that I have a lot of responsibility when I use electricity.I did not know a lot of facts in this film and I was always surprised or disappointed by them. Many people teach me about environment problem around the world, but are you sure to say like ""I understand what happens in the world"" or ""I make an effort to save this planet""? I do not think so. Don't you pretend to understand everything? Are you sure to take an action? I want you to feel crisis to watch this film.This film let me know how dangerous the earth is, and how little we know and take an action about the environment problem. This film deserves to be a bible for the future. That is why I gave this rating to the film."
" It is time to face what real is.
",2019-11-13 00:00:00,9,"This kind of movies are not really funny, in my case I needed to watch that, but it was so good movie to know about real environment. It is not easy to know about environment of the world. No one can know that exactly, people just focus on their life and their near environment, so even if that is getting worse, it is hard to know directly.This documentary gives us a lot of information. In the beginning of the part they said fossil fuels. Nowadays Fossil fuels are really important for our economy, such as coal, oil and natural gas, but the problem is, it is not good for our environment.Main topic was global warming. They said climate has been changed so fast. It has caused many nature disasters, melting ice. If it is going on, some cities like Florida will be under the sea. That's not over. It can cause diverse social problems that no one can expect.I was little shocked during watching this. Our nature is in danger and trouble now. That is getting worse and speed is so fast. especially when I saw India and china, I thought it is a serious problem. Leonardo Dicaprio went many countries, I could see many problems in there.I gave 9 for this movie. It has various grounds to prove and explain global warming, they went there and everything was real. There were many experts about environment, it is helpful to believe. I'm an optimistic person, so usually I don't like to think about this or I just believe it will be okay, but now we are really in a danger, there were many reasons why scientists said it is a big deal. I felt little bad and it made me remind myself. I already sunk in this problem. From today I will do something for environment, even if that is not a big deal."
" Should we worry about climate change?
",2019-11-13 00:00:00,10,"This movie show us the real perspective of what is happening to the earth, how much damage we are making and how terrible it is for the humanity.
We can not ignore the fact that in a few years will be been in a historical catastrophe created by us.It is unacceptable that politicians are bribed on such an important issue.
Albert Einstein, one of the most intelligent men in our whole history said that the thirst war will be caused due to water shortage as a prediction as a real fact if we continue doing our routine in the same way, in other words killing the Planet.Piers Sellers from NASA created a model simulation of the earth which show us the enormous tragedy that we will make our future generations live. We must generate awareness in the worldwide to avoid what come to us.
If all of us make small changes we will make a big change.DON'T IGNORE THE IGNORABLE...Andres Moreno Mariani"
" Great and entertaining documentary
",2019-11-13 00:00:00,10,"This documentary shows us the reality of the world in where we are living in nowadays. From its beginning, Leonardo Di Caprio shows the most honest part of himself taking us with him to the parts of the world that are more affected by the huge problem, the Global Warming. In each place, climate change pundits explain how human life is affecting and damaging the nature and what should we do to stop all the harm we are causing to it.As is this documentary informs us in a entertaining way of probably one of the biggest issues we have nowadays, we all should to devote ourselves to watch this 96 minute video that will probably change the way we interact with our planet and that will help us to realize of how considerable this concern is.
'Before the Flood' made me understand the situation in which we are living in and how serious the circumstances of the Earth are.
The citizens from China, India, Greenland, between many other countries and places in the world, are suffering in the first person the climate change that we are provoking, and us, as citizens of the planet Earth, must do something to change it.
Watching this documentary will help you to take the step that you need to include all those small habits that can contribute to have a better world and can stop the damage we are all causing to the environment.I rate this title with 10 stars, because I think its a very interesting documentary that shows us everything we need to know about Global Warming and, as I already said, helps us to realize of the devastation humans are making to the planet in a more entertaining way than conventional documentaries do."
" We have to stop. We are killing our house.
",2019-11-13 00:00:00,9,"Before the Flood is a documentary that shows the big problem that we have with our planet. Leonardo DiCaprio, who is an actor and United Nations Messenger of Peace, explores the impact of climate change on the planet. Dialogue with world leaders, scientists and activists.During the film, Leonardo goes to different places like Canada, Arctic, Miami, Beijing, New Delhi... When he arrives to these places, he is stunned to see how much humans are polluting the planet. He sees the increase of the water level and how much the Chinese factories are polluting our planet.Now, after watching this film, in 2019, I'm more worried about climate change because the films was released in 2016 and nowadays I think that climate change is increasing because many governments do not their job and don't apply all practices that they can do to improve the pollution.My rating of this documentary film is 9 because I think that the film does what a documentary is suppose to do. The film explains the facts and informs about the climate change to finish with different ways to stop contaminating."
" ""time to change""
",2019-11-13 00:00:00,9,"This movie shows how important it is to change our lifestyle. It's our fault that all this happens. There are more earthquakes, heat waves and many other problems like the increasing sea level.During this movie, you realize that we don't have much time anymore. We have to change now! As an example, it shows us how many resources it takes to produce beef and that we have other possibilities like chicken or become a vegetarian. Everyone has to change his own habits.But the most important part of the solution is to change laws and technologies to emit less carbon dioxide. If we can improve technologies and force countries like China, USA and India to change their mind, we will move forward to a better future.I think that this movie shows every kind of problem we have at the moment. Still in 2019 we don't have the right solutions to solve the biggest problem of this century."
" Shocking
",2019-11-13 00:00:00,9,"Documentaries generally do not have recognized actors, but this is an exception.
When I saw that Leonardo DiCaprio was going to ""star in"" this project I imagined that it would be completely related to him.
After seeing Before the Flood, I realized that I was wrong.
This documentary talks about global warming and highlights the catastrophic consequences it has and will have in the not too distant future.
It presents the situations of several countries such as China and India. It has statistics, opinions, interviews, etc. It shows the physical deterioration of the planet. It contrast corruption and the influence of money on social leaders. And the whole story begins and ends with the masterpiece ""Garden of Delights"" painted by Jerome Bosch.
In my opinion, the talk with Sunita Narain in India was the most though-provoking. She talks about the terrible conditions in which the population of her country live. And she backs with numbers that the United States is a country addicted to fossil fuels by adding that 1 American consumes the same amount of electricity at home than 34 citizens of India.
I rate this film with 9/10 stars because it manages to take the reality of the environment , put it on screen and create awareness about everything that is happening and could happen if we do not act."
" A powerful message
",2019-11-13 00:00:00,10,"This Leonardo Di Caprio documentary shows us how bad the global warming problem is. During all the film, we can see the incredible big problems that we already have on our planet; the melting glaciers, poverty, industrial pollution, large number of animals that are dying, etc. The best is that he shows us this by taking us to the places which are directly affected by climate change.With this documentary, we can fully understand and appreciate that climate change is a fact and it is our job to do something to remedy it.
The most thought-provoking person in this documentary is Sunita Narain, who is an Indian activist. She explains India's role in climate change, points out the hypocrisy of the western countries (and how it is affecting the entire world) and gives us a powerful message ""We need countries to believe that climate change is real"".This documentary is wonderful. This really makes you think and start to become aware. For me, this film deserves all the stars above all because the content is incredible no matter that the protagonist be Di Caprio."
" A big influence to change the world
",2019-11-13 00:00:00,10,"Climate change has been a huge problem that has everyone discussing it's importance and how we can stop it from destroying the earth. In this movie we see graphical content of the damage that we as humans are provoking and tries to rise awareness on the topic. From talking about how fuels affect ecosystems to what can we do as individuals to help the planet, Leonardo Di Caprio traveled all over the world to do some research and spread a very important message.
In my opinion, we can't deny the urgency of climate change and global warming. It has been a thing for decades now and we cannot wait for a magical solution. The problem is that no everyone cares about it, or they think they are not responsible for it. We need the whole world to be aware of the actual situation so everyone can contribute as soon as possible. We don't have time, there are already irreversible consequences affecting millions of lives and ecosystems and if we continue like this, there's no hope for the human race in the future.
The most thought-provoking person I saw in this movie was the Pope Francis. A religious authority talking from scientific point to solve a problem means a lot. It makes me think of how serious this problem is and how soon we have to act to make a change.
This film deserves the 10 stars. The fact that Leonardo Di Caprio took part on doing this and use his influence to reach the general audience it's overwhelming. The production, the music, the message, the purpose and the people involved makes this a masterpiece that could move thousands to make a real change."

",2019-08-31 00:00:00,10,"Not climate change, it is climate crisis. Nothing new but the movie put emphasis on the fact that the actions must be radical. Marginal actions are just not enough."
" movie with interesting facts
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,8,"The movie itself is well made. Leonardo DiCaprio is interested in global warming so he met lots of global leaders and scientists. In the movie, he travels around the world and shows damaged cities and nature.The most interesting part is if we can not stop global warming, the temperature of Earth will increase and it will make Greenland's ice melt. If the ice melts, Greenland itself will become the heater, which used to be the cooler.I never thought that religious believers such as priests wouldn't take care of global warming and focus more on the bible or religious activities. However, in the movie I can see Pope Francis, the head of the Catholic Church and sovereign of the Vatican City State, giving a speech about global warming. The fact that the head of the religion also takes care of global warming made me think global warming is a real threat.I will give the movie 8 stars. The movie has lots of good information, however to me, movies should make adrenaline secreted."
" An amazing documentary to change our minds
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,9,"This documentary is brilliant and really interesting because it shows the reality of our future. If you want to know more about the climate change and its consequences, you have to watch it.The documentary shows the places that are the most affected by the effects of climate change. We can see Di Caprio's trip, in Greenland for example, which will probably disappear if the climate stays at this temperature. We can really see the problems and realize how serious they are.I was so impressed by the videos of the global warming's consequences. Fires, storms, all the things we are doing to the planet. I was so impressed by the ignorance and denial of the politicians. I didn't know there were people like this.
I also didn't know that Leonardo Di Caprio was that much involved in this cause.Barack Obama was the most thought-provoking person to me, maybe because I admire him and I listened to his speech with a lot of attention. He was talking about the concerns that he has about the future if we don't take action. He was saying that there will be a competition between the populations because the people who were living in the ocean will move. I realized that the climate change will really change our lives when the Dr. Piels Sellers from NASA showed that Europe will get hot.My rating is 9 because I really liked this documentary, and I learnt a lot of things that I didn't know. I loved the colors and the music, there was a particular atmosphere that I enjoyed and that made me listening all. This documentary have a message: ""We are all able to do something, it's up to all of us""."
" Good documentary
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,8,"Di Caprio did a great job by travelling to many country to discuss the dangers of climate change and find possible solutions.People don't understand what is happening in the world right now .So, what Di Caprio did made millions of people realize how serious it's on earth this moment. I recommend this movie to everyone because it shows how dangerous it is on plant earth and how we can make a change. In my opinion, the most thought provoking people in the movie were the Republicans who value their wealth over the world dilemma. The documentary is excellent even though it reminded me of how bad my lifestyle is. The only thing that made me give it 8 out of 10 is because it was little bit long. I think one hour is enough.Highly recommended !"
" what can we do for change the earth
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,10,"This is film about that Leonardo DiCaprio' s trip for 2 years. He traveled the world and faced destroyed the environment. He met experts of environment and politicians and discusses environment with them.
This documentary was so impressive. It shows the serious problem on our earth and tries to suggest solutions to us. Also, climate change has become worse.
The message of this film was thoughtful and made me reflect on it. There are a lot of shocking scenes. For example, Greenland is melting now. I knew that was melting but didn't realize what happened exactly. It is a disaster because it is melting faster.
I rated this 10 out of 10 because its message was strong and expresses perfect what they want to say. Lastly, reasons that we suppose to protect the earth were obvious."
" What about global warming?
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,9,"In this documentary you will find a lot of information about climate change and global warming. Leonardo Di Caprio has an important message to transmit because many people don't know what climate change is about and what the impacts are on earth, that's why people should watch this.While watching this, I really realized that global warming was a serious problem and that we should take it very seriously. Furthermore, I was surprised to see how Leonardo Di Caprio was involved in this cause and it kind of comfort me to see that there are people who are ready to be part of the solution. Finally, I found that the documentary in itself was very beautiful and I really enjoyed watching it.As far as I'm concerned, the most thought provoking person was Dr. Piers Sellers from NASA. First of all, with his simulation model of the earth, he could show us what was gonna happen in the coming years if we don't change or habits. Secondly, NASA is, in my opinion, a very reliable as a source, that's why I was convinced by what he said. Finally, I really liked the part where he said that there was a way to stop global warming.My rating for this documentary is 9. I enjoyed watching it. I liked the way Leonardo Di Caprio was involved and how he tries to convince people to be part of the solution. Another reason why I liked it, is because there was a lot of visual information and many beautiful images. Finally, the best part about this movie is probably the message behind it."
" a good movie
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,9,"The movie shows a lot of the actual reality of the world that its a reality in our today society.
in my personal opinion, i think everybody should watch this movie because it shows in a very good way how climate change affects the world.
DI Caprio does a really good job. He interviews important people such as the pope and Ban Ki Moon, who are really influential people in the whole world. So when they talk about it, it may cause a different impression for some people.
Also, when Di Caprio talks with Obama and he says that climate change is a national security problem because it affects everyone and every country around the world it's affected.
Also, this movie can change someones point of view because it shows real information in an uncensored way.
i give a 9 for the way of presenting the information in the movie in a clear and understandable way."
" a very thought-provoking movie which led me think about the world's biggest issue more than ever
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,10,"This movie was about all the serious issues happening due to global warming so as not to bring about a huge mess in the near future. It has rather inspired me as a one human being. It led me to consider the issue that the earth is facing right now more than ever before, and has absolutely motivated me to help the environment. Despite that, it also made me feel sad by knowing that there are a few politicians from the Republicans who constantly deny the impact of climate change in order to receive money. It is still hard to believe that there are people who put their wealth above their nations' problems.
I rated this movie 10/10. There were not any scenes which seemed boring or unhelpful. Every aspect was full of thought-provoking contents and the way Dicaprio tried to describe the gravity of this whole matter was very enthusiastic and telling which led the listeners to sympathize with it, and deeply comprehend it. I was also impressed that this movie directly mentioned some appropriate means to revitalize this situation such as switching from beef to chicken which could be easily done on a daily basis."
" Informative and thought-provoking movie about climate change
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,10,"Before the Flood, an informative movie, shows to the world the realities of climate change, it shows to everyone how big the problem is !
Leonardo DiCaprio has been traveling during 2 years around the world to catch the information from many people and make a statement of the current situation of our planet.During the movie, he shows to us the current state of our planet with terrifying images of some essential places on Earth !For me, the different scenes are absolutely thought-provoking. They make me think about how can we save the planet. I think every country's government should work together to find a solution. I don't have a solution for this problem, so this movie puzzles me about the future of Earth's population.DiCaprio is clearly the most thought-provoking person of this movie in my case, he informs everyone about global warming to protect our planet and I admire his determination.I put 10 out 10 ! This movie can change your vision of global warning and inform you about the current state of our planet. Moreover, it makes you think about solutions."
" Our planet IS in danger
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,10,"In this documentary, Leonardo DiCaprio talks about the most important issue in our world which is how we've damaged and still are damaging our planet as well as explaining how industries, countries, governments and individuals are having a huge impact. He does this while visiting some of the places which are being affected. Moreover, he gives us alternatives on how to improve the environment's situation or at least try to reduce our footprint.As for me, the most impressive part of the film is definitely the ending. the words said and the images shown make the perfect combination making you not only feel goosebumps but also guilt over the way we consume and harm our home.Although DiCaprio talks to lots of important people through the documentary, Dr. Piers Sellers is the most thought-provoking one i recognize. He seems like someone who is really informed on the severity of the subject; however, he is really optimistic that the situation is going to get better.My score for this production is without doubt 10 simply because the situation we have regarding our planet is extremely worrisome and we need these kinds of films to spread the most information possible and show everyone our reality."
" Inspiring !
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,8,"This movie tackles the greatest issue of our time, climate change. Leonardo Di Caprio gives a large perspective of the environmental disaster that humanity is facing. Forget everything you thought you knew about the world famous actor, Di Caprio is just here to open your mind. Time to change our way of doing !The most thought-provoking moment appears when Di Caprio met an Indian environmental activist. She just gives an overview of the facts behind political words. Thus, he insists on the power that citizens really have. Our daily way of consuming is essential when it comes to climate change. This movie explains with easy-to-understand examples how consuming some products may directly lead to the burning of rain-forest, animal extinction...I put an eight of out 10 because of the deep-reflection that triggers this movie. it is not just about being afraid of this issue, it provides lot of concretes measures that everyone can do on a daily basis. Let's understand the way we can deal with climate change, and act for a better future."
" You have to watch this movie now!
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,10,"This film talks about climate change and how much we are in danger. There will be more natural disaster than now if we don't take action to protect our planet right now. When we watch this movie, we can confront real situations that are happening in the world. They said we have to take action to protect our Earth right away and consume differently about what we buy, eat, etc.. Whether we live on Earth safely or not is totally up to all of us.I haven't actually thought too much about this topic. Maybe, it is right to just escape these situations because I thought I couldn't handle it. However, after I watched this movie, I realized I was also able to figure out some problem by myself. For example, if I really want to protect Earth, I can try to use natural material when it comes to detergent. Cow has a lot of methane and methane has a lot of carbon. It is not good for our Earth. So, if you want to eat meat, you can change to chicken.Even though DiCaprio is not a expert on global warming or climate change, I was shocked because he was informative about global warming to protect Earth. I was really impressed by him.I put 10 out 10. I think, when it comes to global warming, there is no excuse about protecting nature and people who want to protect Earth are now doing something to reason with people who don't care about climate change. So, I just want to put 10 because I think all people should watch this movie and see what is happening on Earth now. This movie is a fabulous one that must be seen!"
" There are a lot reasonable strong messages.
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,9,What this movie impressed on me is there is a risk that the climate change will jeopardize not only nature but also things like national security.the most thought-provoking person is Barack Obama. The reason why I think is that he concerns about not only short-term responsibility also long-term responsibility to keep peace around the world even he should try to improve many issues that are going on right now.This movie has strong reasonable messages that make all of us a world citizen.I recommend you to watch and try to think about what you can do right now on your place and accurate latest information about climate change.
" We should consider our environment and preserve our earth
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,10,"This is a perfect documentary film about our nature. This movie shows us Leonardo Di Caprio going to a lot of nations which have suffered from serious environmental problems like floods, deforestation and drought.For me, the most impressive scenes are some politicians denying the negative aspects of pollution and rejecting to consider our nature. I'm so surprised that they just neglected our future results from destroying nature because they were paid money by some companies which dealt with fossil fuels.I think president Obama is the most provoking person to me. In this movie, Obama has concerns about the future if we don't take action. He considers not only the United States but also other countries. He says that these environmental problems will bring about national security issues all over the world.This movie is incredible! I give 10 out of 10 willingly. Thanks to this movie, I want to save our planet and try to fix my bad habits which have affected our earth. We should take responsibilities for our history and try to make a ecological world."
" It is time to take action for our planet.
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,10,"Before the Flood is a movie in which Leonardo Di Caprio travels around the world and shows us how it is being affected by climate change, reinforcing the fact that we, the human beings, are responsible for it.
Through out, his journey he also meets experts and important people who are also concerned about this issue.
This truly impacted me and left me thinking about how we are destroying our planet and how we are running out of time.However, it also inspired me to take action from the place I am. In this case I should start consuming differently and voting for leaders who will fight for climate change.
I think the most thought provoking person whom he talks with is Dr. Piers Sellers from NASA. He created a model simulation of the earth that shows all the changes our planet has suffered among these years and how each area is being affected in different ways.
I would give this movie a 10 because it is a way of showing many people reality and inform them about global warning.
Besides, I like the fact that above all the information and facts he gives, the movie is also moving. It makes you feel fear and guilt, but it is also asking you for help. It impacts you in such a way it inspires you to take action about this big issue that is not only affecting us now, but also the future generations."
" Before the Flood - Short Review
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,9,"Before the Flood is a movie about Leonardo DiCaprio's journey all over the world. He visits some places that have been affected by climate change. It is a film that briefly shows the causes and future consequences of this worldwide issue and how human behavior has contributed to it.I like this film because of many reasons. First of all, I think it was really informative, there were a lot of things I did not knew about. Also, even though it is a film charged with a lot of information, they managed to make an interesting result. Additionally, I think the movie definitely makes you reflect on your daily actions and make sure that you receive the main idea.I really recommend this film because it is necessary to be conscious about what is happening in the world right now. This is our home, this is our only planet and the solution is in our hands. I rated it 9 out of 10 because I think they could have shown each problem a little bit more thoroughly in order for the audience to understand more about the specific issues."
" Our Planet Is Changing
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,10,"This film shows us how we are affecting the direction of our planet.The movie starts with Leonardo Di Caprio explaining to us his experience since he was a child that had in his room a print about the evolution of the world: ""The Garden of Earthly Delights"". He goes through the time that hadn't have knowledge of the climate change until he is the United Nations Ambassador and could feel and see the truth face of the world where we are living nowadays.It seems that we are creating a horrible world for our children and they will not be able, in most of the situations, to achieve a solution for this big problems.We also have a good point of hope of the most thought-provoking person for me
in the movie that is Elon Musk.The owner of TESLA give us a little of hope with his idea of create Gigafactories that can also supply a very large amount of energy and according to him, if we had 100 of these we could give energy to the entire planet.For me, the grade should not drop below 10, because as much as you may not agree on some points, this film makes you come to a conclusion to better understand the real situation of the planet."
" Completely appaling
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,7,"The movie features the issues that are happening in and with our world; we can see how global warning is affecting the whole environment and everybody's health.Global Warning is portrayaled as a huge problem that needs an urgent solution to prevent massive consequences such as deforestation, heat waves, corals collapsing, bigger storms and inestable temperatures, among others.
What really got my attention was how what we do in one single country leads us to a huge catastrophe in the opposite part of the world; and what is very worrying is that some people, and very important people, like politicians and political pundits are denying a situation that is right in front or their own eyes, clearly because of personal interest. What is also amazing about this documentary, is the way they try to convince you that this is really happening, showing you different parts of the world that are being affected.
One of the most provoking people in this movie for me is one Indian woman that really showed Leo DiCaprio how the things that we do in one single part of the world can affect another part that we don't even have an idea, and how different the lifestyle could be depending on how bad global warning is affecting that country; this woman was so down about how industrialized countries like the United States are not doing anything to try to stop this huge problem.
In this movie we can see other personalities explaining how the situation is affecting the world we are living in, such as Pope Francis, the CEO of Tesla, former president Barack Obama, the former Secretary General of the UN, and some scientists; these are considered the ones who care about Global Warning and climate change.
On the other hand we have some people who don't believe in this issue like Donald Trump, or the Florida Governor, and some senators of the US that think that this is an invention made to catch the public attention.
I was mesmerized when i saw this documentary because of the immensity and beauty of our own world, and I realized how this place we are living on is going own because of our own actions.
This is a is a 7 star movie because it is a pretty good documentary that tries to get your attention and makes you realize of a situation that is really affecting all of us but it's a pretty long one that maybe bores you and makes you sleepy."
" Great documentary about the climate change & global warming
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,9,"The documentary is about the terrible reality which is going on today due to the rapid climate change. Leonardo Di Caprio traveled all over the world in order to see which issues and consequences global warming causes. In addition, many people and politicians do not care or do not give enough attention in order to change something in our industrial world.In my opinion, this documentary is a great insight into climate change and global warming. Even though, I have already dealt with this topic I learnt many things, which shocked me. Furthermore, I really could not believe that so many politicians do not care about our earth and act as if they do not have any idea what will happen in the future if we do not take action.The person who was for me the most thought-provoking is Leonardo Di Caprio himself. I have not known that he did such a great effort to see and learn about the climate change and get to know the opinions of many different people like Elon Musk. Moreover, he tries a lot in order to take action and motivates people to do something.I give this documentary 9/10 stars due to the major knowledge the film provides and thrilling scenes, which were filmed all over the world. However, there are a few unnecessary information which was not interesting and bored me."
" How to change the world with a single movie
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,10,"This movie expresses the situation of our world through examples of a situation that we need to upgrade. This is explained by lot of highly qualified scientists and the movie is lived by Leonardo DiCaprio.For me this movie was incredible, it wasn't just about global warming, it was about the future of our planet. During all the movie, I was fascinated about what the human race is doing to our poor planet just to make money. Especially when burning the Alberta forest just to extract oil sand.The movie is showing a lot of aspects about global warming. All those aspects are explained by scientists. For me the most provoking and the most interesting person was Elon Musk. He explained how we can change the world just by building one hundred Gigafactory. With only those factories, we will be able to provide energy for all the planet. Tesla can't do it by itself so other companies need to do it.I'm giving a score of ten out of ten because I think that everyone needs to watch this movie so that we can make a real difference in the world. Like I said before, I was shocked by how we are mistreating our planet and with this documentary I want to contribute to save our planet."
" message to our future
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,9,"This film shows us a lot of environmental problems because the world's natural situation is getting worse and worse every year and we should start solving the problems right now. Di Caprio as a viewer travels to different parts of the world to understand the real situation and how we can help the next generation.
Global warming is one of the most important problem nowadays and this movie is a great message to me and, I think, to you because we truly don't know how much time we have before something will happen. My grade for this documentary film is 9 because after watching it I haven't changed my opinion on this world's question and it's not something new for me - it is a good film with well-showed problems, but it is very usual."
" Really amazing and deeply touching
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,10,"The movie is about the really famous actor Leonardo Di Caprio going around the world with the documentary crew and learning the most important and impactful issues related to the climate change of the last years. They discover and learn about deforestation, natural disasters, migration from those more impacted areas. Leonardo becomes more and more conscious during his trip as well we do, and it really impressed me because in my idea of a rich and successful american actor there's no space for sensibility and worries about those arguments, but he really cares and not only in the movie filming contest but also in his private life, since he was a child.
There's a part in which the whole crew travels to India and there they meet a person who talks about the primary resource of energy there, which is the dung (a product of the cow excrement), used to cook as well as warm houses. She says that only 70 percent of the people there have access to the electricity and it really shocked me, and made me think about how wasteful people with resources can be..
My rating for this documentary is absolutely 10 because it's not heavy or depressing to watch at all, they present the data as they are and I think that it's a really good way to make people (first of all young people) conscious and worried about what's going on and about what everybody is NOW called to do."
" Our planet, our home. It is our responsibility to take care of it.
",2019-06-06 00:00:00,10,"It has been one of the most incredible documentaries that I've seen. It is breathtaking because it shows us what is happening in our word and how we are destroying the environment by each action in our life. Day by day we do things without thinking about it because it is normal or common for us. As a result the environment is getting worse. We are wrong thinking that small changes by every single person are not going to change anything. Actually, small changes make big differences.Barack Obama said ''My kids will never see a glacier the way I saw when I went to Alaska. I want to be able my kids and my grandkids see the same things I saw as I was growing up. Even if you are unsentimental about that in very hard-headed terms you've got to worry about the Nation''.And it is really true, I don't want to see my world get destroyed, we should start now, tomorrow could be too late."
" I like it =)
",2019-06-06 00:00:00,10,"This documentary is about how Leonardo Dicaprio travel around the world talking with different people from different country about the climate changes and the effects that will cause in the future and how we can try to find a solution for save the environment. Making people aware so that they think that climate change is not a game and will have serious repercussions in the future.
I put 10 stars because i think the documentary have all the requirements for present the true about the climate change and Leonardo DiCaprio did a good job."
" We have to act now
",2019-06-06 00:00:00,9,"This movie is telling us the urgency of global warming talking with people who are in various fields. One of the most thought-provoking sean was as follows. Scientists have known about the problem of global warming for over half a century and opening this fact to the public is important. However, because of the power of money, the voices of scientists were ignored and even threatened. We have to know about this fact but lobbyists and politicians have power to conceal this. Global warming is comming much faster than we think and we have to act now to show our children the world that we know. Before I watched this movie I thought that global warming is a story of far future. However there are many countries suffering the pollution now and many things can be changed in a decade. This movie is good because it explains the urgency of global warming nowadays. Considering many countries' conditions was very impressive and I liked interviewers' diversity. Even though it seems like a little bit exagerated, still it can be a good motivation to people. Time is not our side. We have to change our behavior."
" Let's re-think about our planet
",2019-06-06 00:00:00,8,"Overall, the atmosphere of this movie was serious. DiCaprio looks around the world were still processing environmental pollution. it was mainly natural resources that we consume excessively. the situation of the earth was much more serious than I thought.
Needless to say, we have to immediately take action and re-know information about our planet. Dr. Piers Seller from NASA said that if we don't take action, we will confront a huge disaster like steep climate rise and melt the iceberg Additionally, he conducts a model simulation of the earth. Surprisingly, the changes between the 1990s and now are obviously big. in the movie, a small change in our day can make a big change. if we acknowledge our situation and try to change, then we can protect our planet. I want to award a high score for this video because of provoking awareness."
" A perfect way to explain what our world is going through.
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,10,"This documentary tell us all the problems that our planet is facing right now. We usually think, that we are far away from this kind of troubles, this long-film is here to say that we are 10 years away for a massive catastrophe, maybe less. This movie shows us that we are in a very complicated situation, and that we need to stand up as fast as we can. Leonardo DiCaprio has traveled for two years all over the word, he visited the countries that are the core of this problem. He talked with important people that have influence in this matter.
The most thought-provoking person in my opinion was Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX has done a lot for the humanity. He wants to take us to Mars in the next years, he's worrie about what's happening with the climate change. And the most important thing he is giving solutions to these problems.
I have to give 10 starts to this movie because I really think that we need this kind of documentaries. We need to open our eyes and see the loom ahead. This movie gives us a clear message, we must act quickly. And if we don't, we are going to regret."
" Very good movie that explain climate changes problems and possible solutions
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,10,"I was really surprised when I saw this documentary in class. I really enjoyed watching it and it was with Leonardo DiCaprio a celebrity that most people know.The documentary is about him travelling for at least two years to learn more about the climatic changes, the different problems and possible solutions. He went to Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Indonesia, China, Greenland and other countries. He also met a lot of important people like scientists, politicians, Barack Obama and Al Gore, Elon Musk he had met several people from all around the world and he gave plenty of speeches during years to inform people about the climatic changes.The urgency is that we should all start doing something important for the planet and the environment before it gets too late. We need to take care of our planet and environment not destroy and pollute everything. I really think this documentary is constructive, it makes us realize a lot of things that's why I gave this documentary a 10 out of 10."
" Feeling after seeing before the flood
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,9,"This movie starts to show while explaining a painting with a narration of DiCaprio. Painting show 3 phases of evaluation. Even if it was made a long time ago, it surprisingly shows our reality. DiCaprio meets UN secretary general Ban Gi Moon. and makes an address to another secretary. After the address, DiCaprio explains a lot of problems with global warming caused by using fossil fuels. He went to India, China, and Greenland and he dabates about the environmental problem with other experts. Before the Flood is shown how many people try to save the earth against global warming. I was impressed by Elon Musk. In the movie Elon Musk says that without a tax on carbon, the world will not switch to sustainable energy. Because fossil fuel energy is so cheap. then some people think that they don't need to use natural source energy to save the earth. Even if Elon Musk can make factories that are using fossil fuel energy. Elon Musk builds a number of Giga factories using solar panel energy.I think that we should try to save the earth against global warming. If we don't, Global warming will be accelerated. Many scientists have known about the problem of global warming for over half a century. However, we barely try to save the earth. If this situation continues, Temperatures will rise further. As a result, the ecosystem will be changed and some animals will become extinct. As you can see in the movie, there was a lot of ice in Greenland. But for now, a lot of ice has gone even for five years. It's a serious problem. It makes rising sea levels because of melting ice. it causes problems in Miami, Netherlands etc. Due to the rising sea level, they might spend a lot of money. This is not a simple problem. This is homework that needs to be solved together.I want you to seriously think about Global warming after seeing the ""Before the Flood""."
" What are we doing? Sorry Hearth!
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,10,"This movie shows the very touching trip that Leonardo Di Caprio carried out around the world in order to examine in depth what ""climate change"" really is. During his trip, Leonardo met many important people such as Pope Francis, President Barack Obama, the Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-Moon and many others with which he spoke about global warming and their point of view. The most important and dangerous facts that happened are shown in this movie.
In my opinion, this movie is very interesting and alarming, it illustrates what the human species has done to the Hearth, how much damage like pollution, ice melts and deforestation we have caused. Before watching this movie maybe people are not as aware as they should be, so I think that everybody should waste some minutes of their time watching this film and get conscious.
I rate this movie 10 stars because with this one you are finally waking up to the truth to which you cannot escape. Everyone is involved and we have to do something to change, starting with the smallest things."
" Great, but doesn't get the message across
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,7,"Before the flood is a movie that's presented as a documentary about the move to prevent global warming, in which here we follow Leonardo DiCaprio and his journey around the world to expose the danger looming towards our planet that is global warming. The movie itself is very light for someone who wants to know about the danger of global warming but don't want an exceedingly scientific explanation regarding this issue, because, it makes you have someone to relate on, that is Leonardo DiCaprio, and also it doesn't just give you perspectives from just scientists, but also from many politicians as well, like: Former-President of United States, Barrack Obama, The Secretary General of the United Nation, Ban Ki-Moon, and many more. But to be frank, for me personally, even though the movie does seem very light to follow and does urges you to act now to stop global warming, but for me it just gives you that feeling of incompletion, because I think, it's better to just focus on 1 topic but finishes through completely, rather than what this movie does that is having so many broad topics at once but doesn't get the message across."
" We have to give the first step!
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,10,"Before the Flood is a documentary about the climate-change seen from different points of view from all over the world. Leonardo DiCaprio is researching this problem but other famous people appear in the documentary giving their opinion like president Obama, Elon Musk, the Pope...In my humble opinion, everything is exaggerated but it's the only way we can see what's happening in front of us, in the same place where we live. It shows us the hard face of our world, but it also shows how we're destroying the planet.I think that the most thought-provoking person in this documentary is the Pope, it's not usual to see someone like him talking to a camera about climate change, I also think he is really an influential man, a large number of people follow him and act as he said.I personally think we are suffering global warming changes already so we can't leave this problem for later. We have to act now.I rated this documentary with a 10 out of 10 because I think it's brilliant to have a well-known actor like Leonardo DiCaprio that everyone knows."
" Before the Flood review
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,9,"The movie talks about the climate problems caused by human action-using energy and to produce our products.
The person who presents us the film is Leonardo DiCaprio that travel all around the world like: Indonesia, China, Brazil, to see by his own eyes, the issues of our society such the global warming and a bunch of other things. All the time you will see people saying their arguments about this theme and a lot of pros and cons about the politics around the World. Leonardo also talks to important personalities like: Obama, Elon Musk and the Pope, who says about their points of view.
All the impacts on the environment that the biggest enterprises in the world do, will change (or is changing right now) the nature, the air quality , a great many different lives , resuming everything that we can imagine.
The intention is to make people aware to all this things and make then think about how we can change our lifestyle, lead up to a better future for us and for the next generations. If we don't change, we will pay the price for it and maybe as soon as we can imagine."
" Great Movie!
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,9,"The movie tells us about global warming and all its consequences that we will suffer in the future if we don't take an instant action on those serious problems. Guiding us around the world, Leonardo DiCaprio takes us to countries such as China and Indonesia where people are suffering from all this consequences related to air pollution coming from their giant factories.Personally, I believe Elon Musk interview was the most thought-provoking based on all the effort he has done to contribute to this big problem. Musk suggest to every giant company to create their factories based on solar panel system which can be really helpful to the environment.This is a must watch movie because everyone needs to be aware of this problem and they need to take urgent action against it, being conscious about the environment and starting to change our way of life, the daily products we use and to try to educate everyone around you, otherwise the problem will be become bigger and bigger every year until there is nothing to do to solve it.
In conclusion, the movie deserves a 9/10 rating because it shows us the reality of the global warming and guides us to every possible thing we can do to avoid this problem to keep going and going throughout the years."
" Fascinating movie
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,10,"This movie is describing about not only our future also past and present for suggesting correct way that we have to go. In addition, we can hear the nations voice of the countries that have many environmental problems so we can recognize real realities. It provokes me to change my mind and actions.According to the film, our planet is changing dramatically since global warming is progressing faster and faster. It leads up to temperature rising, ice melting, air pollution, rising of the sea level. DiCaprio let us know about these appalling situations that we are going to face soon.Above all, the speech DiCaprio made at the last scene of the movie was the most touched scene of this film. He called upon the global leaders to change the environment for protecting our history and children. That was a mind-blowing scene.Before watching this movie, environment was not my business but after this, I can feel that I'm totally changed. The environment was worse than I thought. We should act right now. we should change everything right now.I want to give 10 stars to this movie because it is such a great movie that describes about our planet and makes changing of people. I think that is the original purpose of this movie and I just want to say 'it works!'."
" A really good film because it shows people how important global warming is
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,10,"In this film Leonardo Dicaprio travels around and shows us the harms of global warming.And he talks with different peoples who are trying to inform everyone .He talks with politicians, scientists and citizens about their ideas what can we do to protect our world.When i saw people wearing masks because of the pollution it made me think why we're doing so much damage to the earth. I understood how important global warming really is. I also got an optimistic point of view when i heard that we still can repair our damage to earth.I gave 10 as a rating because i think it really informs people the right way with science and proofs."
" A very interesting and well made movie
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,9,"This is a documentary presented by Leonardo DiCaprio in which he travels and visits different places where you can clearly see that they are being strongly affected by climate change, also, during the movie Leonardo has the opportunity to talk with different leaders and important people to create solutions and see how climate change has affected most of the people, species and environment in each place.
One of the most impressive and thought provoking parts of the movie is when he travels to the arctic and he can appreciate how the glaciers are melting and are affecting the ecosystem in large proportion.
In my personal opinion, i feel very sad and very sorry about those animals and people who are affected because of other peoples actions, it is very hard to see how climate change is affecting every aspect of our life and sometimes people don't believe or don't care about this problem, but after seeing this movie i assure you that you will take conscience and your way of thinking will change."
" It's up all to us
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,10,"This documentary is an open-eyes call to all of the problems that the earth is passing through right now and to the consequences that we will have in the future, if we don't change our attitude and our mentality.As Leonardo DiCaprio compare with the painting, ""The Garden of Earthy Delights"", we have started in the first panel where everything was pure and immaculate (paradise). Now we are in the second panel, which means we have problems like overpopulation, and running throw the third panel which represents a planet destroyed.If you conjugate this description with what is showed on the movie: as the extinction of animals, fossil fuels companies and their interests and payments to politicians and lobbyist, global warming effects, big habits of consume of energy and meat, rain forest to get the palm oil, etc. You may conclude that if we don't change our attitude we will be in the third panel very soon.The documentary is very good because DiCaprio went to the places to show what is really happen,. You can follow him and notice whats is happening right now. Also you can assist to the meetings with different thought provoking people, as Secretary General of United Nation, Obama, Elon Musk; Pope Francis, Dr. Piers Sellers,... who, with a credible and scientific argumentation, contradict with other politicians who just deny the climate changes (a evident fact showed in all of the documentary).This movie is not just a documentary of the negative situations. It also shows what have been done in different countries in order to prevent or avoid the destruction of the planet. So it also shows the steps and the acts of some companies, governments or even singular people which represent changes and active protection to the wealth of the earth.The documentary ends and you feel that you have more reasons to change as quickly as you can. It makes you reflect about what we, as human beings, are doing to our-self, to others, to now and to the future. How fragile is our planet, and how little things we can do right now to stop this catastrophe!It´s all up to us!"
" A must see movie, a real issue, our planet deserves it
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,10,"Leonardo Di Caprio experiences firsthand the different consequences of climate change traveling during two years to different locations directly affected by global warming.
It's not just ""another"" movie, it's a touching documentary about the real impact of that issue over the world, contrasted with political pundits, some leaders, scientist, activists, among others, from different countries that will show the real consequences of climate change.
Starring this documentary by Di Caprio I think it's a good idea, since, apart from being an activist from an early age and having been designated 'UN Messenger of peace', being a public and well-known figure gives more visibility to the message to be transmitted.Thanks to the different witnesses that Di Caprio meets around the globe, we can perceive the urgent need to change our habits if we really want to preserve nature and our planet.
There are messages of concern, anger, frustration, but one that I find personally hopeful is that one of Dr. Piers Sellers of NASA, who despite showing a simulator of how climate change is affecting the Earth, with consequences such as rising temperatures, melting poles, deforestation, conveys a positive, hopeful message, saying that despite the difficult and complicated time we are in, we can still reverse the situation. 'I still have faith in people', Dr. Piers said. A message that gives hope to think that we can still do something to reverse the situation. But it has to be now. Let's be aware of the real problem of the situation. This goes beyond one's political ideas, this global warming is real and is at a critical moment.
Let us not look the other way, let us think that it does not go with us. Let us be aware of what we can do, starting by changing consumption habits, voting for those who really care about it and not for those who take advantage of the situation to enrich themselves.Great job of Di Caprio, whose mission, in this case, is nothing more than inform of the serious situation in which our planet finds itself, with the witness of different people that struggle to try to change the course of our planet. One of the things I like the most is that even Leonardo is considered an activist, at no time he's not considered to be a material expert. He admits that the more he finds out about the problem, the more he realizes he doesn't know anything.
He sets out the facts and hopes to see what we can do with that information. For the realism of the facts, the contrasted information, the commitment of those present in the documentary and the feeling of reflection that leaves you when you have just seen it, for me, the score is 10."
" It is our responsibility to protect the Earth Planet
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,9,"This documentary demonstrates a lot of environmental problems in different countries and areas, interspersed with comments and opinions from some important politicians, professionals and specialists.I think Sunita Narain is the most thought-provoking person in the documentary movie. She is very concerning about the environmental problems in India, meanwhile, she appealed other people (including people from other countries) to protect the earth together.After watching the movie, I learned more about the environmental protection and realized it is indeed a critical problem. More and more people should pay more attention to the earth environment and start from our own to protect the planet we live in.I give 9 stars for this documentary. Actually it is really an excellent movie even though some conditions are depicted exaggeratedly. I heard some scientists said that ""Global warm"" was a big lie, but this movie gave me a lot of thought, I believe I should search more information to learn more about this. Whether it is a lie or not, protecting our planet is the responsibility of all of us."
" A thought-provoking world that I never concern.
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,10,"This is a kind of most impressive movie what I see ever, due to the climate change warming over the world, I'm surprised at how people still escape to face the serious problem which effects our life forever. based on the climate issue, somebody looks it as alive issue, on the other hand, someone looks it as a profitable business, this is make us depressedIn the movie, I was really shocked at the governor in unite state, especially with DONALD TRUMP, environment is publish for everyone which has responsibility to effort the natural, especially as a development country status. how much we consumed and destroyed, we should recovery it.Be friendly with with other species of creatures, we should take more care of earth, but In our perspective, the knowledge of climate change is still deficit. For now, enhancing the education of climate issue is most topic that we need to improve and memorize it.The movie give me a different perspective of the world, then affects me to take care of our life, think about how we alive, how we eat, how we consume again."
" one step to hold down the climate
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,9,"It's a documentary about climate change, following Leonardo di Caprio. He meets many people related to the climate change and finally he gives speech in UN. I could find out how severe problem is the climate change and how will it affect our lives. I totally agree that the effect of climate change is huge, but it's hard to realize because it comes gradually and also it's starting from the production part, not the consuming part where our daily lives take place. I got shocked by the politicians who saying that global warming is not a big problem. Just for the reason that they get money and support from the fuel companies, they prevent many laws that cares about climate change to be allowed. They should rethink about what is more important. It was nice movie showing us what is urgent now and what should we do from now on."
" HUGE EXPLANATION AND AN EXCELLENT SENSE OF PERTINENCE TO TAKE CARE THE PLANET
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,10,"The documentary encourages us to take care of the planet and the different issues about the climate change. It shows how we are killing the planet and how to save it. for instead, different topics as rain-forest, pollution, what we eat, and different kind of contamination in all the world. Also it involve different actors around the world, politician, presidents, agent of the ONU and others.
its relevant to say that Leonardo DiCaprio is the most important actor here because it make us cause a thought-provoking feeling about the planet."
" amazing movie
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,8,"A good movie about global warming and a message to save our planet.
DiCaprio allows the movie to have a big audience, even if the the message of the movie is the most important, we have to admit that the messenger makes the difference.It is a dark reality with many controversies, but it is a good lesson for people.
The message is clear : we have to take care of our planet.
The mission is difficult and long but it worth.It is a struggle and the difference with magazine articles is that the climate change is your problem, it involves us to this by a great way.
It asks us to act.I give 8 stars because DiCaprio did a great job, the message is important and the scenario is really good and with a lot of information about what happened and what will happen if we stay like that."
" A documentary to make people conscious of the danger that climate change represents
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,9,"In this documentary, Leonardo Dicaprio travles around the world and speaks with different very important people to share opinions, get better informed about our climate and the impact we can have on it.
In my opinion, the most surprising fact is that the pope, probably the most important religious figure alive, supports scientists and asks people to take seriously the climate change problem."
" Everyone should see this!
",2019-05-24 00:00:00,9,"Some critics of this film say that this topic is old, and this movie brings nothing new to it. That is nonsense! This is real life and the topic won't get old at least on our time of living on this planet! I have seen many documentaries of this subject but after many inspirations caused by them, I never took big action in my living and that is one reason why the message of the climate change must be repeated. Like practising something in school or in sports you sometimes must repeat things over and over again to learn. Although I haven't taken a big step towards more sustainable lifestyle, my way of thinking has changed drastically.Some say that this documentary doesn't encourage personal action to stop climate change, but this is where I disagree. Seeing people's lives around the world you can see that everybody can't even make decisions for better climate when everyday life is more about surviving than anything else. This is why I feel extremely privileged to live in a country where I have all the possibilities to make those decisions that others can't.This documentary isn't technically a masterpiece that is a must see, but it is extremely colourful, powerful and I would recommend it to anyone of my friends, family or enemy. Its message is on point and my respect for Leonardo DiCaprio increased. And although the topic is ""old"" and ""worn-out"" I promise that you'll find something new in it whether it is information or a subject to debate about."
" we have to change our wold
",2019-03-13 00:00:00,7,"The documentary follows Leonardo di Caprio as he travels the words to examine and understand the effect of climate change and how the people we can solvent this, and also to learn more as possible ways to prevent catastrophic damage that could make the Earth unsustainable for human life. I have to admit that this movie captured my attention. From Greenland to China to Indonesia there is an abundance of examples of climate change, a numbers of animals are extinct (Dodo, Tiger Tasmanian) and what I saw it's really shocking, for example, the melting of the polar ice that runs very fast and its going to be the reason of the flood, America's mass consumption of energy compared to other countries, for example India. Rainforests are being destroyed in order to plant trees to make palm oil; one of the cheapest oils in the world. In his travel, he had the occasion to meet a lot of influential politics and scientist, like The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, President Barack Obama, Dr. Pier Sellers and also Pope Francis that he has called upon the word to accept the science of Climate Change. He makes a speech before the United States calling for greater action on this issue. The message of this documentary movie is to save our planet; climate change is having a noticeable effect on the delicate balance of the world's ecosystems and slowly it's going to destroy our world we need to be conscious and front our problems."
" Good Video with great landscapes WATCH THIS NOW.
",2019-03-13 00:00:00,8,"Before the Flood is a documentary that shows how Leonardo Di Caprio goes all around the world to see global warming effects and other contamination issues that are affecting a lot of people in places where they do not care enough about this. So that is why places like Indonesia and China have many troubles with the environment because the government does not encourage people to take care of those type of problems. As a result, The United Nations had a conference in 2015 to take part in the prevention of Climate Change effects and try to solve these catastrophic events. At this event, Leonardo speak and many people get inspired by his speech.Barack Obama for me obviously is the one that I found most interesting because he was a good president for the USA, who tried to help the environment as much as he could. Also he focuses on the next generations to take part in the prevention of climate change effects, so he encourages young people to help our home planet Earth.This documentary gave me a huge level of admiration for Leonardo Di Caprio because most of his entire time is an actor but in his free time instead of going on vacations like most of actors he tries to do something productive, that is encourage people to save our only home, the planet.I will give 8/10 because it was a beautiful video with great photos, but it was not perfect. I think that needed to be more emotional with shocking parts to show strong feelings ."
" A must see for everyone.
",2019-03-13 00:00:00,10,"The movie Before The Flood is basically Leonardo DiCaprio walking us through some of the environmental issues the world is facing by visiting affected places and interviewing some really important people that are able to provide great information about the topic and how we are swiftly destroying our planet.He makes a great comparison to a painting by Bosch he grew up looking at where. There are three panels which are basically like the stages of how ""paradise"" is being destroyed. The first panel shows Adam and Eve in a perfect paradise, the second one could be the stage we actually are in right now, where it is still a place that can be lived in but is going down, finally the third one is chaos and riot which shows how we could end up if we do not take action.What I liked the most about this movie is that as it is being told by really important people like Obama, Al Gore and Pier Sellers so it reaches out more to people rather than just another random global warming documentary.
I was mostly impressed with the fact that Pope Francis had something to say about it and that even though he is a religious influence he agrees on the science of climate change and that we should take action.This documentary made me feel guilty because I know that in some way I am part of the problem, but, it inspired me to change my daily actions. into more sustainable actions.I gave this a 10 because it explains the problem we are facing with no sort of mask, it is completely honest and inspires you to work towards a better world."
" environmental issues
",2019-03-13 00:00:00,8,"The documentary "" Before the flood"" is about a journey that the actor Leonardo DiCaprio undertakes in order to meet with different scientists and world leaders to discuss environmental issues, specifically the dangers of climate change and in the same way the possible solutions.DiCaprio, exposes the message of his documentary as comparing it to the painting "" The Garden of Earthy Delights"" , which has three panels, the first one in which we can observe Adan and Eva, the paradise, the second one, where there is overpopulation and excess, and the last one that according to DiCaprio the world is about to enter, a twisted and destroyed landscape. Through all his journey, Leonardo interviewed the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, also Barack Obama, Pope Francis, the scientist Elon Musk, and Dr. Piers Sellers from NASA, and he did it during and extensive tour to several countries of the world, questioning the issues of global warming and the impacts of climate change in countries with overpopulation.I found the Pope Francis as the most interesting character in this film, as his opinion is as important as that of a politician or a scientist, and he sees the environmental issues with a more humanistic and spiritual concern, which I think is also an important point of view to encourage humans to take action and help save the world in we all live. What most impresses me is that there are many people around the world that do not have access to electricity and to the main resources, but on the other hand there are millions of people who waste and pollute the environment and they only increase the problem of global warming and not take any action, they only allow this world to deteriorate more and more.I rated this film 8/10 because it is a very specific and detailed documentary, and the message is transmitted and understood by the viewer, but on the other side, I think that Leonardo DiCaprio should encourage more his audience to real action and worry about all the facts that he is showing to us."
" We can save the planet
",2019-03-13 00:00:00,8,"Starring Leonardo DiCaprio as the main character and narrated by him, the aim of this documentary is to raise awareness and start acting before it's too late.
Our protagonist initiated a trip to countries of every continent of the world to see how global warming is affecting different places. After meeting and talking to scientists, professionals and politicians from all over the world he could understood more about the situation on earth and what we were going through. He explains the problem, talks and fight against people who because of economical interests they deny global warming. Leo also promoted different ways to protect our planet and collected lots of signatures to start this plan.
After watching it, I felt a little bit guilty for not doing all I can do to avoid these changes and I also felt really sorry to see how the environment is getting worse and people's physical condition as well. I hope every country can change their policies and start to promote ways of protecting our precious planet.I'm giving 8 stars because it was really emotional and motivational for a really good cause and with really good content, but sometimes it was kind of boring or repetitive."
" climate change, the biggest threat for our planet.
",2019-03-13 00:00:00,10,"This documentary, based on the reality of what is happening to our planet, shows us that what we think of as a distant problem is becoming more and more real and we are the only ones who are able to solve this.The documentary ""Before the flood"", starts with Leonardo Di Caprio taking us with him trough his journey around the world and showing us the consequences that climate change has had on our planet in the last few years. Visiting different places and countries, he takes the time to interview experts, scientists, politicians and world leaders to hear their opinions about the current situation that our planet is facing. What I liked about this documentary, was that it doesn't only shows the problems but it gives us possible solutions and simple ways to help the environment and we are able to see with our own eyes the different situations that people have to face because we are not taking this problem seriously.One of the interviews that I found the most interesting, was Dr. Piers Sellers from NASA because he gave us strong facts but no matter how horrible they were, he still kept an optimistic attitude, letting us know, that there is still hope for us to change our actions and save the world.I rated this documentary 10/10, because it made myself retrain about my own actions and I'm sure that everyone who see this will feel the same way. Also it has an amazing quality and great shots."
" A movie about hope and understanding of climate change
",2019-03-13 00:00:00,10,"This movie is a documentary explaining the way climate change affects our lives and the reasons we should make a change in our behavior. \Leonardo DiCaprio, who has recently become U.N Messenger of Peace is travelling to different places around the world, places where climate change has the biggest impact, places where people have something to say about it. Sea levels are rising, ice is melting, temperature is going up, that's what that movie is talking about. Specialists explaining their point of view, optimistic or not.Leonardo DiCaprio is not just a character in the story. He is at the same time an interviewer, asking questions to the specialists, someone that the viewer could identify to, since the viewer is not supposed to know anything about that subject and DiCaprio is constantly asking questions, and the movie starts and ends with a painting related to his personal history.One person has really interested me more than the others. It's Piers Seller, a British-American meteorologist and a former NASA astronaut, veteran of three space shuttle missions. He has created a model simulation of the earth that shows for example that Europe will get colder. But the most surprising part is the fact that he is really optimistic about the future for our planet. He shows us that it's not too late to act if we want to save the planet.But this movie is not just about all the catastrophic aspects of climate change. It's about hope, solutions and understanding. To make us understand is impact, powerful images, impressive statistics are going to be present, and people like Elon Musk are going to explain to you their ideas on how to live a ""greener life"".What left an impression on me was, first of all, the images. Images of ice melting, of smoke coming out of factories, of polluted cities like Beijing. Then the solutions stayed in my head : like switching beef for chicken. Finally, the consequences if we don't react fast enough keep popping in my head : Greenland melting, agriculture collapsing, coral destroyed, methane released from the ice, bigger storms.This movie deserve a 10/10 because of the quality of the videos, the good explanation of the different points of views about climate change and the interviews with qualified and important people like Barack Obama, Piers Seller, Elon Musk, Pope Francis and DiCaprio."
" Leo
",2019-01-21 00:00:00,8,In this film i really liked the setting. I like it because they traveled to many different places around the world and showed us how each place is effecting the climate. At the end of the movie i really liked how they were showing pictures and taking at the same time. Leo Dicaprio being in the film helps the film be more successful because he is famous.
" Very Powerful
",2019-01-21 00:00:00,8,"This documentary is placed in many different parts of the world and shows you how climate change is affecting the whole world. There is also a lot of conflict in this film which pulls you in and interests you even more. All the people involved in this film feel strongly about this issue which helps you feel strongly about it to. Especially since Leonardo DiCaprio was involved, more people are interested in the film and care about the issue because someone famous is telling them to. Choosing a documentary as the genre of this film was the best choice i think. It helps get the issue across because you realize how big this issue really is, and how real it is. There is a lot of good editing in this film, like voice overs where you can hear Leonardo's powerful voice and also have images in front of you showing the issue. Overall this film was very powerful and educated me a lot on this huge issue."
" Very Informative!
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,9,"""Before the Flood"" is a fantastic documentary that utilizes strong points and beautiful imagery to relay its message. Initially, I did not realize how committed Leonardo DiCaprio was to the issue, but seeing him in this light makes me respect the man even more. He passionately guides the audience through his journey, showing us what's at stake should we continue our actions. By showing the destructions of our actions but ending with a plea of hope, this documentary is a great watch for anyone interested or uninformed about the very real issue we face today of global warming and climate change."
" Informative and Interesting
",2018-11-26 00:00:00,10,"It is unbelievable to think that in our everyday lives, every time we turn on our cars, eat meat, consume foods that contain palm oil, etc, we are leading the world to a higher climate. Through watching ""Before the Flood"", I can see now that minimal steps are no longer what we need to reverse the very real issue of Global Warming. The several speakers in the documentary have made it clear that this is a global issue and needs to be treated as such. ""Before the Flood"" is a very informative video and also interesting to watch. I would recommend every person to watch this, so we can all begin to make a difference in the issue of climate change."
" Worrisome
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,10,"Before the Flood is an excellent documentary, realized in 2016, about global warming and consequences of it. Leonardo Di Caprio is the narrator of the movie, and we follow him around the world to discover beautiful nature landscapes than humans destroy day after day.
During this documentary we understand why the situation of planet is unsettling. Everywhere on earth we can see human impact because of globalization. Indeed, today all countries want to develop their economy (India, China) or keep them conform of life (USA). However, the price of this is planet destruction. Now, Arctic goes away, sea level is rising, rain forests are burned to plant trees for palm oil, over consumption of beef increase pollution and green energies are not used enough. Moreover, a lot of politicians continue to deny climate change because of the lobby industries, so no real environmental policy is set up.
In the movie when Leonardo Di Caprio visits different places, he talks about problems at this place but also solutions that can be taken. It's illustrated by Paris summit, when Elon Musk says we need to tax carbon or the moment where a scientist suggests switching beef to chicken. Indeed, a good thing with this movie is that it talks not just about what is wrong on the planet, but gives solutions and promote current good actions.
To conclude, like the painting The Garden of Earth Delight on the movie, earth can be a paradise for humanity. Nevertheless, because of over population and their execs earth will become a nightmare if we continue. This is why I think everybody need to see this movie to realize that we need to change and quickly."
" Incredible documentary that is absolutly mind - blowing
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,9,"Before the flood
''Surely we have a responsibility to leave for future generations a planet that is healthy and habitable by all species''- Sir David Attenborough. Before the flood is an incredible documentary to show people that we are actually the main problem that our climate is changing and that this will have a negative affect for our future. The documentary is directed by Fisher Stevens and released on October 21, 2016. Main actor Leonardo DiCaprio meets many scientist, activists and world leaders to discuss the dangers of climate change and possible solutions.
The message behind the documentary starts with showing us a mind-blowing masterpiece from the Early Netherlandish master Hieronymus Bosch, which shows us how the world was when the first People Adam and Eva arrived and how our affect will change the world in a terrible way. This painting has inspired Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child. Leonardo DiCaprio travels to different countries like China and India to see the impact of climate change. Also we see first how Greenland's melting ice becoming a heat creator instead of reflector. And we see how Miami Beach is having to literally raise the elevation of its roads to combat rising ocean waters. We also see how developing communities in places like India are already battling pollution even as their population doesn't entirely have access to power. If and when they do make coal-produced electricity widely available, the climate change problem only becomes worse. The future is in the hands of the people.
The documentary highlights specific changes that citizens can make as simple as changing one's diet. If citizens stop eating beef from their diet, a significant portion of that pollution would be decreased.
So climate change is real and will have negative effects for our future. But there is hope. However, Leonardo DiCaprio explained us what we can do to protect ourselves from climate changing. He recommends consuming differently and voting for leaders who fight for climate change. We are the last hope."
" We are the last best hope of Earth
",2018-11-15 00:00:00,10,"""You are the last best hope of Earth. We ask you to protect it, or we and all living things we cherish, are history."" - Leonardo DiCaprioThis is just one of many powerful quotes that are part of this honest and convincing documentary, created by Academy Award winner Leonardo DiCaprio.
DiCaprio, who acts as a narrator, takes the viewer on a journey to see and understand the threatening effects of global warming worldwide.
He starts to talk about the painting called ""The Garden of Earthly Delights"", which plays a tremendous role in understanding the problems of global warming. The painting is made out of three parts/stages that show the impact of human actions on the environment. In the first stage, the world is a paradise with an incredible variety of plants and animals- almost like a paradise, in the second stage, human beings start to enter the world and everything starts to change and gets worse. The third part of the painting is a devastating one because all the beautiful creatures and plants are gone, people are diseased and the world that once looked like a paradise is gone.
DiCaprio visits many places worldwide that are dramatically affected by climate change, such as the melting icecaps in Antarctica, the flooded streets of Miami, the clear cut forests in Brazil, etc.
The movie also sheds light on the role of politics when it comes to climate change and how dangerous it is that the vast majority of Republicans deny that our actions lead to climate change and global warming. It also reveals how big companies try to influence and bribe politicians worldwide to make sure that they can keep on making huge profits.
Personally, I think that everybody should see this movie to fully understand the impact of our actions on the environment. It will definitely confront you with shocking images that will make you rethink your everyday life choices. It makes you realize that the painting ""The Garden of Earthly Delights"" is not just a painting - it is our reality and it could become our future.
Even though Leonardo DiCaprio is not a scientist, he manages to give you an in depth look on the serious problems we are facing as a society. So, instead of wasting our time by discussing whether it is right or wrong that an actor is talking about environmental problems we should talk about what we can do as a society to save our planet.
The movie makes the problems and threats of global warming much more tangible while at the same time leaving you with many tips on how you can make a difference when it comes to global warming."
" Before the Flood: A View of Reality
",2018-11-15 00:00:00,10,"'Before the Flood' is a film that reveals how powerful humankind is and how easy it is for us to destroy our own world. This movie is not a drama, it is a documentary, which somehow can be even worse, since it shows a truth that is hard to deal with. It stars Leonardo Di Caprio, who narrates the story and shares his own experience related to activism in organizations that fight the cause of climate change. He is known to be an important influencer and supporter of the protection of the environment.
The movie shows many scenes where we are able to see how our human actions have damaged different regions of our planet and how communities and other species have been affected, too. Leonardo talks with many important characters during the film, like governors or ambassadors, who explain in detail how these problems caused by the human race affect directly the communities where they belong. We, as watchers, become witnesses to how those damages on the environment were caused and what the consequences are.
During the movie, Leonardo visits some specific places: Like India, China, Greenland and Antarctica. This way, we can see how serious the situations of these regions are nowadays. When he goes to Greenland, for example, he finds a rope that was positioned vertically under the ice five years ago as a measurement method and now it was on the surface, which evidences how much ice has melted during that period. He explains that this is a fact to worry about because it is the consequence of human participation in the depletion of the ozone layer. He also comments with a scientist about bigger problems that would arise later if this situation does not change: like a significant rise of the ocean levels and the loss of some islands under the water. On the other hand, when he visits China, he meets a governor that shows how he took care of the situation in the city and what his contribution was. As he travels, Leonardo discusses these environmental issues with many scientists, governors and other public icons that provide their point of view about how these problems can be reverted. This is what contributes to the realness of the arguments presented in the movie. The same happens with the images shown, that consist of a shocking view of a cruel reality.
Even though it is hard to face the fact that the content of this film is a reflection of a tough situation, it is important to be aware of the seriousness of this global problem, since it concerns all of us. This movie is a chance to analyze our own actions and decide if we are willing to change the course of events. It is an opportunity to see how our brothers and sisters from other communities suffer because of little actions that we can easily change, and to think about the solutions presented in the movie, so as to determine if they may work or if we should come up with new ideas. It is a chance to face reality and comply with the film's message: Let's do something about it."
" When the environment become a disaster
",2018-11-15 00:00:00,9,"Directed by Fisher Stevens, Before the Flood is a documentary about the environment. Leonardo DiCaprio is the star of the movie, but also the narrator. This movie was release in 2016 and was shot all over the world. We can see places like India, Indonesia, China, USA, Greenland...
The films opens in Greenland, where we can see how much the snow has melted and what the consequences of this are. It's really shocking when you see how much melted in the last 5 years. When you know what the disasters that the snow is creating are, it's really scary. When they go to Asia, it's also very scary. The air is so unbreathable that you can't even go outside without a mask. In addition, when you see how people live in India, and how they make heat, you really feel guilty and you feel that you are living like a princess. Once they go back to the USA, and you see how people react with that major problem, you are shocked. The documentary ends with some advice to help the earth.
In the documentary, you can watch interviews with some of the most influential people in the world. When you see this movie, you can't feel nothing. This movie shows you what we are doing to our planet. They make us aware about what is going to happen if we don't react. It's a very powerful documentary. Everything that is shown is making to react. At first, when I saw Leonardo DiCaprio as the star of the movie, I didn't get it. However, when you know that he has been involved in the environment for a long time, you understand why he is here. In addition, it's a good thing because his presence can attract people for watching this movie.
To conclude, I really think that it is a good movie. Everybody needs to see this. A lot of people are not aware of what we are doing to our planet. It's really good that a movie and a superstar like Leonardo DiCaprio try to show what is happening on earth. This movie makes you think about your life and how you consume. At the end of the movie, they give some good advice to help our planet and our environment. Even if you don't like documentaries, or if you don't care about the environment, you should watch this movie because you will learn a lot."
" A documentary that will definitely change your mind
",2018-11-15 00:00:00,10,"I would more likely call Before the Flood a drama than a documentary, as it shows the impact of climate change in the most thought-provoking and realistic way possible.
Directed by Fisher Stevens, Before the Flood is not a typical Leonardo DiCaprio movie. The famous actor used his popularity to draw attention to our planet and its environment. DiCaprio, who is not only one of the stars, but also the narrator of the movie, visits different regions of the world and is confronted with the mind-blowing damage that is done to our planet every day due to climate change. In addition, he got the chance to talk to some of the greatest experts of climate change. Therefore, the movie delivers shocking information about how our beautiful planet is dying right in front of our eyes every day.
In one of the most impressive scenes of the documentary, Leonardo DiCaprio flies over parts of the oil sand regions in Canada. Seeing those pictures is truly frightening and he says that it ""kinda looks like Mordor"" from Lord of the Rings. Another eye-opening scene is when he travels to the Amazon rainforest and the viewer can have a look at the burned down parts of the once flourishing ecosystem.
As I am not capable of putting the amazing, yet appalling recordings into words, I can highly recommend Before the Flood to anyone who is even just slightly interested into the planet we live on. I can almost guarantee that watching this incredible documentary will change your mind about your habits and about the way we treat the planet."
" Before the Flood
",2018-11-15 00:00:00,7,"Stars by Leonardo DiCaprio and directed by Fisher Stevens, the documentary is trying to increase the awareness of the climate change in order to save the planet.The movie shows the causes of the climate change, and how dangerous it is to our planet. Even though the scientists have known about the problem of global warming for more than half a century we are still facing the effect of it. Some of the problems that the world will face if we keep doing what we do are: the disappearing of Greenland, rainforests and the sea levels rising. It also gives some of the solutions such as putting a tax on using carbon, stop using fossil fuels and stop eating beef. The movie has a good imagination of the future depending on scientists' researches. Part of the movie has taken place in the UN Climate conference, which was in Paris in 2015, and it showed that not all of the politicians were in agreement of the impact of climate change. Some of the recommendations that the movie suggested are: vote for leaders who will fight for climate change and consuming differently.The documentary is great if you are concerned about the climate change and how big the impacts of climate change are."
" Resonate Movie
",2018-11-15 00:00:00,8,"Are you aware of the impact that Climate Change has in your daily life? Would you sacrifice any aspect of your daily routine to make a better world? Before the Flood is a documentary that shows how the climate change is affecting the Earth and how our decisions are leading to the destruction of the world. Leonardo DiCaprio, the well-known American actor, director and Messenger of Peace of the United Nations, travels all around the world to learn more about the damage on Earth and meets with influential personalities of different countries.
This film begins showing the stunning Hieronymus Bosch's masterpiece ""The Garden of Earthy Delights"" and Leonardo saying how inspire was this paint for him, due to the fact that was hang in his crib when he was a child. This mesmerizing piece of art, painted between 1490 and 1510, represents three stages of the Earth that he uses as reference during the movie. As he travels to examine the effects of climate change in different areas of the world, he learns more possible ways to prevent catastrophic damage.
Before the Flood, directed by Fisher Stevens, captures Leonardo DiCaprio as he interviews individuals from every facet of society in both developing and developed nations, who provide unique and resonate views on what people must be doing today and in the future to prevent catastrophic disruption of life on our planet. During his trip he meets with scientists, activists and world leaders, such as President Barack Obama, Secretary of the United Nations and Pope Francis, in order to discuss the dangers of climate change and possible solutions. His journey is a look at how climate change affects our environment and what society can do to prevent catastrophic disruption of life on our planet.
In order to reduce the impact of climate change, the movie encourages us to control what we consume and buy in our daily routine, and to vote for those leaders who fight for the climate change. We are the last hope of the Earth."
" BEFORE THE FLOOD, WE NEED TO CHANGE OUR ACTIONS TO ENVIRONMENT.
",2018-11-15 00:00:00,10,"Before The Flood was directed by Fisher Stevens, who is an American actor, director, producer and writer, spent around three years to finish this film. In addition, the appearance of Leonardo DiCaprio, who is known as a responsible person to environment, contributed to the huge succession of this film. Narrated as the documentary film, they went to many countries to see the devastating impacts of climate change, what human had done, and what are we facing today.
During the movie, they mentioned many animals were extinct and our economy is based on fossil fuels. Somewhere will disappear in future if global warming is not reduced. Unfortunately, the politicians, who do not believe in the scientific community, due to fossil fuel companies paid for them to denied climate change. In my opinion, soundtrack is one of the things which contributed to this succession. It was so touching while I was watching.
Before I had watched this movie, my teacher gave me and list of actions which help our planet preserves. I had six-no answers per thirteen. I thought about those questions that can I change my answers again while I was watching this movie. Moreover, I had known the effect of global warming before, but I did not know exactly, particularly the consequences of what we did. A film that gave people a sense of urgency, that made us understand what particular things are going to solve this problem. These are the things that are really going to make a massive difference.
RECOMMENDATION: This movie is totally different to others. You should watch it at least once. This movie suggests that we can change the fact, so start at the small thing in our life style, such as consume differently, and vote for the leader, who supports to avoid climate change."
" A perfect movie that reminds you what counts in life
",2018-11-15 00:00:00,10,"""You are the last best hope on Earth. We ask you to protect it or we, and all living things we cherish, are history."" -Leonardo DiCaprio
The title of the movie sounds like a dramatic movie and when you look closer behind the scenes is it that in a kind of way. The movie ""Before the Flood"" is a great documentary from October, 2016 about what is happening with our planet and all living things on it what will happened if we do not change our way of life.
The movie star Leonardo DiCaprio, who wants to use his celebrity status to let all people know what we do with our planet and how this affects the future. He talks about sensitive problems like the way we affecting our ecosystem and how global warning will affect us when we are not able to change our lifestyle, so that the environment can benefit from our actions.
In my opinion, ""Before the Flood"" is an amazing, profound movie that could have the possibility to change the world to a better place when we watch. This movie touches you, even if this is not often regular for a documentary. The way they connected relevant scientific facts with real emotions and opinions from people all over the planet is for me an element that made the movie definitely a masterpiece.
When I was watching this movie I was really impressed by the whole scientific facts from all the scientifics like Dr. Enric Sala, Dr. Micheal E. Mann and Prof. Jason E. Box and the deep quotes from Leonardo DiCaprio who reminds you how serious this situation is make it definitely worth spending 96 minutes of life watching this movie."
" Before The Flood is one of a kind, an amazing documentary that can make people move foreward.
",2018-11-15 00:00:00,10,"""When you go up there and look at it with your own eye, how thin the world's atmosphere is, tiny little onion skin around the Earth...it's an astonishingly fragile film.""

" Let's save our planet before it's too late!
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,9,"""Before the Flood"", directed by Fisher Stevens (with Leonardo Di Caprio as lead actor) is a documentary dealing with the issue of climate changes and the appalling effects it's having on our planet. During the course of the movie, Di Caprio will be travelling all around the world, showing to the spectators the terrible effects of global warming and interviewing inhabitants, political figures and scientists on this major topic.
I think this documentary has no age limits and everyone should watch it in order to raise awareness of how our bad actions and habits are ruining our planet.
I was seriously shocked by the severe pollution which Is affecting Beijing, the ice melting in Greenland and scientists' prediction about world climate's future.
I think this is a great documentary dealing with an extremely important issue, but I've not rated this movie 10/10 because I think there were much more things to say on this topic and the director should have filmed less politics' interviews and more natural consequences of climate changes."
" You are the last best hope of the Earth
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,10,"This epic documentary follows Leonardo di Caprio as he travels the words to examine and understand the effect of climate change, and also to learn more as possible ways to prevent catastrophic damage that could make the Earth unsustainable for human life. I have to admit that this movie captured my personal attention.
From Greenland to China to Indonesia there is an abundance of examples of climate change, a numbers of animals are extinct (Dodo, Tiger Tasmanian) and what I saw it's extremely shocking, for example, the melting of the polar ice that runs very fast, America's mass consumption of energy compared to other countries, for example India.
Rainforests are being destroyed in order to plant trees to make palm oil, one of the cheapest oils in the world, which makes companies huge profits, all of that it is extremely unsettling.
In his travel, he had the occasion to meet a lot of influential politics and scientist, like The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, President Barack Obama, Dr. Pier Sellers and also Pope Francis that he has called upon the word to accept the science of Climate Change.
He makes a speech before the United States calling for greater action on this issue.
The message of this documentary movie is to save our planet, climate change is having a noticeable effect on the delicate balance of the world's ecosystems. We can not change back so it's important to control what we will do, what we consume and develop a human sense of emergency. 
I love the activism of Leonardo di Caprio 
I think that a general audience could see this movie so I strongly recommend It.
I gave 10 stars because I was surprised how soon disaster is looming ahead."
" An amazing movie how show you about the impact of the global warming
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,9,"This documentary started with an important reflection about the painting ""The Garden of Earthly Delights"" and then we continue with a quick show of the ambient problems affecting different communities. after that, we continue on the trip among Di Caprio visiting different important people to know there different aspects from the environmental warming.My first impression about this documentary took a different expectation about the high problem and how different people deny that problematic.
I recommend this movie because all the people can see the reality of what happens I the world, and how our actions can affect considerable different part of the world. If we reduce some diary thinks, we will change our future.
I'd like to share my review rating a 9/10 because I thing this documentary can share more. And will be more interesting in different problems.Its for a homework no pay attention"
" amazing cast not only can act, but also sacrifice for society
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,10,"Before the flood ,which was my first time to see another movie acted by Leo Di Caprio besides TITANIC,I had to say it shocked me so much. I believed this film also will influence the other number of audiences since you'll sink in the global environment crisis .
From depiction of ancient painting to spread the UN action ,from fossil fuel pollution to massive bold mine,from the melting of iceberg in south pole to serious PM 2.5 air disaster in BEIJING CHINA, from INDIA to rain forest ,including the conversation with regular inhabitants ,politicians ,scientists, NASA researchers ,each perspective appeal the truth of climate change.
who will be the the best people to watch this film? my answer is all human regardless kids or elderly, no one should be ruled out .
many senses left me strong impression ,but I know we couldn't shy away from the facts, despite we do not be able to change back ,at least we can fall off the damages further.
I gave 10 rating of this movie due to it's worldwide ,and throughout all industrial, this movie definitely is warming the people we only need to resort to for our world is to start action right now,reducing the waste would help our generation ."
" It's a really thought-provoking movie for me.
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,10,"This movie is talking about some serious problem from earth, such as global warming, climate change, extinct animals, fossil fuels, sea levels, electricity, rainforest, and carbon etc. The main actor Leonardo DiCaprio show us what problem will happen or it's already happened about the earth, he visited so many countries and talked to some of the professional people to let us sink in these problems, and some of us just shy away from it. So I want to promote this film for everyone because we should have a responsibility to protect the earth, it's important for all of us. Although this is a film about the environment, it's not boring because the main actor Leonardo DiCaprio, he is really amazing in this movie. Why he is a great person since he not just being an actor, he also takes care of the environment, I can feel that he wants to do something to change the earth back. So if he wants to help the earth, why you can't do it? Can you imagine that, what kind of earth do you leave for your next generation if we don't preserve it? In conclusion, let's do something can help our environment after watching this movie! Let's start it!"
" Taking action for protecting our planet from global warming
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,9,"Starring Leonardo Di Caprio, this movie is considered about global warming. First of all, he began to know about climate change and how the climate change effect on our planet. He visited the various place where the real fact for the problem could sink in. For example, he visited Alaska or Miami and at the same time, he realized that our planet is in danger. He also interviewed people who are placed in significant positions like Obama. Then he could know about global warming. For example, there are a lot of extinct animals in the world, the most economy is based on fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas, etc. On the other hand, for the environment, China is prioritizing solar and wind power over coal. In this way, the movie recommended us to take action for protecting our planet from global warming like consuming differently or voting for leaders fight with climate change.People who have never thought about global warming or have thrown the trash away on the street should watch this movie. People who have considered about global warming might be able to help along because of watching this movie.Scientists have known about the problem of global warming for over half a century, but there are still problems. That is so impressive. I wondered why there are still unsettling problems despite so many people have considered about the problems deeply.I gave this movie 9 because it was so unsettling. Before I watched to see this movie, I could not imagine that such problems are looming ahead. Whoever watch this movie, people must be influenced and act for our planet. Do not shy away from taking action."
" The reality we are facing.
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,10,"Before the Flood is a real situation movie that the whole world is living. Everyone should watch this film so all of us can understand what we have and how easily it is being lost. Climate change is not a joke. It is real and right now in 2018 there is a lot of disasters happening due to this change. This movie puts all the activities we are doing to produce this climate change in a different perspective in which its clear enough that we are hurting the planet.As soon as you watch this film all this information that has been around us for a long time about global warming finally sinks in. It is shocking to see how we are destroying the planet and seems like nobody cares. Glaciers melting, air pollution and even whole rain forests are being completely cleared off because we want to consume more, or have the latest products on the market. This needs to stop and I think that Di Caprio makes a greater impact on the world's point of view because of his career, achievements and influence that he has on world's media.The world has a lot of beauty in it, just like jungles, oceans, mountains, glaciers and forests. I've been to Alaska and it's amazing the landscape you can see. I personally love the nature, and I am terrified just thinking about these nature disappearing. If we help along each other we can actually achieve something. Changing what we eat and consume or voting for people that will fight this problem are little examples of what we can do to make a difference."
" We have to think about would's climate
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,8,"Summary - This movie's main character is Leonardo DiCaprio and he will be talking with a lot of famous person about current situation of the environment all over the world.
This movie introduced about fossil fuels, climate temperature, sea level, some way to create energy, reinforce, our habitat, climate conference. All of them was so attractive topics and every topics are connected with each other, so it's easy to understand. 
 
First of all, Every person should watch this movie. The started from the viewpoint of energy, and it caused to global worming. We are sunk in about the environmental situation that surrounded us now. Especially, the scene that melting ice barge actually was so nervous. we have to rule out some option that have bad effect for environment from now on. If we don't do any different action with before, the earth will be changed back to original form. That's what every scientist worried about. Global warming is looming ahead and even now, it is causing to effect all over the world.For me, ""What are some things that will happen if the would becomes 4 degrees warmer"" was the most impressive thing in the film. I knew some thing what's happen, if global temperature will be rising before watching this video. But this video had a lot of shocking fact about it around 25 things. I thought we have to make some different for earth, not for us. Somebody said that global worming is not true, we don't have to take care for the environment. but I think it's the true that global warming was happened due to human habitats. So we have to make some changes and that's answer is in this video.I gave 8 stars for this movie. They had not only, a bunch of shocking facts, scene, and phenomenon, also a lot of solution to solve these problems. I thought every people should watch it and it could cause resorting to action from now. But they had vocabulary a little difficult, so just a little difficult to understand. However, totally awesome movie."
" wonderful documentary
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,8,"This movie is a documentary about climate change that has as protagonist the famous actor Leonardo Di Caprio. In this movie it's showed how the use of fossil fuels are destroying our planet. There are a lot of unsettling images about rain forests and the arctic pole, but also from places where people live, like for example Miami, where in sunny days water comes up from manholes and causes floods. 
This documentary can be really useful to let people know about what's really happening in our planet at this moment. This movie is recommended to everyone, because there are a lot of interesting items that can help in learning what's the right thing to do to save Earth. Also children can watch it, because it talks about important things. It's really well exposed and the language is not so specific: it can be really useful for children, because thanks to this video they can rapidly start to take care of the planet and that's the only thing to do to save the planet. Children are our future, so to start right now the change we also have to educate children.I gave this rate to the movie (8/10) because I really liked it, I think that everyone can learn something by watching this movie, and they also did a great thing by using L. Di Caprio as the main actor, because he has a bigger appeal than any scientist, so the movie can be watched by more people. The only thing that I didn't liked so much is that sometimes it was really slow and boring, but I think that it's a problem of every documentary, not only of this one."
" Climate changes are for everybody
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,10,"The main topic of the movie is climate change, its consequences all around the world and the possible solutions such as prioritizing wind and solar power over coal. It is described through the experience of Leonardo Di Caprio: he is very concerned about climate change but also willing to bring about a change. He says that everyone should be concerned with the negative changes that are looming ahead on our earth, especially global warming; he manages to make you fell horrified about how much we are damaging our planet and wanting to change back to the past when our world was less polluted. Everyone should watch this movie as it is a very great opportunity to make you reflect on very important issues and nobody should shy away from this environmental problems because if we want to change something we have to do it all together."
" we can do something
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,10,"The movie shows the parts of our earth that are always hidden from our eyes: from the forest in fire to all the population that is suffering for our fault. climate change it's not about the temperature getting hotter; it's about killing animals to the point they're extinct, filling our atmosphere of pollutions and get the earth on her knees because we think that we can't do anything. This documentary shows that we can do a lot of things, like switching from beef meat to the chicken, or use a renewable source energy, instead of oil and coal.
Leonardo Di Caprio is not just a pretty face in this documentary, he travelled a lot and studied everything he could about climate change, he knows what he's talking about, he met a lot of important politicians in order to make them understand the danger of climate changing and he fights to prevent the catastrophe that will come if we don't change ours habits.
We need to role out oil and coal, because it's killing not just our home (the planet), but also our lives, our children's lives and our dear friend's lives, so we need at least to try to change back.
Usually I would recommend this film to adult people, but what we are doing and what we are creating is shocking and everyone must watch it, even the children, so they understand what problems we are facing and they'll star doing something.
Before watching this documentary I already knew that climate change was an issue, but I thought: ""I' m just a little person, what can I do? The people that CAN do something aren't doing anything, so why should I do something? Maybe climate change is not a so big issue and if I want to do something I would have to buy expensive things"".
After this documentary I saw what climate change really is: scientists aren't exaggerating the problem and I can help to save the world even doing little and easy things like controlling what I'm going to do next: what I eat, what buy, where I get the power from and who I vote (because you have to remember that our governments are doing nothing because more than half of politicians have financials shares of oil and coal industries)."
" The last call to the Earth's inhabitants
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,9,"This movie offers a good report about climate change and the researche, started around half of a century ago, that has been made on this matter. Leonardo Di Caprio's presence in the movie helps people to get more closely in touch with the thesis proposed and the various discussions with scientists and professors can give accurate knowledge of this big issue we should all be deeply interested in. The title of the movie evokes one of the many terrible consequences of climate change on the environment: the rising water level of oceans and seas. 
The nature of the issue tracted is one of universal interest, even if the ideal target seems to be younger generations: children and teenagers, who will be adults tomorrow, are the only categories of the population who have a chance - the last one, actually- to create a world that hopefully will be different from the one they have inherited from their parents, a world that puts the immediate gain of money or the rapacious search for resources before the stability and sustainability of the ecosystem they live in.
The director decided to mix many different situations in order to create a final product that is never boring and, on the contrary, can let the viewer feel immersed in the stunning and often terrifying images on the screen.
It is probable that this incredibly big problem will start to sink in."
" Interesting film about climate change
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,10,"Summary of the film
Before the Flood is a film by Leonardo Di Caprio in which we can concern about climate change and its dangerous and appalling effects. The documentary starts with a story told through the painting ""The Garden of Earthy Delights"". It continues talking and exploring topics like extinct species and fossil fuels economy. As we can see in the film, fossil fuels are the most destroying elements for our planet as they are the main cause of climate change. This means that the consume of fossil fuels is leading into some tragedies like the Artic's melting, fact which is looming ahead.
The film also addresses the difference in climate change and environmental impact between developed countries and non developed countries. Some times, people in non developed countries resort to destroying forests, or polluting rivers and lakes just because this is the only option they have to earn some money to survive. 
In the documentary we can also realize that some politicians and political pundits deny climate change because they are paid by the fossil fuel companies to do that.
In the end, it suggests to us some recommendations that we should put on practice in our lives because they are less harmful for our planet.Who should see this film?
In my opinion, everybody should be concerned about climate change, as it is one of the most important problems we have to face up with, so I think that everybody should see this film in order to sink in all the information and start helping the planet along.Who/What left an impression on you?
Before watching this film, I was already informed about climate change as it is one of the issues that worries me, so I knew most of the terrible consequences. However, I was really impressed to see that some cities could be flooded if we don't stop global warming.Rating
I would recommend the film to anybody who wants to contribute to help the planet. From my point of view the documentary is very well done as it shows that climate change is real and its consequences will affect everybody."
" True Facts about the conditions of Mother Earth
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,10,"This documentary covers with a wide range of topics the immense problem that is climate change. In the whole duration of the video a visual and crude reality is presented to the spectator in a very effective way; while i was watching it i was able to sink in more on this very complex phenomenon.
Di Caprio was able to communicate the necessity of world and the need of cooperation that must be present between the nations of the planet, this problem is real and it has to be solved before it's too late to change back.I recommend this documentary to anyone, the job that it has done reminding that an huge danger is looming ahead of us is exellent.I was already aware of global warming and of it's totally negative effects on the planet but this video increased my awareness on the topic. I was able to see from a new perspective the appalling effects that global warming is having on a huge part of the human population. Entire islands are being swollen because of sea level rising, the one who did the least now are suffering the most and with them our planet too.It's truly shocking to know that if we don't do something we will end up killing us all."
" We must save our planet as soon as possible.
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,10,"This is an excellent, powerful and inspirational movie which makes you see what you kind of already know, but don't want to think off - climate change is a problem far more complicated than humans. I think everyone should see it. Climate change has not completely sunk in. We don't think about the impacts our lifestyle has, and that we must put an end to this cycle.For me, it was really hard to watch it because all that it says it's true, we're destroying our own planet. The message is well received. We have to change our lifestyle and we have to do it now. This is not something you can not role out. We, humans, are destroying the environment and the ecosystem so fast that it is impossible for it to heal itself. It's so sad to watch what we are doing by consuming certain product and things. I gave this film a 10. It shows what has been happening recently,how it's being handled and how we can help along the planet."
" A really experimental movie which try to open our eyes.
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,9,"It's a really experimental movie in which you can see all the climate problems that our world has nowadays.In this film, Leonardo DiCaprio tries to open our eyes and show us that a true disaster is looming ahead of us and if we don't stop it now, it will be an irreversible problem. He shows us our world in a different point of view. He is not only talking about USA or Europe, he is also talking about what is happening in the third world. Probably one of the goals of this film is to represent different society problems because of the climate change, for example with the woman in India or the presidents of the little islands. Actually, we can't change back our past actions and decisions but I think this film is helping us along to understand the consequences and it's sinking that we have to be more respectful with the environment."
" How we are killing the planet
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,10,"It is known that human beings are the most dangerous and lethal creatures that have ever existed, and it is clearly captured in this amazing film that makes the unsettling reality of climate change sink in. It explains with detail how the human impact is really deleting all that we know and love about nature.Every person should see it, and more if their republican thoughts have clouded their mind, because it can be assured that this documentary will change even the most close-minded on the United States.The think that what most impresses is the cruel reality that we are used to shying away from and how much can we do all together to change the catastrophic situation of the planet.My rating is a perfect ten because I think that this movie talks about a really important topic in a very direct way, and that makes it a must-see for every person interested in the situation of the planet."
" Unsettling....
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,10,"This shocking documentary shows you about how our earth has changed so far and how it will change in the future. It is not just the global warming we have to face there are several more problems.
You should really watch this movie especially if the consequences of climate change have not sunk in now. How beautiful the world can be is also shown and that is why the movie suggests you not to shy away from the problems we have to deal with. 
There are lots and lots of documentaries which try to convince people to change their lifestyles but this one is unique. Not only because Leonardo DiCaprio is playing a central role in it, also because he really shows his personal opinion and he acts like an example of how everyone of us should embark on a solution to those problems.
Although you may not be interested in climate change watch it and then decide if you still want to do nothing. One thing is for sure, we can never change it back to how was before."
" Unsettling but mind-changing documentary
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,10,"We were watching this movie in English class as we finished the topic ""The environment"". I couldn't have wished for another summary of this week.
The documentary basically is about Leonardo DiCaprio (United Nations ambassador) travelling all over the world - to Greenland, Beijing, India, Sweden, Canada - in order to give the audience a shocking report of the real situation we find ourselves in right now. 
Due to this movie, this whole catastrophe properly sunk in. Consequences of greenhouse gases and global warming have impacted everyone and that documentary was so touching and convincing - I would bet if you forced Donald Trump to watch this move, he'd rethink his decisions on the convention on climate change in 2015.
DiCaprio makes it clear that bad things are looming ahead caused by global warming and watching that documentary can be the first step for everyone to make a change and get at least a realistic opinion on that subject."
" Before the Flood is a fascinating, yet terrifying, glimpse into the damage we are doing to our planet
",2018-04-09 00:00:00,10,The damage we are doing to our planet is irreversible and the collaboration of National Geographic and public figures is exactly what we need to get people talking about climate change once again.
" amazing documentary!!!
",2018-04-01 00:00:00,10,"After watching this documentary, i was completely frozen and amazed! this documentary really is a wake-up call for everyone. i think if everyone watched this movie, we would all have a better understanding of our own planet. i really want to thank Leonardo DiCaprio for making such an interesting documentary which is worth your time. i really recommend this documentary which as i now understand is on Netflix."
" Perhaps one of the most important documentaries of our time
",2018-03-23 00:00:00,8,"BEFORE THE FLOOD is an engaging documentary that reminded me of the same quality as a Werner Herzog film. It stars the constantly improving Leonardo DiCaprio as the host, exploring the topic of climate change and visiting various places in the world on the front line: the palm oil plantations of Indonesia, the melting ice shelves of Greenland, the horrendous tar pits of Canada. The topic is explored in a clear and concise way, without preaching, just focusing on facts and methodologies that could be utilised to prevent the kind of mass damage than mankind is doing to our planet. An all-star cast of interviewees helps to make this a thoroughly watchable documentary, perhaps one of the most important of our time."
" Use your clout Leo
",2018-03-21 00:00:00,1,"After reading some of the reviews I realized where Leo could really be of some help. Free, non toxic or planet harming energy sources are abundant. But the oil companies buy up any and all ideas and inventions that might cost them there strangle hold on energy profits. Leo should out his neck on the chopping block and get the oil companies to hand over all of the great ideas that have they're purchased over the years from people who were actually trying to make a difference. Call me crazy and a conspiracy theorist. But the above mentioned is 100% true."
" Climate Change?
",2018-03-21 00:00:00,1,"Whether climate change is hogwash or not I don't see any attention being paid to the deforestation of our planet? The fishing out of our seas? The poisoning of our water? The current drinking water shortage that's never discussed? The slaughtering of our wildlife worldwide? 
Climate change is hogwash. The climate has been changing for millions of years! It's not going to stop changing. But let's please ask the likes of Costco and Walmart to stop handing out coupon books when we walk into their stores. Let's ask the Marriott hotel chain to stop giving out free newspapers at our doorstep that less than 10% of the people read. Let's STOP with the recycling nonsense. Don't pat yourself on the back because you're recycling. STOP buying plastic drinking bottles by the case. Buy a permanent drinking cup. Write to Costco, Walmart, Marriott and any other big company you see doing things that they could easily ""change"" to help this supposed climate ""change"". Climate change is political propaganda and a money grab. STOP DESTROYING OUR FOREST!"
" Oh, the humanity!
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,7,"Outstanding documentary to face the problem that is the climatic change, but it sins of certain failures.
The most serious fail that I see is addressing the cause of climate change from the point of view of fossil fossils.
Some of the biggest emitters of CO2 are the cattle and the felling of tropical jungles for the food of that won or the plantation of oil of palm and the subjects are treated of fast and superficial way in the documentary. Another mistake is to show that all countries, especially the US, are committed to CO2 reductions when most industrial countries welcomed the Paris agreement with great reluctance, For example, the Trump administration has decided not to apply the signed in Paris. Finally, I think the should talk about nuclear energy as one of the alternatives to fossil fuels.
Despite all these ""failures"", it is a great documentary and shows the public this problem and the pressures of the lobbies in the US congress."
" Good but lacking focus & direction
",2018-02-14 00:00:00,5,"I have been involved in climate change education & action for many years. I found this film lacking in direction. As a narrative, it seemed to lack direction of defining the problems and solutions in a hard hitting way. There was too much talking with experts including politicians. What I believe was needed in terms of giving the strength to the call to action was more visuals of current & possible disasters of the future. There was a strong sense of despondency that Leonardo seemed to have. This would have fitted in ok as the challenges present & future were shown. But the film needed to show more options for resolution & a sense of the wonderful in terms of what some nations are doing while balancing it out with the peril of inaction. I felt like Leonardo had given up hope, so why bother making the film. He needed to demonstrate more sense of danger danger danger... unless unless unless. These challenges should have one sitting up & paying attention but I felt like I was reclining as a somewhat miserable & pessimistic person told his story of the last 15 years. This was not meant to be a film about Leonardo & his associates. It was supposed to be a film of the people. I did not get a sense of that. Even the section filmed in India did not get amongst the local population. Instead we are listening to a well meaning but middle class Indian politician do a diatribe about US consumption. That point had some validity but again the solutions were not being effectively presented."
" Eye-opening
",2018-02-07 00:00:00,9,"The film discusses the urgency to take action against climate change because the effects of it will be devastating. Every person is responsible for their carbon footprint and can reduce it for example by eating less beef.
I liked the documentation because it opened my eyes and taught me about climate change. However, I would have liked for DiCaprio to discuss the aspect of nuclear power."
" We must change our minds from now
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,7,"This movie describes the serious pollution which humans are causing even now. Leonardo DiCaprio met some people which are fighting with pollution, listened to their stories, and concluded we must change our minds to save the earth.In the documentary, Dr. Piers Sellers, especially, made me surprised. I knew about global warming, but I didn't know about NASA's model simulation which indicated some regions that will become cooler than now. I noticed these problems are extreme and more serious than we thought.I like this movie. I got a lot of information from this movie, but I felt that there was some information that we didn't need, such as republican policies. I think this is the problem we are equally facing so this movie doesn't have to mention only republican's failed policies. It felt unnatural. Without it, I consider this movie is absolutely excellent."
" An alarmimg documentary about environmental issues
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,9,"This kind of documentary can empower people because knowledge is the beginning of change and many big and enriching moments.Sunita Narain was featured in the movie and made a big impression because she showed the huge gap of mentality between developed countries and the developing ones. This Indian woman shows us the injustice and put in the foreground the environmental issues of USA.She explains that every developed country talks about the use of renewable energy but most of them don't put their ideas into action. In particular the case of the USA who doesn't take any measure in the environmental innovation. She also talks about the two big visions and goals of developed and developing countries, for one side this aim is to make people aware about environmental issues but without showing the example but how can we talk about environmental issues when the priority to developing countries is to give at everyone the accessibility at a source of energy ? This movie shows the impacts of human activity with the use of fossil fuel, deforestation, which put endangers the planet, the animals, the vegetation and of course humanity. Different visions and points of view from the world but a same morality ... It's time to change !"
" A good idea
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,10,"This documentary makes me feel well, I realize that there are persons outside who really love our world and want to improve it, like Leonardo Di Caprio.
Although, there are not only good people.
 It is a good choice if you want to know what are doing the bad people to our environment only because they want to get money. But do not worry, Leo and other great persons are going to help us to understand what we can do to save the world.
I also recommend watch the movie as soon as possible because talk about environment problems that are happening now then, we have to watch the movie now!I like this movie because you can have different points of vision, for example, we can appreciate the Barack Obama and the Pope's opinion who agree with Leonardo about climate change. 
However, they are not the only interesting people that appear in the movie. We can see other faces like Ban-ki-moon, Elon Musk, John Kerry, etc.
But the best thing about this film is that you only have to spend an hour and a half of your life to watch it and after that your lifestyle and way of seeing things could change completely."
" Good documentary movie
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,8,"This movie provides information about climate change that challenges people around the world. Most people ,especially scientists, accept that human activities lead to this issue. However, politicians do not believe in this problem as they may close relationships with other interests if they pay more attention to resolve environmental problems.From my point of view, I was really impressed with Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, an automobile company. It is because that imposing carbon tax is the most effective way to change consumers' behaviors. At least, this method can reduce overconsuming on products that emit too much CO2 and lead people to consume more environmentally friendly products. In addition, government can manage this amount of money to resolve another environmental problem.I like this movie since it not only shows environmental problems that have already happened around the world , but also provides good information through many interviews, especially those who work to protect our world. Moreover, it leads me to see this problem through different perspectives.I rate this movie 8/10. Although it motivates and raises people's awareness of global warming, the way that this movie tells the story should be more interesting and easy to understand for children. As children are the foundation of society, this movie can educate them and also enhance them to make our world better in the soon future."
" a sincere review
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,10,"Before the Flood is a sincere and objective documentary that gives us a brief but strong look at our past mistakes and how they are coming back to haunt us. Through the documentary you will see world leaders talk and try to take action and raise awareness about this problem, that is happening in our own backyards. Seeing such a variation of powerful people giving their own prespectives gives the documentary credibility. The documentary itself is a piece of art. Every person involved had their own struggles, their own point of view, and their goal. One goal that grabbed my attention was Dr. Piers, he has stage 4 cancer and he's willling to do anything in his power to make an improvement, He has faith in all of us, that we can change and make a difference, step by step. He demonstrated that we can't be negative or scared about our future. 
 
The best part was Leo's ability to travel and explore different parts of the world trying to understand every situation's need. It was just amazing. The drive he has is just mezmerizing. If you have any type of questions about global warming or how to help the environment, this documentary will give you the facts, and different ways of how you could help right now."
" ""Before The Flood""
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,8,"The movie shows us the consequences of the global warming, and what we are going to do to solve this problem.I think Sunita Narain made an impression on me when she said: ""I'm sorry to say this, and I know you're American, so please don't take this the wrong way, but your consumption is really going to put a hole in the planet."" She has very clear ideas about what we need, for example when she said what 1 American consumes at home is equivalent to 61 citizens of Nigeria, she knows about what we need and what we must to do to solve this problem. Also she wants to inform us about what is happening in the world.I liked it, because for me it is important to be informed about what is going on in the world and now I know what I can do to make the world better. I also learned important things, like there is no support from the Unites States government against global warming and that the islands could disappear as a product of the increase in water levels.
My rating is 8/10."
" before the flood
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,8,"Before the Flood showed us how global warming is affecting the world, why this is happening, and some solutions so we can fix it.The person that impressed me the most was Jason Box, the Greenland professor, because he showed how the ice was melting, and how much ice has already melted. He also said that if global warming continues the same, Greenland was probably going to disappear. I was shocked when I saw how much ice water was going into the ocean, and how fast the water level is increasing.I really liked this documentary, because its very enlightening, it made me realize how terrible the situation is with global warming, and also now i know that if we don't do something, the planet will probably die soon and we are are not going to have a home anymore."
" Climate change is real
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,10,"The movie is about how climate change has affected our planet already. It shows us what are the causes, possible solutions and different points of view to this problem. One person that made an impression on me from the documentary is Dr. Pires Seller, who used to be an astronaut who worked for NASA. He made an impression on me because of his optimistic point of view and faith in humanity. Even though he knows all the facts and the dangers of climate change, and even though he knows we are responsible for that, he says he still has faith in humanity and he thinks we can fix it. He knows all the impacts climate change will have on our planet and he knows we need to change urgently and he still believes in us. I liked the movie because even though i knew about this problem it showed me different points of view that I hadn't thought about. Also I like how it shows me what countries are doing to deal with this problem and what I can do to help."
" Save our planet
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,9,"Before the Flood is a documentary that makes you think about how your actions affect climate change. And it has different forms of leaders giving their opinion on the subject.The best part of the film was Sunita Narain. She is an Indian environmentalist who had a one on one conversation with Leonardo DiCaprio. I loved her because during the whole interview she was very clear about what she wanted and was very realistic.She didn't believe the speech Leo was giving her and asked exactly who was going to do all those things that he was promising and hoping for. She kept asking until she found what she was looking for. And I loved that she was speaking from the point of view of a country who didn't have the resources to change to change to a more clean type of energy. I love the movie, it was eye opening. I never read anything profound about climate change - it was always a fast read. This documentary left me thinking about what I can do to help our planet. I think everyone should watch it so they can see and realize how we are killing the earth, our home. Because of this film i'm going to try to change my lifestyle to be less harmful to our planet. I hope this movie inspires everyone as it has me. So we can all accept our reality and try to change it, to improve it."
" Eye opener
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,10,"Leonardo di Caprio has travelled the world to find out it is being destroyed. And he interviews people to find a way to save it.I was never really into what the world around me was doing -how the climate changes and how in a couple of years things will be so different. I am really shocked that we let our own planet get ruined like this but what shocked me the most is that we actually can do something about it. This movie really opened my eyes and made me realize that we have to do something. Ride a bike more often, separate your trash etc. I think a lot of people are just not aware of the situation and we should all see this movie. It is really interesting how our world works. Maybe it will get people to change their way of living.Dr. Piers Sellers part was a real eye opener. Dr. Sellers works for the NASA that studies the climate changes and global warming. He told in the interview that he was diagnosed with cancer stage 4. Because he knew he that his change of surviving was really small he thought, what can I do more to save the world before I die? And he knows that we can change the world and has faith in humanity. It is beautiful that there are people in this world who think like this.I would have never chosen to see this movie for myself but because it was shown in class it has made me more aware of the situation."
" the hidden reality of our planet
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,8,"The documentary is about an actual threat to the world that politicians choose not to see, and if we do not do nothing, could led to the end of humanity.I like what Susanita Naraim said (an Indian woman featured in the film) because she was not afraid to tell the truth about global warming in India and in the different position her country was in comparison to develop countries such as United States. She seems so worried about what would happened to the people of her country, that are in an disadvantageous position, if nothing is done to improve this situation.I like this documentary because it shows the reality that most of the people are not aware of because it is hidden for political and economical reasons. Thanks to this film more people will be informed and could be able to take action and measures to prevent the disaster that is approaching to our world."
" We need to start now
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,8,"This movie was about how we are doing wrong things to our earth and how we could change those things. The most important thing of this movie it is that we have the ability to make a change in the earth but we just need to start.There was one person in the movie that made a good impression on me and it was the Mayor of Florida, Philip Levine. He made a good impression because he didn't care about the White House's support to fight against global warming so he made his own decision and increased taxes just to have enough money to do his project with one purpose, protect his citizens. The good impression was not because he did his project, it was because, for a politician, increasing the taxes is not a good idea because, obviously, no one wants to pay more money but he was thinking about the future of the people that live in Florida and will live there for the next 40-50 years. For me, his action was very kind and he deserves all the citizen's support. The value of the project was 400 million dollars.I liked the movie because they did an excellent job showing how, all over the world, we are hurting the earth and with that, we are part of the problem. Another reason was because they showed the problems but also the solutions so we can start making the things right."
" before the flood

he have concerns about the future if we don't take action, and he tell that in the future it will be catastrophic, glacier will disappear, the capacity of the world will not be enough.2) If we don't take action about this, the world can; be able to keep working, will die many people. but the politic don't want to do something because is so expensive. 3) Yes, I like this movie because now I am more motivate to take care of the world and also I can see the problem that we have in the world and the reason way they are not solved. 4) I will rate this movie with a 8, I like that have different opinions and points of view, but I think that same parts of the movie are not so good explain."

" I really belive that the film express many realities a round the world
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,7,"I think that the film makes known nowadays how is the world working, 
So the reason because i like it, is that the most important authorities in the world are realize about it and said that they will work together for a better world.the person who impressed me a little bit than the others is the Pope Francisco because he is the head of chatolic church and he talked about enviromental problems related to science and it was unusual but he is right so we have to trust in his words."

Also this film make us recognize the actual problem. 2.Yes! was amazing because was very interesting for me the gigafactories I didn't knew that also have so many facts that are occurring right know.3. Elon Musk because has a plan that is going to help the entire world he caught my attention in the part of the gigafactories with Tesla that will produce an enormous amount of sustainable energy when completed. Also the use of batteries to don't waste natural resources.
" A perfect and realistic movie about global warming
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,9,"1. The movie is about global warming and all the dangers created by humans. In fact, the main character travels around the world to see all different natural disasters, and understand every problems, and try to find any solutions with representatives of countries and industries. 2. I really liked it, because it's moving, with beautiful landscape, real population, not supposition. It is very good movie which make me consciousness about different things.3. BARACK OBAMA really Impressed me, because in the movie he said that he would like that his children see the glacier, and have a beautiful life. This man is important because he will represent freedom, hope and human equality forever."

",2018-02-01 00:00:00,10,This is an fantastic documentary because it speaks about saving our planet. This documentary teaches us how to look after our planet. We are destroying this planet without us realizing. We can watch the evidence and the consequences of global warning ourselves. We should use this planet better for our health.I like this documentary because it is a very important for society. This film is very interesting and Leo Di Caprio teaches us by visiting a lot of places and showing how the world really is.
" Before the Flood Review Adam
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,10,Before the Flood is for me one of the best movies if you want to hear about the main risks from global warming. In this documentary you will see Leonardo DiCaprio as the main character who wants to find answers about the most important question about global warming. To talk and think about global warming is today so important that you must love this documentary. For me was the memorable conversation with Mr. DiCaprio and our Pope Franziskus. He agree with the facts about the scientists. This is a hugh step for the church and the world to think about facts and religion together. And hopefully it will help us to reduce our issue for the future.
" Everybody should watch this movie
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,9,"This a really important, impressive and interesting documentary who propose us Leonardo Di Caprio and his team. In fact, this movie show us the different problems in each part of the world from Arctic to Indonesia and Amazon or India. This documentary raise awareness we need to change our way of consummation and production for us, our children / grandchildren, but also for the other who see his country destroyed because the global warming.I really like this movie because we can see all of the problem in our society. Leonardo Di Caprio show us the global warming and his consequences crossed many countries and land like in Amazon or Indonesia for the rain forest, in India and the water problem and more.In my point of view, it s Leornardo Di Caprio who surprise me the most. I knew his investment for this cause. However, it's uncommon celebrities or actors who speak and realize a movie only about the environment and the global warming. I think it's really important a person with his notoriety realizes because when celebrities teach us a lesson, more people listening and following his lesson. 
To conclude, Di Caprio his engaged about this topic and he met many people of different culture, different place in the society and we can more understand the problem of each one."
" ""Change Your Mind""
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,8,"This is a realistic documentary that talks about the problem of our planet and the global warming that every day is coming bigger and bigger, where Leonardo Di Caprio travels around the world to see the different realities of this big problem.I like it, because the movie show us the reality of what is happening with the planet and what will happen in the future if we do not stop pollution. So, the movie try to change our mind with the message inside the movie.The person who impress me in the movie was Sunita Narain because she shows to Di Caprio the differences between U.S and India about the energy and told him that the problem that american people created will be the problem in the future because she talks about that India"" wants to be like the U.S ""in the future, but the problem is that the energy that american people use is too much and she said that they do nothing to stop that waste of energy."
" We should to act now
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,10,"I am impressed with this film. I can not believe the damage the people cause on the environment. It is strong but this is the reality. Besides, we learn many things about environmental pollution in this film. We can listen to different opinions of the government and the point of the Paris Agreements. I think the majority of people who talk in this film, know of this problem and have reasonable point of view.
In my case, Barack Obama impressed me with his interview. He said: "" We are not gonna completely reverse the warming that now is inevitable but we can stop it before it becomes catastrophic"" I consider that he is realistic. He knew the causes and consequences of this problem, but he is optimistic. He believes that people can change this situation. When he talks about of the Paris agreement, he says negative and positive things, for instance the architecture to start in some countries but he said that is not enough to solve the problem. So we need to act now if we want to solve our planet.
Leonardo DiCaprio did an excellent job to. His interest is amazing. He knows how to talk to the people and respect the different opinions. 
In my final opinion this film is a good way to show children and teenagers the situation that we will live in if we do not work to help our environment now."
" Save our planet
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,9,"It is an excellent movie to understand all problems that pollution create in our planet. Leonardo DiCaprio, who lead the film, travel all over the world and talk with different people, in different countries about different type of contamination that we create.
I really like the film because It show what is happen in our planted and what can we do to save it. I think that everyone who watch the film will be aware and will help to stop pollution. 
Sunita Narain made an impression on me. She is an Indian environmentalist and political activist as well as a major proponent of development. I believe she is an intelligent woman, who know a lot of the environment and she wants to do something for it. I like Sunita because is a direct, she told Leonardo everything she think about US, no matter that he lives there."
" MY OPINION ABOUT THE FILM <3
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,8,"For me the movie was so impresing because they show us how the world is changing and also how we are destroying it, and the effects that cause the global warming.
 I like it because in a destricaly way we lear about the situation of the planet, also is a good for to learn how to the care the enviroment in diferents ways. Also the principal message of this film is HELP THE PLANET or TRY TO SAVE IT, because we are the only ones that could make changes for the future and see a better world in few years. 
The person who makes me an impression was Elon Musk because his brilliant mind, also because he is so recognized for been the creator of big companies like TESLA, PAYPAL, SOLAR CITY and SPACE X. I love his vision of changing the world and the humanity in a huge step. He want to stop global warming using solar panels also reduce the use of non renevable resources and use the sun like a form of energy, the want to the stop the use of gasoline so he create the hybrid cars (TESLA). For him help the enviromwent and the world is his priority."
" I love the documentary
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,10,"This documentary is very realistic, it's something that we are doing to the earth. They show us what's happening right now in different parts of the world and all the things we will lose with the time.
The fact that in 50 years we will never see ice again in the North Polo and a lot of animals will dissappear, makes me feel sad and kind of depressing because everything is beautiful and we don't take care of it. I like it and I hope everyone could see it.
Sunita Naraim, one of the persons who talks with DiCaprio, an environmentalist and political activist woman in India, talks about how the climate change affects the farmers and she is really angry because she said that India don not makes problems like USA do."
" The global warming should concern everyone.
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,10,"The documentary ''Before the Flood"" is about the realities of climatic change, and how climatic change is affecting many countries around the world. These effects are growing each day because human activities are destroying our world. Personally, I like the documentary because DiCaprio uses his influence in a positive way to interview important leaders and show how climate change affects many aspects around the world. Also, for me it is important to know different opinions about the reality of the climate change and learn new impacts that cause global warming. As an Environmental Engineer this situation should concern everyone and make people change their daily lives to reduce the human impact on the environment.I think Leonardo DiCaprio is the most important leader in the documentary because he uses his power as a positive influencer. Also, he wants to shows to society the consequences of global warming. Moreover, as he interviewed important leaders who explain these impact, they gave their opinions about the consequences of global warming. Some of them are positive and others negative. Also, he uses an analogy from the painting ""The Garden of Earthly Delights"" and the problems that humans are causing the planet. This analogy is something that impacted me because the painters could imagine that the world would have an environmental problem called global warming at that time."
" We need to act right now!
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,10,"The movie describes how global is getting worse. 
Every Leader in the world tries to sit together and talk about how to solve this big problem. 
I really like this movie because that movie gives me a lot of information about global warming. Land will disappear because the ice is melting. Everybody will move to the higher place and in the future the world can have world war. 
Pope Francis made an impression on me because he didn't talk a lot. He just pushed people to act right now. He suggests little things such as using less paper, using public transportation, stop dumping,......"
" Good
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,8,"This is a great movie about the consequences of humans activities on earth. It shows the reality in different ways, on every continent, in every country, and shows that everyone can be affected by global warming. I like the different speeches and different points of view that all go in the same direction. The interview with Gidon Eshel was really great because it shows that we must pay attention to our consumption and the impact of cow breeding on the atmosphere. 
He said that the environmental problem with beef consumption is the because cows produce methane and 1 molecule is equal to 23 molecules of CO2. This is a real problem and it contributes to the greenhouse gas effect. 
He has an interesting scientist vision of the situation, very rational."
" You can do something
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,10,"The film is about how people's actions can destroy the world and directly affect the environment. People do not know the magnitude of the problem. I liked the film, and I liked how Leonardo DiCaprio very clearly shows the situation. I didn't know about a lot of things that he said or other specialists said. Now I feel less ignorant about global warming.Gidan Eshel talked about how you can do something starting today. Something that I did not know is that cows produces methane: methane is worse than CO2 (carbon dioxide) because 1 methane molecule is 23 carbon dioxide molecules. So if you eat less beef or change from beef to chicken, you really can help a lot. It is very important that everybody share this, and we could inspire more people everyday to make the difference. Marimar."
" We need to change now
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,9,"Before the Flood is a documentary film that shows us the impact of polluting elements in nature.
I like this documentary because it has made me realize how I personally can change my habits and make a change.
Sunita Narain(India) made an impression on me because she shows her knowledge about the problem. For example, she said that China is investing more than the US and that is interesting because the United States is a leading country in the world and they are not doing so much for this problem.
So I think that if the United States takes the initiative, other countries would follow because is a world power!."
" A moving movie about the future reality
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,9,"Leonardo Di Caprio is the main character and shows us the future reality of our world because of the global warming. He interviews a lot of scientists, famous people and political people furthermore, we can see a lot of landscapes who are despairing. 
I like this movie because the landscapes are beautiful but he explains that the global warming will destroy the wildlife. If we want a comfortable life for our children we must act to protect our planet. 
Leonardo Di Caprio explains clearly the situation and he travels around the world to show us all the different situations. In my opinion, it's the best way to explain the situation and to show us all different countries and all different problems. 
During the movie, we can see an interview from Donald Trump. It's very interesting for me because it's the President of US and he doesn't want to act to protect the environment. I'm disagree with this political people, it's important to help the economy of USA but we need to save the environment."
" MY OPINION ABOUT THE FILM <3

" we should change our lifestyle
",2018-01-06 00:00:00,10,"The message of this documentary film is to save our planet. Each country, each continent. Our home."
" Informative and Conscience-inspiring
",2017-11-07 00:00:00,8,Have you ever thought about why some people don't believe in Global warming when it is happening before our very eyes. We have seen many symptoms and still many of us don't believe. This documentary will make you believe that Global Warming is a real thing and we are really destroying our little blue planet by creating more cities which are not so smart at all. This documentary is enough to make the case for Global Warming and how it is pulling gus towards the Big Flood.Let's not debate on all of these.Just watch and think- how to save the blue dot.
" The documentary is about the global warming, how this affects to us and what can we do to prevent a future disaster
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,10,"The documentary is really interesting because global warming is a problem of increasing intensity because a lot of people don't care about the environment and pollution. We can see different situations in different parts of the world. In some places global warming has caused a lot of damage, but the important thing that we have to know is that this problem has solutions if we act right now and all together. Finding different ways to obtain renewable energy and helping the developing countries to reduce their pollution are two solutions. I totally recommended the documentary to everyone because it's a problem that affects us all, and if we don't care now about the environment and global warming we are going to produce a big disaster in the future. In this situation we have to work together to find the best solution for all of us. The person who really can help people become aware of this situation is Pope Francis because he can make religious people accept science and support renewable energy (Gigafactory) and care about the environment. He has also recommended acts to reduce the pollution."
" Great documentary!!
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,10,"Climate change is the main issue of this amazing documentary. When a famous person like Leonardo DiCaprio brings global warming to center stage and makes us think about how important this is in the world. Between so many good scenes I can highlight the conversation between DiCaprio and Sumita Narain, when they talk about the problem in India - 30% of the population doesn't have access to energy and use coal for this because it is cheaper. But we can't imagine how harmful is to the climate. So, in my view this is the best documentary about this problem and I recommend that everyone watch and become aware."
" very interesting
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,8,"Yes, I would like to recommend this movie to everybody in the world who cares a bit about ecology and our future. I am sure that even people who don't believe in ecology could be attracted by this movie and have a new point of view about the earth. I personally felt something during this movie so why can't everybody feel the same and change the world for a better future generation. The moment when Leonardo spoke with Al Gore was such an interesting part of the film because their meeting happened 20 years before the movie but the vice president already knew what was wrong. He saw it coming. Al Gore was for sure someone very in tune with that topic but did he do something to support that cause - I don't know. Maybe nobody believed in him before or people did not take it seriously because it doesn't happen in front of their eyes and it is abstract for people who don't have any interest in life."
" The most important things for the world
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,8,"This movie mentions the most important things for everyone in the world - Global Warming. The great thing is Leonardo DiCaprio went to many places and learned about what is happening in a clear and practical way.I would like to recommend this film to young people like my little sister. My sister is a high school student. When I was a high school student, we didn't learn very much about these problems. We should have learned efficiently from a young age.In this film, an Indian lady talks about serious situation in India. She remains in my mind because I was really surprised that most people in India still don't have access to electricity. We developed countries can't imagine how our life would be without electricity. I thought her words expressed a kind of anger, upset at all developing countries. We should create a solution in order for countries like India not to face the same problems in the future."
" A reflective film
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,9,"This film introduces the problem of climate change. At the beginning, most people did not believe in climate change. This film introduces many countries' challenges in how to face climate change and their situations. They want more people to consider the effects of climate change. I will recommend this film to my friends and my family because I want more people to consider global warming and what can we do in the future. The woman who lives India impressed me. Indians also want to change their lifestyle, but their most important problem is energy - they do not have the ability to solve their coal dependency and change to solar energy. I think everyone wants to live in a good environment. We help developing countries face climate change."
" A inspiring experience
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,9,"This movie is a masterpiece by Leonardo Dicaprio and I will undoubtedly be influenced by this movie for the rest of my life. I think everybody should at least watch this documentary at least once to educate themselves (just as I did) about how urgent the situation about global warming is. The film also provides solutions and ideas about how to stop it before it's too late. I definitely recommend it, no matter if you believe in global warming or not. All human beings are responsible for all the pollution. In this movie, Elon Musk shows that with innovation and an important financial investment the solution for global warming is pretty manageable."
" Climate change: the most important issue of our society
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,8,"Before the Flood is a documentary directed by Leonardo DiCaprio, who is not only an actor but also an environmental activist. He traveled all around the world and met a lot of important people who have seen how our world is been changing. This movie is really impressive because it makes us understand that every country - above all, the developed countries - have to contribute in order to make concrete changes in the environment. Leonardo DiCaprio has had the opportunity to meet important figures such as Pope Francis who is the first Pope to really care about world problems. He wants to be involved with climate change and has even written about it. In the movie we can see that their meeting is an example of how the relationship between science and religion could be put aside in a world which is changing so fast. I really liked this documentary and I recommend it to everyone and above all to president Donald Trump who confirmed that the United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, which he said was not beneficial for U.S. economy. In this situation we don't need to think selfishly because we are living in a world where soon every kind of animal and plant will be disappearing."
" The film is about the most important problem in the world in this moment.
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,7,"The film is a documentary about the most important problem in the world in this moment. Leonardo Di Caprio travelled around the word and found explanations and answers about pollution and global warming (coal, oil and natural gas) In my opinion, people should be watch Before The Blood, because it's really important. In the film, you can see a lot of countries that have issues with coal, oil and natural gas pollution. Also, scientists explain the catastrophes around the world and explain some possible solutions for the future. The oil companies are a big problem because, with their money, they extort the people in the government. For this reason, it is unlikely the change will start with leadership from the governments. Leonardo DiCaprio is very important in the movie. With his performance, the film is more interesting and entertaining. The United Nations chose Leo DiCaprio because he is a person who always speaks about this subject and he had the correct questions for the scientists and governments. Without his presence maybe some interviews were impossible (for ex: Obama and Pope Francis I)"
" A life lesson, this documentary is essential as human who live on earth and who care about it.
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,10,"Thanks to this documentary, I learned a lot about what has happened on our earth because of human activity. I realized to what point the U.S government was corrupt and how transnational corporations destroy the planet in favor of increasing their profits. Even if they know at what point they will exhaust our natural resources and also knowingly contribute the most to global warming. The experts interviewed in this documentary are precious people such as scientists, economists, politicians and sociologists. There are a lot of interviews with scientists who specialize in the environment as well as climatologists. This documentary deals with a lot of very important problems. However if you want to know about solutions and how to completely change our lifestyle to help our earth get better you don't have to just rely on this documentary - I will recommend this documentary to everyone because it's a lesson in life.After a trip to Beijing to witness the smog and speak to experts about how releasing pollution data to citizens has helped to change public attitudes, DiCaprio arrives in India. His meeting with Sunita Narain, director of the Center for Science and Environment, provides, arguably, the key scene of the whole film. They discuss the sweet spot of the climate conundrum: how do developing nations with fast-rising populations raise standards of living for all without emitting vast volumes of greenhouse gases?"
" devastation of environment is proceeded by people
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,7,"I want to recommend this movie to everyone in the world because we can learn that we are destroying the environment through this movie. In particular, we can recognize that the quantity of CO2 emission is increasing. If the quantity of these greenhouse gases like CO2 is increasing, global warming will be more powerful. So all kinds of environmental devastation will occur more rapidly. So we must know these serious situations and we must try to prevent these problems from proceeding. This film shows us very detailed and trustful data. Specifically, I was impressed about the situation in India, where DiCaprio met Sunita Narian, Center for Science and Environment in India. She said that ""in the past, they made the problem and in the future we will make it."" In the view of India, I could understand this because the developed countries have been creating the problem in the past and India and other developed countries will continue it in the future when they get coal energy. I think that if we can not change this situation now, this devastation will continued. So we should try to solve this problem with all of the countries. Developed countries should provide the technology or skills to developing countries, and developing countries should provide the cost for those. I think that in order to solve it, we should think and do it together."
" It's a warning for humans. What you can't believe is truth.
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,9,"I love this movie. Before I watched this movie, I didn't know how serious climate change is. I just know we should protect the environment and protect animals. But I didn't know how much our planet is suffering and how terrifying it is. When I watched the part of about arctic ice melting because of climate change, I was shocked. Tons of melted ice water flowing into the ocean! Maybe in the future, we will lose all of the arctic ice, and we won't have polar bears anymore. Not just polar bears...there are many animals becoming extinct. Global warming leads to more and more flooding. The sea level is higher everyday. More and more rainforests disappear because of human greed. People want more money to support their life nowadays. But how about tomorrow? How about the future? We can't use all of the resources on earth. I believe, if we don't do something to prevent this, we will get punishment from ourselves. I'm glad to see there are so many countries joining the Paris Climate Agreement. I hope we won't have the same result as the painting 'The Garden of Earthly Delights,' featured in the beginning of the movie."
" Impressive movie about the climate change and its effects
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,10,"It is an excellent movie for everybody because we all have to care about the human-made effects of climate change. This movie euphemizes nothing. They talk frankly about rational arguments and solutions against climate change, what we can do personally and what our nations should do. I would recommend this movie to everybody, but especially to my (English) teachers because they have the chance to show this movie to groups of young persons who definitely have to think more about the horrible effects of climate change and global warming. In my opinion, the most impressive person in this movie is the CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk, because he showed us a manageable solution against climate change. For me, there is a difference between hearing about solutions which can, in fact, help and which we should do as opposed to theoretical solutions. Musk gave a clear solution."
" ""You created the problem, we will create it in the future""
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,10,"Before the Flood is a documentary our young generation must see. The movie starring Leonardo Dicaprio who travels to different places around the world. He gets to see how global warming has changed our earth. If we don't change our lifestyles today, it's not sure if our upcoming generations will survive on this earth. Sunita Narain, the minister of Environment in India, said that 300 million Indians live without electricity. To create better lives for everyone, every single country needs to participate to change their energy sources to stop the global warming, she said. We can't just think about today, we have to start to think about what could happen tomorrow. What changes we all can do to create a better world for all of us."
" great movie and Barak Obama's role is incredible
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,10,"The movie is about how we are currently treating our planet and the issues facing it now - and it is time for real solutions in order to protect our planet for ourselves and the coming generations. I definitely recommend everyone to watch it, because the movie elaborates very well the situation. After watching it, I think we cannot say that we do not know about the problem or even deny the real danger for our lives. It was important to know that every one of us is able to do something to solve the problem, as well. For example, we can change our lifestyles. In my view, Barak Obama's role was very incredible because he was the first president of the US who wanted to do something to solve the problem. Many politicians have spoken about that issue before, but nobody wanted to take a real action. We need new laws for our common purpose."
" know the present state of the earth. the earth is exposed to a crisis
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,9,"i like it.because it inform me that we have to turn our eyes more about global warming. And i'd like to recommend many people watching this. i think Indian women was the most interesting.she said that who rescues a developing nation. when i heard that, i think i should turn my attention to the a lot of counties. i wanna watch again."
" before the flood
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,10,"In this documentary, Leonardo Dicaprio shows what is the reality of the world and all the secondary effects the world suffers from the the bad things the human race does every day. The idea of this documentary is to create conscience now, think about our future before the flood. I really liked the documentary. There was a lot of important information and excellent production. Before the flood has something special, a real history told by famous characters who shows us "" the other side of the coin"", we can perceive the real compromise he has in this theme.Throughout the documentary, he meets a lot of important persons who have specific and special opinions about global warming, but for me, the most interesting professional was the astronaut. He has all the information about the world and the earth, including the effects in all the areas. He and his group of experts can predict the future if the human race continue their bad habits with the real treasure: The earth."
" Stop global worming. And let as know global worming's danger.
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,10,"I like this video because I know that I don't know. It's good to clarify the dangers of global warming from various aspects. So I want to recommend everyone. You get new knowledge about global worming and you will notice the danger. I think the most interesting person is president of the US Obama. They have a big power to move the world. As the US moves,the whole world moves.So I think the US is responsible for moving the world in a good direction.This is good movie."
" The Power Of The Global Warming
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,9,"The movie explains how Leonardo Dicaprio tries to change the opinions around the world about the environment and what we can do to fix this BIG PROBLEM.I like this, because, this teaches us how we can care for the environment and how we can tell the world whats happening in this momentI recommend this movie 100% for sure.The most interesting person in the movie was Elon Musk(CEO of Tesla) Because he tells us how we can give solar energy to the ENTIRE WORLD and the thing we need is a GigaFactory with natural resources."
" Movie about the environment and Global Warming
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,9,"Leonardo Di Caprio travels the world and meets scientists and leaders of countries and firms. With these leaders, he speaks about pollution, global warming, and solutions. Leonardo Di Caprio travels the worlds and visited beautiful places like India, Alaska, North Pole, Arctic, Indonesia, Argentina... but most of these places was spoilt by human passage> I like this movie because it helps to become aware of the current problem. In addition, it is well rotated and easily comprehensible. I recommended it if you're interested in global warming or if you don't know what global warming is. The Indian woman was the most interesting because she speaks well: poor people can't change to reusable energy, so when Americans people change to the wind, solar and water power, many Indian people will change to oil power. So this change is not sufficient."
" Before the flood
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,8,"1. The movie is a documentary by Leonardo Di Caprio about pollution in the world. 2.Leonardo Di Caprio travels for around the worlds: India, Miami, Washington , Alaska, New York, China, Beijing, Canada, Roma where he interview different persons: Pope Francis, Obama, Papa, Indian Woman etc.I Like this documentary because i think that is very important to save our planet, everyday the pollution is higher and soon everything will disappear but we put a stop. I would recommend this video to everyone to see the reality and help stop the pollution.i think that the most important person in this documentary is Leonardo Di Caprio because he took some time to investigate about the pollution."

",2017-08-17 00:00:00,8,"1) -the movies is about the protection of the environment.-the movies shows the destruction of the planet and tries to make people aware to try to change this situation.2) Yes, it's a really good film because show the situation about the planet and in the film Leonardo DiCaprio talk about important people with great influence and who can change this situation.3) Yes, everybody should see this movie to be aware and change yours bad habits to protect the environment.4)For me the most interesting person in the movie is Elon Musk (CEO Tesla) because he's so intelligent and he have good ideas to save and protect the environment."
" This movie is interesting because, of it is content. The actor's playing is also very good and plesure.
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,10,"2. Yes I liked that movie, because of iknd and it is content and Leo's play. 3. Of course i recommend this movie. This film is interesting of it's view of nature, we see whole over the world. 4. The most excited person in that movie, is Elon Musk the CEO of Tesla. Elon Musk have a view of the future about the machines. He cares about human efficiency, so that is why i liked and i almost agree with that opinion."
" We can fix the problem that we made, or let the world ends.
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,9,"I like this movie, because it tells us what problem of the world is. And show us each city's problem. I don't remember every details of the movie, but I will always remember a woman said her country will follow what America did, if other big countries don't help them. I think the world belong to all of human in the world. And everyone has responsibility to protect it. However, I think the most interesting person is the woman too. Because she didn't cover what she said, she told everything to the camera."
" my summary for the movie
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,10,"the summary. the humans are destroying the world and the environment but there's still hope in humanity. I liked the movie because it shows a problem that's in the world and a lot of people they don't know about it. I highly recommend watching the movie. the most interesting person was the Indian scientist, because when she was talking about the problem she was passionate about it and really want to solve the problem."
" its about global warming
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,10,"I think the movie(documentary) is good because the goal is to introduce you to global warming in a way you will be interested about it. It's a big problem and the majority of people don't care about it. So, for that reason I recommend that movie.Something i thought was interesting was when Pope Francis said: ""I agree with the science as long about global warming"" because I think he is the most important person in all the world so if he says something, I believe all the world will be influenced by that."
" global warming
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,10,"well I think it is a really good movie. I recommend it because this movie represents all the global warming-related problems around the world and talks about problems in real life.Leonardo Dicaprio was the protagonist in this movie and he talks with many important and famous people who know about the problem of global warming. He talks with Pope Francis, ex-president Barack Obama and any more. Leornardo Dicaprio looks for a solution and how to avoid the Global warming and demonstrates to the world that it is a big problem."
" impact,destroy
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,10,"I recommend this documentary because you can look at the problem from perspectives all around the world and the people featured make you aware of global warming. It is important that you know about what happens in our future right now because we have to know how to build the future the way we want? Jason box was interesting in this movie because he talks about the problem where is more reflected the global warming with the iceberg and the snow.He knows too much. Another interesting part is when you see Leo Dicaprio because you see the situation from his and others' points of view. There are many unpopular movies about global warming but this is not one of them. You will change your mind and you will see for yourself how to take care of your habits, as well as the people who hang around me."
" the global warming is real
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,9,"this movie makes you see what happens to the earth. This movie tells you how dangerous the situation is on the planet. Also the movie gives us many solutions to help the planet and stop global warming. I was attracted by the Indian women, who said the poor countries can't do anything because they don't have money. I recommend you see the movie as it will open your eyes to what is happening to our planet."
" We have to think seriously about our earth. There are many people who worry about environment.
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,7,"I agree with Obama's opinion. If the people who live near the ocean, move and use scarce resources, the environment will get worse and worse. So, I think it is important to know how to live without a lot of scarce resources and how to support those people. The environment itself doesn't have a problem, but the human action negatively affects the environment. The deterioration of it can't be restored, so it's necessary to stop further destruction.I recommend this movie because it is a good opportunity to know about the environment. If you don't know much about that, you should watch this movie. You can see many problems related to global warming."
" It lead you to realize you should think about global warming seriously.
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,8,"Before I watched it, I didn't know about details regarding what happened in the world because of global warming. If you want to know, I recommend you watch this documentary. You can see real world issues. According to Obama, global warming will cause civil wars or fights between communities and people protecting their resources and places in the future. If we do not care about global warming, it could go downhill. We have to care about it to protect not only earth but also ourselves"
" Before the Flood
",2017-06-08 00:00:00,8,"Global warming is an important issue for the people who live on the earth. When I was young, I saw this problem in magazines and on TV programs. But until I watched this movie, I hadn't realized the severity of the problem.In this documentary movie, Leonardo DiCaprio, who is United Nations ambassador of piece, uses his experience and opinion to describe what Global warming is. And because he is not an expert, he actually consults other professional people. After that, he leads us to many places to know how bad our planet earth. First of all, he goes to the Arctic, and understands the Arctic is like the air conditioning for the northern hemisphere. If it goes away, it will make floods and droughts more catastrophic. What's more, they show that some politicians deny the impact of climate change because of the profit of fossil fuels. However, he still visits other countries to find some solutions. To be honest, these are the most impressive things to me. According to the movie, it summarizes many ways to decrease global warming issue, such as using the wind and solar to replace coals, changing your diet to help the environment, or putting a tax on the carbon tax, etc.Basically, the world needs to accept the science of climate change. There is also a bunch of things we don't know and need to participate. That's the reason I suggest you should watch this movie. I am sure you can learn and get something from this movie."
" ""Before the Flood""
",2017-06-08 00:00:00,10,"""Before the Flood"" is a documentary where Leonardo DiCaprio travels to different cities to show the effects of the global warning. In addition, to show how we have been destroying the earth for many years. Also you can see the hard effects of pollution and the causes of contamination. After that, you can feel motivated and think of more ways to save the earth.In my opinion, this documentary is amazing and it tries to makes aware of taking care of the earth. I think this documentary should be seen by everyone because this topic is important in these days. The person who I want to highlight is Leonardo DiCaprio because he really loves to be part of the change, whereas other actors spend their time in other vain things instead he focuses on discuss the effects of the contamination and manages the theme."
" Unbalanced (critical analyzed)
",2017-06-08 00:00:00,4,"The movie ""Before the Flood"" shows the situation about the global warming from a viewpoint of a few American democrats. To become a bigger audience, they engage Leonardo DiCaprio (of course, he is a UN-climate change ambassador, which is a good marketing step as well) as the main person and to appear more credible. They interviewed some trustworthy people like the Pope or some environment scientists, who have the same political attitude. Leonardo DiCaprio shows a few spots on earth, for example, a melting glacier.The problem of this movie is he shows really just one of the perspectives of the situation. Anyone who is watching the movie, without any critical scrutiny, believes that the earth is going to die. Of course, we should stop the pollution and we should treat our planet with respect, but the movie is too unbalanced. Why I should believe in somebody who is talking about the climate change, but at the same time he is driving a SUV and is going by helicopter to a glacier, or is traveling (I guess by first class) around the world for an interview. Also the movie showed us that Leonardo DiCaprio and the director of the movie ""The Revenant"" had moved the entire production to another location. Clearly, this needs a lot of energy just for a good picture in the movie. It is like preaching water while drinking wine itself"
" Before the flood
",2017-06-08 00:00:00,8,"Leonardo DiCaprio meets with scientists, world leaders and discusses the dangers of climate change and possible solutions, so he starts to explore and answer multiple questions around it.I do recommend the movie because climate change is happening and it's a fact.That's why the movie gives us a really important message - everyone should take care of the environment starting with little steps. The movie tries to tell us what we must do to prevent the worst outcome in the world and what's going to happen if we don't do anything to fix it. Therefore, I think that's an educational documentary that helps us to understand that climate change is real and for that reason, I think that everyone should watch it.Barack Obama was the person in the movie that makes me have a really good impression because he is an influential person and in the documentary, he is interviewed and he shows his worry about the climate change and emphasizes that we must be conscious of the problem that we are living and we must control what we do next, because our future will be affected by this problem."
" Before the flood
",2017-06-08 00:00:00,7,"A simple man, Leonardo Dicaprio, on his journey to get informed about climate change. Multiple scientists come and answer multiple questions, all depending on their expertise. Some messages of hope, others of despair and some just showing the truth of their own countries in the last few years. I do recommend this movie for a semi-mature audience. Basically, do not watch it with your five year old because it is quite graphic and alarming, as it should be, but a little too much for kids. I think everybody else should watch this movie because it is not too scientific, just a little bit, but it talks more about the link climate change has with the future of humanity and the political statements surrounding it, it is not all numbers and statistics. Some American politicians mentioned in this movie are totally discouraging. People like the Governor of Florida and the current president of the United States, for example, are shown as people that think that such a thing as climate change does not exist... They completely deny it! Of course, their actions follow. We also learn that about a third of the senate is filled with such people, which do not believe in such a thing as climate change."
" ""Before the flood""
",2017-06-08 00:00:00,10,"""Before the flood"" is talking about the climate changes and the impact that humans have done to the earth. The film makes an emphasis on what we have to do in the future to slow the changes down, especially with the Paris climate conference.Personally, I think every human being on the planet should watch this movie because basically everybody is involved in this issue and has to take a part of the solution. The whole the scientific community shows clearly with research and numbers to back it up that the changes have already begun, and that we can't change back but only lower the human impact to preserve what will seem to be a different world for our children. The Pope was interviewed in the movie and I was surprised that he agrees with the scientific community. We all know that science and religion have not the same vision, in my opinion, I think that the Pope agrees that climate change exists, and not for the best, is a big step forward. He is a spiritual leader and inspires a lot of people in the world. He takes a step to the science and I think that will put people in front of this human problem and certainly make them responsible."
" Before The Flood
",2017-06-08 00:00:00,9,"Let Leonardo DiCaprio take you on a journey around the world about recent global problems, politicians dealing with it and a variety of personal opinions about these devastating problems. Seeing familiar faces makes this documentary movie enjoyable to watch. Overall this movie is really heavy and even though you already know about these problems, getting into it again, makes you really reconsider your own lifestyle.Who should watch it and who shouldn't? Easy answer. If you care about the environment already, watch it and I am sure that you will recommend it to even other people. If you don't know anything about it or you never really thought about it then feel free to watch. If you don't like this genre of movie, the subject is not your type of thing or you think that global warming is garbage then please don't watch it. Maybe it could change your mind but only if you let the movie. Generally, I really recommend this movie but only because I liked it, doesn't mean you will as well.The person I really would want to meet is Leonardo himself. I would love to discuss this subject with him. I love, how he really committed himself to the earth and you can see how he loves the earth and he wants it to be clean and safe again.9 out of 10 is appropriate I think despite of it's length, acting and importance. The only thing that I have to complain about this movie is that sometimes it's based on a personal opinion. I like it of course but not everyone will."
" global warming
",2017-06-07 00:00:00,6,"I think this movie has nothing different from the other movies about global warming. But there are a couple famous people, this is the only difference. There are Leonardo Dicaprio and President Obama. They are very famous and obviously great people, so it can make a feeling that global warming isn't far away from us and thinking the global warming is a good thing or can be the way to becoming a good person. Therefore this movie is a little better than the other movies at some points.In my opinion, it is easy to say that global warning should be stopped, but taking some actions to stop global warming is too difficult. And I think this movie is in this situation. Just say, but do nothing. So I want this movie to have a helpful action for the environment. It is not a discussion. Like, try to live without the electric stuff. However, here are good points. An advantage of this movie is that they get a real video about the effect of the global warming. Like, raising the sea level, melting the glacier, destroying the environment, and warming point on the earth on the monitor. So I recommend it to people who don't know the global warming. But people who used to discuss a problem about global warming shouldn't see it, it is probably boring. In conclusion, this movie's good points are to know that Leonardo Dicaprio has an opinion about global warming and there are real videos that effect it."
" shoking
",2017-06-07 00:00:00,7,"This movie is about crisis caused by human actions. It urges us to take action to save the earth, or we will lose our future. One of the current issues is political corruptions. Politicians are reluctant to care about global warming because of money from companies.Therefore, what should I do is to vote for politicians who will fight for global warming. I think people all over the world should watch this movie and think about others.Don't be selfish. In my opinion, USA should support agreement which needs the cooperation of all countries, I won't agree to Trump's option."
" Global warming, not a tale
",2017-06-07 00:00:00,9,"The movie speaks about one of the most important problem which we have to live together for the rest of our lives, ""Climate change"". We will take a trip with Leonardo Dicaprio around the world to see with our own eyes the impact the climate changes produces on the biosphere.It is a movie that everyone has to see because is not just another normal documentary. In this one, the narrator of the movie is a famous person that everybody knows, so that makes the movie closer to you. This is not the type of movie which helps you to sleep.Apart from the main theme, which is very important, in my opinion, what makes this movie very important are all the people that Leonardo interviews. Obama, the last president of the United States of America, and even the Pope appear here. That show us that not just the scientists are worried about the climate change, and it is a problem that all of us have to fight together against. And Leonardo speaks about an important problem that is acting in every government. The corruption between the politicians and the big gas/oil companies which makes it difficult to find solutions.My rating of the movie is an 8 over 10. Thanks of Leonardo, with this movie, more people will be conscience about the problem that we have in front of our doors."
" Face the climate change directly
",2017-06-07 00:00:00,10,"Highly recommended! The film is telling people what we have done to the environment, the impact of the activities and what we could do to save the planet.Watching the film, you will have an inside view of climate change by realizing the effects relating to everything we do/have done. As scientist Gidon mentioned in an interview with DiCaprio, beef is one of the most inefficient uses of resources on the planet. 70% of the land in U.S. is just to grow feed for cattle. Most importantly, cows produce methane, which is a powerful greenhouse gas. Compared to signing petitions or joining demonstrations, maybe the easiest way to support the environment is to change your diet, which means less beef or choosing chicken as an alternative."
" awesome documentary movie
",2017-06-07 00:00:00,7,"This movie is a powerful documentary. Leonardo Di Caprio took a journey to many countries in order to research how climate change is actually going on and interview scientists and politicians who work on that. You should feel like you have to take an action anyway after watching this movie. In fact, I know climate change is a serious problem but I didn't really care about that before. However, I was shocked by the reality all over the world, which made me feel like I have to do something for that. Therefore, I want you all to watch this movie. Each person should realize what we have been facing from this movie. I think Leonardo Di Caprio did a great job and that such a famous actor works on this problem would give a big effect on people all over the world."
" a climate change movie, one time again
",2017-06-07 00:00:00,6,"First, for me, it's a good movie, but it is still a movie about climate change. It shows us how the world grew up and how the evolution is devolution. But the skeptic in me says that nothing is going to change by one more movie, and what Trump says confirm my opinion: ""Global warming? but it's cold outside, we need global warming !""Yes, there is the Pope in it, but what difference is going to really make?For curious people who don't really know the subject, it's a really good movie to see, but if you are a bit aware of climate change, you won't learn anything.But, to see Obama in this movie it makes me feels a bit better for the future, and I hope he will inspire the next generation to change. It's not the government's work to change, it's up to us to make the right choice, by our consumption, our vision of the world, and our vote."
" Excellent
",2017-05-18 00:00:00,10,"I have never seen an environmental documentary movie. In my opinion, it is the most persuasive movie in the world because the entire cast are super celebrities and they talked about the serious future of the whole world.If many people don't know about global warming, they should watch it because many celebrities appeared in the movie. When President Obama was in the movie, he was still president of America, so he could use good knowledge about global warming to influence the world.Finally, I recommend this movie to the advanced country leaders. They should watch it because developing country leaders can't lead their citizens on this issue due to poverty. These leaders focus on the lack of finance but advanced leaders can support them."
" My opinion about ''Before the flood''
",2017-05-18 00:00:00,10,"This film was speaking about global warming. The problem now and the future. In summary, if everyone and the governments of all countries don't do anything we will go directly into a wall.All countries leaders should watch this film to educate them because they need to change and show us the good way. They really can reduce the problem, if we do something but the government doesn't follow us we can't do anything.Florida's governor Rubio is a good example of a bad opinion about global warming. Florida is directly touched by global warming so they need a governor who help the state solve this problem. Florida needs a conscientious person in regards to global warming.I give this movie 8/10, because it's important to teach people about this problem. There are a lot of images that show the problem and that's good. I think a lot of people should watch this movie."
" before the flood
",2017-05-18 00:00:00,7,"the film talking about change the weather and all world should care about it we saw in the film a lot of celebrate like Obama and pop Francis and DiCaprio is the main actor in the documentary and all that because this subject is important and in the future it will happen lot of problems and we should find the solution before the problems happen,it is a good documentary for watch"
" This could have some SPOILERS about he movie
",2017-05-18 00:00:00,10,"Global warming is a fact. And this documentary is trying to send the message all around the world - and that's gonna happen - that's what I feel. But, what is the message of this movie? After having seen the movie, I conclude the owners of big fossil fuel and oil companies should watch this documentary. Why? Because this movie shows clear arguments and real evidence that these companies are manipulating the politics only for money. In the film, Leonardo talks to Obama, who, interestingly says that global warming is a national security issue that in the future would create less land, more people coming from the coast to the city, less resources... Basically the big problem is that a hunger civil war is gonna happen. The documentary is trying to warn us that if we don't try to do something now, we will live in a devastated planet, but, the message is that we have time to solve it and it is all in our hands, together. I fully recommend it."
" .
",2017-05-18 00:00:00,10,"It's necessary to watch this movie, because it makes references at what is happening at this moment around the world. We have the opportunity to change our bad habits right now and that's why this movie was made. We need to have a conscience and act immediately, because we aren't the people who will be suffering the consequences. It depends on us to change the future of the earth. Leonardo DiCaprio has an important role in this film, as a famous person he has kind of an influence on all his fans - therefore, all the work and worries he puts into it might reach a lot of people."
" Contains everything related to Climate change issue
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,10,One of the best documentaries I have ever watched. It contains every answer related to the question of Climate change. Is it a myth or real issue? What are the causes of it?? What are its effects? What are Motives of certain companies?? What are its Solutions?? The answers of all these question is rationally explained through scientific data and and by visiting the most affected places of the world. A must watch documentary for everyone who cares for this planet.
" We have to notice climate change!
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,8,"This movie follows Leonardo DiCaprio as he travels the world to talk with people who have the power to do something about climate change and examine the effects of climate change.There are many things that climate change affects. Sea levels are rising, we are losing biodiversity, forest are decreasing and ice is melting. Before the Flood shows us real and scary climate change and also how we should stop it. This movie is produced by Leonardo DiCaprio but he doesn't have a background in environment and science. However, I felt that he is the right man to address and examine these problems. There are other movies on this topic, but these usually use overly academic content and are produced by scientists which means these are difficult to understand and we feel like it's unrealistic. On the other hand, in this movie we feel more familiar than other movies because Leonardo also doesn't have academic knowledge. Finally, this movie urges us to consider climate change, just like Leonardo.Gregory N. Mankiw, professor of Economics at Harvard University, mentioned a carbon tax, which is a type of tax that applies when you emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. I was impressed this option, because there is a precedent which is for cigarettes. In Japan consumption of cigarettes is decreasing since the government put a tax on cigarettes. As he said in the movie, to put tax on carbon is really difficult. There are two reasons. First, we have to always think about carbon despite having many things to do. Second, there are a lot of politicians who are lobbied by oil, gas and energy companies. They don't want a carbon tax, because it's a disadvantage to them. However, like gay marriage, if American people are convinced, politicians have to do it. In Japan, we introduced new tax in 2012 which put tax on every fossil fuel. However, the tax rate is lower than other countries which introduced new taxes so it's not obvious whether the new tax is efficient or not, but some countries have a result of reducing carbon footprint due to the carbon tax. I think the carbon tax is as good as any options. I didn't know that climate change has been happening all over the world before we saw this movie. Some problems are familiar to me especially about diet which concerns meat and palm oil. First, I thought only myself changing is a tiny thing. But this movie shows me that this is the only way to improve climate change, because politicians don't support change by themselves. I can't know completely how much changing our diet will affect climate change, but trying step by step is important. So I will be concerned about my diet as much as possible.I noticed that we should try to change by our self in order to improve climate change. However, the people who don't know about these problems are difficult to convince. But, first of all, we have to notice that climate change is continuing dramatically. If we notice more, I think this movement will get bigger and eventually improve climate change. We have to make politicians and the president focus on climate change more and more."
" Avoids an inconvenient topic
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,7,"The movie does present the issue and some solutions but avoids to mention the main cause: overpopulation. All the climate change problems originate from one thing: too many people.Decreasing the population quickly would be the only way to solve this on the long run. A generation or two should sacrifice itself and agree a one-child policy. It is an emotionally sensitive topic, yes. It will be though for the economy, yes. But no technological advancement will help if we keep up the current growth rate.What the movie pictures the best is the selfishness of various groups and individuals and the inability to work together. Maybe the main moral of the story is that people are selfish and short-sighted by nature and climate change is an unavoidable consequence."
" Definitely one of the most important movies of the year (arguably the most important)!
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,9,"'BEFORE THE FLOOD': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new documentary about climate change; co-produced by, and starring, Leonardo DiCaprio. It was also co-produced by, and directed by, actor (turned filmmaker) Fisher Stevens; and Martin Scorsese served as an executive producer on the film. It was written by Mark Monroe; who's also written multiple other critically acclaimed documentaries (many also dealing with climate change), like 2009's 'THE COVE' and 2012's 'CHASING ICE'. The movie revolves around DiCaprio traveling the world, while he investigates the impact of global warming (in each location). It was released by National Geographic (for free), and it's received mostly positive reviews from critics and fans alike. I think it's a well made, and very important film. The movie took three years to make, and it also (briefly) documents some of the production of 'THE REVENANT'; which DiCaprio was also filming (partially at the same time). DiCaprio and Stevens traveled all over the globe, documenting the most powerful impacts of climate change (wherever they went). Along the way DiCaprio interviews many important political figures, including President Barack Obama and Pope Francis (just to name a few). He also repeatedly uses a 15th- century triptych, by Hieronymus Bosch (called 'The Garden of Earthly Delights'), as an analogy to compare where he thinks the world is currently headed. The movie is also accompanied by a haunting score; written and performed by Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross, Mogwai and Gustavo Santaolalla. The film is definitely one of the most important movies of the year (arguably the most important); it's extremely informative and well made. DiCaprio is a little too stiff though, to provide much entertainment value. I hate to say that too, because I really respect him; as an actor and a person (and he's definitely got a lot of passion). Despite the film lacking in this area, it's still a great movie though. It does argue the importance of dietary change; which a lesser film wouldn't have had the courage to do, so I really respect it for that (even though it could have expressed the importance of veganism even more). Despite some minor flaws, it is undoubtedly a well made (and extremely important) documentary, that everyone needs to see!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M9osPwjfbM"
