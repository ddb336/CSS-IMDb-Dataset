" Great movie, great story
",2021-04-05 00:00:00,10,"The story is so nice. It looks cool, rough and gangsta. But underneath there is also a beautiful story. A child that grows up with different paths to walk. Men I love this movie. After a view days I'm still saying... ""Go sleepy weepy""!;-)"
" Low Tier Sci-Fi
",2021-04-02 00:00:00,4,"A rather brainless movie, bad and boring plot, and some silly acting by some random goth singers - no offence, I find it cringe when people get roles just for being a little famous."
" Mad nix
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,4,A bad remake of Mad max 2. Good picture but bad storyline.
" Crime lesson
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,6,"In a dystopic reality, an unconventional gang give to a new born robot tragicomic crime lessons, sadly showing how easy is to manipulate a pristine conscience. Maybe too much ammos to realize too soon who the too obvious enemy is...."
" Dud
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,3,This is a boring movie. I had to keep nudging myself to stay awake for the duration.The characters are clichés and so is the giant talking toaster.Not worth it.
" Very cool
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,7,"Crappie is not the best sci-fi film ever made, and it doesn't need to be. This movie is really cool."
" A solid watch for anyone ignore really bad reviews
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,6,"I am really surprised about the reviews on this film, I have watched it twice with my wife and we consider ourselves film buffs you come to for recommendations. The charming cuteness of chappie has you laughing and felling for the robot. The casting was majorly ok, but agree with others dieantwood was not the best casting, ninja was poor but yolandy was stronger. Overall this film has some good action and heartfelt moments and just a solid Friday night watch."
" Underrated movie
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,9,"This is probably the best movie I have seen this last decade. The story is interesting and nicely paced, the special effects are unbelievably realistic and the characters bring a unique story to life through their amazing performances. Chappie is portrayed by Sharlto Copley who absolutely hit the nail on the head as always. Dev Patel portrays Devon Wilson, who is an interesting secondary main character. The addition of Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman upped the ante up even more, as these are amazing actors as well. The rap dup was a mixed bag for a lot of people, which is somewhat understandable, but I think they served their purpose in the movie and that their performances worked out in the movie's favor. By the end of the movie I got pretty attached to Chappie as a character, and I hope that Chappie makes a return one day. I want you to ignore the bad reviews, check the movie out for yourself and make your own review afterwards. You will most likely not be disappointed."
" A super awesome film!
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,10,"Love this film.
Yes it has it's faults and plot holes.But this is one of the few rare films with so much heart and appeal that I can watch it over and over and still smile.Awesome visuals, interesting characters, smashing soundtrack, well acted ...I could go on and on.And yeah.... Sigourney Weaver! <3"
" they should have a made a sequel
",2020-12-28 00:00:00,8,Really dont know why it didnt get a sequel it was a great movie 6.8 on imdb is outstanding... dissapointing that such a great movie didnt get a sequel
" Certainly better than I thought it would be
",2020-12-28 00:00:00,7,"So let's start with the obvious. I like Die Antwoord. Their music is different, I like raving to it after a long day of hearing ""Muzak"" at work, but damn why did they have to be such a central feature to the film? It's jarring and gets old after a while. I wish they had played characters rather than dystopian versions of their stage personas. Plus if you are gonna plaster their music all over the place at least play I Fink U Freeky (unless I missed it). On to the rest of the review.Chappie asks a lot do big questions in the first half of the film, and they make for an interesting narrative. A chattel industry of robots being used to aid in the shutdown of crime in Johannesburg. They could have sparked some debate about police militarization but I doubt they were thinking about this in 2015. The other big question is that can we trust an artificial intelligence to determine ""morality"" and ""objectivity"" in a police capacity better than humans? The film firmly says no, for it is easily made clear that ""human intelligence"" is rife with bad ethics and morality. Talk about unintentionally being ahead of the curve on that one.We touched on some other parts such as media overexposure, deification and crime, but it got quickly lost as the movie started rushing through a lot of these subplots. Juggling is a hard sport, and possibly simplifying the script would have aided in a smoother narrative. For example, as great as Hugh Jackman was, he could have been removed and the whole ""Moose"" subplot would have been just a tale of an expensive experiment on the back burner rather than jealousy fueled one-upmanship. It would have been cool if it had been mentioned but we never saw the Moose until it was unleashed. A lot of things could have been done but perhaps adding some more time to the movie to allow for better deconstruction of these themes would have helped.Chappie is a pretty well made movie both stylistically and plot wise. With some generic turns that didn't make much sense it still had a decent narrative. The robot effects are especially great and I loved the callbacks to the original Robocop in regards to the robot voices and the Moose.I certainly enjoy Blomkamp's type of sci-fi but he tends to leave the wrong answers as the ending, much like with Elysium. Interesting stuff to think about though."
" If you like dystopian future movies, this is for you.
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,6,"The crude, ugliness of the first half of the movie was too much for me. It goes to the extreme of ugliness, but I know some people who would love that. But what is amazing to me is by the end of the movie you start to feel for these vulgar people. Even the father who is a louse shows his good side at the end. I do not admire nor respect the characters in this movie, but it shows how what you think and see could have some redeeming values. Some can learn, some can improve, some can change. But the change is implied and will not be proven unless there is a Chappie II. I dont know if I want to find out since the values in this movie are so questionable. Yet, there is hope.
As much as I know Hugh Jackman's voice is not what it is in the Marvel movies, if this is his voice, I understand why they had him change it. He does not come across as powerful in this movie especially with the phrase ""Tits up,"" which made me laugh. I think the movie idea was good. I dont think they hit the mark with it due to the vulgarity and poor values, but they certainly improved the last 1/3 of the movie. It is the first time I've seen a good idea, not executed well, actually improve toward the last part of the movie. In that respect it was very refreshing. To be honest, I do look forward to a Chappie II"
" One of the better movies
",2020-12-02 00:00:00,10,This is one of the better movies since a long time. The story and deeper meaning area good combination for some fun and down to earth thinking.
" Criticus who gave it a 9 ? Seriously ?
",2020-11-12 00:00:00,4,"I thought where i started this movie, Maybe it is good, Hugh Jackman, Sigourney Weaver , both made some seriously good movies!
This isn't one of them! Acting isn't that good, it feels like it was filmed with an iPhone.
Storyline, over acting, it's bad.
Some critics want a sequel? Seriously get another job!
It's not a good movie, pass this one.."
" Chappie? Kinda crappie...
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,5,"As if Hollywood wasn' t struggling enough, scrambling around the joint trying desperately to find new and original material to give their audiences. Here, they regurgitate the tired old 'robot/android' theme, and, like the hungry baby bird, we are supposed to gobble it down. And on top of this, there, off in the distance, is that snow-covered peak of a mediocrity Andersen Cooper offereed up to us 'as Himself', and we are supposed to imagine that such a bland and tepid tasting turnip soup of a man would be believable as anything, anything at all...no, I say. No. This entire pot of soup should be dumped down the drain. Instead, 're-imagine' this movie, and 'defund' the old one."
" ""to Robocop was District 9 was to independence day...""
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,7,"I've been a big fan of Blomkamp since District 9. Or rather I've been a fan of District 9 but hadn't really thought to look out for more recent movies till recently. Another one was made in the mean time. Anyway. Chappie is to Robocop was District 9 was to independence day... Kind of a similar topic, made through an entirely different lens. Complex. Android cops manufactured by an evil-capitalist corporation. But Blomkamp' vision brings the topic of an entirely artificial conscience and what it would mean to consider the rights of such beings, in a backdrop of gangsta style crime and not so petty thieves with heavy weaponry. It's still an action movie even though it gives a lot to reflect on."
" The Most Over-loathed Movie By Critics for No Reason
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,8,"When this came out I never heard a peep about it except for it was a bad AI film and I decided to check out this so called poor take on machines the same year it released. I agree the characters are kind of generic and aren't built up but the CGI man! That was good. The cinematography made this movie feel like South Africa every frame has a purpose a feel to it I can't explain, the ending was a shock for me and made no sense but I still loved it either way. Chappie had many comedic moments and the kind of dialogue I expected from Dev Patel and Hugh Jackman who delivered. The action was bada**, I don't want to get into spoilers but I will say this movie deals with the human consciousness. It doesn't have the best plot you'll ever see but it's manageable. It is still among the best among robot, action, sci-fi movies definitely check it out if your into that. If you don't like one of those genres (except action there's not a lot of it), then stay away."
" Scifi with ...
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,3,"Well the movie is all over the place, it had no meaning in the end. I didnt feel anything for the characters in the movie , all of them was very not likeable. So it didnt work for me at all !! The good parts was with the robot acting scared like a kid and did stupid stuff!! But after all was done, with special effects and things blowing up and the director has shown his skill. It leaves a movie that made me dazed and konfused in a bad way!"
" ANOTHER blomkamp masterpiece!! Simply phenomenal!!
",2020-10-05 00:00:00,10,"Have no idea why this movie didn't do extremely well at the box office and get a sequel, it seems only garbage like id4 or Wayne's world get sequels. This movie would have found a base, it has it all action, emotion, revenge, villains, scifi. Friendship,loss,what more do you fricking need!! Distruct 9, elysium, and this masterpiece show blomkamp is a genius who needs to keep making his art!!!!"
" Don't leave us hanging like this Neil...
",2020-10-02 00:00:00,10,This cult classic needs a sequel. The negative press was obviously written by close minded fools.
" Columbus' egg
",2020-10-02 00:00:00,8,"If I could write such an interesting script, I'd be very happy to be a screenwriter. In the beginning it looked like a computer programmer was the main character and then gradually the robot became the main character. I thought the transition was brilliant and the process was very interesting. The robot is the protagonist, so it's hard to make the character, but it was really well written and realistic. Furthermore, not only the main character but also the supporting characters were well written. The way the balance between their good and bad attitudes was well drawn. This made the drama of the climax even more exciting. Since the robot is the main character, the casting was well controlled so that the other supporting characters would not spoil the main characters.
Movie scripts basically show what the main character has to do early on. But this script is not like that. We don't know where the protagonists are going until the middle of the story. Still, I enjoyed watching the process, each episode, because it was interesting. It would be good for the scriptwriter to realize how important it is to have interesting episodes.
If I had to say a drawback, I think it's possible for a robot of this type to change batteries or recharge its batteries. It was also hard to understand why they couldn't save their consciousness as data. But I didn't care much about the details because the whole story was well-drawn.
The director seems to be the type of person who spends a lot of time on the script. I hope he'll take his time to make another interesting film."
" Amazing
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,10,It is a great movie. I watched it 3 times so far. What's that with all negative reviews? Highly recommended.
" 2 more years for the script missed
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,4,"The movie is all over the place. Some moments are so confused that all you can do is just watch and stop thinking, because if you do, you would not be able to make a coherent story.Why? Because the movie was rushed and the script was far from ready. It is as if it was written off the top of the head with one main idea and some additional cast and scenes that all together do not have too much sense.The point of the movie is, what? It is not a parable it is not hyperbole... what is it then? What is this robot exactly? Most of the movie he is confused, as much as I am while watching it.Next time, just sit down and connect all dots to the last detail. Without a script this is the exact result with all CGI perfectly done. Nope, it does not help because it does not work."
" Excellent
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,10,"Wish they made a part 2. I love ChappieGritty, funny, good soundtrack,
Creative, and has a deeper meaning."
" One of the worst robot movies ever
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,3,This is the worst film ever done by Jackman and Waver and Patel.
" ""Short Circuit"" meets ""IRobot""
",2020-07-23 00:00:00,6,"Dev Patel (""Deon"") is the computer programmer/designer of some state of the art police robots in crime-ridden Johannesburg. His heavily arnoured ""scouts"" manage to drastically reduce the crime rate but he want to develop them further - a plan not supported by his boss Sigourney Weaver so he decides to take things into is own hands. When one of his creations gets hit and damaged by an RPG, he pinches it intent on giving it some humanity. Snag is, he gets kidnapped by a bunch of low-lives who want him to turn the rogue robot ""Chappie"" into a criminal to help them carry out a heist to raise the money they need to repay a local crime lord. Meantime, Hugh Jackman has also developed a super robot that is sitting idle because of the effectiveness of the more benign scouts. When ""Chappie"" starts stealing things, he gets to release his monster robot and, well you can guess the rest. It's one of those films that trades very much on the quality of the cast, but is let down by really mediocre writing and directing and again, Weaver, turns up in a charm-free role that doesn't allow her character to make much impact; indeed Jackman doesn't really either leaving us with Dev and a rather unintimidating gang of hoodlums and an ending that is certainly borrowed from quite a few others from the genre. No great shakes this one, sorry."
" Excellent!!! So emotional
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,10,"I love it! It's not just an action movie, it's so much more! I cry every time. It's so good! Really emotional."
" Rubbish
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,1,"Could have been a great movie, but it was just rubbish. Way too stupid."
" Disappointment
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,1,Chappie started out as a hero cop and then turned into a disappointing gangster with no return to grace.
" Good sci-fi
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,6,"Whilst not as good as it could have been and not without some plot holes, Chappie is still good sci-fi that's reasonably emotional and enjoyable. Sharlto Copley and Dev Patel are both great and Hugh Jackman is really good which makes up for Ninja's weak performance. The visual effects are really impressive but dip in quality during the finale. It's well paced and well filmed and Neill Blomkamp's direction is good. The music by Hans Zimmer is excellent."
" Could've easily been a 9 star movie
",2020-06-02 00:00:00,8,"The first time I tried watching, I gave up after 30 mins thinking this is one more half informed silly attempt at tackling the concept of AI. Gave it a second try when the movie got added on Netflix - the first 30 mins of the movie is a drag, nothing relevant seems to happen. Then things get very interesting, leading to a surprisingly insightful approach to AI. Not the most realistic ideas, but definitely more entertaining than all the other bleaky dark takes on the subject.
Give it a try, be patient, and you'll enjoy it."
" Astonished At The bad Reviews
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,10,"This is in my top 10
Special effects were fantastic the story and acting and concept was fabulous Yolandi and Ninja were the perfect quirky fit for the part it's a refreshing way of movie making loveeeee"
" Not quite District 9 but well worth a watch
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,7,"SPOILERS! -Another grouse film by Neill Blomkamp with Sharlto Comply proving again that he can move a viewer with a comedic performance. While I found the Ninja character terribly unlikable, even @ the end I did find myself invested, & saddened by the fate of his partners Yo-landi & Yankie (more so Yo-landi than Yankie).
I genuinely found myself caught up in the tension & suspence of a couple of the climactic moments.
While Hugh Jack man's stock villain is quite bland, Dev Patel's acting is believable, even if his characters actions are a bit frustrating @ times.
Exploring the idea of ""The Maker"" building a being ""just to die"" gives this bubblegum action movie a little more depth, giving the thoughtful viewer a chance for existentialist musing.
While certainly not a perfect film, largly borrowing the aesthetic of the superior 'District 9', Chappie is a very entertaining, turn your brain off film maintained my interest for the full runtime. I was surprised to see that the film was actually 2 hours long, the time flew by. Definately worth the investment."
" Dumb and smart at the same time.
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,8,This movie started dumb and by the end I was in a deep void of philosophical questioning about the definition of conscience and soul
" It was cool.
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,7,"-Interesting premise.
-Fun characters.-Overly annoying bad guy.
-Some really bizarre characters."
" Good production value and talented actors wasted on B-category screenplay
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,4,"Having just seen it for the first time, i wonder why did i bother.The only explanation that comes to mind for the existence of this movie is that at the moment it was made, Neill owed a considerable amount of money to either Tudor, Anri (ninja/yo-landi) or someone from their entourage and decided to take a plunge in his career to pay off his debt by making a Die Antwoord movie (cause thats what this actually is). if that would be the case, i find it mind-boggling that he got such a reasonable cast to get on board with this. Actually i wonder how they got on board anyway.
theres not much to say about the movie itself, the first 15-20 minutes seemed to promise another Neill Blomkamp blockbuster with ninja/yo-landi playing off their stage personas as best as they can (not much to expect there either), after-which it turns pretty fast into a cringe-fest by means of high-jacking what at first seemed to be an action packed Elysium sister/cousin and turning it into a childrens coming of age story/a promotional film for Die Antwoord.
the good - Sharlto Copleys performance
the bad - Die Antwoord/scriptBTW how is it that this gets 6.8 with some 10/10 reviews and Elysium gets 6.6?"
" Terrible, what a shame
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,2,"I didn't have any expectation prior to watching the movie, but it quickly became very boring and nonsensical.
The characters are not interesting, the robot doesn't make any sense and the plot is very stereotypical.
Special effects are okay but they don't save the movie. Very disappointing.I hope eventually movies about sentient robots and digitalized minds will fade away and cease to be made completely because they are all ludicrous from the start."
" If you hate its probably because you like movies like 50 shades of grey
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,10,"Just like Elysium its a beautiful movie with messages about people, earth and values. Must watch it."
" Don't waste brilliant concept for false reviews
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,10,Amazing movie. Why dont you make chappie 2 and 3 as planned.
" Die Die Antwoord, please
",2020-03-11 00:00:00,4,"I've seen Short Circuit many times before, and it's hard to deny that Chappie is extremely reminiscent of that film. The biggest difference between the two is that the people who end up in possession of Chappie are the most annoying human beings in South Africa. I know that Die Antwoord is a thing down there, but I swear their faux ""gangsta"" personalities are even more offensive than Fisher Stevens playing an Indian man. Every moment they were on screen, I was annoyed and wishing they would shut up. Then at the end, for some reason, they expect us to fear for their lives. I was anxious for them to die and stop ruining the movie. The funny thing is Hugh Jackman is also delivering a ridiculously over-the-top performance, but I didn't mind at all. It works coming from him, and he's supposed to be the villain anyways.The sad truth is, there's a decent film at the heart of Chappie. The visual effects of the robot are amazing, and Sharlto Copley's motion capture and voice work are brilliant. He embodies the innocence of a robot with an infantile mind to perfection. I also thought Dev Patel worked well as the brains behind the robots, and his conflict with Chappie made sense and created the one effective emotional arc in the film. It's just too bad that Neill Blomkamp decided to build the story around his friends Yo-Landi and Ninja instead of simply concentrating on what would make for the best film. I want to like this movie more, and it has a number of elements that I did enjoy. But I will probably just go back to watch Short Circuit or Robocop to get all the same story beats in a better film, despite the fact that Chappie had potential to be on par with one of those movies."
" Plodding, dull, misguided
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,5,"A film about a thinking robot in the midst of a gang warzone should be action packed, explosive and exciting.This film isn't any of those things.It's a film about 2 annoying 'gangsters' teaching a childlike robot to steal cars and steal money..Watch short-circuit...
Watch Robocop..
Both better.."
" Worth a watch -- ignore the critics
",2020-02-18 00:00:00,8,"Not sure why all the critics hated Chappie. I genuinely enjoyed this film.The South African setting was a new and a fun experience. Found the main character lovable and gunplay satisfying. Character design was pretty cool.4/5. Though there were some shortcuts taken with the plot, the film itself is not so bad."
" Ruined by a gangsta rap band I've never heard of...
",2020-02-16 00:00:00,2,"I tried to like this movie, because it reminded me of Short Circuit, another military/war machine/police-robot-with-sentience plot line. Chappie's like Johnny Five, naive and innocent and charming, and Sharlto Copley's South African accent is hilarious coming out of that robot. The actor's mannerisms and quirks are in him too so instead of seeing a robot I see Sharlto Copley playing as the robot. The CGI is great! It beautifully captures the actor's movements and portrays them perfectly to the CGI robot. It's just about as good as Andy Sirkis/Gollum's animation!But this is ruined by that gangsta rap South African band... the way they're portrayed it's as though viewers the world over are expected to ""just know"" who these weirdo's are. The only thing I've learned is that they cannot act. They look like feral mutts... they look weird, talk weird, commit a bunch of crimes that epic fail badly until Chappie comes along... if they really are supposed to be gangstas they are the most inept gangstas on Earth. Turning an assault rifle sideways while you fire it does not make you a badass gangsta... it just makes you miss your target with pretty much the same ineptitude of the average Imperial Stormtrooper. Sigh.These lowlife weirdo wannabe's teach the robot how to beat up, stab and shoot people and we the audience is supposed to find this cute and charming. The plot is all over the place. Hugh Jackman builds a BFG killer robot and Chappie beats up Wolverine (yeah... right!). Lucky for him Wolverine has a beer gut, wears a too-small safari outfit and is out of shape. The haphazard plot, bad pacing and unlikable characters just turns this movie into a complete mess. I was so disappointed with its outcome!Chappie is overshadowed by that wannabe gangsta band... they get too much dialogue, too much screen time, too much action scenes and their motivation is beyond a joke. If they were removed and replaced with more sympathetic characters this movie would've worked."
" Very entertaining, but flawed
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,8,"This is a really cute film, with good actors and acting, and great special effects. The story is interesting too. The many flaws are a serious detraction, but didn't stop me from watching to the end. But details matter. Some of the flaws are small, and I overlooked because handling them properly would have added to the film's length. But some of them were just awful for anybody with an ounce of tech knowledge. They jolt you back to reality when you're expected to believe stuff that couldn't possibly happen. It actually felt insulting that the film's makers expect us to go along with it. Spoilers ahead
As a programmer, I cringed when the AI program was good to go after one successful compile. He did say he was ready to test it on hardware, but the test consisted of loading it once, and off we go. In the real world, there are runtime errors that require code fixes, especially considering that this was the first AI program of its kind.Chappie's first ""instinct"" upon achieving consciousness was to exhibit fear and a desire to hide. As much as you might want to overlook it, Chappie is a robot, with programming, and that behavior would have had to be programmed. Why would you make that design decision? Makes no sense.The movie Short Circuit handled the education of a new AI lifeform much better. Chappie's learning seems to leapfrog without a basis to get there.A major error was the helmet used to read brainwaves. It was designed for human brains, yet it works perfectly when placed on a robot head. Does anybody think Chappie's head contains a human brain?We saw the police robots get fried circuits when they were all shut down. Yet at the end it just took a simple software reload and they're good to go again.Those are just off the top of my head. The movie was riddled with such glaring errors. It saddens me to see that they put so much effort into this movie, yet didn't bother to clean up the script to fix things like this. In spite of this, it's still worth seeing."
" Just a great movie
",2020-02-10 00:00:00,9,An interesting look at humanity. It really makes you think about how we effect one another on a daily basis. Charming and poignant.
" I think I hated this film the first time I saw this...
",2020-02-06 00:00:00,7,"...but upon seeing it a second time, knowing its flaws, of which there are many, but appreciating it as a piece of tremendous VFX work, solid directing, great cast and design, I enjoyed it a lot. Especially after Blomkamp's sister piece Elysium was such a backwards step from District 9, Chappie is a proper modern Cyberpunk story ripped straight from the novels, with a clever sort of abusive father figure in the hilarious Die Antwood's Ninja, a child-soldier allegory and Dev Patel's well-rounded Maker/Scientist character. I think the film could have done without the (always brilliant) Hugh Jackman and Sigourney Weaver characters and their subplots which veer into the generic and cliche. Which seems to be Blomkamp's MO these days; great, edgy, high concept and human ideas with superb execution wrapped up in a rote and passé shell with cutting edge visuals but ending up saying really nothing at all."
" Awesomeness!
",2020-02-03 00:00:00,10,"This is another masterpiece from Neill Blomkamp. It's simply awesome! And to add even more, we can see here Yolandi and Ninja from Die Antwoord. Must see movie!"
" Calm Down Haters!
",2020-01-30 00:00:00,8,"So this not only applies to this movie but to the review of all movies, calm down and understand the premise, I'll expand on what I mean. So for some reason there's this group of ""critics"" that always seem to feel the need to hold every single movie to a Oscar worthy standard, so for those critics calm down. This movie delivered on just about every aspect based on its Sci-Fi presentation, this isn't E.T. or Close Encounters of the Third Kind but that's ok because it's not trying to be that kind of movie. Honestly I find the concept and creativity very spot on and the ending definitely left me wanting a sequel, which unfortunately due to the ""oh this isn't Titanic"" level critics, will never happen because Blomkamp was basically personally scarred at the box office reception of this film. I'm finding myself lately ignoring the ""mainstream critics"" because many have zero understanding of putting films in their proper category to be judged accordingly, constantly nit picking every single detail and trying to criticize the authenticity of the movies events being able to happen in reality, HELLO!!!!!! It's a Sci-Fi movie for a reason, it's supposed to be creative beyond actual reality that's the whole point, DUH!"
" Cool movie. Absolutely enjoyable.
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,9,"It's refreshing, funny and also innocent. It's not Schindler's List, all right, but it is like a fairy tale with robots instead of princesses and wizards. I loved te story, the acting, the effects, it's well put together."
" One of the best science fiction
",2020-01-18 00:00:00,10,"If one ever imagine that AI can be as powerful as our mind, than this movie is worse to see. Of course, some details can always be criticized in any movie however, these are so unimportant in Chappie that I am not getting annoyed even after many times seeing the film."
" Better than District 9
",2020-01-07 00:00:00,8,"I was a big fan of ""District 9"" from the moment I saw it in theaters. Unfortunately, Blomkamp's next outing ""Elysium"" (2013) was poorly received and, in general, a complete mess of a film. When Blomkamp's next movie ""Chappie"" was slated for release, I was pretty excited because of my love for ""District 9"" but felt it wise to temper that excitement considering ""Elysium."" As the reviews began trickling in and people I knew started seeing it, I got the feeling that the consensus was that it wasn't very good. With only so much time and money at my disposal during that period of my life, I decided to skip it.O Boy, did I make the wrong choice. In fact, I think I might like ""Chappie"" more than ""District 9.""This film, while I found it incredibly moving, is not exactly an original outing for Neill Blomkamp. Structurally the film is very similar to ""District 9."" We get some incredibly well done world building which explains how the main novelty of the film, in this case a robotic police force, came to be and also the ways that it has affected various people groups and their opinions of that novelty. Then, we get some inciting incident brought on by a naive individual transgressing in some way.
Next, some soul searching and personal growth as large corporate interests are trying to take advantage of the new revelations brought on my the inciting incident,. In this case, The corporation seeks to destroy Chappie because of the liability he presents to them. Finally, we arrive at a bittersweet ending which culminates in a large action sequence or two.I can definitely understand why, if someone connects to ""District 9"" they may not feel the need or attraction for this film since it has so many similar beats. For me, however, I think I prefer ""Chappie"" not because any of the above mentioned similarities but because of the thematic difference in the films.Thematically, ""Chappie"" focuses primarily on a compressed view of human development in the form of an incredibly powerful Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) who goes through those stages incredibly quickly. As a result, I found that it connected with me on a far more individual human level than ""District 9"" which focuses primarily on group dynamics and prejudices. In that film, I am already on the 'side' of the film saying that the refugees need to be treated with respect and understanding so it all has a bit of a 'preaching to the choir vibe' that felt, to me, more like someone saying 'don't you see this is wrong?' over and over for a couple hours, albeit in an incredibly entertaining and layered way, even though I already agreed with them.With ""Chappie,"" I don't feel like there are sides that I am being asked to be on or grow out of and into another. Maybe that's because I'm reading too much into the mind of Blomkamp's intentions in ""District 9"" but I think it's because he had grown since making that movie. ""Chappie"" Feels more like a meditation, at times, on the mysteries of what it means to be human. Nature and nurture, personal responsibility and societal responsibility, self determination and respect for the freedoms of others; all are deftly handled in a film which, from the previews, looks more like and action thriller with a bit of heart.Another reason that I like this film so much is its treatment of the characters. Don't get me wrong, Wikus from ""District 9"" is a brilliant, richly developed, complicated character whose arc is one of the most interesting parts of that film. ""Chappie"" however is that times 5 since every character feels more fleshed out and powerfully realized. This is certainly due to some fine writing and directing, but also is helped tremendously by a larger, more talented and experienced cast.Instead of a standard White Guy CEO as the villain we get Sigourney Weaver (""Alien,"" 1979). Instead of a by the numbers generic mercenary we get Hugh Jackman (""Logan,"" 2017) as a jealous rival engineer (who has power armor.) Dev Patel ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" 2008) is tapped to play Chappie's creator/father/god and Sharlto Copley (""Hardcore Henry,"" 2015) performs a great bit of voice acting and motion capture as Chappie but the real standouts for me are Chappie's foster parents played by Ninja and Yo-Landi Visser of the South African Rap/Rave group Die Antwoord. These poor, disorganized, hardened gangsters will have you looking at everyone you encounter and asking 'what kind of parents must that person have had?'All in all, I was happy to add ""Chappie"" to my list of modern Sci-Fi classics and am certain I'll be revisiting it for years to come. If you are a sci-fi fan and haven't gotten around to this one yet, it's time."
" I found it in between. Better than Elysium, but District 9 is clearly the best.
",2020-01-05 00:00:00,6,"It was very well filmed, but didn't have a clear tone. When Chappie worked with the criminals after being separated from his master, I couldn't tell if some of the scenes were funny or serious. In fact, the last act worked best with the twist on what happens to his master and I wish that was more of the story. There still could've been a movie involving another subplot with the girl in the film's final scene. They shouldn't have ended it so abruptly. Maybe the last act should have started the story. It seemed unfocused. The opening fake documentary footage was unnecessary and felt like it was referencing District 9."
" Shoulda listened to my friends
",2019-12-12 00:00:00,3,"Everyone warned me this movie is awful, and man do I wish I listened. That's 2 hours out of my life I can't get back."
" I liked it! - Dont believe the critics
",2019-11-20 00:00:00,9,"I was expecting a pretty standard SF movie with some androids, but boy, was i mistaken :)
I had no idea where the movie was going (that was a good thing).It has humor, and i was laughing quite a bit.
The movie has action, some drama, and also philosophical ideas about what life and consciousness actually is.
Hugh Jackman did a great job as a frustrated engineer!Also, the movements of Chappie were well done.
Some of the acting of the gang members could be better, but stillI recommend this movie!
Don't understand why critics seem want to bash this movie with bad reviews"
" A dash of Short Circuit, add in some Robocop mix with Die Antwood and Hugh Jackman and you get an entertaining movie
",2019-11-19 00:00:00,6,"This was a surprise like for me. I didn't have very high expectations but I did end up enjoying this movie. It is fairly predictable and a little cheesy, you kind of know how this movie is going to go once everyone is introduced.Even with that is was pretty entertaining. I found Die Antwood was not as bad I I was expecting (there music is the soundtrack to the movie...obvi)It's kind of an action movie, kind of a drama. The basics are a robot AI is adopted by some gangsters who train it to do their bidding, the twist being the gangsters are the anti heros of the movie. The bad guy is introduced (Hugh Jackman), who rocks a mullet so hard in this movie, and the battle of good guys vs bad guys sets the scene for the rest of the movie.I would recommend this to anyone who liked District 9 (that was a way better movie) or anyone who liked Short Circuit."
" Big disappointment and just a bunch of tobacco product placements
",2019-11-08 00:00:00,2,"Chappie is a disappointment of a movie for me. The plot is about a police robot who gets an unauthorized upgrade and become sentient/conscious.
Positives:
Decent special effects. Interesting setting in Johanasburg. Adequate overall plot.
Negatives:
Tons of cigarette smoking. More blatant product placements by the tobacco companies which ruined yet another film.
Cartoonish costumes for the gangsters and gangs.
Cruddy background music.
Very poor acting by most of the cast. Dev Patel is the only one who rises above mediocre in the acting shown in this movie. He does pretty well. Otherwise, all the characters are flat, wooden, and predictably over-the-top or bland. Some big name stars who do not shine in their acting and sound like a first read. Very disappointed in that.
Blatant rip off from the original Robo-cop series of movies, but not done nearly as well as the Peter Weller films.
Felt emotionally manipulated by the story. I really didn't care about any of the characters by the end.
My grade, a D. Big disappointment."
" That's the extreme of an AI technology can do.

The movie was awesome , the producers only mistake were introducing chappie in 2015 when 2019 is the perfect time for a movie like chappie , if u make chappie 2 I'm sure more so positive that it will sell big , the movie had no business in rotten tomatoes , even the quality of the movie is great , everyone wants chappie 2 . I want to see chappie 2 ,"
" I couldn't tell if it was a satire or a comedy.
",2019-10-16 00:00:00,1,I couldn't tell if it was a satire or a comedy. Acting was bad. Hugh Jackman's character was a caricature.
" No likeable characters.
",2019-10-11 00:00:00,1,"The VFX is fantastic, but there are no likeable characters.The AI geek is completely unconvincing. It takes deep thought and knowledge about psychology to do his job, but his character has none. Feels more like a teenager on a field trip.The ""bad guys"" feel like jacked up pizza delivery guys on a break. Mean nothing they say even though they yell.Hugh Jackman's character is a guy inventing a larger robot and gives a presentation at one point, but his hair is still combed straight-forward (and with a mullet) like an australian road worker/miner.Sigourney Weaver's character is just a stone wall. So you never look forward to hearing her speak.The Chappie robot itself, starts off acting rediculously afraid, and the film is edited around you relating to this for a solid 15 minutes... as if a hyper afraid slavish attitude is the norm.Directing, editing, script, acting... what is wrong with people... were good movies all ""luck"" before??"
" I feel sorry for chappie, being stuck in this movie.
",2019-09-29 00:00:00,6,"You know youve got issues when your best best acting is from the robot. Id been avoiding this movie because Id heard Die Antword had made filming very difficult and it got messy. I try to keep an open mind but imagine your reaction if youd found out Violent Jay of ICP would be starring in a WWII drama. Thats not the end of the movies problems though. Its a lot of the classic ""why is this happening?"" ""because we need it to for the plot to move forward."" scenes and in the end whatever you expect is exactly what happens.
good-
chappie is great.
bad -
painfully bad acting
plot written in crayola.
generic samie story.soooo meh."
" Could have been better but I enjoyed it.
",2019-09-21 00:00:00,8,"If you are looking for an action packed film this is not for you. The low rating came from people who wanted alot of action like from other movies that cam out the same year like Mad Max, Star Wars The Force Awakens or Avengers Age of Ultron, however they all had budgets of 3 to 5 times as much, so not bad for the budget they had.
The concept of the movie was not bad but the over all story could have been better."
" Die Antwoord cast and the robot actor ruin the movie.
",2019-09-06 00:00:00,1,"The movie has a nice concept, but the actors from the band Die Antwoord can't act to save their lives. They act like a bunch of children reading a script that makes you doubt their sanity.The dialogue between the characters is embarrassing and their actions make little to no sense and are unrealistic.
It is very obvious the robot Chappie is an actor in a green-screen suit who tries to act like a child, but does such a bad job on it and resembles more a parody of an adult imitating a child."

" Fantastic Film
",2019-08-13 00:00:00,9,"Such a fantastic film, regardless of the reviews it has got.
Chappie is well written, visually amazing, and sometimes quite emotional.
It follows the story of a decommissioned police robot that is given the gift of life by Deon, a programmer who develops a prototype AI."
" Heatbreaking and charming.
",2019-08-11 00:00:00,5,"Let me make this clear, this film isnt a masterpiece and you shouldnt go into this film thinking that. Its a fun extremely visually well made movie (We'll go into that later)
Though this film is fun, i can also be really sad. Since Chappie is just an extremely intelligent curious baby. He doesn't think there's any evil in the world so it really hits hard with some animal abuse themes when some teenage boys throw rocks at him, cut off his arm and set him on fire.This film is absolutely visually stunning. Chappie is some of the best motion capture work i've seen since Avatar. The studio really nailed it with the cg on this one. It gives me headaches just thinking about how they put those chains on a real person in a motion capture suit and somehow making it look real. Hats off to the cg studio."
" Amazing! Ignore the reviews!!
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,10,"I have just watched this film and I honestly can not believe the reviews people are saying. It has an amazing storyline, really makes you develope feelings for the characters! Full of action and very cleverly put together! Such an amazing film and the graphics were out of this world! Would recommend anyone to watch this film.. 5****"
" A film that goes unrecognized for flawless excecution!
",2019-07-16 00:00:00,10,"Of the many films in existence, there are truely too many for someone to watch all of them. This is why we lean towards critics (in our eyes more experienced in the critical analysis and review of films) to get our ´more educated' reviews on the latest most seemingly interesting films that we may want to watch. However, a film is not defined by cast, budget, or the title of a largely known film company, but the immersion and further entertainment of the audience whomever or wherever they might be. This is why I am now going through some of my more favorite films, rewatching, reviewing, and possibly suggesting them to others, such as this film in itself... Chappie. Greatly blindsided by the hidden talent in acting within South African Hip Hop duo, Die Antwoord, the seemingly experienced two performed very well throughout scenes in the entirety of the film with not a single error or flaw in their performance. You know how some films you watch a scene and think ´that could have been done better'? Well this just so happens to be one of few Action/Adventure films that don't suffer from that same fate. At no point in this film did I find a lack of competence in writing, directing, screenplay or acting throughout. This is a definite recommendation for anyone who enjoys intense action with equally intense emotional connection between the characters themselves, and the highs and lows they face. 10/10."
" Epic movie
",2019-07-02 00:00:00,10,"A proper watch, great action, good plot, some serious tear jerkers in it but all round great film. I'd pay to watch the second if they make one, heck if I had the money I'd pay them to make it!"
" good, not great
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,6,"Good action, awesome musical score (Hans never fails). I didn't love the story and didn't feel for a lot of the characters. some good humor. not that I minded but it was basically a new version of Robocop (2 viewings, 1/1/2021)

even tho I liked the ending it was basically the same ending as district 9, directed by the same person"
" simply put potential full but too ""family friendly"" and dulled down

" Don't listen to the Dumb Critics and Watch It!
",2019-05-09 00:00:00,10,"Most of the critics I'm reading here watched 15 minutes of the movie or half and hour and decided to come here and say the movie sucks. why haven't they watched the whole movie? because people want fast-food like movies who are easy to digest not well written and directed Movies like this one. Chappie has it all, action, comedy, heartwarming cinematography, this movie will make you love robots as if it was a puppy! Give it a chance and watch the whole thing before coming here babbling about what you don't understand! Watch if and decide for yourself. Just giving it a 10 for the dumb people giving it a 1 and 3 who don't even like this genre of movies and don't even base their review opinions since they've watched a short movie clip."
" District 9??? Rubbish
",2019-04-24 00:00:00,8,"Sure, I'm late. Bite me.This movie has only one connection to District 9 ( great movie BTW, robbed of best film due to PC BS ), and that is where it was shot. This is an amazing merging of RoboCop and Short Circuit, with a harder edge.
Everything about this works, except for an unusually wooden performance from Jackman.Not Oscar material, but who really cares about the Academy anymore, self serving creeps that they are? Watch Chappie for its fun, and its great characterisation of an awakening AI."
" Chappie's funny, the rest is awful
",2019-04-14 00:00:00,1,"A really uncomfortable watch, filled with sexism, a girlfriend who's terrified of her boyfriend, terrible acting by Die Antword who are in it far too much. I felt sorry for Chappie throughout. Chappie was a good character & funny. The developer's character was also good."
" We need a sequel.
",2019-04-10 00:00:00,10,"If there was ever a movie that needed a sequel more than another, it's Chappie."
" Fabulous
",2019-03-31 00:00:00,10,"This was a fabulous movie, funny in parts, poignant throughout, & dramatic! Loved the ending, thank you! Must say when I first saw Hugh Jackman I thought it was someone else 'playing' Hugh Jackman (if you get my drift) - a truly evil character indeed. Overall, a mivie I would highly recommend. Note - give yourself time to get used to the accents. :) enjoy!"
" Worst movie ever!!
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,1,My friends re-enacted this at a dinner party and their acting was awful!! The story line sucked and the food was cold
" Wonderful movie!
",2019-03-21 00:00:00,10,"My own theory as to why this movie is bashed by critics is the usual reason:It is politically incorrect!Gangsters are shown to be BAD. They even try to corrupt an innocent robot, and we all know in the REAL world they would never do so- only the evil white patriarchy would do something like that!It is a great movie, with believable (if flawed) characters, and the ending is PERFECT! Of course, the gangsters had to be white, even in South Africa (where they are all really black), but even so, that makes it unpalatable to liberals everywhere...But watch it!! It is really compelling, and you will miss your MOMMY!"
" Chappies' The Man
",2019-03-15 00:00:00,9,I pulled heavy for Chappie. This movie was weird and random but different and entertaining.
" A Real Misfire
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,6,"Continuing my plan to watch every Hugh Jackman movie in order, I come to Chappie (2015)Plot In A Paragraph: In the near future, crime is patrolled by a mechanized police force. When one police droid, Chappie, is stolen and given new programming, he becomes the first robot with the ability to think and feel for himself.Chappie is a total misfire. While there is merit in some of the ideas raised in Chappie, the weaknesses overwhelm the strengths, leaving me underwhelmed by an avalanche of explosions, special effects and awful dialogue.The characters are so one dimensional they are practically caricatures. Dev Parel, probably comes out of this the best. Hugh Jackman who is hamming it up, with the worst hair cut of his career, said he loved players my the bad guy in interviews, but had just comes off as awkward.Chappie grossed just $31 million (on a $49 million budget) at the domestic box office, to end the year as the 82nd highest grossing movie of 2015."
" It's a movie
",2019-03-04 00:00:00,5,"This is a very movie movie. It's well shot, competantly directed, great special effects and action, okay story, and spotty acting. If you know Neill Blomkamp, you already know if you like it or not. I'm rather indifferent to him. I would reccomend it if you are a fan of him or Die Antwoord. I am neither, so I was luke warm on the whole affair. The ending, however, felt out of place and contradictory to the prior established rules of the movie. I'd say skip it."
" Unexpectedly enjoyable and definitely worth watching
",2019-03-03 00:00:00,8,"A film about almost but not quite indestructible Police Robots in an out-of-control Johannesburg, where one unit designated to be crushed is instead given consciousness and - needing to learn everything from the basics upwards - unfortunately gets taught how to behave by an interesting threesome of drug-dealing. gun-toting Gangstas, occasionally assisted by the scientist who created the Police Robots.
The concept is played out with style by a series of lesser known actors with two or three big names thrown into the melting pot. The end result is a surprisingly enjoyable drama - although it does also include gun fights, explosions, bad-guys and sadness.
Chappie himself will touch the viewer, even though he is a construct. The inter-play between the main characters could have been visualised better, but that would have made the film longer. At two hours the film is just about the right length and the viewers will each have his/her own ideas about how the story could have been developed, thus prompting discussion (isn't that really what films are meant to do - to create a situation where the viewer asks 'what could happen next'?)
The final 'solution' in the film is unusual and - although not entirely original - actually works.
Watch and enjoy. It is worth giving two hours of your life to this film, even if you never watch it again."
" A glimmer of hope but deeply flawed.
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,6,"The movie, not the robots or people.Evil corporation, evil mercenary, trite criminals, and stereotypical nerd protagonist. Should have been called Tropes and Robots.There's good in there, but too much is derivative, and too poorly put together of an overall story.Reminded me of the also-fine-not-great (and no relation to the source) I Robot in the themes of automation. I'd love to see Blomkamp given something with a great arc to work from, like some Asimov work, and a co-writer to keep him in check. Something great could come from this."

I am totally bemused as to how anyone could give it a low rating. They must be either depressed or lack creativity and a multitude of other things to see how this film is brilliant.There are inklings of Short Circuit and RoboCop in this film plus much more. The way Chappie evolves in this film is superb and the ending is a stroke of genius. I really hope a sequel to see Chappies new life. This film has all the elements of becoming a cult movie with an intune fan base. I for certain am one.

Worked on every level for me; story, characters, cgi, humour and feeling.'Chappie' is one of the most endearing protagonists I've ever encountered, and Yolandi and Ninja are pretty likeable villains as well.Pure art and pure heart with a political sub text.Love it. Hoping for a sequel."
" Crappie

The third act is especially bad.It's as if Blomkamp was having an identity crisis while he was making this movie. One minute it's a family movie, then it's action, then it's drama, then it's a comedy...you get the idea.And putting Die Antwoord in this movie is easily it's worst element. They're pretty annoying most of the time. Stick to music. Not acting."

But this is a waste of time.Seriously a mindless action flick trying to produce unnecessary philosophical assumptions on humanity and it is without any logic and the story flows without any premise.Like I said an unworthy film of every aspect because in my personal view of trying to be a wannabe philosophical film on human nature.

The over-sized creature makes its appearance several times throughout the movie, and each time I just had to look away.It was hilarious when Yolandi and the others are teaching Chappie how to speak and Yolandi keeps saying, ""Rat ... Rat ... Rattt...!!"" The scene was ridiculous and gross. Yes, Chappie learned that word all too well. For this and other reasons (well documented by other reviewers) I can only give a 1 Star rating."
" Novelty value, but not much depth

And the plot has a few nice original ideas - having to train an AI, for example. But overall the plot involves too many side lines that its hard to know what the main story actually is. But the sci fi elements are reasonably well drawn and the main character, Chappie, is engaging enough to pull the film along. So though flawed in many ways, this is worth checking out if your any sort of sci fi fan."
" Short Circuit and Robocop Misfire
",2018-09-29 00:00:00,7,"I wanted to love this movie but the screenplay borrows too much from the above mentioned films. Thsi is a Pinocchio tale with a twist. ""Chappie"" is part of several hundred ""Robocop"" wannabees that have no human soul. There is a protagonist ""bad"" robot called ""Moose"" that steps in at the finale somewhat like in ""Robocop 2"" So you have a violent gang that is the excuse for most of the murder and mayhem in the film, with a ""crazy"" leader that requires subtitles as his English accent is atrocious. Enter the nice programmer who reprograms a robot to be ""alive"" and two barely-bad villains who nurture Chappie. He calls one ""mommy"". An attempt at humor is made when the rest of the violent gang turns Chappie into a ""bad-ass"", complete with gold chains, as he robs money and steals cars. A waste of time for the talents of Sigorny Weaver and Hugh Jackman. Like all ""Frankenstein"" Tales, order is restored to the humans in the end, with the surprising turn-of-events as the 3 ""heroes"" are now all robotic. Sequels were planned..."
" wasn't bad but could have been better
",2018-09-27 00:00:00,5,"Just going to list a one a few gripes with this movie, others have more comprehensive reviews.chappie is probably one of the only likeable characters!chappie's creator spends maybe 5 minutes tops interacting with chappie (and I am being generous), gives him a book, a chicken and this is somehow long enough to create some kind of bond? most dialogue between him and chappy boils down to greetings, saying ""I am your creator"" and addressing chappie, every time he goes to visit the badguys they throw him out!! its hilarious, and he usually leaves yelling things like ""he is mine"" and morally motivating things like ""don't do bad!""the only other characters chappy gets to bond with and the criminals that for some inexplicable reason he likes after they tried to get him killed and lied to him about almost everything repeatedly! and he somwhow still feels a bond towards them.too many convenient plot points and the ending was a little meh too, they could have ended it at the grave, think that part afterwards and the usb drive didn't need to exist"
" Pretty funny film good Sci-Fi

" Ages ahead! Not a crime to think beyond the horizon, Critics!
",2018-09-11 00:00:00,9,"I am shocked to see the reviews and ratings undermining this movie. I mean if the audience cannot perceive the meaning and fathom its beauty, they ought to stay away from any prejudice towards it. 'Cause mostly it may be possible that your perception may prevaricate people from actually admiring it. 'Nuf said!"
" An amalgam of robotics and emotions
",2018-08-23 00:00:00,8,"1.Genre- Action, crime, drama2. Rating- 8/103. One liner- Good plot but ending was not properly executed.4. Plot summary- This is a story about Deon an engineer who has created robots for acquiring the purpose for reducing crimes but he turned out to create a robot of his own with emotions amidst a series of mishaps. But certain events causes the robot to realize his origin, the fundamentals of consciousness, the durability of his own existence leading to Deon taking measures including one that had a drastic impact on him as well.5. Events- Certain points in the movie are quite emotional and mesmerizing including when the robot recognizes certain things initially, including the chase scene where Moose removes the guard key from the robot's system6. Film making- Dev Patel did complete justice to the character, the robot's childish voice is quite commendable. Overall a complete package7. Potential viewers- All those who are into robotics, Sci-fi-people can very much coordinate on such levels8. Verdict- A go-go!! Certain points in the movie are quite nice such as the concept of consciousness and the transfer of emotions in robot is quite a fact to come across, rest assured it's a total entertainer."
" Good movie, why critcs hate it tío much
",2018-08-15 00:00:00,8,"I watched this movie three month after his reléase in teathers, i liked the movie although has strong language And too violent, but i can't understand why critcs and other audience hates too much. Having only 30 up 100 in rotten tomatoes and 6.8 here is really worth seeing because has a good message, and is too different compared with others sci Fi movies, i think this movie would ve remember like a cult movie."
" ""Crappie"" is one of the dumbest movies I ever watched.
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,3,"I never knew a movie could have such potential yet be so thoroughly and ignorantly disappointing. Moreover, they simply plagiarized Robocop and changed a few nuances.Crappie falls flat in every way. The so-called comedy is overshadowed by the carnage and the all over the place story line. You have so called thugs who are on-again and off-again about killing the ""maker"". You have a ""maker"" who comes and goes into a den of wannbe thugs as though he is just going out for coffee. I was even disappointed at how the thugs were portrayed to be beyond dumb and ignorant. Even thugs are more competent than the way they are portrayed in this idiotic film.I don't see how anyone could rate this film as a 9 or 10. I completely understand everyone having their own tastes. However, some things simply stink no matter who smells it. Crappie is by far one of the worst, inconsistent films in modern history. It takes ignorance to new heights."
" Very good
",2018-07-17 00:00:00,10,"Brilliant, touching. Interesting study on the development of a sentient mind in fast-forward mode (like many AI experts are saying it could go) Though liking and understanding Die Antwoord does help appreciating it, I'm sure."
" Bad Robot
",2018-06-25 00:00:00,2,"Terrible. Terrible movie. It is one long ""Die Antwoord"" music video loosely based on RoboCop and Short Circuit."
" I knew it wasnt gonna be good yet im still dissappointed
",2018-06-06 00:00:00,4,Terrible acting by the non-actors. Everything happens weirdly fast and can hardly make you interested in any part of the story. Even the great cgi can save this thing.Its about a robot that gains consciousness and it gets emotionally attached to some people.
" Future of A.I
",2018-05-30 00:00:00,7,Amazing movie with great vfx about near future of A.I and humans.
" Chappie reminds me of a modernized & re-worked Short Circuit
",2018-04-28 00:00:00,5,"I know the Short Circuit franchise was before many modern young people were even able to see it. But Johnny 5 was also a lethal robot designed for the military, not the police force. And he also dealt with evil people\bad situations too.Chappie is a good movie for youngsters maybe, but I just wasn't feeling it too much. Die Antwoord(Ninja & Yolandi) overacted IMO too."
" Could have been much (much much) better
",2018-04-18 00:00:00,4,"I am so sorry to see such a great story being messed up so much by few unprofessional scenes. I think that Hugh Jackman and few other actors have done what they're expected to do, but most scenes of the ""creator"", and the ""gang"", who had the major roles in this movie, have completely ruined the story, changing it from a serious, hard-core sci-fi movie, into a messy and cheap comedy. I would put ""Real Steel"" and ""Transformers"" in a level way above this one, although the drama and emotional development in the story of ""Chappie"" is better. Yet, thanks to the unprofessionality of few scenes, I saw the movie turned into a sequence of boring pictures. This is a movie that had the potential to be one of a kind, but it turned into a waste of .. almost everything."
" Funny, sad, badass, and deep.
",2018-04-17 00:00:00,10,"People who couldn't enjoy this SCI-FI movie are missing the point of a science-fiction movie. Key word: FICTION. And great fiction at that.

" This movie is the bomb

" Another movie critics wrongly trashed and sheep didn't give a chance
",2018-04-01 00:00:00,10,"Very, very good movie. Only saw it in theaters because i saw promise in the trailers and liked Bloomkamp's District 9. I actually gave it a chance and it was great. Lots of other people just acted like sheep and came in hating it, coupled with the emphasis on South African culture, people didn't give it a chance.Seeing movies like this fail shows that change is coming to the movie industry. Plenty of great projects are just being trashed undeservingly because audiences never get a chance to make opinions for themselves."

" Robo baby.
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,9,This is a weird sci-fi dystopian movie about a robot being born to an Indian creator who loses him to some wannbe gangsters and what appears to be South Africa. The robot named chappie is a metaphor for The Human Experience as we all experience. He goes through trials and tribulations to eventually learn what it means to be human as a robot with and expiration as we humans have. Throughout the course of this movie we eventually sympathize and empathize with a robot who is used and abused by the systems of surrounding him as his only goals are to keep living.
" I Cut Onions Throughout the Film
",2018-03-18 00:00:00,8,"I saw this in the cinema and loved it. I recently purchased the DVD to watch again and it made me realise what a sappy person I've become in those 3 years. I had way too much pathos for the childlike kill bot, Chappie. Chappie (the film) highlights just how corrupt, self serving and downright cruel humans can be. The titanium bubba really wasn't shown much love throughout the film. So why watch it? Because Chappie is such an endearing, likeable character and his character arc is fascinating to watch; you get to see Hugh Jackman play a mullet wearing bully-boy who bandies about Australian idioms (which, as an Australian, we really don't say) with aplomb; robots- killer robots everywhere!I feel like if you've seen any of Neill Blomkamp's films you know what to expect. High tech, abused innocents and psychotic villains. It's just with Chappie, some of the psychotic villains show more compassion than those on the side of ""good"". I know why this film divides viewers. The acting isn't slick (but for me it adds to the realism) and the story isn't the most cohesive or believable- but hey- it's escapist sci-fi- not a bio-pic!Watch Chappie. It's a dystopian Aesop fable with heart. That we should all be as honest and decent as that flicky-eared assassin."
" A pleasant and intriguing watch
",2018-03-09 00:00:00,7,"I was already familiar with some of Neil Blomkamp's work, namely District 9. Viewers of that film will recognize his style in the use of TV newsbits (featuring a very real Anderson Cooper segment) and documentary-style filmmaking to drive his point home. Yet what makes this film a standout is the way in which it portrays AI, making the experience seem almost relatable to that of fathering a baby. While the movie does take a few predictable turns, and the climax is stretched-out beyond belief, it is a decent piece of work and one that took me by surprise at a few moments. The amount of emotions the film conveys are surprising, given that the main character is supposed to be a robot, but we come to love and care for him nonetheless through his struggles in the slum. The actors do a terrific job of harnessing these emotions, and conveying all the ethical quandaries that one would have creating AI, but also raising a child. Dev Patel, as always, is fantastic. Hugh Jackman does a wonderful job of making an otherwise-unbelievable villain slightly more human, but the real spotlight goes to Ninja (south-african rapper who portrays a fictionalized version of himself in this film) and Yolandi Visser as Chappie's ""parents"", namely the thugs who try to give him an education. Their evolution as characters, particularly Ninja's, is fun to watch throughout the entire movie, and provides a redeeming storyline parallel to Chappie's own. Finally, Sharlto Copley steals the show as the title character, even if his role is essentially a voice one, by making us believe that Chappie's angsts are very real, and that yes, robots can have a soul. I must say Chappie's literal evolution as a character was pleasant to watch, and, while the action at the end was a bit overkill, it helped make this is a very decent film. While this movie helps to open a conversation about AI, don't trust this film to venture too far into it. Instead expect a fun, decent and intriguing sci-fi movie with a premise not-all-that unbelievable."
" The other side of AI, the beautiful one.
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,8,"Its not the same old ""Artificial Intelligence taking over the world"" kind of a story, but begins with the inevitable and obvious,disruption of human society. What leads to this you ask?watch the movie and find out.
Its my first Neill Blomkamp movie, and I must say I relished every single moment of it. The concept of AI had to be introduced by some nerdy-brainy scientist-programmer and that role was played by Dev Patel. Ex-military turned engineer, the main antagonist Hugh Jackman was the main reason I wanted to watch the movie in the first place.
And of course, not to forget the main lead, Chappie himself, voiced by Sharlto Copley.
The fact that this movie doesn't take place in New York, or any other part of the States prone to alien attacks or rise of deadly zombies, is comforting.
The evolution of the character Chappie is a beautiful journey. A loving and caring mom, and a drunken mean father, also a understanding uncle, are the roles played by the supporting cast. The story does show the ugly side of human nature, with every single person being self centred. The 'maker' Dev Patel wanted to test his newly developed AI program and used Chappie as a test subject. Ninja plays the role of a daddy who again tricks Chappie into crimes for his personal gain, and looks at him like he is nothing more than a pile of talking metal chunk. Hugh Jackman, jeopardizes the safety of the whole city, just so that he can test his own ""superior drone"" and taste success,on which Dev Patel was basking till now.His superior drone, is literally over-kill and ruthless, literally cutting a man in half. 
In all this self-centeredness and mayhem, Chappie doesnt lose his humble and kind hearted nature. Not only that he makes you love him by his childish antics in the beginning, makes your eyes moist as he feels pain(actually he can't) but he surpasses his creator, his 'maker' and creates something bigger, better, something which only can be dreamed of. Exactly that should be the purpose of AI, to go beyond capabilities of humans to create something more. Every other film,(or at least many of them) focus on the dark side of AI, but this one shows that if nurtured with love, AI can help solve the ultimate question, making fiction into reality.
One more thing that I really like, in any movie is to end it with a question which makes viewers want more, which keeps the possiblity of the second part alive, which can continue to live on its legacy and take it forward.
Chappie is a really under-rated movie, and if you want to watch something beautiful such as a robot more human than its creator himself, then this makes up for a really touching and rewarding affair."
" Tripe
",2018-02-02 00:00:00,2,"The basic storyline should have been OK - gangsters steal a police robot that happens to be an AI prototype, and reprograms/trains it to act for them - helped by the AI expert.
 
However it is nonsense that the AI expert having been kidnapped, beaten up and then released by the gangsters, keeps returning to them and his robot again and again, effectively assisting the gangsters. He does this out of of love for his AI prototype (which has a ridulously cute personality) and his wish to teach it art and poetry. It does not occur to him to inform the police of the theft and the gangsters whereabouts, nor to the gangsters that he might do so.
 
SInce the stolen robot is physically a standard model, and the AI program looks like it is on an SD card, you wonder why the AI expert could not have continued his experiments with another robot another time. Did he fail to keep a copy of the AI software?"

Thank you"
" What if Jar Jar Binks was a ROBOT?!?
",2018-01-12 00:00:00,1,"Neill Blomkamp created a masterpiece; a film that perfectly balanced visually stunning effects with a compelling plot and characters, and that film was District 9. Then came the shallow mess that was Elysium that while lacking a likeable protragonist still managed to be a treat to the eyes at the very least.Then came Chappie. I really wanted to like Chappie, a lot. Some of the best ideas are the simplest, and in spite of the negative reception I could see much potential in a twisted comedy action film about a good-willed robot being trained by scumbags. This isn't the case with this film. Many of the elements I had expected were in play, however the tone was relentlessly sinister and dour where a more levitous approach would have been vastly more interesting. The film feels too mean-spirited to be enjoyable.The gangsters Chappie finds himself involved with are beyond trashy in the worst kind of way, and upon realization that they would be a large portion of the next 2 hours of my life, I was filled with dread. Chappie isn't flawless himself - his benevolence going against any notion I have of ""realistic"" robots. Chappie is quite simply a human character placed in the husk of a robot, and once I got past that I soon found myself annoyed with the repetitive scenes of Chappie in peril and confusion, always responding with squawking and sulking, giving me that feeling I have when I'm being beaten over the head with a message, only it seems the message is missing.Hugh Jackman plays a one-dimensional baddie not unlike what you'd get in a Saturday morning cartoon. His only motivation is that his weapons were shafted in favor of the crime-fighting robots, so then he turns to terrorism I guess. I guess this is where that missing message is; mean people are bad, and you should just be a good person, and robots are people too.Everything in this film is simply surface level, when the only way it could have had a chance is by being deep - higher highs, lower lows, and stronger motivations.The worst part is I feel like the film ended right when the story was just getting started. There's a chance for something here, but this trilogy is otherwise dead on arrival."
" Good robot coming-of-age story
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"'Chappie' is Blomkamp's third film, after 'District 9' and 'Elysium' and easily sits between them in terms of quality. It's a near-future tale of artificial intelligence and how this could play out on a small and large scale. It's nothing new ('Terminator', 'Short Circuit'), but it is done in an interesting way. Deon (Patel) develops ""scouts"" (basically literal robocops), which Vincent (Jackman) wants to supersede with his mech-warriors. When Deon creates an AI ""conscious"", Chappie is ""born"".Unfortunately for Chappie, his ""parents"" are Ninja & Yo-Landi from 'Die Antwoord', a South African rap-rave ""band"" (thanks Wikipedia. If you haven't heard them before, don't bother!) I can only assume Blomkamp loves their music (god knows how) and asked them to be in this as a favour. Their faux-gangster act forces Chappie into doing things he doesn't want to and disaster ensues. Jackman is adequately douchey as the Aussie-redneck, Sigourney Weaver is massively underutilised, Patel is solid and Copley is great as the South African-accented voice of Chappie, providing most of the laughs due to his interpretation of sayings.The visual effects - particularly of Chappie and the other scouts - is superb. There's not too much philosophising on the impacts AI could have on humans/the world. The ending was a little drawn-out and obvious - not necessarily good or bad."
" New & Bold - critics and tightwads can't relate
",2017-12-20 00:00:00,10,Everyone of the bad reviews are from people that are like the CEO that Sigourney Weaver plays in this movie.. screw them and enjoy this movie. Those people want all the bad people to act like the Rock or some crappy approved stereotype.People who hate this movie are the same people that wear the same clothes their bosses wear and loathe anyone that comes in with any original style.How dare they! There was no memo sent out that says we are allowed to like and enjoy Die Antwoord!! So we must trash them!!The movie is top notch and a lot of fun which is what all these people are so bent out about.. they are seeing people having fun and being free and they HATE that since they gave that up long ago and this reminds them painfully how tightwadded their lives are nowThis movie is priceless and will be watched over and over decades from now
" Blomkamp delivers more smart sci-fi, but this time with more heart
",2017-12-10 00:00:00,7,"Another smart science fiction film from writer/director Neill Blomkamp (""District 9"" and ""Elysium""). This story is set in Blomkamp's home country of South Africa, where the story has police forces now primarily consisting of new robotic police officers built by a private contractor. The scientist behind the robots wants to further his research by improving the artificial intelligence of his creation, essentially creating a super smart self aware child that he can teach. The company president, Sigourney Weaver, doesn't like the project so the scientist decides to run his experiment off-site with stolen parts, except that he's highjacked by a street gang who force him to build his robot and then raise the child-like robot to be a gansta super criminal. Much like Blomkamp's other films, this one has a clever and original story premise, but takes it much deeper. The film on the surface is an action packed story of corporate greed and the moral/ethical implications of AI, but ""Chappie"" has a much deeper subtext beyond that. At it's core, it's a story of nature vs. nurture and hooks the audience on a human level, particularly for anyone who's every raised a child. The responsibility and the decisions one has to make in how you want your child to view the world are immediately identifiable to any parent watching this film. Where the film falters is a subplot involving a competing scientist at the same company, played by Hugh Jackman, who wants to sabotage the police robot program to swing Weaver's support for his more tank-like security droid. That part of the story felt like a retread of the Robocop vs. ED 209 plot line from ""Robocop"" and was nowhere as interesting as the more human of drama happening around the raising of this childlike robot. Overall, despite it's flaws, ""Chappie"" works on a simple entertainment level, but also works on an intellectual level if you're looking for something smarter than your average sci-fi summer blockbuster."
" An Adorable RoboCop
",2017-11-30 00:00:00,6,"(Flash Review)I primarily chose to watch this for the Hans Zimmer soundtrack, which did not disappoint and energized many scenes. This movie attempts to portray the meaning of life by personifying a robot with artificial intelligence installed and a friendly voice. Chappie was part of a robotic police department in a gloomy future. He was badly damaged in a battle and marked for destruction. An AI engineer recovers the robot and installs his AI prototype software into it. Later kidnapped by hoodlums, Chappie is being taught wrong morals in the mean streets. Will he get rescued by his 'maker', will he be trained to do the bidding of violent thieves or learn to stand up to them? A couple messages of the movie are that humans can be very bad life forms as this learning Chappie AI is more selfless than many real humans and also how easy it can be to corrupt innocent people. Overall, the movie's tone was awkward as it was an odd mix of happy moments are rather bloody violence. Arguably a few plot holes or strange character decisions but it did a great job at giving a grubby robot a wide spectrum of real emotions."
" ""Chappie""- Almost a great film. Almost. Worth seeing for all it does right despite its many faults.
",2017-11-22 00:00:00,7,"It might seem almost paradoxical, but I found myself quite taken by the bulk of the film ""Chappie"" despite the fact that honestly... it's a pretty wonky film when viewed as a whole. Director Neill Blomkamp's tale of artificial intelligence and criminal corruption was a peculiar release in 2015 that garnered a generally mixed response from both critics and audiences alike. Some applauded it for asking big questions and delving into a classic morality tale of what constitutes life and purpose. Others despised it for its unlikable characters and messy narrative structure. And me? Well, I'm somewhere in the middle. Able to recognize and condemn its faults while still finding great value in the elements and aspects of the story that do work.In the not too distant future, robotics and programming expert Deon Wilson (Dev Patel) has helped to create the ""Scouts""- robotic police androids that are licensed out to help take back the streets of Johannesburg from criminals and gangsters. One day, Deon secretly steals a damaged Scout body to use as a guinea-pig for an Artificial Intelligence experiment... only to be kidnapped by a group of common street-thugs (Ninja and Yolandi of the rap-group ""Die Antwoord"", Jose Pablo Cantillo) who wish to use the robot to pull heists and make dirty money. Dubbed ""Chappie"", the ""newborn"" AI operates on the same level as a young child, and is pulled between his decent creator and his violent ""adoptive family."" At the same time, Deon's work rival Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) learns of Chappie's existence and, viewing him as an ungodly creation, vows to destroy him along with the other Scouts in order to push forward his own robotic-police units...In many ways, ""Chappie"" is a frustrating watch because it's almost a great film... but it's not quite there. It's an almost perfect inversion of that old saying ""The whole is greater than the sum of the parts."" All of the individual elements at play in ""Chappie"" are engrossing, compelling and incredibly enjoyable. But it doesn't exactly come together. The film's biggest fault is the fact that the writing feels rushed and patched together- like Blomkamp and co-writer Terri Tatchell had a lot of brilliant ideas for different parts of the story, but couldn't quite fit them together and rushed into production without a completed script. The pacing is weird, there's some bizarre inconsistencies in the structure, and just a few too many moments of convenience and coincidence. It needed another draft, plain and simple.And that should be the kiss of death... but it's not. Because everything else works so well, that I found myself very willing to forgive the troubled writing and shaky foundation. The story has some clever ideas and heady themes that I found fascinating, and I loved the fact that Blomkamp and Tatchell allow the movie to operate in a morally grey zone- they raise questions, but often leave the answers up to the audience's interpretation. As always, Blomkamp's visual direction is a phenomena, and his sense of scope, composition and color is just awe-inspiring. His films always have a unique balance between gritty realism and melodramatic hyper-reality, and he nails that in ""Chappie"" in the best of ways. And I found all of the characters quite compelling in their own ways. Heck, you might very well find yourself growing attached to the robotic Chappie and the criminals who are ""raising"" him more than the other, much more human and humane characters.This is aided by surprisingly solid performances from basically involved. Patel is a joy as always, and it's great seeing him on- screen once again. Jackman is a delightfully slimy villain who seems to be having a blast chewing the scenery. And heck... I even though Ninja and Yolandi of Die Antwoord did pretty darned good. Particularly Yolandi, whom grows close to Chappie and begins to mother and nurture him in a genuinely loving way- forming the film's strongest emotional through-line. But of course, the incredible Sharlto Copley shines through as the voice of the titular Chappie. Copley might not be a household name, but he's quickly become one of my favorite actors working today with his incredible turns in films including Blomkamp's own ""District 9"" and the underrated ""A-Team"" feature film. And his wondrous and childlike take on the character of Chappie is another strong win for Copley.At the end of the day, it comes down to this. ""Chappie"" is almost a great film. But it's not. It's messy. It's uneven. And it has a ton of problems. And yet... I feel that it does enough right to be worth checking out. It has interesting themes, plenty of entertainment value, a beautiful scope and fine performances. And to me, that makes up for most of the problems I have with the shoddy writing. I'm giving ""Chappie"" a pretty-good 7 out of 10. Give it a shot. You might like it."
" You think you're real?
",2017-11-19 00:00:00,9,"A wonderful movie about humanity and what we define as existence. The movie is placed in 2016, South Africa as crime has increased a local weapons manufacturer replaces the human police enforcers with droids. However the lead designer of these droids is working on making sentient AI program. After being turned down by his supervisor, he proceeds on his own and his work abducted during a car jacking.Chappie has some comical real world elements, but is a very serious look at human nature. It shows there is no true line between what we call good and evil. It questions the meaning of existence and explores the definition of the soul. Most characters are all motivated by impending death, either physical or financial, and sometimes both. All the work on this film was done with excellent care to details. The dialog, the acting, the effects, and direction are all great work. My only complaint would be the blurb at the beginning of the film talking about events ahead of the movie was nonessential. If you skip to the CNN anchor talking, it would have been a 10/10. So 1 point for editing?Action packed and an ending that has you begging for a sequel."
" Great Looking Movie, Everything Else Stunk
",2017-11-10 00:00:00,4,"4/10. It would be much lower if it wasn't so beautifully shot, colorful, and uniquely stylish.I just watched this on Netflix, and it's one of those movies I'm so grateful I didn't pay to see in the theater, but wasn't terribly let down watching it on my couch over the course of 3 days.People complain about the acting by the South African rappers, but I didn't think they were any worse than Dev, Hugh, or Sigourney. And when good actors fall as flat as these performances did, you can typically blame the writing and/or directing.This screenplay was hard to swallow. The director gives the audience no credit as the plot is meticulously spelled out in large bold print. Unfathomable motivations drive main characters to behave in ways that only make sense on the back of a hastily scribbled napkin. Chappie has lofty expectations and it felt lacking as it blew into city-wide catastrophe scale."
" Bad Robocop ripoff in the beginning and stupid coming to age robot story second *SPOILERS*.
",2017-10-16 00:00:00,1,Wow is this film bad and I'm someone who doesn't usually listen to critics but dang is this bad first it's kinda a reverse Robocop ripoff the robot get's blown up by a bazooka and the creator of the robot rebuilds him and tries to sell it to the military thy don't take and the film just copy and paste the ED- 209 and oh my god what they did in the second act was even worse which was trying to do a robot coming of age story because the robot becomes retarded after being blown up and the creator gives him to this gang/band who raise him into being a gang member and he imprints on the female gang member and thinking of her as a mother it's dumb and in the final act the bootleg ED-209 has a battle with the robot and the gang/band some people die and the robot's mommy dies and he blows up the bootleg ED-209 he turns some guy into a robot and then turns his mommy into a robot it's weird and bad so if you're going to watch this just keep in mind don't take it seriously or you'll have a head ache trying to understand this movies logic. P.S. if this sounds like a rant to you I'm sorry I just think this movie is bad .
" Basic but fun
",2017-10-07 00:00:00,6,"Johannesburg, South Africa. In order to curb the high crime rate the police use robots to fight crime. This is an immediate success and the police order several more robots from the developer, Tetravaal. After falling foul of these robots, two criminals, Ninja and Yolandi, kidnap Tetravaal's chief engineer, and genius behind the robots, Deon Wilson, with the aim of getting him to deactivate them. To their surprise he is transporting one of the robots, Scout 22, as he is working on a personal project to give robots consciousness. Ninja and Yolandi see the opportunity to have a robot on their side and immediately set about attempting to train the robot to help them in their criminal activities. They also give him a name - Chappie.Okay, fun movie from writer-director Neil Blomkamp. Not anywhere up to the standard of Blomkamp's brilliant debut movie, District 9, but it'll do (and it is heaps better than Blomkamp's second movie, the weak, irritating Elysium). Pretty basic plot with low production values and a hammy clumsiness to it all, yet it is fairly entertaining. Maybe it is the crudeness of it all that makes it likable, as it is difficult to take too seriously. Add in two of the most colourful criminals of all time - Ninja and Yolandi, played by the members of South African rap band Die Antwoord, and it is a rollicking ride.Does get a bit silly towards the end as the capers get to be like a common-or-garden action movie. Also loses its lightness as Blomkamp tries to be serious and inject some philosophy and emotion into the movie, and this is out of place and half-baked.Overall, hardly Citizen Kane but reasonably entertaining."
" Not bad, but...
",2017-10-07 00:00:00,7,"... also not fantastic.I absolutely loved Neil Blomkamp's first film, District 9, enough to have at least some interest in whatever he ended up making next. Elysium I thought was good but also a step down from District 9 in terms of quality, and now Chappie, in my opinion, is probably another slight step down from that.In fact, it was this movie's fairly poor critical response that put me off seeing it until now. Never caught it at the cinema, fearing it'd be a waste of time and an expensive movie ticket. However, I do feel somewhat stupid about this now that I've actually watched the movie, and found it largely enjoyable. Not a great film, mind you, as there are a few too many flaws here for it to reach the standards of a genuine sci-fi classic like District 9.The writing was a little clunky at times, there were some strange plot conveniences here and there, the dialogue was a little hit and miss, and I wasn't really sure that the members of the rap group Die Antwoord were well suited to acting (never listened to their music, but I don't think acting's their strong suite). On the topic of acting, most of the rest of the cast were pretty decent. Hugh Jackman's definitely been better, but he did an okay job considering he was playing a relatively straightforward villainous role. Sigourney Weaver was kinda underused, but generally fine, while Dev Patel did a good job at playing the lead 'human' character. And Sharlto Copley was really good as the voice of Chappie- his delivery was all around pretty great, and really helped make the title character sympathetic, charismatic, and likable.There's a few decent action scenes, some funny moments and lines here and there, and overall, the film moves at a good pace throughout, never feeling boring. But there's certainly less substance and food for thought here than I'm used to seeing in a Neil Blomkamp film, even if there's a good deal of style, with the film being generally well-shot and nice to look at. It's pretty good entertainment, and a nice way to kill a couple of hours, but there's a few too many problems scattered throughout to make it a great film, as well as being a little shallower than I was expecting. I doubt it'll stick with me, but I certainly don't regret watching it."
" Copy
",2017-09-21 00:00:00,1,"This is a copy of overall concept of a movie called Short Circuit, from the 1980's. This one is much worse of course and set in a place I have no interest in: South Africa, with very unattractive sounding accents and unappealing characters at every turn. The robot is rather annoying to put it lightly. I don't care one bit about this stupid thing. The voice sounds stupid, the mannerisms are annoying and I never a all sorry for it or care about it winning anything. Who gave this guy $49,000,000???"
" This is truly horrible.
",2017-09-03 00:00:00,1,"If a movie wanted to explore the moral issues this movie tried to tackle, I would have preferred that it at least approached the subject with thought, and in a somewhat plausible manner.I am honestly struggling to think of a movie I have seen in the last 5 years that is worse than this. It ranks right up there with the worst movies I have ever seen.It might have been almost tolerable if it was billed as a comedy."
" Tired of waiting...
",2017-08-29 00:00:00,4,"No, I didn't like District 9...No, I didn't like Elysium, even though it did have a very few good points...But, I am still waiting for some good movie to come out of South Africa. This ain't it...For whoever the Director is, I know you like the Mad Max and Road Warrior style of movie making, but why do you have to try to remake those cult classics in the first place...? And why go out of your way to find the most down on their luck South Africans to tell a story...And why on Earth tell such an abysmal story, with no real plot at all...There's my review..."
" A cool robot is in town!
",2017-08-28 00:00:00,8,"This film has many aspects that I liked. The whole discussion about soul and consciousness and whether a robot could possess them, the idea that criminals might have positive and negative sides, the truths exposed of greedy motives for decisions made by individuals and company directors. Chappie starts as your run of the mill robot, but under training of a few questionable individuals, gets his groove on mid film, and then some serious hip robot moves are happening from there. I loved the sauntering swearing robot scenes. And the decisions about sacrifice for others or the greater good were fascinating too. A good film to see. Lots of coarse language, yet a great morality tale."
" Neil Blomkamp's worst film by far
",2017-08-16 00:00:00,3,"Neil Blomkamp is one of my favourite directors, he has never made a film I have not absolutely loved, until I watched Chappie. I hate the idea of sentient AI, I hate the theory in real life and the theme in fiction, this is from someone who codes for a living, I can tell you this can never happen no matter how hard you try. But that isn't the main reason I didn't like this film at all. It's the ending, not only did Chappie somehow use a helmet to detect neural brainwaves, even though he has no organic brain, but his Creator used it to literally transfer his consciousness into a robot's body. There is no explanation in the film of how this works, and in real life it you would have more or a chance of transferring your contentiousness to a machine by banging your head against it.I ending hits especially hard if you consider Neil Blomkamp's other works. In all of Blomkamp's films he keeps the ""Fi"" in ""Sci-Fi"" to a minimum, he used things that could be possible, or improved versions of existing things, and if something does not exist, he finds a way of making it damn cool and unique. The start of this film does just that, it looks believable and extremely cool at the same time. But half an hour into the film this dies, the film becomes extremely boring and less and less believable. I find none of the characters believable or likable except Huge Jackman's character, of whom I felt myself rooting for by the end.This is by far Blomkamp's worst film, on a technical level and compared to his other films, this film is garbage. It was boring, stupid, unbelievable and was filled with countless obvious plot hols. If you are a fan of Blomkamp's or with grounded Sci-Fi in general, do yourself a favour and give this film a miss, it will do nothing for you. If you are into action, then the first 20 minutes or so is interesting, but the other hour and 40 minutes are a complete drag."
" An awful representation of AI
",2017-08-10 00:00:00,4,"In a futuristic South Africa, where the police force has been replaced with titanium, autonomous robots, one of them receives consciousness, thus starting to act like a human. Unfortunately, the entourage in which he is ""born"" is not very normal or pleasant so he will soon begin to inherit bad habits, while his maker continuously tries to teach him good. Although having a very good idea, this movie turned out to be a terrible example of how to not make a film. The story is linear, predictable, boring and truly stupid. The whole plot is in fact stupid, filled with dull, unsympathetic and even idiotic characters, who actually make this technological wonder look really bad. Furthermore, the whole movie is filled with plot holes, inconsistencies and even inexplicable events which absolutely ruin the overall experience. You cannot tell people that you can simply steal a robot, be it ready for disposal, from a state of the art facility without anyone noticing or even asking a question, while at the same time ""borrowing"" the security master key for two full days until someone actually raises an eyebrow. It's ridiculous and absurd, not to say the fact that the movie bases its entire action on a robot with a conscience which ends up getting raised by drug dealers, who simply act like retarded monkeys. Couldn't they have come with something which is not completely stupid and somehow end up with something even remotely interesting? Or at least not as insulting... And to think that they had two great actors which ended up with bad side characters which couldn't do anything to salvage this sinking ship. Oh, and to add the cherry on top of the cake, the finale is in tone with the rest of the movie, being unsatisfying, inconclusive and even dumb.Overall, it's another movie which had a good premise but somehow managed to turn it into such a bad movie as this one is. I can only advise anyone to stay as far away as they can from this..."
" Nicely done
",2017-08-09 00:00:00,8,"Not typically a fan of si-fi as they can become unwatchable(Indiana Jones: Crystal Skull), however this was an impressive film. I personally would have enjoyed a different set of characters instead of Ninja's gang but maybe that's just me. The movie has many underlying themes which I feel is very common from movies outside of America. You can see the lengths people will go just to get what they want whether it be right or wrong. Don't let the bad reviews push you away from this film as I can understand why some people might have trouble following the plot. I have noticed some reviews actually have their characters mixed up and that does not surprise me. Keep in mind that films outside of the US normally take more critical thinking as everything is not spoon fed to you. The film may not be for the uneducated."
" A film in which none of the mains can act
",2017-07-16 00:00:00,5,"This is not meant to be a proper review but it has gotta be said...I like Neill's work, but seriously... Next time Neill, don't cast 'rappers' as your main roles just because they're a fan of your work.Other than the hammy performance and at times ropey dialogue, the film is watchable and enjoyable if you can get past the terrible acting. I will say Chappie is certainly an improvement over Elysium which in all honesty, was pretty bad."
" This is not your cutesy American sentient robot movie
",2017-07-14 00:00:00,8,"This South African movie is a gritty, violent, funny and heart-touching blend of Robocop and Short Circuit. Believe it or not.The setup is standard: armies of robot police 'scouts' are on the streets, assisting the human police to keep order. There's an earnest, well-meaning robotics whiz who wants to give the scouts more heart. A heartless CEO whose only focus is maximizing profits. A rival robotics engineer hoping to replace the scouts with his steroidal variant. Assorted thugs, mugs, goons, and ne-er-do-wells. And one robot wakes up.After that, it all gets weird.The script is slick, the acting delightful, especially Dev Patel, who pretty much carries it for the human side despite Sigourney Weaver getting higher billing. Unknown-to-me Sharlto Copley infuses the sentient scout, 22, with a winning personality. The filming is competent, though not inspired. Johannesburg is a dystopian character in its own right.Well worth a Saturday evening."
" Loved this, shocked at the low score!
",2017-07-13 00:00:00,9,"Here we have another successful film by writer/director Neill Blomkamp. I think this is my first sci-fi/comedy, and funny it sure was.Aside from an excellent script and the amazing directing, the cinematography, VFX and editing were outstanding. The main cast - Sharlto Copley, Dev Patel and Hugh Jackman were on point in their characters. My only complaint was the punk-rockers (actually a real-life successful band) cast in this film. I didn't feel the need for their characters. Had they been replaced by more appealing and appropriate characters, this film would have been a 10/10. But for that reason, it came down to a 9/10.Truly an enjoyable film that I've seen many times over, and still get entertained each time."
" Chappie was a good film with some minor flaws, but its story and deep concepts ultimately saves it from utter destruction.
",2017-07-11 00:00:00,7,"Chappie was a good film with some minor flaws, but its story and deep concepts ultimately saves it from utter destruction. The fast paced opener and mediocre acting definitely keep this film from a ""Very Good"", but in the end I decided to give Chappie a ""Good"" on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10. This was a film I really wanted to be better, but ultimately failed where you really didn't want it to. So with that I guess this film made the correct decision on its name since Chappie is the best part about Chappie.Read more at theVade."
" Wonderfully horrible really terrible
",2017-06-22 00:00:00,8,"****** Warning Spoilers *******I love bad movies and this one was a real treat. This is the first movie I have ever watched that I was really hoping all of the main characters would fail horribly and die so that none of their plans could be brought to fruition. Huge Jackman is the antagonist.... kinda. I was rooting for him to succeed more often then not, he has a few moments when he seems to suffer from PTSD that make you think oh I guess he is supposed to be the bag guy. Chappie oh Chappie, I usually don't notice when a character is being used to fill a stereotype but this was pretty undeniable. The way this Robot.... oh words fail to come to mind that can describe him. I felt that he ""might"" have been used to portray a Mexican stereotype, just maybe. I found it really racist, and I hope that the director was doing it that way, so that when I laughed I knew without a doubt I am a broken and horrible human who needs to take I extra long look at myself crying into a bucket of ice cream. You would figure they would have just used a South African stereotype for Chappie. Then again they might have a lot of stereotypical Mexicans in South Africa, I have not been there so I do not know. The main Doctor was crazy at one point he threatens another character by saying he would report him. I had to pause the movie at that point and contemplate how stupid he would have to be to even consider doing that. It took me ten minutes before my laughing subsided. My mind was blown. If he would have done that at that point the other guy would have received a possible slap on the wrist. Where on the other had the Dr would have potentially been put in a windowless room deep underground so they could still force him to make creations but never allow him to see the light of day. The ""mom"" and ""dad"" once again gloriously horrible creatures that made me wonder if they could possibly exist. That though robbed me of sleep for a week. This movie is absolutely a treasure of terribleness I loved/hated every last minute of this.Do I recommend this movie? No, oh god no that would make me a horrible person. Hum.... I guess I kinda am in a way so I guess I do recommend this movie. You have been warned so enjoy."
" man bequeaths machine, machine grasps consciousness, reproduces
",2017-06-18 00:00:00,9,"What is consciousness? Yes that is the right question. Chappie gives new meaning to 'thugs life' the humanity behind the inhumanity and expands the definition for all. The questions this leaves us with are varied and take paths that future generations will comprehend. Today and in this movie we understand compassion, greed, war, competition in the depiction of humanity the good the bad and the ugly. Will we be the ones to evolve past what we are today or will that torch pass to what/who we create, has this happened before...The acting was great and my favorite similarity to that of a book, it let's what is left unsaid be the rich imaginary backdrop to a simple story."
" Interesting though could have been better
",2017-06-12 00:00:00,5,"Chappie is another futuristic robotic action film by director Neill Blomkamp. Having received success and amounts of praise from his first major studio film District 9, then mild reviews and success from his follow up Elysium, more pressure appeared on his radar for his third film Chappie. This film is not on the level of District 9 nor is better than Elysium as both those films were more intriguing, entertaining and better story telling. Chappie is a decent film as it is entertaining at some scenes, though the film is mild disappointing as it isn't as funny or action packed as it appeared to be, and it's climax is not as great as it could have been. Hugh Jackman appears to be wasted in an odd portrayal as the lead villain, where his character did not appear to have an amount of screen time as intended. Neill Blomkamp has clear and very intriguing overall ideas, though many of them do not come out as planned."
" This is a movie that follows Chappie, a robot previously used on the police force, as he is given a new intelligence that can think and create for itself.
",2017-06-09 00:00:00,6,"Chappie is a scout robot from the police force who has experienced damage beyond repair. Before destruction, his creator, Deon Wilson, wishes to run an experiment on him by installing an intelligence that thinks, learns, and designs. However, when this falls into the hands of a street gang, Chappie must learn to chose his own right and wrong as he hears the conflicting views of Deon and the various gang members. This is where the movie truly shines. It creates a setting that makes viewers question their own morals and cheer for Chappie as he strives for a moral life. For the most part, this was a movie that focused on emotion instead of computerized action, and I loved that about it. However, without giving anything away, I can say that the ending did not leave me feeling as though the movie was complete. I found myself wanting certain scenes relating to Chappie's imagination to last longer, while wanting less scenes relating to the gang members' lives. I also believe that certain characters were far from well developed, while some were completely unnecessary. I believe this movie could have added time to its run time without dragging out the plot and still allowing characters to be well-developed. In summary, Chappie gives its audiences much to consider, yet it finds itself suffering from a variety of flaws. However, having said all of this, it was not a bad movie, it was simply less than what it could have been. I hope I can see more movies such as this that strive for great depth."

The movie's visuals were amazing, the character development was EXCELLENT and the movie was funny, sad, and action packed! In my opinion, this is what every movie needs, I rate this a 9/10 (just because I didn't like the side gangsters that wanted money from the main gangsters *when you watch the movie it will make sense, trust me*)"
" Interesting and entertaining
",2017-06-03 00:00:00,7,Quite an interesting movie. It explores deep and serious existentialist questions about the human condition in a playful and entertaining way. It would be a mistake to think this movie is all about cops and robbers even thought the special effects and action scenes are quite good.This is a movie I would highly recommend.
" A society in the future is protected by robots.

An advanced humanoid with Artificial Intelligence is stolen quickly after his creation. He is named Chappie and is caught up in a battle between the inept criminals, who snatched him, and the money-hungry weapons developer that created him.Some impeccable visual effects and a plot that slow drips social commentary. Can easily grab attention of high school kids, but will probably patronize or insult the adult viewer. There is some intrigue at first, but can't find fault with someone discovering stupidity. CHAPPIE is a fun watch.Cast includes: Dev Patel, Yo-Landi Visser, Jose Pablo Cantillo, Sigourney Weaver, Hugh Jackman, Maurice Carpede, Brandon Auret and Sharlto Copley as Chappie."
" This could have been the perfect ""10"".
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,7,"This was basically a ""Feel Good"" Movie, although a mish mash of Short Circuit, Robocop, District 9 and I Robot. In effect, a rip-off, knock- off, and unoriginal movie. I still liked it, but it could have been so much more if they had left out the bulbous looking robot from Robocop, and created a new story line. Also worthy of mention here is that using Hugh Jackman as the crazy and eccentric madman, was quite possibly counter productive for his professional career, and he'll certainly be feeling the backlash for this for years to come."
" Emotional Robots

But, don't be confused the movie is fun and really fun.Worthy too watch."
" Great theme underrated by critic concerned with perfection.
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,7,"This movie is a critics nightmare. Involving important concepts which they think they know about. A brave attempt by the director/writer Neill Blomkamp. His style so anti Hollywood executive but plenty gun action to keep them happy. This delightful movie definitely could be better or a lot worse, they still had ""Y"" Hollywood computer button. Two of the minor characters were interesting and deserve credit. The script could of been better, a little Wes Anderson bizarre , not a bad thing. Starlighting Weaver, Jackman, Patel. They earned their dollars professionally being but out shown by Watkin Tudor Jones and Chappies Mommy . This is no Ex Machina/Terminator but a more realistic view on Asimov AI birth. Understated special effects were superb, such a modern day rarity. These critics however are spoilt from Kramer vs Kramer and 12 Angry Men. Blade Runner the sci-fi (It's science fiction...) yardstick. Those aficionados of Office Space will of course love this."
" Short Circuit meets Robocop!
",2017-03-21 00:00:00,3,"After enjoying the excellent ""District 9""(2009),I was hugely disappointed with ""Elysium""(2013),so I was pretty much up-In-the-air regarding Neill Blomkamps films prior to seeing this further offering from him. Sadly, there Is nothing here we haven't seen before. Little more than an updated remake of ""Short Circuit""(1986) the film nevertheless has It's moments,with plenty of action and explosions(If you like that kind of thing), although the plot Is rather unclear,and It certainly has more than It's share of ""silly science"". As well as the obvious Short Circuit similarities, the nasty executive with his own agenda makes some scenes seem as If they were lifted directly from the first (and quite brilliant for Its time) ""Robocop""(1987), even down to the almost Identical, over-the-top and extra-large Policing unit (called ""ED-209"" In Robocop), so similar In fact that I was surprised that It didn't end up on It's back, squealing and kicking Its legs In frustration and being unable to get back on Its feet! Indeed, take the aspects of the two aforementioned Movies from the plot and we wouldn't have much left! Explaining things, background story for example, seems low on the list In Blomkamps films, so much so that you're left scratching your head long after the end of his movies. Nevertheless, It's an entertaining film which, like Elysium, would no doubt be favoured more by the younger element, although with a (once again) 15 rating, younger children can't (legally)see It (at least, not at the Cinema)! Perhaps Blomkamp should consider, In future, removing some of the violence and bad language to bring down the age rating. Unoriginal and rather silly, but fun for teens."
" End sucks overall good
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,8,A Ai Robot Movie. Hugh Jackman is here in kinda negative role. but Deon Wilson(Dev Patel) made the real AI and put in a robot body he is behaving like a new born child but learning everything very fast as we can expect to a Ai Robot. some gangster using it for bad works but in this way he is learning fast. there is hundreds of Robot cops all over the city protecting people chasing for crimes. story is just ordinary however i don't like the movie just because the end he transfer a human body to a robot technology is not developed like this and this just doesn't make any sense too ends sucks overall just ordinary movie i don't find much interest in it as a Ai movie just fine Ai movie. IMDb 6.9
" Low expectations may be why I love this film so much.
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,9,"I did not care for any of the hype when this film was released. I initially wrote it off as another Hollywood re-do of one of my favorite childhood films, this time being Short Circuit. I refused to see it at the theater, and I regret that decision now. Since then I have watched it at least a dozen times. I'll try to keep spoilers to a minimum as I elaborate on why I love this film.The world of Chappie is very much like our own, though slightly more dystopian. Violent crime has ravaged Johannesburg to a point that police forces are unable to combat street gangs and an ever revolving door of drug lords. Enter Deon Wilson. A genius engineer / programmer that has designed a V.I. (Virtual Intelligence) controlled robotic police force used for heavy suppression of violent crime. (A Robotic SWAT team if you will.) These machines are able to take back the city almost overnight, and with far less collateral damage than a full military force could hope to do. This success sets Deon up as the savior of the city from the viewpoint of law enforcement. However Deon's end goal was never V.I., as he has somewhat of a GOD complex. To Deon, V.I. is just a stepping stone to a true A.I. capable of independent thought.Obviously, Deon is able to create a stable A.I. but does not have the patience to test it in an appropriate manner. His excitement gets the best of him, and he decides to install his A.I. in a damaged, and irreparable police drone. Chappie is then born with a blank slate, and this makes him incredibly human. There is very much a coming of age story, though at a highly accelerated pace because of how fast Chappie is able to learn. (Especially once he accesses the internet.) To go further in detail would end up short selling the dramatic elements within the film, but I can wholeheartedly say that Neill Blomkamp managed to take everything great about Short Circuit, and create a completely unique (and adult) story that is easy to accept, and well explained. The movie is violent, crude, and often hilarious. I risked breaking the re-wind function on my laptop the first time I heard Chappie call a woman a ""slut"" while car-jacking her. The acting is great throughout particularly by Hugh Jackman who plays Vincent Moore, an engineer with a GOD complex that is a stark contrast to Deon's. Moore aspires to be a Zeus-type GOD, relishing destruction over creation. Ninja and Yo-Landi of Die Antwoord are surprisingly good in the film as well. The CGI is spectacular. Take notes Lucasfilm...There are shortcomings in the film that are more annoyances than anything. Jose Pablo Cantillo's character Amerika is a total ""Vato"" stereotype, and a terrible one at that. It felt very forced, dishonest, and frankly unnecessary. He would have been a fine cast, if he had played a character closer to his SOA role as Hector Salazar. They could have edited his character out of the film completely, and it would have been better. The ""Vato loco ese"" base was all wrong. Cantillo is a much better actor than that. It would have been the same as seeing Mekhi Phifer acting like DMX. Grrrr ARF! ARF!The whole introduction of the film showing different talking-head opinions on Chappie and Deon are completely lost in the film, UNLESS you watch the alternate ending which is much darker (and better IMO) than the theatrical ending. I could have completely done without this introduction though, as it seemed to be pulled directly from District 9. Yes, same writers / director, but it's a trite way to build interest and curiosity. In fact, the ONLY reason it was acceptable in D9, was because of the ""Documentary"" style filming. Chappie was not shot the same, and shouldn't have been introduced as such.Chappie refers to himself in the 3rd person. It's cute, but actually makes him seem less-human since this is a completely unnatural way to speak.The Crime-Lord Hippo is WAY over the top. Not at all a bad performance or unfitting for the film, just a little extravagant for someone who has reached the top of the criminal food-chain. You just couldn't be that outlandish and not be locked up or killed by the authorities, even if they are completely overwhelmed.Whatever drug Ninja, Yo-Landi and Amerika are pushing, looks like moth balls. Seems like it would have been less effort and more believable to fill little baggies with baking powder. I'm nit-picking at this point, but it's weird.I expected this movie to p!ss me off, but instead it's become one of my all time favorites. Even if you end up disagreeing with me, it's definitely worth watching. As far as Blomkamp's works go, I say it's better than District 9, and on par or slightly better than Elysium. That's a tough call."
" Give it a chance, I'm glad that I did
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,8,"To set the scene about my review on this film, I do have to provide a little bit of context. District 9 is one of my favourite films. The way it made me feel when I saw it, the wonder of the effects, the performances of those involved, the involving story that it told and the brilliance of the makers (Blomkamp and co) who burst onto the scene with this first film. I was awed and I lapped the film up. When Elysium was due to come out, I avoided all trailers and descriptions of the films. I had bundles of confidence in Neill and his team and wanted to enter the cinema as 'innocent' to the story as I had with D9.However, I was crushed by Elysium. It felt so weak, so hackneyed, so overplayed and so preachy. Big money had got involved, big stars had signed up and it felt like the creativity and wonder of the team had been bloated and corrupted by the studios offering Neill a blank cheque to do what he wanted. I was so disappointed. I couldn't even take comfort that Elysium might be a flash in the plan as a little research after the film revealed that the next film would be Chappie – what a stupid name I thought. And whereas with Elysium I gave myself an information ban, on Chappie I did the opposite. As you well know the reviews were scathing, the trailers gave conflicting interpretations of what the film was and the haircuts looked ridiculous. More review reading, more IMDb message board surfing and more research into the unlikeable characters and a head of negative steam built up against the film, that couldn't be over turned. I still loved D9 but even that wasn't strong enough to give me the confidence in Neill and go to see the film.Fast forward to a week ago and I receive an offer to have Sky movies as part of my existing Virgin package. I come home that night and start trawling through the available films to throw some bits in the watch later list and I notice Chappie. My interest is piqued out of morbid curiosity but I have no intention of making it a tent pole weekend film. It's a Wednesday night around about midnight and with work the next day, I decide to give it half an hour with the knowledge that if it's crap I can switch off and hit the sack.Well the music got me first. It was wonderful and had a great 80's Tron vibe to it. I am a big fan on Jean Michel Jarre and Tangerine Dream and the music had welcome nods to those artists. The story felt a little clichéd, the haircuts looked laughable and the characters of Ninja and Yolandi flat out annoying. But it began to get under my skin. My brain was stimulated and in the early hours of a work night, I was wide awake.Maybe I'm a sentimental old fool but I didn't like the harsh treatment that the innocent Chappie was receiving though looking back I understand that it was a tool to make me empathise with his plight and cement a connection to his character.Two thirds of the way through and I was hooked. I was invested in Chappie. Ninja and Yolandi were mellowing (or at least becoming more likable) and I was on board with the story and wondering what would happen. Yes it has nods towards Short Circuit and Robocop and any other sentient robot film but that doesn't mean that it doesn't have its own story to tell.The final battle in the disused factory, whilst not as good as the epic fight in D9, had me on the edge of the seat and the brutal actions scenes and swelling score were a tour de force. By the last 15 minutes, I was willing Chappie to make it and worried his power would run out or be captured. The resolution to his and Deon's problem was wonderfully original and I let the whole credits roll as a mark of respect for my enjoyment and to hear as much of the soundtrack as I could.I watched the film again three days later and enjoyed it even more, picking up on more of the subtleties of Copley's physical movement and some of the other musical cues. I'm going to purchase the Blu Ray as I feel I owe it to the makers and it's worthy of being in my collection. I feel bad for not showing faith in the director and listening to the critics and reviews but Elysium was such a disappointment that I guess I couldn't look beyond it. On the upside though, I got a really nice surprise of seeing a cracking, entertaining film on my own and when I least expected it."
" Failed by plot
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,4,"Wow just watched Chappie, it looked AMAZING, pretty good dialogue, great FX, cool to see Ninja and Yolandi on the big screen, but what about that plot?? It was retarded, Short Circuit deals way better with similar themes and that's a blinking kids movie. OK Chappie started well but then all this mummy/daddy bollix got annoying. Instead of wasting so much time faffing, Jackman and Weaver could have been given space to make their characters less one- dimensional. By the end I didn't really care any more, as mentioned here on the message boards (RiP) it for sure would have been easier to hack a power source than transfer bodies. Better movies about AI: Short Circuit (seriously, watch it again!) / Automata / Blade Runner (of course)"
" 8 out of 10 kinda deal but rounding up to offset the ravers
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,10,"This is my second time watching this film; the first time being when it came out. That right there tells you something, it's good. This is the third in the Neil Blomkamp ""future trilogy"", and possibly the best depending on your tastes. I think this is my favorite, Elysium would have been my favorite if it wasn't for the horrible acting from the mother/girlfriend opposite Matt Damon. Anyway, I digress. This film is set in a not too distant future and is about a lone engineer who wrote a program for artificial intelligence and puts it into the body of a damaged humanoid police drone in the backset of being held in the custody of a few lifetime criminals. This film is a masterpiece. People like to complain about the acting by the South African rappers Blomkamp put in the lead roles, they basically play themselves; in other words they nail it. The only minor complaint I have is they overuse the rap couple's music a little too much. Anyway, the ending takes a twisted and uncomfortable turn. I don't agree with the moral ramifications of uploading your consciousness into a computer for the purpose of living forever but the question needs to be asked. Because there are some freaks out there pushing for this kind of stuff and it is scary. Just imagine a dictator doing this and living forever and causing pain and misery for hundreds of years. Scary times ahead, ha. Anyway this is a great film. It also covers the topic of nature vs nurture. And a bunch of other things. Many people hate on this film because they do not agree with the themes. Regardless, the film is interesting, paced very well and above all it is entertaining. I highly recommend this film. Sci-fi at its best."
" Piece of crap, but it didn't have to be.
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,4,"The movie premise is quite interesting and this movie could have been truly great. Both District 9 and Elysium had a gritty dystopian feel to them which I truly liked and Chappie does deliver on that. However, the movie completely falls apart as soon as it becomes the Die Antwoord fanboy movie. My problem is not that I dislike them as actors it's that I dislike them as characters and how pretentious their characters are. As a result that splashes over to Chappie and the movie becomes a self contained circle of self promotion. This movie seems to me like someone had a great idea but decided to pull in Die Antwoord and, being the fanboy that that someone is, designed the plot around the personalities they have established and handed them a promotional opportunity on a silver platter forsaking any believable character or plot developments. Chappie could be such an interesting character and the relation ship between him, Deon, Ninja and Yo-landi could have been so interesting if only Ninja and Yo-landi weren't such crap characters."
" Please ignore the desperate paid positive reviews!
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,1,"Oh my word. This is one of the biggest, steamingest, festering piles of crap I've had the misfortune of sitting through. You'll see the A-list cast and think ""how bad can it be?"" Well...it's as bad as it gets. Did Sigourney and Hugh actually read the script? I doubt it. You know how you hear people say ""it's so bad, it's good?""...not this little clusterf*** of a story. Poorly written, poorly acted, and just plain dopey. I give it one out of ten for the efx, but please, if you're expecting equal or better than 'District 9' save your $$$. You will be disappointed."
" Chappie (2015)
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,7,"Hmmm... Chappie. Yeah I feel conflicted about the movie. I don't love it, but I don't hate it either. The concept is very interesting, but it...stumbles a bit. The film itself doesn't quite match up to the compelling trailer for it and while that necessarily isn't a bad thing, I just think it wasn't as well executed as it could have been. It could have focused more on the advancement of technology and revolting against conformity, and it sort of does but not in the way it would have worked. It mostly centers on a rather likable machine that unfortunately ends up in the hands of some unsavory characters. It's funny that is not touched upon in the trailer whatsoever. In the trailer it looks like a newly created robot who, after much run through, sets out to fight in a war headed by a killing machine. Towards the end I like when the military general Vincent, played by Hugh Jackman, who uses his project Moose to basically lay waste that rundown hideout in order to unfortunately get to Chappie. I didn't really see him as a bad guy. To me he was as ambitious as the high ranking executive who was trying to save Chappie. Well that's my two cents. Perhaps it isn't the most articulate review, and I am in no way trying to bash the movie; I am just mostly in the middle of the road about it. It is an intriguing, thought provoking, heartfelt tale."
" Funny, entertaining and thought-provoking
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,7,"I had a great time watching Chappie, and I thought it was entertaining, light and funny, and gathers the main themes that pervade Blomkamp's filmography.Chappie connects more with District 9 than with Elyseum in themes and format. Like District 9, Chappie starts with a sort of mock newsreel about the amazing development of robotics and how we have gotten to the situation from which the story departs. Like District 9, the end of this film provides a mutation of the main character into something else that is, at the same time, human and not human. Like District 9, there is a reflection on the nature of what makes us human, and how ""humanity"" shows in humans.Some of the more philosophical points are presented in the same light-hearted way. Is having consciousness what makes us human? Or is it a mix of both body and consciousness? If you transplant the consciousness of a human being into a robot, would that robot be able to behave like a human, with feelings, reason and ethical codes? On the other hand, the focus on Chappie's education is not gratuitous, because is queries, albeit hilariously, on what makes us human: is it our consciousness? Our upbringing? The milieu in which we grow up? Our inner compass? Our options in life? Our choices? Our inner programming? Assimov served as choc-chip in a scoop of refreshing ice-cream.I found most actors correct in their respective roles. I was especially surprised by Jackman, an actor I usually don't like, but I thought he was good as the badass Vincent Moore; he should play more baddies! I also liked some of the other baddies, especially the couple of Sudafrican rappers who play ""daddy"" (Ninja), ""mummy"" (Yo-Landi Visser), and of course ""Chappie"" Copley. Sharlto is really a versatile actor, who is believable playing any role you throw at him, and he does a terrific job at infusing Chappie with life and soul.The film does not dig into the nature and motives of all the main characters, except for Chappie. We meet the characters at a certain stage in their lives and we aren't provided with any background, and that is, precisely, the weakest link of the story.I found some of the premises of the movie a homage or retake on the original Robocop, a movie that I watched too many times in the past not to recognize it if it's referenced to. Was that referencing necessary? Well, I don't know. Watch Chappie as a light-hearted science-fiction, as it was intended, and you will enjoy it much more than if you expect a galactic battle or a lecture on philosophical issues revolving robotics. However, you will find that the movie is not only funny, but it also makes some valid points of reflection on those very issues that many people don't see despite having them right in front of the noses. Not the best science-fiction film out there, for sure, but a good one, and one that I truly enjoyed."
" Wasted potential.
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,7,"*Very minor spoilers* The movie ""Chappie"" Is about a super AI. He starts as a baby (In term of intelligence) and grows into adulthood in matter of days. He goes through the human stages really quickly, he learns very quickly, etc. Great actors & acting too. Even ""Die Antwoord"" are acting in this movie!I really hoped the movie will explore Chappie's personality and understanding. Well, in some degree it did, but not enough for my taste. I wanted to see how they explore the brain of an AI once he grew into an adult, how creative the creators of the movie can get on that regard. But alas... I was disappointed. They only partially explored his ""childhood"", if you can call it like that. Still, this movie is pretty good. Sometimes it has some dull & boring scenes, but I think it's because of the cinematography- It was pretty boring. No interesting shots or whatever. I think the cinematography was the biggest let down for me, more than the lack of exploration of Chappie's adulthood.I still would recommend you to watch the movie. It has it's fun and emotional parts."
" Hidden Gem - mistakenly thought this was a kids movie
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,9,"I finally watched CHAPPiE almost 2 tears after it was released when I found out Yo-Landi and Ninja of the band Die Antwoord were in the movie. Other wise I would have never watched, the reason being I mistakenly thought this was a kids movie. BTW There are several Die Antwoord songs in the sound track. For me CHAPPiE turned out to be a fantastic sci-fi action adventure drama. It was written by Neill Blomkamp & Terri Tatchell and directed by Neill Blomkamp, both also did (District 9) and has similar style. If you liked District 9 you will surely enjoy this movie. Its to bad the trailer didn't convey the gist of the movie better because the main thing I remembered was a child like robot scared and cowering behind a rock and what looked like a corporate militia trying to get it back like a different kids movie I didn't like. It makes me wonder how many people had a similar impression and thought this was a kids movie so never watched or how many parents took their kids to see it at the theater or rented the DVD only to realize to late it's not a kids movie and be completely dis- enthralled. In my opinion this is why reviews are all over the place, because so many people came away not seeing what they expected. That's a tragedy because CHAPPiE didn't do well enough for there to be a sequel. This was supposed to be a trilogy and I'm sure there would have been an evolution of characters and added complexity to the sequels."
" Not Believable
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,4,"If you're going into this just hoping for an action movie that you can take away some ideas from, you may be OK. If you're looking at this movie with a critical eye, it's very disappointing.The movie was simply not believable, for a host of reasons. To name a few...-The Moose robot has guns, cluster bombs and anti-aircraft technology.For some inexplicable reason it also has claws for decapitating humans. Why? -The creator of the Moose robot is inexplicably a mass murderer who doesn't seem to fear the fact that he could be held accountable for killing people with his robot. -The firm building the robots has exactly two programmers working on all the robots. Nobody knows what the other hundreds of employees do. -Their security is so lax that one programmer is able to upload a virus to all of the robots and take them offline without anyone knowing that he did it. The other programmer is able to steal a defunct robot and modify it as he sees fit - Again no one notices. -Somehow a helmet used for controlling a robot via a human brain is modified so that people can save their consciousness to a computer? -Uploading one's consciousness inexplicably removes it from the computer/human body that it is presently stored in? Except for when Chappie's mom's consciousness is saved to a flash drive?-A multi billion dollar security firm doesn't have any backups of their robot firmware? They have no contingency plan for when their robots go offline?The lack of scientific / technological understanding is just so bad. The writers clearly either didn't understand, or didn't care about the basics of how computer science works."
