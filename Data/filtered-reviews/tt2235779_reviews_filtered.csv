" lesser known John Pogue project
",2020-12-15 00:00:00,6,"So... at the start, it says Hammer Films.. but of course, they ceased making films around 1980... the name was sold twice, so it's a different group using the name at this point. So professor Coupland (Jared Harris) starts a discussion with his class about religion, beliefs, ethics, studies and states of mind. they choose Jane (Olivia Cooke) to study in depth. but when they put her under the microscope, they may have opened a MUCH bigger can of worms than they imagined. She has much tragedy and troubled darkness inside her, which they may not be able to control. and she channels a spirit ""Evey"", voiced by Caoimhe Judd. but every time they invoke the other world, and ask questions, it seems to blow up in a big, violent mess. you'd think they would take the hint. but they don't. seeing how messed up Jane is, clearly she should be under the care of a psychologist instead of being studied. this can't end well. although much of the special effects are just jerky camera movement and loud, sudden noises. and i admit, in the movie theater, I would have jumped about a foot each time. Directed by John Pogue, who had also done The Skulls, and the Rollerball remake (that rated 3.1 on imdb, after 25000 votes!) Quiet ones did a little better, at 5.1 rating."
" Wasted good cast
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,6,Em algum momento de um passado não tão distante eu vi esse filme e esqueci completamente. Daí vi de novo e entendi porque que o esqueci. É péssimo... At some point in the not-so-distant past I saw this film and completely forgot. Then I saw it again and understood why I forgot it. It sucks ...#movieslover #hbo
" Surprisingly a thoughtful look at the supernatural
",2020-09-28 00:00:00,8,"Outside of the painfully poor choices made by characters, this film gives a new perspective on mental illness through supernatural ideas. Distracted by ego, the characters all are motivated to find something regardless of the potential obvious problems their ""experiment"" is causing. Still, intriguing with its frustrations, and holds up to multiple viewings. Not your standard film on the supernatural, but captivating as it provokes thought."
" First off the movie is based on the concept in the movie
",2020-09-24 00:00:00,6,The rest of it was fiction. Good movie however making people think it happened not cool also too many screams Gosh talk about screaming for jump scares and lastly the old man head scientist Dr was so irritatingly vulgar and Argh just horrible including the actor playing the role of the dirty old pervert proffeser
" Creepy in the wrong ways
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,2,Krissi well got in my nerves it seems like she was just there to have it off with everybody there. The professor is a total abusive cretin and even the possessed girl seemed like she just wanted sex. The whole film was just generic.
" Obviously watched a different movie to the critics!
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,7,"Really enjoyed it! Against the consensus, by the looks of things! I think people saw 'Hammer' and way over-estimated thingsThe stylisation is typical of similar horror/suspense movies, with their story being based on/inspired by real eventsThere is enough suspense, and there are enough moments of palpable fear, that make this deserving of your time"
" Horror movie defined by loud noises to scare you.
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,4,This isnt a bad movie. It just really irritates me when they purposely make the dialog barely audible so that you turn your tv up so you can follow the story. Then have all manner of loud noises to get cheap jump scares out of the audience. To me thats the biggest signal of a weak ass plot line or some other difficency the director or writers are trying to make up for. This movie is full of cheap jump scares with some real creepiness every so often.
" I Love Just About Any English...
",2020-06-04 00:00:00,4,"... but this tanks. I recalled that I had actually started watching this before, but barely paid attention and never saw the end.Now I know why. Boring, trite, done a million times before. The movie couldn't quite make up it's mind what it wanted to be - a true possession story or one about madness.All the tropes were here - sexy, but ""crazy"" girl that all the men want, internet doctor who crises boundaries, not as sexy as she thinks vamp, scratchy old films of psyche sessions where the characters say something mysterious on a dead voice and suddenly looks into the camera with a dead scare, bumps in the night, sudden loud nosies, stuff happening in too dark rooms, possessions...The pseudo science was downtight silly. I kept thinking maybe this was set a hundred years before.None of the acting was bad or even the special effects. The cinematography was fine.It was just... Boring."
" This Movie Was Pretty Good.....
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,8,+1 Star for Quiet Riot music!!!!!+1 Star For The Fun and Games up to the midpoint+1 For The End...I liked it.A Good story about a Paranormal Experiment gone just a tiny bit wrong. That's all..
" Almost impossible to watch
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,1,"The implementation is so boring and shiftless that The Quiet Ones turned out as a horrible, instead of a horror movie. What's left of a promising story idea is nothing more than a 98 minutes collection of endless jump-scares which makes it almost impossible to watch."
" I want my time back that I spent watching this...
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,2,"This movie was sort of one of the worst things I've ever seen...The end.... is so terrible I genuinely pulled a chunk of my own hair out in frustration at just having spent the time watching the movie, for it to end in a poorly acted cliche.I don't know what they teach in acting schools, but the ""mental patient"" trope that is repeatedly used to act SOOOOOO CRAZYYYYYYY literally makes me itchy to watch.The only reason why this didn't get one star, is that it did slightly surprise me. The slight twist of Jane's real identity was good, but the CLEAR familial relations between the Professor and his son that was supposed to be a ""surprise"" wasn't.There was needless special effects, like the weird throat worm. Why?
And the energy of the entire movie is so chaotic, it's like they are trying to explain to you what they are talking about in Russian. It really sort of makes no sense.They believe psychics exist, but ghosts do not? Ghosts are psychic energy? Then suddenly at the end of the movie, would you BELIEVE IT! It's BOTH! And what's this?! A CULT AS WELL!Wow the only thing that could make this worse would be if it was passed on like a disease and there was a terrible mental hospital scene of someone who was just soooooo insane now.... OH WAIT.Sad that these actors had to go through that. Sad that it made me hate Sam Claflin now. Sad that I wasted an hour and a half on watching it."
" ughhh VOLUME SPECTRUM
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,3,"I cut it off at 25 min...constantly having to adjust the volume. Loud as hell, characters whispering, loud as hell, characters whispering...SO ANNOYING"
" Standard
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,6,"Not a bad movie, just takes too long to get going, I love a Good possession film, but there's better out there."
" Did you say something? I missed it.
",2020-02-25 00:00:00,5,"Once in a while, I see a horror movie and near enough just forget that I saw it.This is a generic and not at all memorable movie with a basic and cliche premise plus a basic and cliched approach. I'm sick of horror movies that are all about sceptics and scepticism. It even uses the trope of using a university lecture to explore its ideas which I find lazy.So this isn't sinfully bad, but there wasn't anything in this that made me want to think about it."
" An effective possession horror
",2020-01-11 00:00:00,8,"Set in 1974, 'The Quiet Ones' tells the story of Jane, a young girl who may or may not be possessed. An Oxford professor is convinced that she simply has a psychological disorder and sets out to treat her. The cast is pretty good - Sam Claflin plays a videographer employed to document proceedings, while Olivia Cooke is the woman being treated. Jared Harris is the professor. The film has some scary moments, lots of jump scares and a reasonably original story. Worth a watch."
" Dreadfully boring
",2019-12-29 00:00:00,1,"The good
Nicely recreated 70's vibe. Clothes, cars etc.The bad
Pretty much everything else.
Character development virtually nil. Nothing happens for over an hour, then suddenly one of the characters goes off to a library and finds out the truth, tells the rest of the cast in a 3 minute scene and then there are some loud sound effects and a few cheesy alpha keyed flames and it's all over.
It was a nice idea that desperately needed someone who understands plotting to reel the audience in and drip feed the plot strands so the viewer goes on the journey of discovery with the cast.Verdict
Don't bother"
" Based on a true story??
",2019-11-08 00:00:00,7,"Ok so we all know that based on a true story really doesn't mean that it always is. But from what I know about the true story it starts pretty close. I guess that's why it doesn't push the story far enough. For me I wish there was more to it. It was almost scary. Almost creepy enough. It seemed to have so much potential yet it kinda fell flat for me. Just falling short. I really enjoyed it but I wish it had gone a little further. From what I understand it did go farther than the ""true story"" it's based on but for a scary/horror movie I had hoped for just a little more suspense. But I guess they only had so much to work with."
" Not so quiet ones
",2019-09-09 00:00:00,3,The movie would have been 10X better without all the screaming and sudden scares. They pull the old BS of having people talk softly so you crank up the sound then a sudden burst of sound happens so loud it hurts your ears. A third of the way through I started muting the scare scenes so I could hear the dialogue between the jump scares. The loud shrieking and bangs was just too much. I would have given it a 6 without the loud scares. For sound mixing they get a -10. They ruined a perfectly good movie with decent acting out of a desperation to make it scary without much happening.
" Hammer production without Cushing
",2019-06-19 00:00:00,6,Always loved some of the hammer horror classics when I was a kid. This might be closer to classic horror. A mysterious research subject is not all that she seems.
" A New Take On Possession
",2019-05-18 00:00:00,7,"Is the girl merely mentally ill? Has she channeled the spirit of a dead girl? Is she possessed by the ghost of a dead person? Has she in some way created an alter ego? Has an ancient Sumerian god possessed her? We don't find out until after we have had to endure a dozen or more jump scares, sexism, sexual manipulation (done tastefully), some extreme physical violence and death, and Slade (yes, the early 70s Glam band). I give this one seven stars for good acting and a new plot twist not seen before."
" Take your hands out of your trousers now, please.
",2019-03-06 00:00:00,6,"A-Z Horror Movie of the Day...""The Quiet Ones"" (PG-13 - 2014 - US/UK)Sub-Genre: Paranormal
My Score: 5.8Cast=6 Acting=7 Plot=4 Ending=8 Story=8
Scare=3 Jump=4 F/X=7 Creep=7 Twist=4A university professor and a team of students conduct an experiment on a young woman, uncovering terrifyingly dark, unexpected forces in the process.""Take your hands out of his trousers now, please."" This movie is more Supernatural Thriller than Paranormal Horror. The first clue is that it's PG-13...right away you know there is no nudity or gore. It is just set to creep you out or make you jump like ""A Haunting in CT"" or ""Insidious"". This was definitely more of a creepy movie, but it had a good story. It is an ok watch...it just doesn't separate itself from others like it."
" Utterly dreadful.
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,1,"I have no problem with slow moving films, but I do have a problem with boring ones, and believe me, this is truly boring. To keep you awake there are numerous bangs, all at a high volume, you rush to turn the sound down, then can't hear the dialogue. The story had promise, but it certainly wasn't realised in this mess. A disgrace to the Hammer name. One to go on Ebay."
" The Quiet Ones deserves better recognition/ratings
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,8,Quite remarkable the way it is! It's about a experiments on a girl who's capable of bizarre supernatural abilities in a group study that escalate as things go on. The soundtrack is great and so is the editing. I'm also surprised it wasn't rated R since it's got a lot of intense elements plus a few moments that could've shown nudity. I think that just about sum things up and I'd rather not spoil anything.
" Utter tripe
",2018-12-18 00:00:00,4,"Pretentious, predictable, self-indulgent tripe. Boring beyond belief and when you are done watching it, you will either laugh or say ""well, there's two hours of my life that I will never have back-or both. A silly film that could have been much better and, at least, interesting. The only reason to watch this film is learn that virtually all grad students and professors involved in paranormal research smoke. The film does have one saving grace: as a drinking game where everyone takes a shot when you see someone smoking. Lol"
" Engaging enough but still somewhat problematic
",2018-10-12 00:00:00,8,"Attempting to conduct a dangerous experiment, a wild professor and a group of students begins to document the effects of the study on their target, but as the experiment starts becoming more dangerous they begin to wonder about the true nature of their target there which puts them in jeopardy.This was a fine if wholly problematic effort. One of the finer points of the film is the rather fun setup this uses to get going with the introduction of the supernatural activity. The central reasoning for the experiment, to test whether instances of supernatural activity manifests itself through negative thought in individuals, serves as a straightforward launching pad for the way this one starts to unleash the fun encounters later on as the proceedings become far more intense once they're inside the house. The experiments conducted to test that, from the incident involving her being strapped to the machine while other tortures are administered to her body in that condition, the seance conducted while everyone around witnesses the strange actions that unfold which are quite enjoyable which help to set the stage for the final half where it starts to get far more dangerous with the psychokinetic energy whipping around the rooms causing all sorts of disturbances along the way. There's also plenty of fun to be had with the way most of these scenes are shot with the video camera recording the experiments, making them found-footage style sequences which are somewhat chilling and creepy. As well, the finale offers some fun times here with the full reveal of what's going on and everybody's plans for each other which is a lot of fun in what happens as the gruesome actions inflicted on everyone has a lot to like. These here hold it up over its main flaws. The film's biggest issue is the fact that everything in the film is basically a one-note series of scenes that don't really do much of anything new for the scene as just about everything consists of loud screaming or sudden crashing that she seems to have caused through her sudden appearance. None of this is particularly frightening or scary and it just gets old after awhile being that this constitutes the majority of the films' actions and scare attempts. As well, the lame-duck finale just seems to go on forever and never really explain anything that comes up as the connections to everything here are so underwhelming that it really could've done more to help that out. Alongside the limited gore-effects due to the rating, there isn't much else wrong here.Rated PG-13: Violence, Language and Brief Nudity."
" Scathing review missing
",2018-09-06 00:00:00,2,I wouldn't be able to join the quiet ones and stay quiet if it wasn't because my feelings cannot be put into words..
" The Quiet Ones, despite the loud piercing jump scares, remains too quiet with its thrills.
",2018-05-24 00:00:00,4,"Parapsychological thrillers will always interest me. Blending supernatural tension with the complexity of psychology can make for some intriguing themes, many of which may be deemed as thought-provoking. This horror film however, falls short in most areas. Loosely based on the Philip Experiment, a university professor and a group of students experiment on a girl to prove that poltergeists are manifestations of the human psych as opposed to supernatural entities. Sounds interesting right? Correct, and this should've been more intriguing than what was actually executed. My attention was immediately drawn to the experiment. The psychology behind it rather fascinates me, and I appreciate that the screenplay dabbles into the morality and ethics of this test. At the end of the day they are torturing a girl and coagulating all of her negative energy into creating a fictitious character, whether you view that as inhumane of scientifically necessary is left for debate. The script involves you, allowing you to cast your own opinion. Just a shame the characters were incredibly one-dimensional and the thrills were non-existent. The jump scares consisted of extremely loud piercing noises. That was it. I had to pat my sound bar at the end of the film and say ""it's alright, you can rest your speakers now...it's done"". Harris gives a commanding performance and both Cooke and Claflin support him well. But again, the script doesn't allow any character development to be had. The small use of visual effects were uninspired, but given the extremely low budget I'll let it slide. Then we get to the concluding act and unfortunately it crumbles under its own weight. I would've preferred a more intelligent ending as opposed to a clichéd supernatural twist. It's not that I didn't like it, I just don't necessarily agree with how it was conveyed. It's a shame really, director Pogue had some decent material to work with yet somehow translated what should've been a thrilling horror into an unmemorable bore."
" Come on feel the noise
",2018-05-11 00:00:00,4,"The Quiet Ones is a low budget but routine supernatural horror film but it lacks scares despite giving out noisy jolts on a regular basis.Three students from Oxford University help Professor Joseph Coupland (Jared Harris) in an experiment in abnormal psychology. A young disturbed woman Jane is seemingly possessed by another entity called Evey. Once the university funding is cut, they move to a house in London, where Jane is effectively tortured.Jane is deprived of sleep, played loud music so evil Evey can manifest itself. Coupland seems to be unconcerned of Jane's wellbeing or the ethics of his experiments. He believes that nothing is supernatural but explained by the power of the mind which can be cured rationally. However things go bump in the night, visions and symbols are seen and a flaming long tongue shoots out at one point but Coupland seems to put a rationale explanation for it all.Brian (Sam Claflin) is the cameraman who records everything but becomes uneasy about lecherous Coupland's approach and is concerned about Jane who he believes is possessed.The film has a nice retro look about it as it is based in 1974 but it is cliched and generic. It is empty when it should had been eerie."
" NOTHING LIKE HOLDING A SEANCE WITH A CRAZY PERSON
",2018-04-17 00:00:00,4,"Oxford Professor Joseph Coupland (Jared Harris) leads a pair of student researchers plus a camera man, known as the ""quiet ones"" to discover and cure the insanity of Jane Harper (Olivia Cooke) through experimental means. Dr. Coupland believes Jane has ""negative energy"" that manifests itself into telekinetics which can be controlled to cure the patient. Belief in the supernatural is not tolerated.During the process, Brian (Sam Claflin) the camera man develops mutual feelings for Jane who has an imaginary demon named Evie. The time frame for this film is 1974 and it makes use of Slade's ""Come On Feel the Noise."" Early in the movie, the funding for the experiment gets cut so Brian volunteers to use cheaper lower quality film, just what I wanted to hear. Part of the movie is amateur hand held genre while some of it is not.The film scare factor doesn't pick up until about an hour into it. It then has some bad minor clue twists which didn't help the film's cause.Might work as a cheap rental. Not overpowering.Parental Guide: 2 f-bombs. Implied sex. Brief nudity."
" Best $200,000 film - ever
",2018-04-15 00:00:00,9,"I'm mostly impressed at what they did for $200,000, It's a very good film with a range of emotions. A creepy love story with enough scares to keep you engaged. Different enough to be worth your viewing time. Also, the dialogue was spoken strong enough, so I didn't need to use subtitles. I've seen too many movies forget about that."
" Has Creepy Moments, but Needed More Noise in the Horror Department
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,5,"The Quiet Ones has a nice sense of period (the 1970s) and some committed performances, but as it progresses it sadly gets caught in what becomes a repetitive loop. So, from a good introduction to the seemingly possessed Jane, the film then just replays the same 'possessed' scene over and over again in terms of the group conducting experiments which produce some 'spooky' effect. This is effective at first, but it then becomes really rather tiresome, and I was truly past caring by the time the Carrie-style finale (although not in the same league, naturally) finally (and I mean finally) kicks in. So, while it is good to see the Hammer Films label in the 21st century, this is no Dracula."
" Nicely atmospheric but not particularly scary
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,6,"Set in 1974 this film follows an experiment undertaken by Joseph Coupland, an Oxford professor; his assistants Krissi Dalton and Harry Abrams; and Brian McNeil, a recently recruited cameraman who is to document proceedings. It is explained that the subject of the experiment is Jane Harper; a very troubled young woman. She is suicidal, has no memory of her childhood and has been in a succession of foster homes; each of which she left after unexplained 'accidents. Coupland thinks he can cure her by drawing out the negative energy and effectively create a poltergeist something he believes is a manifestation of negativity rather than anything supernatural. Soon the university removes their backing for the experiment and he, along with Jane and the others relocate to a large house. Here Jane starts talking about 'Evey'; a negative energy which Coupland tries to encourage Jane to transfer into a doll. It isn't long before strange things start to happen; things Coupland is convinced aren't supernatural but it is clear that whatever the cause they are all in danger. Things are further complicated by the fact that Brian is clearly developing feelings for Jane.This 2014 film from Hammer nicely captures the '70s feeling and has a good central premise; the problem is that for a film billed as a horror it just isn't that scary; there are a few decent jump scares and it is a bit creepy but I expected more The DVD box states that it is 'From the makers of ""The Woman in Black""' but at no point did it have the skin-crawling terror of that film despite its higher BBFC rating. The acting was impressive; most notably from Olivia Cooke who was brilliant as Jane, Jared Harris who was suitably ambiguous as Professor Coupland and Sam Claflin as Brian, the most ordinary of the characters. The special effects were decent enough and the camera-work added to the atmosphere even if is felt a bit sub-'Blair Witch' during some scenes. Overall I'd say it is worth watching if it is on TV or the DVD is in the bargain bin but it is a bit disappointing if you are expecting some real scares."
