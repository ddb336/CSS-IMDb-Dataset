" An emotional roller coaster
",2021-03-24 00:00:00,8,"Inside out tells the story of The Voice little voices inside your head we are introduced to joy,sadness,anger,fear and disgust. The Emotions that make up Riley Anderson's personality. Joy discusses how everything going well in headquarters and work alongside the others. all seems fine until Riley's parents decides to move to San Francisco after Riley's father gets a new job.with a new home and new school it's all the turmoil for Riley. to overcome this joy tries to make the best of it until sadness alters a core memory and both are thrown from headquarters they must find a way back. Riley can get her personality and life back on track. Riley and even her parents makes the perfect cast in this film to connect to as the audience. At some point a lot of People go through this ordeal with having to move away from home and having to start a new and demanding that is a challenge of mentally and emotionally.When describing the emotions joy is overall a de facto leader she's overly vibrant and full of energy. she comes off rather a control freak who thinks that her way is best that Riley is happy 24/7 and doesn't really care for the others interfere. Sadness is sadness she's depressed she's unmotivated and a downer but she has in her own way of understanding and slowly over the course Joy sees her purpose and how she is important. Anger disgust and fear also play a part in showing how drastically they can alter Riley's choices and affect her life. They all act in such a way that you can see a bit of yourself in each one of them in someway. There's a scene where they put an idea lightbulb in Riley's thought and she follows through on it just like that. It plays off of that aspect that when you have an idea you don't fully think on it and most likely we will just act on it at first hand. The theme of this movie Emotions and feelings are many highlights where you feel for the characters and feel the same as they do. you feel happy and energetic you feel moments of sadness and you care for the situation. Particularly with Riley's imaginary friend being bong moments in this movie feel rather organic and in my ways people can actually relate. Visually the film is stunning arguably one of Pixar's most colorful movies both figuratively and literally. The music set to a soothing piano tune appropriates it's calm and somber tone. One of the few things that move have you come away question is probably what the other islands look like you only get to see imagination.One of the few things that move have you come away question is probably what the other islands look like you only get to see imagination. Given how this movie ends it wouldn't be that inappropriate it was done right to make a sequel of this with Riley older. Inside out is an emotional roller coaster of film, colorful film, a meaningful film that is fun but also deep and compelling. I will most likely go down as one of modern animations best masterpieces."
" Love it!
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,10,"Such a cute movie. Beautifully animated,adventurous story,and emotional too. Riley is very relatable because growing up and everything is changing is very difficult. Amazing movie well done pixar,one of your best!"
" The Dark Souls of cinema
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,10,This movie is good.I especially liked the bit when the people were talking or something. You know the part. It was pretty good.
" Adults will understand the references
",2021-03-17 00:00:00,10,"As I said, Adults will understand the references.
A really good movie, although its animated and appears to be a childs movie its filled with a lot of adult content/food for thought, that some may be able to relate to.
If you are a thinker, always having things running through your mind, if you feel isolated and always have conflicting thoughts and ideas, then maybe you will relate to the main character in this movie, more than some reviewers have."
" too graphic
",2021-03-17 00:00:00,2,Kids trying to cave in each others head just to see sadness 2.6/10
" This movie is a 10!!!
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,10,This movie is totally a 10 (or 9 or 8) and if you say otherwise is because you totally missed the point. I can't express how much this movie helped me through depression (among other things). Absolutely loved it!
" A must watch for all!
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,9,This film has great messages for people of all ages(mostly children) and I think that families should watch this movie as this is a fantastic movie and it's also very creative. Pixar as usual comes up with many creative stories to tell and this was definitely one of them and thisovie is definitely one of my most favourite Pixar film.I highly recommend to everyone.
" Sadness
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,10,One of Pixar's best films.Sadness is my favorite character.
" Arguably the best Pixar film.
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,10,"This movie inverts the usual children's film trope in which the protagonist finds their ""true self"" and wins, Inside Out demonstrates that rather than one overriding sense of bravery or happiness we are made up of differing emotions who can all be active at the flick of a button, and we needn't ignore negative feelings but learn to live with them and grow as people.
Truly one of the most thought provoking and interesting Disney Pixar films I've seen."
" Masterpiece
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,10,Amazing movie from start to finish. Fun for all ages and inspirational.
" Fun and enjoyable.
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,9,"A bit surprised reading some of the polarisation in comments and opinions here. The movie is fun, the concept of giving that voice inside your head an identity is cool, and admittedly it is something most children of a certain age may not get, but it's a fun family pic regardless. Remember that this is a Pixar movie so don't expect Gone With The Wind and just enjoy!"
" Outstandingly well made
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,9,"I'm not going to lie, I'm a Pixar fan so natural bias has probably crept in here but regardless of this I still maintain this is an outstandingly well made film and a beautiful attempt to visually represent how our mind works. Inside Out is not slick and funny like Monsters inc. or as ground breaking as Toy Story but it's very possibly my favourite Pixar film, it's just so smart and beautifully executed. The characters in particular have clever little floors in their personalities to make them seem altogether more real and the messages the film puts across around our emotions are truly relatable.
Anyone who doesn't understand this film I suspect has questionable emotional intelligence as it truly is a masterpiece for all ages"
" Life is about more than constant sunshine and happiness
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,10,The parents on here saying they would never expose their kids to this... why? Because they shouldn't learn that life changes as you get older? That sometimes sadness can be a good emotion.Wrapping your children in cotton wool will not shield them from life. Children aren't going to run away because they watched this. It's about learning how to navigate hard feelings.
" Flight of the homunculi
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,6,"Philosopher Blaise Pascal raised the idea that inside every human mind was a humunculus, a mini-being controlling us; the question of what lay within the mind of the humunculus went unanswered. The idea has turned up intermittantly in popular culture ever since (including, cinematically, in the hands of Woody Allen, who played a sperm in one of his early films). In 'Inside Out', a girl is controlled by an entire team of mini-mes; but for me, this isn't one of the great Pixar movies. The plot is basically 'Toy Story' redux, and, while there are some good gags, the film lacks the internal coherence of the best Pixar work, and mostly paints with a broad brush. You won't find the subtle beauty of 'WALL-E' or 'Up' here; although I did like the cat, walking on the keyboard."
" Amazing, everyone should watch
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,9,"Back in 2015, when Inside Out first hit the theatre, I was forced to join my brother on the trip to go see it. And yet, even then, as a 12 year-old with a mere perception no better than a child, I was still entranced by the cutting-edge animations (I mean it's Pixar we're talking) and the rather pacing yet interesting plot-line. Those were, however, As much as an adolescent can get, the definite messages and meanings of menial scenes and details - which I think were profoundly and minutely appended for the sake of expanding the process of solely watching the movie to learning and attaining something from it - were obscure and obsolete to me at that point in time.The reason why this is necessary to be acknowledged is that, 6 years later, as a teenager who is on the brink of understanding who he is as a person and repositioning himself into the world of adulthood, I do think this is one movie that all children and adolescents should watch and understand, even if it is hard to, to grow, and to be mindful of the cruciality of nourishing and controlling the states of their own, to be uninfluenced by others, their lives, their emotions are their, and should be determined by themselves.Inside Out by Disney poses incredible lessons and meanings through phenomenal ability to push the audiences further and further in their own thoughts to explore and seek the ultimate message, that line that culminates the whole experience and, in the end, completes it. What did I found?Nothing, there was nothing there.Through my whole magnificent expedition in the land of emotions and memories, I was totally embarked completely in exhilarating moments after moments of overlapping excitement, as if there was nothing there, and until the very near-end, I was lost and left with nothing. The captivity and fascination took me all the way, I was constantly thinking, browsing through my thoughts and memories whilst trying to seize as much details from the scenes as possible, it was so interesting that I was lost completely in the movie, and until the very finish line, I looked back and was immediately packed with countless flows of perceptions and views that I had to write it down.Inside Out, in the utmost apparent manner, tells a story of emotions, in particular Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust and Fear. The Five collectively control the fundamental mental states of Riley, a young little girl whose life preceding was filled with happiness with mom and dad, friends, Hockey, and many more. But then because of certain issues, their family had to move away, that's where problems came in, big sudden changes never bring about good news. Small room, busy parents, new classes, new people, led to quarrels between the emotions, and then Joy and Sadness got lost, and while they were on their journey trying to get back, Riley had to live her life with only disgust, anger and fear, imagine how that would be, everything in her life fell apart. As for Joy and Sadness, through different twists and turns, coming against all sorts of unwanted dilemmas and plights, Joy started to understand the true purpose and importance of sadness. Upon going back, they developed their realization of the indispensability of one another and ended with a quintet working together creating balance and great symmetry within Riley's emotional states.I was lost in the story telling and filled with emotions in every bit of the way, and in that scene where Riley came back to her parents, and Sadness took control, I couldn't help but let the tears come out of my eyes. Such a heartfelt, strong, exciting, moving movie and I have to give props to the writers and the producers from Disney on Inside Out and many more of course.So, this is what I think:From far and wide, I do reckon the writers have captured the essence of communicating an effective plot that Inside Out can be seen and appreciated by almost every person from every year of age. By telling the story with characters that are so abstract, by bringing them to life and allow them to narrate, the writers force us to think outside of what's happening in the movie alone, because emotions are things all of us possess the courses of actions we are seeing can be the exact same of what happen inside our head as well. We as viewers are tempted to visualize and correspond using our own experience and awareness. And through that, we start to understand more about Riley, she was a happy girl, but one simply can't be happy ceaselessly, not because she can't; but sometimes, sadness brings people together, it helps people listen, it helps people sympathize and empathize, it helps people slow down, it helps people cry, be patted in the shoulders: ""you've done well, next time will be great"", and eventually come back up, better, learned, and loved, isn't that what does best in connecting humans? What I took away most from the movie is that: Emotions are there, they won't go anywhere, it is our job to keep it how we want it, uninfluenced by anything, strong, stable, and use them wisely to live how we want, because our emotions affect intensely our behaviors, and however we behave will decide our relationships, our careers, and ultimately, our lives.Ultimately, such movies like Inside Out are really important to be acknowledged and appreciated nowadays because they present lessons and messages that can help people realize numerous good things in their lives and live better, for themselves, and for everyone else around them.Recommended"
" Another good movie by Disney in its recent years
",2021-02-19 00:00:00,8,"I had heard about this movie lots of times since it came out and only a few months ago (during the total lockdown) I had the occasion of seeing it. And it was good just like the other great Disney movies. As there are more than 1,080 reviews to date I'll be brief.This film is about a young girl named Riley that at the beginning moves in a big town because she has to go to school. Inside her, her emotions (Joy, Sadness, Anger and Disgust) play with her memories and cause the wrong reactions in her. This causes Joy to make a long trip for adjusting all memories and after a while Riley is adapted to her new home, but not after crying a lot.The animation is very good as usual with Disney, the characters were funny and endearing and the voice acting was decent. The only problem (and it has been pointed out by various reviewers) is that the plot is complex for children. I was 21 when I saw it so I agree a lot with it. This is an animated movie that has a plot more comprehensible to adults and teens than small kids."
" One of the most real movies in a long time
",2021-02-11 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie. Anyone in touch with themselves will feel how real and accurate Inside Out is, and that's why it's refreshing. It's not something that's been recreated over and over and over again. It's not a dumb, mindless movie. The storyline, characters, and setting was extremely relatable for me (and I would assume a lot of kids/people) and that's what pulls you in. There's hilarious jokes throughout, and sad moments which balance the movie. I know a lot of bad reviews were because they thought it was ""too scary"" or ""too complex"" for kids, but I don't think it's any different than movies I grew up with in the 90s. Snow White and The Brave Little Toaster has scary animations, and there's plenty of super sad moments in older movies (and recent Pixar movies), like The Lion King. The difference with Inside Out is that it depicts those emotions in a relatable way, through an 11-year old dealing with situations a lot of kids have dealt with. It shows how complex they can be, and creates a simplified way of looking at yourself, how it all works in your brain, so it doesn't feel as overwhelming or scary. I think the happy ending was necessary, because you don't want to show kids that feelings of sadness or fear lead something bad and that's it. You want to show them that it's normal, and it gets better. I personally think this should be a requirement for everyone to watch, you'll laugh and cry and feel like a human being again."
" Compelling story
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,9,"More compelling that usual animated movies.9/10What makes the film compelling will be the characters, both external and internal. It is consistently fun to watch the emotions, for even though they are one-dimensional, their personalities clash and react in dynamic ways. Thanks to their relationships, Riley and her family are brought to life in a perfectly lovable way as well. Their struggles are struggles that we can all relate to though; the film underscores the turmoil around life changes and maturity that we all face at some point, and through those fundamental conflicts, the film reaches an emotional resonance as the characters straddle the threshold of maintaining psychological stability."
" TO ALL THE HATERS...
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,8,"...You're in the MINORITY.As of January 2021, it has an 8.1 overall rating, and the overwhelming majority gave this movie positive reviews.371 people rated it 10 stars, 230 rated it 9, 177 rated it 8 stars, 78 gave it 7 stars, 44 people gave it 6, 34 people gave it 5 stars, 21 rated it 4 stars, 23 gave it a 3, 16 people gave it 2 stars...and 63 haters gave it a 1 star rating.Yes, it's probably not for kids under 7 or so, and yes, it's a little complex and perhaps complicated at times. And yes, sad.BUT SO IS LIFE. And that's the point of the movie. If we don't embrace and accept our sadness without shame or embarrassment, then we can't come together and help each other work things out.The only reason I'm giving it 8 instead of 10 stars, is because it was a little long. They probably could've cut 15 minutes out and we never would've missed a thing."
" Inside Out
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,8,"Inside Out, originated by Pete Docter & Ronnie del Carmen, put out the most unique & fresh story premise since Toy Story in 1995! With Docter directing, del Carmen screenwriting, & Andrew Stanton & John Lasseter producing, they brought back the Pixar hype, coming off the mediocre titles in Brave, Monsters University & The Good Dinosaur.The concept is very creative & original, with a very clever narrative. The story was very well paced, touching up on real world problems, hitting many emotional notes. For a children's film, it is very mature, while still having great family fun. For a fictional tale, this film really made you think after the movie; I'd be lying if I said I never thought about this in my head.The characters were just a blast of fun, with everyone having their own definitive personalities, of course. Our master child if you will, had great real life problems. Her character really reflects on what it's like at that age, and what your emotions feel at most times. If Pete Docter & Ronnie del Carmen wanted to get real crazy, they could've added emotions like, love, loyalty, caring, etc, but they would've had to re-write the whole narrative for that to work. I got myself so invested into Sadness, that I built this real-life hate for her.The screenplay by Ronnie del Carmen, Josh Cooley & Meg LeFauve had plenty of solid laughs, incorporating deep dialogues, speaking about mature, real world issues.It truly goes without say, the cinematography & animations are just as close to flawless as it gets. Everything had amazing detail, being either vibrant or dull while showing great texture. The production designer in Ralph Eggleston created this outside the box world, incorporating terrific set pieces.Overall, I didn't really find to much wrong with this film, other than it being a little slower at times, and it kind of copied that Toy Story feel a little; nevertheless very solid Pixar film, to show that they're back in action, while winning an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film."
" My kids love it, we love it
",2021-01-21 00:00:00,9,"I don't know why the hate, it's a great film. The kids don't understand it but love it anyway."
" a masterpiece with a unique concept
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,10,The concept was unique and the story was great.. the movie gives a lesson to kids about life . the best thing is you can watch it even if you are a adult..
" Perfect animation
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,10,"The animation was perfect, really great We have never had an animation like this before, it was a new and successful work. All the characters were great except the sadness, she made me nervous."
" The best psychological Animation
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,9,It is the best refrence of how we should pay attention to childerns' soul
" Fantastic
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,9,"A movie that shows the genius of Pixar's storytelling in a way that few of their other movies do. I love all of their movies, but the message and themes in Inside Out are on another level, making it incredibly relatable for parents, and enjoyable for kids. Our 3 year old daughter really enjoys it, and she obviously doesn't grasp all of the metaphors and relationships it so amazingly depicts. The voice acting is spot on, the way they've created the world within someone's mind is absolutely incredible, and the emotions this movie will cause you to feel run the gamut. My wife and I cried and felt incredibly happy at the same time. See this movie."
" One of the best Ever 10/10
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,10,Another spiritual journey by Pixar. Woww. I see some reviews simply barking without a clue
" Doctor's only real misfire. It is so fundamentally confused
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,5,"This film is very frustrating because it is so close to being a wonderful experience that ranks among the very best Pixar. But the concept is just not suited to a longer narrative film-especially one that is intended to be a bittersweet comedy. The emotion-people are driving around us people-people is a funny, striking concept. The film flashes brilliance repeatedly by using this concept logically. Lewis Black as Anger is some of the best casting of all time. But alas the film doesn't work. I believe the following three conceptual problems is what does the film in.First Riley is not a real character in the film because Riley is not the seat of consciousness-Joy is. (This is true for all human ""characters"" and their dominate emotions.) This means that the story of Riley adjusting to moving to San Francisco rings entirely hollow because Riley is a mere automaton. She feels *nothing* only her emotion-people do. (The film's conception of how emotions work is *really* hard to work out the details.)Second, Joy and the other emotion-people are basically stuck in whatever emotion they are or cause. I.e. Joy is joyful, Fear is fearful, etc. This ends up causing two problems: the characters can be annoying because conceptually they are stuck in a single mode. Joy-being the main character-suffers the most from this. She is too chirper and it is grating. People might differ on this and find say Sadness too morose. Second, the emotion-people should not be able to feel emotions besides they one they are. Joy is Joyful and she should be unable to feel anything else at all.This brings me to the third conceptual problem. The film cheats on the last point and allows the emotion-people to have emotions besides the one they are. Joy for example *feels* sadness. This is because drama requires characters to change through time-this is why I think the concept is better suited to a short. However, this utterly undermines the explanation of where emotions come from that is the basis of the film. Either Joy herself has five emotions in *her* head to control *her* emotions or the emotion-people feel emotions as brute fact. In either case it does not work as an explanation; you either get an infinite regressions (it's emotions in heads all the down!) or there is no explanation for the emotion-people emotions beyond brute fact but in that case why no simply say humans feel as brute fact?The last point might seem like I am taking the film too literally. Perhaps I am but even as metaphor I find the conceptual problems to much to stomach. I simply cannot suspend my disbelief and go with the film. It is more perplexing and ill-considered the more you look at it."
" This thing is so emotionally potent
",2021-01-08 00:00:00,10,"Can't wrap my head around the fact this movie was actually made, can only congratulate Pixar. It's so original and unique, and artistic, and brave, and simply memorable. As a man who is going to be 24 in a few weeks, I cannot believe how much fun I enjoyed it. The scene in the ""abstract thought shortcut"" is really showing the wild possibilities when it comes to animation."
" Disney can do way better
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,3,"I fell like most of the people loved this movie but I can stand it!
In my opinion it was so boring and I found no guidelines or fun.
I've watch it for 2 times now and it gets worst, I just don't get it !"
" What happens on the inside?
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,9,"Inside Out is a great movie by Disney Pixar that deals with the systems that take place in people's heads. It is a really nice film, which explains very nicely the processes that happen up in the brain. It was overlooked by the Academy while the public pushed for it to have an Academy Award.
It is a film with several depths, and at the points where where I initially thought there were some mistakes, is put to shame in the last third of the film. The few things that make the film not get top grade are respectively the small mistake that happens when Riley leaves home, in relation to when the parents come home, and then I do not think that the feelings of disgust, anger and especially fear got their justification in the film. But a really sweet and educational film to start the year on."
" Pretty good, but not amazing like some people make it out to be
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,6,"Inside Out is a rather creative film that I also found a bit boring and cringe inducing, it tried too hard to generate emotion that it just came off weird.The acting's not bad and I found the characters interesting at least, but the way people are getting upset over the character ""Bing Bong"" dying is laughable. It's a very creative film and is good but it's not amazing and certainly not Oscar worthy, Bing Bong was an annoying character and Riley herself doesn't have much individuality and personality. If anything by limiting the characters like Rage and Joy to just one characteristic and emotion it limits how interesting they are as a person.6/10: Good in places, dull in others and obnoxious in some. It's still a good film and I'm glad others enjoyed it more than me but I struggled to get into it"
" I dont unterstand the hipe
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,4,"When i watched this film the first time i was 7 , so practically a kid. And i liked how it was drawn and stuff and the funny characters, but now ,and also then i thaugt that it was veeery cliché. Example: There is a Scene where you can see what's going on in the heads of Rileys Mom and Dad. Rileys Dad tust thinks of Sports and is not listening to his wife and her mom is annoyed of him and thinks of her dream man. Really? This is so hostile to men and woman.
So i dont unterstand al these people talking stuff like: Yes this is such a psychologically valuable film. No its not!And the Story is like every other Barbie movie.
A girl is sad cause she's movig away with her parents, she's having a mental breakdown and wants to flee, but then at the end she has friends and everything is alright.So if u want to watch this Movie just to see something from Pixar then do it!
But if u want to see something psychologically valuable then watch Ladybird ore something but not this!"
" Really Good
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,9,To all the 1 and 2 review scores... you do realize it's a film.. A pretend film. A not real film. And a cartoon type film which is even more not like real... some of the 1 and 2 score ratings and laughable... people need to take a chill pill.. I see joy isn't working in you're brains...A very very good film.. A joy to watch..
" Terrible Movie
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,4,"Just watched Soul by Pixar and Disney and it made me remembered how bad Inside Out was compared to Soul. If you had to pick between both, go for Soul 10/10.Now back to this, I'm misled by this movie thinking it was ABOUT RILEY and how her emotions plays out. The main character/lead should be RILEY, not JOY; not one single emotion. Very confused..."
" A clinicians perspective
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,10,"I'm not suprised this has been recieved poorly by many. This movie pushes back on how Americans view emotions culturally. However, we see the impact of our stifled view on emotions by the level of depression and anxiety in our society.Emotions need to be felt. They are an indication that something is happening. Not that they are the end all be all, but if we can tolerate distress we can navigate them effectively. Riley spends much of the movie not being able to name what is happening. Trying to just push through and be positive while ignoring what your body is telling you is damaging.We see her work through this and be able to share her sadness with her parents who love her where shes at. And it helps deal with the distress. This is called secure attachment. Kids and adults need it. Having someone you know cares doesnt make the crappy situation go away, but it makes it tolerable.The fact people cant tolerate the discomfort into this movie is telling. There is so much to be learned here.Want to learn more about these things? Check out the work of Dr. Dan Siegal and Dr. Sue Johnson."
" One of Pixar's best.
",2020-12-28 00:00:00,7,Your kids will love it. You will need tissues as well. But the lack of music and humor makes you feel somewhat boring at first forty minutes or so. Otherwise it's a great movie to watch with your family.
" Pixar nailed it !!!
",2020-12-28 00:00:00,7,The last thirty minutes can definitely bring you tears. And a perfect film to watch with your family...
" Straight to the core memories
",2020-12-28 00:00:00,9,"I'm not sure if I'm the only one, but anyone who suffers with mental illness may have 'blackened or phased out' emotions.Watching this film and actually sitting through it allows you to realise that those emotions are still there and gets you to focus on them more.In my opinion a fun film with a realistic outlook of the mind. Not only this, but the kids do not budge throughout the whole film."
" An incredible movie with beautiful animation and ideas
",2020-12-28 00:00:00,10,"This movie is awesome. It's funny, it's imaginative, the animation are incredible and it has a great story to tell. My favorite Pixar movie."
" You turn me Inside Out
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,10,"With this you can see how long Pixar had come since Toy Story in 1995 with CGI, and how animation and expressions had grown in animation since like Robin Hood 1973. Here we follow Riley on her emotional journey and the things inside her brain. Whenever you want action, fun, feels or few scares here it is so stream this now if you have 80 minutes."
" Best animated movie of all time.
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,10,Fantastic story line. Emotional film. Awesome characters development. This movie is just perfect.
" Wonderful
",2020-12-22 00:00:00,8,"It's surprising how many people managed to completely miss the point of this movie. Sure, it may not be a tearjerker (for me, anyway) but it's something that directly applies to every single person viewing. It may very well be the most universally targeted Pixar film because, similarly to what Toy Story 3 set out to accomplish, the fundamental message of the film has to do with the way we view childhood as we age. It's told in a way that is 100% kid-friendly but also has a message that will appeal to adults.
Of course, it lives up to the gold-standard expectation from Pixar: beautiful animation, well-crafted story, a talented crew of voices to really make it all come to life. It's a nice little heartwarming story that is endlessly imaginative and fun, and a heartfelt project from the director. Definitely a must-see film."

",2020-12-20 00:00:00,10,"I tears to crying in all the runtime, very original, exploring something that we have but we didn't thought of it this way before this PIXAR masterpiece. The originality in all PIXAR films are amazing, the creativity, the thought, the dreams, the tears and the joy that brings to my and every heart. Joyful, love it. PIXAR do not stop, you are my endless dream."
" Powerful and uplifting
",2020-12-15 00:00:00,8,"After a second viewing I have settled on the problem I originally had and can now honestly say this film really just has nitpick issues, it's truly a great one and definitely the best we've been given in 2015 so far. After my first viewing I was all enthusiastic about everything above, but I also was left a little confused by the mythology the film uses and wasn't quite sure it always fit. Upon a second viewing I guarantee that there is no such problem. The mythology is perfect and works with a solid and thought out logic that takes into account the chaos of life. What doesn't quite work is the fact that the film does have a few really minor shortcuts or conveniences that may stick out and I honestly wanted a little bit more of the control center room scenes and see some more of how it worked there, but then again I am really nitpicking.Incredible for me to say it, but I really want a sequel to this film, it's incredible. I want to see another two hours of the five emotions battling in out in the life of Riley and her further struggles, especially want to see the teenage years. This idea is truly amazing and special and it is so inspiring to me, I just really want a sequel to this film and that's the first time I've ever said that in my life."
" Boring and no dept
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,5,"Good for you, for first reading the review. Coz I went in blank.First of all it was really weird not to see the emotion of surprise, I kept thinking that emotion would be hidden (or maybe there were already thinking about a sequel).The movie has some funny moments, but it just doesn't live up to Pixar standards they we are used to (don't expect Monster Inc).The story is very predictible and becomes are drag quite quick. Even the ""sad' moment feels staged an you see it coming. Would recommend this movie to anyone. There are so many better titles."
" Loved this
",2020-12-11 00:00:00,10,"Maybe all the people who rated below 7 missed the point out of this movie. Do a little research, this is a a movie based on psychological research and all of the emotions that we face in our everyday lives.
We force happiness because this is what is accepted by the society. So you should teach your kids to be open with their emotions and so on..."
" How Lazy Is This Film!

" Crying is often the best way to get rid of pain
",2020-12-03 00:00:00,10,"Inside out symbolizes the eternal struggle between sadness and joy, after we came to live in a world that always pretends to be happy and contented (Be happier, be the best ..)
This film comes to place the overlap between the different feelings that govern a person, especially joy and sadness, the two components that consist of Our life. Like other emotions, sadness is also a way to solve problems and feel psychological comfort, and often crying is the best way to get rid of pain.The idea of the film is very innovative and very profound, dealing with the concept of happiness, sadness, family, memories and dreams.
We had a wonderful journey in Riley's mind in search of a solution to live a better life, without abandoning the family, friends, or memories that build our personalities.
The sound performances was very wonderful especially Phyllis in the role of sadness and Richard as Bing Bong, the animation was great, choosing colors for every feeling was a great idea
The dream world was presented in a unique way that I had never seen before, the world of memories was also magical
Inside Out is truly one of the best Pixar movies ever"
" AMAZING! Pixar's best, I'd say - Fun, heartwarming, imaginative comedy: Inside Out
",2020-12-02 00:00:00,10,"This film is absolutely beautiful. The concept itself - so unique!Riley, an 11-year-old girl from Minnesota has to do a cross-country move to San Francisco. But she hates it there, and her emotions Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust and Fear don't know what to do.Inside Out deals with complex themes like change and growing up, often misunderstood. It's a great watch for adults and children alike.The animation is stunning, voice acting is great, and there's something funny in every line! This is a masterpiece for everyone. Watch it today if you haven't!"
" Best Pixar movie of the decade!(Soul is not available yet)
",2020-11-30 00:00:00,10,As a 7-year-old I used to hate this movie because my mom put it all the time! But now I can watch it over and over and over again. It shows us that everyone is important to keep balance and that after sadness comes joy and you can't live without all of the emotions. I cried a lot in this movie and Pete Doctor one of the biggest geniuses in Pixar's history created this thing! In conclusion if you don't like this movie what is your problem??????????
" Inside Out
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,9,"The film takes us on a journey inside the mind, through which we discover images of the success and failure of human experiences as well. These voices are embodied in front of us as part of a comedic and dramatic adventure. The film deals with the inner emotional turmoil experienced by the eleven-year-old child Riley; Where her life is turned upside down because her family is forced to move to another city, and then move away from her friends and all the things she loves from places, things, activities and memories. These feelings are embodied in the interaction between five main characters who live inside Riley's mind and lead her daily life: ""joy"", ""sadness"", ""anger"", ""fear"" and ""disgust."" The movie is one of the best Pixar films"
" The best Pixar movie since WALL-E and Toy Story!
",2020-11-27 00:00:00,10,"Okay, so I'm a huge fan of Pixar, especially when I was a kid. It's my favorite animation studio. It made tons a great family animated movies like the Toy Story series, WALL-E, Inside Out, The Incredibles, Up, Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc., Coco, and Ratatouille. It also made some movies that are enjoyable but not great like the Cars series, Monsters University, Brave, and The Good Dinosaur. Pixar is also worthy for any age honestly. Anyways, Inside Out is fantastic! The animation is really stunning and colorful to look at. The concept and story is really imaginative and makes you imagine what your mind looks like inside and what your emotions would do to you. The music by Michael Giacchino is very nice to listen and great. The voice acting is really good, especially from Amy Koehler, Phyllis Smith, Lewis Black, and Richard Kind. The themes about life is very powerful. The humor is very funny, especially with the scenes involving Anger. The screenplay is very well written and smart as well. For me, Inside Out equals Toy Story and WALL-E as the best Pixar movie and the best animated movie of all time! I watched it a bunch of times and never grew tired of it, especially on vacations. It's a lot of fun and worth watching for everyone!"
" Worst Movie Ever Made!
",2020-11-24 00:00:00,1,Simply the worst movie ever created and ever will be.
" A must-watch
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,9,"I've watched this movie a couple times now and I have loved it each time. I think some people are really missing the point of the movie: it's okay to be sad sometimes and you cannot force happiness. Joy is a very annoying character at times but she is meant to be (at times). I think everyone (including younger kids and adults) can learn that it actually is okay not to be okay, and this funny and clever movie is a great way to learn it."
" Convoluted mess without entertainment value.
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,1,"Love them or hate them, Disney movies have always had one thing in common: they tried to transport you into a magical world populated with interesting, colorful characters.""Inside Out' foregoes that tradition and seems to be trying to explain basic principles of psychology to young audiences. The result is a mess: not only is it not 'fun', it's also constantly shoehorning painful exposition mechanism by having characters explain what's on screen.I just don't see kids below 10 enjoying this in the least. And as an adult, there are better ways to learn about psychology than watching an animated film.Utterly bizarre."
" What happens with Bing Bong?
",2020-11-10 00:00:00,5,"Joy returns back to the central and forgot Bing Bong. She said she would remember Bing Bong if he show her how to go back to the central station. Joy is a bad feeling, bad friend and manipulates everybody, even Sadness"
" Inside emotions
",2020-11-09 00:00:00,8,"Inside out will always be a treasure in my heart. The characters trick you to believe that you have them in your head. We all wish we could have a Joy in our heads just like Riley does. Everybody wants to be happy all the time but we all a Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Discussed, along with Joy. Even though Riley isn't happy all the time it shows the audience that its normal not to be happy all the time. As Rliey progresses in the movie, the emotions that she has get more and more controlled. Just like the audience . Inside Out was also created by Disney's Pixar productions. Some other movies also created by Pixar include Cars, Up, and Toy Story. So, if you love those you will certainly love Inside Out. Riley's ""core memories"" surrounds the entire movie that you will be at the edge of your seat. Without her core memories she isnt Riley. The emotions in her head do anything and everything to make Riley, Riley again! This outstanding movie could never get old."
" Are You Happy Now?
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,10,"Out of all of the Pixar films I've seen, 'Inside Out' is still my favourite. It's an inventive exercise in psychology, philosophy, mental health and slice of life comedy drama while being original and exciting.
Eleven year old Riley Anderson had a happy childhood in Minnesota, until her parents sell their house and move to San Francisco. Her five emotions all struggle to cope. Joy, the leader of the emotions, who looks like Tinkerbell with Zach Callinson's hair, tries to keep Riley's mind balanced, but she represses Sadness in an attempt to stop Riley's day being ruined. What Joy doesn't know is that she's unintentionally hurting Riley in her efforts to give her happy memories.
This all builds up to the first day of school, where Riley breaks down in tears over her memories of Minnesota. As it happened, Sadness touched one of Riley's core memories and turned it blue. A fight breaks out and Joy and Sadness are trapped in Riley's subconscious. Now that Riley has surpressed her sadness, it came at the cost of her joy, too, and all that's left is pain, pain, pain.
The rest of the film consists of Joy and Sadness trying to get back to their headquarters, with Riley's old imaginary friend Bing Bong (Richard Kind), a smaller answer to 'Dexter's Laboratory's Koosalagoopagoop, as their guide, before Fear (who looks like a purple version of Lord Starchbottom from 'The 7D'), Anger and Disgust mess anything up. On the way, Joy learns that she can't change Sadness, and she doesn't need to.
The animation in Riley's mind is lively, fun and creative. The writing is sharp as a tack and very funny. It also teaches an important lesson to children, that it's okay to be sad and it's part of expressing feelings healthily. Conclusively, sad memories are nothing to be ashamed of, and don't get in the way of happy ones. It's a powerful, profound, entertaining film and is essential viewing."
" Very good movie
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,9,"It has problems but its great! Ending made me cry over and over, and i watched this movie 3 or 4 times! Really good 8/10"
" Brilliant movie for the whole family!
",2020-10-29 00:00:00,10,"This was a great film to watch with young kids. I was surrounded by kids ranging from 3 to 13, including myself (the eternal child). Interesting on how the different ages reacted and connected to the characters in the movie. It was a great way for the older kids to see their emotions (any emotion) being validated and expressed visually. It is a great movie for the whole family."
" This is awesome!
",2020-10-21 00:00:00,10,This is the best Pixar movie I've ever seen! This movie was truly a joy to watch.
" Ok, who the hell disliked this masterpiece?!
",2020-10-20 00:00:00,10,"Take off your nostalgic games and realize how masterful this movie is.This is one of the most creative animated movies I've seen. The creative team have so many creative and amazing ideas: a dream set, islands of personalities, abstract rooms, there's so much creativity put into this movie!I love the characters as well. All 5 emotions and Bing Bong are written so well and are so likeable, have so much personality, are fun to watch and part of that is the excellent voice acting. These actors clearly put so much effort and energy into the role.I also love the message of the movie and Joy gets an excellent character arc realizing that it's fine to not be happy. It's okay to express your true feelings; it's okay to be sad/angry etc.. It's part of the road to happiness. It's a great message to kids and everyone that I'm sure a lot of people can relate to. This leads to one of the most heart felt climaxes over."
" I who is in my 30s learned a lot from this movie.
",2020-10-13 00:00:00,9,"It was a great opportunity to look inside of how my emotion works. I got to reflect myself because I also repressed a lot of what's considered negative such as sadness, of course, depression, shame, anger, and hopelessness. However, this kind of repression can lead to collapse of 'personality islands'. This movie really patted my shoulder and told me expression of sadness is okay. Even though the animation film is misleadingly considered for kids, messages delivered in this film are deep and philosophical. At the same time, how the story is narrated is energetic, dynamic, witty, and absorbing. Joy's adventures to subconsciousness, abstract world, dreamland, and memory dump are very cute, funny, and exciting. Concurrently all these parts explain psychology of minds with great analogy.'Inside Out' is my psychology 101, and I learned that the expression of sadness is okay. It is just okay. You cannot underestimate the animation movie because the movies like this really consoles me, heals me, and enlightens me. It can change the rest of your life."
" Wow
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,10,This is my favourite movie ever. It touches my soul. It's simply beautiful. I can't find words big enough to tell you how wonderful it is.
" A Mature Pixar Flick
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,9,Inside Out is really good. What impresses me the most is how it handles mature elements like depression and how there can't be joy without sadness. This all comes into flow about the emotions of a child trying to deal with a move that changes her life. This story puts into light of how mental illness can happen and that it can be a real struggle to remember happy memories when everything just doesn't feel right like it used too. It felt so relatable and moving of how a big life change can be so tumultuous to anyone.
" ""Mind Over Matters""
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,8,"Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.This is a wonderfully little story of world building and exploration of the human mind through a young teen girl who is scare of the huge amount of change happening in her life. The parallel of internal struggle and outward reaction to adversity really sets this movie apart.The audience is literally taken on a exploration of the mind, and the story is not only fun, but capable of serious philosophical concepts. Because it exemplifies ""show, don't tell"" those conversations are compacted into palatable actions by the characters.This is a movie that might make you laugh, cry or both.It's hard to believe that someone wouldn't relate to this somehow, and probably more that they wouldn't enjoy it at all."
" Pixar's best idea
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,10,I Loved this movie it was very emotional and very colourful it was very clever joy and sadness where my favourite characters in the film the ending is very sad and it's a fun movie and it's also very entertaining so would definitely recommend it to anybody because it's a fab movie. best animated movie of 2015
" Emotions explained
",2020-09-10 00:00:00,10,This movie explains the purpose of each emotion in a way that small children and adults can understand. The lessons me and my children have learned from this movie are invaluable. Animation can be so powerful sometimes.
" A funny, touching Disney Pixar.
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,7,A good little animated movie that takes many of the modern techniques of computerized animation and shows them off to full effect. It's a nice little story to and a family film of top quality. Many children's pictures come and go but this one will sure be remembered as one of the better ones and stand the test of time.
" Just missing something extra. Still enjoyed it though
",2020-09-02 00:00:00,7,"Sweet story.'Inside Out' produces an entertaining, heartfelt 95 minutes. I like how the characters work and how their world is set up, conceptually it works very nicely but visually I don't love it - something about the way it looks is kinda plain to me. While Joy & Co. are memorable, the voices behind them aren't all that standout in my opinion.Phyllis Smith is my pick of the cast, she is the perfect person to play the character Sadness. Amy Poehler (Joy) and Lewis Black (Anger) are more than satisfactory, too.It has a good message and meaning, for me it's just missing something extra. Still enjoyed it though."
" This is so much more than just a kids movie - its message and themes will resonate more with adults.
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,8,"It touches on human emotion, change, coming-of-age, and family. It's a bold, heartfelt, and gorgeously-animated film with a fantastically unique premise and well-fleshed out and emotional characters. The voice cast is superb and fit their respective characters perfectly."
" Good for sleeping

" this movie penetrates my heart so profoundly
",2020-08-25 00:00:00,10,"I have looked everywhere to find proper words to say about this breathtaking and gripping film. it's such a mixture of emotions that I felt while I was watching.
a great idea and the cast really presented the most imaginable way.
I rate this one of the best animation I have ever watched.
I could't think about anything expect melting visually this this beautiful art of animation. Also the music goes along with the scenes.
it reminded me of many things in my life as being abroad from my family and friends
I remember being with them so I kind understood what this film is trying to show
the scene where bing bong says those farewell words to joy touched my soulThank you for this masterpiecesayonra"
" Simply amazing
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,10,"One of the best animated movies ever made.
Emotionally touching and will bring back your memories from every situation you have been through as a kid and teenager."
" One of Pixar's best
",2020-08-17 00:00:00,9,"Amazing.One thing that bugs me is that Pixar (and Ghibli films as well) movies are not ""made for kids"". They are movies made for all ages. This is a film that not only teaches kids about the importance of embracing sadness and other emotions into their life, but also teaching teens and adults the same lesson.The writing, as mentioned above, is very impressive.In an incredibly emotional and humorous adventure through the mind, the audience and Joy learn the importance of embracing sadness into our life. In The Lego Movie (2014), there was a character called Unikitty - and she was the embodiment of pure positivity and optimism. Joy is a very similar character and the film challenges the notion of ""Positive Vibes Only"". She undergoes a vital change as she then realises that life (or even a good life, rather) is not going to be populated with only happy memories. I read somewhere that people who experience severe physical or psychological trauma are able to experience extremely high forms of happiness; so Joy has to learn that if Riley wants to be truly happy, she needs to embrace not just memories and experiences of happiness and sadness, but the other emotions also. The film deals with this message in an incredible delicate yet skilled manner.Quite a swift topic change but - I have never been depressed in my life, but from my understanding, depression isn't an intense amount of sadness or a lack of happiness. It's a hollow feeling, and you encounter an intense lack of hope and optimism for the future. When Joy and Sadness leave the Headquarters, Riley enters a stage of depression. It was nice to see that the filmmakers had an actually good grasp on that sort of topic - but once again, I have never been actually depressed so this is just an outsider's perspective.Overall, this is a fantastic film. I found myself laughing a lot, this is one of the funniest Pixar films, but in my opinion has the most deserving laughs: they really nail comedic timing and line delivery etc. Nice to see Pixar evolving in other areas you wouldn't think. Loved the themes and lessons that come with it, and was an extremely engaging and compelling story. Bravo to everyone at Pixar."
" Get the tissues ready...

",2020-08-09 00:00:00,8,"This is one of the best animated films I've seen. The concept is very fresh, tons of great characters, though I wish Disgust, Anger and Fear had bigger roles in the film. Anyway, this film is an adventures with great character development. Highly recommended."

" Pixar magic strikes again
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,10,"I was surprised to read some of the bad reviews. People who have those reviews completely misunderstood the point of this movie. Pixar has always done movies with a more real to life emotional connection than compared to the usual Disney princess sing a long material. Their creativity behind this is truly amazing as we all go through with life with certain emotion taking over the other at times and they have a huge role to play in our personality development through life and events. Another amazing strike from Pixar again and in the next few decades to come, this will be remembered as one of the gems in the Pixar's crown!"
" Pixar's cleverest and certainly the richest story ever told
",2020-07-23 00:00:00,10,"'Inside Out' is a powerful film that makes you feel all of the emotions you see on screen. The film takes you from laughing out loud, to thinking hard trying to figure out what they meant when they said or did that thing, and it also takes you to very deep and sad moments that will cause you to tear up in a heart beat. Perhaps the cleverest and certainly the richest story ever told by the folks who've shown us how toys, robots, and clownfish think. A masterpiece."
" Inside Out
",2020-07-21 00:00:00,7,"Maybe the animated characters are not so likable, but the whole movie is full of imagination. It seems to give rationality to many ideas and behaviors in our daily lives. This should be a cartoon for adults, and many sections will only be more emotional when we grow up."
" A Modern Pixar Movie To Stand With The Classics, Even When Its Manipulation Starts To Wear.
",2020-07-15 00:00:00,8,"Inside Out is the best Pixar has been in years. Exciting, original, and pretty funny, with a thoughtful core to the idea of the secret world of emotions, Inside Out is the first and only Pixar movie of the 2010s worthy of standing alongside the studio's classics. In comparison to Monsters University or Finding Dory, which seemed so small, tv-like, and insignificant, Inside Out feels like the real deal. A big, theatrical, Pixar event. The movie is not up there in the upper tier of the catalogue, but it comes from approximately the same creative place.I have a theory about Pixar movies. At their core, they are ""secret life of _______ movies"". The secret life of toys, bugs, monsters, fish, superheroes, cars, rats and robots. That's why Up and Brave have always felt like slight outliers in the canon to me. Inside Out is about the secret life of emotions. Colorful personifications of Joy, Fear, Sadness, Anger, and Disgust, voiced by Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Bill Hader, Lewis Black and Mindy Kaling, run the mind of young Riley. On a Star Trek-ian bridge, the emotions squabble over the controls, each thinking they know what is best for their host. The world-building goes much deeper, however, with the writers, led by Pete Docter and Ronnie Del Carmen, constantly exploring new, creative visualizations for how our minds work. This is the best part of Inside Out. The level of ambition in the screenplay is impressive. Every aspect of thought, memory, anxiety, or nostalgia is given a surprising place in this animated world. There's a strong sense of discovery along the emotions' journey. The parade of truly entertaining gags are always operating on multiple levels, almost like a satire of the brain. It's kind of genius.Although, I did say that Inside Out doesn't reach the height of early 2000s Pixar. Enter Pixar Theory Number 2: Since Toy Story 3, the animation studio has shifted their approach to storytelling. In short, Pixar has become self-aware. The filmmakers recognize that their films are known for bringing up tears from every man, woman, and child who sees them. And so, they have bought into the meme. Inside Out has been designed from the ground up around making people cry. That's not how the great Pixar movies operated. Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Monster's Inc. and the rest were built around an entertaining story first. The emotional appeal of those films was hidden within the entertainment. The trend with the newer Pixar movies is to do the opposite. To turn the storytelling ""inside out"". Start with an idea that will make people cry, and try to build something entertaining around it. Inside out is the perfect example of how powerful and also uncomfortable this method can be. You are always aware that you are being played; that the filmmakers are more interested in getting a rise out of your softer sensibilities than they are in telling you a story.That's not to say the approach doesn't technically work. The movie did its job. It made me emotional. I just wish I didn't notice quite as much. Still, the level of quality, entertainment value, and importantly, passion in Inside Out is so much higher than its contemporaries. Here is a movie that lives up to the Pixar standard of original, stimulating, fun.84/100"
" There are better Pixars
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,6,"It a nice, safe family film, and there's nothing wrong with that, it just didn't gel with me. I might me too old, but I enjoy other kids films just fine so I'm unsure as to why I didn't enjoy this film more. It might be that I found the protagonist annoying, I also didn't find some of jokes very funny. The animation and world design is good, but that's expected of Pixar, there's just something about this film that makes just OK."
" An imaginative animated film.
",2020-07-09 00:00:00,9,"The most surprising thing is not the interaction of the five emotions, but the visualization of the island of personality, core memory, abstract thinking and dream factory that affect personality and emotion. The setting of memory ruins is too tearful. Those forgotten islands and all the collapsed islands are the price of our growth."

",2020-06-14 00:00:00,10,"I absolutely love this movie
I've seen it countless timesIt's well written with a great story all star cast and stunning visual effects
The analysis of each emotion is well represented and is very relatable to Riley's age.I'm not sure why this movie gets a lot of hate but it's a fantastic movie and I highly recommend it"
" I fell asleeep.
",2020-06-13 00:00:00,2,This film is the most boring I've watched in my life.
" Why did people rate this so bad??
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,10,"I must be missing something as to why people are rating the movie ""Inside Out"" so badly. I am a 11 year old kid, and I did not find anything wrong with Inside Out. In movies, there is this thing called SET UP in the beginning or middle so that there is another thing called PAY OFF in the end. GOOD movies use this so that there can actually be something to watch.And so what if Riley makes a mistake deciding that it is okay to run away? Everyone makes mistakes, especially characters in movies. If you gave Inside Out a bad review, then you need to watch it again. All in all, Pixar's ""Inside Out"" is a good movie, and deserves to be watched. This is all coming from an 11 year old."
" MORAL OF THE ENTIRE SCREENPLAY
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,6,"Its the SADNESS which when comes over u , u will be more closer to ur loved ones . since actually thats what their role is in our life ( being with us when time is just opposite of what we actually wanted )
good movie for kiddos."
" Amazing ideas, wonderful stories
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,9,"Pixar's films are always surprising in their creativity, and the story is full of twists and turns and touching. The five emotions in the human brain are abstracted out to personify, ""Lele"" will always be happy and full of vitality, ""Youyou"" will always be full of negative emotions. This pair is like a contradiction, but in the end, they work together to overcome the difficulties. It's great."

" Not bad.
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,8,"This movie was better than I thought. Suspenseful and holds the interest throughout the entire movie. Good ending as it brings almost everything together. Some things I was still puzzled about, but all in all I love movies like this."
" Grow up
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,8,"There are some good things that you have to slowly forget. This is the law of nature. However, they have not really disappeared. They have merged with our souls. The past is not going back, but we can write a completely different ending from now on. We will grow old, but our heart will not change."
" Could've been much better
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,5,"Personally, I thought that this movie would have been better if it spent more time in development. I mean, the idea was clever but it just did not turn out well. I did not like Reilly or any of the other emotions as they were annoying and so unlikeable. Joy is very selfish and annoying, Sadness is so irritating, the other emotions are just plain annoying. Also, Reilly has no personality. Yes, we do see her ""islands"" but if you watch the Reilly only scenes of the movie, you will notice that she is so bland and also selfish. Seriously, you are not in quarantine, Reilly! I also disliked the story. In the beginning, the introduction was so long and the story was so slow.
I also noticed that during the whole story, Joy and Sadness did the same thing over and over again throughout most of the movie: 1) Get to Island X. 2)Something happens to Reilly. 3) Island falls. 4) Go through random obstacles to get to the next one. I also disliked the messages the movie was trying to teach kids:1) You are not responsible for your actions. 2) You have no control over your life. 3) If your sad, your problems will be solved if you look sad. People will come and sort it out and you will feel joy again.Overall, while I did not care for the story, I thought that the idea was clever and the animation was great."
" Move
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,7,"It's beautiful, but I can't think of a cartoon that could make me cry in tears and tears from beginning to end. Not to say how sad, but moved from the bottom of my heart. It will evoke many memories of you, those family and love, unforgettable (or forgotten) memories, everything is so real and delicate, and it is presented on the basis of such an imaginative story. In the end it is still growth and farewell. Really convinced."
" Imaginative movie
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,9,"A very imaginative film, with Lele in the brain returning to the brain headquarters, and Riley outside the brain running away from home as the main line, both story lines are very exciting, anthropomorphizing the emotions in the mind and each Functions.What I like most is the story line in my head, very imaginative. The dream factory shows how dreams are produced, just like making a movie, there is a complete crew. Abstract thinking is also very interesting, vivid Explained what is dimensionality reduction. It seems to be omnipotent in Fantasyland. The final turning point is very interesting. Lele 's favorite core memory (that is, the part where Riley is with his teammates) is actually triggered by worry. Riley didn't hit the most critical ball that day and lost the game, feeling very frustrated and sad, so teammates and parents came to comfort Riley, Lele saw only the second half before. Lele saw, only then Feeling worried is not just a burden, it is also indispensable to Riley.The 5 emotions (happiness, fear, anger, disgust, anxiety) in the film were proposed by the psychologist consultant Paul Ekman of this film. In fact, he thinks that people's emotions are also surprising, enjoyment, etc., but it is not good in the film Show. I did not find Barbara Fredrickson as a consultant. She believes that people have 18 emotions, the most important thing is love, but this is difficult to anthropomorphize.The film also shows the positive effect of negative emotions. Finally, Riley, who lost all emotions, can go home, just by worrying. Negative emotions are also useful. For example, when encountering dangerous things, they will be fearful, prompting people to escape from danger; Feeling angry when being violated, being able to attack or demonstrate to others; sadness can make people cope with the loss of important people / things, can also get comfort from others, etc.However, too much negative emotions can lead to depression, too much positive emotions can cause people to underestimate danger. Negative emotions and positive emotions, the two should reach a balance, Barbara Fredrickson has a metaphor, positive emotions are like a boat For sails, negative emotions are like anchors. For large sails, small anchors can only be rotated in place; for small anchors, large sails can easily turn over."

" Very good
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,10,I really liked it. Recommend. Love it. itrs very interesting and there are some funny lines in this movie.
" Great concept from a film by Pixar
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,8,"Brilliant from Pixar as usual 😊 many of the ideas are very relatable.
Great cast made up of people from the office and parks and recreation. Amy pouler is an excellent choice for joy"
" Inside out
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,10,"I did exactly what I was supposed to when watching this brilliant movie, I felt all the emotions at some point.Pixar did it again with Inside Out. For a long time I had stubbornly repeated that Toy Story would always be my favourite from Pixar, but I changed my mind shortly after watching this one.Like Toy Story you were offered a setup every adult can identify. Growing up learning how to control your feelings and learning the importance of every one of them. It is okay to be angry, sad, happy and afraid as long as we are taught how to manage them.The idea of having this control panel inside a human body has been done before by Osmosis Jones (2001), but let's say with much less success. Inside out takes it to the highest level of perfection.I loved the way Pixar made this world inside the main character of Riley, it is very creatively done and was in some ways just how I had imagined it. I must admit that I cried a couple of times during the movie, because it has some really touching moments.You should be feeling all emotions when watching Inside Out. It is a must watch."
" The way your mind works!
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,10,I have gone on imdb everyday for years and this is my first review I have ever written. This movie truly touches your soul. It is a great way to look at your feelings and why you maybe feel the way you do some times. For kids this movie will be funny and maybe they will be able to relate to it during some parts. As an adult this movie is truly touching. Me and my wife started to cry with how beautiful it was. It is a great example of a way to use CBT Therapy for your mental health. Imagine this is going on in your head each day and try to visualize it like this beautiful movie. Wow what an amazing movie. I have not seen one that truly touches your soul like this in a long time.
" What is life ah - - joy and sad intersection
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,9,"Today, I saw a Disney animated movie called Inside Out.Before that, I thought it was an underage animated movie, but after watching ,it really hit me! This movie is so vivid and close to life that you can even find a shadow of your childhood in it. It taught me a lesson:The taste of life is mixed, not only happiness is important, every emotion has its place. It is these rich emotions that make our life more exciting.I cried when the Bing Bong was forgotten! And here, I want to say thank you to all the people who passed by my life, memories that flickered and faded and were forgotten: Thank you for appearing in my life . What is life ah - - joy and sad intersection."
" It Never Entered My Mind
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,5,"I don't know but sometimes I felt as if I needed a degree in psychology to fully join up the thought processes which not only went together to create this acclaimed Disney / Pixar movie but also that went on inside the mind of the animated young girl Riley at the centre of the action.Ambitious it certainly was, attempting the fine balance which all Pixar films strive to achieve between providing the cartoon fun beloved of young children and the sophistication demanded of the adult who more than likely has to accompany their child to the movie. I don't know if the five key emotions identified and depicted here of joy, sadness, disgust, fear and anger would be the ones I'd identify as primary to a pre-teen child, and once joy and sadness exited their main functions, I struggled a little to explain some of the motivations and choices made by the three remaining, competing feelings.Again maybe it's me but I also didn't quite follow either the journey of the two dominant emotions back to the central cortex as it were and wondered a little if some of the characters they met along the way weren't just inserted for promotional tie-in purposes. I'd also argue that every child experiences a different mind-set as they grow up and didn't accept the applied generalised psychoanalysis here.Okay, maybe all this means that cynicism would be one of the guiding traits in my own mind but even in the wider picture the film didn't really reach out to me in the usual Pixar manner in terms of humour or emotion. There were occasional humorous but not hilarious moments and certainly some lovely and lively animation to see but for me it all went a little above my head leaving my mind-set at the end in neutral."
" I loved it!
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,8,Exceeded my expectations. Very creative story. Awesome cast. I really liked this one. Favorite Pixar movie so far.
" Childhood depression made quirky and interesting
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,7,"It's hard to simplify Inside Out into a few sentences. We follow a girl called Riley and the emotions in her head. Riley moves cross country from Minnesota to San Francisco. This has a mental impact on her and it unleashes havoc in her brain. The emotions have to get their act together before Riley falls into a permanent state of depression and causes irreparable damage to her brain.Inside Out is fantastic. There are so many fantastic touches added into this movie. I love that the emotions in the mother's head resemble the panel on the View. I love the dream sequence. I love the scene where the mind workers are deleting the memories that Riley doesn't need anymore. It is made with the same thought that was put into Monsters Inc and Finding Nemo.The message from the movie is entirely wholesome. I think it's a great message to give children that it is okay to feel more than one way about an event. We can't always be happy and always be angry. Inside Out shows us the issues with this. The only message that this movie proports that I am not so fond of is that the movie seems to say that when you are depressed, you are emotionless. You can be happy and depressed. You can also be angry and depressed. You can also be scared and depressed. Depression is more of a feeling of dejection and despondency, than it is emotionless.The ending is phenomenal. The scene where Riley enters the home actually made me feel so incredibly sad and happy at the same time. It is truly great cinema. Very impressed at Pixar pulling this off again. It puts itself on a list with Finding Nemo, Up and Toy Story 3.So why only a 7? While the plot of the real world Riley and the added touches Pixar throws in are great, the story of Joy trying to get back to headquarters is not as good. We fall into a repetition of ""there's only one way back to headquarters"" then ""oh no, that was destroyed, now we can't get back"" then ""there's only one other way back to headquarters"". This repeats about five times. It just got a little one note and, although it didn't become predictable, none of the revelations felt overwhelming.Overall, very much worth the watch. I cannot wait to rewatch it again. Great for kids and adults alike."
" It helps you understand
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,10,"Its exactly what every person should watch to understand better what is going on inside their head.How important are emotions when dealing with crisis - Not applicable only on childhood, but adulthood life situations also!"
" Life is like a dish, and emotions are like condiments
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,9,"Some seasonings are unpalatable when tasted alone, but once it is properly added to the dishes with other seasonings, the dishes will become delicious. These spices are like emotions: sadness. As we grow older, we will gradually mature and may forget the beautiful fantasy of childhood. Just like a popsicle that disappeared in the valley floor. This is a normal phenomenon, not that we no longer love those things, but that we know more, understand more, and fall in love with other things."
" Key of happiness
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,8,This movie was so interesting you must watch if you are below 15 years. Such great movie with lovely message it will help you in your entire life just watch and learn it had great time while watching by the way i am 22 years old now but find movie so masterpiece.
" This movie was special to me
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,9,"For me, this cartoon is one of those cartoons worth watching in life. Since I'm not a kid any more, but something has remained in my mind since that time, that is why this movie was special to me."
" The Most Emotionally Resonant Pixar Film
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,8,"When listing the PIXAR films that have the most emotional resonance, the films I hear mentioned most often are TOY STORY 3, WALL-E and the first 20 minutes of UP. While all of those are most definitely emotionally resonant, I would argue that INSIDE OUT is the most emotionally resonant of all the Pixar films.And not just because the main characters in the film are emotions.Telling the tale of 11 year old Riley, who's life is upended when her family moves from Minnesota to San Fransico, INSIDE OUT follows this journey through the eyes of Riley's 5 chief emotions - Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust and Fear.As is customary in Pixar films, the voice cast in this film is outstanding. Amy Poehler (well known as the ever-optimistic Leslie Knope in the marvelous TV Series PARKS & RECREATION) is perfectly cast as Joy. Her never ending well of optimism is perfectly placed - and never gets tiresome. As does the voice work of Lewis Black (Anger), Bill Hader (Fear) and Mindy Kahling (Disgust). They are all marvelous. But the revelation of this film for me is the voicework of Phyllis Smith (THE OFFICE) as Sadness. She brings just the right amount of weight and...well...sadness...to her character without bogging down (and bringing down) the proceedings. These 5 work together well (especially Poehler and Smith).Special notice needs to be made of the voice work of the unique talent that is Richard Kind as the character BingBong. I will not ruin any of the surprise of this character, but I will say I could not think of any other voice for this character - he is that perfect for it.Credit, of course, for all of this needs to be given to Director Pete Docter (currently the Chief Creative Officer at Pixar). He has shown he has the ability to really tug at the heartstrings with his previous Pixar effort, UP, and he expands on this promise in this film bringing an emotionally rich film that has many, many moments of humor spliced within. He'll be at the helm of the upcoming SOUL and I can't wait to see it.I'm glad I revisited INSIDE OUT, it is a stronger, better film than I remembered. You'll like it - and your kids will, too!Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"
" Genuine
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,10,"This is not only one of the best animated films of the year, it's one of the best films of the year, period. I'm glad to see Pixar slowly returning to form, by making charming, original films for the whole family. I've noticed that they've evolved from making movies that were considered ""kids films"" and going into deeper, more complex themes. As the audience who first saw Toy Story in 1995 (20 years ago) has grown up, so have Pixar's movies grown up with them. Pixar does the impossible. They make films for older audiences, while at the same time keeping them appropriate for the children who want to see it. We all know that this will win Best Animated Film at the Oscars next year simply because it has the Pixar name attached to it, but this is one of those times where I agree. (So far. That may change, because we still have Minions, Hotel Transylvania 2, Peanuts, and Pixar's next film The Good Dinosaur coming out this year.) I enjoyed the more subtle bits of humor for older audiences, that 10 years from now kids will rewatch this film and say ""oh, now I get it."" I thought I would be able to predict the plot, but the movie proved me wrong. I was not able to predict any of the plot other than what was shown in the trailers. This is one of Pixar's best. It makes up for Brave and Cars 2. I liked those, just not as much. I wouldn't say those are their best. This movie made me very emotional. (No pun intended) It's definitely a film that little kids won't appreciate as much as older audiences, because it's so deep. There is also a short before the movie called ""Lava"" about 2 volcanoes who fall in love. I thought that was great, too. The whole story was told through an island song which I felt was very unique. That definitely deserves some Oscar love too in the Best Animated Short category.Grade: A+ 10/10 5/5 stars"
" A creative but warm film
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,9,"The plot of this movie is very creative, which makes five kinds of emotions in people's brain appear vividly in front of everyone.I especially like the two characters of joy and worry. Joy is always happy, and youyou always looks blue.Through the vivid interpretation of five emotional characters, the audience can feel the warmth of family"
" Beautiful Story
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,10,Inside Out is a captivating film that I would describe as a Cinematic Masterpiece. Everyone should watch this.
" A magnific animation

" Pixar never fails.
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,9,"That's the first time you realize that life isn't just about joy, that everything has its opposite, that memories that were once important are forgotten, that growth that was once so important is lost in ignorance.The first time to accept the incomplete, the first time to know how to hold how will be imperfect continue to walk carefully.An amazing theme, a plot-free plotline, and a pixar that never fails."
" Happiness and sorrow are neighbors
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,8,"The movie tells the story of a girl named Leili and the emotions inside her head. Leili had lived happily in Minnesota, with loving parents, close friends, and a passion for hockey. Suddenly one day the family moved to San Francisco because of his father's work, but because the new home was not good, they left their friends, and Leili felt terrible about her new life. So Leili decided to run away and go back to Minnesota, where she had been happy, but in the end Leili called it off before the bus left and returned to her new home. This is the real world story of Leili, while in Leili's mind the five emotional villains lead to another series of stories to save Leili from the change of mood from joy to depression and anger. The film has its own artistic originality and fantasy, but it is also worth exploring in psychology, especially in the aspects of emotion, memory and dream."
" Masterpiece
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,10,"I saw this film in my room alone... on my pc...with my headphones ....and when it ended...there were tears in my eyes and I clapped for at least a minute ,literally....I was completely overwhelmed by this film ...I couldn't control my two actions that I described above...it came directly from my soul.... amazing movie... looking for more such work from their creators..."
" This is one of the most brilliant movies I've ever seen.
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,8,"The movie inside out has a unique way to teach us about how to deal with our emotions. It is a good movie because it is cute and adorable. ""This movie is the best! It's emotional, funny, has GREAT animation and more!"" (Bozdech, 2015). I think this is a movie that everyone should watch.I like it when they show Riley as a little girl and she is very happy and sassy. There is this part where Riley is running around the house and being a little sassy girl because she doesn't want to have her clothes changed. I like it because they have all these happy cute memories of Riley when she was so little and they show it at the beginning of the movie. One of Riley's cutest moments was when Riley's parents were teaching her how to play hockey on the ice and both of her parents were so happy that Riley was going to grow up playing ice hockey. Another cute moment was when Riley had an imaginary friend named Bing Bong who was pink like cotton candy and they always played together and they had a song that would start the wheelbarrow and fly into the air and they played an instrument together. Riley has a good imagination and she loves spending time with her friends and going out with them.For me, I rate this movie a 8/10 because this move is good and it is cute at the beginning and it shows you how to express your emotions. It is the best movie in the world and I recommend this movie to someone who wants to watch it to see how it is because the movie is so cute and adorable and you would cry when you watch it because some parts are emotionally good."
" The great Pixar
",2020-03-19 00:00:00,8,"Pixar's first animation without villains is also its boldest work. Under the young adventure story for children, the whole film is full of extraordinary imagination and creativity from life that only adults can experience, core memory, personality island, abstract space, dream studio, subconscious prison. Forgetting the abyss, and as always, laughter and emotion make it more successful to squeeze into the pixar TOP."
" Awesome movie with real life situations
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,10,"This movie was great it shows all of the emotions of what pre teens,teens and adults go through.It was funny and sad at the same time.I loved it, it shows you can't be one emotion your whole life.It also shows your life can't be the same,in life things change that's a part of growing up.Definitley a must watch for pre teens,teens, and adults"
" Pixar Rocks!
",2020-03-17 00:00:00,10,This movie never fails to put a smile on my face. The imagination is wild yet makes a lot of sense. There was a moment that I bought the whole story and started to think there might truly be 5 little person inside my brain.
" Inside Out, best Pixar movie of the 2010s
",2020-03-16 00:00:00,8,"I feel a lot of people misunderstood this movie when it first came out. Sure it's dark and moody and you witness the crumbling of an 11 year old girls personality quirks and interests, but the thing is that this movie does make sense when it comes to the emotions of a girl who had her life suddenly turned upside down and how she would have to deal with it. I do like the way this movie ends and the message it gives to whoever watches it, you're not alone. Is it completely scientifically accurate to how a preteen girl or boy thinks? no, but it is the most entertaining and interesting movie about how the mind and emotion works that I have seen in recent memory, are there other kids movies like this? maybe I've forgottenAll jokes aside I think this movie is going to be studied and talked about more and more as time goes on. Well done Pixar"
" A total roller coaster of emotions.
",2020-03-12 00:00:00,10,"I love it. While the idea of the story is so complex, and there are two stories happening at the same time, the manage to put them together wonderfully. Yes, kids can watch this -I don't get why parents are being so whiny about it, like if kids are not aloud to fantasize of people living in their brains for two hours...-.Like my headline says, I cried, laughed, worried and cried again. Wonderful meaning, excellent animation (I mean, Pixar...), and a cozy ambience all around. I recommend it for a Sunday night at bed with family.SPOILERS AHEAD (kind off):I also remembered what it was like to grow up, learn about feelings and discover that life is more than just laughter. For me, the meaning of the movie is, that, which I already knew, that happiness isn't about only fun, neither Is love and friendship, but it's about a cluster of feelings and learning about them and acknowledging them. Success in everything is also built by tears, passion, sweat and desperation."
" Another jewel in Pixar's crown
",2020-03-07 00:00:00,8,"There was a lot of hype surrounding Inside Out, which seems to be a contender for the upper echelons of Pixar's creations, and I can see why. The imagination of the gang at Pixar never ceases to amaze me, and their ability to make seemingly innocuous ideas into masterpieces is wildly admirable.Like any Pixar film the voice acting was spot on, and Inside Out really delivered with some fantastic voices to personify the emotions running around in Riley's mind. Amy Poehler was a fantastic lead, bringing her exuberance to the role perfectly.In terms of the plot it was rather subtle in delivering some fantastic messages regarding emotions and how it is healthy and part of growth to feel sadness. The journey of discovery that Joy and Sadness went on was jovial and poignant simultaneously. The world that Pixar created inside the mind of Riley was great, with some fantastic and ingenious ideas in how to portray memory and brain functions.What perhaps brings this film down slightly for me is how contained it is as a world, and how few characters there are. The story spends a large amount of time focusing on Joy and Sadness, and a bit of attention on some of the other characters or a few additional ones would have been welcome.Aside from this there isn't much to complain about with Inside Out. A joyous way to spend an hour and a half and another great addition to Pixar's arsenal."
" Enjoyed it more than I was expecting
",2020-03-03 00:00:00,8,"Yeesh, this movie is actually far deeper than I was expecting it to be. Was not expecting this many {feels}. (Get it?)Really great movie for kids and adults. An instant Disney classic.4/5."
" PERFECTION!
",2020-03-01 00:00:00,10,This is one of my absolute favorite Pixar films! I have cried multiple times and I have watched it over and over! It NEVER gets old!
" Watched it as an adult and loved it
",2020-02-26 00:00:00,10,"I thought the complexity of the emotions were spot on and I really enjoyed it. I wanted to punch sadness in the beginning but all was forgiven by the end.
I laughed, I cried and I am a fan."
" Heartbreakingly honest film.
",2020-02-15 00:00:00,8,"Inside Out is a film about the loss of one's childhood and happiness. Filtered through a innocent children's film, it limits itself from reaching true potential with this concept, yet it still contains many incredibly real themes. The biggest of which being Joy's arc of allowing sadness to take control. Anyone who is happy 100% of the time is either lying to them self, or a sociopath, and this film acknowledges this a couple times in heartfelt scenes.
The concept and world they built inside of a human brain is very broad and interesting. There is enough within it to where they could easily make a just as emotional sequel, yet I don't think they will end up doing this anytime soon.
Overall this is a very emotional and real film that may or may not make you cry."

" Worst movie I've ever seen (seriously)
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,1,"Awful music, pathetic humour, irritating characters, a preposterous concept, confusing plot points, and a boring thrill ride all mixed together. I am actually completely serious when I say Inside Out is my most hated movie of all time."
" A brilliant example of how to do a kids film.
",2019-12-31 00:00:00,9,"Rewatched this for the 3rd or 4th time in 3d, and the visuals and animations are a thing of beauty alone. The character design is amazing, and the locations are equally impressive. As for the storytelling, thier isn't an ounce of fat on it. The story flows perfectly, and every line of dialogue has a purpose. The portrait of depression described in a way kids can understand is not only very well written and executed, but an important and simple way to explain a very tough topic. A perfect tearjerker."
" Great movie.
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,8,"Emotional, complicated, and childish; Inside Out is a really impressive movie. Even so, it's not the best movie I've ever seen. 8/10."
" A ROLLER COASTER OF EMOTIONS.
",2019-12-26 00:00:00,10,"One of the most ambitious concept by Pixar. Made an abstract emotions in a narrations are so hard, but everything in this film are perfect. A roller coaster of emotions and universal experience but personal. Great."
" Destined to be a classic
",2019-12-12 00:00:00,9,"Inside Out, from director Pete Docter, is in my opinion the best movie Pixar has made so far. And this is Pixar we're talking about so that's saying something.And it's not just because it's an engaging family friendly film where colourfully animated, fun-sized friends go on adventures together to get back home. Although, it is. It's not because it's gorgeously animated, and has some amazing textures, character designs and visual puns. Although, it is, and it has.It's not even because it's a great story about growing up, learning to live in a new situation and remembering what's most important. Although, it most definitely is.No, what separates Inside Out from other great Pixar films, from other great animated films in general, is how well it speaks about emotions, about their importance, about their nuance. This is a movie, which those people who are kids now and will grow up to become adults, will name as one of those movies that shaped them. Taught them, for example, that's it's okay to be sad. Essential even because how else would you feel empathy.Personally I learned a lot watching The Lion King as a child. I learned about responsibility and trust. And I learned about the concept of death, about loss. And it was a good lesson.This movie is on par with The Lion King. Better even in some ways. The story is perhaps not as engaging, but the morals and the lessons have even more impact.A gem of a movie and hopefully we'll see more movies of this quality out of Pixar in the years to come."
" Watch it before you die !
",2019-12-01 00:00:00,10,"I think every teenager should watch this movie at least once in his lifetime. Starting from childhood to teenager, a human being undergoes several phases in his life and this movie clearly depicts them well. Various reasons behind depression, anxiety and mental disorders are also mentioned here along with some deep message for life. At last (happiness + sadness =life)"
" A perfect Movie!
",2019-11-26 00:00:00,10,I never expected a movie can be both fun and poinful thank you for this movie it made my day OMG! I love it I love every single second in it ! Thanks a million !!!!
" 6.5 movie for kids under 10years
",2019-11-25 00:00:00,7,The movies has classic normal story and it is designed for kids..... teenagers and older people may will not like this movie
" One of the best Pixar movies!
",2019-11-17 00:00:00,10,"The music, colors and over all feel of this movie is so nice. there are a few emotional scenes that really pull at the heart strings. I have watched this movie with my girls over and over and it never gets old."
" A Good Film if a little Traumatic for Me
",2019-11-16 00:00:00,7,"This is an amazing feat by Pixar... A film that focuses on Teenage Mental Health! It is an excellent idea and I am so glad that this has been brought to light in this way...However, this film traumatised me completely! As a Depression sufferer, whose first experience with the debilitating illness was when I was 13 and spiralled down the suicide track when I was 14 this movie brought all of those feeling back and turned me into a blubbering mess for days!It is an absolutely brilliant portrayal of how the emotions react in a teenage brain... Joy is brilliant at keeping everyone in check, then Sadness infects affects everything... Which truly happens!I don't think I'd ever watch this film again but I do recommend it to others... Just be aware that it can bring on very intense emotions!"
" Brilliant
",2019-11-16 00:00:00,10,This movie has taken Family Cinema to a new level. Those who rated it poorly just aren't deep enough to appreciate the psychological depth of this masterpiece.

",2019-11-03 00:00:00,1,"If you'd ask me even if designed for children and.... the movies is simply bad.... simply boring and too emotional...
i mean we get it it's a movie about emotions but everything feels over done
predictable boring empty...the ending was good and a bit funny in a sence
but not enought to save from a 1 stareverything about the plot felt like it was over tought and very poorly...
from the chalanges and path and.... it simply feels like it could have bring so much better...and while i generally don't like movies of this kind and it is for children nd i took that into account
most movies of this type are for me... ""sufferable""
but this one was such a cliche was so boring such a pain to watch that i simply regred watching it at all...
boring if you'd ask me... your kids might like it maybe not but in the end of the day there are much better alternatives and...to be fair the movie does look good visually... with good animations and..... but that's more of a technological thing...whn i was a child movies weren't really like that... and that's a good aspect...
yet movies for children from my time were better.....
with better stories and u know..............................."
" Creative and original - an instant classic
",2019-10-30 00:00:00,10,Rating10/10A welcome return to peak form for Pixar with a highly creative and original story which builds to a impactful conclusion. More suitable for slightly older kids. An instant classic.
" A RARE GEM ! MUST WATCH !!
",2019-10-27 00:00:00,10,"The success of any movie depends directly on its ability to forge an emotional connect between the characters who inhabit the movie and the viewer. The greater we feel with / for a character, identify / empathise with their predicaments, feelings, choices and actions, the higher the chances of a movie's success. What if the main characters in a movie are the basic emotions themselves..? Would it make it easier or difficult to forge an emotional connect with such a movie ?Pixar, the path-breaking animation studio that presented us with such classic delights such as Toy Story series, Finding Nemo, Wall E, Up and many more have explored the above question in their latest ambitious animated feature, Inside Out. When 11-year old Riley, is forced to relocate from Minnesota to San Francisco with her parents, she undergoes an emotional roller-coaster as she is stressed out in adjusting to a new place even as she misses her hitherto dear home and friends. The movie captures this emotional turmoil of Riley by exploring the working of her mind through the interactions between her five basic emotions of Joy (a chirpy Amy Poehler), Sadness (adorable Phyllis Smith), Anger (Lewis Black), Fear (Bill Hader) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling).While the movie deserves kudos for its high quality and vivid animation which we have come to expect from Pixar, what makes it tick is the fact that Director Pete Doctor (Up & Monsters Inc.) who has co-written this movie has conjured up a magical movie which works at so many levels. He presents a lively animated feature which breaches the hitherto accepted horizons of its genre to bravely explore the abstract world of mind and emotions, angst, existential crisis and depression. The movie succeeds mainly from its sheer brilliance in writing which successfully communicates, without compromising on an iota of entertainment value, the nature of every emotion,their behavioural outcomes, their utility and prominence in the larger scheme of our lives, the need to accept all of them as well as the need to strive towards a balance among them. Multiple abstract concepts which one would normally associate with psychology texts and self-help books such as formation of memories, transfer into and storage of long term memories, imagination, nostalgia, dreams, influence of emotions on memory, emotion - behaviour connect, loss of unused memory, repression, fears that fester in the subconscious, need for a balanced emotional state are presented through inventive and imaginative visuals in a sincere and heart warming manner.
Pixar has done what it does best.. Outdo Pixar.. in making the BEST animated features ever. This is an abundantly funny, yet, subtle, sensitive, profound and poignant movie that presents its inherently complex and abstract material in a lucid manner that appeals universally. It is a veritable treat which would satiate the appetite of every demographic one could imagine, effortlessly making each of them laugh and cry. Inside Out is a triumph in movie-making and am certain that it would find its place in the coveted club of everlasting classics in movie history.If there could be ONLY one movie that one would see this whole year... THIS IS IT ! THIS IS IT !!"
" Opinion & Review (Tumara)
",2019-10-17 00:00:00,9,"I was really excited when I first saw trailer for that movie. Colorful characters got my attention and I was ready to watch it in Local Cinema. Main characters' casts are Amy Poehler, Bill Hader, Lewis Black, Mindy Kaling, Ivana Wong as the emotions and Kaitlyn Dias as Riley.
Story starts from Riley's early ages of chilhood and how her emotions inside her head started their work. Complexity of emotions' work is explained and shown while main character, little and happy girl, is growing. Riley is rose by very responsible and good parents, but then some problems appear as she becomes a teenager. It is widely known that teenagers have complex mind and that movie shows how Riley is going through this time.
The movie itself is good directed and is full of colors. Every detail about chararistics is well-developed and clearly shown. Not only do people have emotions, but characters known as Emotions also do. Effects and backround sounds appeal viewers who loves to watch something with 'happy end'.
Movie is appropriate to watch with Family or alone - movie makes to feel warm feelings and helps to relax and fully penetrate to the reality of ""Inside Out""."
" Love it
",2019-10-08 00:00:00,10,This movie manages to touch on so many levels. I laughed and even shed a few tears at some at some point. Highly recommended.
" What In the world
",2019-09-23 00:00:00,1,THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR CHILDREN!!! This isn't even for adults. This is just boring and the girl runs away I never want my child seeing this
" Intellectual and intelligent, its perhaps the most adult animated film Pixar has ever released.
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,10,"This animated film is undoubtedly one of the most original and creative I've seen in a long time, and all because of the script, portraying the way emotions (transformed into the characters Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Anger and Fear) influence the actions and behaviors of a young girl who has just moved with her parents to a new city. Intelligent, even intellectual, this film explains in a fun and light way how our emotions, memory and consciousness work, among other complex topics associated with our behavior and psyche, such as nightmares, dreams, traumas, etc.Not much to say about voice actors, and I don't even know most of them. Amy Poehler, who gives voice to Joy, is the one that stands out but everyone did an excellent job. All the characters had their time to shine, but the focus of the film is on the five emotions (with a strong emphasis on Joy and Sadness) and Riley herself. There are truly moving moments throughout the film, which I don't think are intended for children, but rather for a teenage audience and young adults, able to understand what the movie is showing. Before finishing, I just want to leave a word for the well-written dialogues, with some humor in between.From a technical point of view, the movie is flawless, as expected from a Pixar movie. Animated through advanced CGI features, it's the state of the art. Vibrant colors, good brightness, safe and realistic drawings ensure aesthetic and visual beauty, while attention to detail is visible, for example, in the way scenery and everyday objects are carefully designed. As sometimes happens in the movies of this studio, the soundtrack is not the strong dish here.I was truly delighted with this movie because of the way it addresses complex and intellectual topics. But this film is not only that: it is, above all, a good story about how we deal with our dreams, longings and emotions and how they can shape, or even redefine, our character at key moments in our lives."
" Inside Out, More Than Just a Children's Movie
",2019-09-10 00:00:00,10,"It depicted real life in a creative and comprehensive way that made the film entertaining to watch and memorable. Inside Out portrayed a very important life lesson that very few, children or adults, really understand... the movie didn't just achieve Disney's entertainment goals, but fulfilled a deeper role in educating all group ages on emotional growth and the true meaning of life."
" Inside Out
",2019-09-08 00:00:00,10,One of the only movies ever to bring me to real tears on the first viewing.
" A visual and emotional spectacle to behold!
",2019-09-07 00:00:00,10,"Pixar does it once again! This movie marked the start of what I have dubbed the Pixar Emotional Renaissance which feature not only this, but Coco and Toy Story 4. The lighting of everything is amazing, from the soft glow that Joy emits to the heat waves above Anger's head when he gets ""fired up"" Fear is the best character and it's helped by Bill Hader being an amazing actor. You'll laugh and you'll cry. All in all, this is a wonderful movie"
" Great way to teach kids how to express how they are feeling
",2019-09-03 00:00:00,10,What a great way for kids to learn how to express how they feel. I love how relevant and vibrant this movie is and that it teaches an important lesson without being too preachy
" Inside Out is one of those Pixar outputs geared for adults with its deep message about personal growth
",2019-09-03 00:00:00,10,"With an innovative story telling, Inside Out is a unique Pixar output that elevates the genre by witty exploration of human psychology. Although the film is about a kid who goes through the commotions of losing home and living in another place, Inside Out is one of those Pixar outputs geared for adults with its deep message about personal growth. Human emotions are not simple happiness, sadness, fear, disgust or anger but a combination of each.Led by Amy Poehler as Joy, the voice cast perfectly embodies the emotion they represent. Inside Out starts by establishing Riley living in an ideal home. The story takes her from Minnesota to San Francisco, providing an abrupt change of environment. Losing her friends and the place she calls home, Riley's world slowly crumbles as a feeling of loss overcomes her. Despite her best attempts Joy is also overcome by Sadness, played by Phyllis Smith, who unbestknown to them is the emotion Riley needs. As both confront at headquarters an accident occurs that transports them to long term memory, leaving behind Fear, Anger and Disgust, emotions that would only exacerbate Riley.Their journey back to headquarters takes them through Riley's memories, subconscious, abstract thought, dreams and imagination, presenting a landscape of rapid growth for the character. Simultaneously, pillars or islands of Riley's life fall one by one intensifying the emotion's journey.An idea by Anger to walk away and return to Minnesota nearly lost the character in her sorrow, when in the last moment Sadness was able to prevent Riley from leaving San Francisco. Returning home she breaks down as all core memories are relived, turning to sad memories instead of happy memories. The ending is cathartic as a new core memory with characteristics of happiness and sadness rebuilds a pillar or island of Riley's family. Inside Out never failed to explore an aspect of the character, doing so comically but in a mature way. The trippy visuals and melodic score are also excellent, balancing the story with appropriate artistic qualities.Inside Out is easily one of Pixar's finest films and one of the greatest work of animation by default.10/10"
" Heartwarming.
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,10,At the moment this is what the film portrayed to me. I loved it all and the characters all grew into me.The film is a honest portrayal of the teen life and everything in it. I cried happy tears as the movie went on. Worth a watch.
" My Review!
",2019-08-29 00:00:00,9,"Combining the brilliant minds of Disney & Pixar gives results like this one, I wish them all the success in bringing such beautiful movies in time to come. An interesting portray of how a human thinks and acts to surroundings right from birth. This is by far the most realistic approach of human nature via an animated movie. Many might not like the idea of watching an animated movie but if you'll just give it a shot, I bet you'll love it. It's WORTH IT.Peace Out!"
" Lets Review/Salute On This Movie

" BORING! WEIRD! SUPER DUMB!
",2019-08-14 00:00:00,1,"Huh? What did I watch? I was forced to watch this movie at school for a ""reward"" (many high schoolers don't like kids movies, school was torturing us) From the beginning of the movie I was just bored. We have babies and some sappy family moments and some weird explanations that nobody can understand. But then they move from Minnesota to San Francisco. Ok, I'm from Minnesota, MINNESOTA IS SO NICE! WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO LEAVE! (That's probably why they had us watch it) Then the girl starts having a mental breakdown and Happy and Sad are sucked out of a tube.... and it just gets weirder from there..... they end up in a tunnel and have to make their way back to to the tower. So Happy and Sad walk and find this stupid elephant guy who claims to be able to guide them through the maze but just gets them stuck in some wierd chamber where the animation styles start changing. (I'll stick with Spider-Verse for clashing animation) Then there is this boring side plot with the girl and Angry, Disgusting, and Fear. Then there is some more weird stuff in between and then the 11 YEAR OLD girl decides to use a CREDIT CARD to go back to Minnesota! What? How does that work? I dunno but then the end happens and I have no idea what happened because I didn't understand it. I just don't understand what's happened to Pixar, they used to be so good. Oh well, I'm done with Disney movies"

" Underrated Adult Movie
",2019-07-15 00:00:00,10,Let me start by saying that this movie is not for kids. The movie is definitely geared more towards adults and has more of a message than many of the movies that are currently out. This is a definite must watch an incredibly underrated brilliant movie
" Greatly crafted!
",2019-07-09 00:00:00,8,"This is a great story in every sense. The world building was complicated, given the number of details and elements they had to establish. However, the work they did was magnificent. The plot is flawless, with every event logically provoking the next one, and every solution to problems having been set up in earlier scenes. The characters are, all of them, endearing. The empathy is built masterfully, and I found myself highly stressed after the islands began to fall. I was worried for Joy and the other guys, but mostly for Riley. She's not the hero of the story by no means, but having her represent and innocent victim of the struggles of the emotions is great and really made, at least me, more engaged in the story and the stakes. These elements made me struggle not to let a tear out at certain points of the movie, like when Bing Bong sacrifices himself or when Riley reunites with her family. This is a very relatable movie, we were all 11 after all, and is one of Pixar's best."
" Confused
",2019-07-02 00:00:00,3,"1. Out of blue, Riley get sad and upset about her parents, like, for what?
2. Joy is really annoying throughout the film, no need to mention more.
3. Riley's parents really do not care about their daughter.
The epic dinner scene: mom could have asked what happened in school with Riley alone, instead of signaling her husband to take over at the table, considering Riley already looks upset."
" Pixar's and Disney's very best
",2019-07-02 00:00:00,10,"Now this is a Pixar movie! Very different from Pixar's other movies, but an excellent, excellent movie that goes beyond Pixar's usual standard. This film has won quite a few awards, including the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature - for a very good reason.
In this movie, instead of having humans as the main characters, the creators of Inside Out made the emotions the main characters. Almost all of the movie takes place inside the main human character's - a girl called Riley - head, with her emotions as characters.
Meet the emotions: Joy - a bubbly, talkative girl and a control freak. She's kinda' likeable, but is my least favourite character. She is in control of the Console, where they get Riley feeling. She tries to keep Sadness away from the console as she doesn't understand Sadness, nor sees the use of her. But she is quite okay with the other emotions - Disgust, Fear, and Anger - being at the console.
Fear - well, the name speaks for itself, doesn't it? Fear is a very nervous guy. A complete scaredy-cat. He is actually quite funny sometimes. He keeps Riley safe and cautious.
Anger - as Joy put it, this dude ""cares very deeply about things being fair."" Prone to 'blowing his top' (almost literally), he is so hilarious and does care and has a lot of soul. He is my personal favourite of the emotions.
Sadness - she is, well, very sad. Joy tries to keep her away from the console as she doesn't understand what she does and believes that Riley should be happy, not sad. Sadness, the rejected one out of the emotions, reads a lot of the Mind Manuals (that tells them how things work in Riley's mind and such). She is full of knowledge of Riley's mind, and actually quite a nice and likeable character.
Disgust - She basically keeps Riley from being poisoned. She controls the disgust aspect of Riley. Again, another likeable and hilarious character and probably the most sensible character - one who deals in realism. Sometimes.
Riley and her parents move to Minnesota. Things come to a head with Joy and Sadness when Sadness starts to touch Riley's memories, causing them to change to sad. On Riley's first day of school after they move, Sadness gets to the Console, causing the memory of that time - which was a very important memory, called a Core Memory - to be sad, and it's the very first one to be sad. Joy panics, and tries to get rid of that Core Memory, and ends up being sucked out of HeadQuarters with Sadness and all the other Core Memories. Now they have to try and get back to HQ as without the Core Memories, Riley starts to lose her personality and slips into depression.
The other emotions try to pretend to be Joy, but that fails miserably. As the other emotions try to navigate Riley through each day as they await Joy's and Sadness' return, Riley becomes distant and aloof, moody and ends up becoming apathetic. Joy learns some very important lessons, the main one being finally understanding Sadness' purpose. Can they make it back to HQ in time to restore Riley?
For a children's movie, this deals with very serious issues. It is very well-thought out and really gets you thinking. I could really relate to Riley. I consider it to be flawless. Absolutely perfect! A great script, great plot, awesome voices, and the issues dealt with are done in such a way that it is still entertaining for children. It is one of my favourite children movies and is an awesome animated movie. The climax is fantastic - it has a very emotional and desperate feel to it. Then again, the whole movie is one big emotional roller-coaster. The cast did a stellar job bringing the characters to life. The music score went very well with the movie.
A fantastic, and I mean utterly fantastic piece. If you haven't watched it, I would strongly urge you to watch it."
" Before Watching: Inside Out (2015)
",2019-06-23 00:00:00,8,"""Inside Out"" (2015) is a fantastic movie, and if you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Despite what one might think about movies aimed towards children, this movie is quite deep. Maybe not so much as to a complex narrative, but more so towards an emotional side. It will remind you of sides of yourself you might have forgotten about, and if relating and resonating on that emotional and nostalgic level tends to bring out tears in other circumstances, you're in for another trip down that lane. Be sure to watch it with as comfortable of a surrounding as you can get, as that can allow you to embrace that side and make your watching more rewarding.That being said, this is also a kid's movie. Despite a surprisingly mature theme, it also features some humor for the younger audience that can come off as distracting depending of your acceptance of quirky characters and slapstick humor. However, Inside Out doesn't stick that side up your face enough in order for it to develop into a nuisance, unless you really dislike those types of elements (but if you do, do re-consider your choice of movie or genre as a whole).My personal grade: an emotional 8/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews."
" Interesting

I recommend the families to watch like these conservative movies .."
" Simplify psychology

" I cried like a baby..
",2019-06-14 00:00:00,9,"I watched the movie long time ago, and I've just rewatched it today.
For kids it will be a funny movie with no meaning maybe!!
But for an adult, its so true!! You lose your childhood personality you change you feel sad, i mean it literally touches my soul
Great movie for both kids and adults."
" Strong drama about how reality affects us overall
",2019-06-09 00:00:00,8,"Inside Out is a straightforward movie that fantasises over how your mind works overall, specially on personality development and memory creation.I'm not sure if I'd recommend it to a kid. It's not a movie where you'll be laughing your way throughout it; actually, most of it is like a strong drama. Some themes are not even for children.One will be following the adventure of Joy and Sadness as they try to get back to ""Head""quarters, where all mind-related happens. As they proceed, they learn how life works overall and how one should accept reality as it is.It has nice animation and a catchy vibe to it. If you're a fan of this kind of movies, this one is a go for sure."
" All time top 5, easy.
",2019-05-30 00:00:00,10,"Tears in my eyes of laughter and of being moved by Riley's emotional rollercoaster. What a superb coming of age, this story is brilliantly put together. Everything fits so,so good storywise and is displayed in such an imaginative manner that I bow my deepest bow for the artists responsible. In my opinion it should have won best film in 2016 Oscars, hands down. Mandatory watch for all movielovers."

" Worst Pixar movie ever!
",2019-05-21 00:00:00,2,I would usually watch a Pixar movie as most of them are quite funny so I gave this one a go & I have to say never again! It was boring from start to finish even my 4 yr old agreed but still wanted to watch it to the end..what are you doing Pixar??
" Creative
",2019-05-20 00:00:00,10,"This film tells about how we feel when we are angry, sad, happy and other feelings.
the presentation is also very interesting and not boring, for me this film is very creative where it can be thought to make a story about how a feeling is created in a visual form."
" Relatable on many levels.
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,9,"I'm now convinced that if Pixar wanted to jump across the uncanny valley, they could probably do it. Not only does this film improve upon their already impressive visual style, but it does so in a way that brings that inexpiable time in our lives into coherence. Sure, they do stick to the cliches of film (including some they've mastered as well), but a lot of this film wouldn't work if we all hadn't experienced these things at one point or another."
" In your head
",2019-05-14 00:00:00,6,"Pixar makes a cartoon about depression and it is aimed at kids.Riley is a happy 11 year old girl whose parents have moved from Minnesota to San Francisco. Being apart from her friends and her hockey team has upset the balance of her her core memories and five emotions of Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling.) Joy is the main controlling factor in Riley's life.It is Sadness though that threatens to unbalance Riley and in the turmoil the two emotions of Joy and Sadness get moved to her Long Term Memory compartment. This leaves Fear, Disgust, and Anger in charge of her brain, the Headquarter and they do not know how to control Riley now she is in her new school in the big city. Riley gets moody withdrawn and sad. Her parents worry that their sweet little child has gone.Joy and Sadness need to find a way back to the Headquarter before permanent damage is done to Riley and they do this with the of a childhood imaginary friend Bing Bong (Richard Kind.)This is a multi layered story shown in a colourful and frenetic way. Kids would enjoy that side of it. However Inside Out is also a bittersweet film. While I appreciated the cerebral subtext of the film, as a feature length cartoon the story did feel clunky at times."
" Emotional Rollercoaster!
",2019-05-08 00:00:00,10,"I was watching this at a very bad mood.Due to it,i could'nt even enjoy the best moments.But still i found myself crying and laughing at climax.I will rewatch it."
" OK i guess
",2019-05-02 00:00:00,6,"The animation is nice and is an interesting take on how the mind works in an upbeat and humorous way. The plot, however, is decent I guess, quite a bit of hole here and there. Din't make as much as a emotional impact on me, since it's probably more meant for a younger audience."
" Brilliant Film for Adults and Children
",2019-04-30 00:00:00,9,"Pixar did it again. As we follow Riley, an eleven-year-old girl, we learn how exactly her mind works (a big, industrial machine with the control center manned by Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear), her memories and her personality. But one day, following an accident, Joy and Sadness become expelled from the control center. Thus begins the epic journey as the two emotions attempt to return to where they belong, before Riley suffers too much emotional damage.Knowing Pixar, we all expect the gorgeous animation and the top-notch voice acting, and of course this film delivers, but it has something more. Out of all of the animated films Pixar has put out, and there are many great ones, ""Inside Out"" has probably the most carefully constructed script of any of them. The dialogue and story are simultaneously both a colorful adventure and an exploration of the thought processes of a young girl. This is probably the greatest film ever about metacognition, yet it is put in terms a child would understand; I left the theater interpreting my thoughts and emotions through the concepts put forth by the animation. Great movie."
" Pixars comeback
",2019-04-25 00:00:00,10,"After the two underwhelming sequels(cars 2 and monsters university) pete doctor had a very unique idea for a pixar film and the movie turned out to be called Inside out. One side of the movie is about riley moving to san Francisco and how she has to face her new life. While the other side of the story is about how her five main emotions take care of her; Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear. The main lesson of Inside out is that being sad is ok its part of life and being sad can show how you feel to other people but joy the protagonist really doesn't get what sadness really does. When joy and sadness get transported to long term memory by accident they gotta go threw many obstacles that are in the way like the area longterm memory or the subconscious. Bing bong is the one that lead joy and sadness to all those areas so they can find a way back but every time they try they fail because of what the other emotions are doing in headquarters. Theres one stand alone scene and that is the scene where joy and bing bong fall in to the memory dump. In this scene joy saw the importance of sadness and she learned the lesson that being sad is ok. Joy eventually escape but Bing bong doesn't make it out since he sacrificed himself to help riley, and joy is find anyway to make it back with sadness they eventually do and joy depended on sadness to help riley which she succeeds. Inside out is a very special movie that can really help people especially people with depression. Overall its one of the gems of pixar"
" Not bad but not as good as people say
",2019-04-23 00:00:00,6,"I watched this film due to the fact that it is rated very high so I had great expectations.Those expectations were not met.
The film is slow.Very slow. It has some good moments but it is not thrilling.
Joy tries to prevent sadness from creating sad core memories and therefore they are lost in Riley's memory.They try to go back and fix this before she loses her joy and personality. But it is somewhat ridiculous.
This quest is not interesting. I got very bored watching this.And I like animation, it's just that this one fails.
The idea is interesting but it is not well executed. I do not think that this movie was made for kids, it is more of an adult movie. It is not funny at all. It is depressing. It also makes no sense. Why Riley's parents sold their beautiful house and bought this horrendous house in San Francisco? And why didn't they try to clean their house.The house was awful.It is not a place for a kid to live. And all these weird stuff. Imaginary friends,broccoli pizza, scary clowns. The script is plain and absurd.
I feel that lately animation films are totally drained out of interest and plot. It is not as bad as ""wonderpark"" and ""ralph breaks the internet"".Those films were horrendous. But this one is dull and miserable. Joy wants to bring joy but she is more depressed than sadness."
" Misses the mark with me.
",2019-04-21 00:00:00,6,"I did enjoy ""Inside Out"" more today than did I did the last time I watched it. So, it is growing on me. That said, it still misses the mark. It's just too weird to be a truly satisfying experience. A lot of it comes off like a stoner movie. I have a hard time connecting with the characters. Although Sadness gets her share of laughs, she's mostly pretty annoying. I know a lot of people really enjoy this movie. I know that it's heart is in the right place. I'm not ready to give up on this movie. I hope ""Inside Out"" continues to grow on me. We'll see."
" Everyone thinks they are a critic but nobody is unbias
",2019-04-11 00:00:00,9,"I have my own emotional issues that prevent me from crying and this movie really helped me understand that I was not a cry baby when I was a kid. I was normal.We need to teach our children it's okay to cry and that some happy comes with some sad.
Kids need to learn to get up when they fall and try again.
All these points of learning where covered in the movie.My husband is also one of those who didn't like the movie, but if the movie was so oooo bad then why is it not on Netflix or prime or free on any thing like sling.The movie showed how people change. The girl in the movie was in middle school, all parents need to know this is when kids start getting depression. That reality is why there are so many bad reviews. People can't handle the truth.The movie only covered what a week of her life, do you really think it's only a week of depression, you all going off an all the hate for the movie really have a closed mind and know nothing of symbolism.She was sad she missed her friends & her life. She's in a new school watching her old friends move on and having a hard time meeting new ppl cause she's thinking about all the good time's turned sad that she had to miss them now 💔.Everything in this movie is real life!!!"
" Who's mans said this was good?
",2019-04-10 00:00:00,1,I have no clue why people hail this as a comeback of sorts for Pixar. It left me empty and appalled at its simplicity while also creating a sense of dread for what Pixar would do in the future.
" Pixar Animation At Its Finest
",2019-04-02 00:00:00,10,"An interesting and unique story brought to us by one the best animation studios in history. The animation is incredibly beautiful, as usual with Pixar, with stunning and colorful visuals presenting a heartwarming story rounded up with a great cast that brings some of the most memorable Pixar characters to life."
" Not Pixar's Best but Highly Original
",2019-04-01 00:00:00,8,"I watched this for a second time the other day. From a visual perspective, this is one of the least beautiful Pixar creations. Look at the poster. In my opinion there is a an all around lack of taste and style. That said, this is an amazingly out of the box and high concept story which is very well told. Leave it to Pixar to make something this weird and experimental into a thoroughly enjoyable and relatable piece of mass entertainment for all ages. If this was made by an other studio, I might give this a 9 instead of a 8. But my standards for Pixar are crazy high. That is not fair I guess but at least I am being honest about it :)"
" The fact that this movie has so many 1 star reviews is proof that there is no point in making great movies anymore......
",2019-03-31 00:00:00,10,"I hate to see so many 1 star reviews claiming this movie was ""too depressing"". Everyone who said that missed the point completely. Growing up ain't all sunshine and rainbows, it comes with a lot of hardships and that's what this movie is about. Riley's emotions try to help her through the difficulty of moving to a new place that isn't all its cracked up to be, and in the process Joy accidentally sends Riley into a deep depression. Sounds depressing, but what makes this movie great is how realistic her depression feels as Joy and Sadness try to help Riley out of it. I feel like this movie's message is ""Growing up will be tough, but you will get through it and there are people who will always help you through it."" and that is a VERY important message for children.Throughout the movie there are plenty of good jokes, gorgeous animation, and a beautiful score by Michael Giacchino (idk how to spell that....) Again, just my two cents, but I think this a great movie, if very different and a bit more depressing by Pixar standards.REALLY starting to think people are just coming to trash all of Pixar's most recent movies out of jealousy or something. There's no way so many people think this movie is garbage. If the good movies are really getting this many bad reviews, it's no wonder the quality of animated movies is going down. There's just no reason to try anymore......"
" The best movie of the 2010's
",2019-03-24 00:00:00,10,"As the decade rolls to a close I have been thinking about what was the greatest movie of the last 10 years. I remember movies like ""Boyhood"" or ""Whiplash"" or ""Roma"" or ""Social Network"" but in the end I can't stop thinking about INSIDE OUT, the crowning achievement of Pixar (a high bar considering they also made Wall-E). It's a beautiful story in the most simple ways, but tackles ideas that are so complex and intertwined that I'm amazed the filmmakers were able to so perfectly find a balance. It's Pixar's most heartbreaking (Bing-Bong, the climax with Sadness...) and probably their most universally relatable. I remember seeing the trailer and thinking this looked like the next total miss for the company... How wrong I was. This movie is a masterpiece."
" Bing Bong, Bing Bong
",2019-03-15 00:00:00,8,"No matter how old I grow, or how many wrinkles I have on my face, or even if I have a husband or kids already, I will always cry when Bing Bong dies. Always. When he falls off and into the bad, fading memories, his beady eyes blinking. It always gets me. I'm the only one who cries, but I don't care. It gets me. Inside Out brings back so many childhood memories, of our joyful times and our sad times this story says that even sad moments and memories can be okay, because they help us grow stronger. And imagination should never leave us and that we should hold on to as many memories as we can."
" Fun Film
",2019-03-02 00:00:00,9,"This week I watch the animated comedy adventure Inside Out (2015). Although this film suffers some interesting glaring loopholes, it is a wonderful example of externalizing intangibles. The concept of externalizing intangibles is simply a way of saying that certain non-physical elements are given physical manifestations. In this case, 11-year-old Riley's emotions adopt humanistic characterizations. The logline reads ""After young Riley is uprooted from her Midwest life and moved to San Francisco, her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness - conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house, and school."" From a writer's perspective, I have a hard time getting past the idea that if Joy experiences any other emotion than Joy that would indicate that she also has a range of emotions and if so why do we never catch a glimpse of her internal controls? And if that's the case, then is this internal control system an infinite loop? Where does it stop? Once I push these questions to the side, I can appreciate the film for what it was intended to be on a more one-dimensional level. The concept of this film really is a wonderful idea and made for a fun children's story. Being a Pixar film, of course all of the production values are relatively standard for a major studio. I can only imagine how many rounds of edits and reviews were done by multiple artists and directors before the final cut was pushed through. The casting and acting were really well done and I'm not sure we would have had the same film had other actors been chosen for these roles. Overall, I enjoyed the film and would watch it again."
" Fantastic Film
",2019-02-27 00:00:00,8,"""Inside Out"" (2015) is a professionally produced comedic adventure animation about the inner emotions Riley, played by Kaitlyn Dias, after she is forced to move from the only place she's ever known to San Francisco. This film is mostly told completely from her emotions, Joy voiced by Amy Poehler, Sadness voiced by Phyllis Smith, Fear voiced by Bill Hader, Anger voiced by Lewis Black and Disgust voiced by Mindy Kaling, are the perfect embodiment of externalizing intangibles. My son and I really identify with this film due to our military history and moving around every three years. This film gives us both a sense of sadness because of its relatability and hopefulness. This is a great film to show children that are dealing with the hardship of moving from a familiar place.Pete Doctor and Ronnie Del Carmen did a marvelous job capturing the true nature of dealing with a move from the perspective of a child. All the emotions are raging and trying to identify which one takes the front seat is a magical battle on the big screen. I commend the actors and actresses for their portrayal in this film because it is difficult to effectively portray an emotion solely through lines. They did an amazing job bring those additional intangibles to life. Overall this is a great film regardless of some of the critics out there that have deemed it too dark for children. This film, though animation, is a perfect realization of what children go through during an undesired move."
" Perfect movie
",2019-02-25 00:00:00,10,"This might be the smartest kids movie ever. Maybe not the best, nor the more emotional, nor the one with the better message, but the smartest with every single decision being just perfect.
It helps that the voice casting was perfect too.
Some little things: the father was considered dumb by the mother, while she's never seen in any bad light, giving the impression of a perfect woman and a dumb man, for no real reason. Quite insignificant, by the way. Another: it played the stereotypes with the ""emotions"" in the protagonist head, and the fact that sadness was fat may be a little... well, questionable. Maybe it isn't. I don't know.Story, design, colors, creativity, coherence, psychology. Everything just works."
" Pixar's animation is a synonym for quality
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,9,"Pixar's animation is a synonym for quality. In recent years, in addition to the sequel of general mobilization, the rest of the new ideas are eye-catching. Five kinds of emotions and memory balls are used to vividly explain the way of thinking of human beings. The gains and losses in the process of human growth are perfectly explained by the experiences in the process of exploration. People, always from pure childhood, slowly mature, slowly mix color, most will not be able to say whether it is happy or sad. Not only is it valuable for children, but also for adults. It is also of educational significance for parents."
" Everyone that rated this below a 7 are why can't have nice things.
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,10,"Oh my god. This has to be the most misunderstood Pixar film ever created.
I never realized how much hate this movie had gotten until now, but, reading through the reviews, it just isn't justified.
All of these are parents complaining about it being too intense for young children, but, this film isn't for them. I found that it reached out to a completely new audience, one that Pixar hasn't really touched upon recently, and that is pre-teens and teenagers that suffer from depression.
I am now 14 years old, and this film came out at just the right time for me, when things were taking a turn for the worst. I was going through depression and suicidal thoughts for reasons that I don't want to talk about, around the time in which this film was released. I hadn't seen a disney film in quite a long time, and my little sister really wanted to see this one.
Looking at all the generally positive feedback, I decided to go see it with her.
The opening sequence was possibly one of the best Pixar had done since Wall-E. It was beautiful and cinematic, and just adorable. Riley had some pretty gorgeous facial expressions and detailing for an animation standpoint.
As the film moved on, I started to realize how well this film related to my life, and how well riley related to me as a character. Pixar was very subtle with it, but, managed to develop Riley's character so well, with her barely being on screen.
The characters themselves were shockingly complex, especially sadness and joy. (Joy has a brilliant character design, with blue eyes and blue hair which we'll get to later.)
The main plot basically revolves around a pre-teen going into a state of depression after moving to her new home, away from her friends, her hockey team.
Depression, in my experience, isnt what it says it is. To me, it is a complete lack of any feeling whatsoever. When joy and sadness basically lose control of riley for awhile, this perfectly captured the ""what is going on inside their head"" meaning at the beginning of the film. Joy and sadness are the two most important emotions, and riley didnt have them anymore. A complete lack of emotion, a state of depression.
The rest of the film after that was enjoyable, and a certain character whom I was almost sure going to be a twist villain after that monstrosity that was 'Frozen', turned out to be my personal favorite character in the film. Everyone's had some sort of imaginative personality growing up. I had one.
It helped me cope with stress, I talked to it when I was mad about something, and whenever no one seemed to want to talk to me for whatever the reason, she was always there. That's why Bing Bong's death was just so hard to watch, because of how painfully true it is. I guarantee that 99% of the people on earth have completely forgotten about their imaginative friends growing up. The thing is, he didnt die, he was completely forgotten. When you think about it, it seems so much worse than dying. After that, joy seems to have forgotten about him as well. He isnt mentioned ever again in the movie, but, I'm kinda okay with that. If the movie forgets about him, the audience does as well, which creates an illusion.
Now, let's talk about the ending.
When riley returns home to her worried parents, she seems emotionless. Then I realized something, a slow realization that happened throughout the final scene in the film.
True happiness cannot exist without sadness.
This realization is depicted in one of the most brilliant forms ever, mixed emotions. As riley is growing up and maturing, mixed emotions become apart of her and her core memories. This symbolizes maturity and complexity as you grow up.
This film got me to open up to my parents about my depression and anxiety, and I feel like I have matured just like riley did in the film. Pixar did a brilliant job as depicting our emotions, personalities, and maturity. I love this film so much, and it changed my life."
" A real gem
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,10,"Inside Out is one of the most satisfying movies I've watched, and couldn't believe I'd overlooked it. I would say it's up there with the Toy Story series as Pixar's best work. It's one of those films which just takes an ingenious and fun concept and makes it into something immersive to invest the audience. Seeing the world inside Riley's head is a cool concept and manages to lead to some amazing storytelling which is actually very emotional. Watching it got me thinking what the world in my head would look like (what a crazy place)! Pixar are experts in managing to make a fun film be very touching and honest about life. I enjoyed the characters, story, music, laughed and even cried. I highly recommend not overlooking this movie. It's a real gem."
" Such a good, insightful film!!

" Inside out turns your emotions inside out
",2019-02-05 00:00:00,10,"There is a unique concept to this movie that is found in no other movie. The way they tackle the teenage mind and how it functions is incredible, especially while able to add humor in the mix. The angle they approach the discussion of depression is remarkable. The movie will take you on a emotional rollercoaster. Even Mr. Macho might shed some tears. As some people might say it is too heavy for kids, I beg the question how do you know your kid isn't feeling this way currently? As you leave the theatre in tears it forces you to ponder the question what is going on inside thier head, and allows us to reevaluate our out look on life."
" Kids film that aren't only for kids.
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,10,"Inside out is one of my favorite Disney (pixar) movie that doesn't disappointing as usual and so memorable like UP, Coco, Wreck-It Ralph, etc. A incredible film with cool effects, animation and storyline. Salute to Pete Docter, Jonas Rivera and team. So many value that we can get from this film. One of things that i learned from this film is, that all emotions are important in our life and its okay to be sad for something because sadness isn't always bad and joy isn't always good for some reasons. I recommend this film to everyone especially for those of you who often feel anxiety, depressed, tired of life, and pretend to be happy."

" A Fabulous Animated Exploration of Human Emotions
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,9,"23 June 2015. This innovating, educational, appealing, and emotion-laden animated movie dazzles with a spectrum of delightful and meaningful portrayals throughout its 94 minute running time. Not since Wall*e (2008), Robin William's What Dreams May Come (1998), La Planete sauvage (1973), The Incredibles (2004), or Spirited Away (2001) has there been an animated movie that brings out a fresh, vibrant experience involving deep universal emotions between family members. The movies incorporates of a creative, simplified but reliable look at the brain and emotions and how each one of them, especially those that might surprise many audience members are essential for human authenticity and mental health.What's even more impressive is Inside Out avoids reliance on super special effects to compel the audience to awe and wonder, but rather a playful assortment of imaginative visions that oftentimes Japanese animated movies have been famous for and uses a substantive, meaningful, spirited script to keep the audience entranced with its universal themes of the ties that bind joy and sadness. This is well balanced movie that elicits laughter, sadness, anger, and happiness and all the emotions reflected in the movie without crass marketing manipulation."

",2018-12-31 00:00:00,8,"Seeing this so many times, I've realized something. Joy always think Riley has to be happy every day, never wanting her to be sad.Deep down, you need every emotion, including sadness, and joy doesn't realize that till the end.This movie is one of my top ten next to finding Nemo, toy story and even coco. It takes you to realize why Sadness is just as important as Joy in this movie. Enjoy it, and you realize how emotional this movie is"
" I really wanted this to be a masterpiece!
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,8,"Let me start by saying that I've seen many bad reviews for this film and some good ones trying to combat those bad ones. I tried to keep an open mind and not let myself influenced by any of them and make my own opinion. So here it is:First of this movie starts strong and I got me from the first second although I mainly knew what it was about.The concept was very interesting executed although it was way too oversimplified, but hey... it's a kid's movie, would talk about how feelings develop or manifest in science terms? You must make these ideas interesting, captivating and palpable for children and props to the movie for doing that. But after that the movie lost it's tempo for me unfortunately. It got actually unnecessary complicated. It was like this scene here, this scene there could be pulled out of the movie, and the movie wouldn't have suffered for it. I'll enter some spoilers territory here so for those who haven't seen the movie skip this part. ***SPOILERS: When Joy finds herself with sadness along the crest of that cliff and sees that she needs to get back, she realizes that she can't go along the edge of it because there wasn't enough space. But later on when the clock was ticking suddenly there was space between the long-term memories and the edge of the cliff just so that joy could reach the place she wanted to go. That is just lazy writing and some inconsistency. Next, at the beginning of her journey back to the tower joy sees the islands crashing very fast, but later on when the movie is ending and she\s running out of time, the last island (which was family island and a bigger one though) it crashes so slowly that again screams laziness in writing a cohesive story that is constant from start to finish and doesn't contradicts itself on the way. Next when joy tries to reach the train she makes and unnecessary detour with Bing bong that is just there to offer some character development to a character that I didn't need investing in. By the end Bing bong starts to disappear like one hand in 10 or 15 minutes of screen time but at the end when he sacrifices himself to help joy get back on the cliff he instantly disappears in an instant, again inconsistency... END OF SPOILERS***Apart from that the story was beautiful with some very touching moments that almost made me cry and very mature (but not too mature as some people said here) themes for both children and adults alike. The humor... some of the best humor in a animated movie ever put to screen, and that surely elevated this movie in my opinion. The score was again extremely well don by Michael Giacchino, although not one of his best or better ones.All in all a good movie with some great moments in it but at the same time with severe incoherence problems that unfortunately for me didn't work as a masterpiece (like it was praised by critics) like for example ""Coco"" or ""Zootopia"" or ""Wall-E"". 8/10"

",2018-12-06 00:00:00,8,This film was a real treat.It unlocks many perceptions about the human mind. How it grows and overall one of the best animated films ever to be produced in my opinion.Very emotional and beautiful film.
" Pixar's Worst
",2018-11-30 00:00:00,4,"Depressing, bleak, boring. Characters are brainless and repetitively make the same mistakes. Couldn't wait for the movie to end which is something I never say about Pixar movies."
" Brings out deep meanings of life and brilliant animation
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,10,"For those people who think this movie is depressing and sad, yea it kinda is but it also brings out the deep meaning of life - sometimes it's okay to cry out and be sad, you don't have to pretend to be happy and positive and keep everything to yourself. I cried so hard when Riley cried and when Joy finally understands how important Sadness is, Inside Out is one of my favourite movies."
" Painfully mediocre
",2018-11-27 00:00:00,5,"The ""Emotional"" feels this movie is supposed to give out is next to non-existant. I only felt a tiny bit of sadness when Bing Bong, the only likeable character died.The Visuals are amazing and the writing solid, it's still just a really mediocre movie. the concept is amazing, but it's executed in such a way that it's just sad.The plot fells pointless and there is barely no tension, also it's pretty predictable. It's also uses the tell don't show waaay! too much.it's an okay movie, but not even close to the best pixar movie, and especially not the best movie..."
" Go away, miserable people...
",2018-11-27 00:00:00,10,"This is my second favorite Pixar movie, after Monsters Inc. I love the message that life isn't always happy, but sometimes sadness is necessary to bring perspective. Children need to understand that it's okay to be sad, angry, or afraid, and don't have to be happy all the time. People would be much healthier mentally if we ALL understood this!"
" It doesn't have the emotional depth that I've come to expect from Pixar
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,6,"Inside Out is a fun concept, but it doesn't have the emotional depth (yeah, I went there) that I've come to expect from Pixar. I just wasn't as engaged with this movie as I have been with other Pixar ventures. The animation is fabulous, though, and my kids seemed to really enjoy this movie. I liked it, but I probably won't watch it again."
" how depression works
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,10,"Review: I loved this movie because it explains how our brains work and what causes depression from a child friendly and understandable perspective. The direction and screenplay are both incredible. Both the casting and acting are incredible also. No one actor took the show this was truly an ensemble performance by all the actors who played the emotions perfectly. The actors that were chosen for each emotion did it perfectly Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Bill Hader as Fear, Lewis Black as anger and lastly Mindy Kaling as disgust. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars."
" A Pixar movie with feelings
",2018-11-18 00:00:00,8,"In 2015, Pixar had a busy year with two movies. One, Inside Out, was a huge hit and became a cultural milestone. The other, The Good Dinosaur, became the first box office bomb for Pixar ever. Inside Out is a far better movie than Good Dinosaur, and it's easy to see why. It's quite original and has memorable scenes and the like."
" Brilliant, clever and entertaining
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,8,"In this animated film, the mind of an eleven-year old American girl is a universe unto itself. Five characters represent primary emotions occasionally battling for dominance. The world that surrounds them includes a mega-factory like setting that represents long-term memory.To call ""Inside Out"" clever is a great understatement. It shows the same great creativity and imagination that made the ""Toy Story"" movies such a pleasure to watch. While the girl's outer world has difficult challenges, the inner world (as depicted on screen) is even more chaotic while appearing as an adventure.The film succeeds in its unusual use of psychology as the device to drive its plot. It even manages to create genuine sadness when some of the girl's early childhood memories disappear. And speaking of psychology, the story has a gentle jab against what could be called ""the tyranny of positive thinking"".The good humour in this movie adds to its entertainment value while its intelligence shines through as well thanks to a clever story by Pete Docter (the director), Meg LeFauve, and Josh Cooley."
" Loved it!!
",2018-11-10 00:00:00,10,"The thing I liked most about Inside Out was that it made me feel very nostalgic and it made me think about my entire life. Both kids and adults will enjoy this movie.The emotion characters were really good too, I thought it was hilarious whenever Anger went into rage mode and at first I didn't like Sadness but then I realized i'm not supposed to like her...because she's sad. The ending was amazing and it almost made me cry."
" really?
",2018-10-30 00:00:00,10,"You poor saps who give this film a 1/10 wouldn't know a good movie if it bit you in the rear!!! Children should be taught to understand their emotions while growing up and I think this movie does an excellent job of doing just that!! I would give ""Inside Out"" 11 stars if I could! Well done, Pixar!"
" Why
",2018-10-20 00:00:00,10,"I would say don't believe the bad reviews on here. People apparently don't find movies that teaches children something, a good thing."
" Just the best
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,10,The best animation ever. I love this film. Talks about a serious topic in a fun way.
" It was amazing

" Best animated picture ever

" An instant favorite!
",2018-09-26 00:00:00,10,"Well now, I just adore this film! This is one of my favorite animated films. It touches on so many elements and emotions one can relate to, its a modern masterpiece. The story is fantastic. I mean, what an ingenious idea! If I can summarize the film in one word, it would be AWESOME!I loved everything about this film. The animation was great, the characters were original, the script was sensational. I loved the idea of the Islands of Personality, and the Dream Productions. The film makes one remember fragments from one's own life, long forgotten, and rekindle those wonderful memories. It really makes you dig deep into your memories. Interestingly enough, it also shows the importance of being sad sometimes. Loved this!!"
" The Best Pixar Movie.
",2018-09-16 00:00:00,10,"I thought no Pixar movie would beat it's first- Toy Story. It took 2 full decades of film making but they did it- with Inside Out. I saw this 11 months ago when I was at a tech school for a month. It was my first time away from home and I was very emotional. Many movies I saw helped me for a short while, but none of them did that more than this.Our main character, Riley, has 5 emotions in her head: Joy, Anger, Fear, Disgust, and most importantly, Sadness. They all struggle with each other when Riley has to move away to a new home.I am surprised to see 57 current reviews giving this 1 star. Many claim it's boring. Compared to what? Most kid movies are silly-take that Emoji Movie that came out. I did not see it, but it looked pretty dumb and worthless.Some have said that it's too complex. Perhaps I should have mentioned this earlier, but this may be best for older audiences, like The Hunchback of Notre Dame. It's a movie that older audiences can connect with more. This isn't exactly for toddlers, but grade schoolers and up should see this.I cannot think of another Pixar film I would want to give more in-depth praise to. I would love to see more animated features like this. Our society needs it.Inside Out is not just a great animated movie but one of the best movies I have seen in recent years. Even grown ups should see this Disney masterpiece."
" A beacon!
",2018-09-11 00:00:00,10,"Inside Out is a charming, original story. A movie about the emotions of a 12 year old girl must be really hard to pull off, kudos to Pixar. Each and every decision reflects one emotion, one way or another. They said to have had psychologists help the writers with the plot, because they wanted to go the smart and thoughtful route. Everything about Inside Out was great, I adore this film."
" It was a worthy award
",2018-08-30 00:00:00,10,"In Inside out we are introduced to a different idea about growing up, about life experiences, thereby producing a distinct movie. It's an animation which shows us about the routine of one child. It's about the childhood, but not only for kids. Because it reflects on our feelings and changes.
The main one character is Joy. She is the first feeling that Riley had when she was born. Since then, Joy controls the emotions and the memories of Riley. This is the reason of Joy's existence.
After the appearance of Joy, others secondary feelings share the mind of Riley - Anger, Disgust, Fear and Sadness. All they have their roles by decisions or actions of Riley, but by that time Joy always head the situations.
The journey of the story starts when Riley, that is now 11 years old, moves to another city and her comfortable routine, with her friends, habits, liking, are shattered. These changes have impacted her emotions. So, the characters of her feelings enter in conflict too.
Joy try administering the situation, but she needs to learn how to deal with Sadness, her counterpart.
Produced by Pixel and Disney, this movie won the Oscar of the best animation, and it was a worthy award. It's a singular and original story, dealing into humans emotions, displaying unique sensibility never seen before in a animation. It is a wonderful movie."
" A great, creative and animated movie!
",2018-08-27 00:00:00,9,"Inside Out is definitely a great animated, colorful, comedy and adventurist movie. Its main case and the way of the story are totally new and fresh.. but the storytelling was sometime childish and usual too!As an animated movie, it's so emotional and colorful. The animation was so bright, colorful and details-showing.As a comedy movie, the sense of humor was more than fine, a lot of jokes worked with me very well, and some didn't at all!But as an adventure movie -here's the problem-, the trip, or the journey back to Riley, was sometimes childish and somehow usual.The voices were fitting and amazing.The story is close to every child and young man -such as like me-, it was emotional, enjoyable and joyful!Well, Disney Pixar Inside Out is a truly family, fun and colorful animated movie, that it's totally worth watching!"
" Good!
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,7,The film was made well! Although there were some moments make the whole movie slow down a little bit. But overall its a Good movie well-done. There're some touching moments also. I love the way Bing Bong accepted to disappear to bring more memoriable memories for Riley ^ ^

" Great Ideaaa BRAVO
",2018-08-13 00:00:00,9,"Inside out you know nothing about movie when you look at just the name without knowing anything strange but beautiful,it makes you wonder.
I watched this comment the second time I watched after winning the oscar prize for this movie.
the first word to say about the movie is a super idea that people are entering into the brain, memories and their perfect emotions that control them.
Happiness,Anger, Sadness, Fear, Disgust can not live without them, filmin is trying to tell us all together
a wonderful message to everyone, not just children, everyoneeeefrankly I am very satisfied with the inside out BRAVO"
" Very underrated
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,9,"Not as good as other Pixar movies, but it was decent enough since it's very hard to top or at least reach the level of those big titles"
" Beloved
",2018-08-02 00:00:00,9,"It is fun, well made and meaningful. And I don't see why it is too depressing for children. Kids are not stupid you see. Anyway I was happy to see a children's film portraying real feelings, while being funny and up-beat."
" How?
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,10,"Wtf people. I was just reading like several one reviews and how do people get a movie so wrong?! It should be pg-13? It's not for children? Are these people out of there freaking mind? For all of you who feel that it's not for children, take a look again. You severely underestimate of how much emotion a child can handle and you would be suprised. The 1 star reviews are almost laughable about how inaccurate they are. These people should be locked up in a jail for attempting to stop bringing this movie to the world. I absolutely love Inside Out, it was one of my favorite movies of 2015, and I hope you 1 Star people live your lives full of misery."

",2018-07-21 00:00:00,10,Honestly this movie is an 8/10 but I'm leaving a 10/10 to help correct for all of the 1/10 ratings. This is a sweet and satisfying movie with a great message and I recommend it to anyone who has emotions.
" Interesting Concept for a Kids Film
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,7,"Watched Inside Out on the plane after everyone told me I was going to cry. Didn't cry, but I did take something away from it. Had a few chuckles as well. ""Sadness"" gave me a bit on anxiety. Talk about a depressing character, but I guess that was her role!"
" It's not good people
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,2,"Why do people even like this movie. It's boring beyond belief, and it's extremely stupid. Now your probably saying ""this dude doesn't like kids movies"". Well I actually do. I have watched so much and this one is so well loved that I am just disgusted. I give it a 2 and not a 1 because the animation was good and that's it"
" Great Explanation of human feelings
",2018-07-10 00:00:00,5,"From a counselor's perspective, this is a great film that shows to children their different emotions, how to control them and not let them run wild! It is colorful, bright and entertaining. Love this movie."
" One of the best films i've seen

" Fantastic is an understatement
",2018-07-06 00:00:00,10,"This is one of the best films ever created, in my opinion. I have nothing but praise for this film. It pulls on several emotions. The humor is clean and witty. There is a lot of intelligence in the development of the story. Great job."
" great idea - bad screenplay
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,7,"This animation is based on a great idea, but i was disapointed about the screenplay"
" Very good analogy for human consciousness
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,8,"It is interesting how the director puts all the ingredients that take part of human consciousness, memory, decisions making and emotions; clearly, in the easiest way to understand. A way to explore the head and thinking of a little girl, who isn´t very different from all of us (english is not my native language)"
" Well made, but just too depressing
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,6,"I like this movie, but, I just can't watch it anymore. The more I watch it, the more I realize that it's just too incredibly sad and depressing, and the music on top of that makes me want to die. It's too awful. The whole combination of it all just makes for a garbage film. At least Frozen was fun."
" Ok it's not Pixar's best, but still a good movie
",2018-06-17 00:00:00,10,"Inside Out is one of my personal favorite movies. Reasons why?1. It's funny 
2. Great animation
3. The plot is understandable 
4. Great actorsSure, movies like Toy Story 1 and 3, Coco, and Finding Nemo were better, but this is still an absolute must-watch you should see.10/10"
" I don't understand the other reviews...
",2018-06-10 00:00:00,10,"Hi..., my name is Joy and I'm in the rightful way to answer all of your questions.
Frankly, I don't see the problem with our movie. Even so, it's a family one, but made up for the enjoy of the grown-ups. Maybe you hate it because all of the shouting of Fury, but he can't help it...Inside Out IT'S NOT the biggest Pixar mistakes, (have you seen the ones that Cars made?) but honestly, it's a movie for reflection and understanding our minds. You have to admit it, trying to explain what's is happening inside your heads isn't an easy task. Totally the opposite. Riley is just a girl that it's trying to live her continuos changes that are occurring in her life. Familie, school, friends, even the first tastes of partnership love; that's something difficult to put on in the big screen. I don't blame you, maybe you are happy with the movies that have a hero and a villain. That's how Hollywood has been making all of these years. Maybe you feel comfortable with the idea of seeing the end of the plot since the beginning of the movie. With my friends, well, we tried to perform how did Riley's mind work. Of course it's not the brain of an important guy, or a big president, whatever. But, our animators, creatives, and designers work too freaking hard for trying to imagine how does a simple girl brain do work. You even saw an ally die in this animated movie, come on!, didn't you cry with the tragic death of Riley's imaginary friend?, dudes you really have stone hearts.I must admit that there are little troubles with the making of the rules of some parts of Riley's brain. But you have to take in mind that human brain is an unexplored field nowadays. But well, I f you don't enjoy our movie, don't be too hard with us. However, you have at least to clap and be amazed with the special effects that we have. The music, the incredible designs of our characters, come on!, they are great!From more than 50 different emotions, only have to choose 5?!, that's another problem. What you don't have in mind also, is that the movie would at least last 4 or 3 hours with all of those other emotions. In fact, it could be a total cinematographic mess that our directors wouldn't had approved. Sorry guys, but I repeat, understanding human mind is something too hard in this years.Joy, out!"
" I don't know exactly why
",2018-05-26 00:00:00,10,"This isn't the most epic of Pixar titles. Neither is it the most beautifully animated. The storyline is flawed and some times hard to follow. Logic, there is non - though I believe this was the author's intention to highlight the quirks of the mind. Yet it is one of the few movies that really move me. For some reason I cry every time I see it. I share the protagonist's experience of moving to a whole new place, changing schools and losing friends. But other movies that tell this story don't move me this way. Some how the author reaches into my deepest nostalgic emotions and pull them out. As soon as I pause the film I stop crying and wonder what the hell I'm doing, only to start again as soon as I return to watch again. I really can't explain what this movie does so well, but it's touched this heart of stone. And even made me write a review about it. Truly one of those movies where the sums are greater than the parts. I don't think its particularly entertaining, beautiful or mesmerising for children. But way above other animated films, it nails the depth that make all Pixar's films so appealing to adults. (Except Cars. That's a terrible franchise.)"
" Great movie! Loved it!
",2018-05-23 00:00:00,9,"Honestly I loved the movie and my kids loved it as well. I think most of the people who wrote the negative reviews didn't understand the premise or concept. She wasn't depressed, she was sad about moving. There is a definite difference between the two. Her reaction to moving was a very real one. She didn't want to make her parents feel bad about moving so she hid her emotions. That's a very real concept and whether we realize it or not our kids care and worry like we do. And will sometimes not share their feelings for fear of hurting ours. Great movie. Watch it with an open mind."
" Good for Children
",2018-05-22 00:00:00,7,"From animals having feelings, to technology having feelings, to even toys having feelings, Inside Out continues the trend with feelings having feelings. Its release in 2015 was more than anticipating with its general audience being young children.
 The movie started off with the birth of the main character, Riley. With that, it included how when each person is born, so are their emotions. Fear, Disgust, Anger, Sadness, and Joy, who was the first to appear. As Riley grew up, each of her emotions appeared as well of the making of each of her core memories. Everything begins to switch up and get off track when Riley and her parents move from Minnesota to San Francisco. From there Riley begins to experience different feelings such as low self esteem and low confidence.
 The story was setting off to the viewers what goes on in young children's minds. A move for example, as used in the movie, can effect a child greatly, mentally."
" I seriously hate this movie soooooo much...
",2018-05-20 00:00:00,1,"You ever watch a movie trailer and you can just tell you're going to hate it? That was this film. When it came out, I knew that I should stay away. Then a few months ago, as part of a project, my teacher had the class and I watch this film because we were learning about perspective-taking or something like that. Within the first five minutes, I knew that it wasn't going to get any better. The first 10 minutes are 85% crying and just people being annoying. That brings me to the first major flaw with this movie: the characters. I hate Riley SO MUCH! She gets sad all the time, but for no good reason...ever. In fact, the first 10-15 minutes of this film are just her crying and being a baby over little things. I wanted to kill myself the longer this went on. I get that we all get sad sometimes, but she gets more upset than any other human being I know, and it happens so spontaneously you have no reason to feel for her. Frankly, I don't know which character I hate more; it's either her or Sadness, who, let me tell you, every second she was onscreen, I wanted to punch her in the face. She spends the entire movie whining and being all angst-ridden and complaining. I get that that's her persona, but it's not done right. Jimmy Neutron did a sad character way better, and they made it funny! This movie's Sadness isn't funny in the slightest. And when everything is said and done, you realize that everything that happens in this movie is basically her fault because tinkers with what she shouldn't. To make matters worse, she never listens to Joy when she tells her DON'T TOUCH THOSE HAPPY MEMORIES. How stupid is this emotion? If I had to make a ""worst characters of all time"" list, she'd be on there with Riley.Oh, and the jokes. Not once did I laugh during this atrocity. I never laughed or even chuckled. The jokes were altogether predictable, boring, and kindergarten-level. Why is it that the non-funny movies are considered to the be the funniest, and the movies that actually ARE funny are the ones left in the dust? This movie's jokes were so bad, they are on par with The Emoji Movie's jokes. Yes. I said that. I actually compared Inside Out to the Emoji Movie. I'd much rather watch that than this. Never has a movie made me want to kill myself, and thankfully I haven't yet, because, it is just a movie. But I still really hate it. This is part of my Top 3 worst movies I've ever seen in my life; it's worse than Ghost Rider 2, worse than Sharknado 3, worst than Toy Story 3, worse than the Clash of the Titans remake and worse than Kubo and the Two Strings.So if you have a very small patience-span, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. It's way too obnoxious and unfunny."
" I loved the idea of those marble memories
",2018-05-19 00:00:00,7,"Pretty great Pixar movie, good for kids of course, especially the middle part with Joy trying to get the core memories back to headquarters, but pretty great for adults too. The story follows Riley, a young girl uprooted from her peaceful life in the Midwest and forced to move to San Francisco when her father starts a new job. We enter Riley's mind as she struggles to adjust to her new city, school and home life. Chaos ensues at ""headquarters"" where new emotions have set up shop. Joy tries to keep things positive but anger, sadness and fear have made an appearance and core memories are being destroyed.I loved the idea of those little marble memories and have thinking about that for days now, it just makes so much sense. As an adult I found this movie thought provoking and sad (imaginary friend Bing-Bong is a bit heartbreaking), as you realize the losing of innocence we all face.Its Pixar so of course kids will love this but this one in particular is pretty great for adults too"
" Whizz-Bang
",2018-05-08 00:00:00,5,I feel mean being negative about this movie but I am not the target audience and only got half way through it. You can see the incredible imagination and skill everyone has put into getting this together but unfortunately I wished it hadn't been so garish and whizz-bang.
" Heartbreaking and beautiful
",2018-05-01 00:00:00,10,Inside Out is the best animated movie I've ever seen. It's deeply emotional and inspiring and is one of my favorite movies ever. Bing Bong's death scene was soul-crushingly sad.
" WORST DAY EVER
",2018-04-30 00:00:00,7,"This is a kid's version of ""Herman's Head."" The target audience appears to be all those 9-11 year old MENSA kids out there.The film looks at 5 emotions in Riley's head from birth through a trying time at age 11. They discuss various aspects of the inner workings of the mind, many of which will go over the head of the target audience. I felt the film concentrated too much on silly nonsense going on within the brain at the expense of Riley's life.I loved Anger, voiced by Lewis Black the angry comic. It was very fitting. However, they missed opportunities for other voices. Isn't Taylor Swift the voice of teen angst? They could have turned this into a classic with the right voices."
" Psychoanalysis made accessible to kids
",2018-04-23 00:00:00,8,"Okay, I could talk about this movie all day - but for brevity's sake I'll try to use this review to address just two key observations. To begin with, this is the first IMDB review that I've felt compelled to write - and compelled is the appropriate word - as the many poorly formulated critiques of this offering demand a robust rebuttal.Firstly, in answer to those individuals who feel that this wonderfully imaginative romp was in any way simplistic - sadly they have neither the intellectual sophistication to appreciate the insights it offers to adults nor the bountiful enthusiasm to recognise the wonder it serves up for wee ones. To suggest that this is some sort of half-baked telling in which a bit of a cry rights the world's ills is, in and of itself, an extraordinarily over-simplistic analysis of the narrative. On the contrary - the whole point of the story is that Riley (by means of her personified emotions) must journey inside herself, consult her dreams and explore the recesses of her subconscious mind in order to learn to embrace her negative emotions - so that she may become a more integrated and well-rounded individual capable of dealing with life's many challenges. This is the crux of psychoanalytic thought - one of the most important and valuable contributions thinkers have made to our collective understanding of the human condition - and this film artfully communicates it in language that children can understand.Secondly, the notion that this is too sad or depressing for children is actually quite infantile. Kids are not idiots or one-dimensional beings that need to be shielded from the harsh realities of life. In fact, anyone who has a rudimentary understanding of child psychology would know that attempting to achieve this generally results in significant damage to their mental health. There's more than enough accessible comedy contained within this animated masterpiece to keep the tone light and fun - but for the record, the film's that spoke to me most powerfully as a child (namely the animated version of The Lord of the Rings, Watership Down, The Never-ending Story and Return of the Jedi) all contained darkness aplenty.I'm genuinely concerned for the futures of the children of parents who were unsettled by the tone of this marvellous effort. Please watch it - the somewhat grumbly tone of this review might detract from the glittering gems it has to offer - but trust me, it's hilarious, delightful and ultimately extremely uplifting."
" A cartoon with a deep sense.
",2018-04-23 00:00:00,8,"The cartoon, in fact, is suitable for any audience, and most importantly - for home viewing. Children can quietly watch and enjoy the picture without getting stuck on anything. Adults, in turn, draw for themselves something interesting."
" Riley Didn't Learn Anything. When Feelz > Realz
",2018-04-21 00:00:00,6,"On some level, Inside Out does a somewhat admirable job at trying to explain to children (and I guess, easily impressed adult children) how emotions work... sort of. It tries to explain that our emotions control our mental faculties, that we think BECAUSE of our emotions. This line of thinking is far too naive. What old Pixar was really good at doing, is telling a story that had both a simplicity that made children understand and a maturity which reflects the reality of the world. It was exceedingly clever and charming and it taught children on how the real world works. Inside Out however, is too fictitious to be taken seriously, and not fictitious enough to be taken lightly. First off, to think that our thoughts and minds and behaviors are controlled by emotions is just patently wrong. Feelings are not reality. Humans are not a manifestation of feelings, the environment is not built upon emotions. Emotions are a symptom of how our minds process our environment. We are happy when something good happens to us, we get angry when we are transgressed, we are sad when we lost something of value to us, we are disgusted by things that would harm us, we are afraid of things that we don't understand. Emotions are reactions, not actions. So right off the bat, the premise of the film is already off. Things are not made any better with the plot. The film centers around Joy, (an emotion of 12 year old girl Riley) having forced to confront a life-altering change and going through a coming of age journey, learning things about Riley, about Joy itself and of other emotions Anger, Disgust, Fear and specifically SadnessThis journey is something that Riley should go through herself, by learning to deal with overwhelming emotions, rather than represented by proxy through Joy. Instead, the movie shows Riley simply ""feel"" things that are happening to her, rather than understand what's going on and take responsibility and accountability for her own wellbeing - which is the essence of growing up. By the end of the show, Riley herself didn't learn anything, she didn't have any growth. Despite this obvious and blatant flaw in the plot, everything else is acceptable. It shows that every emotion is critical in the development of a child, including hardships and sadness. It shows how experiences, and how we recollect them, shapes who we are. Riley's reactions towards the internal turmoil that she is experiencing is very convincing. Amy Poehler performance as joy is right on the mark, while the rest of the cast and crew does an admirable job as well. I wish the story was better, Pixar used to be better. Despite all my ranting, it's still an enjoyable movie."

" Another Pixar classic
",2018-04-08 00:00:00,10,"This is the kind of Pixar movie that we are used to and that we love 
Pixar makes again another innovating and different story that has nothing to envy to the other Pixar's masterpieces such as Up, toy story, Ratatouille, the incredibles, etc 
This is the living prove that Pixar should stop producing sequels that are not bad movies but they are not even close to the Pixar standards.
This movie show us an innovating and beautiful story that I'm sure that it's not like anything You have seen before, Pixar really knows how to make different animated movies and not the typical ones, an absolute triumph for Pixar"
" great jobs

" I cried?!
",2018-04-04 00:00:00,8,Omg I cried at this film. I never thought I would but the story behind it is truly magical and inspiring.
" Could've been better.
",2018-03-27 00:00:00,6,"Plot - This movie is very predictable. This concept has been done before, and the overall story is very formulaic. Yes, its great for a kids' movie, but as a movie it isn't as great as it could've been. There are a lot of very dumb and contradictory plot devices that could've been handled better *cough* train of thought *cough*. Animation - The animation is fantastic. I love all the detail and the way these different things are brought to life onscreen. There are a few things that probably could've been changed (for some reason the memories in the memory balls aren't from Riley's POV) but nothing that really ruins the movie. Characters - I know that its the point that all the characters are as simplistic as possible, but it does make the movie a bit boring at times.South Park - I don't know why, but this movie rips off Imaginaionland from South Park. They even call it that. Of course, the South Park version is much more entertaining and creative, but its clear that its a similar idea. Of all the things that this childrens' movie could rip off, that was unexpected. Overall this is a kinda average kids movie with amazing animation. There are a lot of creative plot devices that aren't handled anywhere near as well as they could've been. This movie gets points for effort and an air of creativity. Overall, I enjoyed this movie. Its a bit funny and a bit sad (I guess). If you are young, have kids, or are easily entertained then I'd recommend this. If you are easily annoyed by predictable nonsense, then I'd recommend skipping this one."
" Funny, really Sweet, and Heartwarming
",2018-03-27 00:00:00,10,"I love this film so much, because it's funny, because of Lewis Black's voice acting for Anger, really Sweet, because of Bing Bong, and Heartwarming, because of that touching scene near the end of the film, where Riley and her parents hug. I definitely recommend watching this film, and Kaitlyn Dias did an amazing job as Riley. All I can say is: ""It's a really great film!"". Kudos to you, Pixar, on an amazing film."
" A Totally Brilliant and Highly Original Film
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,8,"Everything about this original gem from Disney/Pixar had me absorbed from the very start. It gives a graphic, amusing, serious and interesting account of an 11 year old girl uprooted from an idyllic life to the harsh realities of the inner city, and how five of her key emotions help her to adapt - even when things go wrong. From a psychological viewpoint, the film researched the subject with input from professionals in their fields, and this is demonstrated throughout the story. The only thing missing was a soundtrack. Disney could have included the brilliance of good music / songs, which would have made a Inside Out an Oscar winner on every front."
" Great film with an important theme
",2018-03-24 00:00:00,8,"Just finished (inside out) and I loved it.
I then opened imdb and saw a massive wave of bad reviews made by people who clearly doesn't understand the first thing about movies.
This movie has an extremely important theme.. It delves into our deepest emotions. And the way we look at the world growing up. We deal with loneliness, frustration, anger, jealousy, and it's the transition from child to adult.. it's not easy to leave behind the things we loved as kids and now we need to all of the sudden be grown up and deal with constant change around us..We are very vulnerable in this period.. 
and I feel like this movie beautifully illustrates some of the frustrations inside our minds.. of curse it's made with beautiful animation and it's just a take on how It could look inside our minds. Made to a child's enjoyment. And for myself as well. I'm 21 years old and I LOVED this movie.. it spoke to my inner child. And I got really moved by this film.. I even shed a tear towards the end..
Definitely one of the best Pixar movies for sure! Two big thumbs up! Keep em coming Pixar!"
" The Best Pixar Film.
",2018-03-20 00:00:00,10,This film completely blew me away. This film is perfect from the first fame till the last. One of the best movies I've ever seen. This film hit me on a level that I didn't expect it to. I really am in awe of how flawless I thought this film was. I praise Disney/Pixar for creating another masterpiece. This film is a perfect example of why I love movies as much as I do. A+ 10/10
" Movie Review of Inside Out! True Insight into a Child's Mind
",2018-03-19 00:00:00,8,"03/19/2018Movie Review of ""Inside Out""Fear, Sadness, Disgust, Joy and Anger! All emotions we all deal with everyday. The theme of this film was to truly depict what goes on in a child's mind from a toddler to a teenager. Each emotion held their own unique personalities and explained in way children could understand. Starting with the vibrant colors of each emotion. It was clear to distinguish who is who and who's at the operation panel to pan out a day in the mind of Riley. The vibrant colors and tone in the characters voices throughout the film also made it easy to depict what was really going on.Riley's family is forced to move, and Riley has a difficult time adjusting. I love the dinner table scene where Riley is upset and has an attitude when Joy and Sadness are stuck at the other islands tying to get back to HQ. all of this while the ""fun"" islands are slowing fading away. In this scene it depicts a real-life scene where a mother and father want to understand what's going on with their daughter and Riley just wasn't having it. Each emotion from Mom, Dad and Riley were at play here and although it was meant as a serious scene it was depicted comically. The writers wanted to show something the audience can relate to and that is captured here for sure!This film was unique, and I believe that's what was so loved about it. It was a ""real"" kids movie that both adults and children could relate to."
" Surprised by the 1 star reviews
",2018-03-04 00:00:00,8,"I've read a lot of angry reviews that trash the movie, and I frankly don't understand the vitriol. This is no 1-star movie and even if it is not the most amazing thing Pixar has ever produced, I found it very entertaining. As with all Pixar productions, the visuals are lush, fun, and detailed, and the voice acting is great. Lewis Black as Anger was a genius casting move and his character quickly became my favorite.Perhaps part of the reason there are negative reviews is because people are not considering the target audience - which is kids, not adults. Giving emotions relatable, uncomplicated characters is not a sin. There is a subtle subplot going on in this movie where the emotions are learning to live and work with each other - in a sense, growing up just like the main character. Joy isn't able to relate to Sadness, for example. But can they learn to get along and benefit from each others' talent? Watch and find out. Other plot bits deal with how memory, thinking, and imagination work in a context that's accessible even to my (now) 7 year old. She and I even used the emotion characters to help express her inner feelings that she might not always have words for. Don't be put off by the negative reviews. If you like Pixar's work, you'll like this too. You might even love it, but I can't see wanting the time you spent watching it back as some people seem to feel. I've watched it three times with my kids on family movie nights, and I'm still touched by it every time."
" A Beautiful Movie
",2018-03-04 00:00:00,9,"I found this movie beautiful and shows human emotions in ways that i found interesting and entertaining. It is a movie that has heart, skilled writing, and feelings that stay long after the credits roll. If you are looking for a movie that will truly make you feel then I suggest this movie."
" One of the most intelligent movies that breaks down human emotions for kid to understand
",2018-02-26 00:00:00,10,"This might come as a shock for a lot of people who doesn't get how deep and profound this movie is, but this is one of the movies having the highest amount of emotional intelligence put into it. The complex world of human emotions and how it connects with our mind, persona, sub-conscious, long-term memory etc. has been, painstakingly but very beautifully, expressed in simple representation for kids to understand. this builds the most profound notion that even adults fail to understand - sadness is important part of life, to be expressed, and not to be ignored as society teaches you to bury it deep down and to always keep a disingenuous happy face. This movie is way ahead of its time, and I will call it nothing short of a MASTERPIECE. If you haven't watched this like 2 times minimum, you are missing out on something eye-opening and profound."
" fall in love story

but when i saw it the things took another turn
i love it so much

about our life from the begin to the end
it is make us think how we feel and why we feel and how our feeling evolved over time"
" A Creative Piece Of Work
",2018-02-12 00:00:00,10,"If you love animation and Pixar, then you should watch this film. This was one of the most creative pieces of work Pixar has ever done! The characters are lovable and memorable, the story is very well-thought, and the lesson is touching. I'm going to say it again but if you love creativity and animation you should definitely check out this film."
" You need to look deeper into this film y'all
",2018-02-05 00:00:00,10,"Many people keep calling out this film for being very depressing, poorly-developed, or whatever other reason that I don't think I can understand. But the problem is, you don't look deeper into it. Do you really expect your children to understand depression, or expect life to be all peachy and happy and beautiful and sunshiny?
Newsflash, you're ignorant. This is not reality.
As a person with depression, this film hit me hard. There's always a part of you that wants to deny the emotions that come with growing up, you want to remain happy, or neutral at the very least, for the people you love who are surrounded by stress. But in truth, when you try to avoid them, it only makes it worse. This film taught me to embrace my emotions, and be open with it to the people I trust. I was in tears as I watched this film, because while the situation was not the same as what I was going through, the emotions Riley felt and what I felt were very similar. It was what I needed to help me heal from the emotional pain that I was going through at the time. It isn't easy to teach your children that they cannot avoid pain or depression forever, so I say Inside Out is a good start to teaching them that. 
Inside Out, to me, is the best Disney movie. Emotions are a complicated topic reduced to a very simple concept in this movie. It's colorful, funny, and imaginative, all surrounding a complicated yet beautiful tale of how your feelings are normal and shouldn't be pushed away, but rather, you should be honest about them in order to heal. thank you, and goodnight. -drops mic-"
" Couldn't bear anymore..
",2018-01-06 00:00:00,1,"I love animated movies. try to watch any whenever get the chance. But this one was far different from orher ones. Cause I couldn't go even half the way. So so so boaring, never tried again."
" Best cartoon movie in my heart
",2018-01-05 00:00:00,9,"I watched this movie when I am not in a good mood period and I cried a lot during watching. I was surprised by the whole idea of the movie because it shows a different world explaining how we act daily in a reasonable way. Furthermore, I was touched by the fact that things truly get destroyed but don't worry, we can still get better things after that cruel experience.
I was afraid of destruction but this movie gives me huge courage to face the future!"
" If you were looking for the cringiest, most awkward people on the planet...
",2018-01-05 00:00:00,10,"Look no further than this movie's review section. How anyone can go below 8/10 on a timeless classic like this is beyond me. I don't know what else to say. I imagine the people or (or lowlife with too much time and too many fake accounts) that try to shoot down this film, they probably have been seriously triggered in some way, on a deep emotional level. Do you think you should be happy 24/7? Do you think sadness has no value? Do you not believe in scientific concepts (the brain, emotion, memory, neuroscience) which are in abundance in the film? The type of person to hammer this film, I would not want my kids to be within 2 miles of that person, much less do I think that person should be trusted to have kids of their own. 
Please go fix yourself, and stop spewing your diarrhea into IMDB on movies that are quite obviously masterpieces in film."
" Boring, shallow and overrated
",2018-01-01 00:00:00,2,"First time I write a review, but this ""movie"" has made me to. Only gave 2 for the animation, otherwise, it would have been 1 when considering the enjoy factor it provided. The story is way too boring, the ""mind"" characters are devastatingly annoying. Not funny enough for a children movie. The message it tries to communicate is overly artificial, contrived and shallow. I terribly regret wasting the time watching it, waiting for it to become better. It was a real pain watching it, in the end. Cannot understand how it has a rating over 8."
" Pixar still has it
",2017-12-26 00:00:00,9,"I thought Pixar had lost their fastball after their last couple efforts. Never mind. This movie once again made me both laugh and cry. Also, it did that with the most unique and original story I had seen in a long time. Inventive and amazing stuff."
" An animation for all ages
",2017-12-17 00:00:00,9,"Pretty well made animation meant for all ages in which illustrate how mind work as whole. The emotions have been clearly displayed within in this animation as well as their play on one's characteristics, personality and decision making.I beautiful journey in one's mind taking you along on joy, sadness, discuss as well as risk experience within the mind. The analogies used within this animation are priceless and can give pretty good insight to understand our mind as well as people's mind around us.This animation could have pretty constructive effect on children how to acknowledge their feeling and grow up with better understanding."
" I adore Inside Out!
",2017-12-13 00:00:00,10,"Inside Out, is fantastic! In fact, the general reviewer consensus is that this movie is one of the cleverest and most original films that Pixar, or anyone else has ever made. And yes, I know because one of the most frequent words to praise this film is original, the entire internet is now putting in all their efforts to prove to everyone else that it's not.Now I know that this is not the first movie, or animation to illustrate personifications of emotions, or internal thought processes; And even as far as Pixar goes, this is hardly the first movie about about two conflicting characters going on a journey in an otherworldly atmosphere. But this is the first time it's been done in a full length family animation with these particular emotions, executed with this level of clever metaphor for the progressing emotional development of a child, so yes, it's still pretty original. Besides, concept is one factor, and execution is another, and in Pixar fashion, it is fine-tuned to a tee to be easily comprehensible, frequently funny, emotionally relatable, with fun and memorable characters.Inside Out is about the interactions of emotions, inside of a person's head personified as characters. The person in this case, is an 11-year-old girl named Riley; an incredibly happy and well-adjusted child, until her life is completely uprooted, when her family moves to San Francisco. And the movie covers the literally emotional journey that follows. Most of the story takes place inside her mind, and the world the filmakers created to represent the various cerebral functions, is one of the most interesting, engaging aspects of a family movie, that I've seen in a while.Not just in the very likable characters displaying the arguably core emotions, but also how it conveys functions, like long-term memory, personality, dreams, abstract thought, forgetting, subconsciousness, etc. Most of the movie I imagine, you'll be marveling at the incredibly intriguing metaphorical portrayals of these concepts, and also probably thinking about all the extraneous details the film didn't have time to address, like; shouldn't there be some sort of connection between the subconscious, and dream production?But if there's a single element that showcases the film's brilliant design, with near perfect entertaining execution, it's the emotional characters themselves. You think the characters meant to embody a single emotion would be one-note, but the movie makes it clear that their purpose is not just merely spontaneously reacting to things; The emotions all have motivations to serve a particular need, like fear assesses danger, disgust is her sense of literal and social tastes, and anger protects her from being treated unfairly. They all have very appropriate, and entertaining personalities. But the true protagonists of the story are joy, and sadness, who are the ones to embark on the journey, to help Riley get through her emotional crisis, after well, causing it. Pixar has this, frankly brilliant habit of telling stories from the point of view of characters meant to represent parents. And joy is right in this wheelhouse, in her caring and her good intentions, but also for her intrusive, perkiness. Along with Amy Polher's performance, the tireless animation, and the writing, Joy was able to work as an intriguingly flawed protagonist, as well as likable, and entertaining. And it's really that ability to make those sorts of characters, under those sorts to conditions likable that really is Pixar's superpower.Bing Bong was helpful, caring, funny and lovable. Like joy, his success is attributed to the film's execution; culminating with the film's ultimate philosophy about the conflicting relationship between joy and sadness. And by that, I mean the literal relationship between the happy and sad emotions, because the characters, never really connect that much. But then the film's final conclusion is so mutually devastating, uplifting, and accurate, this film would probably become mandatory watching for preteens, even if everything else about it had failed. Overall, this movie was PERFECT."
" Awesome!
",2017-12-10 00:00:00,9,"My favorite Walt Disney movie of all time is this. The special effects are brilliant, and acting is very good, the plot is really easy to follow. The movie does it so well and so smart. The only word I can describe it is genius, this is a genius movie. I love this energy that all the emotions had in this movie and the movie has a great lesson behind it. I feel like adults are gonna like this movie more than kids because adults are can love how this movie explain emotional states. If you have emotions and you have felt emotions you're definitely watch this movie!!!"
" GD17D015 D. Turbold BS100
",2017-12-10 00:00:00,10,"Inside Out is an outstandingly original, heartfelt story from Pixar about growing up and learning to handle your biggest emotions. Told primarily from the perspective of the feelings inside 11-year-old Riley's mind the plot has many moments including bridges/islands crumbling, a train tumbling over a precipice, and characters falling into a deep, dark pit. Some of Riley's fears are also on display, including a giant, scary clown. Parents are likely to get hit hardest by the film's heart-tugging moments, but anyone with empathy will feel for Riley as she experiences life's ups and downs. Ultimately, Inside Out has important messages about needing to feel and express all of your emotions, whether happy or sad. Although most of the content is appropriate for elementary schoolers and up, younger kids may need a bit more explanation about what's going on, since there are references to abstract thought and the subconscious, and it can be a little confusing when other characters emotions are shown."
" BS-100 IJ17D021 KH.KHulan Inside Out review
",2017-12-09 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed the movie. I couldn't imagine how they would make a whole movie from the point of view of the human emotions, but it came out well. And it was really funny movie,with a lot of laughter throughout the movie. I felt lot of emotional from the movie. And I understood lot of important things. This animation has an important message. It brings up family love, respect and never give up... One important truth that I noticed was that you can't have joy without sadness as well, so sadness was a main character for this reason. I found this to be an extremely creative and thought provoking film. The overall theme of family was important. At the begin of animation about grateful family. Father and mother both kind and loving to each other and the daughter. Suddenly, mind of daughter changes. Because her mind makes a trouble from inside out. Finally, Her mind understood most important thing of human life rules. The role of sadness as a vital emotion was really interesting. I liked that. I recommend it. It was very funny, sweet and a great overall family film."

The filmmakers HAVE to dumb it down because it's for kids! As long as the kids like it, that's all that matters! Are we really going to expect complexity from Pixar?The best part about Pixar, is taking SIMPLE concepts, and making them into masterpieces. And besides, there are many more kids movies that deserve more hate than they get! I thought this movie was a MASTERPIECE like a lot of other Pixar movies.Besides even if you do hate this movie, even Disney has made some terrible movies in the past, like Chicken Little, Home on the Range, and Mulan 2!If you are expecting character development, and fleshed out characters, take your stupid hate reviews somewhere else, because this movie is perfect!Remember this: It's just a kids movie! It wasn't made for you, it was made for kids! Maybe it's garbage for you, but a lot of kids love this movie, because this movie was made for THEM."
" pixar does it again
",2017-11-29 00:00:00,10,i can't believe the run of great films that pixar has to its credit. i can't think of a single misfire in the bunch and inside out is one of the very best. they took a seemingly silly concept -- our emotions personified -- and made it into a brilliant and emotionally resonant piece of art. i can't believe how good this film is.
" Mandatory watch for children and parents alike.
",2017-11-23 00:00:00,10,"I did exactly what I was supposed to when watching this brilliant movie, I felt all the emotions at some point. Pixar did it again with Inside Out. For a long time I had stubbornly repeated that Toy Story would always be my favourite from Pixar, but I changed my mind shortly after watching this one. Like Toy Story you were offered a setup every adult can identify. Growing up learning how to control your feelings and learning the importance of every one of them. It is okay to be angry, sad, happy and afraid as long as we are taught how to manage them. The idea of having this control panel inside a human body has been done before by Osmosis Jones (2001), but let's say with much less success. Inside out takes it to the highest level of perfection. I loved the way Pixar made this world inside the main character of Riley, it is very creatively done and was in some ways just how I had imagined it. I must admit that I cried a couple of times during the movie, because it has some really touching moments. You should be feeling all emotions when watching Inside Out. It is a must watch."
" ""Who is in charge of programming down there?""
",2017-11-12 00:00:00,7,"I've never seen this before on IMDb - the first nine comments on the 'Best' reviews are the very same ones that come up on the 'Hated It' page. They utilize the words worst, boring, overrated, very boring, terrible, leave the theater, over simplified, and missed the point to describe the picture.So maybe there's some hope out there. My point being that the present day emphasis, especially on college campuses, seems to be about 'feelings' and a failure to effectively engage with reality. Anything considered negative is to be shunned or discriminated against, with alternative points of view to be banned outright. Sorry, but this leads to the next generation that can't effectively cope when things don't go their way. It's best exemplified in the movie when one of the characters proclaims ""Medals! Ribbons! Everyone's a winner!"" In my book, when everyone's a winner, no one is.But the thing is, the picture is wrapped up in all these pretty colors and it's easy to get lost in the sentimentality that goes with Goofball, Friendship and Imagination Islands. I actually thought all those memory towers were pretty cool looking with the myriads of bright colored balls representing past events. There's even some creativity involved with things like the Train of Thought (going all over the place), and the Islands of Personality.But over all, I didn't get a sense of a positive message coming out of this picture for young kids, which I presume is the target audience. Instead of learning how to cope in a new environment, Riley and her parents gave up and went back home to Minnesota instead of toughing it out for success in San Francisco. I guess they felt it was the right thing to do."
" What is the main idea?
",2017-10-18 00:00:00,3,Just finished the movie and somethings didn't exactly feel right. I mean first of all five emotions were acting like themselves except sadness. She wasn't sad she was clearly depressed. When you are sad you want to cry out your lungs yet she was hopeless and tired all the time. And the main message of the movie didn't make sense to me at all. The depression which Riley's been suffering was not something crying and experiencing the sadness would've fixed which she wasn't even denying being sad from the beginning just at some point sadness decided to go. And when it was back it stopped Riley from running away from home?How? Why?Was she sad she was going to be alone? I mean her feeling sad just should've made it harder and longer her acceptance of her new conditions for all I see with its presence.Or maybe sadness cornered her saying if you want to avoid pain avoid me just accept all of this I don't know maybe this was the message intended.
" Failed miserably
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,6,"Disney's animation never runs short of the idea. This one is again giving us something fresh, a girl with 5 living emotions inside her head. Unfortunately, it lacks the most important thing of an animation --- fun. Without fun, nothing is worth seeing. This movie is not fun for the kids, not fun for teens, and not fun for adults. It tried too hard to teach life lessons but it failed miserably. The movie is boring, below Disney's standard, and nothing to talk about."
" Inspiring and Entertaining
",2017-09-20 00:00:00,9,"I love this movie so much. It gives a very different aspect of thinking about your emotions in your mind. It is represented in a very entertaining but inspiring manner. It shows how every emotion is important to our life. So I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie which teaches us love, real love."
" An animation with an unique idea
",2017-09-08 00:00:00,8,"In a fantastic world where people had five main characters in their heads which represent joy, fear, anger, disgust and sadness, a young girl is about to enter the darkest period of her short but lovely life. When she's forced to move with her parents to another home in San Francisco, Hope and Sadness get accidentally sent away from headquarters, leaving Fear, Anger and Disgust to take care of everything. This is the part when all begins to go wrong and only the two main feelings can help her, if they actually manage to get back to the place where they belong.It's a very sentimental movie which presents the adventures of two characters as they try to find their way back through an endless maze filled with long-term memories. It's mostly sad and suspenseful, contrary to what I was expecting, briefly changing the mood from time to time with a funny sequence. I would have preferred a more joyful movie considering the premise it had, this way making it easier for everyone to enjoy. I had the impression I was watching a drama rather than a colorful and cheerful animation, which, by the way, was top notch as usual. Don't get me wrong, it's still a very good animation but pretty far away from the elite, unfortunately."
" Amazing!
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,10,"This is one of the greatest animated movies I've seen. It's amazing how you can teach so much to your audiences by making it fun, colorful and meaningful. Kids love it because the characters are fun to watch and they may relate to them. Teens can relate just so much because they can be facing those kind of situations themselves as they grow and start to ""change"" not just moving away. Adults also can learn from that. I think adults can learn so much more than kids and teens because they've been through those things and they can learn from their mistakes and they also can teach their kids so much more many things in such an easier way. With kindness, happiness and patience everything is achievable."
" Great film which makes your thinking go deeper
",2017-08-31 00:00:00,9,Disney never lets us down with their out of the box thinking trying to bring objects and feelings to life. A very entertaining film with great plot twists and simple jokes which will surely make you laugh.Great character sketches and development throughout the film makes it worth watching..
" I liked it.
",2017-08-26 00:00:00,7,"I'm rather surprised at all the one-star reviews. I rented it from Netflix at the recommendation of a friend who had enjoyed it, so I went into it knowing what to expect. I thought it was a cute, inventive and touching depiction of the emotional life of a tween. It even brought a tear to my eye near the end. I may never watch it again, but I love Disney & Pixar movies, and, although this wasn't my favorite, I have no reason to trash it. I thought the casting was great and personally found it to be an entertaining movie."
" interesting but not for kids
",2017-08-07 00:00:00,7,I watched it with my 5 year old daughter. She ended the movie almost crying. I would not recommend it for kids.I liked the originality of the story - emotions. How they manage one another - also different emotions for men and women. Very different from latest ones.It is just more for Adults / Teens.
" Only nuanced portrayal of manic-depression
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,10,"As someone who has been manic-depressive my entire life, an inheritance from the Sherman side of the family, I was delighted to finally see a portrayal of it, particularly of the depressive side, as a condition, not a disease. The spoiler here is that it is depressive side (sadness) which helps Riley find herself. Our depressive side is the root of our greater compassion and sympathy; It is when we are sad that we best hear the sadness of others. Our manic side is the root of our greater energy to solve problems, heedless of the risk to ourselves; it is when we are ecstatic that we dare to end the cause of the sadness of others.The world needs manic-depressives and would be a far worse place without them. What manic-depressives need more than anything else is family and community to ease the high and lows, but to emphasize that would be to treat manic-depression, not as a disease seeking a cure, but as a condition needing the nurture of a home, as this movie does."
" All ages
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,9,"I think this movie is not only for kids, it has the complexity of a very narrative movie, and also it makes you think about a lot of stuff. All those brain functions are so elaborate. My preferred character is Anger played by Lewis Black. Watch this movie guys, if you are 14 or 80 years old you will like it."
" One of My Favorite Movies
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,10,Inside Out Very confusing movie at first but its actually pretty good. Lot of emotions is this movie. Everything seems so confusing at first but once you get more into it starts making more sense. I feel like everything this movie shows we go trough it like the way the moods live inside our brains and so on
" Personification of Emotions
",2017-07-25 00:00:00,10,"(Flash Review)This is the most creative and brilliant way I have ever seen emotions visualized. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing how they envision a person's mind managing emotions and memories in granular ways. Very cool. The core plot is about the 5 primary emotions of this girl and how they help steer this girl through life as various life events impact her. The big impact was how she is effected and deals with a move from Minnesota to San Francisco and the challenges she faces. As all that happens the personified internal emotions try to maintain control. While much of the story is sad, it is also very touching and honest. There are plenty of comedic moments, energetic moments and adventures. This movie was very well thought out, smart and clever with colorful and vibrant animations."
" Amazing Movie !!!
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,8,This movie shows what a 11 year old thinks. The story maker has done a beautiful job in doing so. The movies shows many emotions and how they effect our life. I don't usually watch animations but this made me happy again after a long time.The way this movie revolves is just amazing. It makes you think about you and you're days when you we small. it shows us how emotions effect ourselves in different stages of our lives. It's a must watch.
" I want to like this movie but...
",2017-06-19 00:00:00,6,"I have seen this film twice. Most people seem to love it and regard it as one of the best Pixar films ever. I can't and I never will. This film is based on a not so every day struggle of a little girl having to go through leaving her friends and home town to a new city across country. Her parents are trying to make the best of it but things just aren't going their way. The girl, Riley, has five main emotions: joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust (The emotions are portrayed as humanoid characters). They run into trouble resulting in losing what are called Riley's ""core memories"" in her mind and need to find them immediately. However, joy and sadness get separated and need to find the core memories and get them back to the main HQ of Riley's mind. With Joy and Sadness gone, the other emotions frantically try to work Riley through every day life while Joy and Sadness are absent. They end up making things even worse for Riley and drive Riley to running away from home. Joy and Sadness find the core memories and make the journey back to HQ and restore Riley's happiness and sadness which compel her to run home to her worried parents. In the long run, the emotions grow stronger and realize each one of them is important to Riley's every day thoughts and emotions, even sadness. Now, while this sounds like a fairly decent plot, I can't say it was executed that well. Most of the movie is focused on the emotion characters, Joy and Sadness, and how Joy comes to realize Sadness is an important emotion just like her and Sadness realizes she is helpful and too, is important. But, we don't see this realization very clearly and it's kinda thrown at us at the end. Most of the journey Joy and Sadness endures is not very team building (between each other) and is pretty boring. While Joy and Sadness are missing, this should mean Riley can't feel those emotions because they aren't there in HQ controlling her expressions and thoughts. It's clear that Riley is not joyful or happy, but it is clear she is depressed, a form of sadness that she shouldn't be able to feel (a plot hole that is unexplained).For a movie based around emotions, I can't say the emotions are evenly expressed by any means. For the entire film, probably 60-70% is sad, 20% is joy, and the rest is the last emotions. I would have liked to have seen a more even spread of the emotions in Riley's struggle. Fear, Anger, and Disgust feel so under developed and practically worthless it's easy to forget they're even there.Not to mention, the imaginary friend, ""Bing Bong"" was not that much needed. He was needed because they needed a character to sacrifice for the ""greater good"". He was a well designed character and nicely developed, but was just a prop for one section of the film.Overall this movie was pretty bland. For a movie based on such a nice range of emotions, it really felt lack luster and dull. I did tear up a little at the end where Riley and her parents reunite, but I felt no emotions until the last maybe 15-20 minutes of the film. I can't say this was a bad movie, but it wasn't very good either. It was fine and I could watch it again, but not for a while."
" Movie can communicate on different tiers **may contain spoilers**
",2017-06-13 00:00:00,8,"I watched this moving not realizing what I was getting into. It explores the mind and emotions of a little girl and gives a great perspective into how the mind works. I found myself entertained and available the entire movie. The interesting part is that if you read about depression or anxiety, this movie has some similarities in how things are described.I find it interesting how the different emotions communicated and think that its a great way to have a young person understand emotions. My son watched this movie at the age of 7 and used it as an example several times when attempting to explain his thoughts.From start to finish, I think this movie did a great job of displaying how to controls ones emotions as well as how we all think differently.The scene with the parents emotional icons showing was classic and a great example of differentiating how men and women think differently."
" A very creative and fun movie.
",2017-06-13 00:00:00,10,"Here's a movie that has the creativity and genius of a movie that animated movies have lacked for years. Considering that some animation studios (notably DreamWorks) have been struggling to try to get an original idea for years, ""Inside Out"" shows that Pixar still has the magic that made their previous movie classics. This movie is one of the best animated movies in years and is the very definition of an instant classic. It will be remembered years into the future. I haven't seen a film this creative and imaginative in a long, long time and I loved every single minute of it.The film focuses on the personalized emotions of a girl named Riley. Each one of them has a specific color and personality to make them unique. They also have distinct voices. Joy is played by Amy Poehler, Sadness by Phyllis Smith, Fear by Bill Hader, Disgust by Mindy Kaling, and Anger by Lewis Black. They live at the center of Riley's head called headquarters and control her personality. All the emotions get along with each other except Joy and Sadness. Joy doesn't want Sadness controlling Riley as she wants Riley to have a happy life along with the fact that when she touches a memory which is basically encased in a sphere, it becomes sad. One day though, Riley's life is turned upside down when her parents decide to move away from her home in Minnesota to an unpleasant house in San Fransisco.  Joy tries to control Riley enjoy the move, but Sadness gets in the way and makes a large impact that I dare not spoil. Through a series of mishaps, Joy and Sadness are transported far away from the headquarters to another area of the memory and they need to get back to headquarters as soon as possible.The story is one of the most creative stories I've seen not just in an animated movie, but in a movie in general. The ideas that are in this movie are so ingenious as it shows us the working of certain areas of the mind and makes them so unique and memorable. It has so many hilarious and emotional moments that it reminded me a lot of ""Up"" which wasn't a surprise as both of these films were directed by the same director. The characters are also a lot of fun. Amy Poehler is great as she always is as Joy and another stand out was Lewis Black as Anger who was pretty hilarious in this movie. The animation is also breathtaking. It's bright and colorful and has many details that make it stand out. For example, the emotions really have shiny details to them which reminded me a lot of colored sugar. I also enjoyed how bouncy and fun Riley's head was compared to the dull dreary real world. That balance is what I expect to see in animated movie and I love that they included it.""Inside Out"" is not only the best animated movie of 2015, it's one of the best animated movies ever made. I have not seen a film this likable and creative in a while and I'm so glad that this film is another standout from the incredible Pixar. It's such a breathtaking film that you must have to see it for yourselves. It truly is a wonderful experience."
" Just a bunch of hype
",2017-06-03 00:00:00,4,This not a 8.2 it is a 4. The acting is pretty good. The story line is just so so. I have seen worst. There are better movies out there that are nothing like this one. Godzilla is better. So is King Kong. I did not know what all the hype is about. It really is not a big deal. It might have worked as a short film. But for 1 hour and 35 minutes it gets a little trying. If you think this an 8.2 or better that is fine with me. I do not see what the big deal is here. But fine. If you have not seen this movie do not wast your time. And do not wast your money. You have been warned this is not a movie you really need to see in spite of what people say.
" Growing up can be a bumpy road
",2017-06-02 00:00:00,9,"Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions: Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith). The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley's mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house, and school."
" Confused Emotions, Inside Out
",2017-06-01 00:00:00,2,"Call me late to the draw, but this two-year-old film Inside Out has me more upset than its preteen protagonist, Riley.Why was Riley upset? Why am I upset?All of Riley's emotions are purely reactive. They are simply responses to external stimuli, not the least of which are the emotions of her parents. This misplaced emphasis on externals is surprising, given the professed aim of the film: to look at human experience from the inside out.""There's absolutely no reason for Riley to be happy right now,"" states one emotion mater-of-factly to another.Every experience may be an opportunity for either joy or sadness. But the film makes it look as if we are controlled by emotions, and it is circumstances which control us through our emotional responses to them.Problem with the film: the film conflates joy with happiness and joy with love. These are not the same thing.Another problem with the film: even memories are cast as amenable to reordering, disposal and forgottenness.Our core memories shape our realities, which are presented as simply a reflection of our perceptions accumulated and understood over time. Our personalities are shaped by memories which influence our response to what we perceive as or experiences day-to-day. When Joy and Sadness go missing, everything goes haywire. Personality ""Islands"" are depicted as unstable; they shake and fall and crash to the ground. Imaginary friends like the elephant-teddy-bear Bing Bong are depicted as ridiculous and incredible.Abstract thought is depicted as imaginary (!!). (So much for the history of human experience, culture and civilization . . .)Ultimately, experiences are depicted as meaningless as soon as they are forgotten.**SPOILER ALERT** Riley, through no fault of her own, is driven to react with anger and run away from home.The entirety of her personality is depicted as responsive and reactive—responsive to the emotions with which she is presented and reactive to the circumstances which she encounters. The idea is that giving Joy an inordinate place is unreality. All emotions are important and therefore to be valued and given an airing.In the end, Sadness DOES have a purpose. She helps Riley (and us) process life.There IS a moral to the story. Rather than trying to ""fix"" emotions, we should accept them and process them as they present themselves to us. (Perhaps this is why the tireless Joy is presented as a bit of an egocentric.)But if all emotions are equally valuable, why give priority to Joy? And if Joy is not given priority, we are opening ourselves up to a very Sad, Fearful, Angry and Disgusted alternate universe.Perhaps that encapsulates my feelings on the matter. Angry and Disgusted.When the plot resolves, **SPOILER ALERT** it is only by coming to terms with the grief over her childhood hockey disappointments and her imaginary friend Bing Bong's sacrifice through Sadness that Riley's redemption and Joy's return to the Control Center of the brain are made possible. Sadness has a part to play, after all. I do admit that it's okay to feel. I do think that childhood memories play an important part in the formation of personality. And I do value the role of Sadness in the processing of these and other emotions. But I feel less Joy than Anger, less Sadness than Disgust as this film draws to a close. The assumption of the movie that troubles me the most is that emotions are presented as the primary processors of reality. Emotions are all there is. Imagination is nonsensical and problematic. There is no soul beyond the emotions—no reason to speak of. I do appreciate the film for its playfulness, creativity and colour. As a spectacle, it is appealing though not spectacular. And I do like the repetitive running joke about TripleDent gum . . .But this is not a children's movie, not the adventure reel of delightful music and happy endings we have come to know and love. Only Sadness can bring Riley back to feeling. And therein lies a major flaw in the central message of the film—it is on the centrality of circumstance, not emotions, that our final focus is placed. The film ends convincing us less of the validity of emotions than of the pressures of circumstance. Joy does not win; Sadness does. In this sense the film is not a comedy.Nor is it an accurate representation of reality, inside or out."
" A brilliant depiction of adolescence
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,10,"As an adult, I love animated films but the trailers made this one look like it was really just for kids. I gave it a shot anyway and I didn't expect to love it--but it's depth absolutely shocked me. Not only is it a whimsical, funny film, but the poetry is off the charts.The creators of this film truly remember what it was like to be a child and continue to express understanding to children's feelings today. Riley is a light hearted little girl on the cusp of adolescence, approaching that turbulent age where everything changes and it seems like there is no one there to help you.Riley's emotions are portrayed using colorful creatures inside her head. Joy has been the ringleader of the emotions up until now, but Riley's life changes are starting to shake things up and Sadness has begun to take over. Truly amazing how this was depicted! Absolutely brilliant.As a kid, adults are often dismissing your emotions and never listening to you when you need them most. Often times kids cannot express themselves and turn to anger, panic or disgust, all emotions that will only heighten your problems as Riley comes to learn.When Joy finally lets Sadness take the reins and Riley opens up to her parents and they actually LISTEN to her...it is breathtaking.Don't miss out on this movie, definitely a must see! Amazing voice cast, beautiful visuals and a wonderful message to people of all ages."
" Great flick for animation
",2017-05-03 00:00:00,8,"The movie gets into deepest emotions and personalities in humans in a funny way instead of being too serious all the time, as humans tend to be.Everything is not controlled about our emotions. Through out the movie you will get to understand that every emotion and feeling is indeed necessary for survival."
" Amazing movie loved it a lot!
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,10,This is such a good movie because I have 2 kids and they wouldn't stop laughing during watching this. I can not believe where they get these ideas from but it was a really good idea and my kids loved it. A lot of people love this movie because it is kid friendly and a good movie to watch when you are bored it will make you cry laugh 😂😂
" Must watch and beautifully created.
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,9,"What a movie! No other words. I love watching animation movie. And i think this one deserve my must watch movie. Very calmly executed and Awesome concept and chromatography. I feel this is way too close what exactly happen in inside our mind every time we do something. I just loved it. Very nice. Go n watch, you won't be disappointed i guarantee."
" Over Simplified
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,1,"I get that this is a kids film & they were trying to use simple ways of showing how emotions are formed but I can't forgive the fact that the whole plot was about how a little girl was suffering from depression because, due to a clerical error, happiness was out of office. & the final lesson just felt like ""Cry & everything will be alright"". Given how much praise this film was receiving (let alone it's a Pixar film) I was hoping for a much smarter explanation of emotions.Also most other aspects of the film just weren't funny/enjoyable."
" Disney-Pixar comedy about emotions seems to operate more on mania than anything else
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,5,"Computer-animated family film from Pixar Animation Studios and released by Disney, about the emotional scramble going on inside the brain of a normal, healthy little girl, is extraordinarily bright and colorful--and yet hyperactive, with overlapping dialogue that rushes by at such a fast clip one might think the sound designers and everyone else involved with the film were feeling the effects of a sugar rush. There's not much to the narrative (trouble-causing Sadness and ringleader Joy have to find their way out of the kid's long-term memory storage), while most of the attention is focused on the child's five basic emotions (the girl, Riley, and her parents rarely come to the fore as actual characters). Kids seem to enjoy the film because it's fluorescent and energetic, like a cereal commercial on television. With so much slapstick and shouting, it could easily compete with a restless child's attention span--and win. ** from ****"
" The worst kids movie ever
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,1,Plese do not watch this movie its not age appropriate and its a complete mess. Rather watch a root canal in the making. Why does it rate so high?? Even my kids told me to change the movie because it was giving them headaches. Way too many characters to keep track of. What was this movie about? Its is beyond comprehension.
" What would another emotion be?
",2017-03-23 00:00:00,5,"I should start by saying that I'm not any fan of Disney movies. Even so, ""Inside Out"" is an interesting look at the evolution of human emotions and the problems that people can have adjusting to a new location. I particularly liked the part where they showed dreams getting produced Hollywood-style. My personal favorite of the emotions was Anger, just because I liked the way that he was always about to explode. If there were another emotion in Riley's head, maybe it would be cynicism (is that considered an emotion?). I haven't seen any of 2015's other nominees for Best Animated Feature, so I can't compare this one, but it seems as though they only award Disney movies.And of course I can't avoid talking about the cast. Amy Poehler and Bill Hader are former ""Saturday Night Live"" cast members (co-star Bobby Moynihan still is). Lewis Black does skits in the persona of someone approaching a mental breakdown, so he's the perfect person to voice Anger. Mindy Kaling is best known as a comedian, but made a good point about the lack of attention paid to the recent murder of an Indian-American (by someone who said ""Get out of our country!""). This is the first that I've ever heard of Phyllis Smith or Richard Kind. Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan are pretty well known. Paula Poundstone had been around for years before I heard about her (and I heard about her due to her run-in with the law). Frank Oz is best known for his Muppets work but has also directed a number of movies, including one called ""In & Out"" (IMDb needs to include that in the trivia). Flea is a member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. John Ratzenberger voiced the piggy bank in ""Toy Story"". Rashida Jones is Quincy Jones's daughter.All in all, a pretty enjoyable movie."
" A bit Self-Indulgent on the part of Pixar Employees
",2017-03-21 00:00:00,1,"Originality: 0/10. The whole ""personality attributes as characters"" thing has been done to death at least since ancient Greece. That being said, originality is not necessary for entertainment (eg: pretty much all Disney classic animated features, Shakespeare,...)Appeal to kids: 0/10. None of the characters speak or behave ""kid"". They're adults. Making adult quips and using adult language about adult topics. Even the environment wasn't ""kid"".Appeal to tweens: 2/10. Maybe tween girls would like Joy. Her look and sound were about as generic ""princess"" as you could find.Appeal to teens: 3/10. Teen girls given to deeper subjects might find the movie inventive and cool. Kind of like ""teen dystopia"" was, a few years ago. Niche.Appeal to adults: 5/10. Any parent of a tween/teen girl who has been through any drama (and all parents of tween/teen girls have or are going through drama). More for the notion of the teen girl drama than the movie itself. I couldn't see that it would appeal to teen boys at all. Although the single scene of ""inside the boy's head"" was hilariously ""spot on"" :)Appeal to tech industry adults of tween/teens (especially girls) who have relocated to the Bay Area from suburban Midwest (or suburban South): 8/10. A small group. The Bay Area is full and largely unaffordable (and unaccommodating) to incoming families. Most especially to those not receiving a pair of high tech incomes. The house the movie family moved into in SF would easily be in the $1.5- 2M range and there'd be a line of people to buy it. I don't think you can sell your $300k house and roll into a $2M fixer-upper.This is the one movie (of ~600, all from BD/DVDs we own, mind you) my wife said: ""Don't bother to put this one on the server. Nothing about it was good.""Both of us, SF tech boom people. Through 3 booms. And both of us originally from Midwest, but have lived all over (every major ""tech town"").I play with CGI but it wasn't even redeeming for that. Nothing struck me as ""wow!"" in the tech used to make the movie. Really... it felt like Pixar parents telling their own story, not very creatively and on a tighter budget. Oh well."
" Loved it!!
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,10,"Simply stroke of a genius! Loved it!!! , and I am not a kid so can understand feel & relate with the message of Joy & Sadness, & going through the phase of anxiety and mixed emotions up to being completely numb from unexpected relocation to a completely new & unknown place. And while we can pretend every thing rosy for a school age child but real life doesn't works like that ! Give the writer ,director & the artists who performs the voice of joy , sadness and Anger an Oscar ! :) Probably the best animated movie in all terms that I have seen yet! and the best artistic work of Pixar !10 out of 10 !!!!"
" The movie was great! It teaches many important life lessons
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,10,"Understanding another person is one of the most difficult tasks a human being experiences. Children, teenagers, and even adults, often gain their knowledge of the world through their surroundings. Since, electronic devices, which display movies and TV shows, are prevalent in today's society, audiences often gravitate to those forms of entertainment and absorb the information. Good movies leave lasting impacts on the minds and hearts of the people who watch the works. In Disney Pixar's Inside Out, the personified emotions that control peoples' feelings, and the core memory spheres are a vital role in a child's understanding of life.The five emotions stationed in the young girl, Riley's, mind, Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Anger, and Fear, teach people that the way they feel corresponds to the way they act. If everyone could look into another's head, as audiences viewed in Inside Out, understanding the human race would not be a difficult topic. However, that is not the case. Since this movie directly addresses the thoughts in a human's head, even children can understand the emotions better. The color differentiation of each emotion not only draws attention, but also allows people to understand that there are different ways they can feel. Additionally, this movie allows audiences to understand the human nature by personifying the emotions in another person's head. These specific emotions individually and physically control what Riley does, which directly shows that there is a correspondence between the way a person feels to their actions. The way a human feels controls how they act. For example, when a person is sad, they cry, or when they happy they smile. This movie shows that emotion, thoughts, and actions are all connected: emotions control actions, actions control thoughts and thoughts control how the person feel. In addition to these emotions, the core memory spheres show children that as they grow older, they will have a mixture of emotions in their memories, not just one at a time.Core memories are important to a development of a child, and Inside Out shows audiences that as people mature, their mind changes with them. The main character, Riley, during the movie is a prepubescent ""tween"" who moves to a new city. Throughout the events of the movie, Riley only has simplistic feelings. This is directly shown in the movie when only one control platform, and only one emotion controls her at a time. In the end clips of the movie, the audiences get a glimpse of the emotions inside other characters head, including the the main character's parents. The glimpse presents the ""matured"" minds of her parents, showing all the emotions sitting in a large console where all the emotions can act at together in an organized fashion. Riley's mind, is a mess throughout most of the movie. The events depicted in her mind, show all the emotions cramming together on one small monitor, fighting over who controls her. However, after the events of the movie, Riley's maturing mind beings going through ""puberty"" as the character, Disgust, points out, and shows all the emotions working together in an ""upgraded"" control console. Additionally, all of her core memory orbs are only one specific emotion, joy.Children must learn that they can not be happy all the time, and in the movie, Inside Out, children can better understand they need to experience all emotions. As shown in the movie, Riley's core memories all gleam gold, representing that all her important memories in her life were happy. Joy, who primarily directs the emotions, leads the group and takes over the control board, not allowing Sadness to participate in anything. As Riley tries to run away, her emotions in the control room, not including Joy and Sadness, try to stop her from leaving. Since Joy and Sadness are lost outside the control room, Disgust tries to lead as Joy does and tells Fear to ""scare"" Riley into staying. However, all the emotions could not get her to feel anything. The lever, telling Riley to react, would not budge. As Joy and Sadness return to the room after their unexpected adventure, the bus Riley is riding begins pulling out. Joy, realizing Sadness is the only emotion that can save Riley, tells Sadness to work the control board. Sadness, hesitantly reaches for the lever and pulls in down. Riley jerks up and runs off the bus, going home. This shows children, that being sadness is an essential emotion, and not a bad. This movie shows that being sad is good, and shows that people are human. As, she enters her house, her parents run and hug her. Riley, starts telling her parents how awful the move was for her and Joy hands Sadness Riley's happy core memories, and they turn blue as they are projected in her mind. Riley begins to cry and smile as her family embraces, and a blue and gold swirled memory orb forms in her head. This specific orb shows, that memories are a mix of emotions. This specific scene shows the sadness Riley feels, mixed with the happy emotions of family. After this specific event, Riley's mind Is shows stronger as ever, with multiples of mixed emotions including fear and disgust. These specific scenes show kids that emotions are not simplistic, that people grow and mature feeling different emotions at the same time.In the children's movie, Inside Out, people are controlled by five specific emotions, which teach audiences important parts of human life. In modern culture, movies often impact people's minds. Human minds share a connection between, acting, feeling and thinking. Empathy is a feeling not many people experience on a daily basis, but through this movie, it is achievable."
" Entertaining, But Not As ""On Point"" As Other Pixar Efforts
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,6,"Toy Story...Wall-E...Up...Finding Nemo...etc. When a company (Pixar) makes films of that caliber, it is a difficult task to keep ""upping the ante"" with subsequent releases. While ""Inside Out"" is (at the very least) entertaining, it doesn't quite live up to the bar of greatness set by previous Pixar installments.For a basic plot summary, ""Inside Out"" tells the story of an 11-year old girl named Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias), who is moving from Minnesota to San Francisco. This is obviously a big change in Riley's life, and it is when we are introduced to the emotions inside her head: Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), & Disgust (Mindy Kaling). All of Riley's outward emotions are controlled by these core emotions in the ""command center"" of her brain. As Riley struggles to acclimate to her new home, school, and environment, these emotions struggle to figure out their place in the overall scheme of her personality.The concept behind ""Inside Out"" is original and entertaining. It's fun/interesting to see our emotions represented like that, and it provides for both some very happy/uplifting, as well as very sad/depressing, moments throughout. In terms of original concept and interesting ideas, ""Inside Out"" may actually be one of Pixar's best.However, I found the execution of those ideas to be only so-so. I had two complaints (this is coming from an adult perspective, of course) while watching the movie...1. When the camera ""pulls back"" to see Riley interacting with her parents and environment, that is when this film works the best. However, a majority of the film is spent inside Riley's brain dealing with the emotions themselves. For example, a subplot involving Joy being separated from the command center takes up quite a bit of time. I just wish things could have been a bit more balanced.2. More so than any other Pixar film, ""Inside Out"" seems to really ""go for the cry"", so to speak. I've never been in a theater where so many sniffles and even outright sobbing could be heard. I have no problem with that at face value, as great films are supposed to grab at the emotions, but this one just felt expressly made to do so. I shed some tears at the end of ""Toy Story 3"" and at the beginning of ""Up"", but I really feel that was because those montages were so well-made and natural to the plot of those films. With ""Inside Out"", at times I felt like the entire point of the experience was to have parents bawling.That being said, even though this one didn't rank as high as other Pixar efforts in my book, it was still fun to watch. I thoroughly enjoyed the unique concept and really liked the parts where the emotions in Riley's (and her parents') brain directly influence conversations and interactions in the real world. Highly recommended for all audiences and (as usual) perfect for families. But be warned: if you are a parent, you might want to keep a few tissues handy."
" Excellent movie
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,9,"I consider it to be an important movie to watch growing up - it had helped my little sister overcome her mental problems (as much as she could) and improve her relationships with other. She says this movie has inspired her.The moment Riley considered (and did so) leaving her parents is based on true facts; I am surrounded by children around her age and I see that this is how they behave when they meet the same situation as our character did in the movie. I find it extremely concerning, since children nowadays are a lot more easily bothered by unfortunate life events and see things differently from how we used to when we were their age. I think that Inside Out is a very good warning for both parents and kids. We learn how Riley was misunderstood by her parents (due to lack of communication) and how it lead to her decision of running away. Thus, it ends with a lesson learned by the characters and the viewers.The story line is exciting, suitable for people of all ages, amusing, with what seem to be simple characters who own bigger back stories. I recommend watching Inside Out if you're happy, bored, or going through a rough time. I simply recommend seeing it, in case you haven't already!Rated 9/10 because I personally think it was predictable, however I didn't manage to find any other problems."
" Pixar Has Another Home Run
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,9,"I loved this movie and it is definitely not a kids movie. This one is aimed at Mom & Dad. Yes it is an animated film but that is what Pixar does best, or only. The peak into the human mind and seeing each emotion and watching as memories are created and stored is stellar screen writing. The emotions of Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust and Fear are given life as real characters who steer the young girl Riley, who's life we follow from birth to age 13. It takes great imagination to write a story like this and I applaud Pixar for this one. The scene where the parents are trying to deal with a very sad, angry Riley and the look at what is going on the their heads is downright hilarious. The fathers emotions should dealing with the situation at hand but instead they are all watching imaginary hockey."
" Best Pixar film since Toy Story 3
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,10,"I absolutely love this movie. Filled with a concept that is nothing short of genius, it's the story of an 11- year-old girl named Riley. She has just moved from Minnesota to San Francisco into an old run-down house. Her five emotions, personified as characters (Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Anger and Fear), try to help her through this difficult time. She has a hard time finding friends in her new school. TThehen something happens that makes her situation even worse. I won't spoil that here, but it is absolutely brilliant. The characters are just so lovable. The voice casting was 100% perfect. There's no real villain in this movie, and I personally have no problem with that. Finding a flaw in this film would be too big of a chore, so I won't even try.I encourage everyone to watch this movie. You won't regret it."
" Inside Out is a Great Movie with a Simple, Innocent Plot
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,8,"Inside Out is a very nice movie with a simplistic story line. The illustration and behaviour of the different emotions is very interesting to watch, and the ways in which they affect Riley's behaviour is also fun to watch. The characters are very well- illustrated and appear likable, and the emotions' interactions with each other don't make them lose their identities as either anger, joy, sadness, fear, or disgust. Still, they are able to take on some aspects of each other's personalities in away that doesn't compromise their own. Inside Out is very simple, compared to many other Disney Movies, but enjoyable nonetheless. It is very smooth and natural, and some knowledge in psychology helps in understanding many parts. The movie could have been better if the plot was more diverse.*8.5/10*"
" What an insightful movie to help explain emotions!
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,8,"What an insightful movie to help explain emotions! Perfect for everyone in the family and an excellent tool to get young people talking about what emotions are and how they feel. Easily relatable, for most viewers. Pixar/Disney artists did a wonderful job with color and animation. The emotions/core memories are solid and primary colored at the beginning of the movie. By the end of the movie the viewer starts to see a mixture of colors in the core memories. Giving the viewer the perspective that one emotion cannot exist without the others. Brilliant explanation with visual concepts! The actor's playing the ""emotions"" – Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Anger (Lewis Black), Fear (Bill Hader) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling), all made their voices come to life on the big screen. The sound effects and Foley artist (Alyson Dee Moore), made the characters come to life and feel real. The primary emotions are: Joy, Anger, Sadness, Fear, Disgust. The viewer gets the feeling that the writers of this movie, Pete Docter and Ronnie Del Carmen, have had their share of emotionally charged young people, to have made this writing flow so easily. As a parent, it was easy for many to relate to these emotions from a child's perspective. Elementary for the first few years, as Riley, the main character, could only understand one emotional feeling at a time. Which is exactly how a child can move from one thing to another without major chaotic overtones in their lives. At the age of 11, Riley's family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco. Life does not go as simply and easily as it had in the past. The emotions she starts to feel or doesn't feel, all start to become overwhelming and Riley gets to be downright empty. Playing in perfectly with the missing emotions, Joy and Sadness. Completely fitting for a preteen and many of the emotional struggles young people have. All of Riley's decisions rest in the hands of Fear, Disgust, and Anger, for a good portion of the movie and they are not only at odds at how to handle the situations, but lost without their leader, Joy. As the movie progresses, Joy and Sadness meet the imaginary friend Riley had as a child, Bing Bong. The three wonder from one memory island to the next, attempting to get back to the Headquarters, AKA, the brain. Bing Bong gives his existence away to save Riley from running away. Which is a great example of how imaginary friends from childhood, seemingly vanish from our minds, the older we become – as if they never existed. Joy and Sadness, come to the rescue, saving Riley from fully following through with running away, and work together, getting Riley to return home and telling her parents how she really feels about the big changes in her life. As the movie comes to the end, the viewer is pulled into the onset of puberty and feeling that Riley is going to be okay with all these changes ahead of her in life. Her emotions are as excited about life, as Riley is about her passion for hockey. A timeless adventure, helping to explain why and how we feel, through the eyes of child."
" A very good movie understanding a teenagers life and feelings
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,8,"I was excited once i was going to watch this, seeing the trailers and thinking it was just a funny animated movie. Once i watched it, it made me think. About how we can be so eaten up by our feelings and emotions that we forget our family and loved ones, how much they wan't to be there for us and help us in any time of life. Sometimes we just wan't to get away, but that's not always the best choice. I really loved watching this film, it's a good learner and reminder of how a teenagers life can be and is. Bullying, embarrassment, breakdowns and not always getting what you wish for but still having a hint about what you currently got. I recommend this movie for pretty much anyone, especially for people that got kids and are in the same situation and need a reminder what really matters in life even tho it might not be the best time for you and your family right now."
" A perfect blend of joy and sadness
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,10,"This was clearly written, acted, and directed by people who really understand the subtle shades of emotion. ""Inside Out"" ranks alongside ""Up"" for beautiful, intelligent story-telling. The comedy is well-done, providing plenty of laughs without overwhelming the story, so the film stands up to repeated viewing. Fair warning: if you go in expecting laugh-a-minute, mindless slapstick, then you'll probably be disappointed. But if you are willing to acknowledge Sadness, you will be rewarded with a story that stays with you long after the credits are finished.TL;DR? Ignore the haters, and enjoy being turned inside out."
" mind blowing
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,10,"Excuse the silly pun but I've just re-watched INSIDE OUT (DVD release) and I want to watch it over and over again, the way kids doThe movie is set in an usual place for a cartoon; there is no magic, no princess, no evil monster, no singing (!!).You start thinking that one character is the lead or more important than the others, and end up realizing that they are all interdependent, more closely knit than you expected; they only work well when counterbalanced by one another.Don't google the plot, let yourself be charmed and pleasantly surprisedwww.thesmartfashionistas.com"
