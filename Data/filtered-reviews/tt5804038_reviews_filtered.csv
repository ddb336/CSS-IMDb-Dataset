" Awful boring drone voice over
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,2,I would like to have finished this documentary but injustice I isn't stand Samuel l Jackson's boring monologue. Why did he have to speak like that. It's a real shame.
" Fantastic
",2021-03-23 00:00:00,10,"If people claim not to know about the history of racial tension, violence, and oppression in America it comes down to simple avoidance of facts. Baldwin makes a compelling case for discovering the history of America through the eyes of Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. America would do well to not turn away."
" Outstanding. love James Baldwin
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,10,Baldwin remains relevant to this very day. You watch this and think unfortunately that Baldwin could be writing about 2020
" Compulsory political document for all citizens in USA
",2021-02-18 00:00:00,9,"Very strong movie, compulsory for all citizens in the United Stats to watch and know their country. A politically deep film, full of intersectionality (race, class, gender, sexuality, imperialism), that highlight many lies which sustain USA self misunderstanding. James Baldwin was a quite impressive writer and thinker and it is a striking delight to listen his ""unconvenient"" social diagnosis. Apartheid regime with clear Nazi elements and the long standing survival of institutional racism are not compatible to US self image of ""land of the free"". Baldwin's brilliant text, very well narrated by Samuel L. Jackson, great interviews, and lots of historic, cinema, television and advertising footage representative of dire racism in the imperialist country... all those elements are well connected in a powerful political film."
" Makes a fascinating individual seem bland
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,5,"This film tackles a somewhat overlooked and important voice in American history in examining the work of James Baldwin, an essayist and playwright who perhaps more penetratingly than other, more visible civil rights leaders of his time skewered the shadowy psychology of white America's racial attitudes. ""I Am Not Your Negro"" highlights several of Baldwin's more forceful observations, notably America's need for an ""other,"" as he tasks Americans to ask ourselves why we need and rely on that othering.While my personal take on Baldwin's commentary is that his points are alternately illuminating and meanderingly obscure, I was excited to see a film that would give me a greater appreciation for the man and his legacy. I was hoping to gain from the film a deeper insight into Baldwin's writing, motivations, and personal history.Unfortunately this film disappointed me, as I felt there was little of Mr. Baldwin's personal journey revealed and even less of his writing. The film, like many recent documentaries and biopics that draw from a limited body of source material, relied heavily on still photographs and oblique references to Hollywood films to fill out screen-time. I despise this filmmaking cliche as it tends to divorce the visual elements of the film from the narrative elements.However in the case of ""I Am Not Your Negro,"" this is almost a moot point, as there does not seem to be much of a narrative arc at all. The film begins with the premise that in the final years of his life, Baldwin was writing a treatment of the assassinated civil rights leaders Malcolm X, Medgar Evers, and Dr. King. Little more is mentioned throughout the film's 90 minutes of this unfinished work and what became of it, or indeed what other pressures hindered Baldwin in the 1980s.The movie's best moments invoke archival footage of Baldwin speaking passionately in front of audiences and on talk shows. His uniquely articulate resistance to the idea that he should buy in to a white American value system by making, as he puts it, ""a leap of faith,"" underscores a profound difference in black and white understandings of America. Director Raoul Peck uses clips from John Wayne and Sidney Poitier films rhetorically throughout the film to support this thesis.""I Am Not Your Negro"" however relies too heavily on questionable tangents and fails to coherently communicate what its ultimate message is. I found the film less than compelling, and sadly learned little from watching it I didn't already know."
" Dont Believe These Reviews
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,4,"Did they change the film recently or something? What I just watched cant be what garnered these reviews here. I see absolutely nothing worthy of these 8/9/10 star reviews. I know art is subjective but really? It's all archived footage...no new clips, no new people, no new info. I don't consider myself a history buff, not a huge of documentaries, I'm just average black womans who likes to stay informed...perhaps the target for this is someone who typically doesn't. I just don't get the point of it...and it was all over the place. I wanted to like it, and hate saying anything negative about it. But I know others out there have to feel the same and chose not to share it for whatever reason...I wish they had and saved me the lost time."
" If you are white like meit & believe things are better now, this film will crush that facade. WATCH IT!!
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,10,"I am a life long student and teacher of history, politics and sociology. I am more than a little ashamed and embarrassed that I did not know who James Baldwin was. Peck did an incredible job of bringing Baldwin's beliefs and perspective to the collective table. There is some really hard truth spoken and shown here but if we cannot start looking the truth of our past in the eyes, we will not only continue to be blind and ignorant, we will curse our children to limp through life with the same maladies. We simply cannot afford to raise another ignorant white generation. Black Lives Matter to me. Why? I am a middle aged southern white woman with 4 children. I feel a debt to the black men and women who bravely paved the way, who paid the price of our Inheritance, to teach my 4 children that their whiteness is not free. I have more to learn and I know my opinions and feelings about race in American society are going to evolve but I certainly hope our society as a whole will evolve as well. One of several GLARING truths Baldwin/Peck held up to the mirror was the images from the early civil rights era of 50's and 60's and the images from 2000's-PRESENT. The ONLY difference is the technology on which the images were filmed. Our white sight is in need of an updated prescription. It is easy to ""see"" with my white person eyes that which I desperately want to see, that things ARE better, the lines are blurring. It is and it isn't. Mostly it isn't. This is why we need to be shown truth that isn't watered down, easy to digest or necessarily compatible with the white palate. We need a constant reality check because it is IMPOSSIBLE to ""see"" with another's eyes. We can only be shown, told and taught and endeavor to remember we did not pay for what we have been given and to remember that in the whole of American history almost all of those Black Lives who did pay and a majority of those who continue to pay are STILL not entitled in large part to the fruit of that labor. WATCH this movie!"
" Kind of scary
",2020-08-21 00:00:00,8,"This is an extremely dark, and extremely real documentary. Disturbing in the worst way possible."
" I Am Not Your Negro
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,7,"I had heard the title of this film at the time of its release during Awards Season, and then the #BlackLivesMatter movement swept the world, following the events in America in 2020, the killing of George Floyd in a racist police attack. It was during this time that television showed many films and programmes concerning the treatment of black people, racism, and other prejudice throughout history, including this documentary. Basically, James Baldwin, known in modern times for writing the novel If Beale Street Could Talk, was an American novelist, playwright, essayist, poet, and activist. During the 50s, 60s and 70s, Baldwin became a big part of the Civil Rights movement, who saw racism as a psychological flaw as much as a social prejudice. This film examines the history of the treatment, portrayal, and negative stereotyping of black people in America, through the poetic, sonorous words of Baldwin, from his unfinished memoir, Remember This House, and the various letters he wrote. Samuel L. Jackson delivers a fantastic tender narration reading these words, and they are heard during a montage of various news, film, and television clips of black people related to what is being said. This includes Baldwin discussing the segregation, with ""coloured"" bathrooms, seating on public transport and other horrible sights, the various protests, the powerful campaigns by important black figures, and the murders of Baldwin's murdered friends, including Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. It also includes negative imagery of black people of the past, including horrible cartoon caricatures and in the media, minstrels on stage and screen, slaves and servants in households, and stereotypes, secondary characters and other unjust images in film, television, and advertising. Thankfully, there are also some of the positive events that paved the way for positive attitudes towards black people, including films starring Hattie McDaniel (the first black actress to win an Academy Award), Harry Belafonte, and Sidney Poitier (the first leading black actor to win the Oscar), the music of artists including Ray Charles, the changes in society following the actions of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King among others, and monumental events for the black culture, including the election of the first African American President of the United States, Barack Obama, with First Lady Michelle Obama. It is shocking to see what black people had to go through in the old days, and that some of these issue still exist today, and this melancholic film really delivers the message that society and attitude needs to change for the better, a fascinating and most profound and poignant documentary. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature Very good!"
" Absolutely Phenomenal. Urgent. Moving.
",2020-08-12 00:00:00,10,Words written here cannot convey how important and affecting this film is. Baldwin is on fire as always. First rate deeply intelligent use of archive footage and a stellar narration by Sam Jackson as the voice of the author. Watch and tell others to watch.
" Pertinent Today
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,7,"(Flash Review)The footage was plucked out of the 1960s but could be inserted into 2020 and not miss a beat. This documentary focuses on James Baldwin who was a notable civil rights author of his time. Much of the file footage is Baldwin speaking during interviews or lecturing while wrapping his influence in correlation to the deaths of Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. Baldwin is a very personable figure and his footage easily carried the film and he raises many good points, many still applicable today. Yet he raised one questions I've never heard asked, which I would be curious to hear an answer to: Paraphrasing: ""the white people created the N-word; the question needing asking is why?"" In order to get to the core of the problem."
" Stark And Unflinching
",2020-07-16 00:00:00,9,"A clear-eyed, focussed documentary drawing on James Baldwin's final and unfinished novel, that presents now as a meditation on the story of race in the USA. Samuel L Jackson is the narrator, reading Baldwin's intelligent, fierce and unflinchingly factual prose with the sort of brave understatement that allows the prose to sing and reality to land unforgettably in the viewer's mind. On several occasions, Baldwin's words are read over imagery of more recent incidents relating to race in USA; and what scares me as I watch is how little seems to have changed. The simple act of setting pictures of apparently fearless white supremacists marching the streets in the last few years as writing from 40 years ago is read hits in the deepest parts of us. It made me think deeply, but emotionally it left me less moved - less a fault in the film than a likely symptom of constant interruptions from my children and my highly medicated state. A stark, brilliant, intelligent film."
" Far too subjective and therefore only worth watching for the old footage (and the correct message to draw from it)
",2020-07-16 00:00:00,6,"This film is a 2016 co-production between the United States and several European countries. I am actually surprised to see Switzerland even involved here. France is probably not a big surprise with ARTE partially in charge. Anyway, this film is mostly in the English language and runs for slightly over 1.5 hours. The writer and director is Haitian filmmaker Raoul Peck and this is perhaps the career-defining effort of his pretty long career so far. Interestingly enough, the next film he made after this one was also a political movie, but had a completely different background because it was a live action movie starring August Diehl as Karl Marx. We talked about that one on another occasion. As for this one here, it was also a bit of a family affair with Raoul's younger brother Hébert being a producer. So I said Peck is the writer and this is only partially true because it is originally based on James Baldwin's incomplete writings about the deaths of his three friends Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King who were all murdered and chronologically in that order I believe. I must say I was not familiar with Evers, but the other two are really big names, have also been portrayed in successful films and Denzel Washington's turn as Malcolm X comes to mind immediately. However, with MLK I wonder if we ever get a truly defining movie. Live action movie, I mean. Okay, as for this one here, like I said in the title of my review I believe that they did not reach a sufficient degree of quality. The old footage was pretty good and pretty haunting though. And not just actual real life footage, but this movie also gives quite a few interesting film recommendations and the scenes we saw there made me curious, especially the classroom scene with the ashamed girl and the two men being fugitives, which is of course a really famous film. Sidney Poitier was included several times here, but interestingly enough we do not see any extracts from his Oscar-winning performance I believe. Poitier is really old now, actually 93 just like Belafonte, another artist you see on several occasions in this documentary and on one occasion the two are even mentioned together, namely when there is a brief mention of how they were sex symbols despite their race, but it was a taboo to see Black men as such. People did not talk about it. I always thought though that Belafonte was a better singer than actor and the fact that we do not see a single film from him here kinda confirms it. However, even if they included some interesting movies, there were also some questionable inclusions, especially towards the end the one with Doris Day. These inclusions had no impact whatsoever. Race is not an issue. There aren't even any Black actors or characters. Very bizarre. Made no sense no matter what despereate explanation they are going to give you. I wish that they could have left out these specific scenes and instead maybe reported from a neutral standpoint on some other characters you see in here. Or groups. With that I am talking about the Black Panther movement that is sadly presented in here. I wish they could have shed light on this group's radical sides as well. They should have. Still back to what I was just talking about: The movie references were still among the better things the film had to offer. In general, when they went back to Baldwin's original idea the film increased in quality, which is why I believe that with better focus and a better adaptation, Baldwin's works offered the potential for a much better documentary. Shame. The outcome is definitely a missed opportunity. This becomes especially obvious in the scene when they connected the interesting mention of the forecast that there will one day be a Black President of the United States of America to a very amateurish-looking montage of random generic scenes of Obama and his wife. Thanks, we already know that it happened. At least make it look good technically if you have to include it. This sequence really felt more as if it was made by student filmmakers.Overall, the film was highly disappointing with its key issue. Example: The White race is reported on almost exclusively in a derogatory manner, but they should have differentiated and seen that it consists of a gigantic amount of human beings, all of them individuals. We see on one occasion a group of young women, also old recordings, just having a fun time in the sun. With this they wanted to show us the female ideal of racists back then and I found it highly disrespectful towards the women shown there in such a context. If they are still alive today or if one of them was my grandmother, it brings a certain kind of unjust(ified) shame on them. There is even a minor reference that these girls could be racists themselves. Implied. No evidence whatsoever. Overall, this film occasionally is in danger of doing the exact thing it criticizes, namely not see people from a certain race as individuals, but categorize them as racists as a whole and blame everybody for those few who actually deserve the blame, even if some of these horrible acts happened decades ago when many weren't even alive. The Kennedys also don't get away unharmed, but that is another story.I also want to say a few words on the very basic components here. The narrator is Samuel L. Jackson and I like him quite a bit. Awesome actor. Makes me a bit sad to see him associated with a shallow film like this that is sending out a questionable message. But he is still brilliant compared to how apparently they cast rapper Samy Deluxe to be the narrator of the German version? What in God's name? No apology for this. Abysmal choice. He is not even an actor and he has a history of substance abuse. As for the narration too, I already mentioned the girls having a fun time earlier, but there was also a crucial flaw that absolutely should not happen with a high-profile film like this, namely when we see them, there is a statement that we all know/knew a Black person in our environment somewhere and when they mentioned the places where we maybe know them from, then they said ""high school"" in the original and the subtitles said something entirely different. I am not completely sure what it was. Household? No, something else I think, but this proves how amateurish some portions of this film were handled. Disgraceful. They should be 100% precise with an important film on such a controversial subject.Of course with the George Floyd situation, the subject in here is also as current as it gets. Or is it really? I say no. And the reason is that in this film you see many occasions of grave racism, sometimes violent ways even, terrible ways, from back in the day and if you compare this to how things are today, there is only one verdict: Times have changed 100%. Racism is not entirely gone, probably never will be, but it's minimal compared to what happened back in the day. Everybody who says that, after all this time (and the filmmakers at least imply this), still nothing has improved is not truthful or not well-informed. We should be proud of how things have developed. But not one bit proud of those who motivate others, perhaps even pay them, to go on the streets and riot, burgle stores, basically use them to push through with their anarchist views without getting their own hands dirty. Now THAT is what I call real racism in the 21st century if we turn people into string puppets, especially if those are at the center of the action and are once again likely to get into danger. Everybody should just live in peace with each other! The film forgets all the improvements.And this is what you should take from this movie. When one single man acts shamefully (racist or not) towards somebody else, then this does not make an entire profession racist. Or homophobic. Or misogynist. If you have nothing in common with this (potentially racist) criminal in a police uniform, don't kneel, but show dignity instead. And most of all, the color of your skin also does not give you any responsibility, guilt or obligation. Treat others like equals. Do better than those who don't. But don't bend down. Don't turn yourself into a victim for no reason. Another thing I want to say: I wish this movie would not only have elaborated on White-on-Black crime, but also on other proportions, percentages and statistics for a more neutral perception. Okay, that is all. Sorry for going a bit OT here and there, but I guess with the context and approach this film takes, it is absolutely necessary to bring in some perspective. One must not remove 90% of truth to support a reality that is included in the remaining 10%. I find it not so cool by the filmmakers that they were trying to do so and also Boo! to the Oscars for nominating this film and the BAFTAs for giving it an award even. Oh yeah, one more thing: The final word from the title, no matter if the five-letter or six-letter version. There is no major elaboration on it in the movie, but I personally do not use it because I know it will always offend people, but then I think nobody should use it and it should not be a privilege to some. Make it a taboo or allow it for everybody, just my opinion. Nobody should carry guilt for what people did or said a 100 years ago.Finally, to still end the review on a positive note, I would like to mention that that discussion group that involved Belafonte, Brando and (especially) Heston looked really interesting. Shame they did not include more extracts from this show. So this is all from me here. I give the overall outcome a thumbs-down and it would have been in my interest if this film had really been more about the indeed tragic and despicable killings of Baldwin's friends instead of turning this film into a clumsy anti-racism statement. Also think it would have been in Baldwin's interest himself. May he/they rest in peace. The film gets a negative recommendation from me. Not recommended. Stay tolerant everybody, all for equality!"
" Outstanding
",2020-07-12 00:00:00,10,What an outstanding work and collective presentation of James Baldwin's views... and some of the related experiences that shaped them. We get to see and touch the very man and translate his words into modern day realities. So many of us can relate.
" Baldwin a Man of His Time with a Message for Now
",2020-07-11 00:00:00,9,"James Baldwin was a force of nature. A man of such high and complex intellect, he would not be surprised, saddened, but not surprised that his predictions about America, a population empty of emotion with a sheer lack of intelligence has come to this terrible point in history. He observed Americans being vapid, stupid and proudly ignorant. The problem has only become worse. We will never heal as a nation, unless we are able to face racism and realize what we, as white people, have created, closing people out for hundreds of years, and change. The use of historical footage past and present adds so much. Samuel L Jackson reads Baldwin's own words and there is plenty of footage of the man. Here's the kicker, Baldwin was no radical. This is free on Netflix."
" complacent or complicit or both
",2020-07-10 00:00:00,9,"This film brings into the sharpest focus you can imagine what white folks can't or won't acknowledge and black folks already know; that we are and have been a racist nation from the very beginning, not an easy film to watch. A scathing indictment of our racist past and present; how so little of significance has really changed. The film shows you what an astute observer James Baldwin was of American history and the American experience. It is Baldwin's own words and his public appearances that make the film so compelling. The script is fine tuned to the extent that it creeps up on you gets right into your soul and shakes it to its core. You can take the title and understand it two ways; I Am not Your Negro; ' you don't own me' and I am not Your Negro ' you don't know me, I am not what you think I am , you don't know anything about what it is like to be black in America.' This is a very powerful film worth every nine stars I gave it and I almost never rate a film Nine stars."
" Engrossing
",2020-07-06 00:00:00,7,"Apropos our times, well directed well told story of how a Blackman feels in the USA."
" If you are white you need to watch this
",2020-06-26 00:00:00,10,"I've created an account to write this review because I found this documentary so moving and informative.I'm white and along with films like Boys in the Hood and Mississippi Burning - this documentary has reminded me that BLM need to matter and hence stay with me.
I know some people have said ""but all lives matter"", well they don't - not in this sense. BLM is so important because black lives have not mattered time and time again. And this documentary demonstrates that, I watched feeling shame at times, but always feeling enlightened.
I too wished I could walk with the black lady to school so that she was not alone, Baldwin comments on his regret at not being there for her too.
There's so many moments to make you pause. And you quite see how some were drawn to the Black Panther movement, and Malcolm X's call to fight by any means necessary (I felt that with Black Panther the movie too! I could see the temptation of the more violent route because of the horrific historical treatment of blacks).
Bobby Kennedy...I wanted to reach into the screen and punch him, Lorraine - oh, inspirational.
That's not even touching on half of the crucial eye opening moments in this.Just watch it."
" I Am Not Your Negro
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,8,"""If any white man in the world says give me liberty or give me death, the entire white world applauds. When a black man says exactly the same thing word for word, he is judged a criminal and treated like one. And everything possible is done to make an example of....... him.""These are the words of writer James Baldwin. Just think Malcolm X or Nelson Mandela.Raoul Peck's documentary expands on Baldwin's unfinished essay of the murders of his activist friends Medgar Evers, Martin Luther King, Jr and Malcolm X. He knew all three of them, he appeared on television with King and Malcolm X as they debated with each other.Baldwin was an erudite writer. He was a long term resident in Paris so he had looked at his homeland from afar. Baldwin then decided to return to the USA and become an observer of the civil rights movement. Baldwin was neither Christian, Muslim or a member of the NAACP. His sexuality might had been a factor in this.This documentary contains his provocative analysis of race, class and American bad faith. Peck splices newsreel images and interviews of Baldwin. It conveys Baldwin's anger because the game is rigged and Baldwin knew this from an early age. You see politicians of the time, liberals such as Robert Kennedy who is not really interested in the plight of blacks in 1960s southern states of America.Baldwin as a youngster would cheer Hollywood cowboys killing the native Indians in the movies. Later realising that the black person was in fact the native Indian. He had been cheering the wrong side.There is a humorous moment when Baldwin's FBI file reveals his probable homosexuality and classifies him as a dangerous individual. Baldwin was openly gay but being quietly passionate and intellectual still saw him as dangerous.The documentary is narrated by Samuel L Jackson in more sombre tones. I did not even realise it was Jackson's voice I was hearing.Baldwin died of cancer in 1987 at a relatively young age of 63. I only became aware of him several months before his death when he was profiled in a news program in Britain. I later learnt that he had tried for years to get a biopic of Malcolm X off the ground. Despite the bleakness contained in this documentary there is also optimism. He did not see white people as the devils.Baldwin's story of Black America is still the story of today's Black America. When a black man dies getting arrested by the police on camera. The debate soon moves to but white lives matter as well."
" Victimizing, Hate filled, and Intelligent
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,7,"This film took me on a roller coaster full of emotion. This film plays the victim card of race relations on both the white and black sides which was disappointing. This is definitely a hate filled propaganda piece against white people as a whole. Personal responsibility is thrown out the window. Fight against the system, but stop blaming the system if you know the system is the problem."
" History isn't in the past it's in the present
",2020-06-11 00:00:00,10,"Unfortunately, this movie is just as relevant today as it was when it was made 4 years ago and as the time it primarily represents. I weeper as I watched it because it forced me to deal with the reality of what America is, really. As difficult as it is to watch please do so. What struck me the most is how America keeps repeating the same mistakes. We must face the reality of America and grieve that reality. Until then we will repeat this yet again"
" Unfortunately Continually Timely
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,8,"It's instructive viewing ""I Am Not Your Negro,"" based on an unfinished manuscript by James Baldwin, a novelist who focused on racial and societal issues during mid-20th-century America, but which compares Baldwin's text and archival footage of him speaking to happenings since his death, including the then-recent events in Ferguson, Missouri, as the documentary continues to prove relevant given the racially-charged protests and unrest erupting from police violence in 2020. Indeed, one of the main touchstones of Baldwin's lecture is the assassinations of civil-rights activists Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.The picture does more than outline the history of racial animosity in the United States and addressing what racism does to both Black and White people, too. Perhaps not surprising given it's a motion picture, the documentary may be at its best when considering the influence of cinema on race in society. Moreover, Baldwin was too intelligent to argue a simplistic tale of progress from Stepin Fetchit to Sidney Poitier, either. ""The Defiant Ones"" (1958) and ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" (1967), for instance, are criticized for their appeal and appeasement to White audiences at the expense of Black ones. On the other hand, we also see how some Hollywood stars actively protested for civil rights while the likes of John Wayne were constructing another narrative of white supremacy on screen.Being an incomplete book, the argument here does have the appearance of a draft at times, with some points, perhaps, not followed through on, or others not seeming quite as relevant, but the addition of the archival footage of Baldwin works well, and Samuel L. Jackson is an effective narrator. To top it off, the reflexive look at movies makes the picture's final montage of returned gazes from African Americans effective. After being lectured on how the history of film has been aimed as comforting to the ideology of the dominant culture, this ending works to undermine that history, as we're no longer ignored to the safety of our gaze upon the screen--unseen and unaccountable. No longer merely a spectator, awakened by the returned gaze, now, we must become a participant."
" Wonderfully presented! Moving, exhilarating...revelatory!
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,10,"This is an elegant effort to describe to all who will listen, how America has failed for over fifty years to ever come to terms with what happens when you degrade a group of humans based on race, gender or religious affiliation. We have failed to pay penitence. ""We should be responsible for our lives. "" this documentary measures up to any Ken Burns accounting of civil war or otherwise. Samuel Jackson's satin voice is a perfect compliment to the words of Mr. Baldwin."
" A must see during the current uprising
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,10,I do not live in the US but I am fascinated by it. I live in the Netherlands where a dutch musician recommended it through social media. Reading James Baldwin's books was already on my to do list and this movie has enticed me even more to dive further in the head of this mastermind. His analysis of the American life is layered and complex but ultimatly comes down to one thing: Are you willing to look at who you really are and are you willing to change to make your society a better place. This movie embodies a universal timeless truth through the mind and creativity of a skillfull genius. A gift to anyone who is open to learn.
" history is not the past, it is the present
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,10,"There is so much to say about this film, too much that i cannot seem to wrap my head around it.the images, the lines, the archival material, everything makes sense, how painful that may be. it has been an honour to see Baldwin talk, to notice his beautiful phrases and his loving and strong personality.His words make this documentary another experience, it allows for admitting of mistakes and failures. it stops denial, he hands us the realisation that this issue does not go beyond us, it defines us.'we carry our past everywhere we go' 'not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced'#blacklivesmatter"
" A story to think about
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,9,"The film, which runs through Baldwin II, Count of Flanders's narrative, uses documentary, film, and graphic material to criticize racism and American culture in a harrowing personal voice. ""history is not the past, it is the present, "" Baldwin II, Count of Flanders said. If we take our history, we are our history. If we don't do this, we are effectively sinners,""he said, criticizing the racists because of their original guilt, their cowardice, their blind blindness, their false illusion of self-isolation, create a terrible nation with no future, no ideals."
" Powerful, Great Movie
",2020-02-18 00:00:00,9,"An emotionally powerful film. Gives insight into the frustrating experiences of being black in America. Some parts were genuinely disheartening.This film paints a bleak picture for the prospects of African Americans during the Civil Rights Era. I can't imagine what James Baldwin must have felt when he saw his three close friends (Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr.) die in quick succession. After finishing this filmI wondered what powerful work of art that ""Remember This House"" would have been if James Baldwin had the chance to finish it. Raoul Peck did a great work piecing together this work of art with the resources and materials he had.4.5/5. Highly recommended."
" Fascinating but a little slow
",2020-01-02 00:00:00,7,Viewing necessary but it's a slow and long narration by Samuel L. Jackson. The film doesn't have much dramatisation or entertaining factors. It's serious and fascinating but a little slow.
" Moving tribute to James Baldwin
",2019-12-13 00:00:00,10,"And in his own words. Magnificent. Wonderful documentary. If you don't cry during this film, your tear ducts aren't functioning."
" A remarkable film
",2019-11-17 00:00:00,10,"I grew up in the UK and entered my teen years at the time this film focuses on and the US politics of civil rights formed a significant part of the process of my political socialisation. This film is a powerful reminder to me of just why the US civil rights movement made such an impact on me (and on so many others).In addition to powerful film footage, the documentary (which is what it really is) draws on interviews with the key political actors in and around the movement,to illuminate their positions and their assassinations. There are occasional cutaways to contemporary events which remind us that bigotry and irrational prejudice-based hatred continue to lie just beneath the surface of America.The film also draws on Baldwin's precise and beautifully constructed prose (which loses none of its power for that precision and beauty) reminding us of just how poor our contemporary leaders are.The message of the film? Simple. The US is a violent society that was built on violence and nothing short of a revolution will change it."
" Very important figure but boring watch
",2019-11-14 00:00:00,3,The struggle of this man was immense. A shame the media didn't support the weight of the story or the strong character.
" Possession/development/depiction
",2019-09-25 00:00:00,8,"It's quite interesting to see how colored/African Americans were depicted in movies. It mirrors the standing in the society at times. Not always the best picture (no pun intended). If you are able to sit back and take a different perspective and try to see things from another angle, it is quite eye opening.And it always helps to have Samuel L. Jackson as narrator. That man can talk and if he does, you better listen. But it is rich in history, in context in showing many things that were wrong and are still wrong in America. Still this is a general look and may not include an in depth look into an issue you may want to explore. I would say the ending is hopeful, but it is not just everything is good now ... no, it actively tells us that we have to do better. And we can! I believe in that"
" Best Movie
",2019-06-09 00:00:00,9,"This documentary tells the true story of America and heads up white people we are the villain. The history that this film contrasts with the present is very evocative, hard hitting, and exactly we have history books. James Baldwin's words have always been a breathe of fresh air so I would recommend you watch this movie, listen to his words and his experience and take a deep breathe of fresh air."
" Required American Viewing
",2019-05-02 00:00:00,9,"I cannot think of a more unique yet purposeful and cogent way to tell the story of the Civil Rights Movement in 90 minutes. Baldwin makes his case with more power in a few words than many people make with their entire lives. The way he articulates the difference between outright hatred and willing ignorance was personally convicting, and his point illustrating a black man saying ""give me liberty or give me death"" is just...damn."
" A brilliant movie about a brilliant man
",2019-01-07 00:00:00,10,"This film should be required viewing for every citizen of the United States. Until we can bridge the gap of our own ignorance, we will continue to have race issues in this country. That we still have so far to go, 30+ years after Mr. Baldwin's death, is a sad commentary on our unwillingness to face our fears and grow."
" Intelligent analysis by writer James Baldwin about the ignorance of the masses towards racism in the sixties
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,8,"Very intelligent analysis about the reasons of persistence of racism in America. According to writer activist James Baldwin the most profound reason why racism was ever present in the sixties, was because of the passiveness and ignorance of the white masses. What one isnt aware of, one cant change. This is hard to imagine for anyone who has ever fallen victim to racism, but for the happy go lucky masses of white people who were born, fed and prospered in a world during the sixties, where being white equaled enjoying superior privileges and enhanced chances for prosperity, racism was non existent. According to James Baldwin those white masses simply had no consciousness of racism as being a serious problem whatsoever. See no evil, hear no evil, then there surely can not be any evil amongst the white people...As is pointed out in this documentary, the american slave trade from Africa was hugely profitable for the cotton industry. Without those very profitable slave wages America's (slave driven) economy from 1800 and onward wouldnt have become as wealthy and powerful as it is to this very day. Although this ""slave for profit"" theme is only mentioned briefly a few times, this director made several other documentaries and movies about the effects of a profit driven market economy on segregation in Haiti, the director's homeland country."
" A lesson in history
",2018-09-23 00:00:00,9,Only when we become humble enough to accept criticism for the rampant abuse whites have perpetuated throughout history will we truly evolve as a society. Watch this movie!
" If you want to ban racism, this won't help!

" USA racism in the spotlight
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,8,Great time capsule of James Baldwin who went to Paris to heal his bruised psyche by the USA. He was a writer and argued with passion about the trouble with his co-citizens. The WASP invader still hangs on today.
" Baldwin's intelligence is a highlight
",2018-02-19 00:00:00,7,"James Baldwin and his views of racism in the U.S. are the main focus of this documentary with special attention on the assassinations of Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King. The film includes live footage of Baldwin in the 1960s (on the Dick Cavett Show and at a lecture at Cambridge University) and readings (voiced by Samuel L. Jackson) from his unfinished manuscript ""Remember this House"".From the start, it is clear that Baldwin had an intellect and outlook that were far superior to the average person - not just during his life (he died in 1987) but even more so today. He is very eloquent in expressing the repugnance of an evil whose effects continue to resonate today. He is even more so when he describes theories that racism is a result of a deeper problem in the soul and collective mindset of the U.S. One such malaise is the quest for an unattainable ideal of ""purity"" and the inevitable self-loathing that follows this self-delusional pursuit. Other such problems include materialism.Baldwin's mind is so much above that of the average viewer that there is a slightly mixed result. At times, one feels distant - and possibly inferior - to the mindset being expressed but overall, the viewer is rewarded with insight that is rare in other sources.Considering the rich history of this film, it is disappointing that some information was excluded. Baldwin had two prejudices against him. In addition to being black, he was also gay. This fact is alluded to only briefly during the film. There are also surprising negative comments he made against Bobby Kennedy. Research after the film revealed that Baldwin and Kennedy did not get along despite supporting a similar cause. The film might have been more rewarding had it explored more on both of these topics.The footage is brilliant and shocking at the same time. After this movie, one is left with many uncomfortable feelings that lead to a lot of thinking - a sign it has fulfilled its purpose. - dbamateurcritic"
" Why Sam Jackson?
",2018-01-16 00:00:00,7,"This is an essential documentary at the right time, introducing the great writer and cultural activist, who had fallen into semi-obscurity, to many new minds. The footage of James Baldwin's public speaking is riveting and as timely as can be. Hopefully it will send many fans of this highly-acclaimed documentary to his brilliantnovels, plays, and essays. The big problem I had with the movie is the choice of Samuel Jackson as narrator, speaking Baldwin's words in a croaky, raspy voice that was as far from Baldwin's precise diction as can be imagined. Maybe that was the point, but it grated on me every time I heard it."
" Maybe the most innovative and beautiful documentary I have ever seen
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,10,"Baldwin did not just write about ""race"" - he wrote about morality and humanity. Similarly, this documentary is not just about Baldwin - it is about society and justice and so much more. No talking heads this time. Just the words of a gifted thinker/writer, images from every corner of this nation, and one of the most beautiful/powerful documentaries I have ever seen. This is documentary as art form. Must. See."
" of a time and timeless
",2017-10-01 00:00:00,7,"James Baldwin is a black social justice writer who passed away in 1987. Director Raoul Peck takes one of his final unfinished projects and creates a documentary about his ideas about race in America. It uses his interviews and material from the epic late 60's. It is of a time, a view, and a personal experience. The most compelling is a section where Bobby Kennedy predicts a black president some 40 years in the future and Baldwin dismaying the dismissive nature of the prediction. It's cut with Obama and we're left with wondering about Baldwin's perception. In many ways, he is of a time of his existence. So much of it is out of date but in the time of Trump, so much of it is present today. I admit that I don't know much about Baldwin. He's a lesser known name today than icons like Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King, Jr. This is a message in a bottle and it's fascinating to see how things have changed but somethings never change."
" Black as day
",2017-08-27 00:00:00,3,"First of, you have to hand it to Samuel Jackson. He could make my tax statement sound captivating. Next, director Raoul Peck manages to back him up with a stunning visual collage of archive footage.So ""I Am Not Your Negro"" is a surprisingly easy watch, despite the fact that it is based on an unfinished script by James Baldwin So why is this movie called ""I Am Not Your Negro""? I don't know. And in any case, I don't want ""you"" to be my negro. Baldwin's text is called, equally obliquely, but less catchily, ""Remember This House"".What I got from this movie was that James Baldwin was a trained preacher, who tried to be an acolyte to far more charismatic civil rights activists (in the case case of Malcolm X, black racist) Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr., who were murdered before they were 40 years old (and in Malcolm's case, by black henchmen of his own cult). The film has to pussyfoot around the fact that two other protagonists of the era, the Kennedy brothers, were also murdered, despite the fact that they were not downtrodden and as white as the cliffs of Dover.Baldwin is seen trying to convince liberal white Americans, who were all for civil rights in the first place, that fighting racism was somehow not an act of altruism but somehow would contribute to their own betterment.And also that the white sheriff in ""In The Heat Of The Night"" and ""Mr. Tibbs"" have an erotic tension going on between them."
" A White interpretation of a VERY GOOD DOCUMENTARY
",2017-08-04 00:00:00,8,"Firstly, Sam Jackson; WOW I didn't even recognize your voice-over work.As a child NOT living in the US during this horrible historic times, I was saddened and shocked with some of the realities that many beautiful innocent African Americans were force to face.I didn't know James Baldwin going into this viewing, but WOW, what a great orator, thinking and philosopher. His analysis and opinions should be standard reading. Partly because of his 'message' but mostly because he deserve the attention and respect of ALL peoples. His message is both historic, and current. I am sure a subjugate individual in any situation could substitute their current condition into Mr.Baldwins ideas...So, as I said I am not African American, and in fact didn't grow up in the US. In my country, we just weren't raised seeing color. And so when I watch/listen so such eloquent, beautiful and powerful commentary that doesn't stir a ""one side or the other side"" emotion, I end up just being ""emotional"", because of the content spoken, not ties to one side or the other.I would really recommend that other White people watch this document. Not because of White-guilt, as I don't believe I have done anything wrong... But I do BELIEVE that I needed to LEARN the REAL truth as it relates to historical relations with African American community.My HEART bleeds and PRAYS that the US has moved slightly forward. Barack Obama HAS TO REPRESENT at least slight progress.I do agree with a previous Reviewer that complete and utter lack of ANY sort of positivity or hope. (or at least I missed it).But again... James Baldwin is truly an American Hero in my mind.All my heart hopes things work out better over the next 5-10-15-20-25 yrs."
" Best documentary I've seen in a long time
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,9,"A documentary that adapts James Baldwin's unfinished book 'Remember This House' recounting the lives and assassinations of Martin Luther King Jnr., Malcolm X and Medgar Evers. Not much to say other than this one of the best documentaries I've seen in a long time. Powerful material delivered like a story with the aid of archival footage, photographs, newsreels, Hollywood film clips, debates from the civil right era all to suggest Baldwin's writings. Nominated for the Best Documentary Academy Award, 'I Am Not Your Negro' is a rare cinematic achievement about an issue that is still so relevant today. You can't take your eyes off it nor your mind."
" An Eloquent and Angry Examination of the Racial Divide
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,9,"James Baldwin began a book called ""Remember This House"" but died before completing it. It intended to weave together the stories of Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, and Medgar Evers into a tapestry of the black American experience. In ""I Am Not Your Negro,"" Samuel L. Jackson reads the finished portion of the manuscript, and filmmaker Raoul Peck sets the words to images from the Civil Rights Movement and the current Black Lives Matter movement. The result is a bracing and deservedly angry film that captures better than anything I've read or seen yet the reasons behind the frustration and outrage of American blacks.There's a marvelous moment in the film when a philosophy professor challenges Baldwin on the Dick Cavett Show for his attitudes, and basically holds Baldwin (and by extension black people) responsible for the continuing racial divide. His message seems to be ""you're the one making an issue out of this, not me."" Baldwin's take down of him in eloquent words that I won't even begin to try to replicate captures the essence of the entire film and the black struggle for equality. And Baldwin's criticism doesn't stop at racial issues. He also denounces American popular and material culture in general, accusing Americans of letting consumerism anesthetize them into a false sense of happiness and contentment that allows them to ignore all that is wrong with the American way of life.This is a movie that made me furious at America for continuing to stick its head up its ass when it comes to the subject of race. Watching Baldwin's heartfelt distress over the Civil Rights Movement juxtaposed to recent images from the news made it crystal clear that America has not progressed as much as it would like to think it has. Grade: A"
" The poignant and cogent documentary is realistically scathing the contemporary and prevalent disenfranchisement of African-Americans.
",2017-06-26 00:00:00,9,"The nominee for the best documentary feature at the 89th academy awards, I Am Not Your Negro is already considered a cinematic spectacle in its own essence by a variety of critics. The poignant and cogent documentary is realistically scathing the contemporary and prevalent disenfranchisement of African-Americans with a retrospective narration of civil rights era's horrendous and dehumanizing conditions that prevailed less than a generation ago.The principle figure in the documentary is the celebrated African- American essaying and novelist James Baldwin (1924-1987). It is based on his unfinished manuscript of the novel Remember This House in which he documented his personal views on the civil right movement, the precarious conditions of African-Americans and his engagements with civil rights activists like Medgar Evers(1925- 1963), Malcolm X(1925-1965) and Martin Luther King Jr (1929-1968) who were all assassinated for their stance and activism on equality, civil liberty and the emancipation of African-Americans from a system that oriented its legitimacy and policies on slavery and Jim crow heritage.The documentary director is the Haitian filmmaker Raoul Peck. We remember him from his existentially nuanced works, like the documentary Lumumba (2000) which is about the Congolese freedom fighter and first prime minister of independent Congo Patrice Lumumba(1925-1961) who also demised at the hands of US and Belgium intelligence operatives. It is narrated by Samuel L. Jackson with a sonorous voice that arrests the viewers attention and initiates an irresistible compassionate empathy for the 'lived experiences' of African-Americans. Raoul Peck draws much of the narrated script from letters and notes written by James Baldwin during the 1960s and 1970s and wove video clips melodiously with them, and the result is a sublime and original documentary film .I Am Not Your Negro, is a necessary intervention at a time when the global world is marred by racism, xenophobia and a deleterious identity politics. The resurgence of nationalism based on negativism (Brexit) and the mushrooming of the likes of Donald Trump and 'strongmen' across Europe discloses howhumanity failed to transcend an excruciating 'modern' racism and the failure of 'project Humanity' – multiculturalism, Tolerance and plurality. The documentary exposes the facile in modernity's claimed progress when it comes to issues of race and 'humanity' of black people in general.Raoul Peck, reminds us of this gawking reality that the conditions of African-Americans has not changed at all – think of the Black Lives Matter and Baltimore uprisings. It is hard to avowedly enunciate the difference between what James Baldwin and his ilk faced and the contemporary challenges faced by African-Americans and Black people across the world. We exist in a continued adversary and detrimental conditions - in terms of economic, psychology and identity - that our parents experienced not so long ago. The issues James Baldwin begrudged and grappled with is what this millennial generation articulates and ventures to 'face and solve' with all its intricacies. Hamid Dabashi, the Iranian philosopher praised Raoul Peck metaphorically in a recent Aljazeera article that he '' has poured Baldwin's beautifully aging wine in a masterfully crafted new bottle''.This year we have witnessed and exulted at the monumental towering of films by Black actors and directors with Moonlight, Fences and The Birth of A Nation taking center stage in cinema. The subject of their themes has been peculiar to African-American lives and its historiography as it meandered through the turbulent waves of the American dream. James Baldwin emphatically comprehended and discerned the African-American pariah figure and her conditions throughout his oeuvres and director Raoul Peck clothed it with a superficial cinematic poignancy and authenticity. I Am Not Your Negro lacks any blemish and I posit confidently that it's the documentary-film of this year 2017. Highly recommended for all."
" Not bad
",2017-06-22 00:00:00,7,"Greetings from Lithuania.As the one who doesn't live in America and has nothing to do with the events shown here, i can only say that i did enjoyed this documentary ""I Am Not Your Negro"" (2016). There were some truly important and hardly seen documentary videos about the past in the USA, some footage showing well known people. ""I Am Not Your Negro"" is narrated by Samuel L. Jackson who uses his voice to tell words of James Baldwin - an activist of which i have never heard before. It also mainly focuses about his thoughts and relationships with Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr and Medgar Evers. His thoughts were insightful and interesting to hear.Overall, is a well made and important documentary, but it didn't involved me as much as i kinda expected it to have. All in all this is a definitely a not bad documentary to see it once."
" Impressive documentary
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,6,"The form Raoul Peck has chosen for this documentary is quite original. It consists of two elements: the words of author James Baldwin about the black struggle in the US, read aloud by Samuel L. Jackson, and archive footage and images depicting the way the US has treated race relations in the last century.The effect of the combination is powerful. Everyone knows how Afro-Americans have been treated and are still treated in the US, but seeing all the violence, the hatred and the discrimination concentrated in a 90-minute succession of images, remains shocking. The words of Baldwin are, in a way, a contrast. He is a civilized voice in an uncivilized society. In the archive footage of his speeches and interviews, he is always calm and composed, eloquent and sophisticated.Baldwin's book is about three murdered activists: Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King. The film doesn't explain their ideologies and differences in depth, it lets the images speak for themselves. A very interesting aspect of the film is the way Baldwin analyzes some well-known films of that era.But the strongest moments of the film are not the scenes of black struggle, but the images showing how America saw itself. The promotion films about the scenery and the recreational possibilities of the country, the photographs of happy, smiling and prosperous families, and the films with Doris Day and Gary Cooper. What Baldwin and Peck show, is how little consideration this white, rich, middle-class America gave to the plight of the black community.Although the subject of the film is extremely interesting and important, the combination of literature with images requires a lot from the viewer. It takes much energy to focus on the words and on the images at the same time. And after a while, when the novelty wears off and the message has been delivered, I had more difficulty to keep concentrated. At the same time, Peck has made an impressive movie."
" nope
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,10,"A brilliant cine-essay that uses James Baldwin's electrifying prose as a launch pad for a critique of Hollywood cinema-as-embodiment-of-the- American-ego. The ego, in Freudian terms, is the mask of the unconscious, but one can trace the true nature of that unconscious by examining the ego, as one can map a face by feeling its contours through a mask. The N----- is, the film argues, the foundational character of the story Amerika tells itself about itself. For the N is the castrated other, the desexualized one that assures the viewer they have Power. Does not this imaginary embodiment of castration point to the puritanical impotence of the self? Is the most violent empire in history, which elected the likes of Donald Trump as its representative, not built by and for the needs of cowards?"
" The white picket fence
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,7,"I gave this documentary a slightly higher score than it might otherwise have because of it's timing. Perhaps it would be good at anytime, but it has an added poignancy because the message of American self destruction (there is even a little Trump excerpt) is the also the story that James Baldwin tells with the notes from his unprinted history of civil rights.Within the pantheon of the black movement, Baldwin was not similar to either Malcolm X or Martin Luther King; he was a transgressive wordsmith - not a fighter or a stoic example. But he is the perfect foil for this documentary that melds the 60s with today, as he understood that racial hate was a self hate that cannot easily be quenched. His important point is that American white society cannot square it's myths and dreams with reality. Samuel Jackson's narration adds to this solidly put together documentary that keeps the viewer engaged all the way.This film has a slight family superficiality sometimes, with little depth attempted with the lives of the black heroes who already have several films dedicated to them. A good knowledge of the time line is assumed, as the film jumps up and down it regularly.Many images, old and new are (still) shocking - though Baldwins diagnosis remains the bitter pill that America cannot swallow."
" Came with high expectations but was disappointed
",2017-03-21 00:00:00,6,"I'm not your Negro"" directed by Haitian Raoul Peck, is based on the unfinished writing of James Baldwin on the lives and deaths of three prominent figures of the Civil Rights Movement of the sixties, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, and Medgar Evers, all, three of whom were assassinated before the reached the age of forty. Before the main title we see a clip of Baldwin on the Dick Cavett talk show, which will be reprised several,times during the film. Baldwin is himself the person most seen throughout, the star of the film, so to speak -- but others include Malcolm X, Luther King and Evers, plus Robert Kennedy who was also assassinated within the same time frame, and, of course, Sidney Poitier and Harry Belafonte. A long sequence from Stanley Kramer's ""The Defiant Ones"" shows Tony Curtis and Poitier on the lam but bound together by prison chains, forced to cooperate in order to survive even though they hate each other -- the best clip in Peck's film. Many other clips were I thought far less irrelevant to director Peck's intended massaging -- basically, it seems, intended to make white viewers feel guilty. We see Baldwin addressing an enthusiastic crowd at Cambridge in England and a number of other similar scenes spaced out throughout the picture as he becomes an international celebrity. There is much graphic footage of violent police brutality against black demonstrators with Baldwin's commentary heard over --and hateful white demonstrations against ""niggers"" right up to the present day -- Ferguson, etc., but randomly interspersed. The overall tone of the film is quite bleak delivering the message that it is up to white America to change their indifferent attitude on race relations if they are ever to improve to the point where negroes are totally accepted and integrated fully into the society, while not holding out much hope that this will ever be achieved. The only slight ray of Hope is a flash of Black president Obama and his wife, after we see Baldwin wryly saying that, within another forty years a black man might become president ""If we behave ourselves"" -- oddly enough it was just exactly forty years later that Obama was elected. Peck makes extensive use of film clips from Hollywood movies (Dori Day, etc.) meant to demonstrate the complacency of White America and their lack of concern for the plight of black people. John Wayne is shown in an extended clip from Stagecoach shooting down Indians right and left. References to the Wounded Knee massacre and other atrocities against native Americans are used to imply that the Negroes who were raised as children to root for John Wayne are actually victims just like the Indians and should have been identifying with the Indians not the cowboys. The picture is divided into sections with chapter like headings on a Horizontally split black and white screen as a visual metaphor for the black white racial divide. In between poetic visual sequences not really related to the main line of the narration are inserted for some kind of effect which I found pointless and distracting filler. J. Edgar Hoover, notorious head of the FBI puts Baldwin on a dangerous persons list to be watched and underlines his homosexuality because of his outspoken anti-Racism. However, Baldwin was not nearly as radical as some of his contemporaries. He disavows the Black Panthers on the grounds that their ideology which demonizes all white people, is simply untrue. Not all white people are devils. He also refuses to identify with the NAACP movement on the grounds that it tends to promote divisive class distinctions in the black community. in sum, Baldwin was an independent thinker whose thought never strayed from demanding that the white community as a whole must take responsibility for their racism and deal with it honestly on their own. He lived most if his adult life as an ex-pat in France. While this film gives a detailed summary of racism and anti-racism in the sixties my feeling was that it is rather heavy handed and incoherent in a way that Baldwin himself might not have been very happy with. Moreover, rather than make me feel a sense of responsibility as a white person, it mainly served to make me realize how basically alien American black culture is to me. All in all I was disappointed in the film although I came to it with very high expectations. At the five PM screening at the Music Hall cinema in Beverly Hills there were only five viewers besides myself. The film is not packing them in. Seems to me Europeans are more interested in American race relations than well off white Americans. It was far better attended and positively reviewed at the Berlin film festival."
" A powerful highlight reel of institutional racism
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,9,"A documentary of searing intensity, I Am Not Your Negro is based on an unfinished manuscript by author James Baldwin (Go Tell it on the Mountain, The Fire Next Time) who details his reminiscences of and friendships with civil rights leaders Medgar Evers, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Malcolm X, whose betrayal and murder he lived to witness. Narrated from the unfinished manuscript by Samuel L. Jackson using an authoritative modulated voice that matches Baldwin's speaking style, Peck's film is more than a retrospective of three civil rights leaders but a persuasive, intuitive case for Baldwin as a poet and prophet.Weaving in old speeches and writings from other books, the film provides an emotional look at the stain of racism in American history through the eyes of a man of impeccable eloquence and depth. Though he was an outspoken critic of American culture, the irony is that he was the only black spokesman that white America could relate to. Peck includes sequences showing the excessive force used by police officers in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014, photos of Tamir Rice and Trayvon Martin, civil rights protests marches from the 1960s, White-power rallies, and the assassination of Martin Luther King.It is a powerful highlight reel of institutional racism punctuated by Baldwin's acerbic rhetoric, only somewhat mitigated by Bobby Kennedy's speech on King's murder and his prediction that we will have a black president within the next 40 years. Being gay at a time when it was considered as a sickness, Baldwin was always an outsider but it was a vantage point that enabled him to look at American society with blistering detachment. ""And what has happened,"" he said, ""is as though I, having always been outside it—more outside it than victimized by it, but mainly outside it—can see it better than you can see it."" In his provocative TV interviews such as those on the Dick Cavett show, Baldwin pulls no punches in articulating his outrage at the hypocrisy of Western democracies, singling out Hollywood movies such as Love in the Afternoon and Lover Come Back and stars Gary Cooper and Doris day as being examples of our collective fantasies and their ""grotesque appeals to innocence."" Reflecting on his childhood, Baldwin recounts how he realized how ""This country has not in its whole system of reality evolved any place for you,"" and that rooting for the cowboys to kill the Indians, was in fact cheering for the oppressors against himself.Wearily resigned about the Negro's chance for equality in a white-dominated society, Baldwin's outrage often comes across as bitterness and despair yet his message does not feel outdated. He said, ""Your history has led you to this moment, and you can only begin to change yourself by looking at what you are doing in the name of your history, in the name of your gods, in the name of your language."" His words are even more relevant in today's bitterly divided America in which the fire may not wait for the next time."
" James Baldwin's insights into US racism remain cogent today.
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,9,"The key line is Baldwin's ""History is not about the past. It's about the present. We carry our history.""This combination of Samuel Jackson reading Baldwin's unfinished narrative about three black American martyrs with documentary footage of the times zaps to the heart of the current tragedy of America. What Baldwin perceived in 1960s America continues in spades today. He describes America's two founding races as two blocs ignorant of each other, unable to speak to or to understand each other, locked in a mutual fear — portending war. That summarizes our current warring snarl of Republicans and Non-Republicans, the Trumps and their threatened opposition. Here is one of Baldwin's key perceptions: ""What white people have to do, is try and find out in their own hearts why it was necessary to have a (n-word)in the first place. Because I'm not a (n-word); I'm a man. But if you think I'm a (n-word), it means you need it."" That is, why do Americans need to conjure an enemy within?In post-Obama neo-racist America, that remains the crux. Add one refinement. The paranoid murderous oppressive class is the same. But add the Latino, Muslim and ever-reliable scapegoat Jew to the Negro as the monster of the white man's imagination. Baldwin looked beyond race for the crux of America's continuing nightmare. He saw mainstream America as pursuing an unsatisfying set of values. Consumerism, materialism and deluded pretences to freedom and democracy have failed to provide the profound contentment and self-acceptance they crave. Feeling victimized, insecure, empty, they seek out an enemy among themselves on whom to blame the inadequacy of their lives. The film is as shocking and terrifying as any horror. The1950s savagery that we thought we had outgrown is back. Trump's looming voucher system for schools will revive the vampire segregation, to perpetuate the underclass's disadvantages. The economy, the climate, the water, national health and safety will all be sacrificed to increase the white power's profits. The fear and hatred of the Other, whether in hue or national origin, has already been trickling down from Trump's diatribes to the playgrounds and besieged borders, synagogues and mosques. And here is the most frightening point. All this destruction, all this inhumanity to man, is facilitated if not actually initiated and inflicted by America's institutions of government. To see the Republican congressmen smiling and nodding at Trump's empty anodynes and lies in his State of the Union address is to realize how the government majority in both houses supports and advances his prejudice and hatred. We still have an attorney general who was disqualified from lower justice appointments because of his racism — and has since been exposed as a perjurer to boot. The oppressive government holds as strangling a grip on America's persecuted citizens now as it had in Jim Crow. Worse still: even had everyone in America watched this film the Electoral College's final verdict would have been the same. Trump's so-called presidency is the symptom of a national disease — eloquently diagnosed by the prescient as well as perceptive James Baldwin."
" Very educational, and involving.
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,9,"'I AM NOT YOUR NEGRO': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A critically acclaimed documentary, based on James Baldwin's unfinished manuscript 'Remember This House'. The film takes a very detailed, and thought provoking look at race relations throughout America's history. It's narrated by Samuel L. Jackson, and it was directed and co- scripted by Raoul Peck. The movie has received nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics, and it was nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the 2017 Academy Awards. I found it to be a very powerful, and quite moving film. Samuel L. Jackson narrates the thoughts of James Baldwin, using excerpts from his manuscript, as he reminisces on his views on racism (throughout recent history). Video and pictures accompany the narration, and fittingly powerful music as well. The movie also focuses on civil right leaders Medgar Evers, Malcom X and Martin Luther King, Jr. (through Baldwin's views on them). There's also a great deal of video of Baldwin himself.The film is very educational, and involving. It's the type of movie that I think should be shown in all high school history classes; it's that good! It teaches the viewer a lot about history, while focusing on the negative race relations (that have been persistent throughout it). I think the film is especially educational for anyone that doesn't really understand what racism is, or how it really works, this is a very important film for those people to see (and they're definitely abundant).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ZNHDah5M"
" Worthwhile, but misses the mark
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,5,"James Baldwin said of actress Sylvia Sidney: ""Sylvia Sidney was the only film actress who reminded me of a colored girl, or woman - which is to say that she was the only American film actress who reminded me of reality. ... I always believed in her."" Baldwin was an aficionado of classic film, and director Peck uses vintage footage to reflect this. Peck stated that he had a ""great team of archivists"" locating footage that would underscore Baldwin's commentary on film and film players. So, where is Sylvia Sidney? Her omission is an unfortunate oversight. Most appalling is the use of Doris Day's image juxtaposed against the lynching of a black woman. As if Day were responsible for such atrocities. While Baldwin claimed that Day and Gary Cooper were ""two of the most grotesque appeals to innocence the word has ever seen"" -- was he aware that Day's father had married a black woman? Was he aware that Day had an affair with African-American baseball player Maury Wills? Was he aware that Day had starred in one of the first anti-KKK films (Storm Warning) in 1951? For Peck to insert the image of Doris Day in such an undeserving spot, in an otherwise absorbing film, does great injustice to her. It would have better suited the purpose of I Am Not Your Negro, to include Baldwin's commentary on Ms. Sidney, and feature a clip of her in Street Scene, or Dead End .... where she reigned as cinema's Depression Heroine."
" one voice
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,9,"As I left the cinema with my companion Ana Marton, she turned to me and said: It's a labour of love! And I immediately understood what she was right because if there is one thing that stands out in Raoul Peck's 'I Am Not Your Negro , it is that there is love at the heart of his film. 'I Am Not Your Negro' feels like the film of a director who has read and reread James Baldwin many times, each time absorbing him the more deeply into his blood. Reaching the point, from all considerations, where a film, not made about but with Baldwin, was possible. A film in which not everything could be said, but in which much that was essential in the writer could be uttered.Viewing 'I Am Not Your Negro' it feels like Raoul Peck (RP) has consciously minimised his own presence, almost disappeared from the film. Because this is Baldwin's film. And RP knows he has made Baldwin's film and no one should take the credit for Baldwin's film but Baldwin. His is the voice. Of course 'I Am Not Your Negro' is a finely crafted film and in that respect it is Peck's seamless fusion of Baldwin's strong voice and the film material that almost renders his own presence invisible. RP writes himself out of the script allowing him to refine his task so as to actualise the life and writing of the poet and writer who has inspired and shaped the lives of those many born without the protective carapace of white skin. Raoul Peck's intention in the film is to give total primacy to the writing. Nothing is more important. Baldwin's writing commands the screen, allowing his voice to ring clearly across the years since his death in 1987. Releasing Baldwin's words so that they might resonate today with acuity intelligence and insight into the heart of present day America. An America that in Baldwin's terms is still a sick troubled society. Baldwin's predictions bear witness today to the primacy of Donald Trump; perhaps a sicker more troubled culture now than in the 1960's and 1970's epitomised in the continuing fate of its black population to be looked upon as a despised degenerate slave people. A fate made more urgent and cogent by the fact that the political discourse about 'blacks' is spoken in a euphemistic code of political correctness that overlays the deeply buried prejudice and discrimination. Peck's script is largely based on Baldwin's 1975 work, 'No name in the street'. This is sometimes described as a group of essays. It is not. It is rather an autobiographical work that is structured in the manner of a stream of consciousness. It intermixes the personal memory, reflection and analysis of white culture and society, and interpolates into the text the significance and deaths of the the three great black American resistance figures of the 20th century, with all of whom, Baldwin had worked and fought. Medgar Evans, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King. Baldwin's utterance, voiced by the deep sonorous bass of Samuel Jackson, is the dominant affect in the movie, Baldwin's writing is the truth content, energising and organising the visual material, the affect that points to the significance of the visual imagery. What we see is images that are an extension of the voice's perception: images drawn from originary material of Baldwin himself such as his 1965 Cambridge debate; archive material of King Evans and Malcolm X; and movie clips from popular Hollywood film that range from the 1920's to the 1970's. In addition RP makes some use of present day coverage of race riots in Milwaukie and Ferguson to extend the scope of Baldwin's vision into the present day, and to give the lie to the endless stream of white faces appearing on televisions to tell the black people that they are: ""Sorry!"". Sorry for what?And: 'I Am Not Your Negro' did not win a 2017 Oscar. No surprise. The boys and girls in the Hollywood back rooms were never going to give the gong to James Baldwin. I mean you have to take the film's title seriously. Baldwin's idea was to tell truth, his truth: not to entertain. Thanks RP. adrin neatrour adrinuk@yahoo.co.uk"
" Necessary
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,10,"I believe the words and thoughts of Baldwin are necessary for the progression of our nation. Despite the historical period of which he wrote this documentary, the conditions of our nation are still virtually the same. Although it may be hard to watch, and hard to admit, this film is a must watch."
" Fantastic Movie
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,10,This movie is beyond words. It hits on every important event of that time period and gives relative information that can help with issues and events minorities are dealing with today. This is my first time leaving a review and I had to do it when I saw the low ratings for this movie. This movie is worth the time and money and should not have any low ratings.
" ""The story of the negro in America is the story of America. It is not a pretty story.""
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,10,"I Am Not Your Negro feels monumental. It's not simply subject matter; just because a film looks at the black experience in America it doesn't necessarily mean it is a great artistic feat (if that were true, then something like Hidden Figures, which is a good but still 'feel good' kind of watered-down Hollywood product, would be in my top 10 this year, and it isn't). There has to be something else to the artistry, to elevate the subject matter and to make us feel, somehow, that through art there can be some redemption. This is significant with a film like this because there is little/nothing that can be found as redemptive in what white people have done to blacks over hundreds of years. While James Baldwin grew up at a time when he was free inasmuch that he wasn't a slave or someone's direct property, the struggle for African Americans to have some kind of semblance not even so much to have civil right but to be *acknowledged as human beings*, to be MEN and WOMEN, was one that he sought and argued for his whole life.Peck depicts Baldwin's life and times through his words, spoken by Samuel L Jackson in a performance that you can forget easily is a performance because of how masterfully he slips into *being* Baldwin. It may not be a performance at all, it's simply like we are hearing this man reading from his (at the time of his death unfinished) book about the lives and deaths of Medgar Evers, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X as he knew thing (which, I should add, makes it all the more remarkable, hopefully when his career is evaluated in sum this will be one of Jackson's major accomplishments). But Peck also depicts it through the art of juxtaposition - and make no mistake, art is what goes into this process, whether Peck is choosing scenes from films (both famous ones like Guess Who's Coming to Dinner and The Defiant Ones, which Baldwin had some strong and pointed criticisms of, or clips from educational films and newsreels and of course blacks being abused and beaten in the streets and/or marching), or whether it's Baldwin himself, or someone else.The art comes in the way that Baldwin's words create a context about how society has treated black people, and how, with as clear a sense of purpose as possible, Baldwin wants to strip down further how whites see blacks and even how blacks see whites and blacks see blacks and everything else that goes with that. Some of the juxtaposition is simple enough - John Wayne, who Baldwin describes as someone who ""never grew up,"" is shown slaughtering Indians in 'fun', which Baldwin then uses to bring in the black experience as something comparable, which it is - while others are rebukes, denunciations, and, philosophically and emotionally, seeing how images portrayed by society intersect and contradict and make even more painful how blacks were treated and still are for so long: that fear and rage and hurt, while whites create their own context. And lastly the juxtaposing comes in with modern times (Obama, the murders of Tamir Rice and Michael Brown in Ferguson, all those white politician apologies, with the last one of course being Trump, that superimposed over a montage of a road slowly going along).If anything the movie is inspiring simply because it sees with the clearest of vision not that things have changed so much but that things have not changed, and that even with the end of segregation or voting rights or whatever, the soul of America is forever stuck in a place where things can never fully be healed (in a moment that seems darkly prophetic and provocative, in 1965 Baldwin calls out RFK for saying that one day there could be a black president as something that feels/seems/maybe is like whites *allow* blacks to become presidents, and it only takes 40 years after 400 years of slavery and oppression... I mean, damn). It may be inspiring simply because it exists and Baldwin's words take on a greater meaning when put to these images, which Peck and his editors have assembled with great care but even a greater sense of purpose.There is importance to its message, but this goes in tandem with it being a profoundly moving piece of filmmaking, where so many images and sounds of brutality and racism, in the reality of the time, in those white faces set against black ones (i.e. that black teen going to school surrounded by people spitting on her) and in that fantasy-space of the movies and what they've shown over time (in a way this is as much of a movie about movies as La La Land might be from this past year, at least up to a point). While there could be a criticism that the movie goes all over the place with its subject matter, I found this to be a strength of the storytelling. This isn't some talking-head piece looking at Baldwin's life (there's a PBS doc for that), but rather this is simply the story of a man looking at three men who inspired him and sometimes made him rethink his ways and whose deaths caused him intense pain. And by the end of it all is a clip of him saying that he still sees hope, in a sense, in that he's not a pessimist - if the future of America as a whole is better than, perhaps, so it will be for blacks, since it is ALL America, ultimately.Wow."
" A Mirror Reflecting Both Injustice and Hope
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,9,"""Documentary"" is a bit of a misnomer when it comes to this passionate, powerful and frightfully relevant collage of a film. Documentaries are assumed to be informative; casting light on a subject the public knows little about or at the very least giving us insights on well worn subjects both private and public. I Am Not Your Negro does this – kind of. But mostly it pushes the boundaries of its audience and asks of you to seek answers to questions you may have only asked yourself in times of deep reflection. Raoul Peck's Oscar nominated movie is not a documentary – it's a mirror, reflecting the face of an angry, confused America.We enter the ""fractured state of mind"" of author James Baldwin just as he has committed himself to writing an account of three slain figures Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr. and Medgar Evers. What makes his hypothetical novel, ""Remember This House"" so poignant is the fact that Baldwin was friends with all three; each of their deaths in 1963, '65 and '68 respectively, taking an accumulative blow. Baldwin never finished the book though the words of his paltry 30 pages are folded into the film along with archival footage and excerpts of his previous writings. The words written by Baldwin are uttered by the deliberate patter of Samuel L. Jackson's voice while the footage of Baldwin speaking at regular engagements crackle with the intensity of his rhythmic voice. Even with Jackson's blunted utterances, the sharp insights and social commentary of Baldwin's prose peel away layers not just of an America reeling from the Civil Rights movement but written of an America that still exists today. Whatever you think about the civil, academic polemic, his words seer through the fabric of polite society. The litany of injustices cross-cutting through the film grow in conscious force and leery impatience; as if to say ""how can you seriously not see this is still happening!""I feel guilty in saying; the film caught me off guard and guiltier still for having the reason explained to me with intense sincerity. ""You don't see us, but we have always been looking up at you. We know you,"" says Baldwin. Then, as if to prove a lack of understanding to me personally, the film weaves images of famous films into the documentary's complex tapestry. It compares the lily white inner-monologue of Doris Day to the witless stare of Dots Johnson in No Way Out (1950). It compares the chaste reassured-ness of Sidney Poitier in The Defiant Ones (1958) to the frivolity of The Pajama Game (1957). Then the film asks a stunning question; ""why do you need the n**ger?""We like to think we live in a world of increasing intersectionality yet the recent uptick in active and pugnacious white supremacy sings a different, sadly similar refrain. In that regard, I Am Not Your Negro is not just great movie but a necessary one. It recalls the long, painful journey of ending legal segregation then rightfully calls out systems and individuals with segregation still in their heart. It then employs Baldwin's personal anger and imperfect point of view to gift us true, unadulterated feeling; a feeling of loss, a feeling of frustration and a feeling of hope.Critics of I Am Not Your Negro (at least the critics that matter) like to casually point out the lack of exploration when it comes to Baldwin's sexuality. There is one all too brief excerpt from an FBI report, hinting he might be gay. Other than that, the film remains silent on a subject Baldwin was decidedly not silent on. While I think it's important to explore the commonalities between Civil Rights and gay rights (watch Pride (2014)) and the compartmentalized nature of being black and gay (watch Moonlight (2016)), I don't think I Am Not Your Negro is trying to be that kind of film. It's complicated enough to translate the poignant thoughts of a ferocious social commentator and point that commentary towards a receptive audience. Adding on another layer to this already layered film would be like chopping down a tree from an entirely different angle. Plus, it's not so much about Baldwin as it is about, well, usI Am Not Your Negro is certainly an incendiary work, but it burns in much the same way a swab of disinfectant does on a recently made wound. The film left me with questions of not just race but culture as well. What does it say when a culture priding itself on moral ascendancy still can't stomach the realities of a permanent underclass of people? What does it say when our stringent individualistic traditions blind us from what is happening before our very eyes? And finally, where do we go from here?"
" Every American should see this film.
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,10,"The film ""I Am Not Your Negro"" will stay with me for a long time -- as James Baldwin's words always do. Beautiful editing by Sam Pollard builds a meaningful cultural bridge between the 1960s and our current decade. And the soundtrack -- opening with Buddy Guy's ""Damn Right I Got the Blues"" all the way to Kendrick Lamar's ""The Blacker the Berry"" in the closing credits -- is fantastic. Allow yourself to see the world through Baldwin's eyes for this hour and a half. It may open new parts of your heart."
" ""I am not your Negro"" is an unrestrained portrait of Race in the United States
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,10,"""I am not your Negro"": An unrestrained portrait of Race in the United States""I am Not Your Negro"", The James Baldwin documentary, is an unrestrained portrait of race in the United States. That is no surprise since it is based on his life and writings. From his life in France to his last works and speeches, this movie takes us on a journey with Baldwin and his lessons of historical racism. The film looks at media portrayals of race, from the Black mama, to the slave, to heroes like Sydney Poitier whom for White liberals was the definition of the acceptable, strong black male. However, for many Blacks, Poitier was the figure that allowed Whites to forgive themselves, as Baldwin writes. His roles allowed Whites to believe they weren't racist, cause hell, they liked this Poitier fellow. The famous quote goes, ""The story of the negro in America is the story of America."" Baldwin doesn't mean all history, he means the real history that you won't read in the history books. He means the tragic tale that made America possible, from slavery to segregated schools, to the military and the prison industry. The movie made my head hurt, just like what happens when I read Baldwin. So many of his lines have so much in them. They are multi-layered pictures of reality. They are unflinching in its condemnation not only of the racists but of the liberals that congratulate themselves that they don't use the wrong words or that they have Black friends or associates. But, as Baldwin points out, these liberals don't bother to cross the street to have dinner with Black families. The movie is dense like a rich cake that changes flavor the more you eat. During the film, Samuel Jackson reads Baldwin's words about Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr., and Medgar Evers, all people Baldwin knew well. We also see footage of his discussions on race and from a very interesting interview with him on the Dick Cavett show. Cavett missteps with some questions to Baldwin, but from the clips we saw, Cavett was smart enough to let Baldwin explain his position. When a philosopher comes on the show and contradicts Baldwin's views on race, Baldwin eloquently explains why this man is incorrect on race because ""his is a view of what he wants things to be, not of things as they are."" Interspersed throughout the film are scenes of modern day conflicts between Black communities and police: riots, beatings, killings from Ferguson and elsewhere while Jackson reads Baldwin's words. Clearly, Baldwin's words are still relevant today. Rating: Pay Full Price, see it Twice.There is nothing I can criticize here. Baldwin's words, the use of archival footage, the music, the editing were all spot on. And Samuel Jackson reads Baldwin's words nearly flawlessly. Peace, Tex Shelters"

But, I will not live to see the land I love (as imperfect as it is) - ascend to that full potential, and become all it should be for all that's reached its shores. There is a minority of people that feel they are somehow endowed by God to subjugate others for their own exploitation. This film demonstrates this in a very powerful way. Raoul Peck did an incredible job of bringing this story to life and demonstrating its significance in today's society.

" ""Are things at once getting better and still hopeless?""
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,8,"""I Am Not Your Negro"" (2016 release; 93 min.) is a documentary about the state of racial relations in the US , based on the unfinished manuscript ""Remember This House"" by James Baldwin. As the movie opens, we see TV footage of a 1968 Dick Cavett Show where Baldwin is interviewed, and Cavett retorts ""Are things at once getting better and still hopeless?"". The movie then dives into its basic premise: Baldwin looking at America through the lens of 3 African-Americans (Malcolm X, Martin Luther Kong, and Medgar Evers), all of which murdered in the 1960s.Couple of comments: this documentary is the labor of love from Haitian director Raul Peck. This is not your typical or straight- forward documentary, in that the voice-over (Samuel L. Jackson) provides no analysis or context, but simply reads from Baldwin's unfinished manuscript (from the late 70s-early 80s). Peck simply adds the footage, but what footage indeed. The movie is divided into various chapters (""Paying My Dues"", ""Heroes"", ""Witness"", etc.). We see multiple clips of Baldwin doing numerous TV interviews (including one from 1963 that also features Malcolm X and Dr. King), as well as rarely seen clips and photographs from some of the hot- spots in the civil rights movement . It truly remains shocking how ugly all of that was (check out the faces in the ""White Power"" footage), and it seems a lot longer ago than just the 50-some years when all of this happened.""I Am Not Your Negro"" premiered to critical acclaim at the Toronto International Film Festival last Fall, and I couldn't wait to see it. It finally expanded nationally this weekend. The Saturday matinée screening where I saw this at was attended poorly, I'm sorry to say. ""I Am Not Your Negro"" is a shoe-in to win the Best Documentary Oscar next weekend, and hopefully that will give it a much-deserved boost. ""I Am Not Your Negro"" is a must-see for anyone wanting to better understand racial relations in this country, so please check it out, be it at the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray."

",2017-02-16 00:00:00,10,"This is an excellent documentary by Raoul Peck on James Baldwin, writer and political activist. It details a period of time in James Baldwin's life that was very important to blacks in America. And, which made a heavy impact on American society. The documentary was compelling and intriguing.

" What a wasted opportunity!
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,2,"The Oscar-nominated 2016 documentary feature ""I Am Not Your Negro"" (PG-13, 1:35) is based on the work of African-American author, essayist, playwright, poet and social critic James Baldwin. So, to understand what this film's about and how it came to be (30 years after Baldwin's death), it's imperative to know something about Mr. Baldwin. James Baldwin was born in 1924 and raised in Harlem. Disillusioned and frustrated by the treatment of blacks in post-World War II America, he moved to Paris, but returned to the U.S. in 1957 to do what he could to help in the intensifying struggle for civil rights.No matter where he was, what was going on or who was criticizing him, Baldwin wrote, lectured and appeared on television talk shows explaining what he believed and advocating for social justice. Besides reflecting the experience of blacks and gays in America, Baldwin's writings were, according to Wikipedia, ""eagerly consumed by whites looking for answers to the question: What do blacks really want? Baldwin's essays never stopped articulating the anger and frustration felt by real-life black Americans with more clarity and style than any other writer of his generation."" This film offers many such insights.Baldwin's 1972 book ""No Name in the Street"" chronicled his experiences as a black man in 1960s America, focusing especially on the assassinations of Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. – all personal friends of Baldwin's. This book can be seen as the genesis and the core of ""I Am Not Your Negro"", which also fleshes out 30 pages of notes Baldwin made for a book (to be titled ""Remember This House"") that he had intended to write before he died. This movie tells the story of racial issues in America in the middle third of the 20th century through the eyes of a noted participant and one of its most insightful observers. If only the film had been able to live up to the potential of its source material.This film uses Baldwin's words (and words consistent with his thoughts, as extrapolated from his final unfinished manuscript) that go deeper than most in explaining the historic racial divide in America and chronicling the experiences of himself and others who lived through and participated in the height of the American Civil Rights Movement. We see Baldwin on screen periodically throughout the movie in archival footage from his speeches, academic lectures and appearances on TV talk shows. The rest of Baldwin's words (including the gaps filled in by screenwriter and director Raoul Peck) come to us through the expert narration of Samuel L. Jackson. Much of the history referenced in the film is illustrated through news footage from the 1960s and many of the points made by Baldwin and/or Peck are made through depictions of blacks and whites in movies and TV shows and commercials. There are also a few relatively recent photos and video clips which make the film seem more relevant than it is.""I Am Not Your Negro"" is an important movie whose potential is overshadowed by poor filmmaking. Besides reminding Movie Fans of some of the history of the struggle for black civil rights in America, the script delivers some valuable insights that will force audience members of all backgrounds to rethink some of their preconceived notions and long-standing assumptions about how people of different backgrounds perceive each other. In addition, some of the video segments and photos which appear on screen have rarely been seen in a cinematic production. Meanwhile, Jackson's narration matches Baldwin's voice so closely that it's easy to forget that you are listening to the distinctive voice of Samuel L. Jackson, creating the effective illusion that it's Baldwin speaking to the audience the entire time.Unfortunately, these significant positives are outweighed by negatives in the film's design and execution. ""I Am Not Your Negro"" never bothers to explain or even reference its own title during its runtime and has almost no narrative thread. Events and commentary seem to appear almost randomly and with very little effort to establish context or significance. Instead of using Baldwin's brilliance to shed light on the current racial divide in America, Peck seems content to leave Baldwin's observations in the past where they're frozen in time and place. Worst of all, the film lacks any positivity and offers no hope or ideas on how we can move towards a true post-racial society.What we're left with is little more than reinforcement for those who are already inclined to find racism in the deepest crevices of American society and in the most innocuous comments and actions of its people, while adding to the sorrow of well-meaning individuals who insist on wallowing in the guilt of injustices that occurred before their time and for which they're not personally responsible. I can't help but believe that Baldwin would be disappointed in how poorly his views are articulated and how badly they are squandered in a film which has gained enough attention that it could have made a real difference in moving forward the conversation about race in America. What a waste. ""C-"""
" A must see American documentary
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,9,"Narrated by Samuel Jackson (who does a fantastic job, by the way) and featuring American novelist, essayist, playwright, poet and social critic, James Baldwin, I Am Not Your Negro is a documentary built around Baldwin's books, essays, letters, notes, interviews, photographs and an unfinished manuscript he was writing at the time of his death in 1987. Remember This House is a 30 page incomplete memoir which reflects on Baldwin's personal recollections of and relationships with civil rights leaders Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr, and it also serves as the foundation for this documentary. Framed by a thought provoking 1968 interview Baldwin gave Dick Cavett on The Dick Cavett Show, I Am Not Your Negro also tells some of Baldwin's personal story as it relates to race in America based on his own experiences.There are a few impactful aspects of this work. Baldwin was a thinking man with a great ability to articulate his thoughts quite clearly and in a way that persuades you to agree with him, or at least consider the validity of his statements and his way of thinking. He had a unique gift; an ability to allow people to see things from his perspective – from the African American perspective. That's no easy feat; particularly when the historically tense issue of race relations in America is the topic of discussion; and I'd imagine it was especially difficult during those times when Baldwin was the only person of color present as he addressed a room full of white men.Secondly, the continued significance of Baldwin's words is sad, profound and astounding. His 50 year old interview could be spoken nearly verbatim today, as, unfortunately, Baldwin's points are still applicable. I Am Not Your Negro demonstrates this fact with strong supporting evidence that is hard to argue with.The way director/writer/producer Raoul Peck and this team built a documentary around these 30 pages of words and crammed it full of history from slavery to very near the present day is brilliant and beautiful and ugly and powerful. Some of the footage is painful but all of it is valuable and all of it is important.More than anything, what made me sad while watching this documentary was the realization that many of the people who need to see I Am Not Your Negro the most, will probably never bother. I'm sure the racists, the bigots, the hate mongers, the small minded trolls who hide snugly behind their keyboards, will have plenty of disgusting things to say about this movie, Baldwin and black people, like they always do. And I am willing to bet you none of the aforementioned would dare sit down and seriously watch it and listen to it, considering the cowards that they are deep down. I'm talking about those who are afraid they may have to do some independent thinking and some work on themselves and make some changes in their lives and to their thoughts and in their hearts, and dare I say admit they might be mistaken in their beliefs.Baldwin reminds us that we have been ducking and dodging the subject of racism in this country for far too long and it is glaringly obvious that this approach is getting us absolutely nowhere. It needs to somehow be addressed head on, as it is here, if anything is ever expected to change for the better, as we are currently living witnesses to too many changes for the worse. It remains the elephant in the room that comes up at every single opportunity, and there's a reason why it comes up and why it will continue to do so. It will exist until we all face it, admit we have a problem here, figure out how to deal with it and at least try to work it out.I Am Not Your Negro is an excellent, must-see documentary for all. My one small complaint is that for what may be the very first time, I wish a film were longer. This is a documentary that is chock full of information and I, for one, would have appreciated if a bit more time had been taken to relay it all. I mean, the energy of the piece is absolutely amazing, so maybe it's me who is a bit slow. It just seemed very jam-packed with information and visuals, at times, as you must keep up with which historic event is being highlighted. There is so very much to see and listen to and take in and process here. If you see it once, you might want to see it again to catch the things you might have missed the first time. And you wouldn't mind one bit.This documentary lends evidence to the fact that as far as we would like to believe we have come as a nation we have been lazy and complacent, we have been doing just enough to make ourselves feel better about ourselves – but it's not enough – and we still have a lot of work to do and much, much further to go when it comes to what we call ""race"" in America. I Am Not Your Negro digs into the gaping, unhealed wound of racism, prejudice and oppression unapologetically and forces us to take one hard, blunt, hour and thirty five minute look at ourselves, what we've done to one another, and as a result, what we have become. Go see it now!"
" This movie clearly, harshly, and beautifully explains where we need to start in order for the nation to change!
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,10,"Everyone needs to watch ""I am not your Negro"" especially those who don't understand white supremacy and racism. If you haven't watched the movie yet, please go. We all need to view this ""nation"" through this lens in order to make the necessary changes. Hoping it gets translated into many languages so all our peoples can watch and reflect! And ACT! Respectful shout out to Black Lives Matters and so many other communities that continued the work needed to be done even under Obama...maybe now more of us will be less spineless to fight the immaturity of this country's own understanding of itself."
" Powerful words of a very artistic man come alive in this motion picture.
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,6,"Very powerfulI loved Samuel L. Jackson's voice over in this film. Some of the best most dramatic work he has done in a long time.The type of connection I get when you know the problem, but means more when you hear other people articulate the problem.And how awkward that James Baldwin's words still ring so true, a little too true. Wish it was a little washed down cause that would mean African Americans went somewhere further since the 60s. But that's why we need documentaries like this. We are doomed to repeat ourselves which is why we need to know our history.http://cinemagardens.com"
" Must see !
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,10,"This film should be required for every American. It is one of the most important films of our time. It is lyrical, profound, historic and of this moment. And, at the same time it is profoundly intimate. James Baldwin is right here with us, front and center, looking right at us, talking with us, imploring us to consider the urgent questions he raised 50 years ago that are as urgent today. Thank you Raoul Peck. This is a masterpiece. It is as poetic as it is a demand for white people to come to terms with how they have constructed blackness and what, indeed, this means about whiteness. Peck includes one of Baldwin's most famous statements on this in the film: ""What white people have to do, is try and find out in their own hearts why it was necessary to have a n*#!er in the first place. Because I'm not a n*#!er. I'm a man, but if you think I'm a n*#!er, it means you need it. . . . If I'm not a n*#!er here and you invented him — you, the white people, invented him — then you've got to find out why. And the future of the country depends on that. Whether or not it's able to ask that question."" This is it. Our future depends on it. Baldwin cannot say it more clearly."
" Essential doc coming at the right time
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,10,"I am only beginning to discover the work of James Baldwin, such was the insularity of my high school and college experiences decades ago. Raoul Peck has done a masterful job of conjuring Baldwin's words (through the voice of Samuel L. Jackson) and examines the unfinished process of trying to write about the assassinations of Medgar Evers, Martin Luther King Jr., and Malcolm X. This is a heady task for anyone, much less a friend to all three, and to hear Baldwin's own words on the matter of race in mid-century America is heartbreaking and brutally honest. Mr. Peck has done a fabulous job of designing his study of Baldwin's writing, and the curated text is especially appropriate for our tortured 2010s. This movie should be required viewing."
" deeply moving, intelligent documentary
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,10,"Documentaries are supposed to make people think and possibly change. I believe that this documentary aims to do that. It is quite difficult to watch for any person, regardless of race, religious beliefs, etc. This documentary IS NOT about hate or blame. It is not propaganda. Such a view of the documentary is overly simplistic and misses the point completely. This documentary offers so much fruit for thought. It is about history, truth and reflection. It is about what could be. This documentary places James Baldwin into what appears to be a central role in the civil rights movement (one that is not widely appreciated) that derives from his literary inspirations, person experiences as well as his friendships with MLK, Malcolm X and Medgar Evers. These relationships are crucial to how JB understands (and articulates) the race problem, its basis and its detrimental effects on ALL of American society. We must look back to look ahead! This documentary provides an opportunity to look at racial divide DIRECTLY in the face and decide to do something about it."
" A Vital, Poetic and Groundbreaking Film
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,10,"There are many films which don't live up to their promise. This isn't one of them. Over the past few years, there has been a renewed interest in the breadth and scope of James Badlwin's incredible work. A complicated public figure from the 50s through the 80s, Baldwin's writings especially unraveled the narrative of a sameness within the Civil Rights era. He was a black gay man who felt passionately about the Civil Rights movement and who served as a major intellectual voice. In this film, Baldwin's work--which you get the sense the world wasn't yet ready for back when he was alive- - is forthright, intricate, rich with humanity and compelling in its case for inclusiveness, equality and for America to not become a hypocrite in its love for liberty. It is undeniable that the public conversation on race in America has once again resurfaced as a crisis. In every dimension of public life, we see and hear complaints of injustice, and we also witness the pushback. The purpose of this film-- as evidenced by its tapestry of older and contemporary clips alongside each other-- is to give new eyes and ears to the Baldwin asked us to see the world. It is a beautiful, touching and politically critical piece of work, and one that is long overdue for such a brilliant mind.I am well aware of how divisive conversations about race have become in the last 2 years. I suspect that much of the negative views voiced about this film are from people who are not willing to even watch it and who have decided that to shut their minds out from its message, or to even be challenged by a work of art. It's a disgrace that large swaths of people are trying to bring down the user reviews of this film by giving it only one star. It speaks of their gross immaturity and barbarism. If anything, everyone should watch this film. Not just judge it. But watch it."
" brilliant like the man
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,10,"This film brings genius author James Baldwin to life. His words and message are tremendously relevant today and help us understand how much work we have to do to understand race in the United States. Baldwin says ""I am not a ( n word that IMDb won't let me write and for good reason), and for white people to need there to be such a thing is something white people need to figure out."" As a white artist and social activist focused on undoing racism and studying and teaching the tremendous artistic legacy of African Americans, I could not agree more. I so appreciate the film makers artistry in bringing Baldwin to life right here right now. Baldwin's intellectual rigor combined with his fearless expression is a treasure to behold. Thank-you!"
" The Truth right in your face
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,10,"This film is a brilliant, no-holds-barred depiction of the TRUTH as it happened and was experienced by one of the most brilliant talents the world has ever known. There is good reason that it has been nominated for an Academy Award.Do expect to be disturbed because racism, sexism, and the effects of an evil regime are always disturbing -- such as current events continue to horrify ""human beings"" on a regular basis. However, for the person with evolved, emotional intelligence, being disturbed sparks powerful thoughts and action with higher consciousness.It is to be expected that those who are comfortable avoiding racial and racist truths will be upset by this poignant documentary. They will do everything from claiming that this is hate-mongering to insisting that the film-making itself is substandard. It is true that the racist will always attempt to claim righteousness and ""caring"" by casting aspersions on the works of others to avoid facing his/her own truth. As Octavia Spencer's character said to Kirsten Dunst's in HIDDEN FIGURES: ""I'm sure you believe that."" How you respond to this film is an opportunity to evolve what you don't know and what you already (believe you) do know. The choice is always yours to think, to grow, to communicate, to evolve -- or not.This documentary is a wonderful opportunity to not only see the world and life through the eyes of a genius, but to see your views of your life and world right now."
" Brilliant
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,8,"I've been on a roll lately with my movie choices. I've seen one delight after another and I get to add this movie to the list.I Am Not Your Negro is a documentary based upon the writings of James Baldwin in which the essence is Black-White race relations in the U.S. James was an eloquent writer and speaker so I may be doing him a disservice by summarizing the documentary as such. He'd probably say it was a lot more than that--and it was. In it we got an ode to Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King Jr. These three iconic figures of the Civil Rights era were all killed within five years of each other and none lived to the age of 40.There was a lot of riveting and provocative imagery in this documentary and it certainly will not appeal to a lot of people. There are some ugly truths about the American past that we all want to move on from but we'd do well not to forget.I loved the film. If for no other reason than being treated to seeing and hearing James Baldwin speak. He was a brilliant and eloquent speaker and I had no clue. One thing mentioned was how Malcolm X, MLK and James Baldwin all had different view points and different approaches to the problems of Black people in America. They all spoke a truth as they had different backgrounds and different outlooks. But what is undeniable is that they all had the uplifting of their people in mind and all three personalities were invaluable to the African American cause.This is a documentary that is going to disturb you and wake you up out of your reverie. The film is replete with historical footage and photos as well as recent footage--there are clips as recent as present day Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump--so you can't just relegate the picture to ""old news"" or ""stuff from the past"". It is relevant and as James Baldwin alluded to: it is a problem that has to be fixed because the survival of the country depends upon it."
" Thought Provoking
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,7,"This is a pastiche film that blends archival footage and photographs with old Hollywood movie clips and a running dialogue of Baldwin's words from the few seeds of a book idea he only started. It never seamlessly all fits together in a satisfying manner, but most of what Baldwin spoke of all those years ago, unfortunately, still rings true today.An important film to be sure, but it didn't really tell me almost anything I didn't already know, although I would guess I am in the minority here. As the great Frederick Douglass stated long ago, ""Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never has, and it never will."" That is true whether one is on the 'wrong' side of the color line, the socioeconomic line, the political line or the gender line.Considering the limited source material and what the director was trying to (ostensibly) achieve, it was well put-together technically, but even at 1:35 it felt a little long. Still, Baldwin's words remain powerful, and seeing him and hearing them all these years later reminds us of the old saw, ""Those who do not remember the past are doomed to repeat it."""
" An amazing use of cinematography and historical footage
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,10,"Note that the reason this is 5/10 stars right now is that there is a large bloc of people who have given it 1 star (presumably the white supremacist crowd). There is no way that anyone who believes in the need to tell black history would give this anything less than an 8/10.This cinematography was absolutely incredible, the use of historical footage to stitch together a narrative of the Civil Rights movement combined with recent footage makes this movie incredibly timely. James Baldwin proves a brilliant orator, and the story takes you through both his life and his relationships with Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, and Medgar Evers. This movie tells more black history than I learned in my entire public school education, and should be seen by everyone."
" View at your own risk, it looks like they want you to hate people.
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,2,"I saw this on a DVD screener and You have to love Samuel's narration. I enjoy his astronomy documentaries. This film doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it a documentary or just a hate-filled rant against the wrong people? I'm an autistic black man, myself. Maybe there is something I'm not getting, but I don't blame any white people for my problems. All that racial stuff in the movie happened decades and decades before anyone alive today. Most of my doctors are white (and one lady from Jordan) and they are AWESOME. If you look for the good in people, you will find it in all colors(including Whites).I think it is important to have a historical perspective, but you have to do it without blaming your neighbor now. Did anyone read the bible? Love thy neighbor. If there is someone specifically who does me wrong, I don't blame his entire race. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. I say LOVE, not HATE."
" In Every Way That Matters...
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,9,"There are so many ways to feel and experience and comment on this film.AS A WRITER: For lovers of language, phrasing, and meaning, hearing James Baldwin's writings and seeing him speak is enough to spark the highest praise alone. His capacity for observational conclusion and his use of language to transmit these conclusions is extraordinary. In this, he is one of the finest chroniclers of the American condition, not just one of the finest African American chroniclers. If you don't believe that going into this movie, you will when you come out of it. Spending close to two hours listening to the man's work is an utterly intoxicating experience. In this regard the film is extraordinary.AS A FILM LOVER: We know that James Baldwin was a cinephile and one of the great film critics in American history. He wrote extensively about cinema and a large part of this film consists of clips from Hollywood's rough history of reducing or falsifying the black American experience, often with Baldwin's own criticisms laid on top of them, weighing the clips down, eviscerating them. There are hard juxtapositions here as well, such as the innocence of Doris Day pressed up against the reality of lynched black men and women swaying in trees. By contextualizing these images in new and fresh ways the film is able to paint an impressionistic portrait of American denial. And despite a small handful of shots that don't entirely synergistically ring with the Baldwin text (I'm thinking of a few clips – by no means all - that the filmmaker himself shot), there are enough times when the words being spoken and the images being shown are so surprising and spot on as to be true, high, art. In this regard, the film is extraordinary.AS A HUMAN BEING: The greatest moral failing of this nation is not its imperialism, not its militarism, not its materialism or escapism or consumerism, – though the film makes a strong case that all these things are tangled together – America's greatest moral failing is its racism. And the scalpel procession with which this movie uses Baldwin's words and character to autopsy this vast cultural sin is inspiring. Baldwin himself was never a racist, though God knows, I wouldn't blame him if he had been. Baldwin was never a classist or a nationalist or a demagogue of any sort. Baldwin was a man. He demanded that he be perceived as a man and that black America be perceived as people, with all the dignity and rights that affords. He looked America in the eye and asked a simple question, why do you NEED to dehumanize me? And he followed the question up with a statement, as long as you dehumanize me, America can never succeed. It was not a threat. It was another of his observational truths, the idea that our racism undoes us, keeps us from being great. In the way ""I'm Not Your Negro"" illuminates Baldwin's call for a higher humanist agenda, the film is extraordinary.AS AN ACTIVIST: The film implies that the most horrifying thing you can do to a movement is to kill its leaders. Not just because you deny dignity and rights to the people who look to those leaders for hope, but you also impact the movement for generations. The natural order of generational transition, that a great leader will grow old, evolve, change, and teach the next generation how to lead, is violently interrupted. What we are left with is the idea that there is nothing Malcolm X or Martin Luther King could have done to keep from being killed except to be silent – not an option for either, nor for Baldwin. X was killed even as he was becoming less militant, less radical, reversing against the idea of ""the white devil"". This ""evolution"" did not save him. King was killed even as he was becoming more radicalized, more desperate, slowly walking back the rule of love for the rule of forced respect. This ""evolution"" did not save him. There was nothing the White America that killed them wanted from them but silence in the face of dehumanization. And in its subtle, artistic, nuanced way, this film is about all of that. But it also ties itself to the moment. Images of Ferguson, photographs of unarmed black children left dead in the streets by police, video of Rodney King being brutalized beyond any justification, all of it means that Baldwin's words ring timeless, his call to action not remotely diffused by our distance from him and his time. In this regard, the film is extraordinary.AS A LOVER OF PEOPLE: Baldwin is by no means a traditionally handsome man, but he is a striking one. His charisma is nuclear and his face is always animated. When he speaks, the depth and warmth of the content play across his features. His eyebrows lift all the way to the middle of his forehead when he pauses to gather his considerable intellect for attack. His eyes turn down and to the right when he knows he's eviscerating an illegitimate institution. He punctuates an observation with a smile so genuine and wide that it emits its own light. To watch him command a talk show or a lecture is cinema enough. In that it gives us the gift of watching Baldwin speak – among so many other things - the film is extraordinary.I guess I have some small aesthetic qualms with the way the film is put together, but to what end? These are my own little opinions about the tiniest minutia of filmmaking. Personal hang- ups on a certain cut here or there, useless criticisms on a work that succeeds so profoundly in all the most valuable and important ways.The film is extraordinary, important, and genuine in any and every way that matters, and that's all there is to it."
