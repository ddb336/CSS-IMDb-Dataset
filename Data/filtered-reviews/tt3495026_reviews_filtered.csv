" A Brilliant Revenge Story.
",2021-04-12 00:00:00,10,"""Fan"" is a film that gives you that rare feeling of complete satisfaction. In its core this is a thrilling revenge story told with unusual characters plots and even casting. Untold stories always captivate the viewers and 'Fan' does exactly the same thing. Starting off in a happy mood, Fan goes through the usual character intro and song dance numbers. SRK as Gaurav did a wonderful and convincing performance as a young boy obsessed with film actor. SRK also portrays Aryan, the actor, Gaurav's victim, quite brilliantly. The revenge plot in this film is very unique in a sense, the film does show how the world of a God can be shaken down by a seemingly powerless mortal. The film as a whole was very surprising with its story arc. Maneesh Sharma in the director's chair, did a terrific job in telling this beautiful story. Looking forward to his 'Tiger' film. What goes unnoticed during the entire film is the supremely flawless VFX work. Unbelievably magical. Red chillies is breaking barriers with every film. RaOne, Fan and Zero are perhaps the best advertisements of Red Chillies VFX ( also kudos to SRK the producer and founder of the company). SRK beneath all his stardom and glory is a person who is in love with cinema, giving his best in every project."
" difficult to match King Khan's performance
",2021-03-16 00:00:00,10,"I'll try not to be emotional in this, although as a Shah Rukh Khan fan I felt waves of emotions while watching the movie and after it ended it was an emotional moment to see the King Khan back with a blinding, thundering, stupendous performance for which we (the fans) have waited for so long.The idea of the movie was interesting, and the script has several plot holes, some of them, pretty big. Character consistency of Aryan Khanna the star is dubious. But.... what gives?The overall execution, that is, the direction, the dialogues, the pacing, the grey areas, and above-all the performance of SRK which sometimes makes it a one-man show simply because he doesn't allow you to see anything else. For non-fans of SRK, this movie will show them how to play a character of a young person without behaving like a half-retard, ears and eyes popping out, juvenile character whose puerile emotions are only based in innocence. For the average Indian audience whose cinematic vision derives from star worship and alignment of the star with their own personal values, ""intelligent acting"" equates how they see the world and what they are fed as ""acting"" and ""cinema"" packaged as ""intelligent"" which is as genuine and honest as ""Patanjali"" Maggi.But SRK, thankfully, didn't fall into that straitjacket. There are moments in the film where you could be wondering about how a certain thing could be possible (don't want to give away spoilers) but not for one second, will you have second thoughts on credibility of emotions portrayed and character portrayed.Go and see this film if you want to see good performances.Yes, I wrote good *performances*, because honestly speaking, there are two people in it--SRK the star, and SRK the actor.I'm so glad I finally got to see the actor, for which I became his fan. Proud of my star."
" Something that is far away from nonsense remakes, something that is purely new.
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,10,This guy has the guts to always bring something new for his fans and for the sake of Indian cinema. But he never gets appreciation. This movie and SRK are really made for each other. No other star could gave justice to the dual roles in the film. Only you can imagine SRK for these roles having large fan following in real and have to potray the same in the reel. Genuinely Wonderful movie with lots of Hardwork.
" Nothing special
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,4,Green screen is visible worst CGI bad acting even for main actor . Movie with a weak concept.
" Unrealistic story.Just directing is good.
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,1,Unrealistic story.Just directing is good.So people who don't use their brain find it realistic because of direction.But I gave 1 star because this movie is fooling publics
" Perfect for a fan

" Challenging Performer- SRK
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,9,"This movie has all that is req to make it a worth watch.

" Best performance of SRK pure masterpiece movie
",2020-07-30 00:00:00,10,"SRK is totally just awesome in this movie
What a thrilling screenplay with SRKs top performerce 2nd half is totally breathtaking
1st half us pure classic total masterpiece FAN"
" Good but not the Best.
",2020-07-05 00:00:00,6,"It is a good movie but certainly not the best of SRK. On several occasions, it got bored and I was left wondering when will the movie end. Yes, some scenes seem to drag on for life. Hence, I was forced to fast-forward on multiple occasions.The story is about the fans' obsession of the superstars. In the movie, Gaurav (played by SRK) is a die-hard fan of movie star Aryan Khanna (played by SRK again). He acts, thinks, breaths and looks like SRK. His obsession for him leads to Aryan Khanna's where Gaurav is not given that much attention of Aryan as was expected from him. To seek Aryan's attention, Gaurav resorts to illegal stuff such as kidnapping the rival of Aryan. However, obsession takes a turn when Aryan does not approve of the attempts of Gaurav to seek his attention.Dejected, Gaurav decides to take revenge from his star by destroying his career.The way SRK has been able to do justice to both of his characters is commendable.Overall, the film gets 6 from me. I think the score does justice to the film. In no way, the film deserves an 8,9, or 10. Those giving more than 7s are probably real life versions of Gaurav. :P"
" Something different
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,10,Something different. A man playing a role of himself and his fan at a same time. The efforts Srk put to become Gaurav is amazing.
" Started like a comeback movie of SRK, but ended very trivially due to lack of story
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,7,"Story-line => 3/5 ( Buildup was nice but ending was boring and predictable );
Acting => 5/5 (SRK did a good job there. );
Directing => 3/5 (First half of the movie was very interesting to watch, but ending was very sloppy);
Visual Effects/Animation => 5/5 (CGI team should get a round of applause for the job they did with two SRKs. );
Screenplay => 3/5 (Got boring and repetitive);
Personal Recommendation => 3/5 (If you are a fan of SRK and want to watch some good acting, go give it a watch. But while watching the movie I lost interest in the middle because of the bad continuation.);"
" FAN (2016)
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,8,One of Shah rukh's best films of the year may be for this past decade of his films in my perspective.This reflects the real hindi film fan fare mind set with a much more stronger and a great visionary style and substance through entering a mind of an ordinary man but a film fanatic of Aaryan Khanna (Shah Rukh Khan) and he himself calls him Aaryan Jr. is Gaurav played by Shah Rukh himself.This film have no villains and there are no good guys. And that's why this makes an amazing movie with a human element both fighting for there personal persona and identity.Amazing film with great art and substance + this is in a decade Shah Rukh playing a dual role since Don (2006).Overall - 4/5
" Shah rocks...
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,7,Superb performance by Shah...reminds me of DARR and other shah's hits of 90s....if u r a fan of SRK...u will love to watch it again n again
" Amazing Thriller!!!!
",2020-01-25 00:00:00,10,"I think this was one of the best movies ever of Shah rukh khan!
This movie proves his excellence as an actor...how could he not win a best actor award fot this mind blowing negative role! I will never forget this movie ever! This had to be a blockbuster (why didn't it be so?!)
Note: not a fan but a genuine reviewer"
" Outstanding
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,10,"This is I think one of the best performance of srk ...
Movie did not performed well at the box office but it was something that people could not understand at that time ...
It was something different from Bollywood...
I don't think anyone could have done this better than srk and nobody can do any role like that....."
" Great SRK Movie!
",2019-12-08 00:00:00,10,After a long a very good movie with a very good story from Shah Rukh Khan! Thoroughly enjoyed!!!
" The horror of brain powder
",2019-10-06 00:00:00,8,"The hero finally jumps off the building to commit suicide is really very distressing, the irrational star-chaser has arrived already very popular. Not to mention the extreme event of jumping for an idol, the groupies I've heard about in my own country are already very extreme.
Fans of Chinese traffic star Cai Xukun can be described as extremely stupid. Once, somebody sends a problem on the network ""the mother dies and Cai Xukun catches a cold you choose that.""? "" Someone immediately said: ""Mother died! "" What's more, my whole family can die. "" However, Cai Xukun's fans are all primary and secondary school students, and it is not surprising that their minds are immature. But it is because of mental immaturity that Cai Xukun and his fans are disgusted by most Chinese Internet users.
On the other hand, this movie, although adults make less irrational star-chasing behavior, but it is enough to warn us: idols are only part of life.
Back to reality, it's hard to find a star like Aryan and sincerely persuade fans to live their lives. In reality, idols are not actors and singers, just one person. This person is set up like a coin machine, constantly creating profits for the operating team behind it. The irrational pursuit of fans is to constantly use their own and their parents'money to chase a person or team who just makes money from him or her."
" A good film, brilliant acting and cinematography
",2019-09-08 00:00:00,10,"The movie is mesmerising. It is dark and gritty and has the audience at its grip till the end.
The story of a young fanatic whose life revolves around his only idol is not what you get to see in a movie quite often.
If you are interested in corny jokes, senseless humour, songs or heroine, this may not be the movie for you.
There are bit loopholes but that is overshadowed by the plot and the excellent cinematography.
SRK- His best acting in a movie since My Name Is Khan."

" Fan Is the Ultimate Psycho Thriller People Having Been Dying To See
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,8,"Fan is the quintessential psycho thriller film you have been dying to see. The storyline and acting are absolutely spot on. Shah Rukh Khan portrays the Bollywood superstar he is, but his performance as crazy fan, Gaurav is priceless. Everything about the movie from start to finish is intriguing, from the Gaurav's initial shrine to Aryan Khanna to his sabotage tactics, there is not a dull moment. One of the strongest points in the movie is the suspense. Each twist and turn, including the tactics that Gaurav creates, will surprise the audience and leave them wanting more. In the end, Aryan Khanna does not get killed or severely injured by Gaurav's tactics, which avoids the movie of any sadness, but the guilt and pain from the stalker situation continues to haunt him, which may show a worse effect than a physical injury. While Fan is an amazing thriller film, it feels more like a modern Hollywood film than a classic Bollywood film. This idea is due to the fact that there are no song and dance sequences. According to the article, ""Inside and Out: Song and Dance in Bollywood Cinema"" in the Bollywood Reader, ""It is agreed upon that if there is one feature that radically distinguishes Bollywood from other cinemas, it is the ubiquitous presence of the song and dance sequence. The difference is most keenly felt by western observers used to the very different conventions of Hollywood filmmaking,"" (Gopal and Sen). The absence of the song and dance sequences in Fan takes away from the Bollywood essence. The only scenes in the movie that are close to resembling these song and dance sequences are are only show performances from Aryan Khanna and Gaurav's impersonation of Aryan Khanna. Bollywood cinema places a large focus on the moral universe. In this film, there is a high emphasis placed on the characters and catching them in their actions. Their intentions in regards to the moral universe are not pointed out until the end of the film, during Aryan and Gaurav's final confrontation, while in most other Bollywood movies, the moral universe is a common running theme throughout the films.
Fan is another example of a film that exposes Shah Rukh Khan as a glorified, young, and beautiful character in his portrayal of Aryan Khanna. His portrayal of these characters can especially be seen in DDLJ and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham where he is the hero of the story and the protagonist stud of the whole film. He has never served as the film's antagonist or villain in these films. However, his portrayal of Gaurav differs from the usual characters he portrays, as he is vulnerable and ""the bad guy"" in this role. This is the first film I have witnessed where Shah Rukh Khan plays the story's antagonist, more or less both the protagonist and antagonist in this particular film. Overall, this film is very well done, captivating the audience from start to finish. I would highly recommend that everyone see Fan."
" It was a delight to watch SRK
",2018-11-13 00:00:00,8,Shahrukh has given his one of the finest performance in this movie. The story is good and chemistry between his both roles amazes me. Overall its a good movie and worth watching.
" good
",2018-11-10 00:00:00,7,"Flim is good with awsm vfx ,
story and direction is very bad
srk is only actor to play this types of role he is amazing
without vfx and srk acting whole flim is waste"
" SRK Does Obsessive Roles Best!
",2018-09-08 00:00:00,5,"There have been so many negative reviews about this movie so I was a little skeptical about it. But it's Shah Rukh Khan and I really wanted to see how this movie went. The opening sequences with Gaurav Channa, the 25 year old Aryan Khanna fan were sweet and seeing his love for his idol was nice.But the escalation of the movie into pain and revenge was a little jarring. The motivations of the character to ruin Aryan Khanna seemed a bit unnecessary. The obsessive compulsive nature of the character was on full display when he beat up someone who had insulted his idol. SRK does obsessive characters with a lot of conviction and it really translates well on screen. The plot, though, could definitely have been reworked to make it better. Acting wise, no complaints, Shah Rukh gives other big stars a run for their money. A lot of action scenes that took up a lot of run time. I wanted to skip those scenes because nothing else was happening. Had a thriller angle been taken for the film, instead of wasting time and money for VFX on the stunts, this movie would have been much better.All in all, an entertaining film that brings out SRK's acting chops as an actor who can really do negative shades well."
" Two stars cut because the editor messed up the movie
",2018-08-31 00:00:00,8,How much important editing is to a movie is clearly visible from this one. It could have been masterpiece but the editor messed it up. SRK at his peak for the last time. I wish they could have found a better editor.
" Amazingly Well Done
",2018-08-27 00:00:00,10,"Gaurav (Shah Rukh Khan) bears an uncanny likeness to Bollywood superstar Aryan Khanna (also played by Khan), and as a result he becomes obsessed with Aryan. When Gaurav goes to Delhi to meet Aryan and is refused, he looses his mental balance and becomes determined to ruin Aryan.The strength of this thriller is not the plot, though it is suspenseful and well-written, but the make-up. Khan as Gaurav is made to look just enough like the real Khan while not looking like him. Tough to explain, but it works perfectly. Khan gives a great performance, as well, playing both parts superbly. While this isn't a perfect film, the amazing cosmetic artistry pushes the movie into ten stars."
" MASTERPIECE
",2018-08-22 00:00:00,10,It's one the best performance of SRK...he nailed as gaurav chanda...its one of the entertaining and emotional and very close to my heart
" Best Movie?
",2018-04-06 00:00:00,10,When your watching this movie an average SRK fan will this movie :)
" Fan (2016)
",2018-01-01 00:00:00,10,"SRK,what an acting.. Gaurav and Aryan Khanna characters are superb.. it's an awesome film.. Fan superb movie... SRK rocked in the film... bgm was good and the theme music was good..."
" One of the Best films i've seen
",2017-09-25 00:00:00,8,"Fan is probably one of my favorite films I've seen in a very long time. It not only provides an interesting story but also many strong dramatic and thought provoking elements. The plot is about a fan (Shah Rukh)who looks up to a movie star (Shah Rukh too) as most of us do. His goal was to meet him in person because of his immense respect for him. Sadly though Aryan the movie star doesn't want anything to do with him and creates his biggest enemy from his most beloved fan.The movie really has no good or bad guy which adds a lot to the story, everyone has a good enough motive at first. Eventually though they both take it to the extremes to try to stop each other. I haven't seen many Bollywood films but this is by far my favorite, good acting all around! It all leads to an amazing climax that may leave you thinking about what you just saw.I would completely recommend this movie for the humor, visuals, and plot alone but Shah Khan's performance as both the fan and the star pushes it to amazing levels. go see it now!"
" Great Story, Poor Execution
",2017-09-23 00:00:00,1,"Another great movie which fell to poor direction. Completely flawed with loopholes. Even if the movie is not based on a real story it still had a capability to attract a lot more attention than it already did. SRK did a good job, however there wasn't much he could help with the plots. Indian cinema needs to take an example of how a great story can lose to a bad script and loopholes. Had they used the help of a crew that adds more content to support the direction and explain to the audience with some concrete evidence as to why a plot is progressing in the way it is. Fan is a good example of how a movie can either be 1 or 10. Bollywood needs to understand that Indian Cinema is evolved and is smarter and you cannot present such a low standard story line. Great idea behind the movie but absolutely poor execution."
" Finally, a worthy follow up for Darr.
",2017-08-11 00:00:00,7,"When I look at Shah Rukh Khan as he is now, a very old man, the Rahul from DDLJ has left the body, laughing on TV shows begin the down to earth guy with sounds on the background that tells the viewer you have to laugh, I thought his genuine acting career is over. Not for his fans. Forhis fans it will be over when Khan doesn't breath anymore. But for film lovers who have seen all his movies and compare them to the movies he is making now, there was a little hope like a last breath of an old man.Shah Rukh Khan delivers with this movie. He still shows that he is a great actor. He shows it twice by taking a double role. On one hand he plays himself and at the other hand he plays his own fan. During the movie you know he is both of the men, but the way he acts gave me the feeling I was watching two different men. That is quite an achievement. The first confrontation between the men was very exciting. The second chase was unnecessary.I grew up watching srk's movies. His overacting habit as a young man made him the king of Bollywood. Now I am older myself and only a fan of my little daughter, I can really enjoy an action thriller like this. Yes Shah Rukh made his dream, but lives in a big house surrounded by walls. Sounds like a prison to me, but every achievement has it's costs. Great actor, great movie."
" Impressive
",2017-07-31 00:00:00,8,"This review doesn't really contain any spoilers but I think everyone should watch this movie as I did, with absolutely no prior knowledge of it. So consider that a spoiler warning, of sorts.Anyway, some friends brought the DVD of this movie over one day. Prior to this, I'd never even heard of it. I knew the lead actor's face but forgot his name, Shah Rukh Khan, if I ever knew it. Seeing the cover with the two faces, I assumed it starred two actors that just happened to closely resemble each other, and not being able to read the extremely small print on the DVD I was not disabused of this notion. I even thought, ""Isn't it interesting that these two actors look so similar.""Watching the film further enforced the idea that I was watching two different actors. Gaurav looked somewhat like his idol, fictional movie star Aryan Khanna but not identical. For one thing, Gaurav had less of a curve to his nose than Aryan. Gaurav also looked younger and there is one scene where Gaurav take his shirt off, showing a less impressive physique than the one I've seen in pictures of the Khan; Gaurav also seemed to be shorter than Khanna. Also, of course, the two characters appear in scenes together.When I later checked IMDb later to see who this actor and saw that the two parts were played by Khan, I was dumbfounded. I could hardly believe it. I'm still having trouble believing it.This is even before taking into account the seamless way the two characters are integrated into scenes. While that is obviously amazing and reinforced the idea that I was watching two actors, Khan's performance as Gaurav is what impresses me the most. Khan basically plays himself as Aryan Khanna but he utterly disappears into Gaurav, albeit with some help from the impressive makeup, prosthetics and/or digital wizardry to make him appear 20-30 years younger; but the performance is still impressive, any way you look at it. I thought making Robert Downey Jr. look young in Captain America 3 was impressive, but it's simply nothing compared to this.As for the story, it starts off a bit slow, but picks up the pace soon enough. It features a couple of chase scenes that may drag on a bit too long, but they're certainly not a deal-breaker."
" fan is a masterpiece
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,9,"Fan is an exceptional movie. Shahrukh Khan has delivered his career best performance in this movie. Maneesh Sharma has done a lifetime direction. the editing is excellent. dialogues, locations, actions are splendid. last of all, shahrukh khan should get Oscar for this movie. the movie is not everybody's cup of tea. it is made for class audiences."
