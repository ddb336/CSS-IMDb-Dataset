" Nothing XXL about it.
",2021-03-23 00:00:00,1,How do you make a movie like this so unsexy and so damn boring? Geez. Unattractive cast and just not entertaining in the least. You've been warned.
" Nice film
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,8,"It's confusing: this film is actualy directed by Steven Soderbergh. Among the actors I missed a few who are important. Mathew mcConaughy for example. In stead of him you mention a row of unimportant female actors that don't play a role of any importance. Some of them look so alike, that it is confusing which caracter you are dealing with. I could appreciate this film only after a second viewing. But it is a good film after all. Better correct this site."
" Absolutely horrible
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,1,"I enjoyed the first one. I was looking at the clock 15 minutes into this one.I stuck with it, but it never got better. The plot was stupid and there was not one redeeming scene to even mildly save the movie.Definitely in the top 10 of worst sequels.Avoid this like The Plague."
" Just for fun
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,10,"I felt I had to write a review because there are so many on this site hating on this movie.
This is a movie about hot guys dancing - what this movie delivers.... Hot guys dancing.The first magic Mike film was seriously depressing and anyone who says they 'loved' it is obviously a flagellate that likes a bit of punishment for their sins.This movie is far more fun. The dance routines are better than the first flick and everyone looks like they are having a good time.Get some friends together, have a couple of champagnes and have a good time along with them."
" The film is true to its purpose.
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,9,"The film does not try to be more than it intends to be, the film knows its limits and respects that, it does not have a SUPER worked plot or anything, even because the film does not need it, the film only needs to present what it was promised, strippers, just that, a simple narrative, with captivating characters, a cool rhythm, that's all a film like this needs and that's what is delivered to us. A good movie."
" Um.....no
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,3,For a movie that ie glorify the wonders of man stripping.... it's almost like making jaws with a goldfish. In parts the movie is boring and completely unjustified performances by all a decent.... But the plot concerning Tatums return to stripping is nothing short....tedious..Skip it....
" Aging strippers on a roadtrip
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,4,"I wasn't expecting much from this based on the first movie but you still have to see it, right. I'd hoped for a better story this time or more actual stripping but nope, this is more of the same except even worse. Story as it were follows retired stripper Channing Tatum as the band gets back together to put on that ""one last show"" at an exotic dance convention in Myrtle beach. For the most part this is a road trip movie and that's about it.There's no real storyline here, no interesting side bars, zero character development, the dialogue is long, meandering and hard to follow (actually I think they made it up as they went along.)There are a couple of cool dance sequences, but no choreographed routines or stripping per se just dance moves (or singing) and aggressive man handling of female spectators. Joe Manganiello does a very sexy act towards the end and I also liked the 30 seconds Channing bumps and grinds in his workshop while attempting to get his groove back and that's about it."
" Waste of your precious time
",2020-03-27 00:00:00,1,"I think propably, for sure one of the worst movies out there. Skip it with no second thought."
" Kind of... useless
",2019-11-15 00:00:00,4,"The movie was so bland that I don't even know what to write in the review.
It's just very boring and the actual dancing scene are comparatively short and not very creative.
A real waste of time"
" NO!
",2019-10-12 00:00:00,2,"VERY few times I have not been happy/excited to watch good looking scantily clad men. This is one of those times, like the first Magic Mike. Tatum seems to believe he has moves, but he is WRONG! No effort seems to have been made preparing for these parts. Sheldon, Howard and Leonard have more sex appeal than these guys."
" Bad
",2019-05-16 00:00:00,1,"That movie is so bad, there's nothing good about it everything is bad, the movie doesn't mean anything it's just stripping...
Not good acting not good cinematography the story sucks.
Just don't waste your time watching it."
" Awful
",2018-12-30 00:00:00,1,Good bodies. That's all! Such a stupid movie! Still no idea what it is aboutüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª
" Shirtless
",2018-08-05 00:00:00,10,Shirtless men like the whole movie it's great but don't go in to the movie thing it going to have a real plot it's not that kind of movie
" Slow and boring...
",2018-01-21 00:00:00,2,"The plot is too simple, and they talk too much for a stripper movie..."
" Nothing magic about this film!
",2017-08-25 00:00:00,5,"I watched Magic Mike XXL tonight. What a waste of time! I do like Channing Tatum but in this film he was lacking well everything. He stumbles through the film, always wearing the same backward cap. Apart from the dancing scenes, the film is very mundane. I was fast forwarding through most of it. I also didn't like the choice of actors like Kevin Nash and Amber Heard, in my opinion they can't act! Some of the music was good but overall boring."
" Pointless...
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,1,"I'm supposed to write here a minimum of 5 lines, whereas my summary ""Pointless..."" says it all already. I haven't seen the first movie from 2012 and came accidentally across MM XXL. Even though some reviewers here say the first one was better... well... I guess I'll simply skip it. I gave in to watch this one because my wife wanted to watch it. However, in the end even she thought it was BS."
" Occasionally fun, but ultimately forgettable stuff
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,5,"After the cult success of Steven Soderbergh's Magic Mike (2012) - a loose adaptation of star Channing Tatum's experiences as a stripper (or male entertainer) early on in his career - it was of little surprise when a follow-up was announced. What made the first movie such a surprising success was the way it mixed the flashy dance moves with genuine character development, making for a touching and oddly sweet experience that also touched on themes such as the economy and the American Dream. For XXL, the focus seems to be solely on giving the audience what they want, and that means more abs, biceps and bulges.However, this all means a half-arsed story-line that quickly finds a way to get 'Magic' Mike (Tatum) back with his gyrating buddies. The end of the first film saw Mike abandon the life he was never truly happy with and realising his dream of starting his own company selling custom-made furniture. The company is either struggling or about to take off, but it's clear that Mike is still unfulfilled, and when he receives a phone message from Tarzan (Kevin Nash), he is soon enough on the road to a stripper convention with 'Big Dick' Richie (Joe Manganiello), Ken (Matt Bomer), Tito (Adam Rodriguez) and Tobias (Gabriel Inglesias). That's generally it. Magic Mike XXL's main issue is that the story seems to fumble around trying to come up with interesting places to take its characters.Very much a road movie at heart, the group find themselves encountering new characters along the way. With Cody Horn not returning (her disappearance is rather unconvincingly explained,) the love interest this time around is Zoe (Amber Heard), a gorgeous bohemian-type who doesn't seem to be put of by Mike's distinctly douchebag-y dress sense. There's also Andie MacDowell as a horny Southern lady who, along with her wine-guzzling friends, indulge in a private party. Mike also hooks up with his old friend/lover/colleague Rome (Jada Pinkett Smith), a sort-of stripper madame who hosts a house to entertain the ladies, and whose employees include the smooth-talking Andre (future young Lando Calrissian Donald Glover). There is sadly no return for Matthew McConaughey as Dallas or Alex Pettyfer as The Kid, who have apparently both eloped to Europe chasing a lucrative stripping deal. Gregory Jacobs also replaces Soderbergh as director.The new characters provide to be little more than a distraction from the meandering plot, which forces Mike and his pals into a few moments of utter tedium. When the film stays with the guys and just allows them to shoot the s**t, it's actually very funny, and leads to the best scene of both movies by letting a pilled-up Richie loose on a grumpy-looking gas station clerk. By trying to do more by giving each character their own emotional arc, it actually holds back a film that would be better served giving the audience even more of what they really came for, stripping. Even for a straight male, the dance scenes are electrifying, with the climax delivering an all-out dance-a-thon that allows each character their moment to shine. It made me smile between the dull moments, but this is ultimately forgettable stuff."
