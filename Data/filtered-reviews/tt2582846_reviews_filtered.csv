" Love has not time
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,8,"When we watched this movie. You""ll see it . You can fell in the love every time and in every situation.nothing can be hinder to love when you find ur half lost ."
" Ops, Emotion overload
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,9,I can't say any word because just finished the movie and maybe my is going to ending some kinda this way! lol
" A praise to life
",2021-03-17 00:00:00,8,"One of the best young adult movies around. The title is purposefully set to remind you of the star-crossed lovers in Romeo & Juliet. Instead of being part of two competing families, impending death by cancer is the doom that looms over these lovers. The movie makes the two leads deal with more than a young life should have to deal with - and it is taking a stand for trying and risking things - whatever the odds are and whichever cards life have dealt to you.
Both leads give a charming and credible performance and it is fun to see how their romance develops with delicate steps.
Overall a memorable movie."
" Wonderful
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,8,"Well made movie. Touching you and make you think about life. What made us human, true love and just love. Recommended one. Don't miss it."
" Pain demands to be felt to see the brighter side of life
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,10,"I can write essay on this movie but will keep it short that its not about pain and grief, its more about how you enjoy the precious little moments in your life and remain grateful for having your loved ones to feel those moments together and it might require you to feel your pain as ignoring it will make you more weaker
Life is beautiful and as said by author some infinities are bigger than other infinities, you will never have the world which you want but you can choose the people you want to stay which make you happy"
" So touching!
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,9,"The fault in our stars
Drama, Romance 2014These movie tells the story of the relationship between a girl and a boy. Hazel Grace and August Waters met in a support group of patients with cancer, and then their relationship starts. Hazel was a girl that never consider dating, because of her disease, as August was a boy scared of oblivion. They live a big adventure together, trying to meet the author of Hazel favorite book in Amsterdam.I've read the book before seeing the movie and in my opinion the actors were amazing and could definitely transmit the emotions of the characters that you realize when you read it. The plot it's wonderful, there are both heartbreaking and heartwarming moments. The story made me think if I'm really enjoying my life and making the best out of it or just existing, as we don't know the what will happen the next day.It's totally worth-it the two hours that takes to watch these incredible touching movie!"
" 2021-2-15
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,6,"This is definitely the most beautiful version of cancer people I've ever seen. But it's a romance movie so I assume that nobody cares ;P This is a bit too slow and I felt sleepy in the middle. "" She didn't want a million admirers, she just wanted one "" I want one too but I just couldn't find him. The boy ,gus, also in the movie Baby Driver, was very cute ;p"
" you will be thinking about this film days weeks months later

He is also awesome in this as well this195cm male found himself crying at various points through the film and felt genuinely sad for what happened its a beautiful story and film and heartbreakingly heartbreaking I absolutely loved this film.

",2021-02-01 00:00:00,10,"This movie is great, has the highest highs and the lowest lows and boy is it amazing but so god damn sad."
" The Fault in Our Stars on 4k ultra hd
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,8,"I found a used copy of the extended edition with the pretty slipcover in good condition (without a digital copy but I can live without it), and I'm curious to know how they packaged the bracelet because I didn't get.P.S. why is the slipcover so tight? This applies to any other Fox title. Sometimes it even ruins the plastic cover because I have to squeeze it in the slipcover now on upgrade Upscaled 4K and Dolby Vision coming soon on Disney and fox release September 2021"
" true love
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,7,"The strange link between romance and disease does not prevent if love comes in all situations, then love remains a beautiful picture that every gathering conveys"
" Full of emotion
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,10,I've watched The Fault In Our Stars probability 100+ times and I somehow manage to cry every time I see it. This movie is truly beautiful. I felt changed as a person after watching it the first time. I couldn't think of better actors to portray Hazel Grace and Gus.
" Interesting love between physically doomed souls
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,6,"Great photography, super performance from Laura Dern, and a cute love duet between Gus and Hazel, interminably shot from favorable angles to highlight their good looks. Facial expressions are repeated ad nauseum, not to reveal anything about their personalities but because they are such darlings (get your hankies out - quick!)In between, you see a fellow who loses his girlfriend because he is about to become blind as a result of cancer in the retina, and who takes revenge by pelting her car with rotten eggs.And you get Willem Defoe as a do gooder who pays Gus and Hazel a trip to Amsterdam but is really nasty at heart. Incidentally, the touristy shots of lovely Amsterdam probably paid for this flick - in fact, under the veneer of a sensitive, romantic love story, you have the hard reality of Hazel's parents who can't afford to take their terminally ill daughter abroad but then do so with great abandon and at obviously great financial cost. Financial tightness does not stop anyone taking rooms at the most expensive hotel in Amsterdam and drinking the best champagne.The syrupy eulogies at the end add a further dimension to the falsehood at the heart of this movie. No one suffering from the fatal diseases affecting the characters in this movie should be under any illusion that this is a pic designed to make money under the pretense of making people feel better about the always difficult subject of death.I suppose I'm too cynical and I've lived and loved too much to be conned by this copout."
" The Fault in Author Stroking Own Ego
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,3,"Based on a book about a girl's dying wish of meeting the author of her favorite book, it doesn't get much more self-serving than ""The Fault in Our Stars,"" a tedious, young-adult fiction tear-jerker concerning a romance between two cancer kids in addition to the annoying author. I viewed this Hollywood adaptation after seeing the Bollywood version, ""Dil Bechara,"" for which I now have a greater appreciation in comparing it to its American counterpart. The Indian movie replaces the book-within-a-book with an unfinished song (Bollywood's reputed fondness for lousy tunes proving true again), but more importantly it adds a cinematically reflexive layer by adding a film-within-the-film and equating the story's fatalistic narrative with cinema itself. Now that's a metaphor--a much more interesting one than that stupid unlit cigarette. Albeit, the rest of ""Dil Bechara"" is melodramatic drivel just as with ""The Fault in Our Stars,"" but at least there was the skeleton of a compelling idea there and not merely a couple trips to Funky Bones park and a revolting make-out session at the Anne Frank House.The one thing ""The Fault in Our Stars"" does better is story continuity, but that's just the stupid soap opera junk. Weepy histrionics with a message of living life to its fullest but that doesn't itself enrich lives. A book about an obnoxious author who doesn't have anything substantial to offer. Veteran actors Laura Dern and Willem Dafoe are wasted."
" Chick flick worth watching
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,10,I am not the one to binge watch romance movies but this one will forever be top three for that genre if not numero uno! I love this movie and it will bring you to tears no matter how tough you may be. Its good to feel these kinds of emotions sometimes!
" What I felt after watching TFIOS
",2020-12-18 00:00:00,8,"The Fault in Our Stars is a beautiful movie based on the novel ""The Fault in our stars "" and I would recommend it to anyone who believes in love and has the courage to fight for it. Through this book I realised that cancer not just touches victims, but it also touches all those who love.
As a whole, we spend a great deal of time trying to avoid pain but, if we read carefully, The Fault In Our Stars also teaches us that ""pain demands to be felt"" and ""the universe likes to be noticed."" No matter how we try, Gus is right- we don't get to choose if we get hurt; it is a near certainty that we will.He teaches Hazel that every life should be a full life. He believes that everyone should leave a mark on the Earth. Augustus shows her that even if you won't live long, you can live an exciting and complete life.
It's a great movie with lot of life long lessons. I will highly recommend people to watch this movie for atleast once."
" Very good.
",2020-11-20 00:00:00,10,"This movie is a heart touching, it tell us that us that the people living in cancer or any other problems have to face so much difficulty. This even made me cry."
" It's very deeeep, concentrate!!
",2020-11-19 00:00:00,8,"Cancer is just a phenomenon in this movie, watch ot with open mind not pity for people who fight with cancer,
It's about the meaning of life...
Listen carefully to the dialogue, it's full of lessons.
Yes, it's a bit boring, but it's amazing"
" Sad
",2020-11-17 00:00:00,7,"This is a sad movie. It got me in my feels. Still, the characters are not great."
" Cancer can be beautiful!!
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,7,"MovieMom1973 here!! okay so i watched this movie with my husband and teenage daughters and i have to say just really well done!! after the movie we all talked about it and my husband and i agreed that we hope our daughters find men like augustus waters one day!!there was one scene where the main couple kiss in the anne frank house and the people around them started clapping!! it was so sweet that we all started clapping too!! it really made us realize that there can be beauty in all things, even scary things like cancer!!so why not a full ten out of ten rating for this amazing movie?? well i do have to warn everyone that there is a scene where the main couple sleep together and that kind of thing isn't appropriate for children like my teenage daughters!! they also use bad words sometimes!! please remember that impressionable children are watching these movies, hollywood!!one thing that was really sweet was that some of the characters say ""okay"" as a way of saying ""i love you,"" and i thought that was just such an amazing thing!! my husband and i have been trying to find a word like that for ourselves!! so far we've tried ""hello,"" ""alright,"" and ""toaster oven!!"" we haven't found one that sticks yet though!!all in all i want to say that it is a really amazing film but again please do be careful with showing it to your children!! okay!! MovieMom1973 signing off for now!!"
" 10/10
",2020-10-20 00:00:00,10,"Best movie i ever seen or maybe within 5years.
Best feel good movie"
" The peace in love
",2020-10-18 00:00:00,10,"Every time I watch the fault in our stars, I was touched by the love story of these two cancer patients. A good story, makes people motivated that there is someone who is able to love us and accept what we are. This film received many awards and deserves to be the best teen film in history."
" I'm crying
",2020-10-13 00:00:00,8,Why you gotta do me like that... Cried reading the book and cried watching the movie. The book was better though (always is)
" Broke my heart
",2020-10-13 00:00:00,7,"It's a beautiful love story but heartbreaking, I've cried a lot. But I was expecting more."
" Its nice
",2020-10-09 00:00:00,7,"Its nice, but I think movies like A Walk to Remember really made me cry and felt more real."
" My Favourite Romantic Movie Forever.
",2020-09-30 00:00:00,10,"One of the best romance movies I have ever seen and one of my favorite movies that I have ever seen. I loved the book and I loved the movie even more. The writing, plot, story, and screenplay were fantastic. Shaileen Woodley and Ansel Elgort's performances in the film as Hazel and Augustus were spectacular. The Fault in Our Stars is gorgeous, funny and sad at the same time and it shows true love can be found no matter what. Loved it so much."
" Simply 10
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,10,"I watched this movie after years again and went to see reviews here. I am truly disappointed by all those bad ratings. Noticed many times how Ansel played his role without emotions. This is simply not true. Ansel and Shailene did amazing job, with right amount of emotions. Makes me sad seeing all this reviews saying this movie is not worth watching it."
" I'm just Wow
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,10,Nothing to tell much but this movie is a combination of Fun and sadness ... I laughed and I cried in this movie .. they're so so realistic and I'm impressed at their acting .. well played ! Best Romance movie ever
" The book is outstanding. The film is meh.
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,4,"I finished reading the book with puffy eyes and a lot of tissues. The film was poor in comparison. The director made the film twee instead of an intense, all-consuming first-love story. We've all had that 'first love', the passion, the angst, the discovery of ourselves but add terminal cancer into the mix, so the film should have been infinitely better than it was."
" Even better the second time.
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,10,"I watched this 6 years ago (seems like a lifetime, doesn't it?) And it has aged like Dom Perignon.If you don't cry, you are absolutely void of humanity.I highly recommend this film to anyone that doesn't mind being moved."
" Heart Touching And Emotional Journey
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,9,Hazel and augustus have different types of cancer. They met in support group and agreed to read each other favourite books. Later Gus tells hazel your book end was incomplete and after got mail from author's to come and got answer and then after both journey became emotional and lovable. Each aspects of scenes are made beautifully captured and satisfying with great bgm.
" Mayb even better than the Book and the best Movie about Love ever made
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,10,"I read the Book. Loved it.
I was unsure about watching this Movie, because it seemed to be Cheesy just
by looking at the Cover. But don't judge a Movie by it's cover.
These are my favorite Movies in this Category:2. All the bright Places
3. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
4. P.S. I love YouAnd all i can say is, that this took my Number 1 Spot.The Acting is superb. I loved both of the characters and their chemistry.
Never have i been on an emotional Rollercoaster like this.
It's crazy and maybe one of these Movies i'm gonna watch again.
And that rarely happens.35 old male btw.F#k the haters. I honestly don't get anyone who trolls this.Just watch it. Prepare Tissues.I#m not gonna save my 10. I am gonna leave it here because this Movie deserves it.And mayb it is even better to read the book after watching... ;)"
" A poignant and heart-affecting love story about two teenagers with cancer squaring off against death.
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,10,"Most love stories end with 'and they lived happily ever after'. But what happens when you may not live another day? Will you still fall in love, knowing your time is limited?
The Fault in our stars Stays faithful to the book. What you see is what you get. When a practical Hazel (Shailene Woodley) meets the charming and cheerful Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort) at a cancer support group, sparks fly. He fears oblivion, while she believes it's inevitable. In his company, she discovers there's a world beyond hospitals, medication, pain and cancer. Their shared passion for books, common fears, and heartfelt talks make the two inseparable, until death comes knocking...
If you like feel-good, escapist films, this one's not for you. The Fault in Our Stars is one of the most unpretentious tragic love stories told in a heart-warming manner. 'Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened' pretty much sums up the story.
Earnest performances lend depth to the characters, making them come alive. Shailene Woodley is brilliantly melancholic while Ansel Elgort displays the complexities of his character with great maturity. The film is not about crying over what you may lose, but learning to live with what you do. After all, it's not the fear of death that makes you bitter, lack of love does."
" A must watch movie !!
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,10,The movie is so beautifully directed ! Hazel Grace is my favourite character from the book and it was played by the actress perfectly. The movie is very similar to the book unlike dil bechara which totally ruined the script . I give this 10stars for not ruining the originality and portraying the characters very well . I loved the soundtrack too .
" Heart breaking!
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,10,"There are some movies you shouldn't watch if you are emotional. And if you are not emotional then you should definitely watch it, so you know you are a human. This movie will make your eyes full of tears and your heart will bleed. Thank god it is just a fiction. This should never happen in real world. This is a heart breaking story which should not be missed."
" Sad, But A Beautiful Love Story in my whole life
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,10,"The Fault In Our Stars is definitely one of the best romantic movies ever. When you see this movie you are going to laugh and you are going to cry and when the end credit roles I can guarantee most of you are going to be completely in love with this love story.And this movie is bound to get you crying like there's no tomorrow. I've never cried so much in my entire life.
Though this was ""THE SADDEST"" movie I have ever seen, it was also one of the most beautiful, as it truly showed how exhilarating and comforting and exciting love is.
At least I want to say 'Some infinities are bigger than other infinities' says my favorite quote from the movie and its true because I am going to love this movie for the longest of the infinity."
" The best romantic movie of all time!
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,10,"What can I say? it's literally a perfect movie that will make you cry. I loved every thing about this amazing movie, Every thing is perfect, the story, acting,.. there is absolutely no word that can describe this fantastic movie.
I loved both characters especially shailene woodley. she is just amazing! and she definitely deserved oscar for her perfect acting! I usually don't cry when I'm watching movies but the fault in our stars was so emotional that made me cry. l have watched a lot of romatic movie but I can tell you the fault in our stars is definitely one of the best romantic movies of all time! Of course titanic and the notebook were my other favorite romantic movies too"
" This movie is love😘
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,10,"Music, emotions, and a beautiful love story...loved this movie just an awesome adaptation the novel of the same name.."
" Changed a part of me
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,10,"""The Fault in Our Stars"" isn't just some romance film, it's life. Only after watching this I realized that your life is not yours alone, it's also part others. This the first movie review that I have written, and that's because this movie has something that other movies don't. It change's your view of the world, people around you and that's why it is worth watching. -""My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations.""-"
" SAVING MY 10.
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,9,BEAUTIFUL EMOTIONAL FILM. LOVED EVERY BIT. MESSAGE IS CLEAR. LIVE IN THE MOMENT AND ENJOY YOUR LIFE DOING WHAT YOU LOVE UNTIL YOU CAN.
" ultimate foof
",2020-07-17 00:00:00,3,"I remember seeing this in theaters an actually enjoying it. But that was a long time ago. This movie is not good. The writing is foofy, the characters are obnoxious and I don't think they're very likable at all. I found myself rolling my eyes far to many times, scoffing at the goofy unbelievable dialogue. And I love romance movies. Boo Shaleine Woodley Boo Laura Dern I was entertained though. If Willem Dafoe wasn't in this movie I would rate it a one. Hooray for Willem Dafoe the alchy jerk!"
" A Wasted Opportunity
",2020-07-12 00:00:00,3,"This was the director's first film and it shows. Almost every instinct about the filmmaking is wrong. Both he and the director of photography should have been fired. How can you go wrong with such a great story - the book is wonderful - and this amazing cast - not a sour note in the whole cast - kudos to the casting director - but the bricks and mortar of the shots and locations make this like watching paint dry. The lighting makes everything so drab and not in a clever way to mirror the action or progression of the cancer, just bad lighting. This is shot like a movie of the week and if those are your expectations then you won't be disappointed - but if like me, you were aware of the buzz around this book to screen adaptation, you would be forgiven for expecting a little more. If you don't have the budget to shoot an epic love story then find the epic in nature - 0/10 for cinematography. To go all the way to Amsterdam and have nothing more than commonplace ambling along the canal shots - just shocking. Back to the drawing board. Perhaps I will live another twenty years to see the remake with a cameo from Shaileen as the nurse administering the cannula."
" Loved this!!! Best combination of Emotions and laughter.
",2020-07-06 00:00:00,10,"I would rather prefer to watch it again before reviewing it because the first time when I was watching this movie I was completely indulged into characters. Probably the most loving and emotional film i have ever watched. As being a avid webseries and movies viewer I can say it has a perfect storyline, script, cast and direction. All actor's performances are commendable. I would definitely refer this to everyone please do watch. To whoever is reading this, you aren't going to be disappoint. Thank you."
" ""Pain, Demands to be felt""

Its full of romantic moment and even some funny moment."
" The fault is not in the Love story and Emotions but the Fault is in the additional Metaphorical theory.
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,7,"The Fault In Our Stars (2014) :
Movie Review -The fault is not in the Love story and Emotions but the Fault is in the additional Metaphorical theory. I remember skipping this film when released because i had read the synopsis of Novel and i thought it won't look exciting due to predictable plot. Now i thought let's give it a watch because the bollywood remake is about to release and it would help me to decide which adaption was better. In bollywood we have seen such love stories already, may be not exactly as it is but very similar and proudly more emotional so i would be eager to see how Dil Bechara is shaped. When i went through the basic story of the novel 6 years ago i didn't really find anything allegorical but yes it sounded very emotional and heart touching. I have seen many of that stuff too so again its like losing little more interest. Anyways now i have seen it and i would like to point out some mistakes instead of admirable things because mostly emotions end up making less sense. But no need to take this review so negatively, i am saying it before i begin bashing that i would still recommend this film to everyone so you please watch it regardless of what mistakes i point out. The Fault In Our Stars does full justice to the love story and emotional story from the original novel but couldn't overdo the metaphorical proportions when there was a golden chance. I don't need to explain about the love story and emotions of this film because they definitely work and are difficult to hate. The problem is in the detailing of the plot and metaphorical portion which has been sidelined for the sake of emotions. See, there is a girl with thyroid cancer who falls in love with a cancer affected boy who has a great sense of humour. He brings the happiness in her boring life and all that portion is presented beautifully in the film. I started loving the film in first 10 minutes only which doesn't happen regularly. The dialogues and scenes in the first 50 minutes were wonderful and shockingly intellegent. Then the film lost the grip when most of its humourous quota was finished, this is where the film came one step down from it's high level. Next, the metaphorical and subtle thoughts were sidelined because we are not so smart audience and we love to see typical emotional and love theories instead of intellectual stuff. Then onwards i begun to search for mistakes in every scene and the level was one down again. I just wish what if the level was kept solid high throughout? The film would have ended as an Unforgettable Classic. I just couldn't understand how all of sudden the guy with great sense of humour started behaving like a common man? Was it because he fell in Love despite knowing that his life gonna end soon? Didn't he have that much brain to understand it? Does falling in love means you should lose your intelligence? On the other side, that so called girl who is Smarter than others has nothing to freak out than just meeting an author of book? How can she be so desperate for such a small and ignorable thing? When did she behave smartly to be called smarter? Wait a sec, her parents had money for the expensive treatment since childhood but has no money for one freaking trip to Amsterdam? Poverty? Seriously? The author has been given so much importance nonvigilantly, what's his role in the film actually? How did he help in the impact of the story? It was just another Normal character. Now one of the biggest problem is the climax scene. Well, the climax is not a problem, the problem is not elaborating the connection of it to the earlier scene when the girl tried to avoid the boy for his own betterment but at last she realises that he already knew it. That's metaphor but many people didn't get it because it wasn't presented smartly. Technical errors of the film cannot be ignored, such big errors they are. Cinematography and editing is so bad occasionally. Finally coming to the positives, the acting of both the leading actors is fantastic. Laura Dern in the side role was adorable. Dialogues in the first half are amazing, clapworthy and highly sensible but as bad in the drag moments of second half. Direction is very good considering the aim of paying more attention to the emotions and love saga but like i said, i want to repeat again, the Subtle and Metaphorical proportions of the film deserved to be explored in terms of Greatness. Overall, a Very Good and Adorable film but unlikely to work as a tear-jerker and unlikely to be called a work of a Genius.RATING - 7/10*"
" It's Amazing
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,10,"One of the best romantic movies I have seen!Really heart touching cause J really felt the moment!
And this movie is recommended for all to watch cause there is things to learn from this movie!"
" A beautiful love story
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,10,A love story so magically told. It makes me want to fall and love and feel this way about someone one day
" Really a wonderful Movie
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,10,One of the best love shows the feeling of love in emotionally.The direction made the story better than that wrote in the book. The love of two people who are counting their days happily.It really a a awesome movie.
" The Book was better
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,3,"Even the book will get only a rating of 7.7/10 but it's still a mystery who gave this film 7.7! Ansel Elgort was very poor, he had no clue about his character, tries to act bluntly like Augustus from the book and fails. Shailene woodley and Nat wolff saves the film. Nothing much for Dafoe's standards. Watching this movie will quash 'your' imagination of Gus and Hazel Grace. Better avoid this movie. 3 stars for the effort they made."
" What???
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,2,"This movie is awful. How can you sit down and watch a movie, where a girl with cancer is so obsessed with an author who wrote a book about what having/dealing with cancer feels like, when he has NEVER HAD CANCER. ""It's so amazing, it's like he really knows?"" Wow. Idk about you but that sounds disgraceful to people who really have cancer out there. Come on man. I think thats messed up. You will NEVER know what something is like until you experience it."
" It does it's job, but...
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,6,"Many critics flamed this film. One of them said that these drama/romance movies about cancer are cash-grabs on subject. I think there are truth to these words. This film did it's job, it made me cry, I enjoyed watching this, but most of it felt forced and unrealistic. Many things wouldn't work out in real life. I do agree that this film is very inspirational and romantic, but it feels quite forced.Also what the hell with the whole cigarette concept. It's disgusting, it's supposed to be inspirational, but it looks retarted instead. Weird advertisement I guess."
" Impressed!
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,9,"I am not a fan of romantic movies, but some of them just happen to seep through because of the great writing and wonderful performances by the cast and this was one of them, i was thoroughly impressed. went in expecting a very predictable and cliche boy meets girl, they fall in love, they have some big fight, break up...only to get back together and happy ever after like over 75% of the flicks in this genre but this was oddly fulfilling. i definitely would give this a second viewing, wonderful."
" Love is as good as life
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,7,"Hazel showed more delicate feelings and insights into life than the boys of the same age, but the passion and vitality of Augustus still infected her and brought her happiness and hope. This was originally a cliché story, but the background of cancer makes the plot and lines of this story more touching. Everyone is fragile, but they are also strong and brave."
" Beautiful movie

How great is that?""The Fault in Our Stars"" was a great book and to be made in a movie with excellent performs was amazing to see.This movie is sad but beautiful. It makes you appreciate the people and little things in life.Great job cast and crew. You made my heart happy."
" One of the best sadistic movie
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,8,Acting and plot is excellent. I can't help being crying after watching this. The movie depicts life's of teens having chronic healt conditions.
" The title holds true to its core
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,2,"Before indulging myself to watch the movie, I thought of getting a grip through the novel. So i purchased it with great expectations and was keen to read. But then, it felt like am wasting time with Green's endless ands and a desperate try to make you get a feel of story. I left it unread after fourth chapter as i had already lost hope and left with no interest continuing further.Then i thought of checking out on the movie atleast, just to prove myself wrong as 7.7 stars meant something. Again, by the 30 minutes something, i was helpless and started fast forwarding it. Alas, it finished and i had no remorse for i dint waste my time in this peice if c***.Guys, you really want to get hold of movies which are based on similiar concept, try Wedding Dress; one word, impeccable. This story seemed stretched and made attempts to make you cry starting from beginning that 'am cancer patient with this and that' and i dint get what not.Heh, even 2 is beyond expectations."

" Fault in ours stars review
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,9,"A lot of my family get cancer sadly so I understand how sad cancer can be. When I saw the trailer for this it looks like it would be good even know it a sad kind of romance. I recommend if you plan on watching this movie you might have to have tissues on hand just in case you start crying becuse the ending is quite a sad one but in a good story way. The two main character had get chemistry together. The romance was great. The story had lots of emotions like happiness, sadness and so much more. The ending was so unexpected when I first saw it I didn't think it was gonna ended up the way it did. I knew something sad was gonna happen but I didn't expect it to happen to who it happened too. I highly recommend this story anyone who doesn't mind watching sad romances once and a while."
" Not entirely cliche, but also not entirely enjoyable
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,6,"I think most people have heard enough about The Fault in Our Stars to know what they are getting into. So, making complaints about the way it manipulated me emotionally seems a bit foolish. Yes, it is a tearjerker, much like any movie that deals with cancer and death. I expected to cry a number of times with this film, and I did. That's neither a good thing nor a bad thing, because it's what I anticipated, the only thing I was hoping for was that I'd get something else I didn't expect. This kind of heavy romantic drama can utilize a lot of clichés, and I was hoping this one was beloved because it broke the mold a bit. In some ways it did, I was particularly pleased that they didn't fall into the trope of the jealous and controlling parents who don't approve of their daughter's romantic relationship. Instead they were kind and loving parents who merely wanted what was best for their daughter.There's another somewhat unexpected element to the story, but I'd rather not discuss that in case someone reading this plans on seeing the film someday. I think where The Fault in Our Stars disappointed me, though, was in the plotline of the author. I won't go into too much detail, but a lot of weight is put on a particular book in the film, and there are some interactions with the author of that book which I found to be a frustrating cliché. It feels like a cheap plot construction merely to get the main character to face her fears, instead of a useful part of the story. Aside from that, I can't criticize too much about The Fault in Our Stars, but I also can't say it's all that enjoyable to watch. I suppose if you're in the mood for a therapeutic cry, then this might be the film that could accomplish that for you, but watching teens suffering with cancer and facing their inevitable death isn't my idea of a good time."
" Heartwarming and Engaging
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,9,"It has been the 4th time I have watched this film. Everytime I watch it, it really appears brand new to me. The storyline it self is a gem and the execution too is way brilliant. Though the ending was too tough to watch still it is so special. The performances of the lead actors and the ensemble cast is just brilliant. I personally love it till now and will surely recommend it. Do give it a watch."
" Lovely Story yet lacks important aspects
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,8,"Its feels great when your loved novel comes to the life. I enjoyed reading novel and had few expectations from the movie. But sadly it disappointed in few main areas. I should have known it before that a movie cannot really depict everything out of a book. A female friend of Hazel is missed out, important signs of pain felt by Augustus is missed out, the author of Immperial affection is not the person which was described in book, hazel had to search for Augustus letter everywhere and finally she gets it via Author's assistant which was hand written as per the novel. Similarly many points are missed by, off course the movie has done really good job for depicting such long story in a 2 hour film with really nice background musics. I would still suggest this anyway."
" pain
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,8,"There are many commendable points here. The male host let his friend break the trophy. The male host takes his friend to drop the egg. The male host is afraid of being forgotten. The funeral in advance. These are not just about love, thinking about life, I think some places are a bit like the Titanic, how can the living person bear the pain of the death of the lover"
" Accurate to the Book
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,10,"This movie is absolutely wonderful. Full of raw, honest emotion, it is sure to make you cry. It isn't just a cancer movie. It's a love story. It's a comedy. It's thought-provoking and engaging. You feel for the characters and you actually want to be involved. This is an amazing coming of age story that is good for all ages."
" Augustus
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,7,"There are so many difficulties and setbacks in this world, Augustus is like the sun can drive away all the haze. It seems that everyone in the world is lovely, even cancers, the inevitable fragility will always pass.
I want to be a person like Augustus, smile to the world, and give only one reason to hurt myself.
You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world but you do have a say in who hurts you.
OK?"
" Just like I imagined
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,9,"The perspective that this film tries to influence about living, the meaning of life and death, of enjoying every moment and doing what really matters is interesting. Life is short"
" Extended version is quite powerful
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,9,"I haven't seen this since theaters just because it was so emotional I wanted to spare myself. This review is for the extended version which is actually just a touch better because like the book it's not afraid to show a little bit more truth of the situation. This teen weeper is about a young woman named Hazel played by an always strong Shailene Woodley (The Descendants) whose had cancer since she was young. She tries to deal with stuff as realistically as possible even when she meets hunky, swoon worthy Gus played by charming Ansel Elgort (Baby Driver) in a star making performance. They have great chemistry and he pushes her boundaries giving her somewhat of a new lease on life. Initially I was more moved by the parents story and their amazing performances by Laura Dern (Jurassic Park) and Sam Trammel ( True Blood). I still felt like that was very strong but with the extra footage I was really enamored with the central relationship. Although I'm 40 I really felt their story and was even more affected by it's tragic outcome. Funny, sad and powerful Fault is one of the best weepers of all time.Budget: $12m
Domestic Box Office: $125m

Acting, story, music, screenplay everything is beautiful and a treat to watch."
" Life
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,8,"The two protagonists in the movie have overcome their own fears after getting along with each other, falling in love, and experiencing death. Augustus already understood that one should seek a deep-loving admirer, not the admiration of the whole world. Hazel, perhaps when he suffered Augustus 'love and death, also understood his parents' feelings about himself. We all came to this world in order to bear love. Our death also bring pain to those around us. But pain should be felt and can be tolerated too. This is life. Perhaps, when we discuss cancer, the most we think about is probably life itself. There is luck and happiness in life, as well as pain and misfortune."
" Not that good
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,3,"I think the strength of this movie is in the way it touches the audience, but I don't think this is enough at all

",2020-02-22 00:00:00,7,"This is a cool and charming movie about love, I think that it is one of the most well-written one of the 2010s. The acting performances are touching, you expect the end, but you don't know how fast it will come this is interesting in the movie.On the other hand, the story wasn't really realistic, I can't tell to much about it, but the end doesn't make a lot of sense."

" I WOULD GIVE IT A CONSTELLATION
",2020-01-22 00:00:00,10,"Giving 10 stars to The Fault In Our Stars would be an understatement. I'd give a constellation if i could. This movie turned out to be an outlet to my emotions. I've been emotionally unstable from the past few days worrying about what my future holds and thinking about all the mess i've been through. In all this fuss i havent exactly valued the life i have and this movie showed me how grateful i am to be with and spend time with the ones i love and to have them right by me; that i have tons of memories yet to create with them. It doesn't really matter how much time you spend with someone but how you spend the time you have. Hazel and Augustus gave each other a ""FOREVER"" in a number of days. Only a person who has seen death can deeply understand how important it is to live your life fully and to live each moment to the fullest. The most important thing which links a viewer to a movie is how an actor connects himself with the character and how he potrays the emotions on screen. I could actually feel the pain when hazel lost augustus. He wanted to be remembered by everyone but to be remembered by the special one is enough. To me the quote ""some infinities are larger than other infinities"" imply that some moments no matter how small they are but if they hold the essence of true happiness are greater than other moments. God has given us one life and though we can not change our fate but we do get to change the path which will lead us to our destiny. NJ"

Shailene and Ansel give us an incredible performance that was so heartfelt, so true, so... real. Sure, there were parts I didn't like but it's one of those films that doesn't take itself too seriously so you can experience it in your own way. Yes, it was sad, I think we gathered that from the trailer, yet maybe we need a little darkness...

" The Fault in our stars undoubtedly does what every entry from that genre promises to do; make us cry like babies, mucus dribbling down our snoot and all.
",2019-08-27 00:00:00,6,"The Fault in Our Stars, based on the bestselling Young Adult book of the same name, belongs to a very particular subgenre, which combines teenage romantic drama and debilitating disease. I have seen only a few movies belonging to this genre. Love Story (1970) is apparently the movie that is the gold standard in this genre. I have seen its modern successor, A Walk to Remember (2002). Suffice to say, I wasn't in control of my emotions for the next three days, and it might have cost me ten-fifteen marks in my XIIth Board English language exam. So, in spite of knowing nothing much about the movie outside of the trailer, I armed myself with a healthy dose of cynicism and went to the theatre.And I cried.2014 was the breakout year of Shailene Woodley. She had just wrapped up her TV show and her last four movies were the Oscar winning The Descendants (2011); the indie hit the Spectacular Now (2013); the experimental thriller White Bird in a Blizzard and dystopian thriller Divergent (both released in 2014). The last one, also based on a bestselling YA franchise, had made her a global star, and she had by then firmly established herself among the talented crop of young actresses in Hollywood. She continues her fine acting form here, portraying the cancer patient Hazel Grace Lancaster with great sensitivity and wit. She conveys energy of a doomed teenager exceptionally well, compassion oozing from her body, and quiet strength in the way she defies the role of a cancer patient. Eschewing self-pity, Hazel tries to manage her emotions while acutely aware of her parents' struggles, which she knows in her heart she will leave soon. Trying to make sense of her emotions, the well-intentioned parents send her to group therapy, where she meets fellow cancer patient Augustus Waters. ""Gus"", played by the talented Ansel Elgort in only his third movie, is a plucky former athlete who, after a losing a leg to cancer, is determined to lead a happy life. They inevitably fall in love, and there are a few surprise touches in their story, yet after the crying stopped I didn't find anything solid underneath the movie. Maybe I am too cynical. Or maybe because I don't have a debilitating disease and don't have first hand information on how people behave with such knowledge playing in their minds. I had a problem with how Gus fixates on Hazel at their first meeting and decides to pursue her, in spite of her doing nothing of any interest in the meeting. The fact that Hazel returns the affection without any conflict doesn't exactly cover up for this glaring hole in the plan, but maybe something got lost in the almost-literal translation of the book to the screen. There is a kiss scene between Gus and Hazel in Anne Frank museum, which I thought was wholly inappropriate, given the setting. Gus comes off as a cocky smart mouth, as opposed to charming rogue, which did make me wonder why they didn't go with Miles Teller, who had great chemistry with Woodley in The Spectacular Now. Maybe because Elgort has the wholesome corn-fed American boy look done pat.Fortunately, the parents aren't portrayed as clueless impediments in the lives of their children, set up as a target of scorn and ridicule by the audience. The lovely Laura Dern plays Hazel's mother with great empathy, and along with Sam Trammel, who plays the father, makes the best of the thinly sketched characters. Nat Wolff makes the best use of his time as Isaac, Gus' best friend. Willem Dafoe interrupts the feel-good, non-conflict vibe of the movie as a reclusive and cranky author, and the beautiful Lotte Verbeek from The Borgias (2011-13) has a cameo as his assistant.If you are a connoisseur of Hollywood cinema, you know how the broad strokes of the story will go, and you will cry, laugh and cry again at the appropriate times, and hopefully that should be fine. Because that is the most I got out of this movie. Good performances all around, but a one-time watch is all I recommend. Maybe two, if you're hanging out with your Significant Other and wouldn't mind crying a bit.VERDICT: 6/10Go for Shailene Woodley."
" Simple!!

" Beautiful, beautiful movie
",2019-08-24 00:00:00,10,"I thought that it was going to be a typical made for television movie, maybe it is, I don't know, but it was so moving and beautifully well acted. I cried like a baby for most of it, so my best suggestion is to have, at least, one large box of tissues on hand."
" So beautiful!
",2019-08-12 00:00:00,9,"""This movie is beautiful"" I want to say this as much as gus said to hazel in the movie that she is so beautiful. I enjoyed the first half..it was cute...

After all, what matters in life...can be short or shorter...and after all, the importance is the presence of the feeling, the experience of it. What a profound theme...Facing what everybody avoids to look straight in the eyes! Glad that I had the privilege to find it in this sea of movies around!

" It was... fine.
",2019-06-10 00:00:00,5,"It was a decent movie to watch on a Sunday night I guess. The main problems here were that it was WAY too long. They could've accomplished the same movie had they cut 20-30 minutes off. There were also things that kind of got redundant between the two leads that kind of made the movie drag. The two main leads were really good but I didn't feel much for the relationship with the parents or their friends around them. That part of the story seemed like an afterthought.Had they shaved off some time of the movie, taken out the redundant interactions of the two protagonists, and added in some more of how their conditions were affecting everyone else around them I would've given this a solid 8 - but it's only a 5 from me for now. It's a good, albeit VERY depressing and morbid, movie."
" An OK teen RomCom/Sad Drama for a Sunday afternoon, tissues optional.
",2019-06-02 00:00:00,7,"When I read the reviews of this film I had the filter set to Helpfulness and I couldn't work out if this was the best film ever or the biggest steaming pile of excrement you will ever see. The first eight reviews were 9-8-10-9-8-10-9-10 and I was getting very excited but then suddenly, there were eight 1's in the next 12 reviews....hey? I saw reviews like this with The ""Before..."" trilogy (Sunrise, Sunset, Midnight), I loved those films but others just didn't get it and the 10's and 1's reflected that but I don't think this film falls into that category. At the time of writing this film is 7.7 which is sort of about right. We all have different scales and for me, anything over 7.8 falls into the pretty good category and over 8 into the very good...and so on. When leaving a review there really isn't anything that should get a 10 or a 1 as where can you go when something comes along that is better or worse? As it happens, this is mentioned in the film and it's not a spoiler to say that she describes her pain as a 9 because, well, it could be worse.So having got all of that out of the way, this film is a 7.7 which for me falls into the ""OK"" category. Shailene Woodley is the stand out actress with the rest just, meh, although Willem Dafoe's almost cameo appearance does add a bit of bite to it. My wife loves a good RomCom and is always reaching for the tissues and although she did again with this film, not as much as she usually does. I've shed a tear watching Cars, fought them back in the final scene of Pay It Forward and bawled my eyes out at.....well, you get the picture but not this time. I just wasn't moved enough by the performances or the script. This film is a little similar to Five Feet Apart which we watched yesterday and for me, I preferred that. Its rating is 7.1 which I feel is a little low and should really be a 7.7 with this film being 7.1. Anyway, It's OK without breaking any new ground and even the twists you could see coming and I found myself predicting the script a few times it was that generic. 7.1 for me."
" You will love this

" First review
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,7,"I think the movie was good, but some of it was too familiar with old movies, but I really enjoyed it and it made me think a lot about how fast your life can change, good and bad ( sorry for my english) not my number 1 language."
" The fault is in the script, but still beautiful nonetheless.
",2019-05-18 00:00:00,7,"First off, i hate to be that guy, I really do. The Fault in our stars, or TFIOS for short, really did play up the tumblr, edgy teen culture. For those who are familiar, will definitely understand. For those who can not fathom the utter confusion that is click clacking from my keyboard, let me explain.TFIOS really did have some questionable script writing and just weird, trying too hard metaphors. Augustus, the young boyfriend to fellow cancer patient and main character; Hazel, followed the cheap bad boy gone good image, topping it all off posing with a cigarette. Because, you know, it's definitely NOT to appeal to the edgy ""look at me, Im young and I smoke, i'm so deep"" scene.HOWEVER, the movie is good. very good. It's sad. Very sad. There's something oddly heartwarming about a young couple who fight through pain together. The pain in this story however is the fact the couple share cancer. Although, it indeed hide the gore and scars of the devastating disease, it needs to be remembered it is a love story, NOT primarily about having cancer.To keep in relatively short, Shailene Woodley (Hazel) great performance,, Ansel Elgort (Augustus) stole the show at the petrol station (you'll see) , Nat Wolf (Isaac) (Gus' friend) one touching scene, Parents (mum: Laura Dern, had great moments) (Dad: Sam Trammell, about as moving as a sleeping snorlax without the poke flute).I suggest watching this with plenty of tissues as this will make you cry. Too many times to count. The soundtrack complemented the movie very well and, in the end, shows that an egg on it's own may be repulsive, if you cook that with other ingredients, you get a lovely sweet cake, like this movie.The movie is sweet."

",2019-05-02 00:00:00,6,"Everyone really hyped this movie up, so I was excited to see it. But alas, it disappointed. It's not that it was bad, but it just wasn't as good as everyone made it out to be.The acting was fine, as were the directing and just about everything else in the movie. There just wasn't anything really great about it. Recommend only if you like teen dramas."
" Movie of The year for me
",2019-05-01 00:00:00,10,"So at first im a "" movie guy "" , i watched alot of movie through many years //

" A very lovely sad story
",2019-04-29 00:00:00,9,"I just wanna explain what I feel it's just like
A knife in our hearts 💔"
" Bring cyanid, lots and lots of cyanide
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,1,"Not a Good movie at all. Would be better off with way less money spent and be a Wallmark movie.
Its just a really bad movie about terminal teens falling in love....with a twist...oh wait, totally saw it coming."
" Good movie for sure, but too overrated for me...
",2019-04-19 00:00:00,6,"I'm not saying this is not a great movie, I mean sure a girl is sick and all, great storyline but it's just too much. There are tons of movies like that out there but somehow only this movie got famous and won awards. I feel like it could've been better...
Kind of a disappointment."
" Greatest movie
",2019-03-24 00:00:00,10,"Such a great movie, the movie allowed the audience to not feel pity for both of them. The only pity was at end of the movie. Such a great way to embrace falling in love in difficult situations. Both of the actors did such a great job at protraying their characters. Both of their acting matches up to the characters in the book. Which is perfect, their acting was great."
" Nice one
",2019-03-23 00:00:00,8,Amazing movie It was very nice watching this romantic drama .
" it is an emotional roller coaster
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,9,This has made me cry always regardless of the time I have watched this film.
" Apparently, the world is not a wish-granting Factory
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,10,"I totally liked this movie and chemistry between the two leads. It has all ups and downs, funny and romantic movie. This movie totally touhed my heart. It really is a 'One sick love story'."
" Favorite John Greene Film
",2019-02-12 00:00:00,10,"Most favorite story that John Greene brought to life that started from the book itself , the characters were played out terrifically to the point no other actor or actress wouldve did better than the ones chosen. Very beautiful and it brought me to tears at the end of it because of how real it felt."
" The saddest and at the same time the best movie I've ever seen!
",2019-02-11 00:00:00,10,"The fault in our stars is the story of two teenagers , Hazel and Augustus, with cancer who fall in love and decide to go to Amsterdam to realize Hazel's dream before her last breath but everything will not happen as expected...This movie is the saddest and at the same time the best movie I've ever seen! It's a drama and romantic film directed by Josh Boone, written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber. It was released on 2014. It is 2h06 min long, it may seen long but it's worth it. From the first minutes of the film we're caught in the story and it goes very quickly!The story is unbelievably beautiful. The music is incredibly well chosen! It conveys emotion. It makes us hang on the story and puts us in the character's place. Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort are perfect in the role of Hazel and Augustus. They convey their emotions.I've already read the book but I prefer the film. We cannot put ourselves in the place of the characters and we feel less emotions in the book.The fault in our stars is a movie that makes you think a lot and makes you cry. The story can really happen to us or to someone around you.I recommend this film at 100%."
" Shallowness with a halo
",2019-02-07 00:00:00,4,"I had very high hopes for this highly acclaimed film. After all, a mature theme (cancer), starring Shailene Woodley to boot (the girl from the Divergent series), what could go wrong, right?! This, to be precise: ""Gus jokes about his prosthetic leg, and they meet and fall in love at a cancer support group."" Because, yeah, they're not falling in love, are they?! It starts with Gus 'accidentally' bumbing into the girl: he doesn't immediately pull back, but keeps pressed against her. That's your first clue: that isn't love, but teenage lust (and severely lacking in subtlety, at that). Then enter the session room; the boy can't take his eyes off of her, literally, and 'Mr. swooney' himself keeps glancing at her, all the time, even when she tries and break eye-contact. She doesn't seem to mind (from anyone uglier, his behavior would, for sure, have evoked a #metoo moment). Then they go outside, and the boy keeps up his act, heavily coming on to her again, pulling out all the charm stops.At that point, I was already too disGUSted (pun intended) with the movie. Sure, Shailene Woodley is quite attractive (even with tubes up her nose), but this was not supposed to be flick about 'pretty girl meets handsome boy', was it? And yet, all the opening teenage lust ruins the premiss of the entire film for me, as it uses cancer as a disguise for what turns out to be just two attractive people instantly 'falling in love' (read: lust). And that undermines everything mature about this film, and only resoundingly underscores the shallowest message of all: a pretty boy meets a pretty girl -- despite their dismal circumstances masking it as something else. If the girl had been ugly -- or just mundane even -- and they'd still have fallen in love, that would at least have been something. As it was, though, it was just shallowness with a halo."
" A VERY good idea, but (ironically) not executed in an interesting way.
",2019-02-05 00:00:00,3,"It's ironic a movie written by someone who has spent time with cancer patients wouldn't have the movie resonate more completely. But for me, this one didn't. The movie is just kind of there, resting on the laurels that because its main characters have cancer we should automatically forgive for not being be as informative of the subject matter or entertaining as it could've been. I've known people who have died or suffered from horrible aflictions and a lot of little things about this movie felt false. And I felt bad because I like John and everytrhing he contributed to Crash Course series, and wanted to like this.If you remove the cancer component, it doesn't feel that interesting or real to me. I have a hard time believing that an author would be so horrible to these kids without more explanation and that someone as nice as his assistant would continue to work for him. Although I'm surprised she doesn't forgive him as his apology seemed extremely sincere.The crash course series in much more entertaining than this was. Movies like this I was hoping would have shown a greater responsibility to the people suffering from cancer and their families how better to cope, that may not know how. This is why I love the movie 6 weeks with Dudley Moore and Mary Tyler Moore.In this film, the adults felt the most real, entertaining and informative of how people might be dealing with a disease - her mom, dad, the author. Although it was nice to see the author of the book in the movie. For me this was the most interesting part.Nothing trivializes a movie's few good moments like a half-hazardly chosen songs as accompaniment to prop feelings. This is what the actors were actually for IMO."
" Great Movie, But it took an emotional toll on my life
",2019-02-02 00:00:00,7,"The plot of this movie is amazing. It makes you think one thing, but is really another (pipe shirt reference). It is incredibly sad so prepare yourself. Beautiful, but sad."
" The best film I've seen.
",2019-01-25 00:00:00,10,"The Fault in Our Stars is a 2014 American romantic tragedy film, directed by Josh Boone, based on the 2012 novel of the same name by John Green. The film stars Shailene Woodley, Ansel Elgort. Woodley plays Hazel Grace Lancaster, a sixteen-year-old cancer patient who is forced by her parents to attend a support group, where she meets and subsequently falls in love with Augustus Waters, another cancer patient, played by Elgort.Since childhood, Hazel has respiratory problems, forcing him to wear an oxygen tube continuously. On her mother's advice, she joined a support group where she met Augustus, who lost a leg to cancer. Charismatic and sure of himself, the young man quickly becomes close to Hazel, showing him the good side of things. He even manages to find the favorite writer of his new friend, planning a trip to Amsterdam to meet him.what i find most impressive about this film is the special effects that are absolutely sensational,and the caractersares are very convincing,The chemistry between Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elsort is astounding and the performances were astonishing.also it is beautifully written .This is the first movie this year that I have given a 10. I don't give out 10's easily, but there was seriously nothing wrong with this film. The pacing was perfect, the acting was phenomenal, the direction, editing and cinematography was exceptional and overall, this movie is one of the best romantic comedies that have ever touched the face of the earth. I encourage EVERYONE to go see this movie no matter what age you are and bring a packet of tissues as well. You'll need it."

" Simply heart touching
",2019-01-06 00:00:00,10,It was such a sad and emotional movie yet it had such an important and meaningful message that to live every beautiful moments of life. I simply loved this movie although I did not read the book yet.
" Not just like the book
",2019-01-06 00:00:00,9,"As one author thaught me; you can't expect the book the be as (good or bad as) the movie. They're two separate things, and one of them is just based on the other. If you go into the movie expecting a visualisation of the book, you're probably going to be disappointed. I believe the same counts for this movie, if you've read the book, please don't judge the movie like a visualisation. Please judge it as if the book was a guideline to something new.I thought the movie was awesome.Sincere; Dubnium"
" so so sad
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,10,"To all peaple who said it was awful,you dant have heart. how could you say?didnt you cry? you dont understand the pain was on me.it was touching all of your skin. the male acter. he was perfect. his acting was adorbale. so why someone has said he was awfule. he tried to hide his pain and show his smile to the girl. it was kinda acting and was so so Agonizing to see him when he was tring to smile"
" It's long, it's predictable, it's pretentious and has the saving grace of one cool character
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,4,"This was such a long overly dramatic movie which honestly felt like every other movie of the genera. Acting was fine but the dialogue was pretentious creating such fake characters. Anyone over 15 years old will predict every story beat that will come. The saving grace here is, unsurpringly, Willem Dafoe with his character being a grumpy drunk writer. The movie intends to prove him wrong but his character was so well done I couldn't help but agree with him more. I know this review will be unpopular but I just found this movie lacking any sense of reality to its characters and it's plot has been done so often."
" It might have been better with another main actress
",2018-12-23 00:00:00,4,"If I would like to say good thing on this movie or nothing, I say that everyone worked so hard to make a successful movie and touch people's feeling.
The effort of the main actress came through partially but her efficiency not at all.
With more talented young lady this movie could have made its mark.
Disappointment."
" Such a great movie..

" THE FAULT IN OUR STARS
",2018-12-02 00:00:00,10,"THE FAULT IN OUR STARS
THE MOVIE
Rated here as a ten intentionally because of the student unity towards having terminally ill patients on board like a student scholar with invalidity."
" Wretched
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,2,"A boring movie from beginning to end
patients and young children fall in love with each other"
" Tfios is pure love, pure perfection!
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,9,"Shailene and Ansel are irreplaceaple in this movie. This movie should be considered as a gold standard for the modern romantic genre. Dialogues are beyond beautiful. It is a lovely story told in a more beautiful way. Overall, it is a movie that will stay with us forever."
" grab a tissue
",2018-10-30 00:00:00,8,"The fault in our stars is about a young cancer patient called Hazel, her
mother is a very supportive character unlike her daughter who prefers to read in bed. Hazel agrees to go to a support group where she meets Isaac and Augustus, Isaac has a form of cancer in his eye and Augustus is a cancer survivor there for Isaac. Augustus and Hazel lock eyes on each other during the group session and start talking afterwards. Soon they become very close and learn to like the same things, Augustus emails one of Hazel's favourite authors and after much time debating, arguing and emails, Hazel and Augustus go to Amsterdam to meet the author, towards the end of the book Augustus and Hazel declare their love for each other but... plot twist. In a way they switch places, as Hazel gets a little bit better Augustus gets worse and then eventually...
My favourite character is Hazel because she has managed to overcome so much and still find love, travel, be a teenager and be able to live a longish happy life. Even when she was told ""no"" she managed to overcome the challenging time of surviving cancer, she is also a really caring character in the book. Hazel really makes you feel like if you try hard enough you can achieve whatever you want."
" This movie is like an onion explosive !!
",2018-10-16 00:00:00,10,"I usually dont cry during movies, but this one Daaamnnn, the tears came flooding outta my eyes and tbh it was the most heartbreaking movie I have recently came across over, no matter how many times you watch it, it still hit your heart the same everytime. Ok?"
" Pain demands to be felt
",2018-10-15 00:00:00,4,"This film was popular with young adults. My daughter when to an advance preview, the kind where you have a live by satellite Q&A session with the stars.As a parent you do end up questioning why would you want to see a romance movie about young people with cancer? In this case beautiful young people in a Hollywood movie. I had a sibling who had cancer at a young age, it was horrible, a nightmare and nothing like this movie.Hazel (Shailene Woodley) has cancer. She goes to a cancer support group where she meets Augustus (Ansel Elgort) a one legged cancer survivor. Both share an acerbic wit and an unconventional view of life. On a visit to Amsterdam to see a reclusive and alcoholic writer they fall in love.The fact that they have a kiss in Anne Frank's attic where a crowd applauds tells you all you need to know that this film has no taste.It starts off engagingly, like a stoic fight against the odds kind of movie with some black humour. It then becomes inert, really going nowhere, the narration becomes a nuisance and then the saccharine kicks in."
" Extremely sad and beautiful
",2018-10-04 00:00:00,10,"I read the book 'the fault in our stars' within the span of 2 days in middle school. I Enjoy the overall plot of the story, but I can't stand the fact John Green made it out as a more romantic storyline and that everyone plays it out to be a 'cancer story'. Now sure I will admit, some things are strongly cancer related, and I know most of the main characters have cancer. But I was going in as a person expecting it to be like 'Blue by Joyce Moyer Hostetter' and came out crying as it was more like an ironically more sad version of 'the hunger Games by Suzanne Collins'. Now, honestly, I loved this story, it caused me to feel an overwhelming amount of depression for a couple of days after reading it, and I honestly can say it has changed my life. It's made me respect the beauty of everything around me, so unless you want to change, I doubt you'll like not only this book, but the movie.
I have to (out of respect) remain quite about the sudden death of someone very important, but have to admit the part where she/he said, ""I lit up like a Christmas tree"" I cried. I've thought the plot of this story more than once over the duration of the past few days (since I've finished it) and I will say, there is no other plausible route for these characters to go other than down. At the beginning they were some-what normal, now their more than just depressed, they are conscious of their insurmountable feelings.
I would suggest this to hopeless romantics, and overall sad and depressed people."
" The saddest movie I've seen but the best movie
",2018-09-28 00:00:00,10,I feel the pain the story just loved everything in this movie go and watch this movie
" Boring .. far away from logic
",2018-09-26 00:00:00,2,"Way ita too long .. thing are happening very slow and it should be maximum 90 minutes 
I'm not understanding the goal and the plot
How she and gus met ohh god classic and boring way .. untill they arrived Netherland it was good .. but after that it start losing the way
I watched it with my fiancee so i had to pretend that im enjoying it .. 
People this movie is BAD .. end of story"
" Amazing, but completely sad
",2018-08-13 00:00:00,9,"When I first read the book, I thought that I had found my favourite thing in this world. But, a few days after that, when me and my best friend decided to watch the movie, I wasn't sure which one was better. Of course I believe that the books are always better than the movies, but the film made me cry, not the book. So, I decided that both of them are absolutely lovely.
About the plot of the film. It was just amazing, but completely sad. The ending was evil. At first, I thought that Hazel will be the one who will die ( I am not saying that I wanted her to die, I'm just saying what I was thinking), but the ending was completely different. I do not understand why in movies like this one, the romantic ones, the male character is always dying at the end. As you can see, I adore Augustus Waters.
Anyway, the movie is great. Everyone needs to watch it!"
" Really good
",2018-08-02 00:00:00,9,"The movie had a lot of parts in it that made me cry, but also very happy scenes. It was actually a really good movie"

" My tears goes to my two hours wasted ..
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,1,"Oh my gosh how on earth did a movie this bad get a rating so high.. I swear I am losing trust in the IMDB rating.. 
where do I start .. the Hazel thing was so unlikable.. so flat, unbelievable .. not for one second did I believe that she went through any pain.. let alone cancer ! 
The boy is so polished and perfect looking that he is not believable as a normal guy .. let alone an amputee ! And a cancer survivor!? And assuming he is virgin is just .. crazy at best ! 
The storyline is so fictional you can't engage ! Yeah right he gave his wish to a girl he didn't even kiss yet .. the doctor said A CLEAR NO , yet her mother took her .. despite the fact that she went to the emergency room shortly before that ! Am a mother and would never approve this . 
And as if it couybe crazier, they add the rude author thing .. who on the face of the earth talks like this to a sick girl who is enthusiastic about his book !?? And we never learn why ?! And if hebis so crazy why just why did the woman invite them ? And couldn't she at least moved the messy mail minutes before they came ? No just NO! 
And then they kiss , and people clap ? Why just why , then there was the love scene which was so boring I checked my instagram.. then the guy ( who doesn't have a single scratch on his face or not even a black under his eyes , not even a tired face) decides to tell her he is dying (despite looking strangly alive and spotless) .. she cries with artificial tears .. 
I have been in a cancer hospital, I have seen cancer patients.. I have seen people in pain, people dying .. They look nothing like that .. they talk nothing like that .. they are deep and painful to just deal with ..oh I can go on but I don't have time for this rubbish and it already stole two precious hours of my time.. its just that it was so bad I felt responsible to add my voice to those who have a sound mind !!! .."
" THis movie is in really poor taste
",2018-06-26 00:00:00,3,"When you first watch it, it seems like a perfectly harmless and sad tale...but look a little deeper. I mean first of all, cancer-stricken teens are not this HOT. And why is their death being romanticized? and why do they KISS IN THE ANNE FRANK HOUSE???? Sorry but you can do whatever you want to your fictional sick people, but Anne was a real person, and she wasn't sick, she was murdered, and using her memory as the BACKDROP for a romantic moment is disgusting. And why does everyone in the museum clap? So bizarre, borderline offensive, totally bland white people weepy."
" Sad
",2018-06-26 00:00:00,4,"It was painful, sad story and mom left our couch in the middle. I watched it all and cried terribly. I found again that how wonderful to love someone deeply
and that I do not have to be loved by everyone, which never happens. I will read the novel so that I will realize more things John Green tried conveying."
" Sad, but touching in a beautiful way
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,9,"I had cancer, so these movies hit me hard novadays. But the fact that the movie is sad doesnt make it any less good. Makes you hate the unfairness of fate, but still is meanungful and touching"
" PLEASE WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!
",2018-06-04 00:00:00,9,"I watched this after reading the book and expecting a lot out of it i was hoping that it would live up to my expectations but it didn't quite do it. it was a good movie but it lacked in quality, i wanted more context and more passion put into this movie i feel the director was lazy and didn't quite put enough effort into making it live up to the book version. nut overall it made me laugh and cry and left me wanting more."
" A must watch movie!
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,9,"Sympathetic turns by future stars Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort make this ""teenage cancer romance"" film rise above the likes of other teen aimed fare in its genre. The characters are well etched, and the dialogues are good- which is expected since it is an adaptation of a best-selling book by the same name. The author's complete participation in the production phase is one reason why the fault in our stars is not like other young adult book-based films- it is faithful to the source."
" A masterpiece !
",2018-04-22 00:00:00,10,"This film is a masterpiece because the story is profound and moving.

" A beautifully-crafted love story!!
",2018-04-05 00:00:00,9,"It's the first time, i ever felt like my heart completely immersed inside a movie with 
a heart wrenching dialogues.  
The story is extremely sad with a small twist and turns ,each character expressed there way of emotions well. I almost cried a lot through out the movie And some time this is all we need an eternal love to live in this small part of the universe."
" I cried

" A beautiful story that makes your own problems look very small
",2018-04-01 00:00:00,8,"I stumbled upon this movie while searching what to see on hotstar. The movie is a must watch for anyone who believes in love, or who thinks that their problems are unsolvable, or who feels that they are in midst of a crisis, or who feels that life is unfair towards them, or who believes that happiness has ceased to exist in their life. It is for all those people, for all those mortals who know that life is not unlimited. The month-or-so long story of Hazel and Augustus makes you fall in love with them. You wish you could help them but life has its own ways. It makes you happy, sad, and hopeful, all in the span of 2 hours. You may start loving your life more than before and enjoy the small things which were being ignored for so long. When death is inevitable, love and courage make it easy to embrace it."
" BORING
",2018-03-31 00:00:00,1,"This movie is identical to the book. Honestly, its a perfect adaptation. If you are a fan of bad acting, dull cinematography, cringey scripts, and the glamorization of deadly diseases, then you will love this movie. If you find any of those things to be boring or in poor taste, then I would recommend skipping this abomination."
" The saddest movie
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,10,"""The Fault in Our Stars"" is the saddest movie I have ever seen. Love, sacrifice, and hanging onto life were conceptualize through the sences of the movie."
" The Fault in Our Stars
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,5,"I saw the trailer for this movie, obviously it was marketed as a big tearjerker movie, the title comes from a quote from Julius Caesar by William Shakespeare, ""The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves, for we are underlings"", it basically means that the fault is in the lead characters stars, I hoped for something worth my time. Basically teenager Hazel Grace Lancaster (Divergent's Shailene Woodley) lives in Indianapolis, she has terminal thyroid cancer that has spread to her lungs. Her mother Frannie (Laura Dern) believing her to be depressed urges to attend a weekly cancer patient support group to make friends with people going through the same thing. There Hazel meets charging teenager Augustus ""Gus"" Waters (Baby Driver's Ansel Elgort), he lost his leg from bone cancer, but has since apparently been cancer-free, they bond at his house over their hobbies. They both agree to read each other's favourite book, Hazel recommends An Imperial Affliction, a novel about a cancer-stricken girl named Anna that parallels her experience, and Augustus gives Hazel Counter Insurgence. They keep in touch via text over the weeks that follow and grow closer, Gus expresses frustration when finishing the book, having an abrupt ending (it ends in the middle of a sentence), Hazel tells that the mysterious author Peter Van Houten (Willem Dafoe) retreated to Amsterdam after the book's publication, he has not been heard from since. Weeks later, Gus tells Hazel he has traced Van Houten's assistant, Lidewij (Lotte Verbeek), Hazel corresponds with Van Houten by email, she writes wanting to find out more about the novel's ambiguous ending, Van Houten replies that he is only willing to answer her questions in person. Hazel asks her mother if she can travel to Amsterdam to visit him, but Frannie refuses because of financial and medical difficulties, Gus suggests she uses her Make-A-Wish Foundation ""cancer wish"", but she has already used it to go to Disney World. Gus and Hazel go on a picnic date and begin to fall in love, he surprises her with tickets to Amsterdam, there is a medical setback, but Hazel's doctors allow the trip, they expect that she will soon become incapable of doing anything at all. Hazel and Gus arrive in Amsterdam, they have reservations at an expensive restaurant, paid for by Van Houten, during the meal, Gus confesses his love for Hazel.

Also starring True Blood's Sam Trammell as Michael Lancaster, Ana Dela Cruz as Dr. Maria, Randy Kovitz as Dr. Simmons, David Whalen as Gus' Dad and Milica Govich as Gus' Mom. Woodley gives a charming performance, whilst constantly wearing the breathing tubes, Elgort is endearing despite some cheesy dialogue, they are a believable doomed couple, obviously it is full of sentimentality and mushiness, and manipulative bits that try to draw tears, but it is also witty and amusing in the right places, it's not a bad romantic drama. Worth watching!"
" Funny and heartbreaking
",2018-03-02 00:00:00,8,"Really great adaption of the young adult novel. Enjoyed this one a lot. Funny and heartbreaking. Shailene Woodley & Ansel Elgort are fantastic, seeming very comfortable with each other and are addictive to watch, you don't want their story to end.We follow them from their meeting in a cancer support group and through their whirlwind romance which takes them to Amsterdam to meet the very nasty Willem Dafoe, a reclusive and mostly drunk author of a book that has touched their lives. Ultimately this trip teaches both of them what it means to truly be alive.Willem Dafoe plays the bad man to perfection, Laura Dern as the mother is great. This teen romance felt very mature to me because of what they've both faced. Worth a watch even if your not a teen but be warned, you'll feel kinda wrecked afterwards."
" Some infinities are bigger than other infinities !
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,8,"The fault in our stars is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's a love story of two teenagers attacked by a cancer, Hazel and Augustus who met and fell in love at a cancer support group.
On one hand the film make us discover the pain of cancer patients and the suffering of their families, on the other hand, it show us a pure love that go beyond all the difficulties of life.
The outstanding performance of the actors Shailene Woodly and Ansel Elgort make us feel the characters as if they were real.
The soundtracks extracted by different fantastic romantic songs, make the scenes rich of beautiful emotions.
 The plot is very good written, it transmits a lot of ideas, of a pure love that goes beyond the limits such as an infinity.
I invite the lovers of romance movies to watch the film, It deserves to see."
" ROMANTICALLY EXHILARATING! INGENIOUSLY STUNNING! MONUMENTALLY HEARTBREAKING!
",2018-02-20 00:00:00,7,"I'll be the first to admit that romantic comedies are not usually my cup of tea. But as a genuine cinephile I will honestly say that out of hundreds of the ROMCOM'S I've sat through when trying to accommodate a past, present or future potential girlfriend I would come across some that were quite mesmerizing every now and then. With that being said, sophomore director Josh Boone's romance epic ""THE FAULT IN OUR STARS"" is easily one of best films of (2014).
From its infectiously raw opening scene to an incredibly heart breaking ending director Josh Boone's heartfelt drama is a magnificently endearing love story. 
Even though the film may seem to be only targeting teenage audiences by concentrating entirely on the lives of just two teenagers, it's a conquest for love that's remarkably original with a roller coaster of emotion elevating throughout all while including some of the strongest acting I've seen in (2014)."
" So little time
",2018-02-19 00:00:00,8,"If you think that The Fault In Our Stars is just another teen romance are you in
for a pleasant surprise. You'd better have a good supply of tissues because this
film involves two very special teens. Ansel Elgort and Shailene Woodley are a
pair of cancer survivors and they just haven't got very much time.With Woodley she's come through cancer of the thyroid and she has the breathing
apparatus as just part of her person now. Her parents naturally worry about 
over straining herself, but Woodley is determined to lead as active a life as she
can.At a cancer survivor support group she meets Ansel Elgort who has really made
quite a name for himself since this film came out. Elgort is a former basketball star who lost a leg to cancer. He is so incredibly quirky and charming in this
part I'm surprised he didn't get Oscar consideration.The two make a trip to Amsterdam to visit an author they admire. Willem Dafoe however has less than meets the eye, still they have a good time. When
they visit the Anne Frank house the symbolism is certainly not lost on the
viewer.The title is a play on Cassius's famous quote from Julius Caesar about the fault
not lying in our stars but in ourselves. There's no fault here for Woodley an
Elgort. Fate has dealt them a cruel and rotten hand and they have to make the most of it.I haven't seen a film move me as much since Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby. Even a Medusa would be reduced to tears with this one."
" Best Romance Movie Ever
",2018-02-17 00:00:00,10,"This is the best Romance Movie That i ever seen,
You Can't live .. if you don't watch this"
" An incredibly dramatic masterpiece
",2018-02-07 00:00:00,10,"A terminally ill girl suffering from lung cancer meets a boy with a very difficult condition of his own who is about to change her life forever. A very close friendship is born between the two but it will not remain as such for long. As they spend more time together and understand each other's situation, their relation evolves, making the final part of their life more than bearable. As a final wish, he takes her to Amsterdam to visit the author of her favorite book but their adventure will not be without obstacles as illness never sleeps.It's a movie which follows the lives of two teens, deeply traumatized by their condition, who manage to find comfort in each other's arms, struggling every day not to lose faith. Their drama is presented in great detail, from the moment they first met, going all the way to Amsterdam in search of answers regarding their book. We're faced with two very complex characters, very well designed and described, not to say how they're excellently played by their respective actors, who transmit a plethora of emotions, making themselves extremely pleasant throughout the movie, despite their illness. You're bound to burst into tears many times throughout, as you'll find it extremely hard to see their struggle.The plot is very well designed, managing not to be predictable or linear, bringing something new and quite unexpected with every occasion it gets. The unique atmosphere it creates simply draws you into it, keeping you attracted, interested and curious about the faith of the two. It generates plenty of drama and thrill along the way, but also raises the mood and even makes you laugh once in a while. The end to their story is as unexpected as it is tragic and sentimental, but in a good way. I cannot express the emotions I felt during this movie, every single word simply being insufficient in providing any explanation.Overall, it is very dramatic but at the same time it brings laughter when you least expect it and romance in its purest way. This movie can cause a lot of tears but it will also bring warmth in one's soul if he or she lets it. It's simply breath taking in every aspect, from its gorgeous story to its presentation, cast and finale. Make sure you don't miss this wonderful masterpiece!"

" Not best than the book, but another whole experience
",2017-11-23 00:00:00,9,"The Fault in Our Stars is a world-known book written by the best- seller author John Green. The movie was released after two years of the book's debut, in 2014. A lot of people may say the book is incredibly better than the movie, and I will agree in some parts, but the movie is actually a sweet rom-com that will make everyone want to fall in love after watching it.First of all, the choice of actors was extraordinary. They thought really carefully about how faithful it could be and tried their best. Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort make the perfect couple as Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters, their chemistry is tangible. Concerning the plot, I had my worries about straying too far from the book, but they just nailed the adaptation. John Green himself kept up with the recording of the movie and that says something about the truth of the movie.Besides being similar to the book, the movie is well-written and has nice photography. In addition, the scenarios are very beautiful and well-chosen. Also, the soundtrack fits perfectly the kind of romantic and sad story that is being narrated, and it makes you feel way more emotional about everything. I thought about this movie a lot after leaving the movie theater and I couldn't decide if I was angry or happy about the movie being so good. I know a bunch of people criticize a movie that doesn't have a complex and deep background, but this movie is the perfect movie to watch by yourself at home on a Friday night. You will get involved with the lives of such innocent characters, who believe in love and who can fight everything to have a little piece of it.If you're wondering about the story itself, I can tell you something to make you want to watch the whole movie. So, it's kind of a simple love-story, except the main characters have cancer and they're just teenagers, which just make you more immersed in their universe. Other than that, the quotes you get from this movie makes you want to go to your diary and write them down. Plus, along with the heartbreaking love that Hazel and Augustus live together, there are lessons about friendship and family and how it is great to be surrounded by people who care about you. With all that in mind, I think people will hate this movie or absolutely love it, and I'd much prefer if they do love it. Maybe it is just another romantic movie, but, I mean, who doesn't love romantic movies, right?"

She introduces Augustus to her favourite book and he forms a plan in which they will travel to Amsterdam together to meet the author of the book and find out what happens after the book's end. They are able to take this trip, but it has an unexpected end. At the end of the trip, Augustus says to Hazel that his cancer has come back and it's much worse than the previous time. They return home and a lot of sad events has happened. I forgot to say that they were very in love and loved each other very much.This film made me very nervous and made me cry about 3 times because of their so sad life story.I recommend this film to everyone. It must be seeing once in a lifetime."
" I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity

It might also be one of the most charming films I've ever seen ..""How dare you say that about a film based on cancer"" Well unlike its counterparts TFIOS actually has a brain and a heart and might just be one of the best films of the 21st century. Its not depressing but rather a story about falling in love and living each day to the fullest. Even If someone has a heart made of stone I'm sure it will be shattered as they watch this beautiful and moving story"
" Oblivion is inevitable - still I want my name to go long in history!
",2017-10-10 00:00:00,9,"Tone, Script & Story: I have watched the movie twice. The first time was a long time ago. I will discuss what I remembered from first time – first. It was as if how two in-completes meet each other to build something which is complete. What else I remembered from story did not show exactly same the second time. It was as if Hazel while attending the funeral explained how happy go lucky stud Gus, fell in despair in his last days (I mean even the strong ones deteriorate). While watching second time, there's nothing like this. Instead what is shown apart from coming together is that they visit Amsterdam to her favorite writer and spent some good time. In short the funeral scene were as if got replaced.Apart from the story mentioned above what I most liked is how Gus wants him to be remembered in world and how Hazel mentions truly loved by someone,even if the only person, is more than enough as oblivion is inevitable. I stand with Gus on this one (4/5).Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Each of direction, screenplay and cinematography is very good. (4/5).Music: Music is very good as well (4/5).Acting: Acting is very good as well (4/5).Final Verdict: It is worth adding to your DVD collection [(4/5) (9/10)]."

I cud have missed this wonderful romantic movie with all you 2* 3* etc ratings. U cud have watched lots of romantic movies with good ending or sad ending but only few movies ill leaves scare in your heart even after the movie this that kind of movie. Actually i don't wanna to blame those idiots who rated low. Cos love cant be buy or thought if have it inside u u ill definitely love this movie
" Why do people like this movie?
",2017-09-17 00:00:00,1,"I have no idea why people enjoyed this movie. It was booooooring! if I have to make a comparison, I will compare this movie with ""Me, Earl and the Dying Girl"" ... watch both movies side by side, both have similar stories, but ""Me, Earl and the Dying girl"" is executed beautifully and it keeps you engage. While this movie? BOOOOORINGOkay it started good, and then it just kept on pushing to be boring. Hazel Grace, I felt she is selfish. Yes I know it sucks to have Cancer, but it's not just you who is suffering but people around you are in the boat. And to be honest, since they introduced ""GUS"" I knew he is going to die at the end, one way or another. So there was no mystery there..I really recommend you to watch ""Me, Earl and the Dying Girl"" Trust me, it will bring tears to your eyes and it is refreshing. Unlike ""the fault in our stars"" Sorry.. but this is what I feel.. and it is too long! should be around 1 hour 10 minutes..."
" Positive and Inspirational
",2017-07-27 00:00:00,8,"Based on a worldwide best selling novel, the Fault in Out Stars made a severe impact with audiences and helped elevate Shailene Woodley's career to the next level. Fans of the novel having many doubts as to how the film would compare and share with the novel. Compared to 'the Notebook', this film is quite arguably better and features arguably better writing and refreshing performances from its leads Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort showing great chemistry.A major reason why this film is as praise is due to the positive message, sensitivity of the issues and characters and the authentic feel of the film. In many romance drama teen films, there are silly and over the top forced comedy and they come off as cheesy. This film although deals with a serious matter, plays out in a relatively lighter tone and it works. Featuring likable characters, a clean and good pace, the Fault in Our Stars is quite an interesting tale and better than one expected."
" To truly be happy, you need to shed a few tears..
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,10,"While watching this movie, I got reminded of Sadness from Inside Out - to really experience joy, one also needs to go through some emotional troughs. And boy I was feeling a wave of happiness running through my body, with every passing frame of this movie. And it was Aristotelian happiness: eudaimonia!The movie is based on a book of same title - it's a tale of two teenagers, both battling through cancer and how courageously they decide to put themselves out there - vulnerable to love, and become wiser and stronger through their bond. A charming and humorous narrative, with big jolts of reality. And it makes you cry. I don't remember if I've ever cried so much in any movie.The characters are earnest and the soundtrack amplifies all emotions very eloquently. But it also makes one feel really blessed.One of the best movies I've ever seen."
" A few faults, but on the whole fine
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,3,"This book touched many millions of teenage hearts around the world, so it's not surprising then that eventually Hollywood came calling wanting to adapt John Green's words to film.And it's an honest attempt actually. Yes, there are slight changes, there has to be really, but on the whole this is a well made, and well acted film, that will bring more people's attention back to the book, which is not a bad thing at all.It's not the best book adaptation in the world, but it captures the message of the original, and I have no doubt will become as beloved.Not bad at all."
" A fault indeed
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,3,"I'm gonna be real, I don't watch many romantic movies so I'm not an expert in the Romance genre. I gave this movie 3 stars for argument's sake, I don't wanna be completely biased when I knew what I was getting myself into. That being said...This movie was all the rage when it came out and my friends were peer pressuring me to go see it so we did. I honestly couldn't care less whether Hazel lived or died or her whole ordeal (as cold-hearted as that may sound) because she's an obnoxious, selfish, self-centered spoiled brat. She goes as far as telling her parents she knows they won't get over her probable death and basically their whole lives would be over, to which they basically replied ""nah mate we cool"" (understandably so). I also don't think cancer patients look that healthy or athletic (ie Gus), but what do I know? The only character that I felt was in touch with reality is the writer, but of course angsty teen princess Hazel wants none of this BS. How dare he tell her to get over herself?! I don't even wanna touch the scene where they go to Anne Frank House, because it'll make me reconsider my 3 stars rating and I'm struggling to keep an open mind about this movie. I really am. If a movie about a bunch of spoiled brats is supposed to make us sympathize with them just because they have cancer, then I guess I'm cold as ice."
" Sentimental and miserable wallow in cancer & death
",2017-05-06 00:00:00,2,"This romantic drama film is about a teenage couple in the Midwest who are both dying of cancer. This sentimental film is very disappointing - I don't know why it's so popular. It was misleadingly promoted as a film in which the main characters enjoy fulfilling, happy lives in spite of their bad health. It's actually a feel-bad film about cancer and death. Why did they cast a plain girl as Hazel? It would have been much more powerful if they'd cast a beautiful girl, who loses her looks as she becomes more seriously ill. I can see that the makers of the film were aiming it at teenage girls by having a plain protagonist get a tall, handsome, older boy who's out of her league. However, by doing so they've made the relationship unrealistic and the film unappealing to the rest of the population. They also made the mistake of having her no more or less ill at the end of the film than she is at the beginning of it.Eighteen-year-old Gus tells Hazel that he's a virgin. It's highly unlikely that a lad who's tall and of significantly above-average looks would reach 18 without having intercourse, even if he has a false leg. Even if he were that unfortunate, he wouldn't admit it to a girl whom he's sexually attracted to - because she'd laugh at him and never want anything more to do with him. Hazel is surprised, but not bothered. They have sex together once, but we don't find out whether or not she'd previously had sex with anyone else.The Amsterdam portion of the film is very disappointing. Hazel is inexplicably angrily disappointed about a novel ending abruptly and travels to Amsterdam (four thousand miles away), to meet the author. They go for three days - who makes an eight thousand mile return trip for such a short time?! This reclusive author pays for these two strangers to him to have dinner in an upmarket restaurant and then welcomes them into his house. However, he then angrily rebukes Hazel for criticising the end of the novel in question. In the restaurant, the teen couple pretend to the staff that they're married. This is totally unnecessary in present day Amsterdam - a very sexually liberal city! In any case, very few teens in the Western World are married. They're only in Amsterdam for two or three days, during which they choose to go to the Anne Frank House - but don't even suggest going to the red-light district! Are these the most boring teens in the world?! At Gus' funeral, Hazel is introduced as his ""special friend"". Who the hell uses that term in modern America when referring to young, heterosexuals who are in a sexual relationship?! The usual term used - even by prudes - is girlfriend.We never find out anything about the two main characters lives before they had cancer. The film would have been better with some flashbacks to that, to give us more context and background of what their lives were like then."
" The Fault in Our Stars: Review
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,9,"The Fault In Our Stars is a film directed by Josh Boone based on the John Green novel of the same name (The first time his novel is adapted to a film). Now let me confess I am not a person who see's romantic films. I would rather watch films of action genre. Even when I read a one line summary about the film I wasn't ready to see it. Because I thought it would be overly melodramatic. But then many people said me it's actually not that. And when I saw the film I thought how wrong I was. Plot: Hazel and Augustus meet at a support group and fall in love with each other.Story: If you see the film, in the very first scene only you get a hint at the ending of the film (I actually guessed the ending of the film and YES I WAS RIGHT). The story has basically nothing new in it. The setting is little bit changed to 2 people who are actually battling for their life. I also began to guess some of the scenes. Which is the only ""fault"" in this film. But still I was feeling joyed and excited in every scene that I was seeing. That is the magic of the screenwriters and directors. They create a world in which you love to swim. That is why the film actually caught hold of me (even though I knew most of the scenes). There are many things that differed from the novel. But I will highlight the 2 which I thought were important: 1) Ansel died quite quickly in the novel. 2) Hazel forgives van Houten during the funeral scene. The reason I highlighted these 2 things is because I liked the way these two things were not shown in the film. Because actually the essence of the film quite die.Now since I saw an extended version of the film, I would actually give light on some of the scenes that was not in the theatrical version: 1) The first would be the scene where Hazel tells her Mom that Gus is ready to take her to Amsterdam and after the scene they go to the doctor to ask for permission which she declines. I guess this was quite important to show the care of the mother for her child. 2) Another one is toward the end where Hazel takes Gus to the hospital and on the way she recites the poem ""The Red Wheelbarrow"". This scene is too important as it tells more about how strong is the relation between Gus and Hazel.Acting: Shailene Woodley is actually the main protagonist of the film. She did an excellent job as Hazel. As the director had said once, Within ten or fifteen seconds of Shailene's audition, I knew she was Hazel. She held up her script pages and just her eyes were peeking over them."" I couldn't see anyone as more convincing as her. I would also say the very same statement for Ansel (as Augustus). He too was very good. William Dafoe as the alcoholic author was great. And the rest of the supporting cast too especially Laura Dern as Hazel's Mother. She killed it with the emotions as a mother whose child is suffering.Favorite scene: I guess it would be the scene where Hazel and Gus meet after the support group session for the very first time. Then Gus puts a cigarette in his mouth and Hazel is surprised. The reply to Hazel in that scene was actually something that grasped and fascinated me a lot.Verdict: I loved the film a lot. As I said, the only ""fault"" in the film is that I have seen things like these many times. But still I enjoyed the film. SO I would give it a 9/10."
" Will Hold Your Interest Even If You Don't Get Into The ""Sad Stuff""
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,6,"When I sat down to watch ""The Fault In Our Stars"", I was worried that it would be nothing but a ""kleenex box flick"". Much like guys can be drawn to the theater with the right quota of explosions, special effects, and superheroes, the same can often be said for women only with really sad stories. That is kind of how this movie is marketed too...as a real tear-jerker. Luckily, the film does enough besides the ""waterworks"" moments to keep your interest throughout. It isn't just all sadness and crying.For a basic plot summary, this movie focuses on Hazel (Shailene Woodley), a teenager living with a rare form of cancer that makes her (in her own words) a ""ticking time bomb"". At a cancer support group (that Hazel usually loathes, of course), she meets Gus (Ansel Elgort), a fellow youngster who also happens to have a less-severe form of cancer. The two strike up a conversation, which leads to a friendship, which leads to a romance. Through a mutual interest in a mysterious author (played by Willem Dafoe), Hazel, her parents (played by Laura Dern & Sam Trammell), and Gus go off on a ""last wish"" adventure to find this author and have him explain the ending of his most famous book.I won't go into any spoilers on what makes this movie so ""sad"", but when you consider it is about two kids with cancer, you can probably put two and two together. If you are into emotional speeches and heart-stirring (for better or worse) scenarios, then you will indeed need a tissue box handy. However, even a 28-year old male like me was able to sit through the film without rolling my eyes or tuning out. Though coated with adolescent angst and high-profile teen actors, the kernel of emotion transferred from the core of the story (although I have not read the book, so I can't get into the differences) to the big screen remains poignant.""The Fault In Out Stars"" probably gets a bit of a ""bum rap"" right now because the general market is so saturated with these types of stories. I kind of compare it to ""The Giver"" in that regard. Yet, one must remember that is was John Green's book that practically STARTED this entire genre; it just took awhile for it to get transferred to Hollywood.On my personal ranking scale this movie would get a 3.5-star ranking, but I'll bump it up to four stars here because it is a touching story with even a little comedy and light-heartedness thrown into the mix. While the core of the story may be very emotional, it isn't all ""doom and gloom""."
" Great film to sit through, if the pretentiousness doesn't get you first.
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,7,"There are already hundreds of reviews for this film praising it as some beautiful and heartbreaking journey between two kids in love, and you know, those reviews are right. The Fault in Our Stars is absolutely incredible. If you want hours and hours of text going over how absolutely incredible it is, it's not too difficult to find the 10-star reviews. This is in my opinion a pretty good film with a lot to offer.It's also incredibly pretentious. Its beginning introduction narrated by Hazel tells you that ""movies should tell the truth instead of romanticizing terminal illness"". And then it does exactly what it says movies shouldn't do, all while introducing two young adults who talk as though they're reciting poetry every time they open their mouths. If you really want the truth, people don't speak this way or act this way. Augusten was the most annoying character in a film I've ever come across in a long time. Every normal conversation between him and Hazel dissolves into geeky pop culture references, video games and philosophical musings. His pseudo-intellectual routine yet childish attitude just makes him seem ridiculous. Hazel herself is so apathetic that it's simply unrealistic. They have many wonderful on-screen moments together, but the pretentiousness got on my last nerve every time. The similar 2003 film 'My Life Without Me' (also about a girl dying from cancer and falling in love) did it the right way, showing real human beings without watering them down under nerd culture and lame jokes.The great moments in this film however far outweigh the lousy ones. Issac, who has gone blind from retinal cancer, is perhaps the most realistic of any of the characters in the film. He bring initial comic relief to the story and later on profound sadness. Augusten does often drop the show-off attitude and prove himself to be an excellent person, whether taking Hazel on picnics to an enormous artists' rendering of a skeleton, to getting her on a tour to meet her favorite author in Amsterdam which strays from its route and ends up becoming a tour of Anne Frank's house. There's a lot of value to The Fault in Our Stars as a film in general, however the ending is very harrowing and this is not a story for everyone. It's going to be a magnificent masterpiece for some viewers, and a morose kick in the pants for others. Either way, whichever side of that spectrum you happen to fall on, this is still a story worth pursuing."
" a powerful story
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,8,"wow, such great acting and such great and simple dialogue. The characters have such great chemistry. I love that in this story that you got to see the characters grow to being friends into loving each other. The characters really care about the people that they are portraying and they try to be as real and authentic as possible. This is such a sweet and great love story. Spoiler Warning: The ending to this movie is so rough and so hard. We all know that he is gonna die but when it happens you can't help but feel so empty and heartbroken. The Ed Sheeran song to this movie alone is so sad as well. I love this movie and I want to read the book and compare both. such great acting and Shailene is such a talented actress."
