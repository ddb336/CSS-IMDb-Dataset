" Boring
",2021-04-02 00:00:00,3,Have to blame the writers not the actors there was a pitiful lack of emotion by the characters and absolutely nothing to draw the viewer to the true story of the Lovings. May have been a landmark case but it was also a landmark failure in its portrayal of such an emotional case.
" A quiet movie about the struggle for civil rights
",2021-03-31 00:00:00,9,"To be honest the title of ""Loving"" did mislead me a little bit. I thought it was derived from ""love"", but in reality it is the surname of the married couple Richard (played by Joel Edgerton) and Mildred (played by Ruth Negga) Loving. This couple was the subject of a landmark decision by the American Supreme Court from 1967 in which the miscegenation laws of the State of Virginia (and other States of the Unites States) were declared to be contrary to the American constitution.""Loving"" is therefore a film about the struggle for civil rights in America (despite my wrong interpretation of the title I was aware about that before I watched the movie). There are many movies about this subject and given the black lives matter movement of today (2021), they remain topical. In many of this movies there is horrible violence, often perpetrated by the KKK. Take for example ""Mississippi burning"" (1988, Alan Parker).Saying nothing to the detriment of ""Mississippi burning"", but ""Loving"" is different. Very different. It does not boil over with outrage, because it assumes (rightly so) that is does not have te explain that racism is a very bad thing. It does not have fysical violence, only legal violence in the form of the State of Virginia maintaining crazy miscegenetaion laws. It does not have heroes, only two people loving (there he is) each other who just want to be left alone.There are two lawyers eager to go to the Supreme court (which eventually they did), but they are certainly not the heroes of this movie. Their relationship to the Loving couple is complex. The Loving couple are their clients but sometimes they put their clients at risk for the higher goal.The real heroes of the movie are Richerd and Mildred Loving. Jeff Nichols could have made a courtroom drama about this landmark case, he did not do it. He made a quiet film without big emotional outbursts and that was exactly in keeping with the spirit of the main characters.There is one scene at the Supreme court and some reviewers label this unnecessary. Maybe they are right, but it is only a little error in a flawless film. Flawless also because of the two lead actors."
" excellent, poigniant
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,10,"This film is excellent, poigniant, and important.I guess there are a lot of people who can relate with Mr. Loving and his wife.I have never understood racism. It is a bizarre and horrible thing that such primitive and inhumane sensibilities even still existed in the 1960's as portrayed in the film.I applaud the actors and the crew for this important story.The acting was extremely good, especially of the two leads. The show of emotion, the manner of communication, and the persinalities of rhe two leads, was all beautiful and poigniant. I watched many of those moments several times because they were so well done. You can see their inner feelings.Every other aspect of the style of this film in regards to writing, direction, amd acting, was excellent and was exactly what it needed to be."
" Great film on a true story
",2021-02-25 00:00:00,10,Loves this depiction of 1950s America and the obvious racism that existed in many states. Highly recommend this film
" Small story, giant impact
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,8,"Our family watched this film in honor of (a) Valentine's Day, (b) Black History Month. Best. Choice. Ever. Nichols once again proves adept at writing small town characters, showing rather than telling, and finding moments of powerful silence along the way. This film stays faithful to the historical record, but focus matters. In lesser hands, this movie would have become a legal drama about white lawyers, but Nichols makes it a story about a small town relationship (and the community around them). That choice to focus on characters of color, to let complexity emerge from small town folks, makes all the difference. By the time the Lovings put their arms around each other, that simple act is as powerful as it gets. THAT is storytelling."
" This is different than what I expected but the differences made for a stronger film
",2020-11-30 00:00:00,10,"I had expected this to be primarily a courtroom drama given that it is based on one of the most important Supreme Court cases in history (Sidenote: If Amy Coney Barrett was consistent in her originalism she must say Loving v. Virginia was decided wrong. But she isn't so she won't). Now the legal proceedings are part of the film but the nuts and bolts of the case are almost entirely ignored. i.e. the big argument before the S. Court is about 10 sentences and you don't see any of the appeal process. There's maybe 10 minutes (in 2 hours) in a courtroom and maybe 15 minutes with lawyers. So the legal drama is de-empathized. Instead the film focuses on the interpersonal struggles of the Lovings.A ton of the film is just about the love the Lovings shared; the movie more easily fits into a romance than a legal drama. The film is about the inner turmoil of Richard and Mildred face because of the oppressive miscegenation laws as well as the day to day practical impact imposed on their lives. But it also shows them struggling with basic domestic duties, i.e. children, work and being conflicted (especially Richard) with the public attention the case brought. Overall the film dramatizes the *personal* aspects of the *political* situation.A lot of films based on real life incidents or figures that were pivotal to social movements can end up stuffy, stilted. I.e. The Help, The Butler, A Beautiful Mind etc. They all end up being Important Subject Movies-this is can be rousing enjoyable filmmaking but Nichols' subdued film is a lot better than that. The film trusts the viewers to feel the oppression and the injustice without spelling it out. The film several times require the viewer to make (a simple straightforward) deduction to make sense of a sequence or scene. This level of restraint is impactful because of how authentic it is.A lot of people praise the lead actors-they are both *wonderful*-but I think the nuanced, humane portrayal as a lot more to do with the scripts' focus and the directions minimal and naturalistic style. This is a wonderful rebuke of the hatred that Trumpianism has unleashed in the world; best of all it doesn't feel preachy. It is a love story in the end."
" Great story, slow movie
",2020-11-17 00:00:00,6,A great story of love and perseverance. The characters were well cast and well acted. My only complaint is that the movie was very slow. Lots of filler scenes.
" Tedious, too long and devoid of tension
",2020-10-27 00:00:00,3,"This film was a lost opportunity. This was a storyline based on fact and great legal historical significance. But it was in large parts like watching paint dry. Joel Edgerton's acting was flat, lifeless and for me irritating. His character's wife Mildred was far more superior but even here, the director missed opportunities to bring the character to life and engage the audience more.
The word I would use to sum up this film at the end is disappointing. Not recommended."
" For a movie about such an important topic, it feels pretty empty when it comes to emtion.
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,6,"It's slow, quiet and oddly distant. I think that's kind of the point. It protrays the Lovings as a very unassuming couple. They didn't care about all the lawer side of the supreme court case, they just wanted the veredict to let them stay together, because they loved each other.That's the film's biggest strength and weakness. The relationship between these two is very sweet and you can tell they love each other. However, I was left a bit dissappointed when it came to the importance of landmark case.The film focuses more on the Lovings as a regular couple that just so happens to be interracial, which is great. But by focusing mostly on this, it deprives the audience from witnessing just how important the case as a whole was, since most of it happens off-screen. Making the film a courtroom drama would have been the wrong move, but more courtroom scenes would have been welcome.Still though, their relationship is lovely and Ruth Negga and Joel Edgerton give great and very understated performances, so the final product is defintely worth watching. I just wished it could have had a bigger emotional impact. I love subtle, understated movies, but sometimes it's just nice to feel things, you know?I will say this however; I certainly did not expect Michael Shannon to show up. Then again, this IS a Jeff Nichols movie, so I probably should have."
" LOVED IT
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,8,"A poignant, low key and beautifully made movie on a subject that is very very relevant today in the divided USA. Edgerton and Negga give masterful performances. Nichols keeps the pace and tone in excellent balance.Highly recommended to Trump supporters."
" Painterly and poignant.
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,8,"""Loving"" is a film of quietly poignant performances and painterly images. There's a ravishing shot late in the film, where Richard stands on his porch in the cold winter air looking over at an offscreen character, the magic hour bathing him and the snowy background in wondrous golds and violets. It about took my breath away.Ruth Negga is really, really good here. Her gentle, expressive eyes ply you with soft assertiveness. She bathes the frame in maternal love and care. It's no wonder she can get just about whatever she wants out of Richard. She gives probably my favorite female performance of the year so far.Joel Edgerton is better than I've ever seen him. He disappears behind the image of Richard Loving, a quiet, simple, private man who's silently frustrated that no one will just let him and his family be.On the other hand, the film feels a bit too plodding, and while Richard and Mildred's relationship is portrayed beautifully and delicately, their roles as parents weren't given as much attention as I would have liked. Unfortunately, they come across as a little ornery and distant as parents, which I don't think is at all the film's intention. There are great moments, to be sure, as when Richard's kids pull him away from working on a car to horse around with them. But I felt that aspect of their lives needed just a little more attention.This is a very good film. I just wasn't quite as emotionally enraptured as I had hoped."
" Peculiarly emotionally distant
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,6,"Given how important this true story is in American history and how emotive the subject matter, I found myself strangely unengaged emotionally by this film. It's as if the director was so determined to avoid sentimentality that he left out heart. I feel I may have been more engaged had we met the couple earlier in their love story. Meeting them as an established couple gave me no idea how they met or what sort of troubles they must have had as a new couple, facing their families and their community. And I felt we learnt very little about their families in the course of the film. Nor did we learn much about the other supporting characters like the racist policeman or the civil rights' lawyers. There was also quite a time jump in the middle of the film from the couple having their first child to suddenly having lots of them. I just felt the film did not tell the story well. It certainly looked great but I worried that the director was more concerned with getting the period detail right than telling the story."
" A sweet film
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,7,The character of Richard was fugly but the actress playing Mildred was beautiful! Too long and the dialogue of Richard was mumbled and non sensical!
" Happy Loving Day !
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,9,"Today 53 years ago, the Lovings were the couple that made it possible for interracial couples to be together. I watched this movie as an assignment for history and fell in love with it, it's so eye opening and heartwarming and the fact that it's a true story makes this movie even more beautiful!"
" Beautiful
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,10,"The only way we will ever get rid of racism, is if everyone mixes together.
This is a beautiful story of love.
The acting is wonderful.
The hate is horrible.
Peace"
" Pure Agony
",2020-03-10 00:00:00,2,Getting through this film feels like a life time perhaps that was the purpose of this film. Pure Agony
" Disappointed.
",2020-02-18 00:00:00,3,"With a terrific story to tell, the film was lacking. It failed to replicate the courtroom drama of Marshal or the nature of racism depicted in Selma. The Sheriff character in particular (a good actor in other films, eg The Enforcer) did not have enough of a sinister edge. There were no other acts of discrimination against either the Loving family or the wider coloured community. Pity; this could have been a great film."
" History
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,7,This was an important story in history that you would have thought by now would have been made into a film. This film is enjoyable because it tells the story of the people involved in the situation rather then all the court cases that panned out because of the situation.
" One lime
",2019-07-13 00:00:00,7,A subtle film that never compromises it's authenticity for dramatic licence. Jeff Nichols is one of the most interesting writer directors working today.
" One of the best picture of all time
",2019-05-28 00:00:00,9,"When I watched this film, it ceases to be a film and you feel you are a part of a real life experience and becomes more than just a film based on a true event, it becomes part of you"
" A movie that should have been great, turned out to be ordinary
",2019-01-22 00:00:00,7,"What pisses me off is when a monumental moment and struggle such as this loses its importance in it's cinematic portrayal.I didn't know about this case or this couple, and the movie made me aware of this particular legal struggle that inter racial couples had to endure, which clearly shows the lasting effects of slavery.The movie drones on, not doing enough justice to bring out the longing, despair and frustration of everyone and especially the couple in these tough times. The pace of storytelling was quite dull.I gave 7 stars only because of the real story behind it, and since there's probably never going to be another movie highlighting this epic struggle, it deserves a lot of attention.Surprisingly relevant emotions and narratives even today"
" Very good movie
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,9,"Just finished watching this film and I thought it was very good. Based on a true story a married couple played by Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga are forced to split apart due to their race(her being coloured and him being white)thanks to the supreme court who thinks its wrong and illegal for 2 people of different race to be together. But can the two love birds fight the court case to change the law and stay married?
The story is very good,the acting is top notch and I liked the theme of it as back in the 50s it was wrong for a coloured person to be with a white person. To me this sounded racist as nobody knows who they are gonna love. But overall I'll give it a 9/10"
" Softly stated and LOVINGLY presented
",2018-11-22 00:00:00,9,"Once in a blue moon...Do you get a message presented without overstatement. Most directors driven by a cause cannot sreer clear from over-rhetoric and ""tear jerking"" dialog. Most actors cannot deliver the sublime.Brilliant casting, acting and directing does what it is supposed to to do; lures you into the sense of ""being there"". By subtlety and seduction the message is conveyed. It is, in its genre, as good as good as it gets.Clear, valid and relevant statements are left for the viewer to behold. It's not genius - but not far from it."
" Powerful performancees, but lacks story
",2018-09-12 00:00:00,5,"They should have made it more interesting ,I get it it was based in real story ,but it felt long they should have cuted atleast 30 minutes more."
" Loving vs Virginia 1967
",2018-05-25 00:00:00,7,"This movie might be a bit too authentic for some viewers, judging from some reviews criticizing it as slow and/or boring. For the time and place the setting and characters seem very realistic, although may seem dull when viewing from 2018. Dialogue was simple and plain with no speeches or quotables, and the acting was painfully believable. The story played out slowly without any extremes in action. I found it fascinating and compelling because of the pace and realism. The true story is an historic and remarkable victory for civil rights, without embellishment. A goof: Mrs. Loving set her table with Corelle dinnerware in 1967, although Corelle wasn't introduced until 1970."
" A piece of history well told
",2018-03-29 00:00:00,7,"Based on a true story: In rural Virginia in 1958, Richard Loving and Mildred Jeter (Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga) are an inter-racial couple who live in a state where inter-racial marriages are illegal. They live through personal struggles while eventually getting legal help for their plight.Director Jeff Nichols has created a fine film in that every scene has a certain edge - not just those including nasty law enforcers but even the day-to-day activities of the couple and their respective families. He is greatly assisted by Edgerton and Negga who not only give strong individual performances but they also share a great chemistry together. They are the essence of the film. Edgerton shows a quiet desperation in his face as he quietly goes about his business. Negga displays a dignity in her shyness and even shows a comical impishness in her enjoyment of media attention in the second half. Another fascination is that the two main players of this film are both introverts who are fully able to draw in the viewer - a rarity in a medium that is usually more fascinated with extroverts.""Loving"" is a fine film overall though it has more edge in its first half. The second half is easily comparable to other recent films (""Selma"", ""The Butler"") involving U.S. civil rights battles in the 1960s. As the bar continues to get higher in this genre, it gets more difficult to surpass it. But ""Loving"" certainly meets it.In the second half, there are occasional references to ""the right to marriage"" without being specific. It makes one wonder if the phrase is referring to another civil rights battle on marriage that would take place a half-century later."
" I just didn't feel it.
",2018-03-28 00:00:00,5,"This movie is about such an important topic, and just that in itself makes it well worth watching. The fact that it is based on a real couple who went through what we're seeing here makes it even more genuine. It's heartbreaking, beautiful and at the same time it's about a normal couple just wanting to live their lives in peace.All this considered, I still feel that this movie could have been so much more than it was. For large parts of it the characters felt bland to me. The emotions and character development was lacking.Considering that this is a couple whose love is so strong and whose will to be together seem to survive just about anything I just didn't feel it. I didn't care about the characters the way that you do when they reach beyond the screen and truly touches your heart. It was like I couldn't quite understand why this couple fought like they did to be together, why they took the risks they did, why they didn't give up somewhere along the way etc. This did get a little better towards the end, but by then I didn't even care that much anymore which is sad since, like I said in the beginning of this review, this movie touches upon an important topic. I wanted to like this movie more than I did, if nothing else, then because of that."
" Loving is the pure definition of understated.
",2018-02-24 00:00:00,7,"Every aspect to this film is understated. Understated acting. Understated directing. Understated cinematography. Understated screenplay. I think you get the idea. All these components join together to create a nuanced story that lingers in your mind. The true story of Richard and Mildred Loving who were targeted by a law that prevents interracial marriage in West Virginia. With the assistance of civil right lawyers, they tackle the courts head on in an attempt to be heard from the Supreme Court. An important story that needed to be told, both thematically and literally. The blurred line between segregation and slavery laws that, combined, established racial stereotypes. Marriage is an inherent right regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation and it never fails to shock me how the abolishment of such laws have only been recent. We have to thank people like the Loving's who experienced consequences first-hand and desired to change the mistreatment of people like themselves. Portrayed enigmatically by Negga and Edgerton who were reluctant at being in the public eye during the case. They both conveyed innocence and fragility to perfection, and their on-screen chemistry was beautiful. Nichols' direction was splendid, he took care in detailing the home lives of the Loving's to enhance the characterisation. The cinematography was also stunning, adored the juxtaposition between rural Virginia and urban Washington. Unfortunately, the problem is with the glacial pacing. The runtime consists greatly of the Loving's and the way they live their daily lives, but has no impact on the greater picture on civil rights. There was no emotional impact until the last one minute where we discover what happened after the film. It's a sensitive topic, but it needed more power in order to convey its importance and unfortunately the screenplay didn't allow that. Exquisitely acted and directed, just not emotional enough for me."
" Disappointing
",2018-02-23 00:00:00,4,"Sorry, but I want to have a rant here. A number of top critics have used almost identical sentences in their reviews of this film, namely - "" It shows how far America has come in its views of race and equality - and how far is left to go"" This is of course complete rubbish, but sounds good. This film does show how far we have come, but how can the film show how far (as most will agree) we still have to go ? What disappointed me here was that a key civil rights case and the bigger picture are almost ignored for a love story that focuses on the couple themselves as the story. Hence, for example, the fact that Mildred Loving claimed on a number of occasions to be of Indian heritage and denied her black heritage, and that her marriage certificate identifies her as Indian is not mentioned in the film, and so the reasons behind this have been forgotten about. Instead of focusing on the bigger picture the film has to resort to creating drama when possibly there was none.......ie it is imagined that Richard Loving is pursued or followed by a car which he thinks contains unidentified persons wishing to do him harm (cue dramatic music, car chase etc)......all very exciting,
 for a minute (but hardly Bullitt)..... but is it true -----well there is a much evidence for that as there is him finding a brick in his car, again this creates tension and a sense of persecution. Ten minutes of the film is given over to showing Life photographer Grey Villet in their home - is that really key to this story ? Nope, but it creates a cameo role for Shannon and shows yet more scenes of the Lovings in love, as if the film needed more of them. If Nichols wanted to create a love story, and feels that is more important than the bigger picture then I would have liked to know how they met, what the attitudes of both Richard's and Mildred's families were to their romance, what barriers they encountered, but instead this is a film about an important civil rights issue masquerading as a romance. I found it disappointing and a bit dull. Performances are very good, especially from Ruth Negga."
" Simply Didn't Rise Up to the Greatness It Could Have
",2017-11-08 00:00:00,7,"Scene after scene leaves me as the viewer feeling helplessly wanting....every time. The movie as a whole lacks cohesiveness and most of all PASSION for such a monumental decision by the US Supreme Court. So much more energy could have been added to the characterizations from the couple themselves to the children or their families, the attorneys on either side, the law enforcement folks...dang, the nation as a whole.Missing are crowds of protesters on either side of the issue, and there are multiple false starts without any completion whatsoever. Example: There's the ""buildup"" of neighbor resistance to the Loving's marriage, specifically in Virginia when they go to live in VIrginia .... finalizing in that scene with a truck ominously following him home one night ... build up, build up ... and the final ""dramatic"" point is the installation of a telephone by a white installer ...That said, there's logistical points that are failed to be explained ... If a white man realizes that there is a white and black woman co- habituating AGAIN in Virginia .. how is it the law never returns to jail both Richard and ""Bean""? Ever. Yet they are still under the thumb of the 25 year suspension...A bar scene with Richard and some black friends and family dramatically focuses on the question of Richard ""just divorcing her"", but then fizzles into never never land ....The scene with the reporter and cameraman in their living room, surely to have brought attention to their living situation .. .yet NOBODY in Virginia is depicted of knowing much less DOING anything to enforce the sentence ...Attorney scene in front of the Supreme Court ... again ... no passionate opening or closing arguments ... just .... nothing really. There's simply NO climax, no passion, no connection.... Overall, a disappointing movie. I left the film WANTING MORE from almost every single scene, and most certainly some conclusions to the attempted build ups of probable drama.A big ol' pile of mush which is so sad because this ruling by our Supremem Court is the cornerstone upon which current marriages are gauged."
" To Each His Own.
",2017-10-02 00:00:00,8,"They finally got one right. How EASY it would have been to turn this into a formulaic triumph of justice over adversity. The story of a white man and his black wife in Virginia is waiting for stereotypes with open arms. The melancholic ""Negro gospel music"" and the heavenly choir at the end. There would be the sneers about ""Nigger lovers,"" the chain of cars full of rednecks pursuing the frightened couple across a rural landscape, the shotgun blast through the window, the handsome Loving husband, the chic and beautiful Loving wife -- and the speeches! ""We're not doing this for us; we're doing it or all mankind, and womankind too!"" ""Your honor, I love this woman. I'd do anything for her. I'd give my left testicle for her and I'd even think about giving up my dog.""But no. It's a movie about lowbrow Richard Loving, a cigarette smoker (Gasp!), a brick layer, and his wife whose case was brought before the US Supreme Court and dramatically changed the laws governing freedom to marry, and it is straightforward and it's made for adults. The Lovings were married in Washington, DC, and returned home to Virginia in the late 50s, only to be arrested for committing interracial marriage. Nobody objected to Mildred being pregnant. That's okay. After all, boys will be boys and we know how blacks are. But -- marriage? The Constitution was written to protect the states from too much federal government, but the amendments passed during Reconstruction were designed to protect individual rights from any authority, including the state. There was a rush of forward-looking cases beginning in the 50s, that enhanced the liberty of individuals and protected citizens from state laws violating their rights. The general idea was based on John Stuart Mill's principle of harm. Will an act harm others? In the instance of interracial marriage, nope. And if it does cause harm to others? Well, then you have to take the social context into account. If the benefits outweigh the harm to others, then others will have to live with it. But things like heroin addiction are out.I was really impressed by every aspect of this film, except that the legal questions were glossed over. It was by no means a typical domestic drama. The casting is damned near perfect. Joel Edgerton, as Richard Loving, has a compellingly ugly face. It looks like it had too many encounters with boxing gloves. He'd make a good brutal villain in some package of action junk. And he's got the role of the quiet and inexpressive pater familias down pat. He doesn't have that many lines and his features are so immobile that when he gets drunk one night, under all kinds of stress and nattering from whites AND blacks, and releases a few hearty sobs, it comes as a catharsis. Ruth Negga is Mildred, the wife, and she's very appealing. As in the case of Richard, the actress who got the role is no Beyoncé. She's fragile, gracile, winsome, has two large and soulful eyes, and an endearing little smile. Together they look like the two people ahead of you in the supermarket checkout line.The supporting players are equally well cast and deliver credible performances. The ACLU lawyer is inexperienced, nervous, and dumb. Richard's Mamma, Sharon Blackwood, a part-time backwoods midwife, is garbed in such a way that her head just seems to have arisen on a thick stalk from between her shoulders. She doesn't approve of Richard's romance with Mildred but it's not immediately spelled out. We only know something is wrong between them because when we first see Richard returning home from work, he says, ""Hi, Ma."" Without looking at him, she replies, ""Get some wood for the stove."" It isn't until an hour into the story that she tells him the marriage was a bad idea, that he ""should have known better."" (The very words spoken earlier by the sheriff.) ""I thought you liked Mildred."" She stops and turns to him, saying in a deliberate tone, ""I like a lot of people."" A special award goes to Marton Csokas as the sheriff. He's clean-cut, stern, and not a fat, bald, slobbering mess. He issues orders with quiet authority, with the menacing implication that if you don't do what he says, he'll reach down your throat and pull out your pyloric sphincter.Not a big budget epic but a nice job by all concerned."
" Movie Can Barely Muster the Energy to Tell Its Own Story
",2017-08-30 00:00:00,5,"There was surely a more compelling film to be made from the factual events upon which ""Loving"" is based. The soft-spoken couple at the center of the film were the spark that ignited a controversy that would eventually result in a Supreme Court ruling allowing legal interracial marriage. But the film we're given almost goes out of its way to avoid any dramatic conflict, making the fight this couple waged in the name of equality seem no more remarkable than a daily trip to the grocery store.Ruth Negga (Oscar nominated) and Joel Egerton give decent performances as largely inarticulate people who find themselves the center of something much bigger than them. If the actual events played out as they do in this film, fine. I'm not asking the filmmakers to invent facts or scenarios just to make their movie more interesting. But we could have been shown how big a deal this court case was, even if the couple at the center of it weren't physically present to witness much of it. We're told how much publicity the case got around the nation, but we don't see it in the movie. We're told what a big deal it was, but we're not shown it. The makers of ""Loving"" decided to make a movie about this topic, so they could have done something to bring dramatic interest to it.In these racially charged times, a story like this should have triggered all sorts of emotions in the viewer: outrage, sympathy, pride, fear, frustration, sadness, joy. Instead it left me feeling almost nothing, mostly because it seems like it can barely muster the energy to tell its own story.Grade: C+"
" Gravitas without Urgency
",2017-08-26 00:00:00,7,"The sad, shameful story of Loving comes undiluted from an American past we consistently fail to acknowledge. In 1958 Richard Loving (Edgerton), a white resident of Caroline County, Virginia wedded his young love Mildred Jeter (Negga) a colored woman. Subsequently, the couple was arrested for violating Virginia's miscegenation law, and given the choice to either leaving the state or serving a year in jail. ""Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he placed them on separate continents,"" the judge wrote. ""The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix.""Unsurprisingly, Loving stands against the above sentiment with uncommon poise and magnanimity. By virtue of existing and existing at a time when racial relations in America seem to be headed backwards, Loving can be considered a valiant parable. Upon further research one can also appreciate the film's historical accuracy; Mildred Loving did in- fact mail Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and the Loving case itself was not a purposeful cause by activists, but rather a couple who naively thought the state would turn a blind eye to their love.Yet somewhere in between Loving's pre-production and post-production all semblance of enthusiasm, charisma, and charm was lost. Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga, otherwise accomplished actors, stumble through scene to scene pigeon-toed; understating everything from cautious late-night drives to the struggle of maintaining an engine block. Of course the gamble to understate everything could have worked, if we were given room to breathe. But sadly the editing is too coarse to allow our able cast to carry the scene through. It's as if director Jeff Nichols didn't have faith that audience members would have patience so he tried to have it both ways – deliberate pace; snappy editing.What's left in the scattershot is just gravitas – a film so confident in its message that it doesn't feel the need to back up its careful, albeit beautiful compositions with any real drama. Loving's complete lack of urgency follows the film like a cipher, disabling it from becoming anything more than a slow-paced drudge. Perhaps I'm more speaking to the politics of the day but the contents of this film deserves a bullhorn not a whisper."
" What a Waste of a Good Story!
",2017-08-24 00:00:00,4,"There are so many problems with this movie. What a waste of a good story! They must have loved each other very deeply for them to risk everything and defy society. Yet, in this movie, there is no chemistry between the two leads. It's so miscast, it's hard to imagine they even like each other. I understand the focus on this movie is the couple and not the case. Yet, they made an impact at all precisely because of the landmark case. By barely skimming the Supreme Court case, it lost the point of the story. And the pacing is so slow, one could take naps between changing scenes without missing anything. It made the dramatic story very boring. What a shame! What a waste of a good story!"
" Sweet but nothing special.
",2017-08-21 00:00:00,6,"If anyone's ever curious why films based on real life events have to be dramatized, this film right here is why. It was a sweet film, with quiet understated performances, but not a compelling film to watch. The performances certainly didn't stand out from either Egerton or Negga. Her Oscar nod baffles me, besides the fact that she was in a politically correct film. I can't even think of a ten line movie review, this film was so underwhelming. Of course your heart goes out to the loving's and what they had to go through, but there had to have been a more compelling way to tell the story. It was very hard to keep my attention. My advice is read up on the case and skip the movie. You'll lose less of your life that way."
" A gorgeous film. Made for adults
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,9,"This small film was very touching. The drama was very real, and very genuine. It is the kind of movie that is not coming out of Hollywood these days, as the studios are experiencing creative bankruptcy. No wonder 2017 has been such a disaster for them, thus far. But, that is a good thing. Too many really inane action films, and the public is saying I do not think so. This film is the antidote to the poison affecting the studios, who are suffering from an astonishing lack of courage. Beautifully acted, with performances by Negga and Edgerton, as well as several other wonderful performances, like the one by the always great Michael Shannon.. The characters felt real. Edgerton played his character with such grace, and subtlety. It was a work of art. He played a quiet giant. Such grace under fire. The editing, cinematography, and direction was pitch perfect. We desperately need more films like this one, which was written, and made for adults. Kids just will not get this film I do not think. I highly recommend this movie, to anyone who enjoys real drama."
" quiet drama
",2017-07-28 00:00:00,7,"Richard Loving (Joel Edgerton) is a white man with many black friends and black girlfriend Mildred Jeter (Ruth Negga) in 1958 rural Virginia. She gets pregnant and he marries her in D.C. They are arrested for the marriage and accept a plead for suspended 25 year sentence. In exchange, they have to leave the state or cannot stay together. They move and raise their family in D.C. Five years later, Bernie Cohen (Nick Kroll) from the ACLU answer Mildred's letter for legal help.This is quieter than most social fight movies. It boils down to the Loving family. They are gentle people of the earth. They don't usually raise a fuss. Edgerton embodies the quiet Richard and Ruth Negga is brilliant. They really capture this loving couple. Director Jeff Nichols steers into the quietness by downplaying the court case. Even the general social upheaval is limited to the TV screen. It is really these sweet, unassuming people and the oppressive atmosphere of their situation. All the acting is great. The threat of danger is held back for the most part. They give Richard more paranoia but it's not dramatic in that way. It is a monument to the truth of love."
" loved it!
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,9,"A good film about a really important case in our nation's history. And it brings to late a shameful period of our collective past that we should never forget. Amazing that a case like this involved a family named Loving! Ruth Negga is awesome in her role, though Joel Edgerton never warmed up for me. And the film drags a bit, costing it a star in my mind. But the story is five stars all the way, and it is a film that should be seen by all! And that last image... wow. Powerful."
" Masterpiece.
",2017-07-15 00:00:00,10,"It's difficult to know where to begin with a film like this. It took nearly 60 years for someone to do this so I guess I would say that at least they took the time to get it right. It is an absolute work of art. And that deserves a lot of attention. But it's also, and primarily, a story about real people and the facts surrounding their lives. Specifically, their marriage. Marriage and raising children is difficult enough; just imagine what it would be like if someone like, say a policeman, stormed 300 years worth of systemic racism, segregation, and slavery, through it. Where this film succeeds so well is that it stays away from that larger picture, and that societal cauldron, and keeps the film focused on the two people at its center. They weren't worldly people. They weren't book smart. And their understanding of the world around them was simple enough to account only for the feelings they had for one another and not the artificial laws that would come to govern them for most of their marriage. I guess I would say that, ultimately, this film brings us into what felt like the real lives of Richard and Mildred Loving. The documentary on which this film is based, ""The Loving Story"" by Nancy Buriski, is a solid depiction of the actual characters. And Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga are outstanding as the Lovings. Director/screenwriter, Jeff Nichols, keeps the story within the confines of the personal with barely a page of written dialogue for the lead actors. The quietness of their relationship says more than they, or anyone else, could say about them. And there is just enough from the peripheral characters for the viewer to feel the crushing fist of institutionalized racism as they did. I loved this film. The story is compelling and needed to be told from the perspective of its main characters and that was done very well here. The marriage of Richard and Mildred Loving was at the epicenter of one of the most consequential Supreme Court rulings of the 20th Century. A ruling that was unanimous during a time, unlike today, when that was actually possible. The strength of this film is in the touching scenes between the Lovings. Scenes of simplicity like putting your children to bed and then going off to your bedroom at the end of a long day. Richard's daily life was punctuated with monotonous hours as a brick layer where things are predictable and the lines are straight. That was something that he could understand and was comfortable with. Ruth's was one of children and home. That, and one another, was all they wanted. And all they needed. In 1967 the Supreme Court ruled that they should be left to the peace and comfort of a private life. And 60 years later someone made a terrific movie about them. Which is a lot better than not ever making it at all."
" Swing and a Miss!
",2017-07-14 00:00:00,2,"This movie is so busy trying to create a message and an emotion, that it misses the fact that this is based on a true story, so there's no need for Hollywood to create that. The scenes are choppy and don't lead to anything significant most of the time. They did do a commendable job of casting the lead character's to favor the real Mr. and Mrs. Loving. But, could have done a better job of finding biracial children to fit the characteristics of the Loving children. I also feel that this movie portrays Richard Loving's mother as being against her son marrying a ""Colored"" woman. However, in the HBO documentary ""The Loving Story"", his mother in clear in her approval of this marriage. And speaking of the documentary, I suggest that anyone wanting to know the true story and struggles of the Loving family, should watch it instead of this movie. There is no chemistry between the character's or with us FOR the character's in this movie. Watching this movie did nothing for me except make me want to re-watch the actual documentary."
" A tremendous disappointment
",2017-07-02 00:00:00,5,"I was really looking forward to this film. Rarely have I been as disappointed. I couldn't stop thinking of ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence"". I know that sounds weird, but do you remember the most memorable line of dialogue in that film?: ""When the legend becomes fact, print the legend."" Well, although I have no idea what that facts were about the personalities of Mr. & Mrs. Loving, Mr. Loving is portrayed here as having a personality comparable to a brick. Even if the screenwriters and director had to fudge the truth a bit, it would have been preferable, and the flatness of Joel Edgerton's performance (whether historically accurate or not) is probably the key reason that this film was a flop at the box office. I actually began wondering if Mr. Loving was mildly mentally retarded. Or was it just a BORING performance by Edgerton? I don't know which it was, but in my view, it ruined the film. Why would anyone love this man? As far as Edgerton, at this point I have no desire to see him in another film.A second major flaw here was that we see none of the actual Supreme Court testimony. That would have been very interesting. One of the most important Supreme Court cases in history...and the Court process itself was almost ignored.On the other hand, Ruth Negga was very good as Mrs. Loving, and I enjoyed seeing up-and-coming actor Alano Miller as one of Mr. Loving's Black friends.I'm glad to know more about the case that I have heard so much about over the years, but really, this is a disappointing film."
" ***
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,7,"Joel Edgerton and Ruth Neggia give restrained performances in this film dealing with inter-racial marriage and bigotry and that's part of the problem here. Edgerton talks as if he has marbles in his mouth and Neggia's character of Mildred comes off much too nonchalant with the tremendous problem the inter-racially married couple face.Even when their case ultimately goes to the Supreme Court, we just hear the very generalized opening arguments by the Loving's attorneys. Even when the court reaches its decision, there is very little excitement upon the married couple's response.Am amazed that Ruth Neggia was nominated for a best actress Oscar and after seeing the film and her rather lackluster performance, there is no surprise that she lost.Even the racist police officers come off as rather blase here."
" Solid, frustrating story
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,7,"Loving is a tough and frustrating film. Richard and Mildred are an interracial couple in the 1950's who decide to get married. The story goes downhill from there.The outright hatred for the couple by the whites is palpable. The blacks also wonder why the white guy would go this way. The marriage brings a lot of legal trouble their way because interracial marriage was not quite legal in Virginia at that time.The couple endures years, decades of abuse. The actors do a great job of showing that the couple's only options were basically to shut up and take abuse after abuse that in today's world is unimaginable. The movie would have benefited from more details about how the couple met and got to the point where the movie started. It seems that Richard's Mom never really thought it was a good idea, so more development of that angle would have been great. All told, it's a solid, frustrating film because of the story. It's a social shame that this was how society treated non-whites at this time. It's really just hard to believe. Good story. Enjoy."
" Hidden Vigour: Negga excels in another glimpse into America's racist past
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,8,"A few weeks ago when I reviewed ""Hidden Figures"" I pointed out the how absurd the racist behaviour at NASA in the 60's must have appeared to a young boy in the audience at my screening.  In many ways, ""Loving"" – a film that has had a lot less publicity and is a less obvious 'crowd-pleaser' – makes a useful companion piece to that film.  It tells the true story (yes, yet ANOTHER 'true story'!) of Richard and Mildred Loving who travelled from their home town of Central Point Virginia to Washington DC where – as a mixed race couple – they could legally get married.  However, on returning to their home state and living together as man and wife, they fell foul of the State's repulsive antimiscegenation statute which banned inter-racial marriages. The Lovings were found guilty and sentenced to a year in jail, which was suspended on the requirement that – unbelievable but true – the couple leave Virginia and not return (together) for 25 years. The film documents the fight of the couple – largely led by the feisty Mildred (Ruth Negga) – to fight the injustice, taking the case ultimately to the US Supreme Court for an historic ruling.This was an Oscar-nominated performance by Ruth Negga and, man, is it deserved. It's a performance of such quiet understated power that it is a joy to watch. But also strong is that of Joel Egerton (""Midnight Special"", ""The Great Gatsby"") as Richard who here adopts a largely sulky and subservient manner that contrasts beautifully with Negga's perky optimism. I also loved the performance of Marton Csokas (Celeborn from ""The Lord of the Rings""), chillingly unreasonable as the bigoted Sheriff Brooks and Michael Shannon (""Nocturnal Animals"", ""Midnight Special"") as the Time photographer Grey Villet, capturing a classic picture that is shown (in standard 'true story' fashion) at the end of the film (and below).Written and directed by Jeff Nichols, whose ""Midnight Special"" last year made my top 10 of the year, this is a thoughtful and educational piece that should particularly appeal to older viewers keen to see a drama of historical importance beautifully told.

" good but audio a problem
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,7,It's just as well Richard Loving doesn't say a lot because I struggled to hear what was being said much of the time. A good film but you need to concentrate. Another bit of trivia: early on in the film a shot outside a house shows a panel of OSB (oriented strand board). This wasn't invented until 1963.
" Awesome
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,9,"Made with feeling. Aussie the wonderful Joel Edgerton plays the stoic Richard Loving with brilliant unembroidered simplicity and Ruth Negga plays Mildred in a particularly powerful display of emotion without words. The dialogue is parred back to a minimum leaving the looks to tell you how much they feel for each other.Richard and Mildred are shown as the integrated couple in a weird world where they fit together hand in glove and the white world (and some of the rest of it) doesn't want them too. Shown as a solid family with values that mean they want to be with near their families in the rural countryside in peace.Kiwi (and I am biased) Marton Csokas plays another great baddie, the local cop who thinks that Richard just wasn't brought up right. His lecture is a great embodiment of the sentiment of the time.I left with a profound sense of amazement that these people were prepared to risk their lives for their love. A great statement of the things people had to fight for at the time."
" Not loving it!
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,6,"Writer-Director Jeff Nichols' film ""Loving"" is a lovely true story about Richard & Mildred Loving; an interracial married couple in Virginia in the late 50's who were ostracized and condemned by Virginia legislation for their interracial matrimony. A Virginia Judge judicially ordered them to leave the state for 25 years,if not they would be imprisoned for one year. Their case was presidential, because with the assistance of a couple of young civil rights lawyers, they were able to take the case to the Supreme Court; which ruled that all interracial marriages would be legalized nationwide. An important movie, but there was not just enough cinematic loving in ""Loving"" for me to love it. Nichols, who is usually brilliant, develops a lackadaisical and dreary approach in directing & scribing the film; which in turn, creates a very boring tone to an important subject. Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga star as Richard & Mildred; their performances were mediocre at best; I just did not believe they were in love with each other within their work; needed to see more loving in The Lovings. Michael Shannon does bring some life to the movie as a Life Magazine photojournalist; but his brief performance was too short lived. Nick Kroll was kruelly miscast as Bernie Cohen, one of the lawyers who assisted the Lovings to bring the case to the Supreme Court. Maybe, some of you will love ""Loving""; unfortunately, it does not have my supreme support. ** Needs Improvement"
" Subtle and Stunning
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,10,"Based on the 1967 civil rights US Supreme Court case which held the banning of interracial marriage was unconstitutional in Virginia. This movie should be required viewing in all high schools. It reveals how terribly we violated the rights of our greatest resource, our fellow human beings and allowing them to be with who they want to be with. Joel Edgerton and especially Ruth Negga will take your breath away with their subtle, beautiful performances. Their quiet determination to be together as Richard and Mildred Loving is achingly romantic and essentially human. This movie should have won best picture as it reflects what makes the human heart so rare and beautiful; it is love. It never grows weary and sustains the greatest of disparaging behaviors."
" They tried so hard to make it worthy that they forgot to make it interesting
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,4,"In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries most American states enacted anti-miscegenation laws prohibiting interracial marriage; only a handful, mostly in the north-east, never introduced any legislation of this sort. During the early and mid-twentieth century attitudes began to change, and the northern and western states began to repeal these laws, especially after California's anti-miscegenation statute was struck down as unconstitutional by that state's Supreme Court in 1948. There was, however, one part of the country where attitudes did not change. By 1967 there was a stark geographical divide. In every single one of the former slave states of the Deep South, except Maryland, interracial marriage was still illegal. In every other part of the country it was lawful.""Loving"" tells the true story of Richard Mildred Loving, a couple from Caroline County, Virginia. Because Richard was white and Mildred black, they were forced to travel to Washington DC to get married, but in 1958 Virginia refused to recognise interracial marriages performed in other states; indeed, state law made it a criminal offence for Virginia residents to travel out of the state to enter into such a marriage. Richard and Mildred were arrested and charged with breaking this law; they were sentenced to a year in jail, but the judge agreed to suspend the sentence if they would leave Virginia and not return for 25 years. The Lovings moved to Washington, but did not like living in the city, and grew nostalgic for a return to the Virginia countryside. With the aid of the ACLU they petitioned the Virginia courts for a review of their case and, when this was denied, took the matter all the way to the US Supreme Court.The Supreme Court's decision in Loving v. Virginia, which took place in 1967, finally invalidated America's surviving anti-miscegenation laws and is regarded as a major milestone in the civil rights struggle. This could have been an inspiring film about an inspiring story, so it is a pity that the film as actually made is so dull. Part of the reason, I think, is paradoxically that the film-makers were so keen to stick to the historical truth. Although the sixties were a period of racial tensions across America, particularly in the South, these tensions do not appear to have affected Caroline County to any great extent, and the Lovings appear to have experienced very little hostility or bitterness from their neighbours.Richard and Mildred are portrayed throughout as deeply in love with one another. As played by Joel Edgerton, Richard comes across as a stolid, good-natured man who rarely displays much emotion other than affection for his wife. Mildred, as played by Ruth Negga, at first seems rather passive, but later emerges as a stronger character; she, for example, seems more determined than her husband to pursue their legal action. Any differences between them, however, do not seem to have led to serious tensions in their marriage, and they are never shown arguing with one another.Now I am not arguing that the film-makers should have invented conflicts where none existed in reality for the sake of a good story; too many films supposedly based on historical fact have done that sort of thing for me to be happy with it. The film, however, seems altogether devoid of any sources of tension, and it certainly would have been possible for the film-makers to have found some. Given that the film tells the story of a court case, I am surprised that no attempt was made to turn it into a courtroom drama and that we see so little of the actual court proceedings. We never even hear the arguments which the State of Virginia put forward in order to justify their position, the counter-arguments put forward by the Lovings' lawyers or the reasons why the Supreme Court found in their favour.Not only does the film lack tension, it is also overlong and moves too slowly. Yes, it tells a worthy, uplifting feelgood story about the triumph of reason over prejudice. It's just a pity that they tried so hard to make it worthy that they forgot to make it interesting. 4/10"
" well done, thumbs down
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,3,"My objection to films like this is that they are moral lies. A story about a victimized interracial couple in the south in the 50s, is like a story about someone in Hollywood being blacklisted as a result of the McCarthy hearings. Modern sentiments are so thoroughly on the side of the protagonists, there's no room for moral tension or the least bit of thoughtfulness. Personally, I think telling this kind of story is cowardly. It ignores the fact that life is never this simple, and it reinforces the false narrative that it's okay for people to view themselves as victims because their circumstances are oppressive."
" ""Loving""--The Right to Choose
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,9,"Loving opens as a tender romance between Richard Loving a white construction worker and tinkerer in car mechanics (the relative newcomer Joel Edgerton, a Golden Globe nominee), and a shy black and American Indian woman named Mildred (Academy Award-nominated Ruth Negga who gives a startlingly nuanced performance). Loving starts out revealing that Richard and Mildred's parents fear repercussions for their illicit love. Their fears were well founded. The Lovings were arrested, jailed and convicted. Ordered to never set foot in Virginia again, Richard and Mildred are exiled from their families. But neither family ever abandons their exceptional support for Richard and Mildred.

" Great ordinary heroes, the real life heroes
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,8,"I think very few people know this movie. Ruth Negga deserved the Oscar nomination, she is fantastic in the movie. And we don't forget about Joel Edgerton, who also gives us a powerful performance. I think it pretty sad, the people don't know this movie and they will forget soon. A good movie, good acting, touching and beautiful. People nowadays want superhero movies and sci-fi and forget the ordinary heroes, the real heroes like Mildred and Richard, who did great things. Thank you for them and thank you the filmmakers to show us this beautiful story and those two wondrous heroes. When I see the movie, like Loving I feel we won't forget the everyday heroes among the superheroes. In the age of superheroes and superpowers, we forget the real superpowers: the love and the steadiness. Definitely watch this movi"
" Review: Loving - Well-made with fantastic performances.
",2017-03-08 00:00:00,7,"It's very irritating that here, in Australia, we get this kind of film so long after everybody else. There's a trade-off in the fact that we generally get big-budget blockbusters anywhere between twenty-four and seventy-two hours before the States, but it's still frustrating that Loving was released in November, and here we are, in March, only just getting it now. I suppose it was worth the wait.Loving tells the true story of Mildred and Richard Loving, an interracial couple living in 1958 Virginia. Forbidden by law to marry, the pair elope to Washington before returning home to raise a family. Local law enforcement promptly arrests the newlyweds, and they're exiled from the state for twenty-five years. We stay with the Lovings from this point through to the historical Supreme Court case Loving v. Virginia in 1967.The film begins with Mildred revealing her pregnancy. This was an interesting decision which really put the weight of the film on Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga. We don't see them meet, we don't see them fall in love, and so we have to be convinced of their feelings for each other after they've already married. They're both phenomenal performers (Negga certainly earned her Best Actress nomination, and, if possible, I was even more impressed with Edgerton), so this absolutely happens eventually. For the first portion of the film it's a little hard to feel the characters' love for each other. Both performances are so realistic and subdued that, as an audience member who was shamefully ignorant of the events upon which the film was based, I honestly didn't know if one of them was going to cut and run. We have to take them at their word that they love each other. Again, as soon as the film found its feet, this changed dramatically and you find yourself connecting with the characters more than you expected.The supporting performances are also great. Their family and friends, the pair of lawyers (Nick Kroll and Jon Bass) who represent them, the legal system who hamper the protagonists. Edgerton was featured in writer/director Jeff Nichols' previous film, Midnight Special, and his fellow cast member Michael Shannon returns for one touching scene with the Lovings.It's also very well-made technically. I don't remember any of the score, but I remember that I liked it. Like the performances, it was subdued, adding to the film without being too loud or obtrusive. The cinematography was wonderful, as was the lighting and general production design. This is a simple story of two characters. It didn't need to be made so well, and yet it's so much better for it.This kind of biographical film is one that I appreciate. I'm grateful to have watched it, because until I did, I didn't know anything about the events contained within. Too often, biopics feature an event that's only just happened, giving it a cash- grabby kind of feel. It's been fifty years since Loving v. Virginia, and fifty-nine since Mildred and Richard were married. Perhaps it's because of the decades since it happened, perhaps it's because I live on the other side of the world, or perhaps I simply need to care more about important events in recent history, but I'd never heard of the case nor it's plaintiffs. It's important that this kind of case is remembered, especially now, when very similar fights are still being fought.One thing that was a little jarring was Marton Csokas' sudden disappearance from the film after seemingly serving as its primary antagonist for much of it. I suppose that's what happened in reality, but I feel like we should've been some kind of closure on that front. I should also mention that the drop in technical quality when the film employs archive footage/audio is both noticeable and annoying. You're hiring actors to play every other part, why do we need to hear the original tapes?http://alexfalzon.com/loving/"
" A groundbreaking love story
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,9,"This enjoyable movie really makes one think: how would it feel to be considered a criminal for marrying the person you love, just because of what the person looks like? Most of us watching this movie or reading these review will never know that horror, and it is because of this couple and the people who supported them.This is what makes a great movie, it makes you actually think. A good movie can just be enjoyable, and need not go farther than that. A great movie will make you look at life differently, and if the great movie has great characters it will make you look at others differently, too.This is a great movie."
" Admirable and problematic
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,7,"A film whose emphasis on understated, everyday love is both its highest achievement and its own undoing. The film wants us to understand, at the extent of legal battles, racial tension and civil rights, just how normal and common the Loving's love was. This is both admirable and problematic.Their love is too common and taken for granted to amount to much more on screen, and the legal battle so short-handed it's hard to engage with it beyond the future knowledge of its importance. I want to commend this film with a pat on the back, and rough enough that it might jolt it into some kind of fiery energy all its own."
" A story just lacking in eventfulness
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,6,"The story that 'Loving' is based around is unquestionably an interesting one. The only problem is that it was also reasonably uneventful, which doesn't really lend itself to a great movie. Unfortunately because of this the movie feels flat and as if it's stuck in first gear for long periods of time. Which is a shame because at the heart of this film is a beautiful (and true) love story of two people defying the odds and doing whatever it takes. That gets a little lost unfortunately due to the way the characters are portrayed (highly unlikable at times) and because of the focus being shone elsewhere. Done a little differently I think this film could have worked.Ruth Negga has been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Lead Role and I'm a little bit miffed as to why. I've mentioned in previous reviews of racially diverse films this year that there was always going to be a bit of a backlash to last years #Oscarssowhite controversy. Fortunately for Negga I suspect she has benefited from that whole debacle quite nicely. You'd be hard pressed to describe her performance as Oscar-worthy. I kept waiting for her to be given a scene where she could just blow us all away and justify her getting the nod, but it just never came. I would give her zero chance of winning on the night.'Loving' is a film that tells about a great event, but one can't help thinking that it simply wasn't film-worthy. Without bending the truth, which it's admirable that they didn't do, there is simply not enough here to justify a two hour run time. There's nothing overly bad about it it must be said, it just isn't going to blow you away."
" Loving ShowMeTheMovies Review
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,7,"An almost-excellent historical drama based on the US court case Loving vs. Virginia. An interesting tale portrayed well - a break from the usual glossy, Hollywood image.Set in 1950's Caroline County, Virginia, Loving expands on the true lives of Donald and Mildred Loving; a working-class, interracial couple whose lives (and families') get torn apart when they elope to Washington D.C to marry. Not accepting the legislations against them, in an era in uproar over civil liberties, the Lovings' begin what seems to be a losing battle (legally and emotionally) for the right to keep their family together.Ruth Negga - the shining star of this flick - was wonderful to watch as Mildred Loving (nee Jeter); her flawlessly understated, emotional performance held strong throughout. Joel Edgerton (Donald) alongside her, the pairs' chemistry bode well on-screen, though his solo performance slightly dull. The entirety of the cast worked well together for both an accurate yet captivating result.Though enjoyable, Loving lacked in intensity and came across rather 'vanilla' at times - a lacklustre screenplay, a predictable nature and a mostly uninspiring setting. I expected a bit more oomph; something more empowering, inspiring or admirable to be displayed from this groundbreaking, real-life story - instead, the legal battle is its' weakest asset.I will, however, praise Loving for its lack of in-your-face, politically-correct agendas; the rights and wrongs need not be explained, the movie purely left to go its' own way in its' individual story.Heartfelt, gentle and quietly powerful, this was a moderately enjoyable movie that I struggled to find specific criticism in - but I still felt as though something was missing.Loving was a nice alternative to the glamourised Hollywood 'masterpieces' that so regularly get churned out. Worth a watch, for sure - just don't expect it to become your favourite movie of all time."
" Jeff Nichols is a director to keep an eye on.
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,7,"Loving is a movie with a sensitive story and very strong, and we also have in this film one of the strongest interpretations of last year, Ruth Negga is excellent in the movie, and was deservedly pro Oscar, and if she wins I'll be very happy, Joel Edgerton also does a great performance, and what I'm going to talk about will anger many, but his performance is better than that of Ryan Goslig in the movie La La Land, and he deserves more indication, Jeff Nichols' direction is Very good, and he is very young, he has already done a good job in the movie Midnight Special, the soundtrack is good, the film has touching dialogues, and strong moments, even with several defects, the script is full of ups and downs , I think with a better script, Loving would be a much better film, and Jeff Nichols' direction would be even better, Loving is a good movie, and we have great performances by Ruth Negga and Joel Edgerton.

" A beautiful and wonderful movie!
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,10,"This really is a must see. For me, the movie is so good mostly because of how understated and simple it was. Everything was subtle and yet incredibly powerful, from the acting to the music to the cinematography.The music is not something I usually take too much note of in movies and yet I did here because it was not used as often. A few times there was background score and other times just natural sounds like the wind, bugs, etc. Some songs were used in the background and a few times they would bleed into a scene and the same song would be playing on a radio the characters were listening to.The acting was incredible and when people say that these are award worthy performances I can say I fully agree. I watched The Loving Story documentary again on June 12 and can say that Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga truly became the Lovings to me. Both were also able to say volumes with the simplest of facial expressions. At times I really felt like I was watching the real Mildred and Richard Loving. Their performances kept making me flash back to the documentary because at times it felt so much like I was watching a fuller version of it.I also really loved the cinematography and the simple shots that focused on a flower here and there. Something about it just made it all connect and feel more real.Everything about this movie is subtle, understated, and simple, but that is also what makes it so very powerful. It all made it feel more realistic, like I was a fly watching these people live their lives and have to deal with such hatred and racism instead of watching a movie about them. I also admit I shed a few tears at the end when a few of the after events information was shared. I know I will be seeing this again, especially if is makes it to a theater closer to home, and will be buying it when it is released on DVD/Bluray."
" A Surprisingly Low-Key But Socially Relevant Movie
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,5,"I will admit right off the top that almost from the beginning of the movie I was waiting. For something. Something more. Something that would grab me. Something that would scream at me ""you have to keep watching this!"" And that ""something"" never came. This is an interesting and important story. Compared to most movies that are based on true stories, this was even (as far as I can tell) quite accurate to the details of what really happened. Which may explain why such movies often take so many liberties with the facts - they have to spice things up a bit. I didn't have any trouble staying tuned to the story. It didn't put me to sleep and my attention wasn't wandering. It just seemed to lack what I might call oomph. There was no punch to it. But it did deal with an important piece of history.In the late 1950's in Virginia (and in many southern states and a few others) blacks and whites were not allowed to marry. The anti- miscegenation laws were very real and they were enforced. But people are people and sometimes people fall in love, and laws that try to prevent that from happening are of little effect. In 1958 Richard Loving (white) and Mildred Jeter (black) were in love, expecting a child and living in Virginia when they decided to travel to Washington, DC to get married. Upon their return to Virginia they were both arrested and put on trial and found guilty of violating the laws against inter-racial marriage. Their sentences were suspended on the condition that they would leave Virginia and not return together for 25 years. That began a years-long legal battle that eventually ended up in the United States Supreme Court, which ruled that marriage was a basic human right and that all bans on inter- racial marriage were unconstitutional.That's basically the story that was told. It was simple and straightforward and quite lacking in emotion. Joel Edgerton played Richard and Ruth Negga played Mildred. Edgerton was exceptionally even keel; Negga played her part with a bit more feeling, and to me was the more interesting of the two, and the one who was far more inclined to push back against the system that had declared them criminals simply for being in love and wanting to marry. Negga gained an Oscar nomination for the role, and she was very good in it. Interestingly, though, the only part of the movie that I found really tugged at me emotionally were the closing captions, which noted that a few years after their legal victory Richard was killed in a car accident, and then offered some words from Mildred - quoted from an interview shortly before her death in 2008 - which somehow struck a chord with me: ""I miss him. He took care of me.""Loving vs. Virginia was a case that played some role in the debate over same sex marriage in the United States. The fact that the Supreme Court had recognized marriage as a basic right was obviously significant to that discussion, and Mildred Loving herself spoke out in favour of same sex marriage. Although the connection was obvious, I was glad that no overt reference to the debate over same sex marriage was made, even in the closing captions. That would have taken the focus off the Lovings, which is clearly where it needed to be.In the end, this movie may lack spark and emotional intensity, but it's still a love story - and a story in which love does win out in the end.

" Steady Film
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,6,"The word that comes to mind while watching the new Jeff Nichols film, LOVING, starring Oscar nominee for Best Actress Ruth Negga is STEADY.Based on the true story of Richard and Mildred Loving, this steady film tells the steady tale of their steady fight against Virginia's anti-miscegenation laws (the law that forbids interracial marriage) and the inevitable steady argument at the Supreme Court.Here are the various definitions of steady from the Merriam-Webster dictionary:1a :  direct or sure in movement  2:  showing little variation or fluctuation3a :  not easily disturbed or upset And that is as exact a review of this film as I can make.  This film is steady.  When the Loving's are arrested early on in the film they remain steady.  When they are forced by the Judge to move out of state, away from their family, they remain steady.  When the ACLU lawyers take their case, they remain steady.  When they...you get the picture.Steady is real (as I'm sure Director/Writer Nichols intended).  Steady is true to facts.  Steady is reliable.Steady does not, necessarily, make for an interesting film.  And that's my problem here.  Not enough happens to keep my interest throughout the 2 hour 3 minute length of the film.  There are no highs and lows, things remain on an even keel.  And, I'm sure, that is how (and why) the Lovings were the perfect couple for the ACLU to use in their fight against this law, it just wasn't strong enough for a film.As stated above, Ruth Negga is nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her work as Mildred - and I don't really have an issue with this nomination.  Her work is strong, honest and, yes, steady and she holds the screen well enough.  Matching her tone, strength and steadiness is Joel Edgerton as her husband, Richard.  He was just as good and their scenes together rolled smoothly across the screen.And...again...that's the issue.  There were no ""highs"" and there were no ""lows"", they were just steady.  I was waiting the whole film for the ""Academy Award"" scene that Negga knocks out of the park and it just wasn't there.  She was strong throughout, I just needed some fluctuation.The only real spark in this film is when Nichols regular Michael Shannon (himself nominated for his work in the underrated NOCTURNAL ANIMALS) shows up for an extended cameo as a LIFE magazine photographer.  He injects some life. emotion and change of pace - without spoiling the mood of the film.This film could have used quite a bit more of that.Letter Grade B- (for the steady performances and the important subject matter)6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"
" The choices of life we want to live are ours to make.
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,7,"The film was inspired by the real life event, book and the documentary film. The message was awesome, but it's more like a personal. At least from the film's perspective about a couple and their struggle. Also the personalities of those two, who are so quiet, hence seems it was like a documentary film with a feature film touch. That does not mean Ruth Negga deserved the Oscars nominee. She got it only because of the black quota, otherwise there are many great performances to be considered who are not white, black or even American.So coming to the film, I like this kind of drama, It was so realistic and I won't mind if it runs past two hour mark. The first appreciation must go the two lead actors, they were the soul of the film. Surely awards worthy performances, but like I said not the Oscars. Especially I loved the Joel Edgerton's part. It is one of his, maybe the best I have seen so far, For many reasons the people should watch this. Jeff Nichols of 'Take Shelter' fame did good in writing and direction, especially after his slightly disappointing previous film. One of the best biopic of the year and I recommend it not to miss, particularly for the family audience.7/10"
" Crap Accents by OK Actors.
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,6,Once again we are forced to listen to a bunch of decent actors fumble their way through American dialects as they tell the story of the Lovings. An interracial couple in Virginia during the 60's. The actors are trying their best to sound natural when they don't. They do their best with the dialects but inevitably screw it up some way here and there. The casting is all wrong. Some of the children of this interracial marriage are blacker and darker in complexion than their mother who is black. Which brings up the question of parentage of the children which is not part of the story As for the film. This is more of a made for TV Lifetime movie rather than a real film. It shouldn't have been nominated for anything. Definitely not for best supporting actress. But it's interesting historically and well acted despite the non Americans bumbling through an American accent. This movie isn't that interesting when comes to the script. It's my belief that the movie was greenlit more because story is about racism than the story is actually that exciting to watch.
" 'I know we have some enemies. But we have some friends, too.'
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,9,"'I know we have some enemies. But we have some friends, too.'Jeff Nichols is both a writer and director whose films Mud, Take Shelter, and now Loving make tough statements or recall traumas that are of lasting importance - none more so than Loving which very quietly recalls the true story of the couple who lead the way toward equal rights in both interracial marriage and miscegenation. Very briefly (because everyone knows the story), in 1958 in the state of Virginia where interracial marriage was a felony Richard and Mildred Loving (Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga), an interracial couple, drive to Washington, DC to be married, and then challenge their anti-miscegenation arrest for their marriage in Virginia which led to a legal battle that would end at the US Supreme Court.That Edgerton and Negga offer fine performances is a given, but the film is enhanced by the bit roles by Sharon Blackwood, Christopher Mann, Marton Csokas, Nick Kroll, Michael Shannon and others that round out the cast of the film.While there is no question that this is an important docudrama, especially at this moment when racial relations are front-page news and the event of the story is one of the hallmarks of the civil rights movement, the film itself is very slow moving. The dialogue is flat for the most part, or subdued, to the point where the tenor of the 50's and 60's is disregarded. There are few moments when the clashes that were heard round the world are evident – the strength of the Lovings is quiet and without evidence of the cruelty they suffered.Perhaps that is the intention of Jeff Nichols – to not sensationalize the story but to simply tell it in quiet but determined terms. But for many the contrast of the struggle to live in the world in those times is missing."
" Loving
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,7,"It was Awards Season, and I was looking at all the films up for the nominations, those coming to the cinemas, those coming to DVD and those online, this was one of those releases, but it was perhaps the plot that got my attention more. Basically in 1958, in Caroline County, Virginia, white construction worker Richard Loving (Golden Globe nominated Joel Edgerton) falls in love with a local black woman and friend of the family, Mildred Jeter (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Ruth Negga). Mildred discovers she is pregnant, they decide to get married, but anti-miscegenation laws mean that interracial marriage is a violation, so they travel Washington D.C. to get married, and when they return Richard plans to build a house close to Mildred's family home. Soon afterwards, Mildred's home is raided by the sheriff's deputies, the Lovings are arrested, Richard points out the marriage licence, Sheriff Brooks (Marton Csokas) dismisses this, saying it has no validity in Virginia, and they are hauled to jail. Richard and Mildred plead guilty to breaking the anti-miscegenation law, they are sentenced to one year in prison, but the Judge Bazile (David Jensen) suspends the sentence, on condition that they do not return to Virgina for twenty-five years. The Lovings move to Washington to move in with Mildred's friend, but Mildred wants Richard's mother Lola (Sharon Blackwood), a midwife, to deliver their first child, so they briefly return to Caroline County for the birth of their son Sidney, they are arrested again, but their lawyer Frank Beazley (Bill Camp) clears them claiming he erroneously advised them they could return. Mildred and Richard have two other children together, son Donald and daughter Peggy, but Mildred is frustrated being away from the country, and her frustration watching the March on Washington by thousands of African Americans for equal rights in jobs and freedom. After Mildred writing to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy for help, they are referred by him to the American Civil Liberties Union, lawyer Bernard S. Cohen (Nick Kroll) takes the case and consults with constitutional law expert Phil Hirschkop (Jon Bass), they conclude the case for the Lovings could go to Supreme Court, and could overturn similar anti-miscegenation laws across the nation. Following an accident, the Lovings slip back into Virginia, while their case moves through the courts they settle in a remote portion of King and Queen County. Their case gains wide attention, photographer Grey Villet (Michael Shannon) profiles them for Life magazine, the state contends that people of different races were never intended to live together, and the Lovings' children are suggested as being bastards. The state Supreme Court refuses to ignore the Lovings' conviction, but Cohen and Hirschkop appeal, Cohen before going to Washington asks Richard if he has a message for the justices, Richard replies ""Tell them that I love my wife"". In the end, after several weeks the Supreme Court unanimously agree that prohibited interracial marriage is not constitutional, the Lovings are permitted to return to Caroline County, and continue building their dream house, in 1975 Richard was dies in a car accident, while Mildred continued to live the house he built until her death in 2008. Also starring Alano Miller as Raymond and Will Dalton as Virgil. Edgerton and Negga are equally fantastic in their performances, this film also proved to be successful for breaking the Oscars lack of racial diversity controversy, I was most interested to see a film about a landmark change in civil rights, it works well as both a love story and one about courage and commitment, it may be clichéd at times, but it is an simplistically intelligent historical drama. Very good!"
" Grossly overrated & very unimpressive
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,5,"It's not really bad, if i can think of any words i would use to describe it's fine. Doesn't really do anything bad, doesn't really do anything great, it's just fine. The problem is the movie is just really boring, i checked my phone at certain points (don't worry, i wasn't in the theater) and it was just boring. Ruth Negga was good, but she wasn't like, amazing. I didn't like Noel Edgerton, i didn't like how he mumbled all of his lines, and that he had pretty much the same face throughout the entire film, i can admit his mumbling added to the realism, didn't make for an entertaining movie though. They did a pretty bad job at making me care for the characters and helping me understand their relationship. The movie literally opens with Ruth Negga telling her boyfriend she's pregnant, so they just throw us into this relationship without any semblance of thought or effort. It was decently informative, but it definitely wasn't entertaining, and i would never watch it again. The movie lacks an amount of human emotion, most characters don't even smile throughout the film and they just feel like robots, you don't understand why anyone does what they do, they just do it cause the script says so. The fact that this was nominated for best actress in a leading role and Arrival wasn't is freaking bull crap."
" A good movie, but something is missing
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,6,"I think this is a good movie. Do not fall into sentimentality. The moments are contained and that gives power because it has strength but at the same time does not give you the tear to cry.For me the problem is that the film is moving too slowly. It entertains in things that do not come to story and that although they are seconds it is delaying the film. She resorts often to her husband's work, and most of them do not tell them anything. There are many television plans that slow down the story.The actors are content, which makes them much better. She is sensational, as much as he who comes to seem what he pretends, an uncultured villager. But even so, after the phone call, I miss a touch of joy. It is clear what is going to happen since it is based on real events, but it should be a pleasure.It does not look like a good picture to me. Only the interiors are well lit.The address is simple. Plane against plane and general plane. Slow down the narrative.However it is very well set. Makeup, hairdressing, art are very good. There is a moment scrubbing dishes that scrub them with a rag.I gave him a six because I do not think it's a seven but it's more than a six."
" Loving a Civil Rights Drama
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,5,"This is a racial harmony drama, based on a true story about Mildred (Ruth Negga) and Richard (Joel Edgerton). Richard is a labourer who is pulled along as the reluctant protagonist. Set in the 1950's. They were married in Washington but arrested when returning home to Virginia.Interracial marriage was illegal in Virginia and the judge demanded that they left the state for 25 years, shocked by his ruling Mildred writes to R. Kennedy and this sparked off an important legal case which became a media story. Richard was a quiet, private man who just wanted to love his wife and remain isolated from the media, it's obvious that he really didn't want the story to go public. A magazine photo article, created more public interest in the story and the case escalated all the way to the Supreme Court and ultimately altered the constitution of the USA.There were some emotional scenes and sensitive performances, but I just found the film was lacking sufficient emotional drama, maybe some scenes from the Supreme Court hearing might have provided the climax I was missing? I wanted to like this but couldn't help comparing with 'United Kingdom' which followed a similar theme but was a far superior film. Though I'm a big fan of understated films, this two hour film felt more like a three hour epic."
" I'm Coming, Virginia
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,10,"This film has two strikes on it from the get-go and the fact that it overcomes these going away is a measure of its quality. Strike #1 is a leading man who looks like a cross between a young John Voight and a Neanderthal and strike #2 is Nick Kroll, as the lawyer who took up the Loving's case and who is such a dead ringer for Milton Berle - the eyes, the mouth, the smirk - that I had to look him up to see if he was related. The two strikes combined tend to work against the sympathy we are clearly meant to feel; the leading mans' impersonation of a Neanderthal makes us wonder how the glowing Mildred (Ruth Negga) could ever have spent five minutes in his company whilst the Uncle Miltie gives the impression he's smirking at his clients rather than defending them for the right reasons. In spite of this the film works, probably because of the total lack of histrionics, or, as Jack Webb's Sergeant Joe Friday would have it, just the facts, m'am. For me the best thing about all this is that Viola Davis is nominated as Best SUPPORTING Actress for Fences which means she is not in direct competition with Ruth Negga, cause I'd hate to have to choose between them. All Negga has to do now is go to the mat with Isabelle Huppert, the only other Best Actess nominee fit to slug it out with Negga."

I went into this movie thinking it was going to be slow and a little boring. The story is important but I wasn't sure what type of movie they could make out of it. Whatever I was expecting...this movie surpassed them and then some. This is just a great movie with very little ""dead air"" spots and really kept me interested and moved pretty quickly considering the subject matter. You are so invested in the characters that you find yourself cheering them on and really rooting for them, despite the fact that you already know the outcome. That is the sign of a great movie, and this pulls that off perfectly. Overall, a real surprise and must watch movie that I highly recommend.

" A lot loving here
",2017-02-03 00:00:00,8,"This review of Loving is spoiler free **** (4/5) QUIETLY Provocative. THIS is a phrase that hasn't been used in modern cinema for quite some time and for a while it felt like we were going to get another film like it. With writer-director Jeff Nichols has been changing the modern film image over the years with films such as Shelter, Mud and more recently Midnight Special and now with the powerful American Civil Rights drama, Loving it seems that his face for modern film won't stop dramatically changing. Based on the real-life story of Richard and Mildred Loving an interracial couple who were challenged for their anti-miscegenation arrest for their illegal marriage, in 1958 Virginia.The case went on for many years until the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Unit) got involved in their case, putting a risk on the US supreme court. In Loving, Nichols plays the story calmly by giving a lot of thought to his material which drives the film forward and gives it the thumpingly powerful beat it deserves. The material is low-key but delivered powerfully by Joel Edgerton (his second appearance in a Nichols film) and Ruth Negga whose Virginia accent is incredible. Edgerton plays Richard Loving, a hard-working man born in Virginia; he's a strong-willed, persistent person who will literally do anything for the woman he loves. Negga's, Mildred Loving an African-American housewife who's also strong-willed these two share a giant heart. They live in complete harmony sharing their love with each other; he even vows to build her a country house, where they will live with their future family, he vows to look after her with all his heart.Unfortunately the state of Virginia don't take their love well and the court to take action by arresting the couple for their illegal marriage, they are put into separate cells while they await their case with the court of the state. Here the film changes its pace, yet it still has its heart as Richard tries his hardest to bail his wife. But when they get to the court they have a decision either go back to prison or have their sentence suspended for the next 25 years during that time they will have to leave the state, they go with the easy option, as they don't want to be apart. The years pass and they are living in their new home with their chemistry still as strong, there is no negativity, no arguments whatsoever.There is one moment in the film, when Mildred decides to write to Attorney General Robert Kennedy the general of the ACLU, she desperately tries to get him involved in their case. She tells her husband what she has done and just to the point when he is about to explode he soon calms down. It's a film with a lot of heart even as Richard getting constantly intimidated by typical police baddie Marton Csokas, Nichols keeps it on the lighter side. Sure enough, it's slow at times, yet it's brilliant and Edgerton's is powerful but it's Negga that gives the film its beating heart, she takes control of the whole story if there is a chance for anyone to win the best actress Oscar it's her, her performance is beautiful. Loving has a lot of heart-warming moments and a lot of sad moments this is a powerful American Civil Rights drama with plenty of material.VERDICT: A powerfully heart-warming American Civil Rights drama with a lot of love, a lot of story and a lot of interesting aspects, plus career-best performances by Edgerton and Negga."
" Important story of interracial couple's fight for justice proves fascinating but adversaries have little presence in second half
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,6,"Loving tells the little known story of the Supreme Court case, Loving vs. Virginia, in which an interracial couple was arrested in the State of Virginia for violation of their anti-miscegenation laws in 1958. Joel Edgerton, an Australian actor, plays Richard Loving, a laid-back construction worker who falls for a local black woman, Mildred Jeter, played by Ruth Negga, an actress of Ethiopian and Irish ancestry.The first half of the movie is fascinating as it chronicles the couple's marriage in Washington, D.C. and subsequent arrest by Virginia authorities in Caroline County. A local lawyer makes a deal with the judge who banishes them from the state for 25 years; the judge tells them that if they return, they'll be arrested. Later they do return since Richard's mother is a midwife and Ruth feels comfortable having his mother deliver her newly arriving baby. The couple catches a break when they're hauled before the same racist judge who lets them go with a warning after their lawyer maintains he incorrectly advised them that they could return for the birth of the child without penalty.What's interesting about Richard is that despite being Caucasian he's depicted as having been friends with black people all his life. It's brought out that his father used to work for the richest black man in that particular part of Virginia. Despite his noted lack of prejudice, Richard possessed an extremely taciturn personality, and Edgerton does his best illuminating a part that doesn't lend itself to great dramatic flair. Ruth's personality is also quite low-key, but as the couple finds themselves in the news after the ACLU took on their case, Ruth becomes slightly more assertive than her husband, especially in voicing her hopes for a successful resolution of the court proceedings.After their first arrest, the couple is forced to move to Washington, D.C. Their aforementioned return to Virginia due to Ruth's pregnancy, is an exciting dramatic point, as they once again are forced to confront the Virginia criminal justice system, a worthy antagonist in the film.But in the second half, the narrative begins to slow down considerably. There is a scene where Richard may or may not be chased by a mystery vehicle on a deserted road and later finds a brick, wrapped in a Life Magazine article about the couple, on the front seat of his car, which functions as a warning and a threat. But the bulk of the machinations involve the legal maneuvering that leads to the final showdown in the highest court of the land. While we do meet the two lawyers who argue the case before the Virginia Courts and later the Supreme Court, we never see any of the Virginia legal antagonists involved. And the arguments before the Supreme Court justices are virtually non-existent. Instead, there's a scene involving a Life Magazine photographer who comes to the Lovings' house and takes pictures in order to publicize their case.Director/Screenwriter Jeff Nichols was probably trying to show the ""quiet dignity"" of the Lovings throughout and I will say he succeeded. But their quiet dignity is a little too quiet, ultimately making the narrative dramatically inert. The other problem is that Nichols is unable to capture any sense of the couple, warts and all—they are such low-key, nice people, that one wonders if they had any idiosyncrasies, except maybe Richard's interest in drag-racing (depicted at the beginning of the film).Nichols has done a great service in bringing us an important story that's part of American history. It's a beautiful looking film as well, but beautiful Hallmark Greeting cards also need more nuanced characters, and strong adversaries, to propel the drama forward effectively."
" A powerful story of an ordinary couple who changed history
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,8,"History is full of accidental heroes who stood at a time and place where something profound happened around them. This theme shines in Loving (2016), a film about a couple whose marriage was challenged in the USA Supreme Court in 1967. In one of the exquisite ironies of history, the couple's surname was Loving and it was only love that kept them together while a slavery-era law tried to pull them apart.In 1958, white construction worker Richard Loving (Joel Edgerton) and his black girlfriend Mildred Jeter (Ruth Negga) drove from Virginia to Washington so they could legally marry beyond the reach of their own State's anti-mixed marriage laws. On return they were arrested like common criminals and given the option of a year in prison or 25 years of exile from Virginia. That was no choice for a couple expecting their first child. While in exile, Mildred is inspired by the black rights marches and writes to Attorney General Robert Kennedy who asks the American Civil Liberties Union to take up their case. Eleven years later, it reached the Supreme Court and history was made.What makes this film outstanding is the way it blends a history lesson with the dramatization of the human effects of racist legislation. Neither the history nor the drama overwhelms the film. The period styling exudes authenticity and the acting performances are finely calibrated portraits of two humble people who became caught up in an era of profound social upheaval. While Richard is over- awed by the growing national attention to their case, Mildred understands her role in history and what she can do for all black people. Joel Edgerton is brilliant in playing surly mistrust of the legal system and is a steadfast protector of his wife. The beating heart of the film, however, is Ruth Negga's performance. She consummately portrays the emotional highs and the lows, from the hope-filled blushing bride to the shattered prisoner of moral injustice, with an acting repertoire carried entirely by her huge expressive eyes.This is a powerful film. It is not about heroes or villains, but ordinary people who played a small part in shaping a major turning point in history. To call it entertaining is not the right word. Rather it is an engaging, enlightening and worthwhile story about how a Loving couple changed history."
" Loving (2016)
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,7,"I first saw the commercial for this film on Election Day and thought it looked excellent. I'm a bit of a history buff, but for some reason the case of the Loving's slipped my mind. This film is about a couple who endured rough times where interracial marriage was illegal. The story is based on the landmark Loving v. Virginia Supreme Court case. While I don't find the film to be fantastic, I thought the performances all around and a few of Jeff Nichol's film techniques really made this film an enjoyable experience.The opening is extremely powerful. The film opens in silence as you see the couple sitting and deeply pondering. You see the pain in their face as they know what they must face in the world around them. I think this film has really powerful but subtle performances by Edgerton and Negga. Edgerton is damn near unrecognizable and a force as the soft spoken Richard Loving. An even bigger force was Ruth Negga. She doesn't have to do a whole lot because things come naturally to her. Every expression on her face conveys a statement and even in her silence you can see so much of her character coming to life. I haven't really seen Ruth Negga in anything else but I'm certain she will have a great future. Its a soft, understated performance but boy is it a really good one. She definitely deserves her Best Actress Oscar nomination.The other aspect of the film that really contributed to its enjoyment, was the style of Jeff Nichols. Nichols usually focuses on families and the turmoil and how they endure life. This was the case in his previous efforts, Take Shelter and Midnight Special. Nichols' films also are set in a rural area. This film differs in subject matter to his previous sci-fi dominant efforts, however the slow burning technique and powerhouse performances are all there. The film even utilizes Michael Shannon, who has become a veteran in Nichol's employ. There are also other moments where a powerful score just elevates the scene.While the film isn't perfect and is not making my top ten films list of the year, I'd say the endearing performances and characters full of dimension really make the film worthwhile. If you are a fan of Nichols' craft, you won't be disappointed. This is a vast improvement after Midnight Special couldn't really follow up a really good Take Shelter. This film may have started my love for all things Ruth Negga.7/10"
" An interracial couple fights the state of Virginia in order to save their marriage.
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,7,"Ruth Negga is a great actress who I hope to see more of in future films. Her performance in Loving was mostly shown through her expression. The same goes for Edgerton. Their relationship was simple and quiet. They showed their feelings through wide eyes, upturned mouths, and furrowed brows. They did not talk much, but you were never in the dark about what they felt.The cinematography was beautiful and was profound in showing the differences between the city life in D.C. versus the country life of Virginia, which coincides with the point of views as well; forward thinking versus staying the same.Despite this inspiring story, the movie dragged in a few places. As an audience member, I was mostly interested in the legal side of their story, but the script had various tidbits of their daily life from their friends, job, and racing (which seemed out of place). I guess Nichols was trying to make us connect to the characters. It succeeded with Mildred, but not so much with Richard."
" Love trumps hate
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,10,"When you watch this movie, you can't help think of all the people in the world that try to stop others from just being happy and being themselves. The film is historical, of course, documenting the factual story of the ridiculous racism in the South, but it's not overwrought with the negativity. It simply shows a couple in love, raising a family, while others in ""power"" try to prevent them from doing so. Love is love, and who is anyone to try to tell someone else who they can love and who they cannot? It's hard to believe this situation still existed 50 years ago in the U.S., but when you see the headlines today from certain states in this country, maybe it isn't surprising. Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga are excellent in their roles, and you realize that this isn't about law, logic or sanity. It's simply about love, and the appropriate last name on the court case (and the film) makes it all the more poignant. The film has some pacing issues, especially in the beginning, but overall, it's an excellent story that reminds us all Americans eventually do the right thing, even if a stubborn minority of them fight progress all the way to the bitter end."
" A good film, not a great one
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,7,"I was, shall we say, ""warned"" that Loving was a quiet and meditative piece, despite being in contention for awards and I was frankly all for it. People who eventually are considered heroes don't actually feel heroic during their lives, and Loving does an excellent job of presenting Richard and Mildred Loving as two ordinary people. We first meet them when Mildred announces to Richard that she is pregnant. He expresses his happiness and then the two hold hands and kiss. It is a very quiet scene, emblematic of what is to come. These are two quiet country kids, not given to much talk and living in a rural community so small and poor that interracial relationships, while still frowned upon, aren't uncommon. Richard wants to do right by his girlfriend and new child, so he takes her to D.C. which he explains will be ""easier"" and they marry in a simple civil ceremony. And here their problems begin. Instead of legitimizing Mildred and his child in the eyes of the law, the marriage is considered illegal and Richard and Mildred end up being separated from their families, forced to leave the only home they have ever known, to go live in a city in a different state with no grass or trees. Though both Mildred and Richard are devastated by this, they are both tight- lipped about it, and you can see, through their actions, that neither one blames the other for their misfortune. They remain deeply committed to one another but dream of a time when they can return together, knowing in their hearts that they are good people who only want to raise their children near their family. I would say this portion of the story takes up about the first half of the movie. It is delicate and thoughtful and Ruth Negga and Joel Edgerton, playing the principle characters, despite being about a decade older than their counterparts were at the time, are still charming and effective at portraying who these people are with only looks and glances. It's the second half of the story when things fall apart. Everything related to the infamous court case is like it comes from a completely different movie. Even the music is different and loud and obnoxious. It's bizarre, all the scenes that are solely related to Mildred and Richard remain as touching and lowkey as ever, while everything else seems weirdly tacked on. The second half of the movie also covers about a decade of there lives, while the previous half covered a year or so, so the effect is jarring and lopsided."
" The Mad Max of 2016
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,7,"Nothing happens. Give credit to director Nichols for presenting a true story without dramatic dribble. Give credit to the ACLU for picking a model case. But nothing happens.I think I am okay with that.We have experienced enough stories pertaining to civil rights that there are now expectations. Allow me a demonstration. I present a theoretical movie. There is a man. A white man. He is married to a black women in Virginia when racism is omnipresent and codified. Besides his wife, his great pride and joy is his car. There are many scenes of this man maintaining and caring for his car. He races his car. He beats the stuffing out of some white folks who look none too happy. Now, a question for all of you who have seen a movie before. How many seconds does this car survive after the race and upon demise how tall are the flames?Not in Loving. In Loving, the car lives.Without a scratch.In a world of kiss, kiss, bang, bang, acts of quiet are the most insane. This is Loving. Where racist sheriffs and judges don't so much snarl as shake their heads. Where a child gets hit by a car and gets back up. Where landmark Supreme Court cases get resolved off screen. Richard and Mildred Loving are a couple. Less a pair of protagonists, more a historical inevitability. Their story shared by countless others. A romance without melodramatic climaxes, but with ongoing support and mutual adoration. I might have already missed it, but I think this is the point in the review where I am supposed to give a brief summary of the plot. Loving is the story of Mildred (Ruth Negga) and Richard Loving (Joel Edgerton). The film begins well into their relationship. The couple have already reached a level of trust that when Mildred announces an unexpected pregnancy Richard can only conceive of one path forward. But until death do us part is a tricky proposition in Virginia. State law forbids interracial marriage. The socially acceptable solution is to live quietly, unrecognized. This is impossible for Richard, who decides to drive Mildred to nearby D.C. where they can legally marry. After returning in bliss, their happiness is thwarted when an anonymous tip alerts authorities. The couple is thrown in prison, pleads guilty, and agree to leave the state to avoid prison time. This arrangement is excruciating. Mildred feels torn from her family and that a city is no place to raise a family. Richard simply wants to care for his wife without interference from the outside world. So when ACLU appoints fledging lawyer Cohen (Kroll) to look into the case the development is both salvation and agony. I try to avoid making convenient comparisons, but my best description of the unfolding of Loving is it is the thematic opposite of 2014's Selma. Selma bludgeoned, the theme, the drama, into, your face, in every, single, scene. Still a beautiful story with unforgettable examples of hard lighting. I am sure Selma well play for ten minutes during civil rights units in classrooms for years to come. But in Loving, trailer moments are sparse, and honestly, when they happen can be a touch awkward. Highlighting scenes to explain the couple seems almost seems a waste of time, but I will give it one try. I laughed the first time the Lovings meet Cohen. The neophyte's knives a plan where the Lovings return to deliberately get arrested. The humor lies in the ridiculous contrast. The pair radiate sincerity and simplicity, and Cohen by comparison is a madman. Over the course of the movie this honest aura mostly fades into the background. It endures, but in a way that is less than engaging. So yes, many audiences who watch Loving are going to be bored out of their skulls. Full disclosure, if not for the midafternoon show time I probably would have been yawning with them. The heart of the film is a pair of subtle performances and the surrounding material is edgeless. There is one tense sequence when the Lovings first return to Virginia. Probably saved the film. Otherwise, well, it is pretty. I guess will spare you the pitiful cover up with phrases like ""well crafted."" I liked Loving. I liked the approach. I loved the Lovings, just not the film."
