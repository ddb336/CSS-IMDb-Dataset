" A worth it movie
",2021-03-23 00:00:00,10,Very entertaining movie. I think i have watched this more than 100 times.Very Good comedy!! I bet people who rated it 1/10 have laughed to at least one of the scenes in this movie.I really recommend watching the movie and not go by the bad reviews.
" A great 3 for 1 Movie
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,9,"This movie has drama , comedy & dancing .
The characters are very fun and drama ads that extra dimension .
We actually used this for New Years Eve 2020 and while preparing food I heard the people in the living room laughing their heads off .
We were a a diverse group . . . 2 Indians , an African and 3 USA folk .
The Indian girl knew Shah Rukh Khan but had never seen the movie .
She believed the brain damaged people who call this a bad movie and didn't want to watch it . Later she was laughing and had a great time .
I also noticed she became completely taken during Deepika's dance numbers .
Everyone was in much better spirits after this movie which is important given the horrible COVID year .
Thanks Red Chiles for this great Comedy / Drama / Dance production .
We Love you here in Silicon Valley / Northern California !"
" Bollywood masala
",2020-12-15 00:00:00,6,A film with made so much money because of its hype not a bad movie but still not a good movie yet 1 time watchable movie
" Worst movie ever
",2020-10-28 00:00:00,1,Although I have not Seen the movie but it my wish to give the rating because I don't like starkids and khans Kapoor
" Not great!
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,2,"The movie was a little waste of time , the movie's storyline didn't make any sense and the movie wasn't funny , it was cheap ! I am hoping for better movies than this in the future , and all the escape techniques used in the movie made no sense at all!"
" Bad Spoof of Shalimar
",2020-10-06 00:00:00,4,"Happy New Year review:The film borrows its heist plot from the 1978 Dharmendra - Zeenat Aman starrer ""Shalimar"",with a retribution angle thrown in. This hackneyed story, old as the hills, is crammed with Farah Khan brand of gross humor which includes Abhisheks character puking all over, a gay interlude between 2 contest judges, Sajid Khan screaming in a special appearance and general low brow spoofing of Srk's past hit dialogues. Admittedly, there are a few LOL moments like the team learning salsa and the silent ""argument"" inside a lift.On the acting front, Srk despite looking old and tired, pitches in a restrained performance allowing the other actors to take charge. Abhishek Bachchan surprisingly does well in his over the top act.The end product is a dafter version of ""Shalimar"" but definitely better than Farah Khans last outing ""Tees Maar Khan"". Risk it!!Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni."
" Entertaining
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,9,This movie is amazing and greatly exicuted by all the actors
" Riot of laughter!
",2020-06-26 00:00:00,7,"This movie was made for entertainment and entertainment alone.Just pure fun and a great watch after an exhausting day of work. I loved the casting.
Classic big budget mass entertainer!
AbRam's cameo was the cutest thing I've ever seen!!!"
" Just as an SRK fan
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,4,Only valid point is if u r an fan of SRK then u can watch but enjoy to a little and after tat u cant remember any good memories of this movie...a bit lengthy..a simple and known story line of a usual. Revenge story with known consequences and unimaginable sequence of screenplay
" Painful to finish
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,5,"Huge SRK fan, even a fan of Farrah Khan, but this excuse for a movie is a true abomination. the cinematography is good I guess and the plot should provide a decent movie, but it's way too long, nonsensical and the characters act way too cartoonish."
" Excellent TP Movie !
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,8,"Abhishek shines out of all of them , he was incredible so was Srk and boman . Enjoyed it very much and I wish the helipad fight sequence could have been avoided . Rest everything was enjoyable ."
" The making of HNY
",2020-01-29 00:00:00,1,"Late 2013... SRK watches Dhoom 3 and is terrified by the fact that Aamir is treading into his territory of multicrore absurdity and that too in better style.SRK's thought bubble ""I cannot allow this. Something has to be done...soon"".Calls Farah ""We have to make a film that has all the elements of this and more. And it has to happen ASAP. The next year has to end happier""Farah: ""OK""Farah was in the loo. Immediately pulls out a piece of tissue paper and scribbles out the key elements of D3:Father commits suicide because of the villain.Son(s) swear revenge.Son robs the villain and ruins him. Absurd heist.KamliAamirJackieAbhishek& UdayCircusFarah's thought bubble: ""OK now, here's what I can do"":Father commits suicide because of the villain.(I'll copy this)Son swears revenge(I'll copy this)Son robs the villain and ruins him.Absurd heist.(I'll copy this. And I can make the heist more absurd... he ha ha ha)Kamli (Kat's too busy. No worries. We'll put Deepika and put a song that has ""Kamli"" in it... And I'll throw in the ""malang"" swinging on sarees bit into the same song. 2 D3 songs in one...beat that.)Aamir (Now that's impossible. SRK has to have a job)Jackie (He can't be the father again. So lets make him the villain)Abhishek& Uday (I'll make a new hybrid character. More irrelevant and stupid than both of these combined. Abhi fits the role best...yess I'm a genius!)Circus (Can't copy it as is... Lets make it a reality show instead... a dance competition... they are all like circus anyway)Lets add some Kapil's comedy night stuff, some epilepsy jokes, some vomit jokes, some cheap female body part jokes, some petty nationalism, Modi(he's the flavor of the season) and some more in it to cater to SRK's ""and more"" requirement.And voila... the story is ready! Oh, let the name be Happy new year. SRK will like the symbolism.Add the marketing muscle and barge into all the high TRP TV shows before the 1st weekend so that many see it before the word gets out.And release it in as many theaters as possible to milk the max out of the hapless public before they realise what they gotten themselves into. He ha ha.Flush.""Hello Shahrukh. Here's the plan...."""
" What the hell is this? It's not comedy action romance what genre movie is this. Worst movies ever no common sense. This should not be called a movie.
",2019-11-20 00:00:00,1,Worst movie ever. This is beyond jani dushman. Bollywood actors will do anything for money nowadays. Just shows human nature. Sadness.
" Good bit of fun
",2019-09-06 00:00:00,5,"Okay, let's get this straight, Bollywood seems like it's coming close to it's untimely demise. However, ""Happy New Year"" breaths a fresh breath of life into Bollywood. It's a self aware rollercoaster, making jokes at its own stereotypes and tropes very successfully whilst still having a strong plot narrative. I feel as though this film is definitely worth the watch as it's good family fun, but if you are looking for the best of Bollywood, look up films before the 2000's."
" I do not recommend this movie to heart patients. Stay away
",2019-06-16 00:00:00,2,"WTF is this nonsense? Is this a movie or some kind of spoof? Everyone overacts, literally everyone, story is so stupid and laughable, direction was third class, dialogues were rubbish, action was exaggerated, performances by the entire cast were hammy and over-the-top. Basically there's not a single positive thing you can say about this unbearable circus. Just 3h of baboonery and childish comedy with extremely irritating characters that will surely get on your nerves. The film gets idiotic to the point where you just cannot take it seriously. Lastly I hope you all were well-paid to perform such a crude act on screen, great job, you did your best in showcasing your cheap acting skills."
" awsome its a vine
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,10,Watch now in hd then you will entertain u for sure.this movie is like old vine its beautiful.
" Love this movie
",2019-04-25 00:00:00,10,It fun and I watch it over and over. I love the actors and just the concept. Watching with subtitles and still enjoy.
" Movie doesn't good
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,6,"This movie looks like mission impossible, Unfortunately it's not. It feels me boring."
" Happy New year turned Sad
",2019-01-04 00:00:00,4,There was no thought process where loosers come together and loots the bank and take part in a dance competition to cover up. There was no acting but overacting. Didn't like the story nor the film direction. Amazing actors and a director whose combination didn't work..
" Pathetic movie
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,1,Can't bear it. So bad movie. Overacting by all the actor's. It's basically a comedy film without any comedy in it. Farah Khan should stop making movies. Like before she gave tees maar Khan and now same torture with happy new year..
" One of the worst movie.
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,1,"I stop going into the cinema after this f,*** movie."
" Enjoyed this, fun movie
",2018-04-12 00:00:00,10,"After reading all the bad reviews I wondered what I was in for, but I found Happy New Year to be a fun film. Most of the Bollywood films are shoot 'em ups which is okay for some if that is all you want to watch. I like to laugh at some movies and this is one that also has some serious moments concerning the father that the main plot is surrounded by. I enjoyed it and would recommend it."
" best indian movie ever
",2017-12-17 00:00:00,10,"To all SRK haters and people who gave bad reviews about this movie YOU ARE JUST JEALOUS !!!!!
The movie is amazing better than those wannabees movies it was completely age appropriate it was funny ,emotional and entertaining ( which is what movies are for ) the songs whoever said they are below average well can you tell me why they are played all over phones? coz people like them DUHH!!

AND YES DEPIKAA MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE 
TO all people who had HEADACHES if it not a good nO need to Get urself another headache by writing a novel length nonsense review .
SO LONG !"
" The Other Reviewers Have It All Wrong
",2017-08-26 00:00:00,10,"This is what Bollywood is all about. On steroids. With lasers. In Dubai. And in my case, in 4k. The stock characters, the lame comedy, the contrived and impossible story. Never mind. Let's sing & dance. My only minor complaint: except for Korea, the other countries' dancers weren't featured enough. A giant 10, for sure, and it seems that India agrees with me, not the naysayers."
" Fun musical, great dancing
",2017-07-24 00:00:00,8,"I like these big productions out of India. This one is fun, funny, and lavish. Lots of costumes, expansive sets, great lighting. My favorite part, however, was the CREDITS! That's right, the credits are fun too, for each group —gaffers, electricians, makeup—all get a chance to dance too. Very original and fun idea. And the robbery? Suspend disbelief and enjoy the show."
" One of the best films i have ever seen
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,10,"Holy Moly what a ride, If you love classic over the top absolutely ridiculous Bollywood, this movie is for you! the Dramatic, hilarious, over the top, vibrant, unexpected, insanity of this movie makes the seemingly long 3 hour run time vanish quickly, you won't regret it.While absolutely hilarious most of the time, occasionally gets serious in some very well done parts of the movie. despite it being a comedy movie first and foremost, the serious parts won't at all feel out of place. I would definitely recommend seeing this movie, it starts out a little slow but wow it's great!"
" Most disappointing SRK movie I have watched
",2017-05-19 00:00:00,3,"Before this movie came out, I had high expectations from Farah Khan and SRK combination because they delivered Main Hoon Na (an ode to the 70s in a cheesy manner but a well-made movie with a good message and emotions). I do accept that I had some really good laughs in this movie but if I were to isolate them from the story, the movie itself is riddled with so many factual inaccuracies and plot holes that it could easily go down as one of the worst SRK movies in his entire career. This kind of movie making huge dividends at the box office is a sure sign that Indian audience need to rise above their star fad and give way to intelligent movies. 2014 witness some good movies too but they were all drowned by the SRK stamp during the year. One of the reasons for my disappointment with this movie was that it was shot in Dubai (which is a nice thing) but it fed all the stereotypes that Indians have about Dubai. SRK is a highly revered Bollywood actor among the Emiratis and this was one of his chance to showcase the glamour and glitz of Bollywood by taking UAE as a base and showing correct things about the country (since he is one of the brand ambassadors for Dubai) but this was by far one of the disgrace he has shown to the country. Few examples of this such as saying that the law for theft in Dubai is chopping off hands (which is wrong) and, in the ending, the Dubai police would never take an accused to the police car in front of public. I could go on and on criticizing this movie not because it was a horrible movie but because such movies made money and audience do not even object such nonsense and it showed the city in a bad light. If we see any misrepresentation of India in any Hollywood movie, we make it a personal offense and start boycotting, doing Twitter trolls and make mountain out of molehill then why should we bad- mouth or downgrade another city / country. I also heard that the script of this movie was selected in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science. I am happy for that. This movie is a testament for the budding film-makers on how not to make such a trash movie like this."
" An entertaining and fun movie...loved it!
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,8,"So big deal, the movie had a lot of cliche's in it. No one cares about that in an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. You sort of expect it. I enjoyed this movie because it was ""entertaining"" and took me away from all the depressing things I see on a regular basis in life. Just seeing Shah Rukh Khan dancing in a pink tutu and jumping into the arms of Sonu Sood was enough to make me laugh out loud. I mean, c'mon, how can you not laugh at scenes like that, which by the way had the piano tune, ""The Entertainer"" playing in the background, or Shah Rukh Khan dressed like Jackie Chan, sparring with a Korean dude, while ""Everybody Was Kung Fu Fighting"" is playing? Okay, it started out as a well planned heist for revenge, but turned out to be, for me and for ""Charlie,"" a story that made me feel good about 6 people who were willing to put themselves out there and won the respect and applause from all those people that had originally booed them and treated them disrespectfully. It was one of those movies that made you happy to see the the underdog win! I'm not from India, I'm Italian, but during this movie, I found myself cheering on ""Team India"" primarily because they were so proud of their country and their heritage. Not only that, the music and dancing was great! It's one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a while, so I bought the soundtrack...and the movie.""Happy New Year"" was definitely a ""feel good"" movie. I don't think the movie was meant to be this epic drama. Leave that to ""Devdas"" and ""Kal Ho Naa Ho."" It was meant to be a fun, happy, musical movie that left you energized and proud of your country and it's people! We need more of that in our world!"
" Awesome Family Movie
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"A motion picture without serious dramatic content, a weighty message, or intellectual depth, which serves simply as enjoyable entertainment. This is according to Google the characterization of a popcorn movie. And this is exactly what Happy New Year is to us as a family. It is packed with lots of fun scenes and we keep going back to watch them. The songs are catchy and although not of Indian origin our kids started to sing along. The cast seemed to have a good time making the movie and has definitely found some new fans here in Switzerland. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes to enjoy himself and has a big bag of popcorn at home."
" Completely misunderstood! I loved it
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,8,"People, if you are looking for a serious movie, something that is intense and meaningful and has a message, this movie is NOT for you. This is for when you are down and upset and lazy. If you are willing to just watch it for a good laugh and some great music, then you will definitely enjoy Happy New Year. I have seen this movie multiple times and I still laugh at some of the scenes. And not just a smirk or chuckle, a serious laugh out loud.The music is both fun and beautiful ( Manwa Laage is my favorite) and will make you want to dance. Deepika looks beautiful and lovable as her character. Sonu Sood is hilarious without trying hard and SRK just looks like a tall glass of wine (that beard needs to stay on ALL the time, super sexy) Personally I wasn't dead set on having a perfect plot and the perfect story. I was just watching it for fun and it was great. And it actually is funnier the second time you watch it. Just go for it, ENJOY!"
" Lazy production
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,5,"This was pretty bad, I have to agree with most people. SRK looked tired after working on those abs, which were really not that necessary. Deepika's character was quite hazily and lazily defined, but I still gave HNY a 6 because the idea of some ragtag team of idiots having to win a dance contest in order to steal some diamonds was a ridiculously hilarious parody of Oceans Eleven. Also, there were some laugh out loud moments and they were all due to Abhishek Bachchan. He really needs to do more comic roles; that's where his talent lies."
" Should watch if you have enough time
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,7,"At first the movie is too long. Film is nearly 180 minute long. Character design is too simple but it makes people like them. Story is predictable and so much caricatured.But it is Bollywood and we like it for this. At the end ""Manwe Laage"" is awesome song,you should listen it."
" This movie stinks
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,1,"Chandramohan Manohar Sharma, better known as Charlie (Shah Rukh Khan), is a street fighter who has been yearning for revenge from Charan Grover (Jackie Shroff) for 8 years. Grover, with his rich and despicable mind, labeled Charlie's father, Manohar Sharma (Anupam Kher) as a thief because Charan had conned him into stealing his own Diamonds (he stole his own diamonds and framed Sharma for stealing them) priced at INR 100 crore ($15 million). Charlie finds out through the media that diamonds worth $300 crore will reach the Atlantis Hotel on Christmas Eve. He wants to steal the same diamonds and frame Grover. To accomplish this, he must assemble a dynamic team.First in his team is Former Army Bomb Squad Captain Jagmohan Prakash, or Jag (Sonu Sood) who has a hearing deficiency which happened when he failed to defuse a bomb; he gets furious when someone insults his mother. Second on his team is Tehmton Irani, or Tammy, (Boman Irani) who is an overweight jogger and suffers from epileptic fits. It is also revealed that Tammy and Manohar were best friends. Third on the team is Rohan Singh (Vivaan Shah), a young hacker who Charlie believes can hack into Shalimar's computerized system. He is also Jag's nephew. After thoroughly researching about the vault, the team finds the main vault comprises a bio metric lock (fingerprint lock). The problem is that only one person can access the vault at any time.The team heads to a warehouse which was originally their workshop for a rehearsal. It is revealed that Tammy was immensely in love with the Shalimar vault and he is the only one to open the vault without the combination. The real Shalimar vault has a laser shield in front of the vault whose code combination is changed everyday. The team finds out a weakness that the Shalimar safe is in the Altantis hotel underground which is connected through an air duct system which is further connected to room 9C, a lounge room in Atlantis. Charlie then explains a problem, being that room 9C is booked for a team participating in the World Dance Championship (WDC), a dancing competition. The group refuses, but Charlie re-motivates the group, convincing them to become a dance team."
" What did I just watch..
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,5,"Only reason I decided to watch this, was because it looked like it was getting a lot of hype about it and it appeared in Netflix. Also, probably because this movie has SRK(king of Bollywood) and Deepika (super pretty). This movie is basically a stupid comedy. You know, those types of movies, where everything is just so stupid, you can not help but laugh. It did attempted to be a drama and a romance but, with the sudden switches between these themes, it was difficult to take it seriously. Most of the romance were silly clichés, as well.The silly theme of love at first stuff. Also, it keep showing the main guys' shirtless all the time.I know its probably to get female views because of them have six packs, but it was too much. And not in the way ""omg its too much, i can not control myself"". More like ""are you kidding me, how does this make sense). Two good things about the film is Deepika's outfits (I want them) and the ending dance. That's why my rating is a 5."
