" Alexander in the Middling, Mediocre, tolerable, all right film.
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,6,"Another film faithfully watched as part of the trawl through the movies available on Disney Plus, ""Alexander"" was one that I hadn't seen before and despite not being particularly excited going in, it was actually reasonably good.Thinking that his life is hard, relative to that of the rest of his family, Alexander Cooper (Ed Oxenbould) makes a birthday wish for his family to experience one day as bad as his life. Unfortunately the day in question sees his father, Ben (Steve Carell) attend a job interview, his mother Kelly (Jennifer Garner) have an important book signing, his older brother, Anthony (Dylan Minnette) have both Prom and a Driving test and his Sister, Emily (Kerris Dorsey) has her opening night in a stage show of Peter Pan, in which she is the lead. Each disastrous day compounds another until Alex and the family, count their blessings and enjoy each other's company.The case are all pretty good here, with perhaps only Alexander himself not being as natural a child actor as the film could do with. You can add small roles for Bella Thorne, Megan Mullally, Mary Mouser, Jennifer Collidge, Burn Gorman and most impressively Donald Glover and Dick Van Dyke.Let's not go overboard with our praise here. To say that I thought it would be completely awful and was pleasantly surprised to find it not too bad, would be more appropriate. It's a farcical, slapstick comedic action film, with regular accidents culminating in things getting set on fire and catastrophic damage to the family car. It's not going to live long in the memory, nor does it have any moments or scenes of such particular brilliance that would really make it a worthwhile recommendation but if, for some reason, your compelled to watch it, you could do a lot worse."
" Alexander is indeed terrible... the movie not so much
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,7,"I'll keep it short.
Ed Oxenbould's acting as Alexander is really BAD and feels so unnatural and forced.
Hopefully the movie doesn't mainly focus on Ed/Alexander and leaves more room to the other (more capable and competent) actors.
Overall it is a pleasant, undemanding family movie with some light humor.
The movie is quite short and doesn't excel in originality so you'll probably forget about it in a year or two.
Otherwise its a fine TV alternative to spend some time with your 6-10 years old kids.
I would rate it 6.5"
" Hilarious
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,10,I laughed harder than my kids during this movie. When it came out on dvd I mostly bought it for myself. We watched it with my husband this time and he doubled over laughing at the baby with the green highlighter. My kids liked the movie but I think parents will appreciate the movie even more.
" OK
",2020-11-05 00:00:00,6,"This movie relies on humour, and I found it too cringey and stupid to be very funny, but it was alright."
" Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad MOVIE
",2020-10-12 00:00:00,4,"In short , The title express all , this is a Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad movie , it is not just a waste of time or money , but also waste of nerves and energy , do yourselves a favor and never watch it ."
" Decent family film
",2020-08-12 00:00:00,6,"The cast is great. The acting is decent for the goofiness of the film. The plot is pretty average but started to get more and more interesting except the end was a big let down for me. The whole movie had a good rhythm of funny and random exciting things happening and then the end was cheesy and happy which i liked. But felt cut short and anti climatic. The film as a whole is still very much enjoyable and I would give it a 6.5/10.Overall:
A decent family film that has plenty of goofiness and laughs for the whole family."
" Very good family movie
",2020-07-05 00:00:00,10,"Very funny. Good for any age, and also a bit of fun for parents. Movie doesn't last too long, and the moral of the story is simple and the storyline is easy to understand. Really recommend."
" It is a pretty good movie
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,8,"It's a great movie for kids, but it always has to have gross parts. Like when it had to have the baby in no clothes. I loved it but it was very cheesy, but cute! I recommend this highly! ðŸ¤—"
" Decent movie
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,7,"There were a couple gross scenes, but overall the message was nice, the acting was terrific, and the family's relationship was amazing. I think it's worth a watch."
" A proper feel good family film
",2020-05-07 00:00:00,8,"This is a nice film to watch with the family. Funny moments follow one after the other, and the message is simple - we all have sh** to deal with but family is the most important component in our lives. Recommended viewing."
" Fun
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,7,Fun family movie about lots of mishaps. Good feel good movie. Have watched this multiple times. Enjoyable.
" Family fun!
",2020-03-07 00:00:00,8,"This is a great movie to watch with your family. It has a great cast, comedy, and heart felt moments. I love the whole concept of the movie You really feel for the family as they are going through the most stressful day of their life. And it shows what it means to be a family. Families stick together no matter the struggle.
This movie is a positive feel good movie and will make you smile."
" Having A Bad Day? This Movie Will Cheer You Up...
",2020-01-14 00:00:00,7,"Alexander is a 12 year old boy who is simply having a terrible day at school and at home. Alexander is also about to have a birthday party which is starting to look like a disappointment as another birthday party is happening on the same day and will be way better compared to what his family is planning for him. When Alexander complains about his terrible day to his family, they distractedly brush him off, telling him that he will be fine and it's not a big deal. But at 12:01am Alexander gets up early to celebrate his own birthday with a candle and one wish. He wishes the rest of his family could experience a bad day just like he had. As you can now expect, Alexander will experience one crazy day, witnessing all the bad and annoying things that happen to his family members, with many unpredictable moments surrounding him.For those who are not aware, this film is loosely based on a well known children's book and is a comedy film.The best part about this film is that it's straight up relatable. While I've never had gum in my hair, I've certainly had my fair share of bad and annoying days. The comedy and humour in this film also appeals to me. Firstly, the family characters are relatable as they all lead busy lives, but the actors who bring such fun and humour to the screen, particularly Alexander himself (played by Ed Oxenbould) and his father played by Steve Carell, are excellent.For a Disney film there is not a lot worth mentioning in regards to the film's audio and visual tracks as it's fairly basic. But my prime praise is for the positive message that comes at the end of the film and it's a message that I don't often see in film. It's not too ""preachy"" and in your face either, instead being surprisingly subtle considering the film's fast and wacky pace.Overall, maybe it is due to my sick sense of humour, but I personally enjoyed this Disney film. It's full of random jokes, silly humour and in the end it still manages to bring a touching message for all ages to enjoy. This type of key message is actually unlike most film's seen today. If you seek something brainless with wacky humour or perhaps you yourself have had a bad day, this could be the ticket to put a smile on your face and brighten your mood.7.0/10

" Disgusting from start to finish
",2019-11-21 00:00:00,1,"A comedy ""for the whole family"", pathetic since minute one. The lead actor Ed Oxenbould is one of the worst I've ever seen. His lack of comedic timing is hard to believe. Even trying it would be hard to be this unfunny. Carell and Garner suck bad too, leaving as only passable the performances from Minnette and Dorsey as typical annoying teenagers (not remarkable acting, but fine).Everything that happens is predictable. Jokes that weren't working anymore ten years before the movie was realized are the only ""fun"" parts in the movie.Material that is normally filler in a good comedy are the highlights in this horrendous movie. With all the greatness from Pixar for kids, or even classics from Disney (if as a parent you are ok with antiquated social norms), I just don't see how this atrocity could've any value for anybody."
" Pure comedy, straight to your face
",2019-08-21 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed it and it came to be a pretty good one. I was delighted and entertained by any funny scene possible and I bet you could'nt resist to laugh at them, too. It's simple & clean. It just brings the right jokes at the right times. Made my day, in a positive way."
" Great film - good energy
",2019-08-16 00:00:00,8,"I've seen this film a couple of times now, and I have to say that it is so very well done in many ways. The script and story is great - well paced. The dialogue flows without effort and is interesting and fun. The acting is superb - that goes for everyone! Great casting. You don't see that very often. Just look at Trevor! The little charm-goblin...The production and photography is superb. This is a film that is a joy to watch."
" What are you talking about? This is hilarious
",2019-07-18 00:00:00,8,"One, I never watch comedies for plot or message. I'm sure all of them have something to say, but please, for the love of God, if you want to produce a comedy, focus on the comedy. I still laugh at dramas and action movies but their label is still not primarily comedy.This is silly comedy and still better than most comedies that focus exclusively on sex and gross jokes just so they can look mature and smart. There are unfortunately not a lot of comedies like this one. It may be for kids but I did enjoy it a lot on my own, too.You should relax more before watching a comedy. If you've ever watched a family comedy before, you'll enjoy this too."
" Good, clean family fun.
",2019-07-15 00:00:00,8,"There's not really a lot that needs to be said about this movie. It is just a lot of fun and both kids and adults will find plenty to make them chuckle. There's plenty of 'slapstick' humor for the kids but it's all done so cleverly that adults will enjoy this movie just as much. An excellent cast of savvy adults and precocious kids work well together to portray a family that anyone would love to be a part of. The things that happen to them to make this, at first glance, one of the worst days ever will bring a smile to your face. It only goes for 81 minutes too, so littlies won't get bored and it doesn't overstay its welcome. See it."
" It's Â¿fun?
",2019-04-25 00:00:00,6,"In the movie all the parents are so positive and at some point, they are so frustrating.It wanna to say this going the movie boring. It's not like that, his funny the movie in some scenes."
" bad film idea.
",2019-04-10 00:00:00,1,"Doing a film on 10 page book is not a good idea since there is not enough plot to make a film on it. The acting was bad .
Stay a way from this film"
" IF YOU'RE HAPPY AND YOU KNOW IT CLAP YOUR HANDS
",2019-04-09 00:00:00,7,"Alexander (Ed Oxenbould) is having a bad day while his family is having a perfect day. Suddenly the tide turns. Alexander has a great day while everyone in his family is having a terrible, no good, bad day and in part due to things Alexander has done. However through it all, the family comes together and manage to overcome the bad times.This is a short film. This was a fun film to watch once, but I don't plan to sit through it a second time knowing what happens. A rental not a keeper.The unbelievable part was that a teen boy chooses to be with his embarrassing family over Bella Thorne."
" I like it, I don't like the trolls from there with those reviews!
",2019-02-15 00:00:00,7,"It's a good comedy, really don't have that much to say about ... the movie isnt bad at all, actually is pretty good.
A good and light comedy, perfect for a Friday night .. You, a bowl of popcorn and this movie its all you need.I personally liked it, and I do not regret watching it!"
" One for Steve Carrell to forget
",2019-02-01 00:00:00,3,This movie is an instantly forgettable film. Not many funny moments more silly than funny unfortunately.
" Perfection!
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,10,"Loved it and guaranteed that you will too! A family fun, funny and friendly movie - unpredicatable, perfect! enjoy"
" Normal movie
",2018-12-15 00:00:00,7,Good movie. The reason I'd give this a 7 out of ten is because at the beginning it was ok nothing happening that much much but in the end all the drama came into it. There's a valuable lesson in this about that bad days can turn into good days
" Meet the Parents for kids
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,6,"Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day is a harmless family movie. This movie is basically Meet the Parents for kids. It's over-the-top, but considering the audience they were going for, it works. If my kids wanted to watch it with me again, I wouldn't say no."
" Much cuter than the harsh reviews it's getting
",2018-11-21 00:00:00,7,"If you want Home Alone or Parenthood (1989) this isn't it. It's a cute movie wrapping a day of Murphy's Law into 124 minutes. It's honestly cute and if you like Diary of a Wimpy Kid (the original), you'll appreciate this. It's quick moving, but the acting of Jennifer Garner, Steve Carell make it work, and the young kids make it into a cute movie that will get some laughs.In 2018 you don't find many non-Oscar, non-Comic book, non-horror, non-R rated comedy movies, so for the few you get that actually aren't trainwrecks (ya know, like Father Figures), enjoy the few examples we have like this that just let you get a few goofy laughs and appreciate it for being just that.As a guy i remember being a 12 year old boy vividly. I never had siblings, but as someone who has memories of being 12, i appreciate this for what it is, and that's really all you should do and not over-think it"
" Funny and progressive
",2018-11-05 00:00:00,8,A very funny and easy to watch movie. Really liked the father taking care of the house while the mum was fighting for her career too. Very positiveand progressive messages in general.
" A good family movie!
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,8,"I watched with my nieces, we really enjoyed the film and discuss it after. Alexander was a character that represents so many kids in big busy families. I think the title spoiled the movie but it still great film with crazy and funny scenes, there's no twist or unexpected development in the story. The moral of the story is to always keep trying and never give up. The movie teach children that we all have bad days we should accept it it may help us to love and appreciate the good ones."
" The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078
",2017-05-20 00:00:00,8,"When something fresh and successful comes along, everyone wants a piece of it. Shortly following the films release, a number of copycats emerge and to be honest most of them are terrible. Maybe it's because we tend to compare it to the original or maybe it's because the scripts are rushed and just aren't that good. In any case, after the release of the Wimpy Kid series, we saw a lot of these family comedies, centering on the not so popular kids, and as expected, most of them were awful, with one notable exception. Alexander's bad day focuses on a young man whose birthday coincides with his first day of middle school, which doesn't go so well. After receiving no sympathy from his family, Alexander wishes that they all had their own bad day, and the results were hilarious. This isn't the typical PG family comedy you see from Disney, as it was quite raunchy for them and really pushes the boundary of that PG rating. Ed Oxenbould stars as Alexander and fits the role like a glove. Oxenbould looks and sounds kind of awkward, after all it is a strange age, but watching him gave the feeling that he's not all that unfamiliar with being unpopular. Possibly playing on real life experience, he rivals Alex Gordon with a performance that was not only believable, but it was also very funny. Another advantage this film has over the Wimpy Kid series is that the young cast has help from some of Hollywood's elite, as co-stars include Steve Carell and Jennifer Garner. The pair give a lot of support and the producers use them to break-up the middle school monotony that would has surely ensued. While not my usual genre, I loved the Wimpy kid series, but Alexander's bad day is more than an adequate alternative for those who are looking for something a little bit different."
" Terrible, horrible, no good, very bad review!
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,1,#This movie is very crude and it has parts in it where the people are being mean. It has bad language In it as well. Ther is a scene in the movie where it shows a baby's bottom. And another scene in it where there is throwing up. And another scene when the older boy breaks up with a girl. Very inappropriate movie. Review by Josh at the age of eleven.
" light family move
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,6,nice light family movie show the importance of the family and positives and show that you can extract the good from any bad day or worst situationnice way to show the funny events through the movie nice casting in summary the movie have all the element of watchable good movie nothing much to say about it
