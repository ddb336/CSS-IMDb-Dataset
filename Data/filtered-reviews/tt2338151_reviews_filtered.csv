" Could have done so much
",2021-04-02 00:00:00,8,"I really liked this movie as long as it wanted me to like it. In the beginning we are introduced to an unnamed alien who has come to earth to see what life on the planet is like. But then his remote gets stolen and he has to learnt to adapt to the lifestyle of humans.He is very confused about the way humans live. He can't understand the purpose behind clothes, money, language, gestures and finally, religion. And that's where I have a problem with this movie. Don't get me wrong. I'm not gonna talk those ""why is only one religion being talked about"" arguments. Rather my problem is why is religion being given so much emphasis? If I were to make this movie, I'd focus more on the people's lifestyle, which is exactly what the movie was going with and occasionally tries coming back to (like the condom scene).The songs, the acting, the colour palette, everything about the visual and audio was fantastic. The scene in which Jaggu wants to come out of jail made me pause the video so that I could laugh properly. The problems come up in the second half, where the sense of humour suddenly finishes and it starts turning more dramatic. The serious scenes don't hit the same way as the comedy scenes do. After all, we are watching a movie about an alien adjusting to earth's lifestyle. It should have a lot more humour than a grim, gritty feeling.It was fun to watch, but I don't see myself watching this ever again. I know it won't be as funny on seeing the second time. And that's why I'd only recommend it to you if you aren't the ""religion good"" type and can actually see a movie with an open mind, because nowadays a lot of negativity is being spread about this movie."
" Only dumb people like this logicless movie
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,2,Even you are athiest its nothing to like this movie because why any indian girl loves to marry pakistani guy feel wonder. Just imagine the situation if this made up as indian hindu boy and pakistani girl.Although first half is great. Second half is pretty boring. Climax part last 40 minute smakes it as worst. I cannot understand how this movie became big hit.Only bashing onebreliguon without discussing in objective manner.
" Copy from South Korean Movie
",2021-01-22 00:00:00,1,"I loved P.K movie before but I have wached the South Korean movie ""Superman ieotdeon sanai (2008)"" last week. I saw all the PK sceenes and I was shoked! They need to write at least korean screenplay writers name on the details of PK movie. What is this? Rajkumar Hirani copied everything from this movie. They only added the religion stuffs. Now I don't believe that Rajkumar Hirani can make a movie without copying. I am a big Bollywood fan but I'm so disappointed now."
" Insult Hindu's Religion
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,1,"This movie insult sanatan dharma feeling, aamir khan also a D-grade actor who insult Hindu's God"
" Insulting Hindu Gods
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,1,This movie is targeting on Hindu Gods. Criticizing our culture. Killing the feelings of Hindus. Amirkhan always ready to go against our country and Hinduism.
" Cut it some slack and enjoy its many virtues
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,8,"High production values, good actors, fine choreography of the dance scenes, good music; as an American who lived in India for four years I had to cut the film some slack with regards to its ""message"", but overall found it quite worthwhile. The English subtitles need improvement, but are passably OK."
" Hinduphobic
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,1,Hurting hindus emotion is now a hobby of islamicwood(bollywod)
" It's hurting emotions
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,1,This film is a real example of islamicwood(bollywood of india).this film characterised lord shiva as helpless and running for help due to an alien coming from a planet in the universe which was created by lord shiva this islamic wood have no guts to show islamic priests/god or Xtian priest/god in such a condition otherwise we all know they will be beheaded
" Anti hindu propaganda
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,1,It mocks hindu gods. Stop hinduphobia karachi wood.
" Boring movie
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,1,"Boring movie only propaganda
As usual Hindu religion is up for bending breaking Under the garb of creative freedom Bully learn from west where they appreciate our religion try to learn about it not bend it or break it"
" Made to disrespect hindu god and hindu dharm
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,1,"Nothing was good in this movie. From the beginning till end , amir khan only try to show how bad is hindu religion and it's practises are."
" Mocks every religion except E-slam
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,1,"Full propaganda against hindus. There was not even a glimpse of the actor mocking Islam in mosque, other all religions were mocked. Soft influencing as they do!"
" Wonderful
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,9,"Wonderful,must watch,its a good effort by aamir&rajkumar hirani"
" 2 stars because this is anti hindu movie
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,2,2 stars only for ssr also this is a anti hindu movie and whether it is Amir Khan or Anushka Sharma both have did nothing to make the movie good also this movie hated not only my religious sentiments but also of many
" Trash
",2020-12-22 00:00:00,1,Its hinduphobic and serves up jihadi agenda of the #BullyDaWeed gang.
" Hinduphobic
",2020-12-16 00:00:00,1,"It's totally a hinduphobic & propoganda movie,
Bollywood your time is overnow."
" Manipulating Movie
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,1,This movie hurts everybody's feelings in one way or another. You should not make such movie that targets only one religion. Why didn't you show other religions that has same types of superstitions. Let's take an example. Like Hindus have temples muslims have mosques and mosques use peacocks feathers to clean tombs and god knows how many peacocks they killed to make those brooms. So please show that too. If you're showing facts about one religion then why don't you start with your own first.
" Bloody Hindu phobic
",2020-12-05 00:00:00,1,Hate this movie ðŸ˜¡ content is bloody Hindu phobic.
" No comedy
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,1,"Very poor taste of Bollywood, do not find it entertaining....I love Amir in dangal n laggan,but in this film he done overacting.... please don't make these type of movies ...save us from Bollywood"
" Silly, deep and thought provoking.
",2020-11-27 00:00:00,10,"One of the best Indian movies I've ever seen. It's extremely funny, it's quite similar to Mr. Bean, but much better, since it has much more than comedy. The storyline is very interesting, something similar was done before many times, but this is the very best execution for sure. It has tons of drama and romance too and if it wasn't enough it also deals with serious issues and thought provoking themes of many kinds. Truly impressive work."
" Insulting Hindu sentiments
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,1,God Mahadev has shown like coward.If Mr Amir Khan had dare to show God or proffet of peaceful like this then he mightn't Alive today.Bloody hypocrite
" Hinduphobic, brainwashing
",2020-11-19 00:00:00,1,You will never find the most Hinduphobic content than this movie. Its strategically involved hinduphobic content to demean only one set of people ie Hindus. Its unfortunate that we Hindus liked this movie instead of understanding the deep deception.
" PK
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,10,"Best movie ever, not for butthurt Hollywood fans,who always says movie has been copied from Hollywood."
" Utter nonsense
",2020-11-11 00:00:00,1,Not much comedy.. just few childish jokes. SSR is simply the best.
" Hinduphobic
",2020-11-10 00:00:00,1,"Terrible film.""Humor"" is entirely based on blatant Hindu-bashing and insulting Hindu traditions. Encourages anti-Hindu stereotypes.Puts cheap allegations on ancient dharma that is patently false and more applicable to 'Religion of Peace' .Claims to 'question religion', but in reality all 'questions' are only for Hindus. Entirely coincidental that main actor's surname is 'Khan' and Bollywood is known for films where only evil Hindus oppose inter-religion marrige where Hindu woman converts to Islam."
" great
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,10,"Felt it with flesh and bone, i am not talking just about the movie it self but what was behind it, living in a country filled with religious stupidity you would feel this every day of your life, but the movie it self was good enough"
" Anti Hindu
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,1,Anti hindu movie. Such movies should be boycotted. Worst message from this movie
" Philosophical Kontradictions...
",2020-10-24 00:00:00,10,"Amongst the most brilliant, engaging, original, funny and honest pieces of cinema I've had the pleasure to absorb. Absolutely rammed full of cultural and religious observations regarding their contradictions and their inconsistencies - if you're not too devout to any of them you will simply adore this and, if you are, then hopefully it goes some way to prizing open your lid of intransigence and dogma, just enough to allow a chuckle and a giggle at how seriously we sometimes take ourselves. With the celestial Aamir Khan and the heavenly Anushka Sharma to tow us along, they provide all the divination you need to settle back and enjoy this phenomenally entertaining piece of outlandishness and joy."
" great Indian film
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,8,"In Bruges, Indian Hindu woman Jaggu falls in love with Pakistani Muslim man Sarfaraz. Her father disapproves of his religion and his guru Tapasvi Ji predicts that Sarfaraz will betray her. She asks him to marry her anyways but at the church, she receives a Dear John note telling her not to call him. Heart broken, she returns to New Delhi and becomes a tabloid reporter. One day on the subway, she encounters PK passing out flyers looking for God. He has the craziest tale to tell.Aamir Khan looks a bit like Rowan Atkinson. His comedic parentage runs along the Buster Keaton line. His muscular physique probably helps in his body humor. He's got a fun wackiness despite the intense weird face. The plot is surprisingly deep and the religious concepts are interesting. This is both hilarious and heartwarming. I do wonder if it would be better to not reveal his alien nature until much later. The audience should be dismissive like Jaggu at the beginning. The anniversary dinner is the perfect turning place with that reveal. Before that, his stories should be Jaggu shaking her head in disbelief. As for the ending, I would prefer to have crows and him not returning. The batteries don't make sense if he's coming back anyways. This is great."
" Total Nonsense!
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,1,Just Defaming Hindus That's All.... total Bulls*it.
" American in love
",2020-09-18 00:00:00,9,"This film gave me my love of Indian ""Bollywood"" movies. I'd love to visit if only to experience the facinating religious culture that exists and that I'd studied quite throughly before even trying this movie. I don't quite know what caused me to even try this movie out after seeing it at the library but I sure am glad I did. Aamir Khan is amazing and I'm glad to have experienced him. Wonderfully insightful."
" He found it.
",2020-09-17 00:00:00,8,"The story was beautiful and quality. The flow was good, the script was good, it connected with sadness towards the end, I was impressed. The alien had 'logical' and 'real explanations' for humans. Let's look for the creator from an alien. I agree with the alien's inference, ""there are two gods. One created us, you created the other."""
" Dnt watch this movie..worst worst worst
",2020-09-17 00:00:00,1,Worst movie i have seen in my entire life...dnt watch movie
" Funny and unique
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,9,Alien concept in a film is used mainly for action or science fiction. But this time it has very different theme that is comedy. Aamir khan's expressions are so enjoyable and funny that u will never get bored. First half is funny and second half is damn emotional. Rajkumar Hirani and Abhijat Joshi are gem. Anushka Sharma has also done a great job. There are some cliffhangers as well.
" Anti-hindu and anti-national
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,1,They destroyed Sushant Singh Rajput. They target only one religion for their systematic propaganda
" Amir khan and gang bollywood is Hindu phobic
",2020-08-28 00:00:00,1,Amir khan and gang bollywood is Hindu phobic in movie they intentially hurts hindu sentiments and I never see bolly Wood movies
" Waste of time
",2020-08-26 00:00:00,1,PK is full of prejudices towards hinduism.On few occasions the depiction is spot on but most of the times it is far from reality and highlighting the bad practices and making fun of only a specific religion while leaving others.So all and all it's an agenda driven movie. Criticizing and mocking only Hinduism in bollywood has become fashion I guess.
" A great first half, fizzles in the middle and an underwhelming climax
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,7,"The first is is entertaining, filled with laughter, not slapstick, but genuine comedy arised from awkward situations. As the story moves forward it becomes messy; it starts as story of pk and we religion and god through his eyes, this part is very brilliantly written, then at one point become confused if it's about his life, commentry on god or jaggu's personal life. There are two love stories, one is important to the story, other plays a spoilsport.Some of the arguments by pk are taken frim Oh My God (2012). Like when pk files F. I. R against god, and his analogy that a father (god alike) will never his son to himalayas to fulfill his demands, the scene where he makes a temple out of a stone and people calling out fake Sadhu's after his interview, but with an additional phrase, ""wrong number"". In a way, they don't have their own arguments in their theory of god.One thing it brilliantly does is highlighting some of the holes in modern theory of religion, some facts that everybody knows but keep ignoring.End of the review.Unpopular opinion : Aamir Khan played an alien here. We don't know how aliens behave. In first half, he didn't show human like expressions and kept a 'confused' look throughout. In second, story gets dramatic, and he displays emotions like humans. Although he recieved praise for his performance, he was weak, especially in last few scenes. But that's mainly because of the way the character was written."
" Worst movie
",2020-08-21 00:00:00,1,This movie is our Hindu religion against. They are showing this waste movie with mental hero and mental action
" Ignorance and innocence are pivotal and maybe an important aspect in our spiritual journey
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,8,"What worked:
the screenplay; it's a beautiful movie with an very challenging topic, which is in itself dubious and very bold. I must say when I watched the movie for the first time, I was so much disappointed with the movie overall, almost to the degree of hate and disgust primarily because of the critical subject matter that the makers touched on. I was displeased because I thought the maker Rajkumar Hirani is taking a propaganda of religion for his movie which should not have been made in the first place. It's only after the multiple viewing that I realized that the movie was not targeting the god and religion but the malpractice related with them. Overall, it's a glamorous, funny, moving and glorified Hirani movie with his humor and entertainment package.What did not work:
plotholes and flaws; the movie is not without any flaws and loopholes. Some common questions were- how didn't PK know about condom when in fact he transferred the language from a women in the very occupation she has mastered. Instead, the makers could have edited the writing with maybe she stopped letting him hold her hand or something as a result he was partially informed.runtime and glorified scenes; I am sure songs could have been taken out or cut down for editing the runtime. I think the scenes with PK's love interest is not needed for the movie. Many scenes in the movie are glorified for entertainment purposes which could have been avoided. Also, at the end of the day I would not want to see a movie dealing with religious sentiments although the intent is not made regarding the religion. We cannot unsee scenes which were mean for comic purposes but have hurt the sentiments, at least for me. Even though not meant to harm, they somehow challenge us.Final verdict: only watch if you can take religious standup comedies, and of course if you can take the movie topic lightly. The overall message of the movie is rational but the narrative is not always pleasant."
" Only For Sushant Singh Rajput
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,10,This Review Is Only For Sushant Singh Rajput'S Performance He Is Shining Like A Star In P.K
" hatred for hindus
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,1,Hindu pobhia movie only 99percent of time only hindus were target like they are stupid people who worship god but they did not show how muslim read 5 times namaz
" Very Touching
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,9,"The content of the movie is a very sensitive one. Love for God, which when human beings try and condense in words, unfortunately turns into dogmatic Religion. Director Rajkumar Hirani has tried to bring forth this philosophy in an extremely entertaining manner. The cast has done a brilliant job. All in all a fantastic movie."
" Best ever movie
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,9,"One of the great movie i have ever seen, his character just mind blowing and a message from this movie i really think people should understand this and learn something from this"
" Best movie forever

" Pk Is Best Comedy Movie.!
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,8,Funny Scenes Fully.. I was saw this movie many times..
" Scratching the surface with lot of cliches.
",2020-07-15 00:00:00,1,"This fare of an alien would've better if the treatment was of self discovery & love rather than cliches about various scenarios. They only scratch the surface. Read about Advait, Dhyan & other deeper philosophies/truths prevalent as undercurrent rather than stupidity shown."
" One time watchable
",2020-07-13 00:00:00,2,It's one of those one time watchable movies. This movie has some dumb logic and intends to insult a section of the society with comparisons and dialogues that doesn't make sense. So it's okay okay movie
" Right Questions
",2020-07-10 00:00:00,8,"This movie echoes many people's mindset and we may get upset if our beliefs are questioned by this movie. Either you take it or not, this movie slaps our ideologies and may be time to rethink about us."
" Not Recommended ðŸ‘Ž
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,1,"Very desperate, I liked how Bollywood agressively and sometimes very softly target Hinduism, being living in a hindu majority still most hindus will not even understand what this movie is actually trying to potrade..."
" PK- An Alien's View on Human Race Absurdities
",2020-07-02 00:00:00,9,"PK is about an alien / humanoid who lands from spaceship to study about earth, but is left stranded as his gadget to connect to his spaceship is stolen. In his journey of search he experience absurdity of human race w.r.t. religions, customs, languages, attire, practices, notions, and so on. The movie shows mankind from an alien point of view and what he takes from humans and learns on earth is lying at the end."
" I watched this with no subtitles and no knowledge of the language
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,8,I still thought it was funny. I watched this in India when it had just come out and my mother (the only one who knew the language) attempted to translate for the first ten minutes.
" Stale Jokes
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,1,"Yes I'm writing this years later after watching the movie.I still can't get my head around the positive reviews on this one. The worst thing is Anushka's acting. Poor acting especially in the scenes where humor is forced. Feels like everybody is waiting on cue, to fake laugh. It feels like even the actors did not have fun making the movie. So boring had to skip certain scenes. We sat looking at each other's faces wondering how did this possibly even manage a 5 out of 10. Either ratings are rigged or standards have dropped. One of the topmost overrated movies of all times."
" A daring philosophical movie creatively made to become entertaining and knowledgeable
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,9,"This movie has a powerful story which reflects real-life events and social issues despite its fictional nature. The characters have developed well through time and their development provided interesting ideas and opinions that the movie wants to convey to the viewers. Creators of this movie were daring enough to voice out an opinion which is usually unheard of because of the criticisms they might receive or the sensitivity of this subject. The actors on this movie have given justice to their roles as well, they were able to adapt to the characters their play and gave me the genuineness on acting.I can relate well to the wonders of PK regarding religions; true enough, there are various factors which remain questionable on the practice of faith in different religions. The situations they have presented in the movie were also realistic that I have even experienced such disunion and conflict due to varying beliefs."
" Only for Sushant Singh Rajput
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,8,I watched this movie only for Sushant Singh Rajput and this rate only for Sushant not for all because i like the acting of Sushant Singh Rajput best of all
" A Comedy Gold from Bollywood
",2020-06-15 00:00:00,10,"Have seen this over 100 times and still can & will.
My 2nd favourite film of all time right below 3 Idiots. Have almost all lines memorised by heart.The fish-out-of-water story is one the best comedy and it's witty remarks of social normality is fantastically written and executed.Every side character is great and has something special to do. Some comedy sequence 'Condom drop', 'Stone God Money Machine', 'Dancing Car' will never be forgotten from my brain.The director beautiful gives us a underling theme & social commentary about religious misconducts while also providing a masterful entertainment piece to laugh at, perfectly balanced as everything should be( pun intended)One the greatest movie from Bollywood with classic sub-plots of romance,comedy and entertainment."
" All things is right direction cinematography but the plot hurts many
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,1,Why its against one religion through out the whole plot. south indian movies worship lord shiva while here in bollywood all gods are being given a bad image if this was against other belief their would have been riots
" Must watch this movie.
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,10,"The storyline and the dialogues are amazing. It is very mind opening, educating and entertaining. Also... Amir khan is back with another amazing act.
Just watch itz"
" Aamir Khan is back with yet another top notch act again!!!
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,10,"Very nice, educating and entertaining movie.
Pk teaches us how we should view religion- a way to reach God, not to sheepishly follow people who their belly is their god"
" Best movie

" Average
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,7,Too long like all he Indian movies around but better than some other 10.000 other Indian Movie as well. i was waiting something better actually but still i believe Aamir Khan has different mentality than other Indian movie predictors.
" Awesome Story lines.... Must watch

" great movie
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,10,""" PK ""Director: Rajkumar Hirani Cast: Aamir Khan, Anushka Sharma, Boman Irani, Sushant Singh Rajput, Sanjay Dutt.Rajkumar Hirani is back in the multiplexes after a five-year hiatus and the wait has been worth it.PK, the writer-director's fourth directorial venture, is a wonderful piece of cinema that, pretty much like his much-loved Munnabhai films, blends heart and head with commendable mastery .PK is a fearless critique of religious bigotry and the ways of India's proliferating Godmen, but the film's message is shorn of rancour and bitterness. It is instead cloaked in humanity and humour, which accentuates its impact no end.The screenplay, written by Hirani and Abhijat Joshi, takes make-believe elements on one hand and draws upon the realities of our times on the other to deliver a fantasy so unique and original that it takes your breath away.PK delivers an entertaining tale that touches upon the social and political ills that plague us but it does so without falling out of line with the need to keep the story simple and straightforward.PK is a film that restores one's faith in the much maligned Bollywood idiom. It demonstrates that the so-called clichÃ©d conventions of Mumbai's popular cinema can, in hands as able as Hirani's, yield entertainment of the very highest pedigree.The film opens in the desert of Rajasthan where a stark naked alien (Aamir Khan) alights from a spaceship looking lost and forlorn. He belongs to a planet where clothing is unheard of and words as we earthlings know them are redundant because its inhabitants need nothing more than pure thaughts to communicate.A theft leaves him stranded and the extra-terrestrial begins a search for the remote control device that he needs to communicate with his spaceship. His adventures on earth bring him in contact with a jovial Rajasthani band master Bhairon Singh (Sanjay Dutt), a spunky television journalist Jaggu Sahni (Anushka Sharma), and a greedy head of a religious cult, Tapasvi Maharaj (Saurabh Shukla).He learns how to survive on our hostile planet, but what he imparts to those he meets along the way is far more valuable than anything that the latter can give him. PK is a film that is marked by purity of vision and precision of storytelling. It is funny, feel-good and thaught provoking .Thanks to the finely etched characters that they are called upon to play, the actors have their jobs significantly simplified. They do not need to rise above the level of the writing. The benchmark is set for them, and they simply have to ensure that they measure up. All of them do just that. Aamir Khan is of course the dynamo that propels the narrative, but Anushka Sharma, too, gives it her best shot. Sushant Singh Rajput plays only a minor role in the film as the heroine's Pakistani boyfriend from her days in Bruges, Belgium, but he makes the most of the limited opportunities that he gets.The villain in PK isn't your average Bollywood baddie. He is a godman who thrives on the incredulity of his followers, but when confronted with the prospect of being shamed on the set of a television show, he does not unleash a battery of goons as such characters are wont to do in a Hindi movie.PK is, after all, a Rajkumar Hirani film, and nothing that it delivers hinges on devices that have done to death. It springs surprises at every turn, not the least among of which is a very special appearance by Ranbir Kapoor.This is an absolutely unmissable mass entertainer, if ever there has been one. It is unlikely that you will ever be more entertained and more enlightened - both at the same time - by a Bollywood film."
" education through entertainment
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,9,"From an outsider 's perspective, the film peeks into the ecological fabric of India 's society and dissects sensitive issues in a popular way. BTW I like Aamir Khan."
" Worth every delicious minute
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,10,"I don't usually have enough patience for foreign language films. The idea for PK intrigued me and each scene kept me savoring every morsel of dialog, acting and cinematography.This is an artful masterpiece well worth seeing multiple times. At 2Â½ hours I feared it might drag in places, but even as the movie was ending I wanted more, sad that it was ending already.Thank you -- actors, director, writer and everyone else involved in this work of art.This gem has its share of wonderful surprises -- the humor, the logic, the dialog, the humanity and a truly satisfying ending."
" It should not be a top 250 movie
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,1,"I am on a mission to watch all top 250 movies. Unfortunately I had to take my time to watch this movie. It is a poor attempt of comedy, with jokes of poor taste. It is hard for me to evaluate or give bad reviews, but I had to give another bad review. This movie steals a spot on top250 of great movies that deserve way it more. I am sorry, but this is my review..."
" good movie
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,8,"The music is very good. Good Indian songs. The front is very funny, but in the end I watched it with tears. Extraterrestrials PK to get other people's love. Take a box of batteries in order to be able to hear the voice of the heroine all the time, it's very touching! It's a good movie."
" THE BEST BOLLYWOOD EXPERIENCE EVER!!!
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,10,"Today, I was reminded why this is my top Bollywood film tied with 3 Idiots. PK was a gospel disguised as an entertainment! Even if I did not go to church this Holy Thursday, the realizations I made and the blessings I received were enough. Sure, there were a lot of concepts on the verge of being cringe-y but they never showed a hint of hesitation and embarrassment. What anyone could feel was the immense level of mastery each had to observe to make all the elements- directing, photography, writing, music, dance, acting- work perfectly. Everything was on point, to say the least.As a Catholic in a highly conservative country, this hit too close to home. I practice my faith like most people do but I wouldn't say I'm as devout as others. All the questions PK raised and practices confronted were valid. And I think about them ever since I was young. I felt seen that this has already transcended as an extension of my principles. The real challenge for me now is to keep on calling or else I would never know if it's the correct or wrong number at all. It wouldn't hurt as well to call out the propagators of hatred now that the world is getting more discriminatory and violent by the day. It's awful but it gives me hope that this kind of art exists for everyone to reflect upon. It might be a film today but who knows it might be the universal practice tomorrow- or in the near future. I can only pray or anticipate the next alien landing."
" What a waste of time.

" Not worthy of its position
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,2,Honestly I don't really understand how this movie could get a place in the top 250 movies list. I was cringing the whole time which as expected from an Indian movie was not a short time to be cringing about. The alien part was really stupid and not really important at all actually in the movie as it focused more on religion which I don't mind but the questions asked by PK were mostly oversimplified. The jokes were uncomfortably lame and the acting just plain bad. Otherwise the production isn't bad at all as I expected and the songs are good enough. I mostly like Indian movies for I'm learning about their culture more and understand it better but really that only doesn't justify its place for me in the top list.

" it is destiny

" PK
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,8,"The issue of religion, race, class, belief and politics in India is discussed in the form of light comedy. Not only that, but also interspersed with laughing alien adventures + Indian singing and dancing, can be said to be both deep and entertaining. Ps. Amir is also good, feeling that he has contracted all the best Indian films in recent years."
" PK
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,8,"This film ostensibly speaks of the multi-religious situation in India. Everyone wears different clothes, dresses differently, and believes in different disciplines. In fact, from my point of view, it is talking about a person's faith, where is God, and how do we transcode."
" A responsible movie ,a responsible director
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,9,"This is a typical Indian film. The movie is telling a story. Maybe the story of aliens coming to earth and losing and retrieving the remote control of the spacecraft is not attractive enough, but PK's screenwriter and director tells the story wonderfully. Many people have turned their attention to the religious beliefs of the film's large-scale interpretation. It is true that in India, a religious country where there are more people going to temples than going to school, it is a great thing to make such a film that criticizes real religion. The director showed his cognition about the relationship between people, the relationship between groups and groups, the relationship between class and class, and the relationship between people and beliefs in the film through exaggerated humor. It can be seen that he obviously hopes Indian society can change."
" Thanks for respecting the emotional line
",2020-03-22 00:00:00,10,"There are many movies and TV plays that let other people's logic collapse to death in order to let men and women stay together.Thank you for respecting the heroine's emotional line in this film.She did not fall in love with the alien hero because of force majeure, but still loved the person she loved.Thank you. Thank you for not putting weird stuff in a good movie."
" Independent thinking
",2020-03-17 00:00:00,9,"Running away from problems doesn't give people a sense of security. In fact, only by acknowledging your ignorance and trying to figure out how to solve it, can you be an independent thinker. And when the habitual thinking that has been used to relying on experience meets the impact of rational thinking, it is inevitable to panic. However, no matter how strong the struggle is, it is meaningless and will eventually be assimilated by the light of independent thinking."
" Meaningful

" Funny alien...
",2020-02-28 00:00:00,6,"""PK"" is a Comedy - Fantasy movie in which we watch an alien coming on Earth but loses a device he has in order to be able to communicate with his spaceship. His behavior and the child-like questions he asks makes the whole country reconsider and start evaluating the true impact of religion on people.I liked this movie because it was really funny and made me think how easy is to change something or reconsider it when you ask the right questions. Aamir Khan who played as PK was for one more time simply amazing and also the interpretation of Anushka Sharma who played as Jagat Janani / Jaggu was equally good. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because it's funny and I am sure that will make you laugh a lot. I am also sure that you will like a lot PK."
" Great
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,10,"To make this short and quick, PK is a movie which includes drama and comedy. It focuses on a very serious topic using those two categories to further advance the plot. I recommend this movie for anyone who has watched any other movies of Rajkumar Hirani's, as well as to any one who finds satirical comedies interesting to watch. Once you watch the movie for yourself you might agree with me, that the movie delivers on what it has to offer."
" One of the worst movie I have ever seen.
",2020-02-20 00:00:00,1,"I expected a lot more from this movie and the people who were involved in making this movie. I agree to the exposing of fake gurus and those trying to make money off of religion etc.. It seems this movie was about attacking Hinduism and the people who follow it. Seriously! I agree with some points, but it could have been done a heck of a lot better.
Religion has become a business for many and it's not just the Hindus. Religion as a whole is about power and control of the masses..nothing spiritual about it. I was waiting, that perhaps PK would meet a real Swami/Yogi who would guide him or provide some answers to him..but didn't happen. But unfortunately, as per the movie honest Hindu's or honest Hindu spiritual leaders do not exist,lol.
The movie goes out of it's way to poke fun at Hinduism and the people who follow it....and in the end PK says ' I believe in a God that created us'. What a big big joke. I literally had to laugh out loud as I thought to myself 'that's it?' This Alien believes in a God who created us..then that would mean he is not different from the rest of them he was poking fun of. In order for a 'God to create us', then it must be a separate being, which as HIndusim has thought me, is that the energy that became everything is right here present within me. ""aham brahmasami' Don't forget the relationship with Anushka and the Pakistani Muslim guy, another joke. If the character was really a Pakistani Muslim, then there is no way he would marry a Hindu girl from India...unless he denounces his religion and family. Get real people.Conclusion.This movie goes out of it's way to poke fun at Hinduism, without exploring what Hinduism is really all about. It does expose the fake guru's etc, but fake guru's are not Hinduism. This just goes to show how out of touch this so called 'bollywood' really is. I expected a lot more from Aamir Khan."
" Makes you re-interpretate your beliefs
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,8,A daring film. Makes you think of the facts that you belief since your childhood. Enlightens the reality of Gods. With such a serious topic the film manages to be hilarious and emotional and inspiring at the same time....... Strongly Recommended

",2020-01-13 00:00:00,10,"Very unfamiliar with Bollywood and its protagonists, but I took a chance on this film, and I have to say-it contains an extremely powerful message. This film possesses a lot of HEART. I laughed, I cried, and everything in between. I loved it so much I recommended it to friends right away. I even told them I would buy their tickets. This film is a multi-topic piece that, we, as humans (no matter where we are from) should seek answers to. The main characters in the film are very expressive and communicate its content effectively. I believe in this movie and its essence. Awesome-hands down the best film I have seen. Well done on this film, well done. Ten stars."
" True reflection of today's Indian societies and their pointless believes.

" Really Sensation Movie
",2019-11-29 00:00:00,10,"Complete dazzling and tried to give a very good message. Aamir Khan act was really SENSATION. Somehow, way and script were upright. I can say that it is a must watch movie for all movie lovers because the message this movie gives is incredible."
" A VERY GOOD WATCH !!
",2019-10-27 00:00:00,8,"After the stupendous success of 3 Idiots which highlighted the maladies of an education system built on rote en route to setting new benchmarks of box-office success, in PK, the team of Rajkumar Hirani & Aamir Khan, put the multi-billion dollar industry called religion in their cross hairs.PK is an alien from a distant galaxy who lands in the middle of the desert in Rajasthan in a spaceship to study earth and its inhabitants. However, soon after landing on earth in the buff, he is divested of his remote - an exotic looking medallion - through which he can communicate to his spaceship to return to his planet. The stolen remote is purchased by Delhi based godman, Tapasvi Baba (Saurabh Shukla) who intends to use it to milk more money from his devotees for a grand temple project.PK follows the remote to Delhi and, on his way, is assisted by Bhairo Singh (Sanjay Dutt), a band leader in Rajasthan and Jaggu aka Jagatjanani (Anushka Sharma), a Delhi based TV journalist. There is a minor subplot involving a truncated romance between Jaggu and Sarfaraz (Sushant Singh Rajput), a Pakistani student, when they meet in Belgium.Using the curious eyes of a being from another world, ignorant of the ways of our world, the director raises several valid questions on religions - man-made paths to God - as well as to godmen - those self anointed custodians of the faith who enrich themselves in the name of salvation and instant solutions by preying on the fears and weaknesses of their devotees. Though most of these questions are neither new nor, by any measure, daring and have already been part of the recent Paresh Rawal movie, Oh My God, Hirani and Aamir approach the subject with sincerity and Hirani's trademark zest which is appealing to the viewers and makes an instant connect.
Aamir, despite his continuing penchant to over-act, is excellent as the bumbling alien who tries to make sense of the multiple contradictions - hypocrisies which are accepted norms of our everyday life - that confound him. Anushka Sharma has an effervescent presence and lights up the screen in every scene she appears. Rajkumar Hirani regulars Sanjay Dutt, Boman Irani, Parikshit Sahani, Saurabh Shukla along with Sushant Singh Rajput are effective in their minor cameos.PK has its fair share of flaws in the form of a rushed up romance in the first act that is dovetailed into a contrived climax of the third act which stick out as out of place appendages. The length of the movie could also have been clipped by 20 minutes at least to make it more crisper. While Hirani might have wanted to depict PK as a commoner, he could have still avoided the thick Bhojpuri accent for PK which is tacky and hampers clear understanding of his lines. The movie is in its elements in the middle portion when PK is on his exploratory quest throwing up common sense questions on the absurdities that confront him. Yet, The songs, while not chart busters, gel well with the narrative. While there is no doubt that Hirani's movies deal with issues which are socially relevant and his tone of communication despite being evocative, remains benign, one gets the feeling that, in PK, Hirani seems satisfied having barely scratched the surface of an important issue and that, in a sense, could account for a less than fulfilled sense when you leave the movie.Overall, PK is a brave attempt (perhaps, not brave enough) - and a cinematic SUCCESS as it packages an important message by flagging several hypocrisies and inanities that baffle us in the garb of religion, rituals, accepted norms and conventions into an entertaining movie with a healthy dose of fun."
" It started out as a joke...
",2019-10-26 00:00:00,9,So I saw a clip from this movie on TikTok and thought what the heck is this? I figured it would be The Room level entertaining. Like watching a train wreck. So I found the movie on YouTube with English subtitles and started watching it. I was laughing at first. Couldn't wait to share this little nugget I found with my friends (I was the one in our group who discovered The Room as well). But it wasn't long into the movie before I realized I wasn't watching it as a joke anymore. I was watching it because I was actually intrigued by it. I literally knew nothing about this movie going into it. I watched it because of a TikTok video. But I'm honestly really glad I found it. This crazy movie is actually really good and has an awesome message. Everything you see in the movie has significance down the line. It was really a wonderful film to watch and I would recommend it to anyone.
" Fun and entertaining but also simplistic
",2019-10-24 00:00:00,8,Rating6/10Fun film packed with potshots against religion. Well acted and entertaining to a point. After a while the film begins to feel simplistic as it chooses obvious fakes to expose. The director's anti religion slant feels too one sided.
" Without labels
",2019-10-12 00:00:00,9,"""we are people without label, the religion only separate"" The message most important about this movie."
" Excellent comedy, so-so drama
",2019-10-01 00:00:00,6,"I've seen quite a few Indian films now, and this is the first one so far that I might actually rewatch one day, though I'd stop watching after the first half.After the intro's background, the first half of the movie is a comedy that had me laughing out loud. Khan acts the perfect picture of a goofy alien, and PK's questions and thought process were genuinely funny. The movie concept of someone placed in a new culture they don't understand isn't a new one, but PK certainly adds its own unique spin.However, the second half changes tune and becomes part drama and part philosophical think piece. In both of those genres it does its job well enough, but the emotion and philosophy aren't nearly as memorable as the movie's first half."
" Disappointed
",2019-09-20 00:00:00,5,"What I like:
I like the main actor, and the first few minutes looks very promising, with an unexpected mix of science fiction.
The scene in Belgium was very nice too (the love affair with the Pakistan guy)
I also liked the critics against religion all all its nonsense.What I don't like:
The main actor is just overacting, with his wide open eyes. it may looks funny for a few minutes, but then it looks dumb for the whole movie.
I tried to like the movie, but I couldn't. It is supposed to be funny, but every joke falls flat on the ground, they are for 8 years old kids.Overall:
There were a few good ideas in this movie, like communicating without words, just holding hands, and criticizing the religion nonsense; but the movie direction looks like a joke, and not a funny one."
" Just because of Christmas treat...

It's senseless movie... though I'm not talking about concept... I'm talking about the way the film process... really i want to crawl outside the theatre..regretting every bit of decision... the movie sucks its entire run time... even a guest appearance won't make me to increase its rating from 1/10"
" Wow !

" the new york times review
",2019-05-28 00:00:00,9,"No religions were harmed in the making of this film. That's the gist of a title card that runs before the credits in the Hindi movie ""PK,"" directed by Rajkumar Hirani, which states that the film doesn't intend to hurt the feelings of any community, sect or religion.And this sweet, ambling comedy about an innocent abroad - an alien who touches down in the Rajasthan desert - doesn't offend, even as it pokes gentle fun at religious differences and hypocrisy.When PK (Aamir Khan) lands in Rajasthan, naked and gym-buff, his first encounter with an earthling is a rude one. A man steals his flashing green pendant (it matches his flashing green eyes), a remote control that allows him to call his ship for pickup.After some twists and turns - including a quick, PK-less detour to Belgium for a Pakistani Romeo and Indian Juliet love story - our hero acquires language (Hindi) and finds himself in Delhi in search of his pendant. God alone, he's told, can help him.Guileless, he appeals to God in all his houses: temples, mosques, churches. Sneaking into a maternity ward, he examines an infant from top to bare bottom, looking for a label: is he Christian, Muslim, Hindu?Mr. Hirani's other films include ""Lage Raho Munna Bhai"" (2006), a comedy about a gangster who becomes a Gandhi-inspired good guy. That movie and its slogan, ""Gandhigiri,"" were so successful that they ushered in a small real-life wave of Gandhian protests.It's hard to imagine that ""PK,"" with its slogan ""wrong number"" (when God's interlocutors get their wires crossed), will have a similar impact. Mr. Hirani remains an excellent storyteller, weaving his disparate story strands into a convincing, satisfying whole - a rare Bollywood feat.But ""PK"" lacks the redemptive arc of ""Lage Raho"" - at least its hero does. PK, played with earnest sexlessness by Mr. Khan, who possesses one of Hindi cinema's most ogled bodies, is another man-boy innocent meant to remind us of our own corruption. He does, but so benignly, that it's hard to feel the sting."
" Benchmark in the history of Cinema
",2019-05-26 00:00:00,10,"A film like PK can never be made again in Hindi Film Industry because of it's vast variety of content and emotions which directly grips the audience along with the characters. With PK being made, the scale of good cinema has risen further. Raju Hirani has proved that a movie with a strong content can be made with fun and comedy as well. All the characters have their own importance and every incident feels real as one can easily connect with the moments happening in the film. Direction and scripting is so good that you can not point out what mistakes are there."
" OH MY GOD PART 2

" Drag too long
",2019-04-07 00:00:00,7,"A Khan is my beloved actor. Like a tyhoon, he is sweeping Hong kong a few years ago with his sincerity, modesty and humbleness, being a super star. Most of his films are enchanting, with new genre every time, deeply researched plot, and theme to improve his society. He is nicknamed India Andy Lau Tak Wah. But to me, he goes much further than Andy Lau.This present movie, however, is unnecessarily long. In spite of this, the plot is innvovated and funny, a bit like The man who comes from star, a kdrama. But this is not a love story.Overall speaking, a meaningful plot yet to be shortened. Still a work worth seeing."
" Spoiled hindu religious
",2019-03-26 00:00:00,1,PK is containing such wording which is not good and bad about hindu religious. Overall comedy is fine but playing with religious is really not good. I don't know how anushka accepted this script. Well this is my last movie to be watched for aamir in theater. My rating is based upon destroying hindu religion.
" Atheism

" The Film guides people to think logically while leading their lives
",2019-02-25 00:00:00,9,"PK is an exceptional movie. It carries a message, asking all us all to take care of humanity rather than just religion. It provokes your thoughts and makes you think about how the world works. The movie throws light on the fact that we are so biased about people from other religions, that we often mistake the good for the bad. The Film also guides people not to be superstitious. The movie is not an attack on any Religion, it is an attack on Mankind as it exists today. It highlights the wrongdoings by the so called godmen and makes an attempt to showcase them to the world. The points raised were good but could have hurt sentiments of some groups of people. Though there are some unpredictable scenes which make the audience uncomfortable. I won't recommend anyone to watch it with young children as some scene might affect them negatively. Overall it has a really good plot and fine performances from the star cast."

" Pathetic excuse for movie
",2018-09-24 00:00:00,2,"I avoided all the hype surrounding this movie, and instead waited until it was on Netflix, four years after its release. I am glad I didn't spend my hard earned money on this piece of trash.There is a song from the 1959 movie ""Dhool ka Phool"", which goes as ""Tu Hindu Banega Na Musalman Banega, Insaan Ki Aulaad Hai Insaan Banega"", the gist of which is ""One is just a human being irrespective of his/her religious upbringing"". The movie takes this idea and stretches into a 2.5 hour worth of torture.The movie borrows its opening from ""The Terminator"", where an alien is sent to earth and hence, is completely naked. The rest of the movie is just the message ""All religions are absurd, all humans are same"" hammered again and again, until one looks forward for the movie to end.On his planet, the alien can communicate with fellow planet-people just by touching each other. Yet, this alien has the ability of vision, speech and hear sounds. We will let the evolutionary biologists discuss the intricacies of such evolutionary abnormality.The movie uses all the tired cliches to drive its pointForeign locales - check
Boy-girl romance - check
Indo-Pak relationship - check

Dysfunctional father - daughter relationship - checkSome of the events in movie take place in Bruges. I still don't understand what Bruges had to do with entire movie. Those events could have happened in Bombay or Karachi and could have still been relevant.Bollywood is not very well-known for being subtle in its movies, and this movie is no exception. In every scene, we are reminded about the inconsistency between the religious beliefs and religion being of no relevance to daily living.Acting wise - every major actor seems to think that one has to over act-over emote to be known as good actor. Nothing is normal - everything is over-the-top in the movie. Aamier wears a permanent exclamation on his face - yes Aaamir, we get it - you cannot understand the way people function on the planet. But I thought that after spending few weeks in Delhi, you might get used to the absurdity of life - at least an intelligent person would.Anyway, the movie appealed to masses and has raked in millions. So at this point, finding faults with this movie is moot. But if you still haven't watched movie, do yourself a favour, and instead spend time with your loved ones, pursue a hobby or just enjoy the life. You will be much happier."
" Seen them all on YouTube!
",2018-09-20 00:00:00,10,"This ended up being the highest grossing movie in India! Well, it was at least until three or four movies came that made even more money. It's annoying how that record keeps changing. Anyway, this movie tells the story of an alien who comes to Earth and is confused by religion. The movie says that the message is that there is a God who created us. There's another God that we create that we use for our own selfish needs.It's a rather unique and poignant message. The funniest bit is probably when he's chasing the guy dressed as Shiva. I guess India can be critical of religion too. A lot of this movie was told in flashback just like ""3 Idiots"". I hear they're made by the same director so that figures. It took me awhile to understand the title.He's called Tipsy which translates to PK in Hindi. The joke is that everyone thinks he's drunk. I regret to inform everyone that my depression while watching movies hasn't gotten better. Then again, as I've seen and reviewed every movie I can find on YouTube, I'd probably stop watching movies every day anyway. I'll still review movies in theaters and episodes of TV shows. I'll eventually go back to movie a day reviews, but for now, I'm just hoping my feelings go away. ****"
" Thanks for this film
",2018-09-17 00:00:00,10,"I'm masoud i live in iran and talk with wrong number.
My life is like PK.
Thank you from the author of the movie.

" ""Looks like the phone lines to God have gone kaput...""
",2018-07-30 00:00:00,8,"Unless I'm mistaken, I don't believe the name 'PK' was ever mentioned throughout the movie. By contrast, 'Tipsy' came up more than a dozen times but is not mentioned as Aamir Khan's nickname in the credits list. It became pretty obvious to me that the character of PK/Tipsy was modeled after 'Mork from Ork', whether intentional or not. At one point, I thought Tipsy would use a chair to stand on his head the way Robin Williams did when he auditioned for 'Mork and Mindy'. I liked the concept the movie had to offer. PK/Tipsy's beat down of phony religious practitioners was both irreverent and to the point, and one wonders how hucksters can fool so many people all of the time. There were some clever takes on the way PK came to understand life on Earth, as in his concept of money and dancing cars; the six hour language transfer by holding hands was a tenuous idea but Khan made it work. The thing that distracted me a lot about Khan's performance was that wild bug-eyed appearance he had. It made him look like maybe he was crazy, though for someone challenging the authority of the Tapasvi Maharaj (Saurabh Shukla), maybe that was precisely the point.Actress Anushka Sharma was quite refreshing as Jagat 'Jannu' Janani. Her eventual reconciliation with Sarfraz Yousuf (Sushant Singh Rajput) was well played out, though I did have a problem with the idea that they never tried to contact each other after the misunderstanding at the church. As is often the case with Hindi films, rather lengthy segments are given over to song and dance sequences, with the 'Lusty Lad' and 'Love is a Waste of Time' numbers being particularly vibrant and colorful. What gets me is the number of costume changes the principal characters undergo during the very same segment, something you never see in non-Indian productions. So that remains indigenous to Hindi films. All in all, an entertaining movie that unlike many coming out of India, doesn't seem quite as long as it's two and a half hour run time. You can probably chalk that up to the quirky story telling and likeable principal characters. For Aamir Khan, a bit of an offbeat role from other films I've seen him in, which only goes to demonstrate his versatility as an actor."
" A MUST WATCH FOR EVERY GENERATION
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,8,This is a movie must watch for every generation. this is the perfect example of how you can effectively tell something but so simply! Obviously outstanding performance by Amir Khan. the second half becomes serious than first half but it doesn't lose your grip to the script. Very well made and the message received is received well.....
" Best one ever.
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,10,Its a great movie. I watch it on New year and it was a blockbuster watch. Too good acting and a terrific storyline. Well done Aamir khan.
" Pleasant surprise
",2018-07-19 00:00:00,10,"292/5000
This movie was on my list awhile, I can not remember the reason. The first few minutes were okay, but as the movie went by, it was wrapping me up to leave me in ecstasy. It's about fiction, romance, religion, nonsense and innocence, everything I love most in a single movie. It's one of my top 10."
" The movie is brilliant ...
",2018-05-25 00:00:00,10,"You'll laugh your hearts out, you'll cry, you'll leave the theater inspired, and with a sense of joy, that only a Rajkumar Hirani film can give to you. Aamir was the heart and soul of the movie. You can't take your eyes off of him. Anushka Sharma was brilliant too. She has evolved as an actor over the years, and it clearly reflects in her role."
" a great movie
",2018-05-05 00:00:00,10,"I am not used to watch Hindi movies , 
but this is one movie that i must put review .
i ma a Srilankan. India and our country shares same cultural and social behaviors.
this movie highlights significant social problems in thees society .
at the end film ends with most powerful secret in history ,
where is the true god ?"
" Doses of comedy and message in right balance
",2018-04-23 00:00:00,9,This is my best movie of all times. This has the blend of entertainment and sound storyline in the right order and logical connection. Aamir's brilliance along with beautiful story made my day. Moreover this is a deep satire over the ongoing condition in the country and at the same times solutions are also offered. Simplicity wins hearts and this movie achieved it.
" HANDS DOWN--A GEM.
",2018-03-13 00:00:00,10,"One night I went out--sad and depressed. When I get this way, often I just want to take my mind off of home life, and a film might just be the cure. At this point I had never heard of Aamir Khan nor was I up to date on who's who in the zoo in Bollywood, (even though I had seen Slumdog Millionaire--what a film) nor had I had any intention of seeing a foreign film-- let alone a foreign film called PK. I asked myself, ""what is this?"" So, I read the description of the film, and a description never gives away much of the film, but I said I have to see this one, I don't understand what its about nor is it in my language, but I have to see it--perfect, this is the film I want to see--lets take a chance tonight. I really didn't want to go see mainstream film (that would be the first thing in theaters that's playing)--how boring. So, I decided to go see this film. I believe that night I was the only non-Indian present inside the theater. Let me tell you, I was meant to be there that night. It was a divine appointment. It was as if GOD Himself said to me, ""I love you--it's going to be alright"". The more I watched, the more I laughed and cried. It was all in subtitles, but this film was a BIG BLESSING for my life that night, and continues to be. This film became very personal for me. Everything that was discussed, everything that was addressed, I just felt in my heart to be true. BIG important questions asked in this film. I was out of my comfort zone, and I was loving every second of it. To the crew that thought, wrote, and made this film--I applaud you. Thank you for being a part of my life that night, and thank you for allowing me to be a part of yours. This is a very elemental, yet extremely profound film. BRAVO."
" You gona lpve this movie
",2018-02-12 00:00:00,10,Best Indian movie ever made.This movie helps you to understand howes the relegins work.and i think its wonderfull.
" PK is unbelievable
",2018-01-08 00:00:00,10,"PK is unbelievably funny. It has a great story line, but besides that it has a fantastic cast to go with it."
" Imazing
",2018-01-08 00:00:00,10,"Imazing Movie From India!!!!!!!
For first time i like a movie in bollywood!!!!"
" The Pure Love
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,9,PK is a story of pure love for me. When I first started the movie I was very confused because I was wondering how can a story with an alien turn into to something meaningful and excited. But turns out that PK fascinated me. It's one of my favourite movies of all time. It showed me how weird is it like to be a human. It showed me how we put borders to ourself and live like robots. It showed me how to sacrifice and what true love is. This movie is magical. Everyone should watch it. Don't leave it at the half! You'll get it in second half if don't understand at first.
" Finest Indian Movie
",2017-12-29 00:00:00,8,"This is one of the few Indian movies I admit have taken my entire attention and admiration. Unlike many Indian movies, this doesn't portray the Indian culture in any way, because it's addressed internationally, so there is no Indian factor in here. On the other hand, it deals with a few important subjects all at once, without forgetting the romance ! The concept was really good I really liked it, and it is humorous, in nondislikeable way.
 
8/10 Probably we won't see such Indian movie in the far future."
" Great movie.
",2017-12-18 00:00:00,8,"I am not a huge fan of Indian films but this one was a lot of fun. An alien lands on earth and loses his communication device. He doesnt know what to do and when he asks folks for help they tell him to pray to god. So he spends the entire movie looking for god. He joins every religion and follows all their customs to talk to god but he still couldn't get his communicator back. As he was about to give up he meets a reporter who realizes he is telling the truth so she tries to help him. He has a real weird view on life on earth so she uses that to push a story about the alien who was challenging the religious leaders because he felt that their connection to god was hijacked by a prankster. So he tries to help the priests by exposing the pranksters illogical suggestions. Its pretty funny and pokes fun of a lot of religious practices that really are hilarious to watch though at the same time, its sad to think that anyone believes in them in the 21st century. There are a few music pieces in this and they were also fun and not very distracting from the comedy.All that said, I gave it an 8 because it is not flawless. A lot of the arguments made are actually pretty well known so there was nothing new except the funny mimes and the aliens behavior. The real issue is the plot hole that materialized towards the end. It could have been handled in a much smarter way but still, this is a comedy so it really shouldnt be taken so seriously hence my high grade.If you dont usually watch foreign subtitled movies, this is a great one to start with... you are missing a lot of great stuff if you dont."
" Funny, sincere, and fairly absurd
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,8,"A sort of adult E.T. mixed with a little romantic comedy and a lot of religion mockery, PK barrels along with broad humor, excellent acting, and an unlikely but enjoyable story.In PK, a bug-eyed, floppy-eared Aamir Khan comes to earth and has him phone-home device stolen. After a few people tell him only God can help him get home, the alien develops a transactional concept of human religion, and is continually perplexed by his difficulties in getting one of our wold's many Gods he woos to help him out. While God lets him down, a curious reporter (Anushka Sharma) recovering from heartache comes up with an odd way to help, which involves creating a media war between the alien and a religious leader.The moral of the movie is pretty much, organized religion sucks. Religion is portrayed (and I'm on the filmmaker's side here) as a film- flam that at best takes your money and at worst results in terrorism and war.There are some logic issues here. I'll admit, I'm not Indian, but I think it's at least as religious as America, and if a news station created a platform for an agnostic rabble-rouser here it would not go well for them. But as I say, I don't know much of anything about India, so perhaps they are more open to debate than my local Christians.I'm also not convinced an alien would leap to this particular set of unlikely conclusions, but then, there's no real guarantee aliens would have much intelligence outside of the technological kind.This is a very funny and occasionally touching movie with Khan weird and funny and Sharma perky and lovable. It also has some excellent songs, most notably Love is a Waste of Time, which is the first Indian song I ever found myself humming after the movie ended.If you want to see a silly, anti-(organized)religion movie, this is an excellent choice."
" starts like a spoof and ends as a melodrama
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,6,"It starts like a spoof and ends as a melodrama. Director adds unnecessary sentiments and emotions to a unreal character who happened to be the protagonist of the movie. It affects the structure as well as gives viewers an unpleasant feeling.Though PK movie contains ample social criticism, It failed to narrate the story in a reasonable way."
" IMDb deceiving: deserves an Oscar for overacting
",2017-07-14 00:00:00,3,"Sometimes a movie can be really annoying. Whether it is because of a bad story or because of even worse acting. This movie will certainly annoy people with a sense of humor becauseÂ… the only humor consists of the main character holding his eyes wide open ??!!??!! Fake voters constantly keep on re-entering this movie into the top 250. Please, IMDb rate the fake voters accordingly and kick this cheap time waster out of the top 5,000. Shame on the film makers and actors."
" Real Quality
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,10,"One of the best movies ever. There is almost everything with best quality such as drama, comedy, message and so on. This is what really deserve an Oscar. Just watch the film and you'll see. Quick tip: If you liked this movie or movie's general meaningful story line watch other movies of Amir Khan"
" PK The Movie
",2017-06-16 00:00:00,9,"This is a very good movie, Amir Khan acted very well and perfectly blow up his character. The movie is full of social messages as well as religious messages too. There are so many people around the world who are acting with very narrow religious views that is what this movie tries to show to the viewer. The scene when Amir Khan first found to the earth fully naked just hiding himself with the radio was a eyes catching moment and the pathetic moreover funny scenes are when Amir khan seeking God to get back his remote control. Really Awesome movie."
" Good Movie
",2017-06-16 00:00:00,8,"A story with multiple layers that deal with human emotions at its best. This film is exemplary of what we call unravelling the true human nature and at its best the Indian way of living. We are the ones who break laws, believe in unworthy and fraud Godmen, take each other's lives in the name of religion and in this upside down world when a person like PK enters, there is a lot to explore."
" This is amazing
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,8,This movie is superb with Amir's acting and lot of fun with his actions.One should surely see this movie to chill out their stress.... I am a big fan of Amir and in this movie he had shown amazing talent.. thank you sir doing such a great movie.. happy watching

",2017-02-25 00:00:00,10,"A humanoid alien (Aamir Khan) lands on Earth naked on a research mission in Rajasthan, but is stranded when the remote control of his spaceship is stolen. He manages to get the thief's cassette recorder, a Panasonic RQ- 565D. On the same day in Bruges, Jaggu (Anushka Sharma) meets Sarfaraz (Sushant Singh Rajput) and falls in love with him. Jaggu's father (Parikshit Sahni) objects to their relationship because Sarfaraz is a Pakistani Muslim, while Jaggu is a Hindu. He consults godman Tapasvi Maharaj (Saurabh Shukla) who predicts that Sarfaraz will betray Jaggu. Determined to prove them wrong, Jaggu proposes to Sarfaraz, who accepts. She is heartbroken at the wedding chapel when she receives a letter calling off the marriage due to their cultural differences.Jaggu returns to India and becomes a TV reporter. She meets the alien and is intrigued to see him distribute leaflets about the ""missing"" Gods. She saves him when he attempts to take money from a collection box, earning his trust.The alien tells her that he is a research scientist from another planet. His people know nothing about dressing, religion or verbal communication. They transfer ideas by holding hands. The alien learned to fit in among humans by wearing clothes and using money stolen from couples having sex in ""dancing cars"".After being accidentally hit by a truck, the alien is befriended by bandmaster Bhairon Singh (Sanjay Dutt), who takes him along with his troop. The alien attempts to learn to communicate by grabbing peoples' hands but people chase him away, believing him to be a pervert. Bhairon takes him to a brothel, where the alien holds a prostitute's (Reema Debnath) hand for six hours and thus learns the Bhojpuri language.Bhairon has a conversation with the alien, and suggests that the thief may be in Delhi. The alien leaves for Delhi. Due to his strange behavior, the people assume he is drunk and call him ""PK"" (pee-kay, Hindi for ""drunk""). People tell him that only ""God"" can help him find his remote. PK sincerely practices every Indian religion attempting to find ""God"", to no avail. He later discovers that Tapasvi has his remote, who claims it was a gift from God, and refuses to return the remote. Jaggu promises PK that she will recover his remote and he can go back home.PK conjectures that Tapasvi and other godmen must be dialling a ""wrong number"" to communicate with God, and are therefore advising the public to engage in meaningless rituals. Jaggu encourages the public to expose fraudulent godmen, by sending their videos to her news channel. This ""wrong number"" campaign turns into a popular mass-movement, to the dismay of Tapasvi. Meanwhile, Bhairon finds the thief and contacts PK, telling him that he sold his remote control to Tapasvi, after which PK realises that Tapasvi was actually a fraud all along and that it wasn't a ""wrong number"". Bhairon then informs him that they will come to Delhi, but both die in a terrorist attack. The terrorist attack is later declared by Tapasvi's group to be stated as protecting their Gods."
