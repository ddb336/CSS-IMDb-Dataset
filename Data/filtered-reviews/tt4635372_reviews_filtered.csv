Gr8 work by Director and hoping new recipe will come soon!!"
" Fantastic
",2021-03-17 00:00:00,9,"One of the very few Bollywood movies that are world class - bereft of the cliched dancing, drama, good vs bad tropes, with stellar performances by Chadha, Mishra and Kaushal. The story plots twist in a way that you never see coming, and happily, there are no real happy endings. Excellent work up there with Dhobi Ghat (although much better)."

Vickey kaushal, Sweta tripathy, Richa Chadda weaves the main seeds of this storyline here. Sanjay Mishra, Pankaj Tripathi added more taste to this uneven storyline. Masaan not only for ending, it also gives the permission of new life.and this permission is bounded for all ."
" Amazing....
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,8,Beautiful story with brilliant cast outshine the movie. The movie plot holds you tight and it keeps getting gripping through out the story. Brilliant acting done by all the characters and supporting cast. Great to watch üëç
" One word: excellence
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,8,One of the best films the Indian film industry has offered so far.
" Best ART
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,9,Masaan is the masterpiece. Every scene is perfect in movie. Hats off to creators who created these art. Movie starts with two totally diferent story of devi and deepak. Specially the story of devi is very inspiring she shows how she can be self- dependent no matter what situation she is in or what gender she have and she can do it because she speaks honestly. Also special mention to sanjay Mishra we all know he is legend really his performance is brilliant in movie. The only thing with story is its little slow but it's also important for charecters and worth of watching.
" Awesome movie, good story, dares to talk about caste system and Discrimination
",2020-07-23 00:00:00,10,"I liked the story line, direction of the movie. The actors are very good. The best thing about this movie is that it is amongst the very few bollywood movie which dares to talk about the issue of caste system and Discrimination present in the society."
" This movie is about hope
",2020-07-10 00:00:00,10,"Neeraj Ghaywan + Varun Grover = üëåüèΩ
Every single frame was beautiful"
" Best movie I have ever seen.
",2020-06-29 00:00:00,8,"At once a both smart and powerful film, Neeraj Ghaywan's ""Masaan"" is a very fine film for our generation. A youthfully entertaining drama about love and curiosity, this is a film which shall be remembered not for how it rattles our tranquility, but for how it shakes the core of your heart. And that's the best compliment I can afford for an Indian film in recent times. It's the best Hindi film of the year- and easily the most compelling one. Don't miss it."
" No Crap,Pure Emotion:Art at its best
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,10,"Experience the emotions of characters in this..
Movies like these are very rare.
Say no to Crap."
" If you're not privileged enough, Struggle is your Fate
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,7,"The film depicts the life of two young people with two different set of stories both having lower economic conditions i.e. poor yet aspiring. Not much revealing about the story & plot other than stated in the premise section, as it has to be experienced by ourselves. Story offer something different to it viewers which we never encounter normally. Drama leads to the high on emotions including Love, Care, Hate, Grief and imitated strongly by the leads.
Sanjay Mishra as poor, concerned yet caring father was very realistic and he was as good as he always is. Richa Chadda & Vicky Kaushal were natural and nailed their characters as it was required. Despite having much lesser dialogues both the characters required subtlety & high emotions to engage its audience and both of them did a commendable job."
" Don't Miss this Gem
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,10,Watched a bollywood movie after a long time and i must say i am regretting why I haven't watched it earlier. This is the real indian cinema. We need more movies like this one instead of those multistarrer  movies. This movie is a must watch
" The strange causes of death and the life after.
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,8,Powerful film with master writing. Two simple stories running with the same pace on either banks of ganga river and shows the social stigmas present in both upper castes and lower castes. All the actors did justice to their characters. Unique music very different from the movies of mainstream.
" Good one
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,7,"Shown the real picture of Indian suburbs where the details of the cremation near the Ganges feels a new way of setting description. Two central characters, plot around their lives, their problems, their struggling feel like real and has a common approach. Nicely written, directed and shot."
" Need of improvement
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,8,"The movie that shows how much improvement we need in our remote areas. How citizens are not aware of their fundamental right and how they can be tricked into the name of law. The pain in the movie is portrayed well with stunning realistic acting and cinematography. Climax was good. A message recieved.
We live in a great country but the sad reality is we fear society's opinion. Only we can bring change.
A must watch movie for enlightenment towards your country."
" Need of improvement
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,8,"The story that tells us how indians are not aware of their rights against law. How easy it is to trap them in the name of law, the fear of police and society. The enigma is well presented in the movie with realistic capture and acting. What is paim, how a human deal with pressure and painand how well we know what really matters."

" Finally a great hindi movie
",2019-11-08 00:00:00,9,"Masaan a very untypical Bollywood movie, with great cinematography, and amazing acting is a must watch for movie lovers.Small town culture is realistically captured. The writer i believe is also stand up comedian varun grover, has crafted a serious story well.As a young girl, shweta tripathi stands out, even though she's not in the front cast list of this movie.Unfortunately this movie didn't get enough publicity in media, and i totally missed it in 2015, but this hidden gem will surface through internet and will be seen by many."

" A raw picture of India
",2019-09-13 00:00:00,10,"The story of this movie fully reflected the real, the raw picture of Indian society. Our Indian society seems like it has developed a lot. We think our mentality has changed positively. But there are also many small towns where corruption and cast-ism is very much prominent than we think. Thanks to the team Masaan who did this amazing masterpiece of art. This movie will be an inspiration to the millions of film makers in the generations to come."

",2019-03-14 00:00:00,10,Movie is absolutely brilliant. Richa Chadda and Vicky kaushal characters are very unique and they have done superb acting. Richa has always been my favourite since the time i saw gangs of wasseypur. People just watch this movie.

",2018-11-08 00:00:00,10,Speechless.Hays off:}...ytidjhsjjshjwgjfsg.M ovies like these are less made in india wow superb
" Thought provoking Cinema, at it's very best!
",2018-11-05 00:00:00,10,"Masaan means crematorium. This movie is centred around the banks of river ganga where funerals are conducted. The story takes 2 tracks, one is richa chadda's track - an educated smart girl, trapped in a society that doesn't want to match her pace, instead wants to just pull her down by trying to shove sexist prejudices down her throat. The second track is around Vicky Kaushal - a boy whose ancestral tree has been in the funeral work, but he is smart and completing a good education, falls head over heels in love, young, innocent college love and then loses that love in the most shattering way. Both tracks take us through a series of emotions that the main characters experience. First love, desire.. then regret, pain .. then longing for closure.. all around the banks of Ganga where the ultimate closure is done. I might run out of words to describe this film. It has so many layers. It is so very moving and thought inducing. It is just brilliant in all possible departments - acting, writing, film setting, screenplay. Just superb. If there is a list of 100 movies one must-watch in a lifetime, Masaan will be in that list."
" Reality Check
",2018-11-03 00:00:00,8,"This movie is totally filled with realistic characters whom we witness in small towns and consists of various shades of emotions, daily struggles and challenges that lower middle class groups encounter. It beautifully depicts the lives of people in the backdrop of the ghats of Varanasi."
" A timeless piece of art
",2018-09-28 00:00:00,9,"Have you ever thought what makes a film to have a long lasting impression on its audience. It doesn't always require an unique storyline or plot, nor does it always need a big setup, sometimes simplicity does the trick. Masaan is a proof of that kind, it is as simple as it can get, got into the heart of its viewers, only to remain there forever.
A well researched movie by Neeraj Ghaywan, about varanasi, the accent, the people. But sometimes we have also seen that too much research spoils the movie. The problem here is that the director needs to also decide what part of the research to show in the movie. A prime example is Batti Gul Meter Chalu. Here the director along with the location and the prevalent local attires also tried to completely use the local language. Most of the audience never heard that language and above that even the actor seemed to be speaking the language only superficially as the language was also new to them. 
The movie covers two parallel story set up in Varanasi, a father-daughter duo and a love story of a lower caste boy and an upper caste girl. Both the stories has tragedy as their central theme and the story leads the characters to cross each other in the climax. Director, Neeraj kept the ending quite open ended and allowed the audiences to have their own opinion about the life of the characters after the movie has ended. Sometimes this kind of open ended climax works in the negative way where the audience wants to know about the final fate of the characters because they want the writers to give them a happy ending. The director and writer Varun Grover in this movie never aimed to actually tell stories of four lives, rather they just want their audiences to feel and experience their pain. Trust me they did it brilliantly. The love story between Vicky kausal and Shweta Tripathy was not only heartwarming but also looked very authentic. The best part is that the writers never used any catchy bollywood liners in the movie to express their romance. The cinematographer Avinash Arun very beautifully captured the nuances of Varanasi as a background to this love story. This also made the love story look more realistic. Notably the scene in which Vicky and Shweta met for the first time, scenes of durga puja fair, first date at restaurant are the ones which leaves you wanting more. 
The movie could have never been so good without the good performances of its lead actors especially Vicky Kausal. Director Neeraj has dug gold here with Vicky. Even when Vicky Kausal has featured in two feature films before Masaan, he for the first time has done a noteworthy role and you will keep thanking the director for this. You will rejoice with him when he is happy and will cry when he cries. Such was the effect of his act and character in the movie. Shweta Tripathy is sweet and innocent and played her character from the heart. Pankaj Tripathi shines in his short role. The casting of Richa Chaddha for the role of Devi Pathak played out to be perfect as it now seems that role of strong and bold female character is always made for Richa. She has previously played the role of a bold girl with outward personality in Oye Lucky Lucky Oye, so this was not the first time for Richa. The song ""tu kis rail si guzarti hain"" is very well written and the music by Indian Ocean has quite a bit of local flavor. This song during durga puja festival very beautifully connects the audience with the unspoken romance between Vicky and Shweta. 
While the movie does complete justice with the story of Vicky and Shaalu, it couldn't do justice at the same level with the story of father and daughter. Not that the director failed to show the estranged relationship between Richa as daughter and Sanjay Mishra as father, they actually did able to keep the audience hooked to this story as well but the audience will not feel the same connection what they will feel with the story of Vicky and Shaalu. The missing thread here is that the writers and directors didn't tell the audience about how was the characters life before the tragedy happened. They started the movie with the tragedy itself in case of sanjay-Richa story while in case of other story they first showed how happy the characters were before the tragedy. Overall one should watch this, as not everytime you come across such a marvelous piece of art."
" Simply superb
",2018-09-11 00:00:00,9,"One of the best Indian movies I've seen in a long time a breath of fresh air from the usual big budget nonsense out these days have seen it over 3 times, quite a sad and tragic story but keeps the viewer hooked with a silver lining at the end it's a must watch"
" Everything happens for a reason
",2018-09-07 00:00:00,9,"This movie is a masterpiece, such a gripping story line and beautiful execution. It's not a regular love story, something different and mature. Love in many ways, Love is blind, you can't ask caste and economic status to define it. The actors did an amazing job by giving their best in every shot.
Music is the soul of this movie, Indian Ocean gave their best, whether it is Mann Kasturi or Tu Kisi Rail Si Guzarti Hai. The lyrics of the songs are beautifully written.
The ballon scene is something new and a nice representation of expressing love without showing it. Sending facebook request just like an ordinary guy is the thing we can relate to. 
This movie is simple yet complicated."
" What a waste of time
",2018-09-01 00:00:00,2,One of the slowest movies with no conclusion. What was the intent behind creating this movie?
" An all too real movie.
",2018-07-09 00:00:00,9,"The beauty of this movie is that it is a tragedy and it is all too real. I read reviews from some of the western viewers who found the concept of police taking money unrealistic. Welcome to India where a girl having sex before marriage is considered worse than crime. Things are changing in India but they haven't all changed so it is real. There are some powerful performances from Richa Chadha (Devi), Sanjay Mishra (Devi's father), Vicky Kaushal (Deepak) and above all Shweta Tripathi (Shalu). I am going to start with Shalu. She is a college girl who loves poetry (Shayari) and falls for this boy who she doesn't know very well. She enjoys his physical touch and his company and that is portrayed so well by her. You could see her as that innocent girl next door. She only has a relatively small role in the movie but she does shine.Deepak is young boy who is from a poor family and he is about to complete his bachelors in civil engineering. He has a bright future in front of him but he does carry his family background as a baggage on his shoulders. He falls in love and deeply cares about this girl but he is not sure if he can get her even though she loves him dearly. He does lose her and he portrays the grief astoundingly. You feel bad when he is crying and that is hallmark of good acting. Vicky has that effortless way of selling his character.Devi is another character who you feel really bad about. She falls in love with a boy and decides to make love to her. This act is caught by police and the boy commits suicide and she is told that she has committed a crime. She is not so sure that she has done anything wrong but the society including her father thinks otherwise. She feels trapped and wants to break free but this is not easy in this male dominated society. You root for her and movie stops at the right juncture.Last character I was touched by was Mr. Pathak who is Devi's father. He is exploited by local authorities who are threatening to ruin his daughter. He knows that his daughter hasn't committed any crime but he finds himself too weak to really stand up for her. Instead he tries to cover for her the best he can. He loves his daughter but finds himself somewhat powerless and meekly gets exploited. Sanjay Mishra portrays the helplessness so well.Supporting characters besides the above four were also real. I watched this movie because its writer is Varun Grover who I have started to admire after watching some of his stand up routines. I do see this movie and say to myself that Hindi movies do indeed have a future. There is life beyond multi crore Khan movies. I highly recommend this movie if you don't mind a tragedy. It is not going to be a song and dance routine but is a real depiction of life in many circles."
" Even if disaster striked, life had a way out!
",2018-05-31 00:00:00,9,"Tone, Script & Story: Masaan stands for crematorium. The movie moves around two stories, both belonging to people and their lives who live along the ghat of Ganges. The story puts light on many factors. How acting out of curiousity may be wrong. What it takes to save the innocent. The caste factor. Secretly loving someone under shadow of caste difference. How one's father slowly loses his morals. What one learns from things happening around them and the list goes on.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Top degree of execution by the counterparts in mentioned area. Music: Music is average. Acting: Justified performances from all the leads.Final Verdict: What I liked was that the movie escalates on idea that, even if disaster strikes, life has a way out."
" This is not just a movie
",2017-09-29 00:00:00,9,This is not just a movie .It is some stories. Stories of life . Life that normal people like us leads with some dreams. Dreams get broken. Hearts get broken but life goes on. we all forget what happened to us with time. People goes away.Things go away.But the pain stays.Stays forever.This is a movie which will force you to remember those pains. May be for a moment but it will bring back your memories.Trust me it will.
" Lost interest after the opening scene title
",2017-09-14 00:00:00,2,"First of all I am a film enthusiast. I love foreign thoughtfully crafted films as much as the next, but the problem with Masaan and plenty of foreign films of late Is that they get very praised, full stars, win much prises but its nothing special about them at all. And I just can't see why? Of course I haven't seen them all but The Salesman, leviathan, separation and the other Heavy hitters has left me with only feeling what a waste of hours spent. Its actually just kitchen sink dramas that really doesn't lead anywhere. i find them very boring and they all tend to play on some family tragedy and it gets very repetitive. In the wrong way also, I just cant relate to these characters. In the opening in this Movie a grad student wants to take suicide when the cops come bustig him for sex. Thats just profoundly stupid. sure, embarrassing for the kid but you brush it off. ANd it gets worse, then the female character doesn't say anything? its all your fault and press charges on the pigs for cops. In the salemsan we have this very stupid dialogue between the theater sessions. Its like who in the right mind act like that in reality? his wife was almost beaten to Death and he act like a swine throughout the entire Movie. The protagonist main characters just comes out as stereotypical. very stereotypical. Its often a poor family. and a father figure that in the end shoot down the baddies or just completely fall apart. thats it."
" One of the best Bollywood movies.
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,9,"This was one of the best movies I saw in my life. The story revolves around two characters. The story mainly shows the problems in Indian society. This movie can be ugly to the people who like to watch the glamorous Bollywood movies, live in a bubble and close their eyes to the reality. The movie is a reflection of Indian society. Altogether it was a great movie."
" Unusual Bollywood Movie
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,7,"I have to start this comment by admitting that I'm not an expert on Bollywood movies, but I've always enjoyed Bollywood and it's specific culture. Unlike many of other Indian products in movie sector, Masaan contains drama and it does not try to make it seem better than it is. The places where events happen were not subjected to other Bollywood movies. This movie won't make you feel happy, cheerful, or will not try to convince you that everything will be alright in the end. It will just show you a section of life in India's low classes. It criticizes the common bribery in constabulary of India, also challenges the society's hypocrisy about morals. It gives some hints about the ongoing cast system in India. At the final scene, we see that all these events happened around (and in) Gannes River, which is considered as holy and sacred by Indians. Some coincidences in the movie (such as Shaluu's ring that Jhonta found in Gannes, or the meeting of Devi and Deepak) are not disturbing the audience's perception of reality. Very irrelevant but interesting fact about this movie: Richa Chadda (Devi) resembles Turkish actress Nehir Erdoƒüan in this movie."
