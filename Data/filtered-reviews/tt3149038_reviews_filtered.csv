" Well, I cried...
",2021-04-11 00:00:00,8,"...lots of tears, which I usually don't.I love Sally Hawkins in most movies -- Maudie, Happy Go Lucky -- so I was likely to enjoy this one too.The story is a little sappy, and none too believable. But the characters are appealing, and I have an affection for UK stories.I think it's hard to actively dislike this movie."
" Eh
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,6,It I feel like I wasted 2 hours for literally nothing I wish that I watched something else
" Why i love it
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,9,"Its about, kinda young and stupid but in a smart way and its about emotions every single second of it."
" A good try
",2020-11-24 00:00:00,7,"It made me cringe to some scenes, I was rolling at my bed whenever cringy stuff were happening.Overall, it's a good film for its category, but up until there. And like some other dude said at his review, indeed, you will probably forget you watched it the next day."
" Straight to the heart!
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,10,"Often, the mind takes over the matters of the heart because we are too fragile to handle them. This movie is a little jewel; brilliantly acted with a plot which involves several characters, each one with their own trials and fears to face. An emotional journey in the labyrinth of our minds!"
" Beautiful
",2020-08-25 00:00:00,10,"Great movie.The story of this movie is amazing.
And this movie have a pretty cool ending."
" Director cheated audience.
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,2,"How can the movie say it is based on true events when in reality, his father is alive and his mentor is actually a woman. Director has seriously misled the audience. I would never expect a Hollywood movie director to be such a con."
" Being on the spectrum isn't easy
",2020-08-17 00:00:00,9,"The English film X+Y (2014) was shown in the U.S. with the title A Brilliant Young Mind. Morgan Matthews directed the movie.Director Matthews chose brilliant actors, who portray their roles well. Asa Butterfield is excellent in his difficult role of Nathan Ellis, a young man on the spectrum and also suffering from PTSD. Rafe Spall is equally excellent as his math tutor. Sally Hawkins is superb as Julie Ellis, who does her best for her son, but is barely hanging on. The story is inspired by true events, but I don't know how much of it truly happened, and how much is included for dramatic effect. It certainly has the ring of truth about it.Nathan is a mathematical genius. The plot revolves around his preparation for the International Mathematics Olympiad. Everyone who competes is a mathematical genius. Some are on the spectrum, some are not. They are competing with each other for a chance to compete against student mathematicians from other countries. It's designed to be a cutthroat situation, and that's what it is.Fair warning--unless you're a mathematician yourself, the complexity of the problems that the students are solving is such that you won't get past the first question. Mathematics at this level is a different language, and only a few are able to comprehend it.This movie worked well on the small screen. It has a lukewarm IMDb rating of 7.1, but I thought it was much better than that, and rated it 9."
" Doesn't add up
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,1,"Maybe it's a case of incompatible dimensions? The linear plot and the two-dimensional characters simply can't be combined to create a coherent whole.It's unbelievable that Nathan is suddenly ""brought out of his shell"" by the attention lavished on him by Zhang Mei. It's almost as if he were simply shy and not on the autistic spectrum. And Richard (Eddie Marsan's character) seemed a very strange choice to ""manage"" the students: he was so culturally insensitive and seemed more like a former student, someone severely lacking in people skills.Watch Gregory's Girl (1980), instead."
" An enjoyable attempt to demystify some of the myths surrounding Asperger's
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,7,"An engaging, if maybe just a bit too predictable tale of a young, inept, maths prodigy ""Nathan"" (Asa Butterfield) whose is being brought up by his single-parent mother after his father was killed in an accident. His almost OCD life-style is challenged by his rather unorthodox teacher Rafe Spall who sees more in the young man so sets about getting him to try to get onto the UK Mathematics Olympiad Squad. They travel to Taiwan, then back to Cambridge as ""Nathan"" begins to come out of his cocoon a little, makes new friends - even steals a kiss from quite a pushy young girl, it has to be said! It starts off quite interestingly, but does rather descend into a bit of a teen coming-of-age drama and the last half hour is pretty formulaic; but there is a chemistry between Butterfield and Spall and Sally Hawkins shows glimmers of how hard it must be for a parent who never quite manages to relax, let alone have any kind of life of her own as his tireless mum. Certainly worth a watch."
" X+Y (A Brilliant Young Mind) - Tells its Special Story With Great Care
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,8,"This fine British film is a fictional/fact movie version of the documentary production 'Beautiful Young Minds' which was in turn about the real-life Math prodigy Daniel Lightwing. Asa Butterfield is perfect in the title role and has a strong cast of professional performers to compliment his performance. Prolific playwright James Graham's debut screenplay is exceptional in most every detail and carries the viewer through a rollercoaster ride of human emotions - as his youthful characters, etc, navigate unfamiliar human experiences.Solid direction and stylish cinematography keep it all on track, with Martin Phipps' haunting music score nicely setting the moods for each scene. Sally Hawkins gives yet another of her introspective performance as Butterfield's widowed mother - with good support from Rafe Spall (Life of Pi) as Butterfield's somewhat tortured mentor. Superior entertainment for discerning viewers, with its DVD release big on transfer quality."
" Not nearly as emotional/intense as it is played out to be
",2020-04-08 00:00:00,4,"An autistic kid who is good at math and starts to have feelings and we get to go through it. The concept is not really super intriguing. I get it but the setup doesn't really leave you having any attachment to the characters unless you know someone or are on the spectrum. I can relate only to not fitting in and awkwardness but that is in most teen/life movies.The music was beautiful but WAY to intense for what was being shown on screen. After the 5th or so scene of instense violins and cinematography, I was over it. It should have been only used in a few moments. I know some films tend to over do it but place it once or twice. Not in a film about kids doing math and liking each other.Wish there was more conflcit as it ended kind of mehIf I wanted to watch this subject, there are plenty of REAL documentaries that are quite intense and sad."
" A Brilliant young mind
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,8,Very good coming-of-age movie about being socially awkward and Incredibly good at math
" i don't see the overrating value in this film
",2020-02-06 00:00:00,5,"It was not really authentic, and i find the expression of an authistic person a little fake. i know what authism is like, and this movie is not realistic at all. there are some successful parts, like acting. asa is nearly perfect in this film. but i expected a deeper presentation of an authistic teenage. so... i did not like it."
" VIEWER +MOVIE=WORTHY WATCH
",2019-12-21 00:00:00,8,"Here is a good story and true to life regarding various kids who remain extraordinary and gifted but unrefined and forged into the wielding of their down to earth natural powers. You are reminded that as children what do we really know or understand about anything? Well add to that kids that have exceled in the ultra-remarkable areas of their gifts early-on and are discovering how they work, why, when and what, who and where. The result is the viewer is privy to watch the exceptional skills at work and left to wonder how it will all turn out for the kids, parents and associated supports. It is worthy to note that certain forms of autism perhaps all forms have immersed in them hidden mystical abilities not understood or developed by the host or their observers but considered strange to those outside of the realm they are in. At the same time if they could express themselves better they would state that others are out of the flow as their existence appears normal to them. A good reminder not to judge but to ask questions, seek patience and discover some of the mysteries inside and outside of us all. I found myself wanting this movie not to end or to have a different ending that's how good it was. It makes you want to care that much. Worthy note: Pursue what's inside you too!"
" Brilliant in many ways
",2019-12-15 00:00:00,10,"The movie takes it's time to develop the characters and makes you see them as real people with dreams, struggles & emotions.
It deals with complex subjects like being the spectrum, grief and love and it never feels forced or unnatural if anything it feels real and authentic which is something so hard to achieve.The music choice is also outstanding giving a real emotional boost to the scenes and add to that the incredible acting by all involved and you have yourself a masterfully crafted film. While it may not be for everybody if you're someone who likes good and emotional storytelling you'll certainly enjoy this."
" Afternoon Special-ish
",2019-11-03 00:00:00,7,"This movie was disappointing in several ways. First, Asa Butterfield is a fine actor, but his talent was wasted in this film, given that he barely spoke. Second, there were subplots that were thoroughly pointless, since they didn't advance the story in any way (the side story of the other autistic kid, who washes out because he's not good enough at math and the romance between Nathan's mom and his teacher). Third, and biggest, disappointment: the film can't decide whether Nathan is autistic or not. Autistic children are not miraculously cured following flashbacks to traumatic events. An autistic child who can't tolerate being touched and who's never expressed love for his mother isn't suddenly going to allow her to hug him and stroke and kiss his face, and he's certainly not going to initiate physical contact by taking her hand. I would love to see thoughtful films about autistic children, but they have to be informed as well. This one wasn't."
" Well told
",2019-07-21 00:00:00,6,A well told and well portrayed movie about an autistic math prodigy with good acting by Asa Butterfield and Sally Hawkins.
" Beautiful and deeply moving
",2019-06-19 00:00:00,9,"This is an extrodanary film exploring the evolution of a young genius. He is diagnosed as borderline autistic as as a young child.
After experiencing a gut wreching trauma and a profound loss, he withdrawals into his own world. He lives in a universe dominated by a passion for numbers and patterns. He cannot touch another person.
As he attends an international math competition, he engages in new relationships and begins to experience feelings he does not understand.
Everything about this film is exceptional and inspired. The script and direction are superb. The character development and acting are compelling and intense."
" Serious, emotionally touching movie
",2019-06-15 00:00:00,8,Made me cry. Made me feel each and every person's pain and what they lived for and cared most about. I'll never forget this movie. It really touched me. Moved me. Grabbed & held my attention every second until the end. Find a quiet time to immerse yourself in this movie. You won't regret it.
" To the makers of the film ""thank you""
",2019-05-26 00:00:00,7,"Let me start off with a disclaimer: I am an aspie. A mild aspie, but an aspie nonetheless. I can get very upset at times, at other times I can become very nervous, and am anxious a lot of the time. I write and I act for many reasons, but one of the biggest is that through those films I can express the things I otherwise can't bring myself to. I suppose that's why I'm writing this. The average perception of those on the spectrum is as follows: Weird, odd, sad, different. We're seen as someone to pity or someone who's an easy target for a joke. The media doesn't do us many favours either, with films tending to all stick to common stereotypes without every really looking underneath. At least, that's how it feels. X+Y is a film that looks underneath, and I love it for that. (And yes, I'm aware it took nine lines until I actually started talking about the film, and for that I apologise. I'll try to make up for it) I will admit, this film was sometimes hard to watch for me, and that some scenes hit very close to home. This film doesn't shy away from the truth, nor does it allow itself to be clouded by sentimentality. This film was directed by a documentary filmmaker, and you can tell; the film is involved, up close, personal, and always strives to convey the truth. Basically, this film gets it. I don't think I've felt as strong an emotional connection to a film in a very long time. The characters were beautifully written and performed by the stellar cast, but I feel a special mention has to be given to three of the actors in particular: Asa Butterfield, who portrays Nathan with such grace and skill, and captures the mannerisms and inner struggles of those on the spectrum brilliantly. The character is well written, yes, but I honestly can't imagine any other actor in the role. It is without a doubt the best performance of his career, and if he doesn't win SOMETHING for his role, I will be incredibly disappointed. He turns the character into a real person, a real person who just thinks and acts a little differently to everyone else. A real person who deserves to be treated as anyone else would, and not looked down upon. Words cannot describe how good he is in this film (and I could say the same about the two others to come). Justwow. A great performance. Sally Hawkins, who portrays Nathan's mother Julie with such warmth, such heart and such believability. Not only does the film focus on Nathan alone, it also focuses on those he cares about, Julie in particular. She's someone who has sacrificed so much, and has had to care for her son on her own. She understands why Nathan doesn't want to hold her hand or talk to her, but understanding doesn't make it any easier for her to deal with, and still feels that she doesn't understand Nathan at all. Sally Hawkins, bravo. Finally, Jake Davies, who plays the character Luke. And honestly, I'm at a loss for words. I cried at most of the moments he was on screen: I cried out of recognition of both my younger self and of those I have met further up the spectrum than myself. I once knew someone just like Luke, and one scene in particular which involves a re-enactment of a famous comedy sketch almost felt like it came from real life. I was never really like Luke, but I've met plenty of people who are, and to see people like him represented in a film is brilliant. People like Luke Shelton exist in every school, and are all treated the same: bullied, and made fun of or belittled. It's not their fault that they insult people; they don't do it deliberately, they just don't understand how people can be offended. They don't read faces or hear speech patterns like the average person does, but that doesn't mean that people like Luke don't feel emotion themselves. They do, they really do. And Jake Davies conveys that brilliantly, and even manages to make us laugh a few times. (I noticed I said ""I'm at a loss for words"" and yet managed to talk about his performance the most. Go figure.) I forgot I was looking at actors; I just saw real people. (As a side note, I adored every performance in the film, it's just that those three touched me the most).To the makers of this film: thank you. Justthank you. You have made an aspie who sometimes feels like nobody understands realise that people do understand. This film is just glorious, fantastic and truthful. People, spread the word! All must watch this! Make sure that X+Y doesn't get overshadowed, and make sure you go in knowing as little as possible. Don't watch the trailer like I did, because it gives away far too much.My favourite film of 2014, and one of my favourites of all time. A masterpiece, plain and simple.EDIT: Wow. Looked back on this review after a few months and was stunned by the amount of attention it got. Also was sorry to hear that a few people didn't like the film. Ah well. If this review managed to get a few more people to see the film, then that's grand. A few users have said some reviews misled them, and if mine was one of them, well then I'm sorry you were disappointed. Really, I am. It's a shame you didn't like it as much as I did, and it was never my intention to mislead. Basically, the above review still reflects how I felt when I first watched the film. If you didn't like the film, then I'm sorry. I still love X+Y. And if you don't...you don't. OPINIONS! (Cue Seinfeld music and laugh-track as I slide away from my laptop)"
" Good at math but not geography or history plus stereotyping Asian women
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,2,"The UK team first went to Taipei, Taiwan, to meet with the Chinese team. All the Chinese team including the girl worn team uniforms with a Taiwan (Republic of China) flag. Yet, in Cambridge, suddenly the Taiwan team becomes China team wearing uniforms with a China (People of Republic China) flag.And, yea, all the Asian girls like white boys. What a stereotype! The girl is way too forward to be believable.The movie tried to deal with a few human emotion issues but none have be dealt with depth."
" What a great film
",2018-10-26 00:00:00,10,"This film has to be one of my favourites from 2014. I have watched this film just twice and each time I thoroughly enjoy it. I find it to be very well paced and everything to be a mystery.The music they add is spot on all the way through to the credits which gives the movie that extra star. At one point the music may have been a little to loud but you can still hear the characters speak.The ending for me was great! I know some people didn't enjoy it but I would have hated if he had gone on to win the olympiad competition. The fact that he had been training for years then leaves during it for a girl is a little cheesy but another element of surprise as I doubt many of us expected that to happen.(I apologise for my bad grammar, and some use of words)"
" I want more ;)
",2018-09-24 00:00:00,10,"A kind of movie that you would like to last longer, the one you don't want to be over..."
" Okay movie, u can skip watching.
",2018-08-23 00:00:00,7,"The story is about a boy named Nathan who has a gifted mind. He is brilliant in mathematics. The story is his journey if he would get into School of mathematics, Trinity, Dublin.I am a man of science. I like the scenario where the elements of logic and reasoning are used. I like the stories rotating around people on the basis of discussed elements.The story appears different since I watched it for the first time. It seems as the ending has been changed. First time was if he was successful with his Chinese counterpart. This time it was as if he chooses social life over academic. All I expected was a better balance. This is where it loses a point.Final Verdict: It's an okay movie, u can skip watching."
" Superb Filmmaking!
",2018-04-18 00:00:00,10,"Watched this last night and I enjoyed it. The filmmakers did an excellent job of conveying what it is like for a family going through life with a child with Aspergers and when tragedy hits. All of the actors did a tremendous job and I especially enjoyed Asa Butterfield, he is a very talented young actor and puts his everything into roles like this. The ending was perfect and very touching for anyone who has lost someone they love and who is on their journey through life."
" Brilliant
",2018-03-29 00:00:00,10,"This is honestly my favourite film ever. Every aspect of it is so perfect, the way it represents teenagers is just fantastic, focusing on those other than the stereotypical cool kids and even managing to subvert the stereotypes of the 'nerd' characters. The way that the characters are developed is truly awe inspiring, each chapter is shaped, crafted, made truly human. The icing on the cake is the fantastic visuals, this film has an organic, natural beauty, the way it's shot feels so warm, so right, so natural. This, paired with the fantastically beautiful score this film is just too much to love and I do, I really do, I love it all."
" It falls below expectations but not too bad.
",2018-01-04 00:00:00,6,"So as a fan of math and Asa Butterfield I really expected something out of this film...And from the trailers and clips I watched I thought this is going to be great...But it turns out the film in general is too BLAND. So there wasn't much excitement within this film. The between romance between Zhengmei and Nathan in this film is also quite bland, with a bitch on the UK math team that eventually ruined it. The romance between Mr. Humphrey and Nathan's mom didn't come to a full circle either. After all the kisses and such,did they marry each other finally or live together? There are a lot of things that leave the audiences to question and I personally don't like that. So the ending basically made the film worse. A lot of other things didn't come to full circle neither. How did the UK team do on IMO? Did nathan escape with Zhangmei or something happened(I just can't figure it out it's really vague at the end when Nathan holds Zhangmei's hand on the train)? When Mr. Humphrey locked the other man (I forget his name) in the IMO room what happened? At the end it just feels like: Oh what, that's it?But there are still some good things: the cultural exchange portraited in this film is quite interesting. And the fact that this film is about math and autism made it unique. It was nice to watch except at the end, and it kinda motivates me to study math."
" movie is make with love
",2017-12-26 00:00:00,10,"I love the movie ....
you have to watch it !
and hope you enjoy it"
" A well performed strong script.
",2017-12-03 00:00:00,8,"I randomly selected this film to watch and as i started to watch it, i gone into flow. Impressed with the actors work. Although somewhere the connection drops but it again makes strong connection. Beautiful way to show inner conflicts on the screen. Transformation is average. Overall this film is a good cinematic entertainment. As a film maker me also like to work on conflicts and temptations, so these kind of films are treat to me."
" Logic vs Emotions
",2017-08-27 00:00:00,8,"(Flash Review)An honest look of life through the eyes of a socially awkward, mathematics wiz. This young boy is found to have highly advanced aptitude with numbers which offset his social interaction abilities. Over a few years, he is taught by a former math genius who has MS and is trying to help his pupil get into a world-wide Math Olympics before his body fails him. While the film is fairly light on math, considering the subject, it focuses more on this boys relationships with his mother, teacher, female interest, other math teammates as well as gaining his personal confidence all from the perspective of a person that may have some level of Aspergers. The film engineered many scenarios for the boy to interact socially and how his personality matured and grew. He almost takes comfort and hides under numbers to avoid human interactions so in the end will he be able to uncloak himself from numbers and enhance his human relationships? The cinematography was stellar and this subject was able to generate true tension at times. A noble storytelling effort."
" A good movie showing ideology of a autistic mind
",2017-07-20 00:00:00,7,This movie is about a child who is autistic but has a unique interest in maths. The ending of this movie takes a drastic change that we would have never thought of. I can say that Asa Butterfield did a great job acting as an autistic child but I don't think I can say the same for Rafe Spalls who is his teacher. The story also needed a bit more polishing I think. In all the movie is good and is definitely watchable.
" I usually enjoy kid prodigy films but this one was... meh
",2017-05-30 00:00:00,5,"The person that this movie was based on I am sure had a really hard time losing his dad and dealing with his autism, however in the movie the performance given by Asa Butterfield is as one dimensional as you can get. The majority of his scenes were him saying nothing at all, just sitting there with a dumb look on his face. FYI, please don't start criticizing me for this comment, I completely understand that he is portraying someone with autism and that they have a difficult time relating socially with people, what I am saying is that his portrayal just doesn't make for an interesting character in a film. His character was really boring. I am sure it is being true to life, but even at math he wasn't the best, he was just pretty good, at least good enough to get into a math Olympiad but barely! I am not sure what is supposed to be fascinating or interesting about this character? Even with his autism the portrayal of him in the movie was of a shy socially awkward teenager who says mean things to his mom and isn't as ""clever"" as other boys. This could have been any number of normal awkward teenage boys, even though this one happened to have autism, it didn't add anything unique to his character. They tried to show some scenes of him walking around and seeing all of the lights in the city in double, I am assuming they were trying to show his light sensitivity or his synesthesia but it wasn't portrayed very vividly or in any way where a ""normal"" person could go, ""oh is that what that is like? wow!"". It was just him seeing some ""blurry"" lights. The other character, Jake, was actually way more interesting and deep than Asa's character. He had real issues and was actually interesting. He said things, he struggled, he fought with his peers, he fixated on that Monty Python film clip, he scratched himself. The scene of him in the bathroom was great. Real emotion, depth, and struggle. However in that scene, Asa didn't even say anything!! He just stood there, again, with a dumb look on his face. I won't continue on and on, but I will just say the majority of the rest of the film was also cliché and slow. Girl meets awkward boy and falls for him anyway. Chinese girl who feels pushed to ""succeed"" for her family. Cliché idealized back flashes to main character and his dad. Etc. Etc. Overall really disappointed in this film."
" compelling characters
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,7,"Nathan Ellis (Asa Butterfield) is confused by normal human interactions. His father Michael told him that his superpower is his math abilities but Michael is killed in a car accident when he was a kid. His mother Julie (Sally Hawkins) struggles alone. At school, Nathan is bullied except for irreverent math teacher Martin Humphreys (Rafe Spall). They work towards the International Mathematics Olympiad which Martin was a former participant. Nathan gets accepted and sent to Taipei for math camp led by Richard (Eddie Marsan). He finds other socially awkward math geniuses and Zhang Mei who is often dismissed for being the niece of the Chinese team coach.The best scene is Sally Hawkins ordering Chinese takeout. This has some good characters, and some good scenes. Asa Butterfield plays autistic well. It would help the story by compressing several of the elements. Going to Taipei adds a little exoticism but it separated Nathan from his two important connections. The story would be more dramatic if he has to deal with Julie and Martin's budding romance. There is simply more possibilities if everybody stays together. The students are great character additions. The movie would work better by concentrating on math camp and staying at home."
" Well-acted drama that boasts of true emotion
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,8,"It's a film about a teenage boy who's not quite like everyone else, I believe autism was the diagnosis he was given.He does not communicate very well but is beyond smart, I am not a very good communicator myself so I can most definitely relate to that and there are some scenes that get genuinely emotional for me (and anyone else I imagine with half a heart).Perhaps I'd wish for a more complete ending but maybe that would been a little too Hollywoodesque and this is after all a movie that is very much rooted in reality so it made sense I suppose to end it the way they did.7.5/10."
