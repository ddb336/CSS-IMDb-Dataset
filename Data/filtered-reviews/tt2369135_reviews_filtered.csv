" Didn't disappoint
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,10,"I want cars not explosions. Unlike Fast and furious this movie has cars and races believe it or not, as expected from need for speed. The team is cool and the story is easy and enjoyable."
" Dumbed Down Fast & Furious Clone!
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,5,"The Need for Speed looks good. At 132 minutes it's quite a long movie and with its dramatic content almost solely resting on extreme driving, it's unsurprising that it was directed by an ex - stuntman. Character development is shoved very much to the back seat, though Aaron Paul is more than acceptable in the lead role of former race car driver Tobey Marshall. Trouble is the rest of his team are just ciphers; they're there just to do various things to propel the plot forward and then, frequently, in sublimely unbelievable ways. None are drawn with anywhere near the depth of Dominic Toretto's extended family. Imogen Poots as Julia, an English car broker, manages to establish a reasonable chemistry as Paul's character's love interest. But even still, the actions her character takes, again fly in the face of reality. This extends even further with examples such as Michael Keaton's Monarch: a reclusive and eccentric host of a highly illegal ""underground"" supercar race competition called the De Leon. He operates from a lighthouse on a small farm where he lives, but even though he streams his races online and does live commentary (where clearly Keaton has been given carte blanche by the director, to ham it up unmercifully), he remains an unidentified enigma to the clueless authorities.Swiss cheese like plot holes like this abound in the narrative. A major aspect of the story hinges on Tobey Marshall being held responsible for an illegal race, organised by chief villain Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper): a former Indy racer and Tobey's fierce rival. Brewster directly causes the death of another character, yet the police tell Marshall, there's no evidence of Brewster being involved with the race. Apparently in the world Need for Speed inhabits, there's no such thing as dash - cams, car registrations, or witnesses to multiple crashes involving the racing cars interactions with innocent bystanders' vehicles. Similarly during the running of the De Leon, the ""Smokies"", clearly suffer major losses as reported by Monarch, yet Marshall, is head - shakingly only given a 6 month sentence, before being set free to spin drift off into the sunset.I know the movie is only based on a video - game and many will say, we shouldn't expect high drama. But I for one, don't believe you should need to slam your brain into reverse gear to appreciate polished looking cinema vehicles like Need for Speed, which run on empty, character and story wise."
" Not satisfying
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,5,"This film is a good example of how less is often more. At over 2 hours, it is far too long, and director Scott Waugh leads us along various clichés that reach a negative climax in Michael Keaton's ""Monarch"". Overacting of the highest order and a character that is as superfluous as a goitre. Otherwise, it is already clear after a few minutes where the journey is going and it is told without any surprises. Yes, the racing scenes are exciting, but everything else is rather implausible or clichéd. Let's leave it at that this film is okay for a boring covid evening, but absolutely not for anything more."
" Excellent.....for racing action
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,8,"If you choose to watch this movie, the chances are that you are doing so to watch slick, exciting racing of super cars. If so you won't be disappointed. This is a well produced, well directed action film that had some truly spectacular racing action, made even more realistic with the minimum use of CGI.
If on the other hand you are looking for added drama, relationship development, nuanced acting and subtlety, then you are going to be very, very disappointed...."
" Enjoyable
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,8,"Fantastic movie. Loved the games when I was a kid, and kinda relived it. Its pure about racing.
I think its better then the last 7 movies from Fast And The Furious"
" Aaron Paul is amazing
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,10,Feel this film needs better recognition than it's given people comparing it to fast and furious are ridiculous it's nothing like it apart from cars racing that is the only similarity this has a brilliant story and Aaron Paul is amazing and deserves bigger roles like this defo watch you won't be disappointed fantastic story great acting funny and action packed love it xx
" is aite i gues
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,7,I dont understand how a shelby gonna beat the super cars in the end of the movie it would have stood no chance even if it made it to the end but anyway 7/10 decent watch
" Its actually pretty good... but
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,7,"This film really annoys me because its actually quite good. The cars are amazing, the racing scenes are also very good, the scenes / locations that are in this film are awesome too. The story plot is even ok, its just the final race that spoils it all.The whole point of the final race is the winner takes all the cars hence millions of dollars, but all of the cars get destroyed so it kind of renders it pointless.Other than that its really good and is well worth a watch. 7 /10 is a fair rating."
" It delivers the races and crashes you could possibly desire, nothing more.
",2020-12-17 00:00:00,5,"I admire ""Need for Speed"" for its realistic car action scenes and glossy cinematography (courtesy of Shane Hurlbut). But I also hate it for its preposterous plot, wooden characters, and its ironic disregard for the rules of the road for a movie that was shot in a controlled environment.The movie tells the conventional tale of Tobey Marshall, a car mechanic/pro racer who proved himself a better driver than his longtime rival (and possibly megalomaniac) Dino Brewster after test driving a custom Ford Mustang Dino made him build for as fast as 230 mph, selling it to the highest bidder for $2.7 million. (This Mustang was the one left unfinished by the death of Caroll Shelby, who was building it with Henry Ford himself.) Threatened by Tobey's reputation, Dino lends two of his three Koenigsegg Agera Rs to Tobey and one of his best friends, fellow mechanic Pete, and all three race across Mt. Kisco. Dino prevents Pete from claiming the victory by bumping his speeding car in the rear, sending Pete's Agera into the air and tumbling him to his death a la Michael Bay. After serving a two-year jail sentence for a crime he didn't commit, Tobey embarks on a high-speed quest with the cops in hot pursuit to California to beat Dino in the much-awaited underground tournament called the De-Leon, organized by a middle-aged man named Monarch, and avenge his dead friend once and for all.As a fan of the NFS video games, I'm happy to say that the adaptation's car action doesn't disappoint. Shot with little CGI (accounting for that cool digital speedometer of the Mustang), it's easy to tell the movie was insired by ""Bullitt"", whose iconic car chase between Steve McQueen and his adversary is briefly shown in the drive-in sequence. The racers in ""Need for Speed"" goes a little overboard, however, causing some traffic collisions between innocent motorists and cop cars along the way. The director, Scott Waugh, is eager to heighten the realism by plunging the viewers into the action with scenes shot from the driver and passenger's POV.Unfortunately, this ""Need for Speed"" adaptation is just another video game in search of a movie. It's so preposterously plotted that I fell asleep by the time the final act had arrived. It's a shame that its motley crew of talented cast, which includes Aaron Paul, has been let down by the cliched script by screenwriting siblings George and John Gatins. Director Scott Waugh has already made quite a name for himself as a good action filmmaker, all he needs is a better script to work with."
" Only worthy of 'nothing better to do' weekends or pandemics!
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,2,"Wow. Not much to give credit to in this one, not sure what Keaton was thinking even making an appearance in this bizarre sequence. Okay, let's start with the good: It is a great movie to put in while home sick, or where you will likely be interrupted frequently! You will miss little if you take a break at any time of this one! Here is a racing fantasy flick with a lot of racing (some nice cars, however) poor acting is par for the course here (pun intended) and plot that is barely coherent outside of revenge. The car chases/racing scenes while trying to elude police are just absolutely ridiculous and only challenge the films Smokey and the Bandit (et. al.)! The only problem is that with the Smokey films, they filmed with making the concept of making them ridiculous and funny! A big dud here, unless you have nothing else to do and don't mind some nice cars in the background."
" Greatest Movie of all time
",2020-10-07 00:00:00,10,I mean nothing needs to be said just watch the movie and you will understand.
" Possibly the best video game film
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,10,"It is possibly the best time a video game franchise has been adapted into a film, I would love to play a game version of this. The film always holds up and this is coming from a life long need for speed fan. Plus the cast is amazing and the mustang comprable to Eleanor is beauty and power"
" Why there is only 1 part made...
",2020-09-25 00:00:00,4,"To many details they forgot and many questions left... No witnesses? Come on! 3 agera r? Nope they are not! Just a simple agera.
Acting was a around the corner picked up guys and a real race and meeting has Japanese cars too. Also they were trying to make the actions like aka F&F but missing a lot of tense scenes just a plain action. Also they cant run out a cop car after they explained its power???? Wtf... Spike strips...never heard of them.Just a popcorn movie and checking your phone movie.."
" High octane fun
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,6,"This review contains spoilers.Need for Speed stars Aaron Paul as the lead character out for revenge as he is framed for deaths caused by illegal street racing. The story follows the beginning of the illegal street race to his redemption as he clears his name. The plot is an excuse to show high octane races that are fun to watch. There are elements from the video games that are present in the movie such as police chases and traps.Need for Speed is first and foremost meant to be a fun movie. From the beginning of the movie, the cast look like they are having a fun time. The fun of the movie is dragged down by the plot and main character's dreariness. The side characters however pick up the tone and the movie becomes fun again. This movie has a fun group of side characters with stand-outs played by Imogen Poots and Rami Malek. These characters are the biggest positive in the movie. The problems of the movie are its plot and its lack of drive. The plot was not engaging. The plot only seemed to be an excuse to show its more creative racing rather than form an engrossing story and world.Even though the plot is basic, I would recommend Need for Speed. It is a competently directed movie that is high octane fun.Grade: C"
" Awesome !!
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,10,"One of the best car movies ever ! Loved it, we watched it over and over again for the amazing race scenes. Really cool :) also the blonde actress is great!"
" Unnecessarily long
",2020-07-10 00:00:00,5,"This movie was so unnecessarily long, which made it terribly difficult to watch."
" Lot Of Fun
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,10,Need For Speed Was A Lot Of Fun I loved It The Final Race Scene At The End Was Awesome
" Much better than nearly all of the F&F movies
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,9,"What's up with the rating for this movie? Who doesn't like this movie... it's baffling? I'd rather watch this 100 times then have to watch another Fast & Furious assembly line production. People are saying this plot is straight forward, I don't get that at all. It builds suspense and keeps the adrenaline going right until the end. Cool soundtrack. All the cast were great. Makes me sad it wasn't a bigger hit because it's a recipe for dumber movies like F&F. And I'd like to see more like it from the director, Scott Waugh."
" Fast!
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,8,"I have zero interest in car racing of any form but I 100% loved this! Exhilarating fast paced with
plenty of drama in friendship, rivalry and loss. Brilliant!"
" 2 reasons to watch but many more not to
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,2,I only gave it a two stars and that was for the amazing lighting job done in the movie.
" Sensational
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,10,"Text: It 's been a long time since I watched a film which kept me 100% tuned till the very end. I appreciated it more, being an Nfs video game series lover.. But if we think deeper, despite the fact that we are speaking of a car racing film, it manages to demonstrate human feelings, and rare human virtues. I 've been amazed to an unexpected extent, considering that when I started playing it, I was only looking forward to listen to - fiercely roaring- engine sounds! It offers much more than that, however. A pure 10 from me.P. S. Imogen Poots is lovely!"
" Not original, but SO much fun!
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,7,"I'll keep this short and sweet (like most of the cast, haha). The story has been done MANY times before, but for good reason - it's a lot of fun! It's kind of fast and the furious-ish, but it doesn't take itself so seriously or think it's more than what it is. The supporting cast makes this movie. They are so funny and there are a few really memorable moments that I still reference. If you have a rainy afternoon or can't think of something to watch on a Friday night, watch this!"
" Way better than expected
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,8,"I was very positive surprised how good that movie is! Yeah the story is neither new nor innovative but a) is that important in an action movie? and b) let's be honest: the story(ies) of Fast & Furious (F&F) isn't either!
Aaron Paul does a great job on being the lead and the others are also very believable and likeable characters - except the main villan of course^^
I'm pretty confident that without all the F&F Hype this movie would've been received so much better! So please let your self entertain by a good filmed, action packed and funny adrenaline ride ;)"
" A godfather of racing movies
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,10,If I want to watch a gangster movie I watch the godfather if I want to watch a action movie I watch the Bourne movies and I f I want to watch a racing movie what better could you do than this.it has a simple yet interesting revenge story with thrilling car chases and stunts that are similar t movies like bullitt and smokey an d the bandit I loved it and you cant get better casting than this movie. It's a masterpiece in my eyes.
" Good film
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,8,"Very under rated movie, not the best acting but amazing action throughout"
" This movie is excellent
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,8,This movie is soo good. Non stop action and they are basically in a car the whole movie.
" Best Car Movie Ever!!!
",2020-01-30 00:00:00,10,"I know it's based on the video game franchise which I've played a few games starting with the PS1 and ending with the Xbox 360. The games are decent but LOVED this movie!! Great music, visuals, stunts, close ups, jokes, and just all around good feel. Awesome cars of course.. especially the beefed up yet sophisticated Shelby Mustang. I have a 2014 Mustang myself so really enjoy that car of course. I like the ending too where they showed off the new 2015 Mustang GT before it came out at the dealers. I watch this movie every couple months or so since I can't get enough. I hope they make another! I saw some bad reviews.. probably because they don't like cars. If you don't like cars, then you may not like this movie. I mean this movie is about cars LOL."
" Amazing Movie
",2020-01-16 00:00:00,10,"This Movie is Great, the sound is incredible, put your home theater system to use with this. Lots of Racing, lots of car scenes, really nice cars. Better then F&F, its a shame they haven't come out with a sequel. This movie does not focus on narcissist characters like ""Dwayne"". Unfortunately it got a lower rating because FF fan boys got offended. There was more racing scenes then any FF movie. The racing/driving scenes really get you into the movie and give you adrenaline. The acting was just fine, it didn't focus on 20 big shot stars who have to hear themselves speak or have
female characters beating up tall muscular men. I watch car related movies to hear cars roar not to hear the rock talk about how good he is. Please make another movie."
" GREAT CAR MOVIE
",2020-01-09 00:00:00,10,"If you were a fan of Smokie & the Bandit, The Dukes of Hazzard, Gone in 60 seconds, Gator, Then you're going to love this movie. Road car racing with the iconic Shelby Ford Mustang. Great casting for each character in this movie. Yes, it's based on a video game but they did the game Justice withers all the car scenes. Even the drive up to the beginning of the last race looks the same as the video game."
" Great stand alone fast car film!
",2020-01-09 00:00:00,8,"Like many, from the outset, I wondered if this was written by someone who didn't really care for the Fast and Furious series and wanted to do their own take. Then wound up ticking all the right boxes for a fast car film and figured it would fit right in. Did this attract the same audiences? Sure, but still offered something different.
More exotic cars, more practical stunts, better female character involvement, and car chase scenes that fit so well in a movie based off a video game.
It's a recipe for great entertainment."
" One Oscar winner and one Oscar nominee and such a stupid movie
",2019-12-17 00:00:00,2,"I have never seen more stupid and shallow movie with one Academy Award winner and one Academy Award nominee. Movie plot, conversation, emotions, acting... everything is so cheap and low budget, ax one could expect for the movie based on PC games serial. I suppose they thought that the name of the movie is enough to sell"
" Part 2?
",2019-10-10 00:00:00,9,"Good film, hope there's a second one as it could be carried on quite well and Aaron plays his part well"
" Give it a miss.
",2019-10-06 00:00:00,1,How can anyone with the intelligence to tie their own shoelaces take this seriously. Absolute rubbish.
" Better than the increasingly ridiculous Fast and Furious series.
",2019-09-09 00:00:00,7,"I watched this due to my like of Aaron Paul. I was very pleasantly surprised, going in with low expectations. I expected a very OTT race movie. Likeable hero and crew, sneer-worthy villain in Dominic Cooper. Sassy love interest in my fellow brit Imogen Poots. Michael Keaton was great as Monarch, Rami Malek also superb in minor support. Dakota Johnson bland and forgettable as ever.
What you get with Need for speed is just over two hours of solid respectable escapism, with great automotive stunts and some insanely skillful driving. Very enjoyable film. Recommended."
" My Review!
",2019-08-29 00:00:00,6,Wish need for speed had more experienced cast. Wish they had focused more on medium performance cars tuned to their limit. Wish it was exactly like NFSMW.Peace Out!
" Totally unexpected!
",2019-08-21 00:00:00,10,"I never had an interest in seeing this movie when it came out, I honestly thought it was going to be another one of those ""fast and furious"" types. Man was I wrong. The storyline is great, the acting is pretty damn good, overall an excellent movie!"
" Average: 5.0
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,5,"Movies based on video games don't exactly have the best track record when it comes to quality. The best of the bunch can be described as okay at best, and the worst ones are generally listed among the worst films of all time. Need for Speed certainly doesn't buck the trend, but it's definitely better than the vast majority of its brethren. I'm a big fan of the game series on which this film is based. The plot (a race across the country to clear one's name) is taken straight from The Run, one of the better games in the franchise. It makes for some genuinely cool stunts, some visceral destruction, and the occasional race. But where this movie falls horribly short is the dialogue. This movie has more than its fair share of cringe-worthy lines, which not even the perfectly competent acting can cover up. For those unable to bear the wait for the seventh Fast & Furious movie, this is an okay stopgap, but nothing more."
" So many questions...
",2019-07-26 00:00:00,4,"1) 5k is a lot of money to the ""good guys"" and they just earned 675k! They get their shop back from the bank but Mr. Good Guy's pride is wounded from such a stupid comment so much that he risks it all. Wouldn't his friends disown him? Why do such a stupid thing. For a smart person, accepting that racing challenge was downright stupid.2) Speaking of the race, are you telling me ZERO witnesses spotted the red Konigsegg?? Please. Dumb.3) What did Mr. Good Guy win in the end? He won all the other cars, which are now destroyed and worthless, or at best impounded. He basically won nothing. And worse yet, he went to jail for it. And worse than that, he destroyed a 3mil Shelby Mustang just for good measure. Well done!4) Why did the hummer driver think it better to smash into a wall than smash into the car he was trying to stop?5) Are you telling me Mr Good Guy had time to tame the dog and take its chain and wrap it around the cop car axles? Why not pop the hood and pull some wires instead? Or knife his tires. Silly.6) Hey Police, ever heard of spike strips???!?! I'm done. It's just not worth it."
" A refreshing change of direction from 'the other franchise'
",2019-07-14 00:00:00,9,"I love the Fast and Furious franchise and couldn't comprehend how this would be anything other than a (not so cheap) rip off.
However, the direction the story takes and how the character development progresses throughout the movie allowed me to stop my initially biased judgements and just enjoy the it for what it is.... pure fun!
The stunts and driving sequences provide a fresh perspective to the genre with their originality and grandeur.
If you're looking for Oscar winning performances and life altering drama then go elsewhere, although in my opinion I felt the cast did a great job of what they were expected to deliver. This movie is what it is, fast paced adrenaline fuelled fun with some great characters and and amazing driving stunts/sequences. Loved it!!!"
" Aaron Paul is a bad actor
",2019-07-07 00:00:00,1,"I couldn't watch more than 5 minutes of this movie, the writing is terrible, the acting is terrible, especially by Arron Paul who sounded like Nolans Batman, the cinematography is terrible, I mean they're having a street race and there are only a couple of pedestrian cars on the road which I don't think is very realistic and the closeups of Arron Pauls huge forehead made it hard to know where to look. Every one comes off as a complete a-hole, cause it's funny to nearly kill homeless people. Like I said I only watched 5 minutes of this movie but Arron Paul's ridiculously bad acting threw me off and left a bad taste in my mouth, perhaps if they casted Vin Diesel it would have been watchable."
" The scene with the....
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,10,Accountant is priceless.Male pickering is lighthearted. It gives the movie a refreshing kick.
" my notes
",2019-06-24 00:00:00,3,The cars were awesome. the race scenes were awesome. everything else was horrible. the dialogue was so bad. acting so bad. I hated all the actors except Aaron Paul who was ok (1 viewing)
" A beautiful mess of a movie
",2019-05-26 00:00:00,7,"First of all, let's be clear: by objective standards, this movie isn't very good. The plot is very thin and pretty generic, and is only there to somehow tie together all the driving scenes. The dialog and writing is hilariously bad, and the characters are shallower than an inflatable kiddie pool. Obviously, this is a movie based on a video game, but it's so badly written that it kind of gives the impression that it was written as a video game and adapted to film at the last minute.That said, this is a very fun movie to watch. The cinematography is surprisingly good, especially in the racing scenes, and there is a fantastic sense of speed and realism that a lot of other similar movies lack. It's refreshing to watch car action scenes that don't have so much blinding shakey-cam and constant cuts that you can't even tell what's going on (looking at you, Bad Boys II). It's worth watching just for how well done the driving scenes are, assuming you can suspend disbelief for the action scenes and follow along with a protagonist who's a bit of a jerk to almost everyone in his life.All of the street racers who are supposedly the heroes are immature, selfish and hugely irresponsible, although I guess that's par for the course in a street racing movie. Aaron Paul's character is supposed to be some kind of macho badass, but is a pretty big jerk to almost everyone, especially Imogen Poots' character, who has very little character development and is mostly only there as eye candy for male viewers, and could be written out completely with no major changes to the storyline. Not that the male characters are much better, mind you - there's one guy whose entire personality is that he has a toothpick in his mouth all the time. Characters are not this movie's strong suit.It's not exactly a gearhead movie, either. The script pays little attention to the car enthusiast audience, and focuses more on making the cars look cool than making them plausible. The Mustang seems to have a manual transmission in some scenes and an automatic in others, there are numerous over-the-top crashes that get sillier the closer you look, and of course, there's the obligatory big jump scene that every car chase movie has, which the car inexplicably survives with no damage at all. It's hard to tell if this movie is paying homage to the cheesy chase movies of the past, or if the writers actually thought they were working on a Smokey & The Bandit reboot. Either way, it will be tons of fun for some viewers and tiresome (hehe) for others.The plot is a pretty standard revenge story. It tries to wring out a moral of some sort at the end, and when I was a teenager, I thought it was a fantastic ending. From an adult perspective, it's painfully predictable, but I will give it points for being much better than the ending of the first Fast & Furious movie.Bottom line: if you enjoy car chases and ""so bad it's good"" movies, you'll love this one. It's a decent addition to the canon of cheesy car chase movie. If you're looking for good characters and a meaningful story, keep looking."
" Did I just watch a Ford commercial?
",2019-05-04 00:00:00,4,"Not enough car action. The plot is basically about a friend who dies during a race and someone being held responsible until the end of the movie. There are Bugatti and other cars but not really a hell of a lot to see. Most of the movie revolves around a cross-country race in a hot Ford Mustang with the police not far behind. Where are the Japanese tuners? Nowhere to be seen. A Mustang out of the factory is pretty damn slow compared to Japanese tuners so if you are persuaded by this movie to buy one check the specifications and make sure you are tall, wear sunglasses and have a goatee beard."
" LOVED EVERY DEATIL ! ! !
",2019-04-21 00:00:00,9,"When I started watching this movie on TV, I expected fast cars, street racing, crazy cop chases, drifting and explosions and that's exactly what I got! Moreover, the movie fascinated me as besides the above mentioned there were also pictured love, love to the family, love to the brother and to the racing. Since now, I have watched this film a couple times and it still is pretty good to watch and I will surely watch it in the future. The only reason is that I did not give it 10 starts is the following. As the movie is strongly linked to the video game it lacked the character development. In my opinion this is the only bad side of the whole movie. Although the characters are good, the actors are well chosen and play is good, they are not not fully developed, which as it was said, is understandable as its based on a video game. so to sum up this film is for people who like fast and beautiful cars, crazy stunts and cars chases, who enjoy getting chased by the cops in the video game and who like the presence of a bit of emotion in the action movie."
" F0ck ROTTEN TOMATOES
",2019-04-04 00:00:00,10,"I saw the rotten tomatoes before watching this movie. Rotten tomatoes has always bashed down on my favorite movies of all time, so I knew I would love this movie.And i was right. This is such a good movie and need for speed 2019 game needs a good story like this. I'm so sad that I didnt even know this came out! I suck as a fan of the games.I would love to see another need for speed movie, this was absolutely at the Fast and the furious franchise level, and honestly it can be even better."
" Need For Speed Review
",2019-03-25 00:00:00,7,"Mechanic Tobey Marshall (Paul) is framed for the death of his friend by racer Dino Brewster (Cooper). After two years in the clink, he sets off on a road trip of revenge, bent on besting Dino at De Leon - a legendary underground street race.
You can just imagine the pitch that gave rise to Need For Speed. ""It'll be the new Fast & Furious! We'll base it on a huge gaming IP, throw in some young, affordable actors and pack it with car porn. Win! You think we need a hook? Huh. Say, have you seen Breaking Bad?""
And so Aaron Paul, who delivers what is arguably the best performance in one of television's most lauded dramas, ends up driving across America in a film that makes Fast 6 look like Battleship Potemkin. It's not so much that Need For Speed is stupid, which is all but mandatory in this genre, but that stuntman-turned-director Scott Waugh fails to work the trick that Diesel et al have down pat: make the stupidity fun.
The car-eography lacks much of the balls-out audacity we've come to enjoy from pistonhead outings, stuck mostly in second gear thanks to lethargic editing and an over-reliance on long shots. That one (bafflingly over-wrought) set-piece involves Imogen Poots climbing out of a window to fill the car up with petrol should tell you all you need to know about the level of invention on show here.
It doesn't have the video game to blame either, sharing almost nothing beyond the title and opting for an entirely new story that doesn't bear a great deal of scrutiny. You'll never understand why Dino (Dominic Cooper) not only leaves damning evidence lying about but keeps a shortcut to it on his desktop, nor how Michael Keaton's mysterious DJ/race organiser manages to keep his identity secret while live-broadcasting his show via webcam. But as Paul and Poots dangle upside down over the Grand Canyon arguing about whose eyes are bluer, what will baffle most is how a film called Need For Speed can feel so slow.
Paul emerges as the film's one saving grace, imbuing Tobey with steely earnest and storming through the revenge-themed bunkum with complete abandon. As his first post-Pinkman lead, however, this is a disappointing misstep for an actor of Paul's potential."
" Not the best but I loved it

" much worse than the Fast & Furious series
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,5,"It's much worse than the Fast & Furious series. The film, which should have been very popular, was destroyed by poor rhythm and incongruous music. The plot is simple and unreasonable. For example: Why did the car theft alarm say that two cars were lost? Did the police investigate the cause of the accident? The whole film ends with a six-car show that will make a living."
" Need For Speed is a awesome movie!!!!
",2019-02-17 00:00:00,10,This movie was really great and very entertaining. I really enjoyed when the mustang evaded the cops.
" Doesn't makes sense
",2019-02-17 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed this movie quite a lot and on my more than 5 watch. I'm not picky about many details but I think the writers of this movie just randomly picked a fast car (Agera R), place it in the movie and didn't do some research.
It doesn't really make sense to destroy a 3+ million dollar car to win 2.7 million race and hiding another 3+ million worth of same car.
Secondly, for a car that only 18 are built, no matter how much money you have, you can't own 3 at once!"
" It was ok.
",2019-01-15 00:00:00,5,It was an alright movie. More like shut down brain and watch type lol
" My review for Fast and Furious...errr
",2018-12-17 00:00:00,6,Trying so hard to be a good F&F clone. But it is still quite a bit of fun to watch. Aaron Paul needs to get more work. He was brilliant along side Cranston In breaking bad.
" Overall descent movie, but often a poor choice of music and timing
",2018-10-27 00:00:00,7,"I liked this film, but what the hell was with the music? It was not fitting at all. And often songs would just go on forever. Which made some cool and romantic moments look really cheezy.Gotta shout out Linkin park's song 'Roads untraveld' though. Obviously a great deserved to better used than this."
" Best Movie Ever
",2018-10-14 00:00:00,10,I dont care if anyone hates this movie because this is the best movie I've ever seen. I love the story that this movie offers and the action scene are absolutely amazing. It's easily the best movie based of a video game and is my No.1 favourite movie of all time. I wish someday that EA will make a sequel to this amazing film.
" What fast and furious failed to do
",2018-09-10 00:00:00,8,"I am a car nerd.. I can sit and study the curves ore stats of a car for hours. This movie is aimed at people like me, we want awsome engine sounds, drifts, backfiers and so on and this movie delivers just that. We don't care that much about the story, I have watched this movie several time even tho I know the lines just to see the cars. Many people including me claims that fast and furious lost it's car routs and is now a action move with less and less focus on the cars and even from the beginning you could tell that knew nothing about cars trhoing random words in to a conversations. But need for speed knows what they are talking about (most of the time) although there are some stupid mistakes that only needs like me notices like for example 0* they claim there is 3 agera r in the koenigsegg race but one of them is an normal agera and they do not have Swedish license plates and one misses a splitter * the bugatti has the wrong air intakes *McLaren p1 spoiler does not lift up *Lamborghini's windows does not lower irl These things are not important but would easily been avoided with some research 
 
So to sum it upStort 4/10 but action cars and so on 11/10"
" This is for Pete!!
",2018-08-10 00:00:00,9,"First things first, I need to get this off my chest. ""This is for Pete!!"" Everyone, including people who knows Pete and others who never met him or probably met him once says this dialogue! Come on, Pete is a kid mechanic, he's not a world-class racing car driver or the most important person on earth that everyone keeps chanting his name. I get it that Tobey and his friends keep saying it which makes sense, but the British babe who probably met him once and the De Leon presenter who probably never heard of him keeps saying this sounds a bit ridiculous! Pete, great going mate, you have been immortalised by everyone in the NFS universe!Besides this small niggle, this is an awesome film. I can't imagine the number of times I watched the police-chase scene or the office strip-tease scene! The office scene is pure ingenious. I fell in love with Mustang after seeing this film and might even consider getting one. There are ridiculous, over-the-top action scenes but what did you expect? This is a fun, logic-defying film made out of a hugely successful video game franchise. Acting wise, Aaron Paul was spot on. He underplayed his role with super cool attitude and it totally works. His gang of friends are equally impressive with a special mention to Rami Malek for the impressive office strip scene. And then, Imogen Poots with her super-cute British Accent was a delight to watch. (I loved the way she says ""Oh! For my mug shot"" just before the police chase scene!)So, a totally fun move and I recommend it if you are a fan of this genre. For me, I like this move more than the Fast And Furious series."
" ANITA CAR
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,6,"Dino (Dominic Cooper), the darling of Mt. Kisco, NY races formula cars. Everyone knows Toby (Aaron Paul) is a better racer, although he just street races...except for maybe Anita (Dakota Johnson) his ex-gf who now travels with Dino. Through a series of impossible circumstances, Toby gets arrested for stealing Dino's uncle car, which he didn't. Upon getting out of jail, he will travel from NY to California in 45 hours aka ""Smokey and the Bandit."" Imogen Poots takes the role of Sally Fields. He is going to participate in an unsanctioned, ""winner take all"" pink slip race. Oh yes, he is on parole too and can't leave NY and must drive three times the speed limit to make it in time. He doesn't quite make it by ground and needs to be lifted by a friend in a helicopter for the last leg...something they should have done to begin with. He now must face Dino in the race.This whole script was stupid. The first thing any investigator wants to know about a stolen vehicle is ""Where are the keys?"" The idea that hot chicks hang out at a drive-in for local race drivers instead of texting their bff all night is old school and made me ask, ""When was this film made?"" Dino is a great philosopher, ""Forget the past. It's history."" He also makes up all kind of ridiculous Anita puns. They also have an aircraft fly overhead for safety, i.e. let them know when there is traffic, but that information didn't seem to effect their driving as they sped through red lights in a cop-less town.The personalities ranged from bland to bad. 130 minutes of mostly car action, not much in the way of building a believable tale.
A preteen or young teen film. A tad more believable than ""Death Race 2000"" but not nearly as entertaining.Parental Guide: No f-bombs. No sex. Male rear nudity."
" Great movie just what I expected
",2018-07-17 00:00:00,10,"Great movie, people have to remember it's a movie based on a very popular game, the movie is just what it should be amazing cars, cops, speed and cheesy lines loved it"
" so sick breh
",2018-06-21 00:00:00,8,"Might not have put my say in if i didnt see so many bad reviews... i dunno if someone payed people to write bad reviews or if someone put hate pills in everyones coolaid..not oscar winning movie but it was never ment to be. the movie is based on a video game but really has nothing to do with the movie other than the title.definatly easier to watch if you are a car enthusiast. the need for speed scenes are super totally tits. im not really a mustang enthusiast either. the one in gone in 60 seconds is nicer. why is this one not black?as for the cast. aaron paul did a great job. this is important since people thot he was only gonna be jesse pinkman forever. imogen poots is so hot i would drink her bathwater. ramen malek is usually pretty annoying, he was here too but thats what his character was supposed to be so it worked. kid cudi another rapper kanye started who is now an actor, basically played himself so it worked. dominic cooper great villian, he really feels like a douchebag. harrison gilbertson was a great little spider man. all topped off with great little snippits of michael keaton.haters gonna hate. a well rounded movie."
" Fast cars, shallow plot...
",2018-06-09 00:00:00,6,"If you liked ""Fast and Furious"" movies, then you will definitely also like ""Need For Speed"".The movie had a fairly good cast, except for Aaron Paul whom seemed very unfit for a role such as that. It was nice to see Dominic Cooper, Michael Keaton and Rami Malek perform in the movie though.There is lots of fast car scenes throughout the course of the movie, although they were rather unrealistic much like ""Fast and Furious"".Funny how there weren't any police or state troopers along the ride, all the way to California, especially since they were driving so fast all the time.""Need for Speed"" suffers from a very predictable storyline and it was rather shallow in contents. But other than that, it was actually good brainless fun and entertainment."
" I loved it
",2018-05-27 00:00:00,9,I love this movie. Everything about it was awesome
" Awful
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,1,"Truly awful, words can't describe how bad this movie is."
" its aite
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,6,"You get what you get when you see a movie like this mostly based on a video game but i have to admit i didnt find it so bad i thought it was aite i guess ... the plot of the movie kinda had me lost i mean he was supposed to take a shelby mustang to a race where there are SUPER CARS that can move 10 times faster then that car he drove thru half the movie i didnt see him come close to winning even if he had gotten the car there but then again that is my opinion 
but overall i give it a 4 cool cars"
" Worst film made in the last century.
",2018-05-11 00:00:00,1,This film might have stood a chance if it didn't feature so many unrealistic Ford Mustangs and Aaron Paul's less than poor acting... his massive forehead penalizes this film even further.There is nothing good about this film. Skip it at any cost.
" Better than Fast and Furious Series
",2018-03-02 00:00:00,8,"Now i will be honest when i say i've only played a few Need For Speed Games so i will be reviewing this as an average watcher rather than a massive fan of the series.Simply put I don't hate this Movie, if anything I enjoy it, the movie doesn't throw anything in your face like the Fast and Furious Franchise, it's more down to earth with more likeable and believable characters, the star power behind the movie is better than its counterparts, Aaron Paul of Breaking Bad fame is incredible as the lead, Dominic Cooper the Villain does a wonderful job of being a conniving one.I honestly wouldn't know what to say this is just a movie i really like."
" Better than expected
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,8,"Honestly, Ive watched this a couple times now and it still is pretty good to watch. You can tell many of the reviewers never played the game series at all, when a majority of the negative reviews use ""Extremely Unrealistic"" and ""Too many police chases"" as a negative argument. If you are looking for a reviewer who has played through every game in the series, then read this.To be honest, when I first saw the trailer, I thought it was going to be a typical cash grab film based on a popular game series. After watching it, I was very happy. They managed to add in everything that was enjoyable within the games. Fast cars, High speed police chases and good looking girls (Yes I think tthat Julia is on par with Nikki, Mia and Rachel). I don't care what anyone says, The characters are likeable but not fuly developed, which is understandable as its based on a video game, the humour is decent and the plot is enjoyable in my eyes. The only thing I wanted from the feel were little things that would have given the film a more NFS feeling, Such as the iconic chase musicand more ephasis on building and tuning the car at the start (Not spoiling make/model).Overall, The movie is solid.I have watched it multiple times and I will keep watching it in the future as it is better than what I originally expected it to be."
" More than incredible
",2018-02-23 00:00:00,10,"Within 4 years I watched this movie over 10 times! Yes, it is so incredible.
I liked the fast cars, the beautiful men, the thrill ... the need.
The hint of nascent love. Thirst for revenge. And the goodness of Toby."
" Fantastic Movie. Don't listen to the haters
",2017-11-13 00:00:00,10,I love car movies and I knew I would love this even though it's a different cast to The Fast Furious and I loved Paul Walker but it's really good movie. I could watch it over and over again and not get bored of watching it plus hot actors. I remember going to the cinema to see this and remember leaving feeling that was awesome. Love Aaron Paul and Dominic Cooper.
" Amazing.....RUSH is the impact I got! 7+ Stars!
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,7,"And I'm a woman! I watched it alone and sweat was coming out of my pores the entire time. I know about Mustangs. I know about Bugattis. I didn't know about many of the different types of fast cars though. That Bugatti was sweet. All I want to say after watching this movie is....'This is for Pete' and I'll add to it for him.....'You Dirty Rotten Scoundrel!'....Justice SERVED!! Enjoy the ride, PHEW! It's worth it!"
" They should adapt Most Wanted!
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,7,"I have mixed feelings towards this movie. I loved it and it was fun. I wasn't expecting much, after all, it's not supposed to be Oscar material. Plus, Aaron Paul was as cute as ever in this.The action is decent, and the premise is simple. Some things about the plot really don't make any sense and get a little annoying over time. But whoever's played the video games, especially the ""newer"" ones, from 2005 and on, knows that they also have that there. The NFS for cell phone also has this stupid ""story"" that no one cares about. But for the record, some things that annoyed me were:1 - One dimensional characters; 2 - Dakota Johnson pre-50 Shades hasn't really changed at all, it's just as if she's already playing Anastasia, dull and dumb all the way, dating the rich douche; 3 - 45 hours of cross-country driving and no one needs to pee or eat? Only one refueling and one gas stop? OK... 4 - Hey, lend me your 2.5 million car so I can destroy it! 5 - The chase in the desert was ultra stupid (how did they know they were there?) 6 - And, the worst part of it all, the truck crashing into them and leaving. I mean, WTF??? In downtown SF?? Really? And nobody saw that? It was completely pointless and unnecessary. If he needed a new car, they could've found some problem in the Mustang, or whatever.Overall, I enjoyed it a lot, but I would like more character development. And please adapt MOST WANTED! It's THE BEST!"
" Another nonsense car racing film
",2017-08-01 00:00:00,3,"NEED FOR SPEED is a dreadful addition to the 'car race' genre of movie-making, one that's based on a popular video game series. It's not as bad as the worst I've seen, SPEED RACER, but it's still largely unwatchable and totally clichéd from beginning to end. A film which dumbs down the story to the lowest common denominator at every point. Aaron Paul gives a rubbish, workmanlike turn as the supposed hero of the piece, while Dominic Cooper is the supposed villain but is far more charming than Paul. The less said about the token and embarrassing role for Imogen Poots, the better. There are a lot of racing scenes here but they all seem to end with the same CGI car flipping stunt and they quickly become tiresome. Give me the outlandishness of the FAST & FURIOUS franchise over this nonsense any day of the week."
" Brilliant
",2017-07-21 00:00:00,10,"It's a car movie..... A brilliant car movie with great cars, actors and soundtrack. This is my favorite car movie ever! For me it has a therapeutic feel, like a surf movie, a simple concept with a deeper under current. Aaron Paul is awesome, no CGI! No one has suddenly learn't how to use a gun or be able to fight....they're drivers. I love it. The instrumental soundtrack is beautiful. Great car film."
" Fast action and excitement. 10*
",2017-07-11 00:00:00,10,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this one. I never played the game, but I was interested. Need For Speed is comparable to Fast and Furious. There is a villain and Tobey Marshall is out to clear his name. In my opinion, NFS is better. The racing and excitement start at the beginning and continues throughout as Marshall is drawn into a cross country race. The cast is excellent as well with Michael Keaton (one of my favorites), Aaron Paul and Dominic Cooper. If you haven't seen this yet, check it out!"
" Mediocre acting, specially Aaron Paul's
",2017-06-20 00:00:00,4,"Even though there were multiple characters with a less than spectacular performance, like Harrison Gilbertson's (Little Pete), Aaron's was more notable as his was of a leading actor. All his lines in this movie were cringe worthy, absolutely no chemistry with the romantic interest, awkward acting, all in all, i can't really see him as a leading man. Other than that, it was fun to watch, in a watered down fast and furious kind of way."
" Simple plot but great car action
",2017-06-13 00:00:00,8,"Tobey Marshall owns a garage on Mount Kisco, New York where he tunes high performance cars with his friends. He isn't too pleased when Dino Brewster, a rival from his racing days, turns up but he has an interesting offer; he wants Tobey to repair a Ford Shelby Mustang that he wants to sell for up to three million dollars; a quarter of which would go to Tobey. After the work is completed Tobey demonstrates just how fast the car is; this impresses car buyer Julia Maddon but not Dino as he thought he should test drive the car. Dino challenges Tobey to a street race to find out who is really the fastest driver, they are joined by Tobey's friend Pete and race in three Koenigsegg Agera R supercars. Tobey is set to win as Pete is preventing Gino from overtaking, Gino rams him causing the car to flip off the road and explode. Gino leaves the scene leaving Pete to go to jail for involuntary manslaughter.Two years later Tobey is released and wants revenge by beating him in the 'De Leon'; an illegal supercar race where the victor gets to keep all of the cars. If he is to participate he will have to have to get a car, get a race invitation and get to California in under forty eight hours. He gets the car when Julia turns up in the Shelby Mustang. She insists on going with him and they quickly set off with Tobey's friend Benny flying overhead to check on traffic. Along the way they pick up friends Joe and Finn who drive their support vehicle. Just getting to California will be a problem; Dino has offered his rare Lamborghini to anybody who stops Tobey and they also have to stay ahead of the police. There problems are far from over when they get to California.I had heard that this film was a bit rubbish. To be honest that is a bit unfair; sure it isn't going to win any Oscars and the plot is very predictable but when it comes to the action it really delivers. Even if, like me, you aren't a car expert you can see that the cars that feature are something special. The races are exciting and the crashes are spectacular and realistic rather than the CGI enhanced fake action we see in so many films these days. The cast do a solid enough job; notably Aaron Paul as Tobey and Imogen Poots as Julia. Dominic Cooper's Gino is a bit of a pantomime villain but that isn't out of place in a film such as this; similarly Michael Keaton's characters, race organiser 'Monarch' is over-the-top and a bit bizarre but still entertaining. Overall I'd say I enjoyed this far more than I expected; the story might be predictable but the execution kept me gripped from start to finish; I'd certainly recommend it to fans of the genre."
" The movie delivers on expectations
",2017-05-09 00:00:00,7,"Reviewers love to criticize movies, but those trashing it didn't compare the movie to what its aim was. It's a movie representation of a video game series. I think everyone involved in the movie delivered on exactly what they set out to do. Sorry for those who didn't play the video game and had no real idea what to expect. Maybe do a simple web search first and you won't be disappointed.Average acting, predictable story...etc. Those critical are not wrong. However this movie, like the video game series, is about exotic super cars, police chases, and street racing. That's it. The movie had all that and higher quality racing scenes than I expected, CGI didn't appear overused. I knocked off 3 stars because 1) the romance was an unnecessary inclusion and poorly done 2) beginning was drawn out 3) the comedy was unnecessary and pretty cheap."
" WOW, I never expected the story line to be so good
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,"Normally, we are used to boring films like the new Fast and furious where everything ends up in karate, or shootings and it totally forgets that the movie is about cars.But this film was wow, very intense especially for a car fanatic like myself. I could watch this movie a couple of times and still be amazed. The actors played a tremendous role, very impressed. A movie that can make you feel with the movie, and make your tears come out. It's amazing. I hope they come out with a new one soon. And please keep the same story writer, I feel like he deserves an award."
" It's a good movie.
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,8,"I like this movie too much, because that movie makes me feel like a bird. I like Aaron Paul because he have charisma, sense of humor and he is very serious in that movie. The cars are really nice, from my opinion the best car in that movie is koenigsegg agera, but the others are too nice. That movie is the movie what represents me."
" Pathetic
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,2,"Now that message boards are closed, I had to write my first review. Pathetic movie. Aaron Paul is miscast. No story and laughable dialogues. Michael Keaton is the most irritating character followed by Imogen Poots and Scott Mescudi. Dominic Cooper is the only likable character even though he is the bad guy. The most ridiculous scene I ever saw in movies is refueling the car on the move. Cant they stop for 2 minutes to refuel?"
" All you haters...Shut up.
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,9,"I wasn't going to write a review but I feel there needs to be a positive review amongst the many negative ones. Need for Speed is a great movie. Of course it's cheesy, you pricks. It's based on a racing video game! What were you people expecting? I watched this expecting street racing and action, and that's what I got! Not much of a plot, but the small one that exists is a decent one. Not an Oscar winner here. Mostly a fun movie that is fast paced all the way through and never falls off that course. Don't listen to all the hatred going on here. This is an extremely fun and enjoyable flick. Fast expensive cars, hot women, action, comedy, a little drama. What else do you want from a film that's based on a video game? Come on people, lighten up a bit. 9/10"
