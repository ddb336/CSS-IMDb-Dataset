" A must watch for all Batman fans
",2021-04-05 00:00:00,8,"If your a fan of the Batman series or of the joker then you have to watch this film it shows the origin of the most well known villains the joker and is perfect for someone who hasn't read the comic as it stays very true to it if it weren't for the first thirty minutes of this film being a bit of a meh I still think it fits in and is needed for what happens later with batgirl, if the first thirty minutes of this film we're improved I would have definitely given this film nine stars."
" Read the Graphic Novel Instead
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,5,"I am a huge fan of ""The Killing Joke"" comic. I was exited to watch this animated film, but after seeing it... I was disappointed. They added a bunch of unnecessary plot points, and the batman/batgirl thing was just... weird. Read the comic instead."
" The Killing Intro Story
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,3,"I couldn't make it past the intro story. Other reviewers have explained why it exists, but I will explain why it is awful:1) The film doesn't explain the Batgirl/Batman relationship at all. We don't see him train her, we don't see him provide her weapons, we don't see him assign her tasks. We do see him telling her ""no"" repeatedly. And we do get a lame ""yoga instructor"" analogy where she complains about Batman, and says she only sees him because there are no other instructors. But she isn't interested in training, she only wants to fight criminals, so what does she need Batman/yoga instructor for anymore?2) The yoga instructor analogy that is frequently used does not provide us the key component: Does Batgirl have feelings for Batman? She described the relationship as completely platonic but then she initiated sex with him (after an argument where he doesn't allow her to do what she wants lol). Also she shouldn't be talking about Batman to her friends, even as an analogy, and definitely not loudly in a library. Superhero Basics 101.3) She goes after Paris Franz alone, not only against Batman's orders, but in a way where it is completely obvious she is walking into a trap. It makes her look stupid and not worthy of being part of the bat family.4) She sneaks down a hotel hallway then opens a door to a room, and walks in clearly leaving the door open, showing again how stupid of a superhero this version of Barbara is (she didn't want to give away her presence in the hotel). 15 seconds later the door is magically closed and there are bad guys trying to open it (really lazy filmmaking here.)5) The unfeeling ""all hope is lost"" Batman gives in to sex with his ditzy incompetent trainee with no hesitation. Lol yeah right.6) Then we're back to Barbara using the yoga analogy loudly in the library for the third time and I turned it off.If this intro to Barbara was supposed to make me sympathetic to her character, it did the exact opposite. Incompetent as a superhero, no respect for her instructor, and emotionally unstable. Rated 3 for the decent animation and fight sequences."
" It doesn't match the impact of its source material, and in trying to fix issues from its source creates new problems.
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,6,"A week after Babrara Gordon retires as Batgirl following a confrontation with low level gangster Paris Franz. Batman visits Arkham Asylum in the hopes of preventing himself from falling into path he can't return from with his arch nemesis, Joker. Upon learning Joker has escaped yet again Batman sets out to find him. Joker's first stop in his latest spree is the Gordon residence where he shoots Barbara and kidnaps Jim Gordon to prove to Batman everyone is one bad day away from becoming just like him. Interspersed with the events are flashes to the man Joker may have been before.Batman: The Killing Joke is easily one of the most if not most well known Batman stories ever done. Written by Alan Moore in 1988, the story was Moore and company's attempt to dive into the psychology behind the Batman/Joker dynamic and give us a glimpse into the inner pain of the Joker behind the colorful attired and exaggerated grin. The story has influence filmmakers Tim Burton, Christopher Nolan, and Todd Philips in their takes on the character, and also been a reliable staple with references in the Batman Arkham games as well as elements being adapted for usage in the two part season one finale of the 2004 cartoon The Batman. It's an important story to the Batman mythos and was hinted at for years before finally being confirmed in 2015 and released in 2016. It's just a shame that some of the impact is lost in translation.The thing to note about Batman:The Killing Joke is it does deliver what it promises, but only at the 30 minute mark. Prior to that it's a 30 minute prologue unrelated to The Killing Joke following Batman and Batgirl tackling a crime spree by a preening, chauvinist, gangster named Paris Franz. I understand in principle why this prologue exists, but while it addresses one problem it causes others in the process. In the original comic , one of the most memorably shocking and criticized moments from the book was where Joker shoots Barbara Gordon in the spine paralyzing her from the waist down and stripping her nude for the sake of tormenting her father Jim Gordon. It's a fair point of criticism seeing as how it's Barbara's only scene in the comic, and the backstory when the editor approved this scene by saying ""sure, kill the b****"" is certainly a black mark on the story. Alan Moore has even gone on record saying he regrets the decision. With that said, various writers salvaged this moment and helped turned Gordon into Oracle, but that's another story. The Prologue in the movie is clearly an attempt to build up Barbara and create a road where the plot can justify bringing itself to the shocking moment from the Killing Joke, but in the process it damages the relationship between Batgirl and Batman and that Brian Azzarello who adapted the story and created the prologue doesn't understand the relationship. What has been deemed the Bat-Sex scene is just completely false and feels like bad fanfiction than something the two characters would do, and even taking out that sex sequence the prologue feels like it's less about giving Barbara a last hurrah as Batgirl and more about contributing to Batman and his relationship to Batgirl. There's an idea in the prologue but it's buried beneath a myriad of bad decisions that undermines its intended purpose.With that said, the remaining 45 minutes which tell The Killing Joke are reasonably well done. There's no call backs to the prologue and aside from a post credit stinger establishing Gordon becoming Oracle the story is pretty much presented as was told by Moore in comic format with mild brushes on the dialogue and sequencing. The animation does get a bit more stiff in the latter half as they adhere maybe too closely to capturing the look of the comic and don't allow the animation to express as much as they should, but for all intents and purposes it tells the story you expect.Batman: The Killing Joke is a flawed adaptation. Were it just the last 45 minutes this would probably be an 8, but the prologue causes more problems than it fixes."
" Dvd Marathon
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,7,"A cartoon with action, murder, depraved lunatics, and a song break with Mark Hamill?
The Killing Joke is quite possibly my favorite comic of all time. Sam Liu did a fantastic job directing. Animation was true to Batman animation of years past. The epic trio of Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill and Tara Strong delivered per usual.""One bad day can drive a good man to madness"" is something I've often pondered about for a long time and something I will always ponder. It's also something that Joker failed to exploit and prove and it's also something Batman proved to be inaccurate. But...is it inaccurate? The Killing Joke goes beyond just Batman and Joker, beyond comics themselves. The Killing Joke makes you think beyond the surface and any comic that does that is a good comic to me."
" boring
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,5,Can it be anymore boring. What a waste of great actors
" DC at its edgiest
",2021-01-12 00:00:00,3,"DC's animation has always been a bright spot for the brand, allowing extensions of characters and worlds not seen on this big screen. However, it is not always free from the things that hurt them cinematically. DC, at least on-screen, has a tendency to delve into extremely dark places, but unfortunately it more often than not comes across as edginess rather than provocative storytelling. Killing Joke is possibly the worst offender in this regard. The infamous scene in this movie is where Batman and Batgirl have sex, but that's mostly a stupid one-off moment. The dark places that this movie goes to are some of the darkest you'll ever see in comic book media, but nothing is done with it.The worst offender is the scene where the Joker is implied to have raped Barbara Gordon. I can't believe I just typed that. When it comes to movies that handle serious subject matter like that, it is judged by the care that it is handled with and the manner in which it is presented. That's the difference between Schindler's List and The Nutcracker in 3D. Killing Joke takes such a serious subject as rape and turns it into a mere plot point, not a reason for character development or a statement of any kind. We never even see how Barbara was affected by it. This all begs the question; why put that in the movie? It does nothing for the story or for the characters, so it just feels like provocative, attention grabbing edginess.It also has no movies that precede or succeed it, which is normally fine but here the characters act in a way that makes it seem like this is a sequel. Given all the different Batman movies made in the past, we don't know how they got here. The clear tension between Batman and Batgirl is fine as it is, but we have no backstory to base this in. Ironically for something as lore filled as comic books, this bases a lot on lore, although is its own canon. It has two stories in one, but they don't fit together very well. The story with Batgirl and Paris could've been its own thing while Batman and Joker is another.It's not all bad. The best thing is the voice acting, highlighted by the return of actors from Batman: The Animated Series, featuring Mark Hamill returning to play the Joker, as well as Kevin Conroy reprising his role as Batman. Hamill especially is fantastic. Tara Strong (who has a million different roles), plays Batgirl. The animation is solid and feels just like the 90's show. The Joker is given a backstory here, and while it's no Joaquin Phoenix Joker, the flashback sequences were very good. If the movie was just his backstory and the ending, it could've been a much better movie."
" Thought it'll be a lot better
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,6,"I heard a lot about this movie, so I thought i'll give it a try and watched it. Probably my first DC animated movie...
some moments we're cool, and it's pretty short so it doesn't get boring, but it felt uneven and kind of a mess."
" ""Why can't you see the funny side?""
",2020-11-26 00:00:00,6,"I expected a lot more from this animated story, particularly since the graphic novel of the same name by Alan Moore was such a well regarded and popular work. The first part of the picture dealt with Barbara Gordon/Batgirl and her working relationship with Batman, and really didn't have much bearing on the Joker portion of the story. The segue of Batgirl getting frisky with the caped super-hero left me kind of cold, that really has no place in a super-hero movie to my way of thinking. The main story line has The Joker humiliating Commissioner Gordon while attempting to prove to Batman that just about anyone is one bad day away from going crazy. With a blocky art style and cliched dialog, I thought this film could have used a lot of improvement. There's a cringe worthy line uttered by a security guard when he sees Batman for the first time; you have to wonder if he'd been sleeping under a rock when he comes out with - ""It's that human bat-guy""! Almost as cringe worthy as seeing Batman and the Joker yucking it up at the end over a stupid joke. When did that ever happen in the comics?"
" Garbage
",2020-11-20 00:00:00,1,This is awful. Having read the graphic novel and loved it. This has nothing to do with it. It's called the killing joke but it's completely different and extremely boring. One of the worst things I've seen in a long time
" One Bad Joke. Or Maybe Two.
",2020-11-19 00:00:00,2,"This film was supposed to adapt the classic comic where the Joker shoots and paralyzes Barbara Gordon, ending her career as Batgirl and turning her into Oracle.If a comic book, er ""graphic novel"" sounds a bit light for a film, you're right. So they take on a leading 30 minute story that's all about Batgirl and hardly any Batman (and no Joker at all). It's a boring story livened only by the unrealistic sex scene between Batgirl and Batman. Yes, cold, stoic Batman has sex with his protege. Ew.Then the real story begins, which also features not much Batman but lots of backstory on how the Joker was a failed comedian, whose pregnant wife died in an accident, helping two crooks and became the Joker. Here he shoots and paralyzes Barbara Gordon, with strong implications that he then raped her. Double ew. He kidnaps Commissioner Gordon and has his freak show parade him around his amusement park naked to try to drive him insane. He doesn't, Batman shows up, he and the Joker have an existential standoff, and the end.It's just not good."
" A solid entry in the DC animated universe
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,7,"""Batman: The Killing Joke"" is one of the most acclaimed graphic novels of all time, so saying I was excited to viewits animated adaptation would be an understatement. I left my expectations at the door, fired up Netflix, and sat down with my cousin, who fell asleep about 15 minutes into this movie.Full disclosure: I am not the biggest fan of animation; that's not to say I don't enjoy it. Maybe my lack of enthusiasm for animated film is because of my lack of viewing high-quality animation. Luckily, ""Batman: The Killing Joke,"" is, in fact, high-quality. As a fan of compelling drama, intriguing moral dilemmas, and of course, Batman, this movie delivered. To be perfectly honest, this was one of the most thoroughly entertaining animated superhero movies that I have seen, period.Why did I enjoy this movie? For one, while the first third of this film has been met with polarizing reactions, to say the least, I really enjoyed the character building of Batgirl, and the exploration of her relationship with Batman. Sure, some of the dialogue and situations presented were extremely melodramatic, but I can't deny that I found it fascinating. The fact that Batgirl is basically the main character of the first act of this film was also an unexpected twist that consistently held my interest, and I enjoyed watching her interactions with Batman, as well as the criminals of Gotham. Also, the focus on her makes the inevitable incident regarding her and Mr. J all the more impactful.And when Joker presents himself and the focus shifts to Batman, the film picks up in a big way. Batman is already an inherently interesting character, and watching him struggle with his own sense of morality in the face of Joker's psychotic behavior is riveting. Mark Hamill plays Joker to perfection, perfectly encapsulating his madness, as well as demonstrating a more sympathetic side during the film's flashback sequences. On the other hand, and it pains me to say this, I found Batman's voice actor to be lacking. While Mark Hamill sounded like he was relishing his performance, Kevin Conroy, the actor who plays Batman in this film, sounded like he was reading his lines directly off the script. Now, whether this is due to a legitimate lack of enthusiasm on his part, or because the lines simply do not translate from page to screen, is not clear. What is clear, however, is that his performance, while lackluster, is perfectly watchable, and did not detract from my overall enjoyment of the film as a whole.Additionally, I did find the animation to be, as a whole, cheap and bland. There were certain scenes that look absolutely gorgeous, almost as if the graphic novel leapt from the page to the screen. Besides those few sequences, though, the animation did feel unnaturally stiff and under-detailed. This may not be an issue for you, but since this was a major release based off of one of the best graphic novels of all time, I did expect a certain level of polish and detail that this movie did not deliver.""Batman: The Killing Joke"" is a fantastic drama. With a gritty story that explores how much pain a man can take before he abandons his humanity and loses his mind, this more grounded take on a Batman story is sure to satisfy your itch for a dark, yet entertaining, animated superhero film."
" Could Have Gone Without The Prologue
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,6,"Batman: The Killing Joke is one of the major comic events in the Dark Knight's legacy. With its dark story and graphic violence, the one-shot was the most talked about, as it would retire Barbara Gordon as Batgirl and be one of the events where Batman started to get more violent (until Tim Drake took the mantle of Robin). This movie is a lot of firsts: It is the first Batman film to recieve an R rating (and anyone who read or heard of the comic will agree it's the right rating), but sadly, this adaptation, while okay, fails to recreate the shock and infamy the comic had gained.
The prologue and first half of the movie are said to be the worst, as it focuses on Batgirl/Barbara being stalked by the newphew of a mob boss who she failed to capture when they steal an armored car. I get movie adaptations of books tend to add some extra scenes in order to fill out the movie's run time, but this feels a little uneccesary and not well thought out. Basically, what we get is filler where Batgirl gets treated like an object by Paris Franz (what kind of mobster name is that), and even a scene where she has sex with Batman. This part does Batgirl dirty and makes me wish they was either not added or was further worked on.But thankfully, after that disgraceful addition, we finally get to the meat of the movie, as that is where the adaptation begins, and this is where the movie gets better. This adaptation basically stays faithful in this part, as nothing is cut for being too gruesome or graphic. Also, Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamil reprise their roles as Bruce Wayne/Batman and The Joker, making this feel like what would have been if Batman: The Animated Series was more for adults than kids.This is an okay Batman film, but it's far from being as good as the comic it adapts. While it's nice to see Kevin and Mark reprise their roles and the adaption staying faithful, the first twenty eight minutes keeps it from getting a better score from me."
" Good Adaption: don't listen to incels
",2020-10-29 00:00:00,7,"Everyone who gave this a bad review is being an asshat. After the Batgirl prologue (which does a great job establishing Barbara's character and the weight of her connection to Bruce), the following feature is pretty much a shot for shot, word for word adaption of the source material. I'm not joking, a good 80% of the dialogue is ripped straight outta the comic. There are a couple of additions that are welcome as they flesh the story out a bit better, for instance, the scene where Joker holds a mock trial for Gordon. This is all held back by one glaring issue though: the animation really isn't all that flash. It gets the point across and the especially harrowing scenes still carry the weight they're meant to but sometimes faces are just janky as hell. The other downside this brings is that the brilliant colour work of the original comic is lost. Still an enjoyable film though, do recommend."
" Great movie till the end
",2020-10-23 00:00:00,5,"Besides the ending it has two story arcs with the first being about batgirl and her relationship with batman. This kind of transitions to when joker shows up shooting batgirl paralyzing her and then raping her (implied). You would think that is a huge point especially since just a couple of days ago her and batman had sex and how batman left from the hospital with her to go confront joker. But no, that fact that at the end when he finally finishes his fight with joker he stops and says they have had similar trauma and he wants to help him and rehabilitate him. To put a big ol cherry on the top of that joker makes a joke and batman LAUGHS with him......like we just gonna forgot about the fact he has killed countless and just paralyzed batgirl for life and raped her.....really?"
" Good adaption.
",2020-10-20 00:00:00,3,"Unfortunately the comic isn't very good. I could never buy that The Joker was a normal guy, lost his family, fell into chemicals and became crazy for the rest of his life. Classic comic book writing where it makes sense if you don't think about it for one second.The first part of the story... What? I enjoyed it. I thought it was a cool/new story to explore but it had absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the movie. They didn't even bring it back around. Like using the Voice Over that they had established. This was clearly added to make The Killing Joke feature length. They should have made it short or committed to their changes and fleshed out the idea that started."
" Not a cartoon fan
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,7,But this was a good Batman movie. Could not believe who did one of the voices?
" Rip off
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,2,"Such a great movie, with so much potential... and they killed it with the ending.. literally KILLED the entire movie.. it was horrible the way they ended it"
" Great looking adaptation
",2020-07-13 00:00:00,7,"Based on Alan Moore's graphic novel, The Killing Joke was a brilliant animated film with some of the best action sequences in a DC Animated film. But when that's the first thing I can say about the film then it proves that there is something wrong with it. The Killing Joke was bogged down by a 30 minute prologue just to show Barbara Gordon quitting as Batgirl and all the violence and swearing felt like the filmmakers desperately trying to prove how adult their story was. When the film does go into The Killing Joke storyline it was a faithful adaptation of the graphic novel."
" Outstanding
",2020-06-25 00:00:00,9,"Outstanding animated film for any fan of Batman. Commissioner Gordon is a tad bland in line deliveries but other than that, it was an excellent film."
" Ok but not great
",2020-06-23 00:00:00,6,"The original comic story was better, than the movie, but the movie was ok"
" Two stories that don't align together.
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,6,Skip the first part and starts where the comic books starts.
" This movie reeks
",2020-06-11 00:00:00,1,Oh my god this movie sucks. The joker is is not a good character and neither is Batman
" Sad they removed it from the continuity.
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,10,"Great film. It's a pity it didn't get added to new 52 continuity, like the other R rated titles are.Reminds me of Heath Ledger's joker in the whole idea that he tried to get a 'regular' person to go insane like through trauma of loved ones and public humiliation, the same way Joker himself did--but only got proved wrong.
SPOILER
I liked it, because I like more adult themed cartoons and lets face it, Batman and Batgirl hooking up was totally hot. It's not like they did anything explicit but somehow people got hurt feelings or something because of off camera implications. If you read that much into a cartoon themed for adults, then perhaps you should watch some themed for younger audiences. You have the option."
" Poetic Injustice at its Finest Overlooked.
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,5,"A decent interpretation with a questionable introduction. Unfortunately, they fail to get the Joker's 'Killing Joke' from the original! The Joker's triumph in the graphic novel, is that he manages to prove that he and the Dark Knight are of the same kind in the end. He provokes genuine laughter from the toughest audience possible, even though the cruel joke is on them. Poetic injustice at its finest is overlooked."
" Batman: The Wretched Joke
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,3,"For this most part, I think all the DC movies are pretty solid and the Batman ones are often a step above the others. The animation is always excellent and, especially with Batman and Joker, the voice acting is spot on perfect. On a technical level, this is no different.That all likely seems like high praise for a movie I've rated so lowly. The problem is the story. I don't really want to know the origin of the Joker. I don't really like seeing Barbara Gordon turned into little more than a plot device.None of that is great, but what really kills this for me is... Look, I get the Joker is a horrific, nightmare inducing psycho clown villain, but I do not need to see a pretty heavily implied scene of him shooting, paralyzing and the sexually molesting and potentially raping someone. That's just a line I didn't need crossed. Also, Batman does something at the end that I really felt was out of character for him.Batman v Joker is a classic, epic rivalry. A rivalry that makes any story potentially compelling just from their presence alone. It was so disappointing to see this story have such potential only to go way overboard and ruin it completely. That's not even mentioning the mistreatment off basically every character."
" An Ugly Personality Destroys a Pretty Face
",2020-02-26 00:00:00,7,"As a disclaimer, I went into this film completely blind, with my only knowledge knowing that this was based on the short graphic novel. And it's...good. I love most of the Batman movies I've seen and video games I've played, and this film in comparison is just as engaging. Especially the last 10 minutes of the movie had me on the edge of my seat. Some cool action here and interesting character dynamics there, but let me just say this minor spoiler: the rape? The sex? It just doesn't seem right here. The payoff doesn't feel earned, and is in poor taste. I've heard others say the first half hour of the film is completely pointless and you can skip it, and...I would say it does add some depth to the stakes by the climax, but it doesn't tie into the main narrative almost at all. Oh, and FANTASTIC voice acting 💯 listening to Mark Hamil's Joker talk is music to my ears. It's worth a watch either way 🤷‍♂️"
" What?
",2020-02-05 00:00:00,5,"Now, this may seem absurd, due to the fact that I haven't even watched this movie in over 15 minutes, but I had to stop it. But, the reason I had to stop it was because of a certain act Batman and Batgirl had done. I may speak for most people when I say Batman would be more of a father figure to Barbara-Batgirl-so them doing the deed is incredibly repulsing. I wanted to view the movie since I've never been disappointed with a DC Universe film, but that one scene ruined it for me."
" COULD BE BETTER
",2020-01-21 00:00:00,6,"Storyline is a bit different thank comic which is not so bad. Animation quality is not satisfying, especially when we think it has released in 2016."
" I watched the movie and read the comic book back-to-back
",2019-12-20 00:00:00,5,"...and it's like listening to Mozart, and then again - in a concert of a beginners class of six year olds. In case you wonder: the beginners class is the movie.
Everything from the book is there (and more), but it's pretty lifeless. No real tension, no artful animation or even drawing style.
Skip the movie, read the book."
" Batgirl and Joker
",2019-11-18 00:00:00,6,"Barbara Gordon is Batgirl. She tries to help Batman but he decides to keep her off the case. Even after having sex, Batman tries to keep her away. Batman is almost killed and Batgirl almost kills the criminal Franz in anger. Batgirl quits. Batman investigates a murder scene and suspects the Joker. He goes to Arkham Asylum and finds that the Joker had escaped putting a doppelganger in his place. The Joker kidnaps Commissioner Gordon and shoots Barbara.This doesn't start with the Joker. Why? It seems obvious that this should start with the Joker. Instead, it's trying to give depth to Batgirl but not necessarily good depth. I don't like the sex and then quickly drop the sex. She starts as the lead and then becomes coma girl. If she's the lead, she should be the lead for the whole movie. This is fine but it's not anything great."
" A flat joke
",2019-11-09 00:00:00,3,"This is my second viewing of ""Batman: The Killing Joke"". For some reason, I came back to it which I think is due to its depravity. I had a hard day at work where someone was tough to deal with. Sometimes after a day like that, you just want a movie where people are treated as bad as you are.This isn't a brutal movie like advertised. Brutality, I think, implies some degree of craftsmanship. ""Killing Joke"" is just nasty and dumb but memorable in parts if you forget how poor the overall result is.The first half involves Batman and Batgirl chasing a villain who is really named ""Paris Franz."" He's some generic gangster who wouldn't be out of place in any of the batman tv animated shows. He is romantically obsessed with Batgirl which must stir her own sexuality. Since Batman is the only straight man she is regularly around, he is her fantasy. They have sex eventually. The film portrays them having a teacher and student relationship. Batman is never shown to desire her in any way until the sex. Maybe its because he is just a man? A recurring theme of this film is straight men's insatiable desire. Joker goes for hookers every time he escapes Arkham. Batman is usually portrayed as an elevated figure, a super-hero. Batman should stop himself from giving into his base urges but doesn't. He is ""flawed"" in that way. The original comic didn't include this part probably because this segment makes Batman out to be as nasty as the Joker.Joker officially enters the picture after Batman's failed attempt to reconcile in Arkham. He visits Barbara Gordon aka Batgirl and shoots her in the stomach. It is implied that he rapes and tortures her. He kidnaps her father and takes him to a carnival where he is stripped and tortured. Joker wants to show Batman that anyone can be like him with enough psychological abuse. You can infer that Joker is in love with Batman and this whole thing is a big cry for attention. Maybe that's why the film goes out of its way to show how straight each man is.Batman and Joker hash it out and Batman kills him, I guess? To be honest, I didn't care. This Joker staged an entire elaborate plan to elicit a specific response from one man. He is too calculated to be insane with his theory of mentally breaking down Mr. Gordon. Therefore, Batman and Joker are two equally matched men with different approaches. That's it. The obviousness of their duality, at least for me, doesn't justify the treatment of Batgirl. She is just a plot point in the source material. She's even less here even if her pain is occasionally self inflicted. The film repeatedly abuses her when she isn't even the main character. If the film at least committed to her mistreatment, misogynists could enjoy it. Of course she recovers and goes back to crimefighting as much as she can given what happens.The voice acting is good all around and Mark Hamill is especially talented returning as the Joker. His voice fills the room in each scene. Kevin Conroy is authoritative and stiff as Batman. The quality of the animation is not as good. The main characters are animated well. Joker's lackeys often appear cheaply rendered with crudely drawn lines outlining their shapes. It looks as if budget or time constraint was an issue."
" I'm ashamed....
",2019-11-05 00:00:00,4,It's one of my favorite reads but so lazily and poorly adapted into the big screen. The only reason it gets a a higher score then a one is they got Mark to play Joker again.
" Intriguing and Unnerving
",2019-11-01 00:00:00,10,"Read the 1988 novel. How can the movie be any different? It was like being in the dark comic book itself. The one thing that I can add to it that the movie was more unnerving than the original comic book. Batman(Kevin Conroy) and Batgirl(Tara Strong) are working together against a crime ring in Gotham City. It was either Batman & Robin who work together, but the first Robin(Dick Grayson) would later become Nightwing so they are 2 bats in Gotham City. The real unnerving part of the film which was not mentioned in the comic is when moral lines were crossed. Batman and Batgirl getting intimate together was a first for me. I was very taken aback. More unnerving than when the Joker(Mark Hamill) crippled Barbara Gordon.
If you can't follow the Dark Night, then you need a map to know about Gotham. I have had enough of the negative reviews. I enjoyed it very much. It's recommended for the diehards out there. Check out the Killing Joke, whether it's the novel or the movie, then find out which unnerves you the most.
5 stars!"
" No idea if a good adaptation, but bad movie
",2019-10-30 00:00:00,1,"Didn't read the comic, no idea if it is like this movie or not. As a movie, it is boring, and honestly, not disturbing/powerful etc either."
" I LOVED IT but there is a ""but""...
",2019-10-20 00:00:00,9,"I loved it! I thought it was just as brilliant as the graphic novel was. Sure, there are plenty of animated DC movies with better animation but it it didn't hold the story from being good. I know this might be an unpopular opinion but the reason I loved it is because I knew about the disastrous prelude they added and since I already read the comic, I skipped to the good part, to where the story really starts. Just start the movie at 31:04. Do that and I guarantee it becomes a better movie. Plus, it's always fun to hear Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill both having a blast voicing their characters."
" Not the Dark Knight, but not Batman: Bad Blood
",2019-09-26 00:00:00,8,"It seems that most of the people giving this bad reviews on here read the novel and think that every adaptation should be shot-for-shot. This movie is pretty original, and is told in parts, so it feels rather different. With multiple narrators and main characters, it sets itself aside from the typical Animated Series style that most animated Batman movies are nowadays. But I've seen some bad animated movies in this line, like Batman: Bad Blood. A mess of a film. This one has structure, character development, and some straight up SWEET shots and fights."
" Mark Hamill's shines
",2019-07-19 00:00:00,5,"Here's my ( super late ) review of BATMAN:THE KILLING JOKE .The dynamic duo are back ,Mark Hamill returns after all this time to voice the joker and Kevin Conroy as batman. The movie had a lot of hype before its release but did it live up to its hype ? I guess not .The first 30 minutes of the movie is no way related to the plot it just had to be there to waste time and make a television episode look like a movie and the movie got rated R for no reason at all , maybe its just to bring up the hype.I personally hated Batman's costume , his cowl looked like demon ears and his chin and mouth under the mask made him look old and there were no other scenes related to Bruce and the story's focus was more on batgirl even though this story should be about joker's origin . I loved how the joker was animated ,pretty intimidating and that with hamill' s voice was a great combo and the ending was something I never expected ,its a cliffhanger but a good one .The music score was good .not great ,good.In the end if you loved the book you're in for some disappointment but if you're a guy who watched just the Nolan movies then you'll get obsessed with the joker."
" Disappointing!
",2019-07-07 00:00:00,5,"While the additions to the Alan Moore classics are complete rubbish, even the original material misses the mark."
" An Honest Review
",2019-07-06 00:00:00,10,"OK, so I'll admit I was expecting something closer to the graphic novel, and I was pretty disappointed that it only really loosely followed something that was epicly brilliant as the comic.However, I'm not a stickler for total accuracy.And, really it is better than most of the other Batman movies, it does manage to tell a good story and reveal some of the Joker's ever-changing and never consistent backstory, even if it does gloss over a lot of it.In the end, especially in this current era it's a reminder of how great comic books used to be and how great they could be again if they only started telling actual stories once more."
" A waste.
",2019-02-28 00:00:00,3,"This movie is such a waste of time. The comic book 'The Killing Joke' was such a great comic, but it wasn't one to be adapted into a animated film. This movie is so poorly made, with frames of animation going slow making it feel like low frame rate, especially when Batman is walking through the prison to the Joker. This movie is really depressing, showing the origin story for how the Joker went mad, it's a very sad tale, and is not at all fun to watch, and at times uncomfortable. Kevin Conroy is serviceable and does as good as he could've. Mark Hamill is a major standout delivering a performance he's clearly wanted to take on, ironically the only fun part of the movie involves him doing a musical number which is so bizarre and weird that it's fun. Other than Mark Hamill's performance this movie is really bad. Really would've preferred a Mark Hamill audio-book of the comic. The R-rating was a big advertising gimmick for this film, and it is not deserved at all, there's lots of blood and some disturbing imagery in the first 30 minutes, but after that nothing to justify the R-rating. This movie is quite an accurate depiction of the comic, but since the comic isn't long enough to make a feature out of, they add 30+ minutes of Batman and Bat-girl, it's purely in there to make you care about the character of Bat-girl, except you don't because the first 30 minutes is an unnecessary cliche filled side-plot that has nothing to do with the comic and even features a disturbing scene with Batman and Bat-girl towards the end. Did I mention that the Joker is the most fun thing about this movie? That shouldn't be true since Joker should be horrifying. Overall this film is a dark miserable mess, only would recommend to the fans of the comic since after the first 30 minutes it becomes an accurate depiction of the comic, but it's miserable and depressing. To the average Batman fan wanting a fun Batman story, I do not recommend this dumpster fire."
" Good, and yet...
",2019-02-24 00:00:00,7,"Batman warns off his young protege Batgirl for getting too close to and complacent about the case they are involved on. Initially defiant, Batgirl subsequently reacts by having sudden impulsive sex with Batman, then by quitting as Batgirl. The Joker, looking to prove that takes merely a single bad experience to push someone into madness (as evidenced by the tragedy of his own origin), shoots Barbara Gordon (Batgirl) and pralyses, then kidnaps her father Commissioner Gordon and taunts him with pictures of his daughter, naked and damaged. But Gordon does not break, and directs Batman to bring The Joker in by the book.The Alan Moore /Brian Bolland comic on which the latter section of this animated feature is based is a powerful piece of work. Not entirely successful, it is nonethless extremely well written, cleverly scripted, and brilliantly drawn. Some of that shows up in the dialogue, and much of the visuals are clearly based on the comic, but both fall short of the work they come from.Now to the opening section, the key point of which is the abrupt rooftop sexual encounter. From a dramaric point of view, I can see that this was intended to raise the emotional stakes of Barbara's shooting, yet the encounter is left in isolation snd nothing is made of it. This constitures poor writing. The only justification for an unnecessary, out of place sexual act is thrown away, making the act pointless from a storytelling point of view, leaving it seem like unsavoury wish-fulfilment on the part of the filmmakers.This should have been much better than it was."
" A bad adaptation
",2019-01-24 00:00:00,4,"Batman: The Killing Joke is a bad adaptation of an iconic story. It's brought down by the prolonged prologue which is boring, generic and has characters do things that are very out of character and uncomfortable. The prologue also takes up the majority of the run time. By then the last 30 mins, which are actually quite good and faithful to the source material and the great performances from Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy, aren't enough to save it."
" Had problems, however it was good.
",2019-01-21 00:00:00,8,"I understand people hate the first 30 minutes. And yes I hate that too. However the graphic novel comes out in live and is really brilliant to me. Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill did a great job with their roles and for that they deserve my respect. This film deserves an 8 for me. I understand they hate the flaws but usually, I skip the first 30 minutes until its the real film begins. 8/10 good film in my opinion."
" Read the novel.
",2019-01-17 00:00:00,5,I'm a pretty big Batman fan and I have to admit that I like the Joker better when he doesn't have an origin story. Granted I understand the need some fans have for him to have an origin story and the one that is presented in The Killing Joke isn't completely out of the ordinary. I certainly did enjoy the overall story and do love the relationship dynamic between Batman and Batgirl.
" Darkest Batman Movie
",2019-01-17 00:00:00,8,"Yes, this is originally a kids show but this movie is not. Its the darkest batman animated movie you will find there. The animation may have been not good enough compared to other Batman animated movies out there but it was satisfying for me. This timeline of the joker and his past reveals why he is like that. It talks about all kinds of philosophies of the joker and batman. It also has an open interpretation in the end which i clearly loved the most. I love open endings since i got into mature and dark show's."
" the origin of the joker
",2018-11-06 00:00:00,10,"Review: I loved this movie for many reasons. One of the main reasons is it makes a great companion piece to Tim Burton's Batman explaining more detail how Jack becomes the joker. This is truly the closest to a Joker origin story there is. Allan Moore is a very dark comic writer and the staff chose to keep this movie as true to the material as possible. This movie was rated r, I doubt this movie could be made with any lower of a rating. The direction and screenplay are both incredible. Both the casting and acting are both incredible also. Especially by Mark Hamill as the joker. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars."
" 7.2 - A Half-decent Classic.
",2018-11-01 00:00:00,7,"Minor spoilers ahead.Please note: I have NOT read the comic yet. I'm dying to, though.
I give this film an 8/10 for the story and a 6.5 for the presentation and filmography. Overall: 7.2/10.
Kevin Conroy had an excellent voice for Batman; ""(to Barbara) This is still a game to you. This is still a thrill. You haven't been taken to the edge yet... the abyss; the place where you don't care anymore. Where all hope dies."" Beautiful. Mark Hamill's voice for Joker was superb for the character; ""If we deny (memories) we deny reason itself. Although, what's wrong with that, really? It's not like we're contractually tied down to rationality. There is no sanity clause."" The same can be said for Tara Strong's Barbara Gordon voice. Just perfect for the role.
The theme that Joker tries to express is, essentially, that there is no particular purpose for life--or, none that anyone focuses on. Joker asks rhetorically ""do you know how many times we have come close to World War Three over a flock of geese on a computer screen (perhaps referencing politicians, etc.)? Everything anybody's ever valued or struggled for: it's monstrous!""From my Christian perspective, this is the core issue of secular humanism: no one has any absolutely reliable foundation for truth; decency is subject to relativism. People tend to only care for themselves. Unless we have a purpose (beyond ourselves) to serve, we cannot be certain that we are working for a truly 'good' cause; this term 'good' is defined only by common, corruptible human emotions and living on this biased scale only points out one conclusion; we may as well ""go looney"" unless a scale of right and wrong is outside of our hands (i.e. from God).Regarding the film itself, not too bad a movie. Buy it; it's a classic. Batman: The Dark Knight Returns is also good. I often rewatch Batman: The Killing Joke and I'd respect anybody's scores between 6 and 8.
For those who are displeased by this film, remember that Joker said himself in this movie that ""It doesn't have to be good to be a classic""."
" Changes Made for no Reason Other than to make Changes
",2018-08-27 00:00:00,2,"A huge disappointment. Batman and Batgirl having sex is extremely inappropriate for their characters. The characters feel like fanfiction versions of themselves, instead of being true representations.

" A Complete Missed Opportunity
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,1,"This Film has dissapointed me and angered me in ways that few movies have, the first third of the film is one of the most horribly written films i have ever seen, and the other two thirds are almost a carbon copy of the comic its based on. This film is not worth watching. This film hurts me more than any other Batman film. The way they have written Barbara Gordon is so disrespectful, and this prologue has absolutely no impact on the story itself. Don't waste your time, watch Under The Red Hood instead."
" Disappointing.
",2018-07-16 00:00:00,5,"For once I read the source material before seeing the movie adaption. It left me with a feeling of disappointment I normally don't get when watching WB animated movies and especially the ones with Batman. The graphic novel was amazing in its cruel and non-compromising nature thanks to how it deals with the most famous and twisted villain of the Batman universe, the Joker, and how he came to be. Therefore I had high expectations. Well, we still get great performances from both Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy, but here is my biggest problem, they literally retell the story with nothing added to it. Aside from the completely unnecessary backstory of Barbara Gordon which is tedious to sit through, it could just have been a reading done by the voice actors. The animation was lazy, and it looked awful when there was once in a while thrown in some 3D. I don't know, maybe I'm being too harsh on it, because aside from the backstory-thing, it was a faithful retelling. It just seemed bland, and since it is an adaption of an intense and disturbing graphic novel I just expected more than the rough drafts of potentially the greatest Batman movie ever."

" A Tale of Two Halves.
",2018-06-12 00:00:00,6,"To celebrate its DVD release, there was a special one-night theater showing of Batman: The Killing Joke with a brief talk with Mark Hamill beforehand. This is an R-rated animated film with the best of the best lending their voices with Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill voicing Batman and The Joker respectively. Well, that's what the movie should focus on right? First you have watch the Batgirl filled first half to get there. Actually, before I start getting too critical it's vital to know how the plot develops. Batgirl and Batman have a couple bickering matches (that's not entirely true-- Batgirl does the arguing and Batman will wait and then say one line that signals the end of the conversation) about Batgirl's role in some of the crimes and investigations being tackled. And this fills the first half of the 76 minute film. Then it switches between the present with how The Joker alters the Gordon's lives (and ultimately how Batgirl becomes Oracle) and the past of how The Joker came to be.We'll take this on half by half. When you think of animated films, you'll think of in-your-face messages (unless you're thinking of Pixar of course) told by huggable and adorable characters. But when it's rated R, you totally change the target audience and the way to present your art to them. Subtle references will be picked up and understood and appreciated, and overall the small details will add to the big picture. That's really not how this film starts off. Quickly, Batgirl is in conflict with Batman because she thinks he's being too protective of her by not allowing her to pursue a villain. And Barbara Gordon relates her problems to her gay best friend by saying she is sort of seeing her yoga instructor but that they aren't really together. To top off this very strangely presented sexual tension that is served with humor that just doesn't really make the cut, the writers have to make sure the audience is on the same page. When Barbara leaves the library she works at, she listens in to a couple where a guy complains to his girlfriend that she's being too clingy. It's moments like these that make me cringe at how directly an outside situation relates to one of the main characters. The dialogue and presentation is sloppy-- only slightly being balanced by Batman yelling his cool phrases ""Where is he??"" and ""I'm going to ask you nicely only one more time."" Don't lie, guys, you know you read those quotes in your deep, dark, handsome voices. It should also be of note that I watched this film with Amir Kaskas. This otherwise forgettable guy was useful because he has already read the comic and was able to inform me of how this first half introduction wasn't in the comic. I guess I understand why they chose the route because of what happens with Barbara halfway through, but it just didn't generate the development and conflict it hoped to. This movie gets substantially better in the second half. Although I do feel some of facial structures looked weird at moments, the animation (and this applies to the first half in general as well) is superb. And it provides the most depth ever for Mark Hamill to stretch his laughing chords.Although still a bit too direct, the writing is some of the best. The Joker gets some great monologues, Batman has cooler lines, and the messages play out so much better. Trying to show there's craziness in all of us, The Joker formulates an ultimately disturbing plan that tests the body physically and psychologically. And as he does so, the story correlates to an average guy trying to build a family and how his day just continues to get worse. No, it isn't done with subtlety, but its execution excuses for this. The problem I will say is with the second half is ironically the story and presentation. I can't confirm that the comic works it out better, but I presume it does. And I can presume so for a huge reason. I just praised The Joker for some monologues he gets; however, with this as an animated movie, the filmmakers hesitate to add pauses or include more lingering shots. There has to be a flow in everything that is done, so you can't stay in one spot. Because of this, there's not as much impact in the moment of the scene, instead it relies more on the audience recalling it in hindsight. That is where the comic would come in handy; you could stay on a page forever or flip back quickly if you think you recalled something. There's really only one moment in this film where this lingering happens, and that's the final scene going into the credits. People around us were muttering ""Wait, is that it?"" ""Is it really over?"" It's an ending to either like or dislike, no middle ground. To me it was a special moment that worked prominently and is more of the subtlety I wanted to be presented throughout. All in all, it's a special screening that could have had more arguments to see it for the one night instead of just buying the DVD, but when you include a crowd that wasn't all too pleasant to watch with, the DVD probably would've just been better. You will have to endure the first half, and although the second half isn't perfect, it is still a quality watch. If you haven't seen an animated Batman film, they have a distinct style that are interesting to watch, and personally from what I've seen, Batman: Under the Red Hood is what I would recommend watching.Okay, the movie included a bad joke, so I have to follow suit. Actually, this isn't so much a bad joke as it is just a short, black joke. Okay, so I was walking down the street, and I ran into Kevin Hart.

" Joker's wild
",2018-04-16 00:00:00,4,"Batman: The Killing Joke is adapted from the Alan Moore graphic comic.The animation is dark with some bone crunching violence, this is a cartoon not aimed at kids as it examines the violent psyche of the loony Joker (Mark Hamill) but also shows the character in more normal times in flashback.Batman (Kevin Conroy) plays second fiddle here as he tries to look for alternative ways to deal with the clown prince of crime who has escaped from the asylum again. The trouble is the film relegates Batman as a second fiddle to Batgirl who appears for the opening part of the film and tells of her relationship with Batman.This is one of these DVD releases that would go straight to pay television. It still comes across as being rather quickly and cheaply made. Hamill provides a good vocal performance."
" What a waste...
",2018-04-08 00:00:00,3,"Prime source material and this is the result? It's watered down, incoherent and lacks direction. I'm saddened by the fact that this is the result of the cinematic adaptation of this groundbreaking novel."
" Mostly works when doing its source-material almost verbatim, but unfortunately takes some strange liberties.
",2018-03-29 00:00:00,5,"The long-awaited animated adaptation of Alan Moore's acclaimed graphic novel broke new ground in a few exciting new ways, not the least of which being that it was to be the first ever Batman theatrical release to hold an 'R' rating. All the signs pointed towards 'The Killing Joke (2016)' doing its seemingly 'sacred' source material some sort of justice. Sadly, though, the film fails to deliver on its implied promise despite solid performances from the definitive Dark Knight, Kevin Conroy, and the conclusive Clown Prince of Crime, Mark Hamill, as well as its interestingly dark story done more or less beat-for-beat as the original, except from its unnecessary and generic 28-minute prelude. It's this odd addition which ruins the piece's pacing, provides a few uncomfortable moments and paves the way for an ultimately dull first half right from the poorly-drawn first frame (animation issues persist throughout the generally rough-looking picture). When it does the comic-book verbatim, it pretty much works, but when it doesn't, it's almost like a bad joke. 5/10"
" Maybe the hype was just too high?
",2018-03-04 00:00:00,6,"I really don't mind the concept of starting off with a new Batgirl story, but it was not well executed and did not even portray Batgirl very well. The rest is a solid adaptation, but it still feels like it's missing something. Not sure why it got an R rating, either, it was pretty much PG-13"
" Hopefully this gets better or change Directors
",2018-03-02 00:00:00,3,Didn't cost me money and still felt like I was cheated. Batgirl was only interesting part of story which sets her up for follow-on storyline. Script and direction was a SHAM. Ending was pitiful. Only gave it these many stars because fight scenes were acceptable but obviously below average.
" It was good... and then it wasn't.
",2018-02-18 00:00:00,5,"I first decided to start the film from after the half hour mark (which is where the comic starts), simply because I was essentially only interested in seeing what I'd already read be brought to life through animation, voice-work and music. Other than effective moments from the comic being rendered ineffective through the art being at times disappointingly lacklustre and the dialogue being paced in a way that didn't sit comfortably with me, I still would have given the experience a good 7... but then I went back and watched the first half hour, bringing that 7 right down to an average 5.The first half hour did not help the story at all, rather, it ruined it; particularly through, as an attempt at ""fleshing out interest and empowerment"", sexualising the one character who was *not supposed to be sexualised*, especially not in *this* story. I'd still watch the film again if I ever wanted a recap of the story, but I will *always* skip the first half hour."

" Basic panel by panel retelling of the comic with an unnecessary backstory from batgirl
",2017-11-29 00:00:00,6,"The second part of this movie is straight up right out of the comic, not even any real changes to the story, which in itself was kind of disappointing but not that big a deal. The problem lies with part one which deals with a story to empower Barbera and add a sort of weird sexual relationship between Bruce and Barbera, while showing her take out a badguy by herself. It I guess was to make her untimely assault and rape by the joker that more devastating, but in reality it didn't make the movie any better or have a real impact. For those wondering, does this fit with Batman the Animated Series given the stylistic choices the artists chose, Surprisingly Yes if... and only if, you don't factor in the rest of the DC animated universe, the events of what happen directly conflict with Barbera's appearance in Batman Beyond, and the events of Return of the Joker.Anyway I can't really recommend this unless you are a hardcore batfan who needs to see all the batmerchandise."
" Ignore the first half of the movie
",2017-10-29 00:00:00,5,If you ignore the first part of you will be doing your self a big favour because I don't know why but it just focuses on Batgirls relationship with BATMAN! her RELATIONSHIP WITH BATMAN. Barbra is like 16-19 in this movie and Bruce is like in his 30's-40's. Guess what happens? Answer: they have SEX with each other on top of a rooftop. Like what the hell was Timm thinking it is just plain disgusting and disturbing. How a great DC Animated creator like him put this in his movie. The rest of the first half of the movie was just bad because the villain Paris falls in love with Batgirl.My recommendation skip the first part of the movie if you are here to see The Killing Joke movie and not some 36 years old man making out with his son's girlfriend. Trust me you will be doing your self a big favour.
" The prologue is long and unnecessary, latter half is very good.
",2017-08-10 00:00:00,7,"This feature length animated film is an adaptation of the best-selling graphic novel, ""The Killing Joke."" The book was ground-breaking in presenting the origins and background of the most popular supervillain of all time, The Joker. The book's hard-edged approach to storytelling and the depiction of the characters, was something new to fans of Batman comic book readers. The above film aimed to capture all of this and did a pretty good job. The opening scenes about Batgirl are completely irrelevant and too long. The dialogue is rather glib and moronic to say the least. The writers should have created a prologue showing a typically evil criminal act committed by the Joker. It takes 30 minutes before the proper storyline begins and the whole thing is only on for 73 minutes. However, after 30 minutes have elapsed, the film improves a good deal. Batman pays the Joker a visit at Arkham Asylum in order to discover what makes the Joker tick. A series of flashbacks unfold as we the fans come to understand how the Clown of Crime came to become the way he is. The scenes involving Commissioner Gordon and his daughter are quite disturbing and shouldn't be seen by viewers under the age of about 17. That goes for this film in general as the violence is rather more graphic than usual. It was ideal to have Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill reprise their respective characters once again. Who else is going to be associated with these characters in animated form? Thanks to this film, Batman and the Joker come to respect each other in a rather twisted kind of way. It is a deadly scenario of ""cat and mouse"" between the two of them. The two actors deliver the goods and they are the ones worth remembering. The tone is rather a grim one but ""The Killing Joke"" had to be made that way in order to do the graphic novel justice. I enjoyed the scenes based at the deserted fairground in Gotham City. The setting is a natural habitat for the Joker. Commissioner Gordon in his being tortured, added some drama to the proceedings. The animation is excellent and Batman and the Joker are illustrated superbly. To enjoy this film, forget about the prologue and focus on the remaining 40 minutes or more."
" The best adaptation of an okay comic
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,10,"What an astonishing movie, especially the first half is fun and entertaining. While the original story by Alan Moore turned Barbara Gordon into a mere plot device (after Mister Moore was told to ""cripple"" her by some immature consecutive named Len Wein), this movie actually goes deeper and makes matters personal, as Batman finally has a reason to hunt the Joker down and stop the maniacal, sadistic and murderous ""Clown Prince of Crime"" for good...something the Dark Knight has failed to accomplish in all those years, despite having had endless chances and opportunities to do so. Bruce and Barbara have a friendship which goes beyond what the comic canon had established on New Earth/Earth-1 (the main universe in which most of the Batman stories take place). It is for that added romance and backstory which turns a simple retelling of a comic into a television masterpiece. A backstory was necessary, as the viewer had not seen Batgirl in the DC Animated Movie Universe yet, except for a small cameo at the end of some animated movie, and that was the New 52 Burnside- Batgirl, not the more well known one with the yellow and black outfit, so it was very kind of Brian Azzarello and Bruce Timm to add half an hour of pure greatness.It is sad how so many butthurt people crap on a wonderful movie, just because two FICTIONAL adults had sex once. Those people should be ashamed of themselves and consider living in a church for the rest of their lives."
" A good movie but unbalanced.
",2017-07-19 00:00:00,7,"High points of the movie:The animation and graphics are unique and very interesting. There were certain parts during the movie, especially with the close-ups of the Joker, that really highlight and accentuate eyes and facial features. Everything else is animated sleekly and everything looks almost realistic but with a bit of an animated twist to it.I thought the backstory with the Joker was very interesting. I haven't read any of the comics or graphic novels, so my knowledge of Batman and the Joker is very limited. It was good to see that Joker, whatever his real name is, was a compassionate human being before his accident. I also found it compelling that Batman was there when the Joker made his transition from good to evil.Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill return to provide their voices for their respective roles of Batman and the Joker. It was very refreshing to hear Conroy and Hamill return after watching so many adaptations with other voice actors providing their voices for the two iconic characters.Low points:The movie is very unbalanced. From what I have read from other reviewers, the graphic novel really wasn't long enough to be turned into a feature-length film, so Brian Azzarello, the screenplay writer, wrote in an extra twenty minutes at the beginning. While the extra material in the film is not entirely bad, one can definitely comprehend the differences even if they haven't read the graphic novel.The unnecessary sex scene. Now, it cuts away before it really gets shown, but I felt that it was extremely unnecessary. Again, this wasn't in the original from what I researched, but that's not the reason why it bothered me. It bothered because it was very uncharacteristic of Batman to do it.Overall:Not a bad movie. It's definitely worth your time. If you have read the graphic novel, your opinion of the movie can go one of three ways. One, you hate it because it's a bit different. Two, you take it for what it is and accept the changes. Three, you love it. I am somewhere in the middle. I give this movie a seven out of ten stars."
" great movie
",2017-07-04 00:00:00,9,"great movie...don't believe any of the negative reviews on here...all the one's crying about this movie don't have any idea what a good movie is. This movie has all you could ask for, a great story line, great animation and a Batman that we all know and love and once again to the one's crying go and find something to complain about."
" Fails to impress
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,5,"Batman: The Killing Joke fails both its source material as well as a general movie. It doesn't understand what made the original story so good. It doesn't understand the character of Barbara Gordon a.k.a. Bat girl. Its technical aspects leave a lot to be desired. And it doesn't even know how pacing works.But first, let's go over the upsides. It is genuinely pleasing to hear both Mark Hamill as well as Kevin Conroy reprise their roles as Joker and Batman, respectively. Tara Strong as Barbara is also something I will never complain about. The story is not half bad when it is actually about The Killing Joke, especially about Joker's supposed past. And even the animation, cheap though as it looks, can be forgiven when you remember that this was made direct to video on a shoestring budget.Then the problems. They needed to pad out the story. This I can somewhat understand because the original story isn't that long. Making that padding about Barbara is also understandable because the original story has her in a large part and she's the least known out of the principal characters. But did they really have to give her a gay best friend? Did they really have to make the entire first half of the film revolve around her teenage angst because Bruce doesn't luv luv her? I mean, here I thought superhero stories could be about man's struggle with his inner demons reflected on the horrors of the real world. About symbolic battle between shades of light and dark. About discrimination, racism, oppression, difficulties of morality in a world where nothing is truly black or white. But no, apparently superhero stories are just sitcoms where people dress funny.Furthermore, The Killing Joke, the original comic, was such a big thing because it was one of the first stories to really explore the possibility of Joker having a past. Plus it challenged the status quo. Things changed because of it, characters evolved. And this film simply cannot deliver that. Joker's backstory has already been suggested millions of times, there is no status quo to be broken and even the shock value of Joker doing such brutal things that they seem out of character even for him doesn't have much impact because we've seen worse from him. In a movie called The Dark Knight. One of the greatest movies ever made. Perhaps you've heard of it.To add insult to injury, the movie doesn't even earn its R rating. It's a marketing ploy. I've seen movies from the 80s rated PG-13 that have more gore, violence and sexual content than this has.And yet this film is not the worst. Not even the worst animated Batman film. The voice acting is strong, the original story is good, borderline great, and the animation has some good moments. Even its flaws are merely annoying. Not something I'd recommend, but it's watchable."
" Good Adaptation, But Not As Good As The Original Comic
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,8,"Based on the one-shot comic book of the same title from the late 1980s, ""Batman: The Killing Joke"" is a disturbing story that deals with four main issues: Joker's vicious assault on Batgirl; Batman's uneasy alliance/relationship with Batgirl; Joker's origin story; and Batman's perverse affinity for The Joker.After an unnecessarily lengthy intro of Batgirl's/Batman's relationship which doesn't truly mesh with the second and third acts (said intro not part of the comic book, as far as I can remember), ""Killing Joke"" gets to the meat of the story, when The Joker attacks Batgirl and kidnaps her father, who is Police Commissioner Gordon. Batman goes on a rampage, going after every criminal he comes upon to get evidence of where The Joker is. But when Batman finally finds The Joker, will it be too late? Will The Joker bring out the madness in Commissioner Gordon? Will Batman finally succumb to his own rage and kill The Joker?My most memorable, movie moment of ""Batman: The Killing Joke"" is **SPOILER ALERT** the scene when Batgirl, not in costume, opens her apt. door expecting a friend and instead sees The Joker pointing a gun to her stomach.Fans of the source material — I'm one — will most likely not find this adaptation as satisfying as the original. The comic was less than 48 pages if my memory serves me correctly, and in those few pages it packed one hell of a story that was well-paced and intense. This movie, by expanding a short story into near-feature length, adds scenes and sequences that slow the movie down. Yes, the extra stuff adds backstory which yields greater understanding of the main characters; but the pacing and high intensity are sacrificed.Although far from being great, ""Batman: The Killing Joke"" is a good movie; and Mark Hamill's performance as The Joker is outstanding, as usual.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
" Proving a Point
",2017-05-26 00:00:00,7,"Batman and Batgirl doing the nasty. Remember in Batman Beyond Barbara admits to Terry Mcginnis that she dated Batman (Bruce Wayne). Then she quit as Batgirl. This movie delved into that idea. Well a third of the movie was dedicated to that before they actually dove into the killing joke which apparently was taken frame for frame from the comic book of the same name. I did not read it or any batman comic at all but maybe that is why there is a big difference in peoples opinions. It is between those who read the comic and those who did not. The first third has no tie in with the rest of the film except for showing the end of everything. With Robin gone the only other partner of Batman left was Batgirl. Also the villain they were taking on gets obsessed with Batgirl just like the Joker with Batman. After some time passes Joker escapes from the asylum. Flashbacks showing how Joker got into crime emerges right about now i.e. Joker origins. All that while Joker shoots Batgirl, crippling her in the process and kidnaps officer Gordon apparently trying to prove a point. What follows is a musical number by the Joker. The hood worn by the red hood was really constricting how did he think he was going to manage with it? We get what we wanted anyway the origins of Joker. The best part of the movie is undeniably the ending. The Joker made a valid point and Batman provides a counter point. This was an ultimatum but Batman says that it does not have to be this way and even offers to help the Joker. The Joker then tells the killing joke and what Batman does while laughing is open for interpretation as it ended ambiguously. This conversation showed depth in both characters. We then cut to Barbara during the credits and with her actions here perhaps there is a continuation of this story in the future"
" I love the Joker
",2017-05-22 00:00:00,9,"If your a Batman fan, you probably love the Joker, and if your a major Batman fan who likes to read the comics, you probably like The Killing Joke. For those who somehow don't know The Killing Joke is a comic storyline that centers around or favorite clown prince of crime doing what he does best, messing with Batman and anyone who works with him. This comic has been praised for making Joker doing one of the most sadistic things he's ever done. First he cripples Barbra Gordon aka Batgirl, strips her and takes nudies of her. He then kidnaps Commissioner Gordon, strips him, makes him look at his own daughter naked and injured surrounded by freaks that you would see in a circus (obviously). The entire time Joker is trying to break Commissioner Gordon into killing Batman. Obviously Batman stops him. Before he's arrested Batman tells Joker he wants to help him, and Joker refuses saying that he's to far gone. He then tells a joke that's basically a way of him explaining how him and Batman are the same but different. Batman understanding what he's saying, laughs with the Joker, showing one of the most intimate and almost friendly times we've seen Batman be with one of his enemies. The movie takes this amazing comic and brings it into animated beauty that DC does. While it does add things such as the Barbra Gordon X Bruce Wayne sex scene which I would say I didn't enjoy, it's still amazing and should be watched, but knowing some of you who know of The Killing Joke, you've probably already seen it."
" Not even TV-quality
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,4,"I do not understand how someone can justify giving this movie a theatrical release. It is more like a couple of episodes from a Saturday morning cartoon than it is a movie.It starts with a hardly related subplot that serves little purpose but to weaken Batgirl as a character and show us that Batman is Batman. It is almost like those movie releases on VHS where they obviously just put some episodes from a show together to form a movie.Once the story with the joker begins, the movie gets a bit better, at least partly due to Hamill's performance. There are some interesting moments, but even this part of the film feels like a low budget replacement. And the visual style does not fit the story at all. It's like they read the source material and decided to make a 90s animated show about it, only less pretty."
" Mark Hamill Returns As The Voice Of The Joker..
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"WARGING POSSIBLE SPOILERS:OS= The Best DC Batman Animated Solo Films Since Batman Assault On ArkhemPros = 1. Finally get to see Jokers Full Origins in animated form. And in my opinion it's one of the best yet including the 1989 Batman movie version, I won't Spoil anything but in this version Joker starts out relatable and later on when, when he finally become The Joker 2. you get why he went insane, hope that not too much of a Spoiler for you. If it is Sorry. Almost feels like Two DC Animate movies in One. Excellent Action Pack First Half of film.3. They used very clever ways to cover up all of the explicit nudity and sexual content for the film, that's good considering that it clams to be a PG Film, but to me it's still targeted at the Young Adults to the more Mature Audience crowd. But more on that A little latter. 4. Mark Hamill Returns to voice The Joker. Something he hasn't done in years, even with him playing the part of The Trickster on the CW Show The Flash although he still does a good job don't get me wrong, but the part that fits him the most is voicing The Joker in my opinion. Aside from Luck Skywalker that is of course. 5. This movie not only tells the Origins of The Joker but it also tells the Origins of another Batman character, I won't tell who it is your going have to watch and find out for yourselves. And besides I don't want to Spoil anything for you, it's that big of a surprise. 6. The Jokers Flashbacks feels like an extension of the brief Flashback involving Jack being The original Red Hood in another DC animated movie, Batman Under The Red Hood. But with a slight adjustment but at it's core is that extension that I'm talking about. 7. I'm not sure if it's Mark Hamill or what but something about this makes it one of the best betrayals of The Joker in animated form.8. Hare's a little something that I like to mention. Not only that I think it's my favorite line in the film. Loved that line ""All it takes is one bad day just one bad day."".9. As I have mentioned earlier. This Film feels like two DC Animated movies in one the first is mainly Batgirl centered, and the second part is mainly Joker centered, again I don't want to Spoil too much. 10. The Climax and the Ending and the Mid Credits all are pretty surprising. And once again you're going have to watch it for yourselves. And while we're on the subject let me give you some little for you to lick your chops to entice you go and watch and see for yourselves nothing too Spoil ally of course. But let's just say the Mid Credit Scene holds a Special little Easter Egg for the fans familiar with the Batman Comics. And that all that I could say without Spoilers. 11. The movie is not too much Action Heavy, instead it has this perfect Balance between Action, and Story and Character and Plot, and Character Development and Arc and so on. Cons = But like with all DC Animated Movies this is not a perfect movie,  And oh keep in mind that these are ONLY little nip picks. 1. As a package as a whole it only has 2 Animated Bonus Cartoons From The Vault, still very good mind you I just wish there was more of those, those are the Special Features that I look forwards the most. 2. And while we're on the Subject I found that the Special Features lacks in the meat department but also there are at least three or four that I have counted that are Obsolete 'Sneak Peeks'. And those are just the Non-Spoiler one that I could give you. But the good news is that here isn't a lot. As I have said just little Nip Picks that I have.HIT and/or MISS=And finally I'm not sure where to Categorize this last one so that is why I'm Categorizing it in this Category (Hit/Miss). 1. This DC Animated Movie maybe Rated PG but it is still Catered to a Mature Audience, but I already mention that all ready, the reason that I'm mentioning it again is because I just want to make sure that you understand what the targeted audiences is before you show this to your younger ones (The Kids) Under the age I say age 13 or 14 depending on the Maturity of their minds. Despite its PG Rating (For The Reasons Why Go To The PARENTS GUIDE FOR.) Page On this Site for this Movie.CS= Overall this DC Animated movie is defiantly WORTH picking up...."
" One of DC's worst blunders.
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,4,"This movie is awful. As a stand alone movie, it's weak and ineffective. As an adaptation, it's a travesty. What should be a deep, poignant movie that reflects on the nature of good and evil, why we become what we become, whether free will exists and other fascinating themes, becomes a lame action movie full of fan service, bad writing, bad characterization and terrible pacing. This movie is doomed by a complete misunderstanding of what made the comic great, a bad writer and total lack of respect for its characters (especially Barbara Gordon). Everything great about the comic was done poorly or taken out. And all the additions are awful. A fan of the comic will hate it and a newcomer will just wonder why the hell the comic is considered a masterpiece, if this is the story people raved about for 30 years.Animation is decent and voice acting is good, so I gave it a 4/10 out of respect for those things. But this one of the worst things ever produced by DC."
" They wasted good material and awesome actors...on this?
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,3,"I was a fan of the graphic novel, so I will admit that already set a high bar to please me. I would never have considered watching it but for the voice talents of Hamill and Conroy. So I got comfortable and watched, hoping to be 'disturbed.' I was...but not in the manner which I had been expecting. It was FLAT. Like a soda you enjoy left open in a warm room allowed to lose every bubble of carbonation as well as achieve a temperature of lukewarm tepid. My mind wished I could somehow spit it out now. But no... It is there now. Any fond memories of the graphic novel...gone. Replaced with this.Keeping this ""spoiler free"" was extraordinarily easy as it is already a spoiled mire of good talent and incredible source material wasted."
" Intense action-animated feature
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,8,"Batman: The Killing Joke is an intense animated feature reminiscent of older times, when superheroes were only cartoons on screen. I enjoyed the animation of this film, and the plot was full of action and generally enjoyable to watch.I found the film erred on the side of misogyny and over-sexualized Batgirl, but at the same time, if you look at the flip side of the coin, she is still a strong female character despite her hyper-sexuality. It is an unfortunate truth of most female comic strip characters, so we can just be thankful that she isn't a weak female protagonist. Although I didn't appreciate her being hysterical over her rocky relationship with Batman - that was an atypical response that was somewhat frustrating. The Joker is excellent in this feature. He's absolutely insane all the way through to the end. We get a glimpse into his backstory, which makes you feel some empathy for him and his descent into madness. Once again, you see the parallels between the Joker and Batman - they are both isolated and violent characters on opposite sides of the same coin. Besides some minor setbacks, I quite enjoyed this animated feature. Be forewarned: although it's a cartoon, it is quite violent and disturbing. View at your own discretion."
" It should have been the best Batman movie...
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,6,"I have to admit, I was a little disappointed in this one. Which is frustrating, because as a whole it was actually pretty good, but there were some problems that really should not have been there. The Killing Joke is my all-time favorite graphic novel. I have read and re-read it dozens of times, so when I heard DC was making a Killing Joke movie, I was ecstatic. When I heard they got Kevin Conroy (the one true Batman) and Mark Hamill (the best Joker ever) for it? I literally ran around squeeing with joy-- and I'm a grown man. When I caught wind of the special, one-night-only event to see it in theaters? I pulled out my wallet and got tickets, because my favorite Batman thing ever was going to be a movie. It's never fair to expect perfection of a movie adaptation, so I let myself go along for the ride as it started with a Batgirl story. I nodded, thinking ""Cool, this'll set up the Killing Joke stuff that happens with her to have more emotional weight."" And it should have, but then it went in a direction I still feel very uncomfortable with every time I think about it-- spoiler: Batman and Batgirl have sex. Okaaaaayyyy.... Yeah, no, that should only happen in the context of Dick Grayson being Batman when Bruce has disappeared. There is an uncomfortably large age gap, it's not true to the characters, and it's just weird. Even though the story keeps showing us Barbara wanting it, it's still not right because of everything about who they are as characters. Then, after that... interesting... encounter, we move into the actual Killing Joke turf. I will say that section was well-adapted and definitely worth watching. But another complaint about this movie is that the art quality was very inconsistent, and often was downright bad. Did I expect it to look exactly like the graphic novel? No. But did I want it to be at least on the higher-quality end of the scale for DC animated movies? Of course I did, and it was probably the worst looking one to date."
