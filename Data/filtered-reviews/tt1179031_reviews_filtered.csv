" Decent first half
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,3,"This movie seemed like a solid, low budget film in the first half but it seems to me the writers just gave up on a realistic story and made it seem as unrealistic as possible. Only pro of a movie is that there is solid enough acting"
" A great film that keeps giving
",2021-01-22 00:00:00,9,"You don't get many films like this, they are as rare as hens teeth. You think you are being lead one way only to be sent in a more mouth dropping direction. Brilliant acting, there is great interaction from all the cast. Dialogue is on point, the score is simplistic but highly effective. I cannot heap enough praise on all concerned.
Only negative is the runtime, at an hour and fifty it might push the fidgeters."
" such a good movie
",2020-11-24 00:00:00,8,Unexpected surprises in this one. why was it so low key? great acting especially sam shepherd. oh so good. watch it it is so worth it.
" Soid Thriller With Great Twists
",2020-10-21 00:00:00,8,"This is one you don't want to read much about before you see it, but it's campy, pulpy southern fried goodness from start to finish. The synth score is especially awesome. It's not going to change your life and open your eyes to a magical new way of living and restore your faith in humanity, but it's great to kick back with on the couch with a beer or two and have a good time."
" This is how a thriller shud be. Changes genre and maintains solid tension n suspense.
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,9,"I am generous with a 9 cos i enjoyed it, simple, aint no wannabe critic.
This film was on my radar for a long time. Saw this recently aft finishing Dexter.
Michael C Hall is the primary reason i got pulled into seeing this n the director, secondary.
The performances r noteworthy too and another great aspect is the cinematography.
The best part about this film is that it is not at all predictable, the genre changes effectively with brooding atmosphere, ample tension and solid showdown.
Pls dont read plot synopsis."
" Absolutely loved it !!
",2020-09-01 00:00:00,9,"A fantastic down to earth realistic dark drama thriller, keeps you guessing and entertained on the edge of your seat all along the movie, really awesome.Must watch 9/10"
" Not Convinced!
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,6,"I love Michael C Hall, and I heard a lot about this one on movie podcasts. But I have seen this twice now within 3 months and I still think it's just OK at best when it comes to the plot. Mr. Hall is amazing as always."
" Extremely well acted thriller!!!
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,9,"Great story. Thought it was going to be predictable but it went in a great direction that made it an original thriller. Acting was superb, everyone!! Was nice to see Michael c hall in something different than dexter( which was a masterpiece of acting). Also Don Johnson never let's me down hes great in everything he does, only thing I wasnt a fan of was miami vice but every movie he is in he steals every scene!!"
" Bleak and violent portrait of a father who loathes his own son.
",2020-06-04 00:00:00,8,"My advice: wait, yes wait at least until an half an hour into this movie, before you decide what you think of it, because after half an hour a huge plot turn, totally turns this story into a bleak and violent rampage.The good: the acting is good, really decent acting. But the story has to be praised mostly, because it is chilling to the bone. NOT a crowd pleaser at all, NOT a fun gangster movie, NO way, this is as bleak and depressing and violent (in an ugly way) as you can get it. Not suited for below 16-18 years old.Any bad? Well, one of the leading characters hasnt got much charisma, although he doesnt act terrible either. Fortunately the only important other 2 actors, Don Johnson and especially Sam Shepard, act brilliantly.Beware: brief moments of very ugly violence! And mind you not to judge this movie by the first half hour, because only AFTER the first 30 minutes things get really shocking..."
" First rule If someone.....
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,8,"First rule if someone breaks into your house and you are scared of them abducting ur child, let the child sleep with you. That said, this is a great film. Great soundtrack. Excellent acting."
" Bloody Bro Southern Noir
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,7,Many different tones in this snappy movie. They threaten to derail it but it all stays together. It starts ambiguously but ends without doubt who the good guys and bad guys are.
" to long
",2020-03-22 00:00:00,4,"Good film let down by lengh,needs at least 10 minuets edited out maybe 15.Other then that good mystery thriller,some details are never explained."
" Cold In July brings synthesised chills, bloody sleet and fatherly responsibilities.
",2019-12-16 00:00:00,7,"The distinction between murder, manslaughter and self-defence is one that continues to grow more appropriate in America with each passing year. How does one determine the truth when only one key witness is available to divulge in their perspective? Especially when the odds are in their favour by accidentally shooting a ""wanted felon"" in the eye. The police view it as heroism. The general public questioning its intent. The victim's father overwhelmed with rage and demented turmoil, threatening the safety of the family thrown into the icy-cold chills of crime.Mickle's intentionally masculine crime thriller is one that evokes themes of fatherhood. The paternal rights and responsibilities of their children who may, or may not, be following the path of sin. Ever increasing the protectorship of their guardian figure for the sake of the family they have lovingly crafted. It's a natural instinct. To protect our own flesh and blood, no matter the cost. But what if that expenditure is too severe? What if their existence is causing suffering to others? The morality of these two fathers, the shooter and the victim's patriarch, is tested through unlawful extremities. Challenges that conjure inner turmoil. And it's only through Mickle's astute direction do we as viewers journey down this careening route of masculinity.What starts off as a simplistic revenge thriller soon complicates itself into an absorbingly comedic drama, whilst still shrouded in pulpy neo-noir aesthetics. Grace's booming synthesised score and Samul's ornate use of vivid neon backdrops cement the noir elegance. Yet it's Mickle's insistence in shifting genres, adding a quirky aura of surrealism to the mix, that acts as gritty adhesive. Does it work? Not quite. The brutal tension that is meticulously built up in the first hour is palpable. Slow panning through tight corridors. Strikes of lightning illuminating the bleak darkness of 80's Texas. The atmosphere compact with nullified thrills.Then the plot thickens. The local police become involved, a recruited Private Investigator struts his stuff and suddenly the genre changes. Intrinsic comedy is injected through Johnson's character, contrasting against Shepard and Hall's intimidatingly serious performances. Unfortunately, this relieves the suffocating tension that preceded it, relying on a clich√©d yet stylistic conclusive shootout with moments of jarring humour. Whilst it does add characterisation, Mickle's screenplay rarely furthers itself by being weighed down by overly basic dialogue. Conversational scenes, particularly between the two fathers, seemed muted. Lacking in fire and anger. If the script had been tighter with some sharper tongues for the characters, the complacent genre shift would've been more forgiving. The two were unable to mesh cohesively.That's not a detriment to the overall technicality and theatricality of Cold In July. It remained bitterly deadly throughout and utterly watchable. If only the script had been tighter and the narrative differences more seamless when transitioning, we could've had ourselves an incredibly rare hidden gem of noir excellence."
" 4 out of 10 stars for Don Johnson
",2019-10-24 00:00:00,4,"""Cold in July"" is yet another Texas noir genre fick, slightly evocative of the Coen Brothers' ""Blood Simple,"" but unlike that great classic, it takes itself too seriously and winds up with the requisite Jim Mackie gore fest.The film is set in 1980's. Richard Dane (Michael C. Hall), a middle class family man who owns a picture framing shop, is awakened by his wife (Vinessa Shaw) late one night because she hears an intruder in the house. Nervously pulling his father's old gun from a closet, he confronts the intruder and shoots him. The cops exonerate him because he was defending his family.But he is not exonerated by a man named Russell (Sam Shepard), the father of the intruder, who threatens Dane, stalks his kid, and breaks into his house.That's enough of a setup for a typical thriller, but the film takes a major left turn when Dane discovers that the man he shot was not Russell's son. He and Russell pair up with an aging cowboy detective (Don Johnson), and the three go on a quest for justice. I won't get into spoilers; let's just say that nothing is as it originally seems, and things get much nastier.This is by no means a great film. It descends into cliche repeatedly, and the finale is insanely violent, typical of director Jim Mackie's work. But allow me to praise Don Johnson. Honestly, I only know him as the pastel suit-wearing young cop in ""Miami Vice"" back in the 80's. When this film was made in 2014 , Johnson was 65, and what a surprise: He's great!. He's grizzled and stoic. He wears a cowboy hat, and he drives a red Cadillac with bull horns on the grill. He owns a hog farm and cooks bacon for breakfast. He pulls off his role with aplomb. He is the single best reason to to watch this film.Hall and Shepard are also impressive, but Johnson is the payoff in this film, without question.If you're a Mackie fan because you love blood and gore, enjoy the climax, you sicko. If you're an aficionado of great acting, enjoy Don Johnson."
" Johnson in great form!
",2019-09-02 00:00:00,8,"SPOILER ALERT: Last paragraph is character discription, which can be spoiler.Really enjoyed this movie. Fan of all 3 male leads but haven't seen anything with Don Johnson that I liked since Miami Vice & Nash Bridges. His character steals every scene from the others. My crush on him from the 80s came crashing back. But, this movie would still be good with another actor playing Jim Bob. Great story, great pace, great direction, starts out with a bang & never stops. Watch it if you like 70s-80s type movies.SPOILER ALERT: It has a flashy private detevtive, hard con with soft heart, introverted & awkward family man with a station wagon, bad mafia types & dirty cops."
" Watchable Indie Thriller...
",2019-08-07 00:00:00,6,"A set in 80s,Richard a common family guy,one night accidentally kills a robber in his home,soon he n his family were targeted by an a mysteries person
Film is very tense n gripping at beginning itself first ten mins is a edge of the seat moment..First half storyline is pretty simple a overprotective family man trying to protect his family from a ex criminals,in second half a twist changes the entire tone of the movie as a road thriller
Lots of unpredictable twists n turns in throughout the movie which makes this flick very interesting to watch till 150mins of it's runtime...As a big fan of Dexter series,Michael c hall performance is one of the top notch
Cold in July is a must watch thriller..."
" Not a great film, but definitely a good one.
",2019-07-28 00:00:00,7,"Michael C. Hall of 'Dexter' fame stars here as East Texas picture framer / family man Dane, who blows a burglars' brains out one spooky night in 1989. It's believed that he killed Freddy (Wyatt Russell), the lowlife son of ex-con Russel (Sam Shepard). Naturally, Russel starts to intimidate Dane and his family, but it isn't until Dane starts to doubt the cops and follow them around that he realizes that there are more layers to the story.Director Jim Mickle directs with style, adapting the Joe R. Lansdale novel with co-star Nick Damici (who plays the Sheriff). And yet, this viewer never felt that he was trying to call attention to himself, instead trusting the material and taking the time to tell an absorbing story. It's not perfect by a long shot, as it left this viewer with some unanswered questions. But it still holds ones' attention with its utterly somber quality (it's not without humour, but never, ever veers into outright comedy) and grim atmosphere.The good thing about the story are the turns that it takes. It's the kind of yarn that goes off in a direction or two that the viewer might not expect.Hall is good and under-stated in the lead role, an ordinary man obviously in over his head. The late, great Shepard is commanding as the sullen former jailbird, determined to see his son. Vinessa Shaw is given precious little interesting moments in the unfortunately under developed role of the concerned wife. Damici is good as the Southern lawman. Russell is effective as a character who's never given much screen time; you just know soon after you see him that he's pure scum. But it's Don Johnson who tends to steal the show as a chipper, slick private eye / pig farmer who fills in the gaps for Dane and Russel. Johnson, Hall, and Shepard do make for an amusing trio.Overall, solid entertainment; this viewer particularly enjoyed the haunting, John Carpenter-esque electronic music score composed by Jeff Grace and the moody cinematography by Ryan Samul.Seven out of 10."
" Disappointing
",2019-07-15 00:00:00,5,"Disappointing movie: it starts off ok, with lots of attention for detail, i.e. the time in which this played. However, as the movie unfolds, the story becomes illogical (what happened with the mafia?) and predictably ends in a shoot-out. I am afraid it is not worth watching."
" my notes
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,3,"Pretty terrible and kind of pointless. The story seemed pretty random. There were some things I liked, such as the music, and the blunt-ness of the shooting scenes. that's about it (1 viewing)"
" Noble shot at making something different, but it just doesn't quite work.
",2019-05-27 00:00:00,4,"I waited two days before writing this short review of ""Cold in July"", because I just couldn't decide how I felt about it. I've been wavering between 4 and 6. In the end, I'm only rating it a 4, because just too many things never made any sense and it felt like it was trying too hard to be ""different"", as opposed to coming at that label honestly. The film ultimately just relies on too many tried and true manly stuff, with some disturbing gratuitous violence thrown in, and resolves itself pretty much as expected. Parts of it are unpredictable, but then they seem ridiculous too, so they don't really work. I really wanted to like this film, but in the end it just made me feel bad and a little bit sick with no payoff for the depressing feelings. Therefore, I finally settled on 4 stars, although, as far as anything I'd typically rate as low as 4 stars, this is probably as good as it gets."
" Violent yes, but very enjoyable.
",2019-05-20 00:00:00,8,"When Richard Dane, (Michael C. Hall), shoots and kills a burglar his life, and that of his family, comes under threat from the dead man's father, (a grizzled and menacing-looking Sam Shepard), or so it would seem because Jim Mickle's excellent thriller ""Cold in July"" doesn't quite go in the direction we expect. It was adapted from a novel by Joe R. Lansdale but it could have come from Jim Thompson. It's also beautifully acted by Hall, Shepard and Don Johnson as a very unconventional private detective. It's certainly pulp fiction; it might have even been a B-Movie once upon a time, now given a high gloss finish. Very enjoyable, even if the violence may not be to everyone's taste."
" Why the this title?
",2019-04-19 00:00:00,8,"Really it's one of the ragey movies of my favourite, but it's been so long I opened this film, several times I opened the folder and chosed another movie because of this title, I thought it would be a lonely mother and a daughter's story in a slow art form.Oh lord and then one sad day i desided to see this sad movie.. and bang bang bang the movies a quite rollercoaster"
" A fantastic crime thriller with great twists!
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,9,"Cold in July is a great film. First of all, the performance of the cast is just perfect. Sam Shepard and Don Johnson make an excellent duo; the embodiment of oldschool brotherhood. Michael C. Hall is also perfectly cast for his role, his transformation from a decent middle class American citizen to a vigilante is depicted spot on.The progress of the storyline is very authentic to say the least. A breath of fresh air to recent Hollywood.Legendary work. I'm really glad Sam Shepard done this film before he passed away, a great work next to many others. May he rest in peace."
" Wow. How did I miss this the first time??
",2019-03-21 00:00:00,10,"The cast alone should have this movie on everyone's must see list. The acting is superb. One of Sam Shepard's last films. As always, he was great. Michael C. Hall never gives less than a stellar performance. Don Johnson was fantastic. These 3 actors were perfect for their roles.
The film itself is almost a noire. I love that it was set in the 80s. The set designs were right on the money.
It's a fascinating story of an average man with a conscience and corrupt cops who want him to ignore it.
This movie is fast paced and never dull. Do yourself a favor and watch it. You will not be disappointed."
" Still A Good Fun Suspense/Thriller/Killer Movie
",2019-02-14 00:00:00,9,02/14/2019 Definitely a good watch with plenty of changes and additions to the storyline that could be a plausible reality. Bon Appetit
" Well-Acted, Edgy & Totally Unpredictable
",2019-02-06 00:00:00,8,"An extraordinary feature of this edgy thriller is that no-one who starts watching it could possibly predict how its plot is going to develop. After a relatively straightforward opening that seems to herald a routine revenge drama, audience expectations are suddenly jarred when an accidental discovery made by one of the characters, reveals the first indication of what's later discovered to be police corruption on a grand scale. This opens the door to a vigilante enterprise that involves murder, torture, changed relationships, snuff movies and the activities of the ""Dixie Mafia"" etc.Set in East Texas in 1989, ""Cold In July"" is a character-driven piece that's rich in atmosphere, incredibly tense at times but also intriguing, entertaining and enjoyable to watch because of its many surprises, its moments of unexpected humour and the contributions of its highly talented cast.The peace of Richard Dane's (Michael C Hall) home (where he lives with his wife and young son) is disturbed one night by a suspicious sound and after nervously loading his gun, Richard goes to investigate. On finding an intruder in his living room and being startled when a clock strikes, he unintentionally shoots and kills the apparent burglar. Richard is a mild-mannered man who remains shaken by what's happened despite the assurances of local Sheriff Ray Price (Nick Damici). who tells him that he has nothing to reproach himself for as it was clearly a case of self-defence and the man he killed was a known felon.Richard, who can't get the incident out of his mind, watches the intruder's funeral from a distance and is surprised when he's approached by Ben Russell (Sam Shepard) who introduces himself as the intruder's father. Ben's an intimidating man who's just been released from prison on parole and some remarks that he makes, suggest that he's planning to take his revenge and has Richard's young son Jordan (Brogan Hall) in his sights. Terrified, Richard seeks help from the local police who initially don't take the threat seriously but when they do, soon take Russell out of circulation, much to the relief of Richard and his family.A little while later, Richard has to visit the police station to complete some paperwork and when he sees a wanted poster for the criminal who broke into his house and notices that the photograph on it doesn't resemble the man he killed. realises that something is very wrong. Uncharacteristically, he then embarks on a course of action that leads to a series of disturbing discoveries that radically change his relationship with Ben and brings him into contact with a colourful private detective named Jim Bob Luke (Don Johnson) whose involvement leads to further discoveries about a number of issues that are either directly or indirectly linked to the activities of the Dixie Mafia. The three men's further investigations then lead to some distressing discoveries, further bloodshed and the movie's disturbingly brutal conclusion.""Cold In July"" is a movie that looks great and features some gorgeous night-time scenes. It's recreation of the period in which it's set is impeccable and the whole drama is well-directed. The mood is suitably tense until the point where Jim Bob joins the action and the three men start to work together. Although all the performances are consistently strong, Don Johnson's stands out primarily because of his character's flamboyance but also because of the impact his arrival has on the whole atmosphere of what follows."
" Pleasantly Authentic with Amazing cast!
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,8,"A small ""dose"" of the underground world of the horrors of snuff films before the internet.Pleasantly surprised in this one as it retains an authenticity of the period of late 80s. That's always an admiral quality that even some higher budget films lack or fail in smaller detail.Love the cast! WOW! What a perfect indy script for these guys!
Nice to see the diversity and quality in the cast return to the screen."
" Could have been great
",2018-12-05 00:00:00,5,For two thirds of its running time this was a tense thriller with a strong storyline. And then it just went haywire. Suddenly a timid shop owner who is scared to hold a gun is taking on a large gang of criminals and mowing down anyone in his way. And for no logical reason at all - he is helping out a guy who had been threatening and victimising his family. Totally nonsensical plot twist. That said it is well acted with the character that Don Johnson plays being particularly entertaining. And yet it could have been so much more
" Why does this have a low rating??!!!
",2018-10-14 00:00:00,10,"I loved this movie a lot. I understand the second half is brutal and silly to some (not to me), but damn this movie had a great complex story that just kept twisting and turning going from tense to messed up to emotional; the three main actors - Shepherd, Hall and Johnson - were stellar, especially Don Johnson who should've won an Oscar for it, it was so authentic and he was charming; the score was great with a blend of 80s music, synth, and ambient sounds; the antagonists were really seedy and despicable people; and it was based off of a book written by an underrated author, Joe R. Lansdale. Jim Mickle is definitely underrated as a director and his work never gets the appreciation it needs. Definitely check out this hidden gem, I respect the negative reviews but to me it's a solid 10 out of 10, such an underrated movie. My god!"
" What's the point?
",2018-09-24 00:00:00,5,Why does Richard follow Russell? Who did really Richard kill? Why does the police want to kill Russell? This screenplay has a lot of flaws which should be fixed.
" The Movie Starts Getting Silly After the Mid-Point Plot Twist
",2018-09-13 00:00:00,6,"For the first half of this movie it seems as if you're watching a pretty standard ""revenge"" type of movie. Richard Dane (Michael C. Hall) wakes up one night and discovers an intruder in his house. This being Texas, he has a gun, he grabs it and he kills the guy. But it turns out the intruder's father has been recently released from prison himself - and now he's out to get the guy who killed his son. Simple and straightforward and, to be honest, pretty effective. Richard has a wife and young son who are obviously being threatened by this guy, and the scene in which Ben (the intruder's father, played by San Shepard) stands over the little boy's bed is actually quite chilling. It seems a bit cliche with all the standard stuff you'd find in this kind of movie, but it was working pretty well. But halfway through there's an interesting twist.The twist (which I won't say too much about - why give it away) is, indeed, interesting - but I didn't think it was especially effective. The movie first seems to turn into a story about police corruption, but then it takes another twist - much more dark and ominous. But from the plot twist on I found it increasingly difficult to buy into the story. It just seemed to become sillier and sillier, with a truly unbelievable alliance forming, and (again, without giving too much away) I thought the whole goal for Richard was to find out who it was he had actually killed in his house on that night - something that the plot twist almost drives from our minds (maybe deliberately, since it really doesn't make a whole lot of sense where Richard ends up going with this.) Ultimately, this becomes a very violent movie which seems to lose pretty much all connection with anything from that first half.It's not a bad movie. The leads (also including Don JOhnson as private detective Jim Bob Luke - hey, it;s Texas!) give good performances. I just didn't think the plot twist(s) worked very well. (6/10)"
" 4 to 5 Completely Stupid Occurrences Shy of a Good Film
",2018-09-09 00:00:00,5,"Wow, this would have been a really good movie if it had made even a little bit more sense. Does that fact not bother the people giving this 10 stars? It starts off as a very slow pot boiler, and then devolves into incoherency. I'm sorry, but Dexter's haircut just made me uneasy every time I considered it. I realize that probably 7 out of 10 dudes in East Texas in 1989 probably had horrible mullets, but that doesn't mean I want to look at them during an almost two hour movie, which leads me to the next minor (or major) point. This thing should have never clocked in at a second over 90 minutes. You could easily snip out ten minutes of filler without missing a beat. So in review, it's too long; those ten minutes make it seem two hours too long.So he kills a guy in his house in a very believable scenario. He is hugely remorseful. The cops use this act as a way to draw the attention of some guy they are after (Sam Sheppard) for reasons not really explained. He shows up and wants to kill the man who killed his son, a son he hasn't bothered to see since the kid was in kindergarten. OK. Got it so far.So the cops set up an ambush, but dad of the year slips away after assaulting a police officer. He is captured and held in custody. Now it starts not making zero sense.Dad has his old army buddy-private investigator look into things. Turns out his kid ratted and the Dixie Mafia-whatever that is-and goes into witness protection. To make it look good they fake his death-the kid Dexter killed is used. So why do the same cops want to kill his father. The filmmaker explains this by never mentioning it again, which is like an ostrich sticking its head in the sand.That's about all of the explaining they do in the movie. Did they send the thief into the house, or was it just a lucky break for the cops looking for a body no one would miss? I thought the cops did it to hide the identity of the son when he went into wit-sec. Then why would they want to kill the son? Or perhaps this was just a ruse to flush out the father. But if the feared ""Dixie Mafia"" couldn't find the son, how could his father succeed? Then why were the cops in such a hurry to kill the father? If his son is in wit-sec, why would he be making snuff videos? In the finale scene, his idiot son is hiding behind a chair? How could he have possibly lived this long while being so damn stupid? It just isn't possible. Don Johnson has his gunned trained on the kid and the kid turns around and shoots him? How? This almost the entire shootout scene was horribly choreographed.In the end it's a heart-warming father and son reunion...at least for a split second.The music was irritating at almost every turn, like they were force-feeding you exactly the emotions they were demanding from viewers. Sometimes you have to do this with the story. I wonder how they came to agree on the music for cleaning blood and brains off the walls and furniture of a living room. Personally, I don't think there is appropriate music for such a gruesome activity. When the song mercifully fades we are left with another heavy question: what kind of awful neighbor would leave his brain-splattered landscape, sofa cushion, and blood-soaked bags in the curd for all the world to see? Why didn't he just hire a sky-writer to leave a message that he just blew some punk's head off?"
" A thriller you dont want to miss.
",2018-09-08 00:00:00,8,"Only reason I watched this movie is because Im a huge fan of Dexter. Glad i watched it. It was refreshing to watch a movie with great acting and a plot that doesnt lose you. Don Johnson, Sam Shepard and Michael Hall worked great together. No BS CGI effects just a staright up thriller that relied on its cast and great plot."
" WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
",2018-09-06 00:00:00,8,"Richard Dane (Michael C. Hall) shoots an unarmed burglar in his living room and doesn't feel any Texan pride. Soon the victim's father Ben Russell (Sam Shepard) shows up and threatens Dane and his family. When Richard realizes the man he shot wasn't Ben's son, the plot shifts and gets twisty.The film starts out like a potential family hostage film and morphs into something else. It was a pleasant surprise. Good performances. This is listed as a crime thriller, but is closer to a crime drama.Parental Guide: F-bomb. brief sex on video, brief nudity"
" Cold in July
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,6,"I assumed from seeing the DVD cover, because of characters wearing Stetsons, that this film was a western, but it didn't matter, I saw good ratings from critics for it, so I gave it a go. Basically set in the 1980s, Richard Dane (Michael C. Hall) and his wife Ann (Vinessa Shaw) are startled in the home in the middle of the night by an intruder who has broken in. Richard is shaken by the experience, as he was starled by a noise and accidentally shot the intruder dead, he is identified as wanted felon Freddy Russell. Richard visits the cemetery on the day of Russell's burial, in his car he is confronted by Ben (Sam Shepard), Freddy's father and a paroled convict, he makes a veiled comment about Richard's son Jordan (Brogan Hall). Alarmed, Richard picks up Jordan from school and tells Ann to meet him at the police station, but the police decline to help, as they do not believe it was a direct threat. However, when the Danes return home, they find the front door has broken in, the police put under their protection, surrounding the house, including a guard inside, hoping to catch Ben when he returns. It turns out that Ben never left and has been hiding in the house's crawlspace, he emerges and knocks out the guard, Richard is alerted noticing water dripping from a ceiling window, the police are alerted and break in, but Ben has already escaped out of the window in Jordan's room. Ben is tracked and eventually apprehended in Mexico, Richard is invited to the station to close the case, while there he sees a wanted poster for ""Frederick Russell"", who looks different to the man he shot. Officer Ray Price (Nick Damici) refuses to listen to Richard's contradictions and discuss the issue, dismissing his claims as a trick of memory due to shock. Richard follows Ben being taken away in an unmarked police car, he sees officers forcibly removing him from the car, injecting him with an unknown substance, splashing alcohol on him, and leaving him on the train tracks to die. Richard saves Ben from being hit by a train, Ben at first does not believe Richard's claims that he that the man he shot was not Freddy. The two dig up Freddy's grave and open the coffin, Ben confirms that the corpse is not his son, and notes that the man's finger tips have been cut off to prevent identification. Ray Price visits Richard and claims that Freddy changed his appearance to avoid capture, explaining the discrepancy in the wanted poster. Richard is then visited by private investigator Jim Bob Luke (Don Johnson), Ben knows him, he says that the name Fred Russell is tied to several widely circulated news stories about the killing of a burglar. Jim comes up with the theory that Freddy got involved with the Dixie Mafia, and that he was caught by Federal investigators, who faked Freddy's death and placed him in Witness Protection in exchange for information. Jim, Richard, and Ben learn that Freddy might be living in Houston under the name ""Frank Miller"", they attempt to meet him at his home. Instead they find his car containins a number of incriminating video tapes, which turn out to be snuff films, including a film which sees Freddy Russell (Wyatt Russell, son of Kurt and Goldie Hawn) beating a woman to death with a baseball bat. Richard wants to take the tape to the police, but Jim believes the police already know about them and will be unconcerned as Freddy is a valuable informant, the victims are apparently illegal immigrants whom few will miss. Ben resolves to kill his own son at any cost, they track Freddy to a remote mansion where he and his associates are making another snuff film. They infiltrate the mansion and begin killing everyone they encounter, leaving Freddy as the last survivor, Ben hesitates to kill him, and Jim is shot. Freddy shoots both Richard and Ben before Ben finally wounds him, Ben declares himself as Freddy's father, killing his own son, shooting him in the head, and dies from his wounds. Jim and Richard set the mansion on fire and escape with the hostage, the next morning Richard returns home to his family. Also starring Lanny Flaherty as Jack Crow and Ken Holmes as Burglar. Hall as the protective family man, Shepard as the vengeful ex-con father and Johnson as the private investigator each give great performances, what starts as a simple revenge against the death of a son slowly evolves into a much darker story of criminal activities and police corruption, it is thrilling and suspenseful when it needs to be, it is disturbing and has terrific twists along the way, an interesting independent crime drama. Good!"
" Entertaining, but lacking a bit
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,7,"I wanted to really like this movie. I'm a fan of Michael C Hall and him being in this film was the main drawl for me. The premise sounded decent enough. In fact, it sounded original in my opinion so I was excited to settle down and watch it last night. The movie gets right down to business and I was pulled in immediately. It was interesting to see everything that probably would happen if you happened to kill an intruder in your house. Nothing pleasant there. I actually thought I had this whole movie figured out in fifteen minutes. I couldn't have been more wrong, but probably only because it started off being one movie and ended as another. Yes, this movie was actually two movies smushed together. Sadly, I enjoyed the first part much more than the second part. At least Michael C Hall was in it from start to finish. Honestly I think each half of the movie had they actually been two separate films would have been great, but as one it felt disjointed. I can't say enough that it is still an enjoyable film. I just wish it had stayed on the course it started on. The acting was very good. Sam Shepherd and Don Johnson were great in their roles and I could watch Michael C Hall act in anything. He's just so believable and so real that I find myself totally engrossed in whatever he's doing. He's a very serious actor, but he also does humor incredibly well even in a serious role. I love that!There was also a thing or two that never did get explained unless I somehow missed it."
" Signal! :)
",2017-12-18 00:00:00,6,"Pretty good movie. Like movies that bring You back to the wonderful 80's. Sam Shepard is good as always. Storyline is ok, I think they build up tention the futher the movie plays. The thing that blew me away was when Michael C Hall sat in his car and ""Arms of a stranger"" (Originally performed by AOR-band Signal) was played. This time by Aaron Daniel Jacob. That was unexpected....great track! One of my favorites..."
" Bloody Brilliant!
",2017-10-25 00:00:00,9,"This movie was epic! I highly recommend it for a movie night on Netflix. I didn't know what to expect but it's intense and thrilling from the first 60 seconds to the end! The twists are executed very well and the acting was superb. Considering all the other movies the director has done, this one was by far his best yet."
" A tonally inconsistent & just kinda stupid disappointment.
",2017-08-22 00:00:00,5,"It starts as a super-economical thriller focused on its one story with authenticity & specificity. However, as the story unfolds, questions begin to arise that make it harder & harder to fully engage. Why are these three guys such fast friends? How do certain characters become such hardened killers so easily? Why do some of these guys act super naturalistic while others are awkwardly acting like d-level Coen characters (I'm looking at you, Johnson)?"
" Never...COLD IN JULY
",2017-08-08 00:00:00,6,"Having a cold in July is pretty rough, but these cowboys have it worse.Man. Do I LOVE Neo-Western films. Or, I like to call them ""Modern Westerns,"" in which the setting is (mostly) modern times but with all the old Western tropes. Films in this sub-sub-genre include No Country for Old Men and Hell or High Water. This one is set in 1984, but it's closer to modern than 1885.While this wasn't perfect, it kept the interest, twists and tough guyness alive through to the end. With such turns in the story and characters we cared about, aside from one dud, it was worth the ride.Said dud kills an intruder one night to protect his family, either on purpose or accident, he still pulled the trigger. In comes ""the father"" to terrorize his family in vengeance. But, wait, there's more to the story as all I described takes place in the first 15% or so of the movie. Let the rest reveal itself, I say¬ÖThe motivations of Dexter, er, the father dud and the end superhero powers kinda took away from the realism, but it's still overall worth your time. Just suspend your disbelief, know it's not equal to mentioned other neo-westerns and enjoy the time they put into this. Besides, once you find out their motivations, you'll be behind them 100%. Just wish they were showing another movie other than Night of the Living Dead for the 1,998,827th time in a feature film. Really. You can come up with another movie within a movie. This was just lazy screenplay writing by this point.***Final thoughts: Sad to see Sam Shepard go recently. What a fine and tough-man actor he was and he will be missed. Me seeing this, however, was a mere coincidence as I just happened to stumble upon this movie having never hearing about it in its 3-year existence. Still, it was a nice send-off to one of cinema's greatest."
" Choppy Storytelling
",2017-05-18 00:00:00,6,"(Flash Review)Imagine an intruder breaks into your home at night and you accidentally shoot and kill them. How would you handle the situation? Then how would you deal with the intruder's father stalking and threatening you? That's how this movie starts off. Very tense and nerve racking premise. Then the movie takes a turn and ditches that plot line to follow a new twist. Then part way though that yet another storyline dropped for a darker and brutal twist. While all parts are very intriguing and gut wrenching at times, the movie feels to disjointed with bad editing and pacing and leaving too many key plot lines abandoned. This isn't a terrible movie, the acting is solid and the scenes are gritty but it needs another editing pass."
" Cold Cuts
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,6,"As a small town family man wakes up in the middle of the night to find an intruder in his house, 'Cold in July' gets off to a very good start with much tension in the air as he slowly approaches his living room where he can see that a torch is being shone. Things only grow more enticing after he shoots the intruder, fatally wounding him, and as the intruder's father then comes to town to intimidate him. Sam Shepard is great as the grieving father whose suggestive comments shake protagonist Michael C. Hall to his core. The plot then becomes even more twisted as events to come lead to Hall questioning whether the police have not been telling him the whole truth about the man he shot dead and the man's father. 'Cold in July' has a lot of interest to it as a film about police corruption and secrets within tight-knit communities, plus the 1980s-style pulsating music from Jeff Grace turns the movie into a real mood piece. The film loses its way in the second half though, going off on a tangent completely unrelated to the police force corruption, which in turns makes the two halves almost seem like two entirely separate films. That said, there is a fair bit to like in the way the dynamics between Hall and Shepard morph and shift throughout, and without giving too much away, the second half of the film could be considered as Shepard's tale whereas the first half belongs to Hall."
" Too many loose ends
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,5,"Cold in July is flawed southern noir seedy thriller set in the late 1980s. Dane (Michael C Hall) shoots an intruder in his home. He becomes a local hero but the dead man's father Russel (Sam Shepard) comes looking for him and threatens Dane's family. The police take Russel away but Dane discovers that dirty cops want to kill Russel. Now Russel and Dane team up and find out that the dead intruder was not Russel's son.To get answers, Russel brings in an old friend, a private detective Jim Bob (Don Johnson) who thinks Russel's son was involved in the Dixie mafia and now might be in witness protection. All three enter the dark world of snuff videos and vengeance.The film is full of plot holes, I never figured why the police wanted Russel dead and created such an elaborate scheme or why they were protecting his no good son. What begins as a cat and mouse game between Dane and Russel becomes a buddy thriller with Jim Bob providing comic relief."
" wot a load of tosh
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,3,"totally unbelievable , things just don't add up , you kill a man and then your wife is worried about the design on the sofa you just bought to replace bloodied one ? shallow or what ? put the bloodied seat covers out for the binman without wrapping them first ? our binmen wouldn't take them , risk of disease etc ! police leave a drugged man on the rail tracks but fail to wait for the train ?three guys then go on the hunt to find out who done what to who , and then the family guy turns into a pallid sort of clint eastwood when he was supposed to be so shook up about killing an intruder , has he all of a sudden grew some ?the world doesn't work like that !whoever wrote this load of rubbish needs to go back to the drawing board"
" Compelling and unpredictable
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,8,"For a lesser-known thriller, I was impressed by what 'Cold in July' had to offer. The storyline is compelling and unpredictable - you have no idea where it's heading based on what happens in the first few scenes. The plot twists are impossible to predict, with the film going in a completely different direction to what I was expecting.The acting in 'Cold in July' is top-notch, with three terrific lead performances. The film is well written and the plot is generally sound, despite a few gray areas where everything isn't totally clear. The pace is relentless from start to finish, there's never a dull moment and the film builds nicely to a tense finale. Overall, a very good thriller."
" Cold In July Almost Sustains
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,6,"This one gets off to a cracking start - with an instantly threatening situation involving a family who are placed in a position that can have one of several end results ‚Äì none of them good. The outcome that eventuates from the actions of the protective husband and father will change their lives forever, especially his. In the lead is Michael C. Hall who I was apprehensive of ever being anything other than serial killer Dexter. Hall throws off his past screen images perfectly. It's always good to find that regular performers from long running TV series can actually play completely against type roles and be very convincing. He won me over with this performance. Equally good is veteran Sam Shepherd and Don Johnson playing in turn, chilling and curious characters. The direction by Jim Mickle is filled with fine atmospheric touches - all captured by stylish director of photography Ryan Samul in crisp, moody shots and maintains the quality even when hand-held atmos type shots are needed. Jeff Grace provides and exiting music score in the style of Tangerine Dream (particularly reminiscent of ""Sorcerer "" '77). What lets them all down is a script that shows initial promise for the first hour or more - only to head towards being a cheap copy of earlier, better works. The turn for the worst comes when the trio are forced to head into the foreboding world of evil 'snuff' pornography. Some have said this brings a new dimension to screen nastiness but this theme had been explored with far more believable class, drama, and resolution - in 1999 with Joel Schumacher's ""8MM"". Possibly the problem here, lies with writer Nick Damici and director Jim Mickle having being previously grounded in the limited horror genre. For the last quarter of this work they tend to head back into this sensationalistic realm - turning the last chapter into an overdone massacre. Pity, for up to this point it was far more convincing (even though the motivations of some characters may not have always been believable). Very good up to a point but the ending ultimately lets it down. Undemanding audiences or those who don't feel the need to analyze what they watch should be entertained never the less."
" Lost potential
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,6,"A knee jerk reaction has consequences for the rest of your life. Most of us have been there. Cold in July starts out as an introspective thriller, it's easy to identify with how badly things can go wrong based on quick decisions. The thrill stays true to the mind-twisting ""that could have been me theme"" for a fair distance. It even gives the sense that it may be heading for greatness as consequences of bad judgement take centre part in the thrill. Then, just when it starts getting intriguing, it goes mainstream. It's hard to fathom that the same director (Jim Mickle) is behind both halves of this film. The, relatively, abrupt change of format makes little sense: It clumsily shifts the mood of the film and wastes away the initial efforts of subtlety. A bit like watching a relay race with David Lynch and Quentin Tarantino. And one thought will linger longer than any thrill from the film - why didn't Mickle finish what he set out to do? Although totally derailed from greatness, Cold in July still makes for a decent viewing."
" The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,5,"For lack of better terminology, these dark, southern, noirish, dramas have become all the rage in Hollywood. Films like Winter's Bone, Joe, and Mud have been highly critically acclaimed and have come to define the 2010 decade in film, but where there is success, there are bound to be copycats, enter Cold In July. Whoever thought that Don Johnson would have any kind of chemistry with Dexter what so ever, must have been out of there mind, as right from the beginning, this film was doomed. A simple man kills a home invader and is stalked by the father of the man he killed. Obsessed with taking a life and wanting to know more about what led to this man become the person he's become, Dane (Michael C. Hall) and his team of misfits, stalk the family right back and uncover an even bigger mystery. While this story had potential, the writers thought it was too dark and decided to have some fun with it. Isn't that nice of them, to combine misplaced comic relief with actors who have no chemistry at all? Cold In July doesn't only lack chemistry but it also lacks focus. At times this film is as dark and serious as it gets, then just as quickly everyone is drunk and paling around, it just doesn't fit and it doesn't work. The whole genre of these films is dark, disparaging, and sometime disturbing. If their is any humor or positivity to be had, it typically occurs at the very end. Michael C. Hall pretty much has the same dry personality as Dexter, except with a family and a conscious, while Don Johnson is the psychopath who wants to hurt people and thinks it's funny. The bottom line is this film is just a mess of actors who don't belong with each other, characters who should never have gotten along, jumping between scenes that are the complete polar opposites of one another. I liked the story and there are a few interesting moments, but it's just isn't enough to carry the film."
" Don't bother really
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,4,"(Spoilers follow) Not sure what positive reviews may be about. What I saw was: 1) Huge plot holes: the issue of the burglar's identity, one of the chief reasons for the main character's questing, dropped without explanation, police involvement and cover-up given but the most cursory of treatments, the Dixie Mafia connection just mentioned, etc., I could go on all day. 2) Lack of realism: a quiet small-town framer, suddenly and without adequate explanation, goes along with people he had no acquaintance of just days before (in movie time) into a firefight with snuff movie syndicate characters. None of the other characters involved (either on the ""good guys'"" side or the ""bad guys'"" side) have any real prior involvement with him. No proper build-up into this change of character is provided, no insight into the inner process that induces such a transformation is even alluded to. 3) Acting: unconvincing and dull, at best.In sum: it's meant to be a gritty drama-thriller, but it's boring, generally lacks pace (without any good reason, as rarely any time is spent in introspective insights into the inner path each person takes to the final shoot-out) and fails to give viewers any compelling reason why they should follow this guy's detour from average Joe (with hardly any redeeming features) to gun-totting vigilante and back to average Joe."
" Forgive the flaws and enjoy the creative script .......
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,7,"Sure there are several plot loose ends hanging uncomfortably. Sure ""Cold in July"" seems like two separate films pieced together. The fact is that both halves have good entertainment value. The first half is tense, while the second half is quite bloody. Ultimately this is a tale of revenge, and like ""Death Wish"", the transformation from the meek to the mighty is not always a comfortable one. Acting is strong, and the story is far from predictable. I could immediately watch this again, it's that entertaining. ""Cold in July"" is what good independent film looks like, and I highly recommend seeking this one out. In my DVD collection, ""Cold in July"" is a definite keeper. ......... - MERK"
