" It's a good movie.
",2021-03-10 00:00:00,9,"I honestly think people are being a little bit too hard on this movie. Was it the best movie ever? No. However I do think its still a great movie in its own right. It's an adaptation of the books, and we all know movies are never the same as their books but honestly there were some parts of the movie that I liked better than the books. I love the cast of the movie and I think everyone fit their roles well. For the people saying there was no ending, thats kind of the whole point. The movie ended pretty much where the book did. You can't fit a saga's worth of plot into one movie. I would still genuinely love to see the rest of the books made into movies if the original cast wanted to reprise their roles."
" Where's the story?
",2021-03-08 00:00:00,2,"This movie is all intro and rising action with no climax, falling action, or conclusion. Painfully incomplete."
" Love love love it
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,10,I absolutely love this movie! I've even bought the book series because I need to know what happens next!
" The movie was good... but what happened????
",2021-01-14 00:00:00,3,The movie was good composites to the first book of the series but as a stand alone movie it's not good because it just leaves you hanging. You don't know what happened to the girl(unless you have read the books). This is a series I would have loved to see complete in movies. And I think all the actors were perfect for their role. Maybe it's not too late to finish.....
" Huge waste of time
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,1,90 minutes of setting up a story and then no ending. No explanations. Nothing. Was this supposed to be a series? If so it still was a terrible pilot. DO NOT WASTE TIME WATCHING THIS.
" A disgrace to the fallen series
",2020-12-22 00:00:00,1,I am heavily biased on the books. This book series has gotten me through so many tough times and I LOVE the series so much. It's got love and action and is just a star struck love series but also a girl who struggles to understand things and struggles to find out who she is. The movies leaves out SO many important details and I only got half way through the movie when my brother had to turn it off because I was in a hysterical meltdown crying and walking around at how incredibly bad it was. It took characters from the first book and scenes from the second book. Nothing was right. Nothing made sense and you hardly felt the connection between characters that were so critical to the story. This movie is horrific compared to the books. I was SO excited to go see this in theaters when I heard it was coming out. I was so happy that I could finally watch something that had so much meaning to me. To hear that Lauren Kate actually liked the movie mad me so incredibly disappointed and sad and it was just depressing to see. I highly suggest this just never be watched. Please get the books or the audible series or something just for the love of every holy or unholy otlr whatever DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!
" Please read the books.
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,6,"I was so disappointed...maybe I expected too much. Having read all the books it was really I feel a hard thing to put into film.
Love love all these books.
Maybe I will warp the it again and give it another go...but it can't beat the books."
" Bet the book is great
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,3,The movie is subpar. Just like Twilight and Mortal Instruments. Yet not as good. It is very forced and not very well built up. The actings not so good. Lacking important information. Kind of boring. But I can tell the book is wayy better. The plot has real potential. Meaning it probably should've never been made as a movie to been more detailed. But I will most likely read the book.
" Read the books
",2020-12-08 00:00:00,7,"Cast was awesome, i just felt like the story was a bit messy and rushed. They trief to put as many things in a very short time period aka a movie while there are a lot of fat books behind this story... oh and they didn't bother adapting the book at all, they just took the idea and make a new thing out of it. So if you expected the book to be portrayed a movie, no, that's not happenening here. Rather the ""idea"" or ""the base of the story"" is there, all the character are there, but in which order thing happen, what happenens (some thing from the books didn't appear, some things were completely new which weren't in the book at all) and so on. It's not horrible, but the books were better for sure."
" If your expecting the book
",2020-11-25 00:00:00,5,"Word for word played out on film, your gonna be disappointed. But this would be immensely stupid to do. Very rarely are movies exactly like the book-almost never. Ur gonna have to dig to find which would be a waste of time. I always go into a movie fresh regardless of if I read book or not & many times find myself pleasantly surprised that it's so different. I feel like it's a hybrid between Mortal Instraments City Bones, Twilight, Beautiful Creatures. Addison Timlin & Lily Collins are both so amazing & it angers me that movies like were never Pheobe Tonkin & Nina Dobrev cuz they'd both be perfect for these type of movies. Even Emmy Rossum. So many negative reviews for Mortal Instruments...WHY?!!!! I'm not even a teenage girl & I loved that movie. I've prob seen it 10 times. Same as Divergent. Both movies were great to me. I guess I don't go into these kinda movies with stupid or unrealistic expectations.The one knock that is legit is that it seemed to recycle a lot of ideas & not all of em came together. But my God, we are now closing in on close to 100 yrs since the first ""talkie"" was made not too mention book after book & novel after novel for God Knows how long. So even when u think you've seen a fresh idea, chances are, some1 else did something similar decades ago at minimum. IMO this wasn't as good as Mortal Instruments which I would rate a 7 for myself. People who give that movie a 1 have zero business watching it in the first place because for that type of movie, it was really put together week. The chemistry between Lily & the British lad was great, the story was great, it had a solid cast for that type of movie. Very rarely are u gonna get a Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Faye Dunaway, Jack Nicholson and...well u get the point. Have some realistic expectations-cue the wise ass who chimes in, ""ya I expected for it not to suck"". The movie is average but very watchable & any1 giving the movie I 1-3 like prob doesn't even like fantasy-ish movies. It's like the people who hate Horror then the watch Friday the 13th & are mad they wasted their time & complain it sucked. Go read a book then that everyone else has read & likes. But I'm sure that would have u complaining bout something too."
" Stop All the Hating!
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,8,"I read the reviews and they were so unkind that I decided to write this review to let you know that the movie Fallen may not be the best movie in the world, but I feel the directer made a perfect mixture of reality with fantasy. Fallen angels; a fantasy. Two guys fighting over a girl; more of a fantasy. But the idea of the girl needing to go to a school for special people is more realistic. I love the chemistry between Daniel and Luce. The story that they've been in love for thousands of years comes to life as do the GREAT actors' chemistry. The ONLY thing I hated about this movie is that they left us on a HORRIBLE cliff hanger. Besides that, amazing movie!"
" Make a second movie
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,10,Wish they would have made a second movie. Would have loved to buy the dvds and go see this in the theaters
" Need a second movie
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,10,"I absolutely loved this movie wish they wouldn't have had the movie leaked and been able to make the second movie, but someone needs to help these mfs with some money so we can watch the second one and not be left with an awful ending. This would have been a great tv series. WE NEED A SECOND MOVIE"
" A teen movie without an ending. Sequel hunting but it won't get made
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,2,The teen movie is based on a book series and tries to get a lot of drama going early but never connects. Just poor acting and a poor plot. Then the abrupt ending and most reviews are like what the hell did I just watch.Overall this is just a lazy and unfinished film in hopes of getting additional sequels to extend the story. However the story isn't that good and with all the mistakes and dead end sub plots this is best left as it is and forgotten.
" Deserves its sequels.
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,8,"I love the casting. I love the chemistry between the characters. There were a couple plot holes unless you've read the books and know what's going on, but just as things are getting good, the movie ends and leaves you hanging. I want to see these characters finish their stories. I want to see the past lives and more of Daniel and Luce's story. It sucks that there won't be a sequel. Someone should do a kickstarter. I also love the way the angel wings look. That's my favorite part. If there won't be more movies, maybe do a tv show or something."
" A good effort, much like Twilight
",2020-10-15 00:00:00,8,"Fallen has good effects, so much so that you could almost describe it as a blockbuster. The characters are well chosen and developed, as well as well cast and played. There's not a lot of tension, and you tend to see what's coming, though the same could be said of Twilight. I did enjoy Fallen, especially for the characters and the effects, the lighting, the sets, the locations, etc. I didn't find it especially spooky, again, neither was Twilight, but it was exciting at times. Worth a look, especially if you like a fantasy tinged horror and teen drama."
" Just dumb
",2020-10-13 00:00:00,2,"I didn't even make it all the way through. By the time I got to the scene where the gargoyle fell off the roof and this simple girl just stood there and watched it fall toward her head instead of getting out of its way, I was able to figure out the rest would be as disappointing as what I'd already seen because it was already on my nerves. All I saw were dumb scenes like that. What is wrong with the director? If you wanted to have him save her from the gargoyle, why not have her talking to someone, distracted, with her back toward the gargoyle rather than looking up at it falling toward her face?? THINK, man. Dang."
" Loved it
",2020-08-10 00:00:00,9,"I loved this movie . It was fun to watch and the storylines as simple and made me want a love like luce and Daniel . It had scenes where I got emotional and scenes were I got anxious but I also loved the ending and how it made me happy . It is abit slow and some scenes are boring but overall I still loved it and really want a sequel to it. After watching this movie for the 1st time ages ago , I decided to keep rewatching it but it got removed off Netflix , until now when I found another way to watch it . The movie makes me want the books to read what happens next in the story line and I never like reading so this movie is that good I want to read the books to it"
" Trash
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,1,This movie sucks. Don't watch this movies. Very ugly movie.
" Please make the sequel
",2020-07-11 00:00:00,10,I thought the movie was great. Quality wise could of been better. But I love the characters and the story. Would be amazing to have torment made as film. You can't just start a series and not finish it. We need this to happen.
" Book vs movie? Which one is better?
",2020-06-18 00:00:00,5,"Since barely anything happened in the book, I thought that the book adaptation would be actually good, they just had to skip the boring parts. But what did the writers do? They added more subplots. Some of them are appear only in later books and some of them are brand new, and because of that the movie lacks focus and feels like a big montage, not an actual story.P. S.: Still better than the book."
" A poor production
",2020-05-30 00:00:00,2,"Aware of these books I expected an amazing journey to unfold on screen, I was disappointed. I agree with casting, however that is the only part of this film I can say. The film should've been guided more by the books it was based on, it seems someone gave them permission to slaughter a story that could've been a romance for the ages. I can understand why a second film was never optioned. If you loved the books, don't watch the movie."
" Book adaptation that needed a bit more
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,6,"The Fallen series by Lauren Kate are one of the best YA Fallen Angel series there is, however the movie was not up to the greatness that the books provide. This adaptation was enjoyable, the actors they choose where really good based on their character's descriptions, but something was missed, I hope they make the rest of the series otherwise this movie is laking immensely on the deepness of the story line. It will not make sense at all. I suggest reading the books instead or after you watch this, definitely it didn't do it justice."
" Enjoyed the movie
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,9,I wish they would make more. I never read the books but I enjoyed the movie. I was bummed when they didnt make more.
" Give it some credit
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,7,"I'm a HUGE fan of the books and overall I think they did a pretty good job with the movie. Some parts were cheesy but not any cheesier than the entire Shadowhunters tv show and that gets a lot of love. It did end WAY abruptly and with the amount of time it took them to get this movie out I was expecting more. All that said, I still liked it and would like a second one. Some scenes really were beautiful so it made up for anything lacking in my department. You've got your regular things missing that happen with book to movie adaptations but it's easy to get past the little things"
" HORRIBLE.
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,1,"I will start off by saying that this movie is complete and utter garbage and no one should ever watch it. Your time would be better spent blending up your hand and drinking it than watching this. It is so bad that it's not even worth watching if you have a fever and cant sleep so you are just cursed to watching movies glued to the couch.If I could rate it 0/10, I would.
Twilight compared to this is a masterpiece. And that says a lot about this movie."
" SEQUEL SEQUEL I NEED IT NOW!!!!!
",2020-02-20 00:00:00,10,"Please give it a chance, yes I admit the beginning is cheese but it gets way better thenmore you watch. I thought it was AWESOOOOME. Give it a try and have your own opinion don't base it on the haters."
" Goregous!
",2020-02-10 00:00:00,9,"When I saw the trailer for this movie, I was dying to see it! Then, I waited for it to come out in theaters but it never did. Which in my opinion was a huge mistake! Fallen is breathtaking. The scenery along with the director is amazing! I wish more movies of the YA fantasy would take note of this and use it. Every scene was picture perfect. The acting was great! I didn't find a single thing wrong with it except one scene. The club scene had way too much flashing. The romance was pure and made me fall in love with the story even more! I am so ready for that sequel! So, hopefully they make one soon!"
" Books are great, movie is shiate
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,1,"It is such a shame that the books have been utterly destroyed in this adaptation. It's like they just randomly shot a bunch of scenes and then slapped them together, it just doesn't hold your attention (boring). The books are amazing, but I really recommend NOT watching this. Please just read the books instead."
" What did I watch??
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,2,From start to finish the movie is beyond confusing. The story line is frustrating and makes no sense. Then the ending makes you want more only so you can know why she left with him!
" Interesting
",2019-11-27 00:00:00,7,"I've never read the books so I came into this blind. It is a well done, well acted, interesting movie. I do agree that it there was no ending. Did they run out of budget or hoping for a sequel? Anyway, worth watching."
" SWEET
",2019-10-16 00:00:00,6,"A sweet romance, pretty well-acted. Since I haven't read the books, I'm rating on the movie alone, and it's not bad. I especially liked the setting, sets, and props. Respects for that."
" Surprisingly good...but yes it's incomplete...
",2019-10-10 00:00:00,6,"I came with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised this movie held me captive the whole time. I'm not big on darkness themed stories but this had enough light to be worth the watch.
Having never read the books, I got to enjoy unravelling the mystery along with everyone else. The acting was great, production value and effects excellent. Maybe a bit clunky script/storyline but a valiant effort. Could have ended better, feels like I'm missing out on the bigger picture...but whatever...
Still though, that was some sick slo-mo shots... Wish I could look that good."
" Great idea, good movie
",2019-10-10 00:00:00,7,"I loved the idea. And liked the movie. But how is Hermione Corfield a top billed cast? I had to look at her pictures and zoom way in to even guess at which character she played. I think it's was the blonde girlfriend of the main guy who was in he movie for about 5 minutes total. Lola Kirke as Penn stole the show though, I loved her."
" Amazing
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,10,Great movie and directing. You couldn't get the better actor for Cam than Harrison.
" You will do better next time Kate.
",2019-08-15 00:00:00,7,"I loved the idea of putting the book into play but I'm sure someone else could do better than that and said this I would never dare to compare the movie with the book, even though the story's characters may be Mary Sue I love the way Lauren Kate writes so it is forgiven. The only reason I rated it 7 stars is because I've been dying to see this book into action even if it was made by a group of school teen-age boys."
" Many mistakes!
",2019-08-06 00:00:00,1,"The main mistake was: Lucinda is in a reform school, the movie transmits ""I'm here for having fun with guys"". The school has a beautiful architecture wich it does not make any sense because the goverment wouldn't pay much money on a reform school for looking amazing. There are no cameras, no windows with rows of thick steel bars, no barbed wire topping the fence around the building (all of these are in the book). In the book the attendant says: ""So remember, it's meds, beds, and reds, remember the basics than no one gets hurt"", than Lucinda said: ""What was it, meds - ?"", nothing like that in the movie!Second mistake: while in the book Daniel was rude with Lucinda by showing her the middle finger, in the movie he was not rude at all. Lucinda said that she thought that he was familiar, he said he doesn't remember her, than when she was going to tell him something more he got out of her side.Conclusion, to me the grade should be zero but is not possible to give that grade (imdb does not permit a zero). About the first paragraph, the're budget was 40 million, it was not necessary to much money on it if they put an ugly scene wich it would look like more a reform school. Okay that the movie does not need to be exactly like the book but it need to have the essence of it wich is blown away."
" No ending
",2019-08-03 00:00:00,5,"While I enjoyed the movie I was gobsmacked at the so called end. Was it a part one adaptation?
I've had to read other reviews to see I'm not alone in my disappointment, is there more to come?"
" Boring
",2019-07-26 00:00:00,3,The book was very good but the movie was bad.I think the producers choosen an actress like Nina Dobrev
" BRILLIANT
",2019-07-12 00:00:00,10,"Wonderful, storyline. It is simplistic in the best possible way. I loved all of the scenes. I saw the movie on HULU twice so far. I really hope the next 3 movies come out soon with the same actors."
" Fallen
",2019-06-27 00:00:00,6,Seemed like there couldve been more to the story...prob wouldve been better if it was a series...left a lot of unanswered questions...hopefully whoever created didnt give up on it an theres more to come?
" pretentious misfire, just short of unwatchable
",2019-06-14 00:00:00,4,"Mind numbingly predictable, plot holes and inconsistencies, Fallen is a pretentious misfire. The acting, screenplay, and pacing were intolerably bad. The characters were bland, sloppy direction, terrible editing and a rushed ending. Completely different from the books."
" Pretty average
",2019-04-29 00:00:00,2,The books are so much better. Hopefully number two comes out soon so there is a bit more of a conclusion to this first movie.
" Teenage Romance
",2019-04-27 00:00:00,3,"This film may have elements of the fantasy genre. However, it is just a teenage romance story. If you like that sort of thing, great, because that's all it is. If not give it a wide berth."
" Kind of bad
",2019-04-26 00:00:00,5,"I haven't read the book or even heard about it, so my rating isn't based on disappointment over that.
The movie is just kind of bad. It's watchable, and I did watch all of it, but it just feels very C grade in spite of looking quite nice.
I saw Lucy Hale was originally intended to star and I think she may have been better, although the girl they chose is not terrible. The cast ranges from okay to hammy.
It feels like a second rate Twilight with angels instead of vampires and the abrupt ending doesn't help."
" I'd give it zero stars if I could
",2019-04-22 00:00:00,1,"Some of the worst performances I've seen in a film in a long time, sianoa smit-mcphee's performance was terrible. It was like watching a poorly scripted high school stage play."
" Perfectly cast!
",2019-03-29 00:00:00,9,"I love, love, love the cast and their chemistry. There's some parts where the screenwriter totally made them sound bland and whatever. I know we won't get one, but I feel like a sequel could save this series, movie-wise, I know it's books have a strong following. I personally freaking love Addison Timlin. She was so amazing in Odd Thomas."
" For once an amazing cast that really has chemistry!
",2019-03-26 00:00:00,8,"I normally don't review anything, but I recently saw this movie on Amazon Video. I had not read the books beforehand so I didn't really know what to expect. The storyline is good, but the ending is abrupt and leads you to believe there is going to be a sequel. What really makes this moving good was the incredible cast! For once, I watched a movie adapted from a young adult novel series (Twilight, Divergent, Hunger Games, etc) that finally got the casting RIGHT! The entire cast has chemistry and there isn't a role I would change. The love triangle is so believable and the actors do such a wonderful job portraying the emotions they are feeling that you don't know who Luce should choose. Both male leads do such a great job without one standing out more than the other. The girl who plays Lucinda Price is a fantastic actress. I had seen her in the movie Odd Thomas and she did a great job in that movie too. She definitely has potential for a long successful acting career, actually the entire cast does and I hope they all do. The young woman who payed Luce reminds me of Natalie Portman and how gifted of an actress she is. There's just ""something"" about her that makes you believe in her. She plays a 17 yo girl who is suddenly in love, who is questioning her life and everyone around her. Her character reminds me of Bella in Twilight, but for once the role is acted by someone who is believable and likable. Actually, all the roles are so well cast that I loved the movie,even though the story got choppy at the end. I did go and read the book series after I saw the movie and I think they were trying to combine the first two novels together. I really hope they do a sequel and get the story together better because it would be a shame for other people to miss out on this fantastic cast and potential storyline. It should be as much of a success as Twilight was, but better due to such a great cast. It's sad to see this series not be a commercial movie success. I hope the screenwriters get it together and make this franchise and group of young actors a success!"
" I like it
",2019-03-06 00:00:00,8,"I like it! I have not read the boks yet so i dont know if the to are close or not. But i Think the movie is good! There are somethings that are not that great, thats why it is only 8! But over all i like i a lot"
" Great movie!!!
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,10,Great movie!!!! Jedva cekam novi nastavak! Nadam se da ce snimiti nastavak!
" Loved it.
",2019-01-31 00:00:00,10,"Even if the book has more details and in the movie many parts are missing, I still loved it very much.
Good actors, good scenography and style.
Loved Cam so much."
" 😍
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,10,"I loved the movie and I'm loving the book.
I hope they make a movie adaptation for the other books."
" Don't listen to the haters!
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,8,"So I'll start by saying that I have never read the books. To be honest I'd never even heard of the books or the movie until last night. While searching for something to watch I stumbled upon this and despite all the bad reviews the trailer caught my interest and I decided to give it a go anyways.I was pleasantly surprised! I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The idea wasn't totally original of course. It does have a lot of similarities to Twlight, while also being nothing like Twilight. I enjoyed the characters, though I will say that many of them didn't get the opportunity to be fully explored, which I found a bit disappointing. But overall it was an enjoyable story with some cool special effects. I definitely felt the intensity of the relationship between Luce and Daniel and it left me wanting more. But that being said, the movie ended with the creators clearing planning on the sequel so there were a lot of loose ends left hanging. It seems this movie didn't do very well so my hopes for a sequel actually being made are pretty low, which is disappointing since so much was left uncertain.But I enjoyed the film so much that I'm going to read the books now and hopefully get the closure that the movie was lacking. Don't get me wrong though, it's not like the movie ended on a massive cliffhanger, it sort of tied up, but just left me with so many more questions. I want more and that will come in the form of books!I'd definitely recommend this movie if you're a fan of Twilight or Vampire Diaries or The Mortal Instruments (Shadowhunters) series."
" Not great
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,3,"Does not do the book justice, loved the books but was just so disappointed by the movie. It missed out so many key scenes and feels rushed"
" Seriously, WTF ...
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,1,"Dang, I don't even have to watch more than that lone trailer to see this film is freaking horrible. I love Lauren Kate's books and this loose adaptation is... ugh!!
Characters look broken and feel sparsely connected to the originals. Storyline seems to have added bits of fluff and crud. Even the book setting has reminds me of somewhere different; why is it Hungary not Georgia? Lots of random scenes from Torment are even thrown in there, too.
Yeah, it looks so bad I refuse to watch the entire film."
" What just happened?
",2018-10-28 00:00:00,2,"I never read the books, so thought I would give it a go.
Spoiler Alert:
Was there supposed to be an end to this film, or did the script writers conscience climb out his brain and strangle him mid scene?
Can I ask the readers of the book, did it just end mid page also? or is this some new pseudo cult cinematic technique, or just poor directing?
Maybe this is the pilot movie to a spin off series, where the protagonists fight it out for another 7-seasons?
Hey! I'm gonna be cool too, and just stop mid revie..."
" So disappointing :(
",2018-10-18 00:00:00,1,"I loved these books when they came out, so when I heard there was going to be a movie adaptation, I was stoked. Unfortunately it just didn't hit the mark. The characters, aesthetically, looked the part, but that was where the similarity ended. I know that most books to movies are going to differ, but alot of this was very different. It also focused so much on being arty that it didn't really flow properly, as well as it ending quite abruptly. I'm not sure it would be able to be followed at all if you hadn't read the book prior. Just disappointed unfortunately."
" What did I just watch? Twilight with wings?
",2018-10-08 00:00:00,1,The acting isn't much better than the acting in Twilight. I feel cheated because the previews made it seem like this movie was going to be amazing but it sucked. I hate how the end just cuts off. It's definitely a subpar movie and I'm not planning on watching it again.
" What even is this?
",2018-10-05 00:00:00,2,"This movie makes no sense at all, the acting is okay, not really a point to complain on there. But the store line is so flawed, and the camera is often bad. Aiming too close to people with weird colors, lights, and mist around their faces for no apparent reason. Everyone is mopping the entire movie, and the bad woman could have killed the girl the first time she walked into the school. She was alone with her, and could have been alone with her many other times too. But she never tried to kill her until the good guy was there to fight her off. It made no sense, and was very flawed."
" WE NEED MORE PARTS!!
",2018-10-04 00:00:00,10,"It's not bad for a first movie, we book fans want the other parts to be filmed too !!"
" Liked it
",2018-10-03 00:00:00,8,"Ok so o saw the preview for this movie & thought I'd watch it. I liked it until the ending. It just leaves you hanging, wondering what happened to everyone. Unless I'm missing something like there's more than 1 movie but I haven't found it yet. It somewhat gave me the feeling that I was watching something similar to Twilight or that I was watching Twilight only instead of vampires & werewolves you have angels."
" Nah
",2018-10-02 00:00:00,4,I watched the movie because of a sneek peak I saw at instagram. The story seems very nice but the movie looks like it's unfinished. It seems like there is another part of this movie because the end was really bad.. did not like it at all.
" good premise. no resolution.
",2018-10-01 00:00:00,4,You're left feeling something's missing because nothing gets solved in the end. there's more questions than answers. its just not good. love the premise. will probably read the books but this movie is lacking.
" No....just down right NO!
",2018-09-29 00:00:00,1,"I love the books and when I read the author was working with someone to make it a movie. I expected the next ""Lord of the Ring"" type series. Movies that flowed together that gave the books justice. This needs remastered and redone. New actors and graphics crew and republished when done properly. I'm disappointed that the authors even allowed this to be released."
" Enjoyed it
",2018-08-31 00:00:00,10,"I very much enjoyed the movie, it is different from the book, but most movies are. If you have read the book be aware that, there's things missing. I really liked it and I hope they come out with the second one."
" Slow start
",2018-08-23 00:00:00,10,"This doesn't really have any spoilers but I'd rather not have some prick report as such and have it deleted. This has a slow start but once it gets going it has you wanting for more and wondering when the next film in the series will be released. I honestly can't wait, pretty sure the fact that I'm crushing on Jeremy Irvine isn't helping matters. Hopefully they don't do a recast of any of the characters if and when they make the next film, if they do that then it'll definitely be a fail"
" Phenomenal!
",2018-08-14 00:00:00,10,"First, Lauren Kate is amazing!! I own the complete series in paperback, on my kindle, and in audible. And, I'm now the proud owner of the dvd.
Second, this is the best book to movie I've seen in a very long time. I'm normally disappointed in the liberties taken to create the book to movie (Beautiful Creatures, Mortal Instruments, Twilight series - especially Breaking Dawn part 2, to name a few).
Third, the casting was incredible!!! 
And fourth, please tell me there will be more coming!
I definitely recommend seeing the movie and, of course, reading the books."
" Good
",2018-07-23 00:00:00,10,Very interesting and intriguing . I didn't read the book until after I saw the movie . And I do believe that they could have done more of what happened in the book and put some more information into their past lives. But I'm exited for the 2nd movie to come out
" Brillant
",2018-07-20 00:00:00,9,"Just watched this movie and its amazing!!! not what i expected at all, at the start it was a bit boring (took a while to build up) but then it really pulled me in! and i couldn't press the pause button!! recommend! love love love this movie!Favourite movie!"
" Very romantic and beautiful story
",2018-07-14 00:00:00,8,"I love this story very very much. if you're a romantic girl, this movie is for you.
If you read the book: yes, the movie didn't follow exactly the book. But c'mon (in my opinion) the actor are perfect to the ideal of the characters that we could make. And it is difficult to respect every steps of the book. in the beginning of the movie the narrating voice make spoilers which you will know only in the 3* and 4* books. But the couldn't do otherwise. Read a book or watch a movie is a different thing. The movie flows faster than the book. It couldn't respect him exactly, it would be a little bit boring. In a book the feeling and the adrenaline are more active. I think that if you love the story and if you watch it again, you'd like it more. 
If you didn't read the book: the movie may seem a little short. it's because it's a saga and the story continue in the next book/movie. But yes it may seem short and the flaw is that it's little skimpy and when you begin to understand something and when you start to become attached to the characters the movie ends. But this is the only bad thing to me. It's a great movie, great actors and it deserves to be watched. It's a very romantic and beautiful story. I'm waiting (and hoping) the second movie!"
" Hands down the best movie I have ever seen in my life
",2018-06-30 00:00:00,10,"God like actors, perfect lines, not cringe at all, I am love with this can't wait for next one."
" I need answers
",2018-05-20 00:00:00,6,Why was there no end ??? What happened? Did she live? Did her mate die ?
" Fallen
",2018-05-03 00:00:00,9,"Read the books and was very impressed by the first movie. Books are always different from the screenplay, but felt like they did a good job. I can't wait for the next movie."
" should not watch
",2018-04-14 00:00:00,1,"It will only be waste your time.
Actress is cute only.
But no story at all. And end the movie suddenly.
so disappointed."
" If your looking for a stereotypical, joke of a teenage angst film, this is the one for you...
",2018-04-13 00:00:00,2,"Although there are some hot guys, they are heavily unrealistic, with just a couple dramatic far off looks to one another they are suddenly very intimate, and God knows if that actually happened in real life I wouldn't be so lonely. That and the lack of emotion in both tone of voice and characterisation makes this movie dull yet laughably enjoyable, although we're not laughing with the characters, we're laughing at them. Although there is some characterisation, the main actress destroys any chance of being involved in the movie by her boring and basic character, a piece of paper has more of three-dimensional character than her.
Overall there is more of a story to humpty dumpy than."
" Excited for the Sequel!Must watch and watch out for!
",2018-04-12 00:00:00,9,"Watching this first installment compelled me to Read the Books (just finished Book 4 in less than 4 days) so I say it's good. Though the movie was low budget- it served it's purpose- entertain,stimulate curioosity,appealed to the emotions (i laughed,cried,goosebumps,fell in love while watching).I loved how the casts portrayed their roles and the chemistry was there. This series is beautifully written by Lauren Kate and it deserves to be on the silverscreen.Just please better movie adaptation + marketing:) More of this franchise please!:)"
" If you aready read the book do not watch this movie. Big dissapointment!!!
",2018-03-19 00:00:00,1,"I finished reading first book half an hour ago and I couldn't wait to see this movie. I had such a huge expectations and I wanted to see so many scenes ... but guess what? Person who made this movie probably wished to be a writer but he didn't manage so he decided to change someone else story. I got so annoyed after 5 minutes of the movie. And that was just the beginning. Let me tell you, do not waste your time on this movie if you read the book already because of three reasons:
1. You will save your energy, nerves and strenght.
2. You will have no reason to hate on people who made this.
3. You won't have to witness so many bad done scenes.
Those three reasons should be enough. I hate when they try to destroy books with movies. Same as they did with VA and Percy Jackson. And they do not get why fans were angry. Serously?! But, if we compare VA and this, I can say becase I am VA fan myself that VA was 100000 times better than this. At least main actor and actress did not dissapoint me. Christian too. This dissapointed me like no other movie. Horrible. Do yourself a favour and just skip this. My advice. P.S. English is not my mother tongue so sorry for mistakes. I ams sure there are plenty of them but I hope you could understand me.)Greetings!"
" Books were better...
",2018-03-09 00:00:00,3,"I really love the books, they have been my favorite series since I was 13. That is 8 years ago. The movie was a long wait, so I expected more. I still love the books, I just can't get over the movie. It was very rushed, and the chemistry between Daniel and Lucinda is awful. I never say a movie is a bad movie, but since I love the story the book tells and I kind of feel like the movie let down that story, I have to give it a 3. But if you haven't read the books, you should see the movie and see if you like it or not"
" Great adaptation!! Finally a good one!
",2018-02-03 00:00:00,10,"I absolutely loved this movie!
I'm a big fan of the books, so I was thrilled to find out a movie was made.
I didn't have high expectations as there wasn't any publicity for this movie and I only found out by chance...I couldn't be more wrong, as I was captivated from the beginning to the end.
The actors are great, the atmosphere is perfectly created, the music is well-chosen and the story folds out in a very nice way.
Does it make you think of Twilight? Yes, In soms ways.. But I don't mind, as I enjoyed every minute of it.I will definitely watch it again!!Keeping my fingers crossed to see all the other books into movies as well."
" Loved
",2018-01-31 00:00:00,10,The books were better but what book isn't. I loved the movie anyway and I can't wait to see if they will be making a number two to answer all my unanswered questions
" Don't waist your time with this BAD Twilight-like movie
",2018-01-13 00:00:00,2,"It is so poorly written that it will make you cringe. It is basically Twilight but instead of vampires and werewolves you get only angels that are poorly written. Later I found out that it was based on books, hope the books are better.
The movie introduces a young teenager called Lucinda being enrolled in the one and only facility in the world where crazy/weird-ish teenager are accepted. Every time she looks at someone her face expression is like I am so fascinated and trying to look like Bella from Twilight. There is literally no backstory or anything that will make the supposed main and supporting characters interesting. There are a lot of stereotypical teenagers-angels which are portrayed by actors who look old enough to be last year in college/university. You cannot get emotionally involved in any character because the whole movie was Lucinda being confused and having unanswered questions. If you need explanation to why she loves her soulmate so much, you wont find it in the movie. The Jacob-inspired guy is not even an option for her although most of the scenes where she is not magnetized by Daniel /a.k.a Edward/ she spends with him. The whole movie is so predictable that it is really not worth the time... And the ending scene was weird and the expressions of the actors were: I think I have a constipation...
I liked the idea of the wings from light and the music was not bad. Everything else was awful."
" Atmospheric & entertaining, though a tad confusing for those who don't know the books
",2017-12-28 00:00:00,7,"So this landed on my desk at the library a few weeks ago and I decided to at least watch the movie after I'd avoided reading the books for almost eight years. (Angels, demons and ""one true God"" is a bit too much monotheism for this Polytheist girl.) 
To my surprise, I actually really enjoyed this movie despite some glaringly obvious issues, which I'll get to in a moment. 
First of all, the Southern gothic setting, the misty autumn atmosphere and blueish tinge of the movie worked in favor of ""Fallen."" Right from the start you get into this alternate universe/Fantasy mood and it won't let you go until the very end. 
As far as I read the movie had been in the works for years and the cast had been decided upon long before filming occurred. That may explain why none of the cast look like teenagers but well into their twenties. Most of them are. That aside the actors - though mainly unknown - are top notch in my personal opinion. Great casting on all levels. Addison Timlin has something gentle, broken and yet determined about her. Harrison Gilbertson is simply perfect for the role of Cam. There's something undeniably charming and enticing about him and yet you can feel the danger emanating from him. Jeremy Irvine's performance was also pretty solid. 
 
The story is a typical Fantasy YA Romance with a few elements that remind of Stephenie Meyer's ""Twilight."" (Let's remember that when the first ""Fallen"" book came out ""Twilight"" was the creme de la creme of YA, and frankly, I still love it, so there.) 
There's a love triangle of sorts, a big secret surrounding the three main characters, tragedy and forbidden love. If that is your thing this movie won't disappoint you. Alas, it may confuse you if you don't know the books. I had a few pressing questions that were never answered throughout the movie, instead I was rewinding and forwarding again to see if I'd missed anything. 
First of all: Why does everyone wear black. Is everyone into Metal? The Gothic lifestyle? - Aha! And ever since I decided to read the book I can give you the answer: There is no official or sponsored school uniform at Sword & Cross except all students must wear black. I mean. It would have been one sentence in the movie...you could have explained this so easily...but okay. Secondly, if Penn has access to Luce's student file, and knows it by heart as it appears, why was she surprised it was Luce's birthday. But how did Cam know? Come on. (Big YASS, well done from me on integrating the beautiful dress from the book cover of ""Fallen"" into the movie though!) What exactly is Molly's issue with Luce. It's obvious she's not just your stereotypical mean girl but she knows a LOT about Luce's past. Does everyone know about Luce at this school? What was that scene with Roland, Arianne and Gabby discussing Luce's inevitable death? If you are an astute viewer you may at some point come to the conclusion that all of the above characters may not be human and that is how and why they have insight into Luce's current as well as previous lives. Which brings us to this question: How did they all end up at Sword & Cross? Or more accurately: How did Luce end up there with all of them? This is also explained in the book and it also would have taken no more than a sentence to explain in the movie. I was always wondering if the angels somehow caused the fire to get her to Sword & Cross? They are ""fallen"" angels after all, right? Or was it Daniel even? Or Cam? But for what reason? So this remained pretty confusing throughout the entire movie until the end. It's a darn shame that most of the characters that are important in the book are banned to the sidelines in the movie. Arianne's character would have deserved more. And so would have Gabby's actually. 
At the end of the movie it is revealed that they, too, are angels. They kneel over a dead Penn and tell Luce not to worry, that they would take her with them. What does that even mean? Take her where. They are banned from heaven. So...like...is Penn still alive? Are they gonna revive her with angel powers and put her someplace safe to recover? Sigh... Finally, let's talk Miss Sophia. Okay, so in some bizarre ""twist"" (cop-out?) Penn overheard Miss Sophia talking to someone (whom??? And what was said???) and alerted Luce to the fact that it had been her who set the fire in the library. 
But...like... is the conclusion that Miss Sophia also set the fire at the lake house? She didn't even know Luce's current incarnation then. What is going on. So then I thought it must have been the shadows, right? But shortly afterwards Daniel explains that the shadows, the ""Announcers,"" can't hurt anyone but only show you your most memorable moments in life. (That's not even entirely correct in the books at least). So who set the fire that Trevor died in? This is driving me nuts. None of this made any sense. There was a lot that should have been explained in more depth, even if only - as I have said - just in a side sentence or two. Instead this movie relies a lot on being artsy. There are a lot of atmospheric and scenic shots, a lot of slow mo too...and that's nice...but if you'd cut all of that out or shortened it somewhat you would have had enough time for actual plot and character development. I wonder why this film came out so late, far after these kinds of stories and this genre are actually interesting for the intended peer group. It's a shame. Also not having any promotion at all didn't help the matter I reckon. I would have rated this movie a 6 before reading the books and confirming a few suspicions that were insinuated in the movie. I am not sure if Torment will ever be shot or not (I hope it will!) but I am crossing my fingers that they will do a LOT of explaining to make up for some of the first film. Though I focused more on some of the issues ""Fallen"" had it really and truly is an overall intriguing, enjoyable and pretty swoonworthy film with great music, acting and atmosphere. I have rewatched it several times now and am still entertained by it at least."
" What did I just watch...
",2017-11-20 00:00:00,3,"I will preface this review with the fact I have never read the books and therefore do not know if it was a good adaptation or not. However, from a movie perspective it was sloppy and confusing. The ending came out of no where and I have no clue why she picked the other guy over Cam. The very fact I have had to refer to him as ""the other guy"" just shows how unmemorable and lacking he is as a character considering he is supposedly the male lead and main love interest. There lacked any real chemistry between them and in general Cam just seemed a more interesting character. They made a big deal out of the fact she wasn't baptised and then kind of threw in the explanation ""oh you'll die for good this time cause you aren't baptised"" in at the end as if it meant nothing. Really they needed to have a slower reveal rather than explaining the entire backstory in the last 5 minutes. Also, none of the characters but Penn seemed fleshed out. I didn't feel sad when Penn's friend died because I really had no clue who he was, I couldn't even feel sad when Penn died because it was so sudden and was followed with the promise that the angels would ""take care of her"" - Also what does that mean? Are they going to bring her back? I still don't even really know what happened in this movie, and feel I need to read the books just to understand. I assume that they were planning a lot more backstory to go into a sequel but the quality of this movie makes me doubt that will happen. This film felt more like a lead up to a sequel when they should have focused on having a good movie with a strong plot and memorable characters."
" My opinion about Fallen
",2017-11-19 00:00:00,10,"Fallen is a film directed by Scott Hicks. Is one of the most interesting movies that includes both the mystery of love, adventure and fantastic.The film tells the story of Lucinda, a young girl of 17 who is sent by his parents to a school in Savannah because she was accused of causing a fire in which a young boy was killed. Once arrived at the school, the young girl faces totally different people. But in spite of this, however, manages to make friends among them Penn, a wise young man who seems to know the rationale behind the surroundings. Of crowds of students, two guys-Daniel and Cam looks like fail to arouse the interest of the girl. Trying to find out more about their past, a mysterious young girl seems to have increasingly more often related to life visions to previous in which two young people apparently surprising strangers seem to have played a rather important role. To find answer to all her questions, Luce is forced to fight against the hell and the end seems to assume decisive over everything that involves love.The entire set is meticulously realized, the entire music landscape and perfectly completes the actors are also consists of the characters that you interpret giving the viewer an amalgamation of strong.This movie worth watching, perfectly as one of the most unusual and challenging love stories whose final is over any limit to imagination.12C"
" I really hope they're planning on a sequel.
",2017-11-08 00:00:00,9,"As someone who's read the books that this movie is based off of, I definitely liked how the story was portrayed. I don't know what the budget was for this movie, but I wasn't disappointed with the graphics, location, or the choice of cast. At times it can seem a little cheesy in the dialogue department, but personally I didn't mind it. The movie hasn't seemed to get much attention, at least not in the US, but I hope that, in spite of that, they make a sequel."
" Lucifer is Back Again for Another Try
",2017-10-23 00:00:00,2,"Acting was really bad, typical high school drama level, and in some cases such as school personnel you would think they had never been in a school. Teen level plot of eye candy lovers with Bible history 101 as their backgrounds as they seem to be immersed in the story of the fallen angels doomed to stay on Earth as a result of the conflict between God and Lucifer (i.e. Satan). The building for these trouble teens seemed like a prop for a Victorian horror set. The CGI was cheap and the dialogue high school level. Scenes were dumbed down, e.g. the students sneaking out for an all night kegger in which kegs appear out of nowhere in this isolated setting."
" Give it a shot (Spoilers)
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,8,"The movie is not as horrible as some here are saying. I'm not sure what people are expecting. For a low budget YA adaption, I thought it was pretty good. The cast is spot on, IMO. I wish the actress playing Luce had been picked as Bella. I loved the film overall, enough to go buy a copy. I've seen it about six times, liking it more and more. It's a quiet movie, but with beautiful filmography and great music. Go into it with an open mind and you just may like it."
" Loved this movie
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,8,"For a book adaptation it was not bad. Many reviews I believe were too harsh. It was certainly a better film than the first Twilight. It was different than the book in some ways, but the casting was spot on in my opinion. I watched it expecting to hate it, but have watched it six times. I love it more each time. It's not going to win any academy awards, but it was very entertaining and romantic in a beautiful way. It was well done. The soundtrack was great. Don't watch with high expectations. Just watch it with new eyes and enjoy."
" Both great and awful
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,6,"Honestly, this movie is great but, it was also awful. I know a lot of people hate in these reviews but this movie i honestly felt like i should give one too. The movie itself seemed pretty good, the plot and the actors were excellent but, the ending was not an ending. I know a lot of people just say its an open ending, but this was such a bad timing, its almost like the movie started with a budget and just used it up before they could ever finish it and decided it would just end. I have never read the book, and i just found this movie in a trailer, but if you like teen romances and you just want to watch a great movie, then you should watch it. But if you are looking for a really good, deep thought movie, then this is not the one. I really liked it but it went so fast and was so predictable. I gave it 6 stars because it is both great and awful at the same time. Hope you enjoy!"
" Awesome & I can't wait for the next movie
",2017-09-14 00:00:00,9,I was surprised that I didn't know this came out or more advertising. I loved the series & the passion between those two was so dead on. It followed the story but it could have been longer. I would like to see more detail of the past like the books. I loved it. Yes they could have spent more on the budget. All in all. It made my night. Tell me they have another planned. Lauren Kate are you guys hearing us? Great beginning but my daughter was upset at the cliffhanger. She didn't read the series. She enjoyed it & wants to see the rest of the story. The fans are waiting.
" hmm
",2017-08-29 00:00:00,1,"ya know... i actually wanted to watch this movie (not sure why, probably just hot girls...) but, $9.99? really? that takes some balls. i would've gladly paid $5.99 or even $6.99 like most other movies.. but the audacity of asking $9.99 for garbage (hot girls) with NO plot (or nudity)???ha. ill just wait until its a 'commercial free' joke on 'TBS Up All Night', 2 months from now.... $9.99... choke on a suitcase full of dicks****follow up. i went for it at $6.99 (months later). I spent $6.99 twice tonight. once for the movie and again for two egg rolls! deep fried, golden brown, i wish you knew how amazing these egg rolls were! anyway, i will remember the egg rolls months from now, the movie... no. on the bright side, id rather feel robbed of $6.99 and raped by a movie, as opposed to feeling raped by an egg roll... :P I've seen deeper content in a 3 min. music video (though they looked similar in scene location). If you're going to make garbage, throw in some random boobs :/"
" Ended abruptly
",2017-08-27 00:00:00,2,I gave this movie 2 stars just because of the castle used in filming. I understand it was a teen flick just like twilight but honestly the plot was very poor and when it ended I couldn't believe this was it. I was waiting for things to get started. Why this movie was made I will never know nor the fact who thought it was a good idea to fund it. Hopefully they at least got their money back.
" I have never felt so conflicted about a movie before!
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,6,"WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSSo I'm of two minds about this film. The cinematography was brilliant, and some of the scenes, particularly the library scene, was well executed. The girl they chose to play Penn was excellent in her role. However, the other characters were so bland, the script writing did not enhance the plot in any way, there were so many lines that were obviously just used as time fillers. Sword and Cross Academy really did feel like a normal boarding school instead of the notorious detention centre it was supposed to be in the book. And the ending was so anti- climatic. There were things to like about it but I can't see myself watching it again anytime soon......I also hated the fact that everything about the curse was revealed at the very beginning of the film instead of subtly throughout like the books do. And they borrowed snippets from the second and third books which really threw me off. Yep, definitely not watching again..."
" Felt like a long trailer
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,2,"The movie had a potential in terms of the plot, but there was too much slow motion, (every minute) which made the plot get smeared for almost 2 hours and the whole movie felt like a long trailer, or like an opening episode of a TV series. And also, I was pretty disappointed from the animations. I think this movie could have been much better, but the damage was already done."
" On Luce Price's first day at the Sword & Cross boarding school, her attention is captured by the strangely familiar Daniel Grigori
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,10,"I loved this movie it shows how love never dies , how you can live a thousand life times and actually find your soulmate in each and every one of them, I saw it with my best friend she loved it , if you read the books you will actually like the movie ,it's been a long time since I saw a movie like this . Hope for a sequel"
" They missed so much out!!!
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,5,"WARNING: Spoilers!!!I saw the trailer for Fallen and I got so excited given the fact that I read the novels and loved them! I considered it to be better than Twilight since the characters were much more dynamic and lively and all seemed to clash with each other in lovable ways! However when I watched the movie I was so disappointed, I mean I have a weakness for light leaks and bokeh effects, but in terms of the narrative, they missed so much out.First of all the characters, I wanted to see Arriane's sexy idgaf attitude who immediately befriends Luce, asking her to cut her hair off etc, but instead she was awkward and almost too relaxed given the fact she calls herself a ""psychopath"" in the novel. Roland wasn't cheeky, and we barely saw his platonic friendship with Arriane. Cam was a huge disappointment considering he was meant to be tall, dark and handsome who has a cutting edge to him (with a tattoo might I add), instead we got a boyish character who doesn't even really seem to know who he's meant to be. Daniel was meant to be rude in the beginning, not caring, in fact having a very irritable mood whenever Luce was about, but he always looked scared in the movie, as if he farted and someone called him out on it. Penn was the only character who I thought was better in the movie than in the novel, she was hilarious and tied the whole thing together. I won't lie when she died in the book I was so happy, she depressed me so much but in the movie I found myself empathising for her, despite the anticlimactic death she was given.Secondly the locations, where the hell was the cemetery and lake? Did no one think that they were pretty important places considering the cemetery was her and Cam's little spot and the lake was a place for her and Daniel? They both symbolised different, but key aspects to the film because of the moments that took place there! You can't just leave important bits out like Luce's best friend! I bet no one remembered her either...Lastly bits of the narrative that just don't add up. Why doesn't Daniel have violet eyes? Why is the swimming pool steaming? Why didn't Trevor combust when he and Luce kissed, instead of setting a whole house on fire? Why isn't it mentioned that Penn's dad was the groundskeeper at Sword and Cross? Why did they make Luce kind of fall for Cam when there were barely any moments they had together, despite the croaky voiced conversations and weird vibes? Why did none of the other characters have a whole minute of dialogue? Why oh why oh why?"
" A Fantasy Romance Film But Not So Romantic
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,5,"Many films about the Angels that live on Earth has been made, and Fallen is one of them but it was wrapped in a teenager romance story. Unfortunately some of the casts were older than the average high school student ages, and became more like college girls or boys.The film was adopted from the romantic fantasy novel of the same name. The plot were too slow, so it made the movie a little bit dull even though the story itself was okay but swayed and unclear. The acting and dialogues were good, also it follows with well done cinematography. Overall it was so so movie, not so great."
" Ehhhh....
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,3,The entire movie seemed rushed to me. Maybe it's because I read the book hours before watching the movie but the entire movie seemed out of order. The relationships between the characters seemed off to me as well. There was no real chemistry as described in the book between Cam and Luce or with Daniel and Luce. Not only were the romantic relationships off but the friendships that Luce was supposed to form weren't there fully. I also didn't like how obvious the movie made it be how all her friends were part of the fallen because in the book we don't know this until the final couple of chapters and it's not really guessed either. So overall I didn't really like this movie although I totally would recommend the book
" Just please don't watch it!
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,1,"The movie's target group is teenagers and therefore I think every movie-maker has a great responsibility what the plot regards as to what certain topics are described. Basically the lesson was; if you have hallucinations and feel depressed, don't you dare cooperate with a psychiatrist, just wait for the angel to save you. The suicide scene was also distasteful, since there is no angel to catch you if you fall from a balcony. Sure, it might sound trivial to the adult reader of this review, but thinking as a 17 year old battling with mental health issues would be troubling and not helpful. On the other hand there was no dialogue whatsoever that actually dealt with something meaningful, other than the main plot line, which is not inspiring and since such movies are so well liked by teenagers, they would be an awesome way to educate the youth on different subject by not losing the appealing main plot."
" Amazing!
",2017-07-19 00:00:00,10,"I was a huge fan of the books, and I had very high expectations for the film! After waiting what felt like ages, the film finally came out. It was not entirely as I had pictured it in my head, but what film is? I only wish it had been longer so I could see more of it, but that's not really a critique. I felt the characters had a good chemistry, and played their part magnificently! All in all, the film was amazing and I have watched it 4 times already. I can't wait for the next one!"
" The most predictable movie I ever saw
",2017-07-16 00:00:00,1,"I can't say anything about the book, but please do not watch this movie. I went into the cinema with low expectations, but I hadn't imagined how bay the movie actually is.There are so many clues spread over the movie that I knew almost from the beginning that some of the students were ""fallen angels"". Sometimes it is so obvious that I wondered if anyone could possibly overlook it. The acting is less than mediocre - I see better acting in some cheap TV series. The characters are unbelievable. The music is boring and monotonous. The plot is sometimes unreasonable and full of clichés.For example: The good looking Aryan is ""good"", but the rocker, the black guy and the nasty purple-haired girl are ""bad"".-- MOVIE SUMMARY --The main character is Luce, a 17 year old girl, who comes to a reform school because of a murder she did not commit. Oddly enough, she refuses to take the medication she needs to stop her hallucinations, even though she believes to be guilty of the murder.Then there's a scene where Luce's religion teacher, Miss Sofia, tells the class about the war between God and Lucifer, and the ""fallen angels"". However, the movie gives no explanation why the war started in the first place. This clue would have been essential to understand what is going on between the angels! Then there are Luce's emotions: She feels oddly connected to Daniel, a blonde student who saves her life twice (!). He tells her a story about a man who does not age and who falls in love every 17 years with the same person. As soon as they kiss, the girl dies and is reborn in another body. It's obvious that they are this couple, but somehow she doesn't get it! She has to break into the library first to find evidence with a face recognition program with a completely unrealistic speed and reliability.Luce also has an affair with Cam, a rocker. But although he is nice and generous to her, she chooses Daniel, who lied to Luce about their past several times.Miss Sophia turns out to be bad. She tried to kill Luce with fire twice, and she kills her room mate. What motivates her remains a mystery.Luce finds out that she is in danger because she isn't baptized. What annoyed me was that nobody comes up with the idea to baptize her. Luce also finds out that she would die if she kissed Daniel. But that doesn't matter, because she is in love.When she kissed Daniel, I really hoped she would die. She behaved so unspeakably stupid that she would have deserved it, I had absolutely no sympathy for her. Daniel should have died, too, because he didn't prevent the kiss. But they both survived somehow. Luce chooses Daniel, even though Cam proved to be the cooler guy with more strength of character and more responsibility. The movie ends corny and with dozens of open questions."
" Fantastic Fantasy Love Story involving fallen angels and reincarnation
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie.I don't understand all the negative reviews.You cannot compare this to Shawshank Redemption or The Godfather movies.This is a fantasy love story movie.If you love love stories or movies about angels or fallen angels, I think you will love this movie.Angels.Reincarnation.Fantasy.Love.I thought this movie is so much better than any ""Twilight"" movie.I hope they will make a sequel.That's why there is not an ""ending"" to this movie. It is meant to be CONTINUED."
" My opinion on the movie
",2017-06-23 00:00:00,10,"It was a great movie! I am not here to underline its mistakes. The reason I am writing this review is to let you know that I really want to see the second movie coming out. I believe that the story is not like the others, like twilight for example. Of course they share some similarities as they are both teenage fantasy, this movie though took my breath away. I have watched it approximately 4 times by now and it still amazes me.There is only one thing left to say, KEEP GOING (pay attention to the details just to be sure) and move on to the second part!!"
" Do not watch
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,1,"I wish that I could give this movie 0 stars but I can't. I've read this book countless times over the years and I loved it... it's one of my favorite book series and I could read it a million more times after this and still be in love with it when I read it. But I'm telling you... DO. NOT. watch this movie if you have read the book, or even if you haven't read the book. They did a crap job on the movie: the actors/actresses were crap, the way they portrayed the story line was crap, they scenes that they did include from the book were so twisted that it's almost as if I didn't even recognize it, and they left out a whole bunch of scenes that I feel needed to be in the movie. I just feel as though they could've done a lot better on the movie and I'm disappointed that I wasted an hour and a half watching this... this monstrosity of a movie and I could've used that hour and a half for a lot of better things. I just did not like this movie and they did a crap job and I wish that they could've done more with this instead of doing what they did. It almost feels as though they put it together quickly and did not even read the book. Do not waste your time on this movie... I wish I didn't."
" Unbearable and redundant
",2017-06-07 00:00:00,2,"Ι read the Fallen series way back when they were first published. I loved the first book. When they announced that it would be made into a film I was so hopeful. Especially with the potential the first book had. It has been years and I thought the movie would never see the light of day. I didn't even know that it was released. There was no marketing whatsoever. But even with crappy marketing it could have been a success. But no... the lackluster acting and dialogue made this unbearable to watch. I doubt that there will be a sequel. It was way to Twilighty. The opening scene (if you can call it that) basically killed the movie for me. That little ""history lesson"" was unnecessary and redundant. All the elements I loved in the book (Luce's friendship with Arriene, Cam being interesting and mysterious, Luce being less of an annoying stalker and much more) were absent from the movie. Overall the movie was way to rushed and really unsubtle in its foreshadowing. Dialogue was overly dramatic and cringy most of the time. I still cannot believe that I wasted my time with this sad excuse of a movie. Now I need to reread Fallen to make sure that I still like the story or if I was in post Twilight feels when I read it."
" fails as a movie
",2017-06-07 00:00:00,2,"I wasn't a big fan of the books (to be honest, I started reading the first book and then couldn't finish it, it was just god awful), but since the first one came out in 2009, I forgot they even existed. The biggest mistake I made going into this movie was that I hardly looked anything up for it, and for some reason failed to connect it to the book I hated so much. I genuinely believed that I was going to see something average at least. Then, as I was entering the cinema, my friend told me it was an adaptation of the ""Fallen"" book, and all I could do was laugh.Right from the start, the similarities with ""Twilight"" are uncanny. It's honestly ridiculous. Firstly, there is a very forced love triangle, where the outcome is nothing short of predictable. This entire movie can be summed up with; ""It's Twilight with angels"", because that's essentially what this is. The two male leads were god awful. The main character's best friend is annoying. I don't even know who the villain is (possibly Satan? I honestly forgot) and they honestly gave it their best to insert every possible cliché in the movie ever. The characters are so frustrating, especially the default male love interest who keeps making dumb and selfish decisions. There is, however, one thing that I liked, and that was the actress who played the main character. Notice how I didn't say that I like the character, because I don't, or her acting in particular, I just feel that she was the only charming cast member with at least some likability surrounding her. It's a shame it was wasted in this god awful movie. This brings me to the ending; there practically isn't one. Of course, they had to have a big overblown CGI battle, but it only lasts for about five minutes and then the movie ends, without any resolution. Worst of all, it's open to a sequel (based on the money they made back and the horrible marketing for this movie, I doubt that's going to happen). Also unfortunately (I guess), the movie doesn't even know how to set up a sequel and leaves tons of stuff unresolved. The result is a flat, unsatisfying ending.In conclusion, I did like the movie better than the book (or what I read from it) and it definitely had potential if it just bothered to be at least a little bit different and keep a consistent tone. At times you could really see this movie trying to be darker than your typical love story for teens, but it just didn't have the guts to steer away from the formula and lose it's target audiences. It's a very boring and forgettable movie, and I wouldn't even recommend it to the fans of the genre."
" A teenager blamed for the death of her friend is sent to a reform school. Where she meets a handsome young stranger who will change her life as she knows it.
",2017-06-06 00:00:00,6,"As a reader and fan of the books and a general film fanatic I would have to say the film was disappointing. Don't get me wrong I understand that its expensive to go all out, but there were small little details that the book reader would have looked for. Although both film and book alike are nothing like this the trailer screams Twilight. With the hardly any proper advertisement for the movie. the film was already at set back. As always when books are converted into movies half of everyone's favorite scenes are gone.The film is based around the belief of fallen angels, and the cause of the fall. Being Daniel's (portrayed by the rather dashing 26 year old Jeremy Irvine) persistent love for 'Luce' Lucinda Price (acted by the stylish Addison Timlin) a stubborn set troubled teenager. Luce is curious on unraveling the mystery behind her recollection of Daniel who denies their connection. The most disappointing features not included in the book for me was Daniel's eyes and the red scarf because isn't that one of the main reason she looks at him? Because he was the only bit of color in the bleak dull environment? But what will discovering the truth do to Luce? Will it destroy her forever, or make her fight back stronger?"
" Ending a little Rushed, Lacked Exposure, Good Portrayal - Much as Imagined
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,8,"So waited and waited and it never released here in Australia, just managed to stumble across the trailer a year after completion as was following it before production started but figured with he cast it would make theater's so no need to chase it. Mistake. Potentially could have had bigger turnover had it been in theater's etc.As for the movie, I thought it was good, a little rushed at end but not in any means bad and was fairly true and actors etc was good. Shadows were as I imagined exactly and so were a few things. Its hard with books as we get so much detail and detail to interpret in our own way so you are automatically set up for some disappointments, but was very happy with portrayal, just a smidge rushed at end. But a lot was to be fitted. Hope they make next ones. If not let Netflix save it like they did Mortal Instruments as they can string it out and give it the detail attention. Either way want to see this to the end."
" Very disappointed.
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,1,"I am horrified, truly. The books were amazing, I have read them multiple times, and the least I expected from this movie was that it stays even a little bit true to book. Imagine my surprise when I watched this piece of garbage. I am sorry but this is almost like an insult for the author and the books.All the details were off. Different scenes and events from other books in the series were jumbled together, and even that I could have managed but they also got them wrong. this was all wrong. I get artistic freedom and all that but to turn something beautiful into this horrendous piece of garbage which only confuses you with all the bits and pieces which are put together as well as 4 year old would have done is just bad movie making. You could have even tried. It felt awkward and rushed, the acting was sub par and I truly wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I am sorry but..It's bad. Please, do read the books and don't judge them by this movie."
" poorly done but cast is good
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,5,"the movie cast was actually good. Acting is way better than Twilight. The love story was sincere and convincing but what is that poorly done script? I mean seriously? It is like they cut the movie when you can't even tell the ending is there. What an amateur work as they say ""oh times up cut!"" or the director simply were bored of shooting? During all movie, I was puzzled story is confusing and they wrapped it up with a made up ending."
" nice fantasy movie.. unfinished though..
",2017-05-22 00:00:00,7,"good movie, with the kind of fantasy that someone who liked twilight or vampire movies will like.I haven't read the book though.. but it keeps you on your toes. However, it was unfinished.. It definitely needs a second part.. You can't really understand entirely the scenario.. a lot of details are missing which i think someone that had read the book would had understand better."
" Not What I expected
",2017-05-19 00:00:00,5,"Loved the books! But the movie was not very well produced... Even the Mortal Instruments, that also had a lot of very bad reviews... was better than this book adaptation. The cast is good, they are perfect for the roles. The whole movie leaves a very incomplete feeling, it leaves you with the feeling that you were supposed to see something happening that actually did not happen. It did not felt like a movie, it felt like a long trailer."
" Cam is the savior
",2017-05-13 00:00:00,7,"I have read the books and honestly... don't know what to think. I don't think movie is a total success. There were lots of other things they could do and they have cut many awesome scenes from the book. This movie wouldn't be worth watching if Cam (Harrison Gilbertson) wasn't in it. Cam totally saved this movie although there are not enough scenes with him. However, I can't wait for the next part. I truly hope Cam will appear more. According to the books, he should. I recommend you read the books before watching the movie."
" not what expected (big fan of the books) but want more
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,8,"i've been a big fan of the books for a looong time and the movie was not as i expected, they took away a lot of things, put in stuff that didn't belong in this part of the story, didn't care for the little details with big importance and worst of all i didn't feel the story-line flow... but i kind of get it, movies are shorter versions of original stories and it's not possible to give the same feeling and because of that, I would like a sequel... really hated of happened to City of Bones"
" For Young Teenagers Only
",2017-05-07 00:00:00,5,"The teenager Lucinda ""Luce"" Price (Addison Timlin) is brought to the Sword and Cross reformatory by her parents to comply with a court order since she was accused for the death of her boyfriend Trevor (Leo Suter) in a fire. However Luce blames shadows for the incident and is considered lunatic. On the arrival, Luce is instructed about the rules and regulations in the school and has contact with the rebel student Cameron ""Cam"" Briel (Harrison Gilbertson) and then with Arriane Alter (Daisy Head). She visits the library and is welcomed by Miss Sophia (Joely Richardson) that gives books for her and is confronted by the weird Molly Zane (Sianoa Smit-McPhee). Then she befriends the student Pennyweather ""Penn"" (Lola Kirke) and she feels attracted by Daniel Grigori (Jeremy Irvine), who saves her from a falling statue of an angel. On the next days she is courted by Cam and Daniel and has flashbacks from Trevor's accident and an apparently her past life. She also has a class with Miss Sophia about the war of the angels and the falling angels. When Penny and Luce research with their friend Todd Hammond (Chris Ashby) about Daniel, they find a XIX century picture of Luce and Daniel. However there is a fire in the library caused by shadows and Todd dies. What is the secret of the Sword and Cross?""Fallen"" is another silly romance indicated for young teenagers and fans of ""Twilight"" only. Adults will probably find it desipient since after so many centuries angels should be more mature. The screenplay is not good and there is no explanation why the fallen angels live at Sword and Cross. The concept of angels with lightened wings is original and the soundtrack is very beautiful. And that is all. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): Not Available"
" Just Awful
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,1,"Awful, just plain awful. Don't watch this for any reason. It is not even worthy of watching it at home in TV. The book was bad but the movie is much worse. Of course it's an adaptation of a YA book but a bad one at that (this is not The Hunger Games). The script is so bad, it's hard to watch. Whatever you do, don't watch this. You've been warned."
" Worth watch
",2017-05-03 00:00:00,10,why this movie got a very low rating?? not as good as novel?come on all movies made from novel always lack a feeling when compare to novel version but this doesn't mean this movie is bad .This deserve more than 5.9 :(.The ending is a bit fast.Whatever looking forward the next movie .waiting waiting
" The Final Result
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,3,"Yes , it's so disappointing to watch a whole movie while nothing happens and you keep telling your self , wait man it's gonna be interesting now , but unfortunately , the movie ended while nothing happened , anyway to be so realistic and fair , The Movie Is so Bad , but also it have 3 amazing things 1- The Background Music Is A Heart-moving , so deep and awesome 2- The Actors choices are pretty good , they really Look like an angels 3- The Light Wings Is SO SO SO Beautiful"
" Book-To-Film Adaptation
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,6,"I've been a fan of the book series for years and waited so long to have this film be made. It may not be exactly the same as the book as some scenes were changed. The low-budget look of the film makes it come out more like an episode from a television series. Some people complain how low-budget it looks, but I don't actually mind it. It looks more Twilight- ish in ways. There are scenes from the book they should have put in. It probably would have been better off as a mini series than one film with so much left out. It did feel rushed. I am happy with this film but it could have been better."
" Feels like a lame YouTube fan film
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,3,"Fallen is a movie based on a book by Lauren Kate. It should be the first movie in the series but since there were a lot of distribution problems, I doubt this will become a franchise. The book could have been better, but it was decent. Flawed, but decent. This is just kinda lame.I like how it tried to keep the moody and Gothic atmosphere, but it all just felt amateurish and low budget, I couldn't take it very seriously. The first two thirds are a bit slow paced and then the last third feels so rushed, you don't really get to know anything. You just get a lot of exposition, things just happen but nothing interesting, so the climax just comes off as forced. The one plus of the movie is Lola Kirke as the geeky best friend Penn. She seems to be the only one who actually got into this and tried to make something good. She stole every scene she was in. She's the most memorable character of the movie and she's not even one of the leads. The lead actress is pretty much Kristen Stewart in Twilight. There's really not much difference. The rest of the characters, they are just there. Even that is hard to believe because you just don't notice them.This was the opportunity to improve the story, but it just made the whole thing worse. I'm not even sure if fans will like this."
" disappointment
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,1,"It was such a disappointment, I've read the books more times than i can count and I loved them so much, but the film didn't live up to the books, it was all done to fast, everything bottled up in 90 minutes, it wasn't enough. Director and screenwriter of this movie, READ THE DAMN BOOKS BEFORE YOU MAKE A MOVIE!!! It's a pity, it could have been amazing."
" WTF was this??
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,2,"this movie is for teenagers who have the patience to watch one season of a supernatural, baptized suspense plot and could have hanged on till the next season starts. but unfortunately this movie is just 2 episodes of any generic supernatural teemed TV series, if this was ever aired in a 3rd world country, the theater would have been burned down."
" Really bad
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,2,"This was so bad I forced my self to give it 2. Bad acting, bad story,characters are flat and uninteresting, idea of fallen angels and the reason for being on the earth wouldn't buy even preschool kids... It was like this film was made by bunch of teen twilight fans, and made very badly. Waste of time."
" Who is this movie targeting?
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,3,"Before I watched this movie, I didn't read reviews about it, nor did I pay much attention about kinda poor rating. I only knew director S.Hicks from his ""Hearts in Atlantis"", which I quite liked at that time. And for that reason, I didn't wanted to be influenced by other opinions before seeing Fallen. Here it goes, my opinion...OK, I realize this movie wasn't made for me. Meaning, if you're male above 40's (or above any age?), don't watch it, because it's just silly. I can't imagine even teenager would buy such story nowadays. As for women/girls of any age, if you like seeing romantic fantasy (say, angels) movies, maybe you watch again ""Ghost"" (1990) or ""City of Angels"" (1998) movie -after all these years, both will leave bigger impact.I rate Fallen with 3 stars -truth to be told, Fallen is better than watching commercials."
" loved it
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,10,"I thought the movie was great and yes there were changes but that what made the movie so interesting to watch. I mean I think some are disappointed because they were just hoping to see the book in a movie exactly with the same events.. but I don't believe that would have been interesting because we would have known every event in the movie.. this way it's much more interesting as a watcher to grab your attention plus as a fan of the novel it was fun to see the same story with new things around. I Seriously loved the movie, totally planning on watching it again and I would absolutely watch a squeal. the only thing that was wrong with the movie that it was too short in my opinion they could have added an extra 30 or 20 min maybe for some nice detailed events."
" bull-spit
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,6,"I don't understand I lucky found out that the made this book into a movie by pure accident from an online website and they did this with a few other books into movies, I don't understand since it has a huge fans base, Advertise this stuff and you might have a better turnout, even though they completely mess everything up in the movies we fans still like to see and then complain but least we would know that it has been turn into a movie. let me guess since it bombed the rates they won't make the second book into a movieVampire academy, shadow hunters, fallen.are the three book movies you all screwed up and didn't tell anymore that you made them into a movie.. get your crap together Hollywood"
" Beautiful and excellent.
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,10,"If you've read the books first as I have you may be a bit disappointed. Though if you watch it a second time, the movie grows on you. You should never compare a book to a movie. Never. They will always disappoint you. But if you overlook the book slightly you will love the movie as I have. It's quick paste but beautiful, breathtaking, emotional and an excellent movie. One of my favorite scene in the movie was actually never in the book, the fencing scene. It was EPIC, loved it so much! To see the emotion from the actors play out so well. You could feel the magnetism and sorrow. Stunning scene. I highly recommend the movie! I would think a lot of people would love it if they just saw past the book a little. No movie can compete with a books detail and time-frame, it's impossible and I think this movie has done a wonderful job with what they could. Love love love it, hoping there will be movies of the whole series."
" Fallen fanatic
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,7,Having read the book more times than i can count i was really worried about how the film would turn out. Even though the scenes have been changed and and it doesn't match the book i was still hooked and could see the imagined story unfold before my eyes. the background story was still there even if the book wasn't (which to be honest it wasn't) i would still watch again and i would still read the book again and love both. a film cannot be perfect or be true to a fans liking but if u haven't read the book its an interesting watch and possibly love.
" Good, but not great
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,8,"I have been waiting for this movie for what feels like forever. Unfortunately it didn't live up to expectations, but do movies ever? I think that the first movie of the series would have been the most difficult to create because of all the background information that the writer and directer have to stick somewhere. I believe if there was a second it would be significantly better, which is why I give 8 stars. Hopefully we will see the second book, Passion, created into a movie that is able to live up to the standards."
" Terrible
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,3,"This movie has ruined the story. I have read all the books and if I must be entirely honest, I didn't expect this to be a good movie. The acting was very bad and in general the movie was very low quality. I'm very disappointed. There were a lot of things altered and missing from the original story, and certain important facts are also missing. An entire book was fit in an hour and a half, with everything cut short and simplified in the worst way possible."
" not good enough
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,2,"Haven't read the book, but this surely felt like one of those movies that try to represent the YA books on the screen, but fail so badly that the movie ends up looking like a badly made TV movie. Not that the special effects were bad. Neither were the performances. However, the story lacked of so many things... The romance tried to create a love triangle, which was eventually silly, and get a strong love is eternal feeling out of it, which never happened. The story started okay, with the girl attending a school for youngsters who had committed some short of crime. There she meets a gorgeous blond guy, whom she gets the feeling that she knows from somewhere. It turns out that he is an angel who has fallen because he has chosen love instead of a side. I only wish that the story had at least a conclusion. It had no main body, no strong romance, actually no logic and eventually no ending. So 2 out of 10."
" Think they left out half the script or movie or something.
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,3,"So i am guessing you have to have read the books to like this movie or rely understand what is going on, It was just so poorly done. The script is so weak i felt bad for the actors as the main female basically half the time just stands in front of the love interest with nothing to say. he then later has to apologist for being mean when really he has not even spoken to her. What this film does however is prove how important a good book to film adapter is and that we should stay clear of the person who converted this one. What i feel really sad about is the cast and how i am sure they thought they were going to be super famous and set after this first installment. But as anyone who has half a brain who has watched this can see there will be no second installment of the fallen series."
" No end, no story, what the heck did I just watch?
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,1,"Movie was rushed and did not have an end. Did she survive? When the movie ended, all I was thinking was WTF. What happened to the friend? Did the angels bring her back to life? They said they would take care of her. What happened to the girl? Did she survive? The movie left me with more question than answers. The movie could have been so much better. There was too much focus on on it being artsy, not enough on the story line. The plot had no end."
" Okay
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,5,The movie could have been much better it seemed to short And rushed there really wasn't a story line they changed a lot from the story warning ⚠️ if u didn't read the book don't see the movie u would be confused other then the cute guys I have read the first book it was a good read but I did find some similar parts to twilight I figured I'd give the movie a chance because I actually didn't watch twilight until the 2nd movie was set to come out but when I seen it I was hooked but this movie I wasn't really captured by it the acting to was not very good and the lead female wasn't even that pretty to me I actually thought the one who played pen was much prettier then Luce well anyway it was just okay that's it I think I'd just buy the movie when it comes out to have with the book that's it
" I like the movie!
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,10,"I read the books, and the movie didn't disappoint me at all. Is a shame that didn't have marketing promotion, I was so exited when I learned there's going to be a movie. Of course no movie is going to be exactly like the books, but the adaptation of the novel to movie is good. The casting was good to me as well. Two thumbs up!!"
" Worth the watch
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,10,"As a fan of the books, I've waited for a while to see the movie, and even tho' they could have done a few things better, and I wasn't thrilled with their choice of actor for Cam, I still feel like they did and overall good job. I'm really happy I got to see it and I hope they really do make that sequel. Bummer that for some reason it wasn't shown in cinemas, just kinda feels like they had some bad luck with the advertisement for the movie. Either way it's definitely worth the watch, it might not amaze you but it will not leave you high and dry."
" Great for teens
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,6,"Like all book-to-film adaptations, there are going to be a few discrepancies. Personally, I believe that they didn't do a terrible job, but it definitely could have been better. Apart from the lighting being awful at times, the beginning was slow and drawn out, causing the climax and the most interesting parts to be rushed. Thinking back to when I was a teenager, I probably would have loved this movie. As an adult, I didn't think it was so horrible that I regret watching it but it also isn't something I'd watch again anytime soon."
" A messy romance
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,7,"I didn't know the books and didn't read them either. So, it is with a new and clear sight I saw this film. Firstly, I like the actress (much more than Kirsten Stewart in Twilight). She's pretty, not proud, tortured and the actress plays well. I like Daniel's actor too. He is charismatic, tortured as well and enigmatic. However, Cam seems very young and not very strong for me, so, I can't feel any hesitation between Daniel and him in Luce's heart. For me, it is obvious that Daniel is much better and more interesting than Cam. I confess that I was a little lost in this story with fallen angels. I am French and I was very worried to not understand what happened with the devil and the angels. I read others reviews and I realized that it's not clear even for English people. Nonetheless, I like the story with angels, cursed love ... I began to read the books (in English of course) and I look forward to discovering what are the differences between the film and the book."
" An excellent adaptation that does justice to the book.
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,8,"Fallen IT'S AN EXCELLENT ADAPTATION pretty attached to the book. To highlight which has reference of the following parts. DURING ALMOST THE MOVIE WAS HAND IN THE MOUTH AND IT WAS ME Impossible STIFLE THE SHOUTING. They summarized a book that, personally, is quite extensive, in an hour and a half movie. Enough time for they got me to take care of the characters. I would have preferred that Was a little longer, the events happen in the blink of an eye. I NEED TORMENT ADAPTATION."
" Obsessed!!
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,10,"I just finished watching the movie after YEARS of waiting for it, after reading the books many times, the first book is my favorite, so I wanted it to be truly special so I can watch it over and over again! And it delivered!! Such an amazing movie! They brought my imagination to life ten folds!! I'm hard fan-ing right now! I feel about ten years younger!"
" Better than the book
",2017-03-10 00:00:00,8,"I am very much into the ""Fantasy/Romance"" kind of story line.. Read and reread the Twilight books and still continue to binge watch the Saga series due to the depth in which their story conveys. (This series does have its similarities but with a fresh take on forbidden love and its journey to obtaining it).With this said, I was very much excited to have another dreamy world to escape to. Starting off with the books.. Not a series I will ever reread again! Poorly written, lacks any type of chemistry or substance and just a complete bore! Yes, I was curious to know how the outcome of the ever fleeting love of Luce and Daniel would evolve but instead got a complete filler of abysmal nothingness and then The End! SO to the Movie.. I actually thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Usually book to film adaptations are lackluster and just wrong, so this left little excitement to the dreamy realm, but I wish they had come out with the movie first! Or just the movie! ..and no book. The movie doesn't follow the book in story telling line order which is quite alright. They also allowed room for their own interpretation of Lauren Kates books. Which I feel they had to because it was just awful. The movie actually made more sense and has a captivating flow rather than just spitting the complete plot in the last chapter or scene. The movie keeps you wanting to know more about their mystery. The characters were well cast and I can see them playing those roles in real life. Movie Luce has a lot more gumption than Book Luce which made for a more interesting watch. I also don't mind the depiction of the wings. A Feathery Frock would have been way too cheesy and I feel they gave a refreshing view on how angel wings can be portrayed. The ending was quite quick and abrupt (but most saga movies are-how else would they keep you coming back to the box office?)The soundtrack to this movie is superb actually. Definitely fits the scenes and I would listen to the songs on their own. Please release a Track list!"
" Great film!
",2017-03-10 00:00:00,10,"I watched the film first this time round. The cast are suited to their roles and played them out perfectly, I could definitely feel the passion in the air. I hope they'll be a number two as the film was short and left me wanting to see more. There is plenty going on in the film. I like how the director has gave his interpretation of the book there isn't nothing I would change, apart from it being too short as mentioned above."
" Just Bad Luck!
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,6,"I am not sure what pushed back the release, why it wasn't really advertised, or why no larger production companies ever got on board, but it seems like bad luck. The film itself lacked much dialogue. I read the first three books in this series when they came out and found this film to be similar enough to the books. (For example, I believe this film is more similar to the book than the Percy Jackson adaptions). Because of the lack of good writing and special effects, the movie felt unsupported like a baby bird that has fallen from the nest. The most seasoned actor, Joely Richardson, played her part well along with Addison Timlin (Luce) and Daisy Head (Arriane). The rest of the cast seemed easily replaceable. I feel that with adequate writers and directors, a television series would have been better suited for this book series (given its extensive nature); however, this film was lacking any true direction. The soundtrack and score felt outdated and could have fit easily into a 90s horror film. The whole film felt like it combated bad luck and lagged timing. For what it was, I would give it a weak six. Others compared the film to Twilight, and I agree with that sentiment; though, I don't think this was quite that bad. It is worth a watch for fans of Young Adult films like Twilight or shows on the CW network and Freeform network."
" it's basically like Twilight, but with angels, and a lot more confusing
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,4,"I read the books, it's basically like Twilight, but with angels, and a lot more confusing. It starts off like a nice romance with the girl falling in love with a bad boy and stuff, then weird stuff happens, and what you find out at the end of the series is very confusing. The actor playing the guy seems to be too older looking then how the story would portray him so that is quite confusing. The actual movie feels like a school project, there doesn't seem to be anything impressive. The acting isn't that impressive either. The animations are weak."
" Subpar and poorly produced
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,2,"Ι read the Fallen series years ago and when it was announced it was finally being made into a film adaptation i thought it would come sooner. The book rights have been optioned ever since the first book came out in 2009. Fallen started filming in 2014 and after two years of silence and everyone thinking it would be scrapped eventually, the film came out in a few countries without any promotion or marketing. A movie that it is essentially released on its own cannot be a universal success. I'd say the lack of proper marketing set this saga up. I don't believe a second film will see the green light. Aside from the terrible release strategy, the theme of this series feels too dated for 2017. The trailer of the movie was very Twilight from beginning to end. To be fair, the first book has a lot of Twilight elements but let's remember that the book came out when Twilight was the It movie of the late 2000s and books similar to this story sold like hot cakes. The movie and the book are somewhat similar but i wouldn't call it faithful to the original material. The castle they used as Sword and Cross is very beautiful which is part of the problem. The movie spends too much screen time with beauty shots of the school and forest scenes filled with smoke effects to set the mood. I cannot recall how many times i saw drone shots of the school being surrounded by chunks of smoke. Like, we get it. They also used smoke/steam inside the swimming pool which didn't make much sense since it wasn't a hot bath or a sauna. Addison Timlin as Luce is fine considering i am not a fan of Luce in the books. She is extremely restricted due to the script. Like every character in this movie she is reduced to brooding silences and looking sad. One of the biggest flaws of the book was translated into the screen unfortunately and the side characters are given zero time to unfurl and develop. They are in the background, throwing a couple of lines and then we never see them again. They are so insignificant i feel sorry for the actors. Jeremy Irvine is a one dimensional Edward clone who thankfully isn't as rude and condescending as he was in the books but he has zero charm. He is either avoiding Luce or picking a fight with the other walking cliché, Cam. Cam was one of the most interesting, if not THE most interesting character of this series. He is supposed to be popular, charming, fun and sexy. In the movie we get a young Leo lookalike dressed in leather, pretending to be dangerous but doesn't do anything remotely dangerous to cause any attention. He is forced and pretentious, hidden behind a so called mysterious persona which doesn't offer anything. The actor got so caught up in Cam's demon nature that he omitted everything that made him an intriguing character. Also the attempt for a love triangle is so blatant it's hard not to laugh about the lack of substance. Luce has visions about her past lives with Daniel yet she's canoodling with Cam because no one knows why. As soon as the truth is revealed she forgets about Cam and she immediately chooses Daniel without any buildup or good reason other than the film coming to an end. The only character that is actually trying to pierce the screen and get out of their box is Penn. She is geeky, sweet, funny and it is quite sad her end was so anticlimactic. Lola Kirke was really likable as Penn and if the saga continues, she is something to be missed. Let's move on to the things that hardly made sense like the atrocious script that ruined whatever potential this movie had. The script consists of awkward phrases and none interaction. Whenever there is actual dialogue the scene ends. It was like the director wanted the characters to wander around aimlessly and let the audience guess about the story. The dialogue is partially and even at times, completely overlooked as if it has no significance in a story. When the story is about to take off the film is over. 85% of the screen time is devoted to Luce's backstory and religion mythology which has way too many scenes. Learning about angels in a reform school? Why would they need to learn how to fence? Is it safe to give weapons to kids with psychological issues? We also keep hearing that everyone is dangerous and a troublemaker but the students seem perfectly normal. The surveillance is laughable since they are able to throw loud parties in the woods unsuspected and everyone comes and goes as they please. In the final scene Penn is murdered, Luce is screaming and Daniel breaks through a glass dome but no one hears anything. The production for a fantasy film is poor. The wings look small and unconvincing, the entire rooftop scene is shot inside a studio and the transitions from scene to scene are terrible. There is a motorcycle scene that I still wonder how it ended up in the film and what purpose it serves. There's also too much blurriness in certain parts that can be annoying to the eye. Instead of spending money in smoke effects and ridiculous studio filmed motorcycle scenes with fans they could have done a better job with the editing and the screenplay. The flow is chunky because of the short screen time. 400 pages squeezed into 1 hour and 30 minutes and the result is rushed, badly produced, and forgettable. Fallen could have stood a chance if the production company had tried harder."
" Not sure how I really feel.
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,6,I read these books in anticipation for the movie. I've been waiting forever for the movie to release. I finally watched it and as with Vampire Academy they tried WAY too hard to make this something it wasn't. They changed many things and brought in things from the other books. They barely showed the other characters. It was just a big mess to me. I mean maybe if I hadn't have read the books I may have enjoyed it a little more but I would have had SOOOOOOOO many more questions if I didn't know what was going on already. I doubt it will get any sequels due to the fans of the books not enjoying the movie. I would like to see if they could get better as the Twilight movies did but I don't think they will take that chance.
" Would have been better if...
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,7,"I have not read the series and I like it that way when it comes to films because I don't like to be comparing the scenes and debt of acting to the movie I see in my head when I read.With that said, there is this ongoing desire when it comes to YA (Young Adult) Romances adapted to film to have this great hope that the first will be a commercial success like Twilight and then they will adapt the rest of the series to film. It is rare to have that kind of hit on your hands even twilight was a flux, because the acting was stilted and no chemistry between the costars regardless of them having a relationship. The hype and the fact the books were already beloved as a series that even if it sucked the fans were determined. With that said, this film would have been better if they combine the series and made one great film, then come back with a sequence which could be a new unread addition to the story if it was a hit. As it stands it feels uncompleted and leaves you wanting. Hollywood has been proved to be unreliable to their movie goers by not completing beloved series romances adapted to film. Now last I heard Disney bought the right to do all 3 films, so one can only hope it won't end up in list below.For example: The Mortal Instrument Series I Am Number Four ""Lorien Legacies"" series Vampire Academy The CovenantI suggest it's best to be like me and wait on reading the books after you see all the movies so each movie can float on its own merits."
" Horrible
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,1,"I have read this book for year after year. I read the whole serious numerous times. But I have never been so disappointed in my life watching this movie, It was completely ruined. I waited a long time for this movie and now that I have seen it I wish I didn't because it is nothing like the book, poor acting and graphics and scenes that were completely different including the end scene. I said what the hell at least 4 times a minute."
" Honestly disappointed
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,5,"Book to movie adaptations usually aren't fantastic so I had low expectations for this movie. At the beginning it looked like I was going to end up pleased. The characters were enjoyable, Arriane was exciting and I was looking forward to seeing some more character development with her, as I was with Roland, and Cam, and Molly, and.... honestly every other character in the movie, with the exception of Luce. But it didn't come, even Cam got a maximum of 20 minutes of screen time, Roland was probably there for about 5 minutes and said a total of about 10 words and a few ""wooo""'s. This movie honestly needed to be another 30 minutes at least, not to mention cutting out some of Luces brooding. I had low expectations already, but once I got to the end they were even lower. It had so much potential and unfortunately most of the movie was Luce and Daniel brooding which wouldn't have been a problem if there had've been an extra 30 minutes of jam packed action at the end involving all the other characters. This wasn't the case at all, and the ending totally ruined the entire movie. I still had hope for this movie at this point, and I was looking forward to seeing some actual conversations between a few of the characters, and it just ended. Obviously this is only the first book, but I have doubts about another movie being made, and I really don't think that was a satisfying ending. A real shame because I think there was so much potential, especially if the post processing had've been better. A lot of the time the words didn't match the scene on the screen. Super irritating and definitely made the movie feel unprofessional.TLDR; Hardly any character interactions, supporting characters just stood there in the background of classrooms, total brood-fest of Luce and Daniel, at least 30 minutes too short, unprofessional post processing"
" A lot like Twilight
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,4,"I planned to go to the movies with my mom and sister and my sister isn't really a big fan of book-to-movie adaptations so I thought she would hate it and didn't even bother to ask her. However, she asked me!It's a nice movie if you like the kind of stuff like Twilight, City of Bones and maybe even The Vampire Diaries. It's a fantasy and has somewhat love triangle although the story never fully explains why both guys want the same girl.The movie starts of very well and is obviously a teen movie, but seems like something anyone would watch (and enjoy) if it came from TV on Saturday when nothing else would. However the ending is left very open, like they're not even trying to get everything in one - or even on two films. I don't know how many books there are, but I'm guessing three or maybe even four.Not my first choice, but it'll do. Probably nicer to watch as a binge watch when all the movies are out."
" A long time delayed for...this?
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,4,"I went to the cinema with no big expectation about how good this gonna be. Tbh, this film didn't get a good review in my country, same as the other countries's movie reviewers. This didn't get much attention for a movie goers, so here is my review about Fallen :I have read the book, it was fine. But that's it, nothing more than the ""fine"" word to describe it. I think there's too much descriptive about the S&C Gothic aura, and too fast for the ending of the first book. Same thing happens to the movie. But, I think the movie is better than the book (since I don't like the plot on the book, too slow). In the movie you can see how dynamic Luce is, not too passive as she is in the book. But, too bad for the other characters that should be more involved in the storyline. They have more potential to make the story more attractive and interesting. As a filmgoers, I think they're too focus on Luce and Daniel's past without considering the other characters. I mean, Gabbe, Arriane, Molly, and Rolland didn't get much plot for develop their characters and they looked like only as a extra-role. Even though, we knew those character in the book have a lot of part.P.S : I think the main problem is the distributors which not-so-active promoting the film, plus I just think Jeremy Irvine failed to catch an attractiveness to young girls or even Daniel's character as he is described in the book. But, plus thing is : I love the song on the bon fire party, and still looking for the tracklist of it. It's really catchy, seriously."
