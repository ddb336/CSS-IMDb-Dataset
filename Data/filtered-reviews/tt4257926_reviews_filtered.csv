" Strong movie
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,9,"I like this type of movies, with hope, love, that teach us something. The best part was at the end, when they showed that small sacrifice of random people made a difference. Really strong and moving story."
" Good but really hard to watch
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,5,Has a good message but throughout the entire duration of the movie you watch a little girl in terrible pain.
" A miracle it sure is
",2021-02-26 00:00:00,6,Miracles From Heaven is a 2016 Christian Drama based on the true story of a 10 year old girl named Annabel Beam who suffers from an incurable disease and has months left to live. So her mother Christy would stop at nothing to save her little girl even if it means travelling to Boston to find a cure. But will Annabel get cured or will she be saved by God?.Jennifer Garner is a very good actress. I've always loved her since 13 Going On 30 and have been watching her evolve ever since. The climax to this film was very far fetched as spoilers Annabel falls off a tree and is stuck there for hours unconscious. But when she miraculously recovered and was cured from her disease thanks to God who she claims met her when she left her lifeless body for a while and he cured her. Half the time I was thinking was this a hoax or as what the film suggests a miracle from heaven.Queen Latifah and Eugenio Debrez stars.Decent film
" Inspiring and mesmerising
",2021-02-19 00:00:00,10,"Don't listen to naysayers, the movie and the story is heartwarming"
" Rubbish
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,1,If god existed why would he have allowed this movie to be made?
" Wonderful family movie!
",2021-02-08 00:00:00,10,"Our family of seven with children ages 7 to 13 really loved this movie!
So uplifting! Great storyline! Really encouraging! Would recommend to all family and friends!"
" Moh
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,10,The best movie in 2016 and very sad and I love the movie
" This is not 10/10 movie at all.
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,3,"While the first 80% of the movie are ok to watch, the other 20% are utter BS. Who in their right mind would give this a 10/10? Pure JO material for religious fanatics. The ending made me feel that I just a wasted a lot of my time."
" Perfect.
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,10,"I believe in Miracles and no one can't believe in them except the dead. Our existence here is a miracle!
It's very inspiring<3 I admire spiretual science. Love god, myself and humanity"
" Very well done
",2020-12-18 00:00:00,10,Excellent movie. Amazing acting by all actors. Emotional and heart touching. Based on true story so must watch
" Great story with an agenda
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,4,Beautiful story tainted by agenda. Whenever you watch based on a true story movie you never know what's actually true. Turns out there a pitoval character and subplot created for the movie that reeks of religious sanctimony. The character doesn't believe in God and in the end things go very badly for him. Had nothing to d ok with the real life story. With that said the movie as a whole is very good and done well.
" Miracles happen
",2020-11-12 00:00:00,9,"An unbelievable story, but sometimes miracles happen!"
" Very good movie!
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,8,"I watched this movie and found it to be very interesting! The story itself is very pleasant, but the message is GREAT! It was not the miracle that occurred for Anna that impressed me. What made me think of the movie as special, is not the account of this miracle, but the faith she had herself! Because of this one little girl, she brought her father to come to know the Lord and understand that he is real! So for me it was not Anna's miracle that makes me a believer in what happend to her, but her faith that impressed me!"
" A true story
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,10,"Miracle ... or how to remain optimistic. I won't say that you have to believe in God because faith is omnipresent in this film. But, whatever you are going through, because of this film, you will know that you will never be alone anymore. It is a wonderful film which shows you that you should never give up. It is impossible not to cry but what a beautiful film. The actors are amazing. Jennifer Garner is perfect in this role.What else can I say ? It is a incredible story and I just can tell you that you should see this film."
" But really... are they worthy?
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,2,"Another of those ""are they worthy?"" type films.Little girl develops a rare genetic disease and America's health system is broken. So family (almost?) go bankrupt. It's all down to the sanctimonious beliefs that hopefully bring order out of chaos. I mean... they're worthy right?I wish Hollywood would stop presenting America's broken system and the few people lucky enough to escape it as a ""feel good story""."
" Love this movie
",2020-08-17 00:00:00,10,"It is a gem of a true story! With quality acting and cinematography. It's prayerful, and realistically portrays Christian faith experiences (trust, forgiveness, doubt, anger, humility, conversion, love, gratitude). If you're a person of faith, this is a must see. If you're not, perhaps this family's witness is one you need to see for yourself."
" Beautifully crafted
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,7,Such a light hearted movie with a good screenplay & a well written story . Well actually it's based on true events & that's what makes the movie special .This movie focuses on miracles that can happen in your life that can change . I actually believe that luck also plays its part in it .
" Miracles
",2020-08-02 00:00:00,10,"Miracles that are God way of letting us know, He is here."
" Garbage Christian Tripe
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,1,What a surprise. Bad acting. Garbage premise. If you want to watch a movie about myths I suggest Clash of the Titans.
" Ok until....
",2020-07-01 00:00:00,6,"Nothing against faith. Nothing against hope. Nothing against miracles. However, don't you think the ending was too much? It was good untill..."
" I'm not one for Christian movies
",2020-06-01 00:00:00,8,"But this is one of two exceptions (The other being A Question of Faith). The acting is good in this movie. I also appreciated the short but sweet appearance of Queen Latifah (who I believe is underappreciated as an actress) and the overall joyful feeling that comes at the end. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the constant mention of Christianity, but hey, it doesn't ruin the movie."
" Good family viewing!
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,10,"One of the few films in recent years that is good enough for a family to sit and watch together. The acting is professional, and, seeing that there are so many kids on the screen, this is amazing! The kids act as well as any of the adults! Also, the subject of religion is dealt with in a tasteful, respectful way, leaving no doubt that the characters believe in God, but go through their doubts and struggle with faith, just like most of us. I would not hesitate to allow a child to see this for any reason.I am not ashamed to say this film had me, a 68yo US Navy retiree, in tears more than once, not only for the scenes showing the girl's pain, but for the difficulties the parents went through, as well."
" Well done tear jerker
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,10,Very inspirational movie. Good acting and a true story. The horrors of what parents go thru for their ill kids. And how faith plays a part during it all. Very emotional movie.
" Fly butterfly...
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,9,"I will only say this; if you have kids of your own you will cry to the point where the floor is completely filled with tissues. My eyes are so swollen right now, I can hardly see what I'm writing :D"
" Don't let the title fool you: this story is grounded in the tough realities of faith.
",2020-03-21 00:00:00,10,"Based on the trailer and the title and the producer parentage it partially shares with the dreadful ""Heaven Is for Real,"" my expectations were rather low. But it may be the best Christian film I have ever seen-certainly in the top five.Why? Because it felt real. The people acted and talked and felt like real people do.Jennifer Garner is powerful in the central role, and the entire cast is well chosen and well directed by Patricia Riggen, who also helmed the highly acclaimed ""Under the Same Moon"" and the underrated and underwatched ""The 33.""Try to avoid seeing the trailer, because it tells you most of the plot points-yet it does not reveal the actual story. The title is misleading and might scare away people who have no interest in yet another facile feel-good pop-Christianity trifle. Fear not! The miraculous elements are secondary, and either subtle or almost downplayed. The film doesn't go for cheap answers or emotion. It is a genuine exploration of faith and coping with undeserved suffering. It affirms hard-fought genuine faith.I urge you to see it, and to bring others with you, especially the unconvinced-who are not likely to find Jesus on the spot, but who may begin to see the reality of faith in a loving God who does not fit into our convenient boxes."
" 6 out of 10
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,9,"I'm only giving us a 9 Out of 10 to offset the dozen reviews i read that said the acting and Cinematography were good, but Yet they gave it a one star because of the Christian propaganda. Like really? Christian propaganda? As a Christian I can say that's not what I saw. I saw Hollywood trying to make a buck on a true story while still trying to stick to their political correctness as to not offend other religions. The movie goes so far that never even mentions the word Jesus. It only refers to God, even though in the real story it says she met Jesus. I think that's a pretty important piece that the director left out to keep this within the PC world of Hollywood, They also have multiple crosses shown throughout the movie that none of which are a crucifix with Jesus on them. Don't think that was not done on purpose.
They even threw in the two crazy Christian ladies To keep the narrative alive that there's so many Christian nut jobs out there. What those two women said about the girl being sick because she sinned Was ridiculous and something I could not imagine any Christian I know saying - And I would bet my left pinky toe never happened.
That aside, I thought the movie was pretty well acted as to most of these faith based films that tend to not be. And the filming was professionally done. It wasn't crazy corny like many of it's predecessors. All in all it was a nice movie to watch with the family and avoid the all the filth for one night.James 5.12
The prayer of a righteous person are powerful and effective."
" Really not worth a watch
",2020-02-18 00:00:00,1,"Despite the mention of this being based on true happened events, I value my life without religion very much. There are literally no five minutes without religion even being mentioned in this film. I get that a family (because this has happened more, I am not so cynical to believe that no miracles ever take place, but I don't believe there is such an entity as 'God' who is responsible for this) would have this journey from sickness to health, but I was baffled by how some big stars have lent themselves to cooperate in this particular story. Why this story? Why not a different one? From the hour and a half, the church is shown about every few moments. Very tiring. I have never been so disappointed by Jennifer Garner.
The acting in itself is not bad, it's just that the story is clearly too thin to carry on a whole movie, so they've chosen to depict that as much as possible. Pass."
" Amazing
",2019-08-19 00:00:00,7,A very beautiful story with amazing interpretations and deep meaning. Bravo to all you must see for sure
" What an amazing movie! Must watch
",2019-08-09 00:00:00,10,One of the best movies based on true story and it really moved me I love it. Thank you for sharing a beautiful experience with us
" Amazing movie. Ignore bad evaluations, because...
",2019-08-07 00:00:00,10,"Ignore the bad ratings and evaluations, because they are related to faith or religion. We need to talk about the movie. Religion is something very personal and always opens space for comments (good or bad). The movie is amazing. Really. Whether ou believe on it or not. But since its a true story you can think of a miracle or chance."
" Everyday is a miracle, such a beautiful movie I loved it !!!
",2019-06-29 00:00:00,9,"For me it was one of the greatest movies I've ever watched just because of the positive thing which made me believe that everything is miracle, everywhere is miracle and everyday is a miracle. The roles which the mother (Jennifer) and the daughter (Anna) had played was beautiful. It is a faith based movie and the beam family is an inspiring one."
" Faith Can Move Mountains
",2019-06-11 00:00:00,7,"This movie is about a terminally ill girl and faith at the end of it. This movie has Christian undertones. However if you are not a Christian and a theist, you can still relate. In a divisive world that we live in, this movie is like fresh air.
There are moments that will make you weep, especially when the little girl is in hospital. Yet there are moments of hope, when she meets the doctor and the waitress. The desperation the family to cope up with it is so real and raw.This movie gives hope in miracles and things that we don't know. If you believe in God, watch this. If you don't; still do. We all need some sunshine.
Also, if you don't know, this movie is based on real life incidents!"
" bad message
",2019-05-06 00:00:00,1,"Attention: Spoiler!
In the end of the movie we get to know that the Christian child was saved by god and the child of the irreligious father had to die. So the film tells us that only People who believe in god have Chance of healing? This is a real bad message."
" Worth watching!
",2019-04-29 00:00:00,9,"I watched this movie when I was emotionally lost in myself. At that point I was frankly disappointed of everything and didn't believe in anything. however everything changed when I watched this film.
The movie was a story about a little girl who was suffering from an unknown disease. Her parents do every possible thing to find the treatment. But no doctor could help them. Once when the girl was playing she falls from the tree and loses her consiousness. While she was in comma she sees high doors from where bright light was coming. She meets with her dead grandparents and then God who tells her to go back to life. She wakes up and days later,it comes out that she was cured. This story is based on a real story. The movie made me believe that miracles exist and we need to believe them."
" Actually a Movie
",2019-04-26 00:00:00,7,"I was dreading this movie. On the surface, it is everything I dislike about Christian film. By what it emphasized, the marketing made me think that I was in for a film where the struggles of life, while real, would be quickly gotten through, and the film would be mainly focusing on what happens after God has answered our prayers and we refuse to hide our light under a bushel. Granted I had not seen much of the marketing, I tend to avoid trailers and hype, and I've been burned by Christian film more times than I can count.So let's just say my expectations were low.This film surprised me though. That isn't to say it's all good, but I would definitely take the pile of films put out by Christian studios and imprints and put this one near the top of the stack. It certainly is more deserving of a theatrical release than most."
" a happy story
",2019-04-01 00:00:00,8,"I shall not nag to much , but this was a film that gave warmth and safe feelings to watch. even though smeared in with a gospel like glory of religion, it worked. basicly its because what the actors does, and secondly, i guess the basis for the whole production, a good book. it seems like we all need hope in our everydaylife, and miracles from heaven may be a good prescription, wether your a believer or not.having had a seriously ill child myself,that are sound and well now, who struggled with a smile every day from aged 0,5 to 4, sends me right back to then., i wont say that it was a miracle that saved him, but you can for sure tell we asked for one every day for 3 years(and still do....).its a film that can be seen by everyone, i'm sure even the dead would find this film comforting whereever they are somewhere, so i, the grumpy old man , put my recommendations to this film."
" Overall, a realistic film that will have you literally crying tears from every emotion (sadness, joy, etc.).
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,8,"Normally, I'm pretty hesitant to watch any movie that's overtly marketed as ""Christian."" The truth of the matter is, while I'm a Christian myself, these types of movies normally make me cringe at how cliche they are. When their message is continually shoved down our throats, it's hard to focus on anything else. I am all for inspiring stories of faith, but when the main thrust of your plot feels like a poorly written after-school special, it's hard to take seriously. Case in point: I really didn't like War Room (2015) not only because of the aforementioned qualms with the genre as a whole, but also because the characters and their actions felt completely unbelievable (and for a film about belief, this was a big no-no).Now, as you're aware of my stance on these types of movies, please note that I prefaced this with ""normally"". There are some films in this genre that do a good job of presenting men, women, and children of faith without making it the supreme focus of the film. For example, Soul Surfer (2011) was an excellent film in this genre because it focused more on the girl's faith that everything would turn out OK, even if she just had her arm bitten off by a shark. It's in these scenarios, where everything seems to go wrong, where we find the best stories about faith, perseverance, and God. This is why Miracles from Heaven (2016) is now my best example of this genre.Not only did this film cover the mother's fall away from the faith in the light of difficult medical circumstances (as most people would do), but it wasn't heavy handed about the faith aspect of the plot at all. In fact, the continual string of events leading to worsening conditions for her child played out much like they would for anyone who has had to take care of someone with a serious medical ailment. There are no answers as to why the family had to go through the ordeal, no answers as to why God lets this happen, and no answers as to how He was able to miraculously heal the girl, even in the midst of another tragedy. Because of these lack of answers, the other lives touched by the journey, and the lives who touched the family during the journey, Miracles from Heaven provides an incredibly realistic view at a situation that can only have one answer: God.Overall, a realistic film that will have you literally crying tears from every emotion (sadness, joy, etc.), I give Miracles from Heaven 4 stars out of 5."
" Add this to your Kendrick Brothers Collection.
",2019-02-22 00:00:00,10,"Just as most common docs. fail to recognize many GI issues. Acid reflux, Lactose intolerant. One sees this often. However interesting movies.This movies is similar to the Kendrick brothers christian films. Faith.
Jennifer Garner is in this film. She pulls of every role.
O"
" One of the best movies ever
",2019-02-11 00:00:00,10,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, I recommend to all people to watch it."
" Its a miracle
",2019-02-04 00:00:00,8,"To be honest i was searching the horror thriller stuff to watch but when i did not find even normal rated movie in horror crap as usual then i decided to watch that movie which was beyond my expectations that involved love , affection ,suffering and care among the mankind that becomes faith and miracle.
No words to express refreshed my mind and soul . No need to be biased while consider religion only as i did read some -ve views, its true based story. Yes miracle happens"
" Glad for this family...
",2019-01-31 00:00:00,5,"But, what about all the OTHER CHILDREN who continue to suffer? What was so special about this particular family? Questions questions questions!!!On another note, the real mom was so pretty- Garner didn't do her justice."
" Great movie to renew your beliefs
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,10,"Don't be scared to let it go. You don't need to a religious person or a Christian to understand faith is not always related to a specific religion but it requires some strong dive in your inner self to find that extra battery of life. Whenever I feel like I enter any church to pray and I look around. Some people are into it and some just sitting there or checking the cell messages. It is about what you believe, if it is Jesus or another sacred person for you, it is OK. Just remember that faith is a strong power available for those who believe it."
" Amazing movie
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,10,This is an amazing feel good movie that is based on a true story! I highly recommend this movie to anyone who needs an uplifting movie with a great story.
" can prayer heal?
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,2,Review: I found this movie intriguing because it is about the power of faith healing. The direction and screenplay wasn't bad. The casting and acting aren't bad either. All in all I would give this two out of a possible five stars.
" Christian clap trap
",2018-10-27 00:00:00,3,"I tend not to read the synopsis of films and even after watching, it made one 'pray' reference... If it was clearly labeled as a Christian or faith based film, I never would have bothered.The film was poor but as a 'non-believer', I find religious based films too much to stomach. If you are of a similar persuasion, pick another film."
" Heartwarming, well written, great actors.
",2018-09-13 00:00:00,10,"This is a tug on your heart strings in so many ways kind of film. When life hits you, it hits you hard, but you don't give up. That's exactly what this film shows. It also shows that there is kindness in the world and there are people who care. Love, laugh, hope, cry, cure....it's all wrapped up with a heartwarming bow."
" Great Family Movie
",2018-09-11 00:00:00,9,I thought this movie was very well done - Jennifer Garner was spot on. This really takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions and the fact that it's based on a true story brings you in even more.
" Emotional
",2018-09-09 00:00:00,10,This film brings a lot of emotion to it thanks to the amazing acting throughout and did make me tear up at the end and feel close to tears at various other points in the film. I also like that at the ending they showed the family in which this film was about which was a good addition.
" Wonderful movie
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,10,"It is really rare to get such an emotionally moving movie. This really touched me. I read some of the other views below which didn't surprise me to see ""anti religious"" comments. I just remember the young girls words in the movie. Some won't understand and that's OK. They will get it whenever they get it. If at all. The movie isn't a religion propaganda movie; it's a wonderful story that opens your heart and mind. This movie has helped me strengthen my own faith. I would highly recommend this movie. Again very rare to get anything so meaningful in a world of pain, distractions, blatant sex and boring monotonous movies that get churned out day and night with nothing to them. 
Tear jerker."
" Good but terriblel
",2018-06-30 00:00:00,1,"I acidentally watched his movie and its quite enjoyable but I cannot not comment on how a movie like this will further convince the gullable of gods existence and how he looks after people (despite him seemingly being rather selective). Therefore I have to consider a movie like this appalling and poison, because of how it will reinforce some people's ridiculous beliefs."
" Pathetic! Do you really think god will help your kid?
",2018-06-26 00:00:00,1,"I watched this movie on a bus, so I had no choice. So, one kid in Texas (small town Cristian family) gets really sick and the mother does not know what to, takes it to the doctor. The doctors do not know what to do, so the family goes to a big city, where the big doctors see the problem and start treatment. But the kid being a kid falls into a hollow tree and after being rescued by firefighters gets miraculously healed by the holy spirit. The mother prays the whole time so it must be God who healed the kid. The whole movie is pathetic, the whole idea that this mother believes a god will miraculously heal her kid, but not the doctors, is so wrong. If you so much believe then why bother to take it to the doctor aniway! The main actress is not likable at all. The movie is this kind of movie your aunt would watch and use it as an argument that God is almighty. Really. Bad. Movie."
" Nice, beautiful and well done
",2018-06-25 00:00:00,7,"I'm all for true stories made in films. This one is quite good and believable miracle, correlates well with the true story. The medical stuff is relatively well explained. The acting is decent. I accelerated the annoying bits. Good dvd extras of the real family."
" Too much of a religious propaganda
",2018-05-15 00:00:00,6,"I wanted to love this movie, I really did, but there are unfortunately a couple of things that bothered me immensely.First, I would like to stress that the actors did a terrific job. I actually cried when they cried. The plot was quite original as well. I would have easily given this movie a 9/10, if only the story was told differently.What I did not appreciate at all was the portrayal of atheists vs Christians (because the movie doesn't talk about just any religion). I really didn't like the fact that Christians were portrayed as these innately good, holy people who believe in God and miracles, and therefore deserve them. As opposed to the cynical, heretical atheists whose children die because they don't believe in the supernatural.I mean, let's assume for a second that this story actually happened, like the movie claims it did: a little girl with a severe intestinal disorder was cured miraculously after falling on her head just the right way. Fine, beautiful, magical. But why on earth did the journalist's daughter have to die at the end? Was it just because he was an atheist? And not just any kind of atheist for that matter. He basically didn't allow his daughter to believe in God; he was kind of rude to Christy (Jennifer Garner), who very conveniently was super nice and polite; his wife left him, didn't die just left, so he didn't have the support of a devoted, hard-working, religious partner like Christy did. Why? Because, let's be honest, in the eyes of Christians atheists are lost and empty people who don't believe in the sanctity of marriage, or the unconditional support of your family, and especially of sick children.But the moviemakers just had to take it even further by turning Ben (the journalist) into a believer in the end. I guess it's just like Anna said: ""They'll get there when they get there."" Heck, I too would consider converting, if that would apparently stop my future offspring from dying."
" Emotional, moving and a phenomenal story
",2018-02-28 00:00:00,10,"Miracles do happen! This is a phenomenal film. There are lows and highs witch all made me cry. The cast were brilliant in there rolls and the film, the story behind it and the miracle of it all is something incredible and this film is a must watch!!"
" The WORST of Any ""Emotional"" Movies
",2018-01-29 00:00:00,1,"This religious drama succeeds in visual representation but fails miserably in many different ways including a poorly written plot, boring characters, an awful score, and an offensive religious tone that comes off as putting down others for not believing in faith or the proper type of religion that gives second chances. This movie also fails in delivering emotion due to the lack of good acting and well written dialogue. The only type of audience that would like this flick would be religious people who would also find movies such as Left Behind and Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas to be quality movies. To anyone else who finds interest in this movie, do the world a favor and stay far far FAR away. If you want to watch a GOOD movie with religious themes, watch Life of Pi instead."
" A miracle to believe or not
",2017-12-26 00:00:00,7,"It is a film based on a tragedy of Beam's family, composed of three girls as well as their parents. Illness, an irreversible one affected one of the girls, and that is when family adventures begin, accompanied by economic and sentimental difficulties. The solution arrived unexpectedly, many can believe it, others cannot, and everyone is free to have his/her own opinion. Another value of the movie is to see how Americans, considered the most powerful country of the planet, suffer to lack sources for medical care, despite having true masters of medicine. This film was directed by Patricia Riggen with a cast of actors some not very much known, such as Jennifer Garner and Martin Henderson, in addition to the now famous Queen Latifah. The plot of the film is based on the novel ""Miracles in the sky"" written by Christy Beam with the real events that happened to her. The performances of the girls in this film are impressing, are really outstanding ones."
" Miracles From Heaven
",2017-12-03 00:00:00,10,"Possible spoiler...My daughter and I just watched this movie. It was at times hard to watch because you feel like you are there going through the whole ordeal with the family. JenniferGarner was really good in this movie. The whole cast was really great - - especially little Anna.This movie teaches all about how important it is never to give up hope at anytime - no matter how bad or unlikely things seem. We will never forget this movie and will watch it periodically to remind ourselves of all the important things in life. We have seen many miracles too, so we know they can and do happen. Prayer definitely works and can move mountains. It has for us too. Although you go into this movie knowing that some kind of miracles happens, you really don't know what happens until the very end."
" faith-based tear jerker
",2017-11-22 00:00:00,7,"Christy (Jennifer Garner) and Kevin Beam (Martin Henderson) have daughters Anna (Kylie Rogers), Abbie (Brighton Sharbino), and Adelynn (Courtney Fansler). They take care of animals with a giant dead tree in their yard. They attend the small Texas town church of Pastor Scott (John Carroll Lynch). Anna suddenly comes down with a mysterious illness and is in constant pain. Eventually, she's diagnosed with an incurable digestive disease. They are directed to specialist Dr. Nurko (Eugenio Derbez) in Boston. In desperation, Christy and Anna go see the doctor without the impossible-to-get appointment. Anna is shown kindness along the way like Boston waitress Angela (Queen Latifah). This is a real tear jerker especially with the suffering of young Anna. The acting is solid all around. I can do without the extended montages. This is a faith-based film. It gets a little heavy handed in the end. It would function more effectively by letting Anna's storytelling room to breathe. It tries to force it which diminishes Anna's tale to only the believers. This almost transcends the genre which could have been great."
" Another publicity stunt for religion
",2017-11-21 00:00:00,1,"When I saw this movie I was reminded of ""The Blind Side"" which was completely fabricated to fit the narrative of the family involved with the story.A movie which is filled with lies and fabrications of real life events of a sick little girl who falls down a dead tree which she never was upside down the entire time as the movie misleads the viewers. She was actually right side up and was able to lay down in the fetal position.The story of their Jesus is an afterthought and added to fulfill their self sustaining prophecy that their religion is the best and you need to believe in it because look at what our god did. Well why did your god give your child the condition in the first place? Just so that at a later time events like these can happen? What a crock.So called ""miracles"" like this happen all the time and not only with christians, but hindus, muslims and buddhists. It happens all the time, in every country and with every belief system. When they do happen they always give credit to (insert religious icon)The acting is horrible, the direction worse and the script is a complete lie.I look no further than the scene with the father watching television where the commentator says ""climate change is false..."" The second example is the father (Ben) who stands up in church to speak about his daughter who had cancer (which isn't real). This is one of two examples in the movie where I find the story is designed to fit a narrative for the familie's views."
" From Film, To Condemnation.
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,4,"It's the last 20 minutes or so that completely ruins this movie. It's incredibly bias, arrogant, judgmental and manipulative, and the ""miracle"", whether true or not, leans totally on the credibility of a Biography, as a genre, like how animation does the same with the genre of Adventure.The first hour to an hour 15 minutes, I was truly enjoying this film, and I empowered it to allow myself the ability for self reflection, and of course, accept the bio for what it is, and what it'll be... And perhaps while I'm at it, gain some level of inspiration myself, however, slow claps, a soulless speech, blatant manipulation to make the story lean one way based on a tale told by an already bias girl who is also heavily influenced by the people she looks up to most (her parents), and just to add insult to injury, we have a man coming forth about the death of his daughter in a fashion where the movie almost damn near implies his daughter died because of his contrary beliefs, with thick sugarcoating of course, completely and utterly ruins and destroys the credibility this film had been setting up.Truthfully, I almost even feel as if, the director, Patricia Riggen, wasn't a director, but rather, the pastor or member of the congregation itself. There is a lot that is wrong with this film; it starts off as a movie, just to end up being a judgment, no matter how much they tried to hide it.Apart from that, just looking at the cinematography, directing, score and acting; The cinematography was pretty great, I've never seen Boston look that good. The acting, one thumb up - though some characters felt random and useless, the music was touching at quite a few points and the directing, had flaws - like the young doctor's condescending and arrogant reaction to Christy's woes and the other doctor delivering the news of Anna's fall with a ""gambit"" first; it wasn't funny, it was misplaced and highly inappropriate - for example, but overall, a satisfactory job I guess.This movie was floating well above 6/10 for its majority, however that last 20 minutes, was just a crime too difficult to ignore. 4/10, and to be honest, I can't help but feel it deserves even less."
" I wanted to like it more than I did
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,6,"As a Christ follower, and one who enjoys uplifting and encouraging films, I'm always looking for faith-based movies to see. I've seen some good ones, but also (unfortunately) too many - though sincerely made - not so good ones. This one was not only highly rated on Netflix, but it features two well-known actresses (Jennifer Garner and Queen Latifah) and a couple of recognizable character actors (Martin Lawrence and John Carroll Lynch) as well. So I thought I'd check it out.Firstly, I didn't know the story of the Beam family as told in the book which shares the film's title; it was a New York Times Bestseller written by a Texas mother named Christy Beam (Garner's character) a couple of years ago. I also didn't know it was about a young girl's claim that she went to Heaven and returned. This non- Biblical concept was exploited a few years earlier in a film I definitely avoided. So, I wouldn't have 'rented' this one if I'd have known in advance that it was going to promote the same heretical concept.However, since this part of the plot isn't revealed until late in the drama, I watched it unaware of what was going to happen, like anyone else unfamiliar with this purported true story.It's actually pretty good, for the most part. It realistically portrays the family's struggles through the hardships and inherent suffering when dealing with the torturous medical condition of one of their three daughters. Anna, played by Kylie Rogers, who is essentially terminal, though - unless I missed it - no doctor says anything like ""she has 14 months to live"".I certainly hope that there really are doctors like Dr. Nurko (Eugenio Derbez), the busy specialist in Boston that treats Anna's condition(s). What a bright light of joy amidst such difficult circumstances. He's one of two characters - the other is played by Queen Latifah - that exhibit Christ-like behavior without explicitly being identified as having faith in Jesus.In fact, there are several other characters who profess to be Christians that espouse misguided Pharisaical beliefs: that Anna's condition is due to sin or a lack of faith in the Beam family. Fortunately, Christy's Pastor Scott (Lynch) later says to Christy: ""Kevin (her husband, played by Henderson) told me what those ladies said to you, and ... I sure wish that I could give everybody a spiritual IQ test before they walk in the door.""I'm really not sure if the mixed messages of these characterizations - in addition to Christy's inconsistent faith throughout - were intentional or just symptomatic of the flawed Prosperity Gospel to which producer TD Jakes subscribes.Finally, actress Garner didn't deliver the emotional depth that was required to carry the picture. This was surprising given that she also has three daughters and her director, Patricia Riggen (who ably conveyed the drama of The 33 (2015)), is the mother of a daughter herself."
" Hmmmm. A Good Movie, but...
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,8,"Good plot. Good story. And excellent acting with a really professional cast. Not your average movie. Unusual story and really watch worthy. I have one, and only one comment which makes me a bit uneasy. Maybe 2. I am a Christian, and a faithful church goer, but I am saddened that although the story highlights Anna's view and reason for her miracle, the movie did not portray this in a balanced way. Instead it highlights a bias view of a particular version of Christianity which is flawed and full of propaganda. This from the buckle of the Bible Belt, Texas US evangelical Christianity. Perhaps we need a disclaimer before the start of the movie, so that those who are not Christian knows that the beliefs portrayed in the film comes from a corner of Christianity and not universally accepted by every Christian faith. Unfortunately this is what ruins the Christian genre of movies out there, which can have positive messages but are rejected by the non-Christian."
" Very inspirational story
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,10,"This is a very inspirational story,i believe in miracles everyday and glad to hear this story.Im Grateful for Christy sharing the story.I never read the book or even heard anything about the story.I seen the movie and seen it was based off a true story and so i googled it up.The movie was intense and the whole time i felt for the life's at hand. it even made me realize how precious life really is.I felt what if it was one of my children and couldn't imagine going through what you guys have been through.I have a 18 year old daughter a 13 year old son a 8 year old son and a 4 year old son.The movie made me feel just how lucky i am to have such blessings in my life.We as people take for granted sometimes at what we do have.This story for me is a wake up call that makes me remember and realize how grateful, short, and precious life is and we need to sometimes take time out of our busy fast paced lives to just enjoy the moments we have with our loved ones and just be grateful and appreciative of what life has to offer us.Thank you beam family again for sharing your story and hope it touches other peoples lives like it did mine."
" Hallmark Movie?
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,7,"This is a true life story of a young girl Annabelle Beam who developed a rare condition that effected her digestion in a way that would prove fatal. After falling 30 feet head first down a hollowed out tree she was miraculously cured in a way that the surgeon who's care she was under couldn't understand. The direction was capably executed and the interaction between the actors was relaxed and believable, especially Jennifer Garner who gave a very good performance as the distraught mother KrissyThe only problem I had with it was it's over sentimentality. I understand that this is based on actual events, but it almost felt like a Hallmark movie where it never rains and all the actors have perfect hair, teeth and makeup, so to bag an A list actress to play the lead was a coup in itself. Whether you believe in God or not, there's obviously something unexplainable that happened to this young girl to inspire her story to movie status. Still, it's enjoyable and above average for this type of film, which I enjoyed"
" 10 Review- An amazing must see film
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,10,"As someone who isn't a Christian I enjoyed this movie! Simply because I am a mother! I never leave reviews, but this movie moved me in ways I truly didn't expect. Don't listen to these simple minded people who rated this movie a 1 or 3. Watch it. It's worth your time. And if you are a parent... grab your child and hold on."
" Really enjoyable
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,10,"I really enjoyed this faith-based film. Unlike so many other faith-based movies it felt really authentic...I didn't get the sense at any point that I was being manipulated as the audience, or that it was presenting the world simplistically, as so many other faith-based movies do. This film isn't afraid to tackle the tough questions of life, or portray someone who is struggling with their faith. The ending is very moving and uplifting, whilst remaining true to just how difficult life can be."
" Surprisingly Good
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,6,"I watched this movie without knowing anything about it. It turned out to be a nice little family film. It was a very relatable story not only for parents, but my young daughter enjoyed it even more. The themes of faith and prayer are not something she's shown interest in before, so it was a surprise that she ended up liking it as much as she did. I liked the fact that this movie challenged her thinking a little bit. If the child was sick, then fell 20 feet and got trapped in a tree, how do you account for her recovery? Based on a true story, this movie forces one to consider the existence and meaning of miracles."
" Anna Beam got sick with an incurable disease and it was cured with a miracle (true story)
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,10,"I am not a huge fan of religious films, but ""Miracles From Heaven"", directed by Patricia Riggen and written by Randy Brown, impressed me with the combination of actor selection and the way the story was directed. Believer or not, this dramatic family film will make it difficult for anyone to hold back tears during this true story. Christy Beam, who is perfectly played by Jennifer Garner, is a mother of three little girls and the wife of Kevin (Martin Henderson). Together, they regularly attended services at a mass church in Texas as a healthy, happy family.Now the trailer itself says it all, so there won't be any spoilers. ""Life is good, Christy Beam,"" said Kevin, which definitely foreshadows that their lives were about to turn upside down. It started when their bright 12-year-old Anna (Kylie Rogers) suffered never ending stomach pain. Multiple doctors insisted not to worry since her condition was either lactose intolerance or acid reflux. Christy Beam, being a mother with an instinct, knew her daughter was dealing with something more serious. It was frustrating to see these doctors just constantly telling Christy Beam to calm down. Anna was then diagnosed with a rare intestinal disorder that didn't have a medical cure. From that point, Anna and Christy were flying back and forth from Texas to Boston to meet with the best pediatric gastroenterologist, Dr. Samuel Nurko (Eugenio Derbez). He had a way of bringing out the best of the sick children with his light-hearted humor, which was pleasing to watch. Anna also encountered a friendship with a compassionate waitress, Angela (Queen Latifah). She had an idea that Anna was sick, so she encouraged them to let her give them a personal tour with a twist. She has never been a disappointment with her acting and performances, and she continued that legacy in ""Miracles From Heaven."" Both of their acting roles brought joy and a comic relief in the movie. Throughout the film, it's fascinating to notice the small miracles happen, which is ultimately what ""Miracles From Heaven"" is about. However, that one miracle, that faith, that Christy was desperately searching for came when Anna fell thirty feet down of the inside of a tall tree and hit head first. It may not sound like a miracle, but not only she survived the fall, her incurable disease was cured. Even though the audience already knew what was going to happen from the trailer, it is hard not to be engaged by that intense moment; it had myself on the edge of the chair the entire time. Anna claimed that when she was spiritually gone, she experienced a moment with God; one that is hard to believe. It was definitely cheesy and may seem impossible to understand, but it just depends on what people's beliefs are. The Beam Family knew it was a miracle; as do I. What made this film worked so well was the emotional performance put on by Jennifer Garner. Through the character Christy Beam, she expressed resilience, vulnerability and real warmth. Patricia Riggen, as the director, seemed to have no challenge with keeping the viewer engaged since I was just crying throughout the whole movie. It was a constant roller-coaster that was filled with anger, happiness, and sadness. Like I said, I am not a huge believer, but from the beginning to the end, ""Miracles From Heaven,"" is a heart-warming movie."
" A true story
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,7,"Miracle ... or how to remain optimistic. I won't say that you have to believe in God because faith is omnipresent in this film. But, whatever you are going through, because of this film, you will know that you will never be alone anymore. It is a wonderful film which shows you that you should never give up. It is impossible not to cry but what a beautiful film. The actors are amazing. Jennifer Garner is perfect in this role. What else can I say ? It is a incredible story and I just can tell you that you should see this film."
" Amazing but Horribly Sad
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,8,"As a Christian, I can tell you this movie is very uplifting to anyone who follows the religion. This movie was very well written and filmed, also, with no plot holes I was able to notice. My one issue with this movie (and the reason I did not give it a full 10/10) is how utterly depressing it is. I could generally be considered a tough person, but it was hard for even me to hold back all my tears. Yes, of course there's much resolution, but let's just say that in certain cases there isn't. I definitely wouldn't recommend watching it alone, but make sure you're comfortable with the person you watch it with. If you're not comfortable crying in front of people... yeah.MIRACLES FROM HEAVEN~Chie~"
