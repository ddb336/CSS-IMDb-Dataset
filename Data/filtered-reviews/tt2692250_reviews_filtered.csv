" Good end to an average trilogy
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,6,"Secret of the tomb is a lot better than the first sequel, which wasn't very good at all and almost as good as the original. It doesn't try to be too ambitious and just has a lot of solid jokes and humour, it's not great by any means but it is good.6/10: Notable for being Robin Williams' last feature film too"
" children and family fun comedy
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,5,"The night at the museum series has been my family favourite ever since the first movie.Y'know, I actually skipped the night at the museum 2 because my dad said Ben stiller and Dexter were fighting for half of the whole movie, so I trusted him and skipped it.This movie's acting is cool but the story was terribly horrible. There was also a cool section near the end when Dan Stevens ended up with Hugh Jackman.My family said it was alright. My brother liked it (considering he's only 4).This movie gave me a couple of smirks and a giggle. But I still dont think this movie is in my favourites list.the ending of the movie was funny and happy. I would mostly recommend this movie from ages 3 - 80 years old for those who like memes and comedy."
" Least favorite of the bunch.
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,5,"Unfortunately, the trilogy has now officially died. Both 1st and 2nd films were both successful at the box office with positive reviews from critics and fans. The third part proved also successful at the box office, but not as successful as the previous ones. Night at the Museum movies have now gone from funny and magical films of adventures to tired and boring films of stupidity, In terms of plot and characters, so what went wrong?:1. The plot itself is the biggest reason to the film being bad. The plot is too simple and lot of it rehashed from Part 1. It's basically Part 1 all over again.2. The characters we KNEW in love in the previous films have now gone into a boring and completely muted idiots. It feels like even the actors don't want to be in this film.3. Forgettable new characters. Sir Lancelot (Dan Stevens) acts as a very annoying idiot just to be with the main ones, then Turns into a villain for no reason, then turns into friendly in the end of the film. Next, we have Tilly (Rebel Wilson), a complete jerk and mess-of-a-girl I've ever seen. She's so annoying that I even skip the parts she's in. Every scenes she's in aren't great. She's also the only character from any of these films supposed to be a jerk.4. Wasted cameos & recasting. For example, the villains from the first film make cameos in this film, (also played with the same actors) and get only like 5 minutes of screentime?!!! Jake Cherry, who played Nicky has been recast with Skylar Gisondo. The problem was that the duo was born on the SAME YEAR. What's the point of recasting someone with someone else, who has born on the same year as him?5. Disrespectful ending. The film ends with Larry Daley quitting his job as a night guard to go work as a historian teacher, because the tablet, which had to be left alone with Ahkmenrah and his parents to London, then turning all the wax figures of New York to wax forever. However, the film cuts to 3 years later with the annoying girl, Tilly now working as the new night guard in the New York museum. A party is currently held in there and the wax figures have came to life due to Ahkmenrah having time in there with them. Outside, Larry Dayle is seen looking at the party while smiling. It feels very disrespectful towards him for not even being invited to the party or just going inside to party.The only good things about this film:1. The battle in the Relativity painting: There's a scene where Larry and Teddy are fighting for the tablet from Lancelot. They accidentally get into one of M.C. Escher's paintings, ""Relativity"" where the laws of gravity do not apply, causing them constantly fail to catch the tablet. The visual effects and CGI- effects are VERY SUPREME in this scene, It's very satisfying to watch.2. Robin Williams' character, Theodore Roosevelt might be the only good character in this film. He still does everything very well and acts very well like in the previous films.3. Mediocre humor.Overall, those 3 good things aren't enough to save this film, which was just a sad possible ending to the series, aswell as a bad last movie to Robin Williams and Mickey Rooney, who both sadly passed away in 2014."
" Its a bit bland
",2020-11-25 00:00:00,5,"If you are going to rehash a story concept it helps to add something to the mix to make it worthwhile.
Secret Tomb doesn't really manage that so we are left with a ho hum effort that does have a few laughs but overall lacks any real reason to exist.Young kids will enjoy it but for everyone else go visit a rainforest instead, you will have a better time!"
" A fitting end
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,8,Everything tied up neatly and although in 3rd place for best film of the 3 it was still enjoyable
" 10 out of 10...
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,10,"I'm giving this a 10 just to annoy all the adults on here giving a children's movie low scores and actually saying it was childish??? You can't make this stuff up! I watched it with my family including my 8 year old and we all loved it, much better than the second movie and nice end to the trilogy!"
" Great Family movie
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,7,I've only seen it once but it was very good and funny and fun for a family movie
" Fun movie
",2020-07-05 00:00:00,7,It's a funny movie for a boring afternoon. Don't expect much just have fun. I loved the scene with Hugh Jackman. It was hilarious!!!
" Rating the Secret of the Tomb
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,7,"Sienna's Rating:7 Stars
Sebs Rating:10 Stars!
Paul's Rating 7 StarsWe liked this for good all-around feel, and the focus on the Egyptian exhibits! However, lots of second-rate Indiana Jones themes and sub-plots, and the British Museum was inaccurate - they definitely don't have dinosaurs there!"
" Night at the Museum 3 is the best part !!!!
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,9,Even nicer than the first part and the second. Was amusing. xD And it was funnier than the first part. 9/10 *
" Good fun with a nice story!
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,9,I like this better than the second one! There is more depth than expected!
" A bit disappointing
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,4,"The story has been slightly changed compared to its predecessors, but nothing really new.
The plot was, as usual, silly and childish.
Overall, it was OK, a funny children's movie."
" It's worth staying one last night
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,8,"I wasn't expecting this film to be as good as it was. I only saw it because it's Robin Williams' last film. Surprisingly, it didn't feel like a re-hash and was actually funny. It's one of the funniest films this year. Everyone does such a great job. It's a bittersweet end to both the Night at the Museum films and Robin Williams' films. This is a fun movie and its so clever. Hopefully there will be a box set of all three films released so I can watch them back-to-back. I cried because the end is so bittersweet. It's a terrific send-off to the late, great Robin Williams. You will be missed.
Grade: B. 8/10. 3.5/5 stars"
" Rip Robin Williams ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,10,"One of the best movies ever made!
I love you RobinðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢"
" Great movie
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,10,"What gives this a 10 is all the characters! The feeling of family and a love for their community gave them the desire to look out for each other, as is how family and community should be. Very fun movie."
" The first movie was...
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,1,"The first movie was tolerable. The second movie was at best, a one time viewing. The third movie is just a cash grab with a script they pulled out of the garbage.There is nothing about the third movie I liked. It was a rehash of the same terrible jokes, except this time they do it across the pond.F- rating. If I could give it negative stars I would do so."
" Just awful
",2019-12-25 00:00:00,1,"Written by 3 yr olds, for 3 yr olds featuring comedy actors who simply stopped being funny years ago or never were."
" Just another Night at the Museum
",2019-11-13 00:00:00,5,I am not sure if we need another on of these but we got one. This one seems like the same old thing.
" Lazy writing
",2019-11-10 00:00:00,5,"Few decent jokes however lazy writing, filled with way to many conveniences"
" Sweet Ending
",2019-11-09 00:00:00,8,I didn't know there was a third film! It was so lovely to see Robin Williams. It tied up the series in a really sweet way. Fab little cameos too.
" Ugh
",2019-09-12 00:00:00,3,"Like it wasn't already bad and now this, it gets worse within every sequels"
" Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb
",2019-07-20 00:00:00,9,"9/10 - not the best of the trilogy, but a nice conclusion to the blockbuster series"
" Amazing movie!!
",2019-05-27 00:00:00,10,"This movie was truly amazing!!! I love all 3 Night at the Museum movies, but knowing this was Robin William's last I bawled. I've been a fan of Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon since The State and they did amazing creating these characters. The characters in the movies are so magnetic. I feel like I'm going to miss seeing them now that we have finished the trilogy."
" GOT TO BE REAL
",2019-05-23 00:00:00,7,"The museum has been turned into a night time show, one that goes awry. Larry (Ben Stiller) travels with a crate full of characters to the London Museum in order to unravel the secret and restore order. While there we meet Sir Lancelot (Dan Stevens) and Ben Kingsley, and Rebel Wilson for broader market appeal (i.e. Brits/Aussies buy and see this movie).The film is clearly for kids. The action and drama is low intensity. Larry struggles with his son (Skyler Gisondo) who does not want to attend college.Hugh Jackman manages to play and laugh at himself. There is a speech given by Robin Williams about moving on which was a bit sad. Should be good fun for the kids, although they could have done it without a urinating monkey and BTW Orion doesn't have a bow.Happy Ending"
" Almost good until Rebel Wilson
",2019-05-07 00:00:00,5,"Loved 1 and 2 of Night at the Museum, I was really hoping this one would be just as good. Everything was fine until Rebel Wilson entered, sorry but she ruined the movie. When she wasn't in the movie it was good, I watched it and tried to eliminate her from the scenes and it went fine. She was just an added annoyance which brought the movie down, I guess they thought her name would make it a hit. Wrong!!!!! you did not need her."
" Almost better
",2019-04-13 00:00:00,5,"Almost better than the 2nd, but still not better than the 1st. You can watch it with your family too."
" A perfect conclusion for a great trilogy
",2019-01-25 00:00:00,9,"I really really loved the first NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM, it was funny, enjoyable, full of great CGI, and with great performances by all the actors. The first of the two sequels, BATTLE OF THE SMITHSONIAN, even though not liked by many, it was just as enjoyable, and I liked it very much. This, the concluding chapter of the series, is also very enjoyable.In SECRET OF THE TOMB Larry Daley and his friends (and also his son) have to go to the British Museum for re-charging the tablet because it became green after years and all the exhibits behave very strange. In London Larry and the gang meet Sir Lancelot, a Tryceratops skeleton, a huge 7-headed snake, a Garuda and Akmenrah's parents. And it all ends well, with, after some years, all the exhibits from the British Museum in the New York museum.Even though a bit weak when compared to the first two, this chapter is still good. There is as usually in the series great CGI and special effects. The cast is as always full of famous faces: in small cameos Dick van Dyke, Bill Cobbs and Mickey Rooney (in his final movie), Hugh Jackman as himself, Robin Williams (in his final live action performance) and Ben Kingsley as Akmenrah's dad. But I have to agree with some other reviewers including TheLittleSongbird that Rebel Wilson is very annoying at times.However, while not perfect like his two predecessors, it's still very worth watching also for Robin Williams' final bow. I recommend strongly this trilogy and have great fun while watching it!"
" Just no
",2018-10-01 00:00:00,2,"Plus side: Dick Van Dyke is back
Minus: mostly everything else. They change the actor who plays the son, robin William's last movie, and in my opinion. They should have not made any sequels and stuck to the original.
Rebel Wilson, not great. Seems she tries too hard
I just think this might be the worst one (next to the second)I will still see the Dick Van Dyke scenes and that's it. RIP ROBIN WILLIAMS"
" Has its moments
",2018-09-19 00:00:00,6,"Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb is the third and final film of the franchise. Having lower than expected expectations based on both box office and quality outcome, Secret of the Tomb is a decent fun loved silly family film that has some quality moments thought at the same time doesn't offer much of anything new. Not on the same level entertainment of thrill wise as the original, this film is still quite a fun watch. Recommend for those who have watched the other films of the series."
" Shouldn't stay in the tomb, shouldn't stay out either
",2018-08-28 00:00:00,5,"Really enjoyed the first 'Night at the Museum'. Was less taken with the second, though that was more a mixed feelings sort film rather than a bad one. While not particularly well received, there was interest as to how the third 'Night at the Museum' film would fare and how the trilogy would end. Also the cast are too good to resist. 'Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb' to me didn't turn out to be terrible. Not great, or particularly good, but it is watchable enough and like the second film in being a mixed feelings sort of film. Where does it fare compared to the previous two films? It is for me the weakest of the three and indicative that the series had run its course. It does have enough to warrant a one-time watch, with the special effects and the cast being the best assets.The special effects are all round terrific, elaborate without being overblown and it was clear a lot of effort went into them. The museum setting provides a good atmosphere and all the different historical and such settings and attention to detail are attractive and again a lot of effort went into them. The score is rousing and there are amusing moments as well as thrilling ones.Ben Stiller makes the most out of his material and works hard to make it work. Dan Stevens is a quite exuberant addition as Lancelot, Ricky Gervais is fun and it was interesting seeing Rami Malek and Ben Kingsley together (Malek doesn't quite out-act Kingsley but more than holds his own). Dick Van Dyke and Mickey Rooney (in his final film) make nice small appearances, but other than Stevens the best performance comes from Robin Williams in a performance that's funny and somewhat moving. The monkey is also a scene stealer and just about avoids falling into distaste and the digs and references are quite nice.However, the dialogue tends to be forced and too many of the jokes suffer from fatigue. Larry was written with much more enthusiasm before, he is not particularly interesting here, despite some well-intentioned if cloying father-son development, and he is made to act like too much of an idiot in other places. Owen Wilson and Steve Coogan try too hard and have been much funnier and better used elsewhere, while Rebel Wilson is just irritating. The direction is not as assured.It's the story that comes off worst. It is very tired and predictable, and that is evident in lacklustre pacing and too many been there done that elements, including conflict that is too obvious too early. There is a sense of trying to do too much, hence why things feel muddled, and the characters are too many, some not always relevant. Structurally it feels cobbled together, while the final third is incredibly rushed and over-the-top and culminates in an ending where the sentimentality is too hard to stomach.Concluding, watchable but also rather lacking. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
" Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb
",2018-08-23 00:00:00,4,"Obviously with this third film I wanted to complete the trilogy, but it was also significant, being the last movie for both Mickey Rooney and Robin Williams, before their tragic deaths, I assumed it was going to be fairly terrible, but I still watched, directed by Shawn Levy (Big Fat Liar, Cheaper by the Dozen, The Pink Panther, Real Steel). Basically a flashback to 1938 in Egypt reveals that the magical Tablet of Ahkmenrah was taken by a team of archaeologists in the discovered tomb of pharaoh Ahkmenrah, locals warn the group that removing the tablet will end its magic. In present day New York, Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) remains the night guard of the American Museum of Natural History. He, Theodore Roosevelt (Robin Williams), Sacagawea (Mizuo Peck), Attila the Hun (Patrick Gallagher), Jedediah (Owen Wilson), Octavius (Steve Coogan), Rexy the Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton and Dexter the capuchin monkey (Crystal the Monkey) help re-open the Hayden Planetarium. Larry is also introduced to a new wax Neanderthal named Laaa (Stiller), he resembles Larry and identifies him as his father. Ahkmenrah (Bohemian Rhapsody's Rami Malek) shows Larry that the magical tablet is corroding, it is causing the exhibits to act erratically, this causes mayhem at the reopening of the planetarium. Afterwards, Larry catches his son Nick (Skyler Gisondo, replacing Jake Cherry) throwing a house party, he is planning on taking a gap year to sort out his life. Larry meets Cecil (Dick Van Dyke), who was part of the Egyptian discovery team, he is now in retirement, he realises the end of the tablet's magic will cause the exhibits to become lifeless. Cecil says that Ahkmenrah's parents, Merenkahre (Sir Ben Kingsley) and Shepseheret, may be able to restore the tablet's power, but they are located in the British Museum. Larry convinces the museum's curator, Dr. McPhee (Ricky Gervais) to allow him to ship Ahkmenrah to London to restore the tablet. Larry and Nick travel to the British Museum, and eventually get past suspicious nightguard Tilly (Rebel Wilson). To Larry's surprise, Roosevelt, Sacagawea, Attila, Jed, Octavius, Dexter, Rexy and Laaa have come as well, the tablet brings the British Museum exhibits to life. They are joined by a wax Sir Lancelot (Dan Stevens), who helps them fight off aggressive museum exhibits like a Xiangliu statue and a Triceratops skeleton. Jedediah and Octavius fall through a ventilation shaft and end up in an erupting Pompeii model, but are rescued by Dexter. The group find Ahkmenrah's parents, they learn the tablet empowered through the magic of Khonsu 's power, it can be regenerated by moonlight. But Lancelot mistakes the tablet for the Holy Grail and steals it, leaving to find Camelot, and then Larry and Laa wind up locked in the employee break room by Tilly. They manage to escape, Larry goes after Lancelot, while Laa stays behind to distract Tilly, during which they become attracted to each other. Lancelot interrupts a performance of the stage musical Camelot, mistaking actors Hugh Jackman and Alice Eve for King Arthur and Queen Guinevere, but Larry and the others chase him to the theatre roof. The New York exhibits begin to die, Lancelot realises that the quest was about them and gives the tablet back. The moonlight restores the tablet's power, saving the exhibits. It is decided that Ahkmenrah and the tablet should stay in the British Museum, even if it means the New York exhibits will no longer come to life. Back in New York, Larry spends some final moments with his friends before sunrise. Three years later, Larry took the blame for the planetarium incident, giving McPhee his job back, Larry now works as a teacher. A travelling British Museum exhibit comes to New York, Tilly becomes the new nightguard, and gives McPhee the tablet, showing him its power and the exhibits come to life, Larry watches the party going on from outside. Also starring Mickey Rooney as Gus, Bill Cobbs as Reginald, Rachael Harris as Madeline Phelps, Matt Frewer as Archibald Stanley and Brad Garrett as the voice of the Easter Island Head. The returning cast members are all fine, and newcomers Wilson and Stevens are reasonable, the story is simple enough, but the way it is put together is uneven, the addition of more historical figures may be enjoyable, and the special effects and wonderful views of beloved museums are good, but it is predictable and not as funny as it was previously, a big of a bum note, a disappointing and below average fantasy comedy adventure. Okay!"
" Teddy and the gang are back
",2018-07-17 00:00:00,6,"It will be hard to imagine a fourth Night At The Museum film without Robin Williams playing Teddy Roosevelt so I'm betting this film will end the series with
a trilogy. Still who knows where Ben Stiller will be going next.In this one Stiller learns that the ancient Egyptian tablet that's causing the exhibits to come to life is running out of juice, it needs exposure to the moonlight
every so often for a recharge. The secret is at the British Museum so Stiller and a
select crew from the past two stories accompany him and son Skyler Gisondo.Hero of the first Night At The Museum Rami Malek gets to meet the exhibit of
his father Ben Kingsley the ancient pharoah who created the tablet. Our crew
also has to deal with a rogue Sir Lancelot exhibit who thinks the tablet is the
Holy Grail played by Dan Stevens.The good family entertainment standard is kept up in Secret Of The Tomb. Best scene was Stevens with Stiller and the gang chasing him interrupting a
revival of Camelot on Drury Lane with Hugh Jackman as Arthur as Stevens makes his report to his liege.I kind of hope there's another one, but who could replace Robin Williams?"
" Caps off the series in a respectful and surprisingly resonant way; a fun return to form.
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,6,"'Night At The Museum: Secret Of The Tomb (2014)' follows its own established formula almost verbatim, but does cap off the series rather nicely by providing an apt and definitive end in a way which feels respectful and even slightly resonant (though its final dance number does take away from its otherwise surprisingly melancholic mood). The picture is consistently fairly fun and it has few decent laughs along the way. There are also a couple of nice new characters (along with some cool, if strange, cameos) and some noteworthy set-pieces. It's about as good as its immediate predecessor. 6/10"
" Astonishing
",2017-12-12 00:00:00,8,"This film served as great entertainment with its colorful cast and numerous plot twists. Levy used all characters from its previous version of this movie and obviously comfortable with Levy's directing style and the film's dramatic tone.
It was brilliant! i have almost lost all my adventures and interests of my life. Thanks to this wonderful film. One thing i didn't like was an expression of the caretaker's son, that was dreadful. I think Levy shouldn't have chosen that actor.
However, rest of the content and actors were okay, just like usual."
" This movie is awesome
",2017-12-06 00:00:00,8,"in my mind, this movie is awesome. This movie contains magic about of the tomb. It can revive all of the exhibits. And they can walk, talk and some of them love each other. This movie was the most interesting movie i've ever watched. I decided to go to the museum nearly. There are many special scenes and funny moves. It isn't possible in real life but it is really enjoyed. If you didn't watch this movie I advice you to watch this film. Highly recommended."
" Night at the MuseumÂ… or is it morning lets say its Night at the Museum yeah sounds better
",2017-10-03 00:00:00,7,"I have just seen this movie and to me i really like it and to me i like this movie i would watch but not the kind of movie i would love. So i think the groups of people who would love or maybe just like could be explorers, full of action people,people that like lots funny movies,people that are fine with lots of different emotions, fiction people and people that like movies. But i would not recommend this to you if you don't like non fiction movies, or if you don't like the characters, or any of the things i said about people who would watch this but the opposite of what i said about it.When the exhibits at New York's Natural History Museum start behaving strangely, Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) -- now the director of nighttime operations -- must find out the cause. He learns that the Tablet, which magically brings Teddy Roosevelt (Robin Williams), Jedediah (Owen Wilson) and the other exhibits to life at night, has started to decay. Larry, along with his son and museum friends, must travel to London's British Museum to learn how to prevent the Tablet's magic from disappearing. I think the whole cast did a good job and really worked hard to make this movie."
" night at the museum secret of the tomb
",2017-10-02 00:00:00,9,"One last night at the museum At the Museum of Natural History, there's a new exhibit being unveiled. Larry Daley, who manages the night exhibit where the exhibits come to life because of the Tablet of Ahkmenrah, is in charge of the presentation. But when the exhibits go awry, Larry finds himself in trouble. He learns the Tablet is corroding so he does some research and learns that Cecil, the former museum guard, was at the site when the Tablet was discovered. He tells Larry they were warned if they remove it could mean the end. Larry realizes it means the end of the magic. He talks to Ahkmenrah who says that he doesn't know anything. Only his father the Pharoah knows the Tablet's secrets. He learns that the Pharaoh was sent to the London museum. We all know the premise; a special Egyptian tablet makes it possible for all the exhibits in the museum to come to life at night. What I'm glad about is that this third film is not a rehash of the previous two; its predecessors had a similar theme of the main villain wanting the table,t which were different enough to enjoy but Secret of the Tomb does something completely different with its plot and execution which is an awesome change I enjoyed a lot. Of course, another thing we enjoy with these movies is the actual museum coming to life and they do some really cool stuff with that idea and it's awesome to see these historical figures interact with statues and even paintings!To make it even worse they recast the son, Nick, into this new actor who looks nothing like the other boy who probably would be of a somewhat comparable age so it's beyond me why they did it, but the far worse offense than simple recasting was to change the entire personality of the boy. For the previous two films, he was a good kid, precocious, close to his dad and loved that the museum came to live. Now he's a lazy, back- talking punk who wants to drop out of school. Underground DJ having wild parties at his dad's place at 3 in the morning and who seems to care less about the museum or any of its inhabitants. Why rewrite and ruin a character that way for some tromped up father/son angst that feels forced and falls terribly flat?I think that I know of I don't know. I would recommend it to my family. The rating of this movie is PG. This movie is good. If I could give this movie a grade it will be B-."
" review
",2017-10-01 00:00:00,10,"""Night at the Museum:Secret of the Tomb, Will have you monkeying around"" We all have those movies that is like school for us. Well this is one its historical and it's funny. I love it because i feel like i'm at school and that i'm learning a little bit more historyIn this movie they use an museum that's in New York and London. The main characters are Larry Daley(Ben Stiller),Theodore Roosevelt(Robin Williams),Ahkmenrah(Rami Malek),Nick Daley(Skyler Gisondo),and Dexter (Crystal The Monkey). This movie is about an tablet tomb that start dying because of it using too much of its magic,and the gang has to try and find out how to heal it.the actors did very well acting too i don't know how they made the dinosaurs came to life but it was cool.I liked how the movie was educational and funny at the same time and also how it brought excitement and how it kids and adults can learn a little history the actors did very well acting they did not mess up at all i like all the parts of the movie.I would recommend this to 10-35 years of age because of how much you can learn and cause of some content. I will give this movie a PG movie rate because of the type of history you can learn i will also give it an 5 star rating because of how wonderful it is."
" The farewell of Robin Williams.
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,5,"This is the third and final film of the trilogy ""Night at the Museum"" and takes place mostly in London, at the British Museum. The script consists of a hasty trip to the British capital in order to repair the Egyptian tablet, responsible for animating the figures and statues of the Museum of Natural History, New York. Larry is the right man at the right time, even though his connection to the museum is far more relevant now than a night watchman. The script, however, fails when it tries to create emotive subplots, an error that had already occurred in the previous movie. This time the problem is a no-point family conflict between Larry and his son, who is now a rebellious teenager. This does not interfere with the main plot and ends up being a loose string in the movie, perfectly expendable during the editing stage. More effective in this aim is Laaa's love interest in Tilly, the chubby night guard of the British Museum. Humor and jokes leave a little to be desired, as there is not much new material and old characters have already lost the joke. Its Rebel Wilson, in the role of Tilly, who gets the most memorable jokes along with Dan Stevens, who played Sir Lancelot. Still about the actors, this film retained almost all of the previous cast, notably Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Steve Coogan, Ricky Gervais and Dick Van Dyke, who makes a brief cameo such as Hugh Jackman, in the role of himself. This film, unfortunately, also marks the farewell of Robin Williams and Mickey Rooney, two actors who passed away before the film was released and are honored in the final credits. Thus ends this comic trilogy, with a well closed end that does not allow developments for the future."
