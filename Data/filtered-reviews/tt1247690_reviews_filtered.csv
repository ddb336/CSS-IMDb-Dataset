" Impressive how such an amazing cast can give an absolute bore
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,3,"What even was this movie? Characters walking around with grimacing look as if disconnected from the reality was still tolerable until everyone decided to kill each other or just die in the process. To add up to the tormenting plot, the cinematography is utterly dull and colorless making it an onerous task to finish the movie."
" Confused and boring
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,2,"Maybe people in the 1930s acted like this. I dont know, but then again no one alive today does so why ,make such a convoluted piece of garbage? The fact it's a 5 + is testimony to the star struck fans of Lawrence and/or Cooper who will give anything they are in 8+ stars and the other group who dont feel comfortable giving terrible movies 1 or 2 stars. Boring with both unappealing characters and plot lines the only way I elevated this from one star is the production values are excellent so if you turned the volume off it looks like a decent movie."
" Incredibly bad!
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,2,Hard to believe Cooper and Lawrence would be in such a poorly written movie. High school production quality. A waste of $5. and an hour.....Yes I skipped to the end.Not going to lose another hour of my life.
" The Smokey Mountains Are Beautiful
",2020-12-02 00:00:00,2,"The rest of this trash is pathetic! Jennifer Lawrence's performance lacks.... uh ...everything! Bradley was Just practicing for other things.
Save some life-time and pass this one up. Make cookies with the kids or vacuum the house. Either way, you will be ahead of those who endured the wrath of this sad presentation!
Chocolate chip is the best, Serena can't compete!"
" Ruined a perfectly good Story
",2020-12-02 00:00:00,2,"Preface: I love Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper, their chemistry in Silver Linings-IMPECCABLEWithin 2 scenes of J.Law she's too young for them role to be believable. Character called for history and age and she looks like a22yo trying to be a34yo wo success. Had movie showed a backstory for Selena I may have believed but there's literally no backstory, a girl with a bad wig horse ridding for at least 3 min during the beginning. Likewise Bradley Cooper too young or too pretty to play such a hardened driven and Experienced 'man'.Literally Still a great story but not a great movie.
Casting failed; Serena needed to be younger than Meryl Streep and much much Older than J.Lawrence for gods sake there are actresses out there with acting chops that should have played this part.Bradley Cooper was almost believable but should've been played by actors who are 40-50 and look like it.Director did great except for lighting scenes bc 1/2 movie looks like shot in a studio. Producers did a horrible job!!!! Producers did not cast correctly, did not care-I think y'all just dialed it in assuming you'd benefit wo any work just on the 2 headliners which I already said were missed cast. So suck it Producers."
" Awful
",2020-11-30 00:00:00,2,"Seriously one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The writing, the acting...absolutely horrible. Jesus Christ, what a waste of time! Dont do it to yourself!!"
" So good, we watched 2 nights in a row
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,10,I was shocked to come on here and see any bad reviews. Don't listen to that. Judge for yourself. My husband loves this movie so I watched and I can see why. Great story and great actors. I was going to buy it but saw it's free on Prime.
" The Script is Unactionable
",2020-10-11 00:00:00,10,"If it's not in the words, the words can't be acted. Besides the zero dialogue there is a downward plot line. Nobody can juice up a crashing development. Where did the director think the action was headed? The book got away with the tragic plot line , because when you read a tragedy you are able to read characters' thoughts, and in a film that dimension is lost. Let us be real here: When you just are married and see your husband has impregnated someone else, your marriage will fail. He didn't share that crucial information. And why should we the viewer care about him. And her reaction to that new knowledge makes this viewer lose interest. So right off I don't care. It's a terrible script. I give it a 10, because poor Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper must have suffered having to attempt to raise Lazarus from the dead all the way over in Romania for months! I blame the director."
" Wake me up !
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,2,"A disjointed snooze fest .. it seems as if they took a terrible Harlequin Romance novel , made it a period piece and topped it off with a few pretentious violas and for Christ sake just make it stop !!!!!!"
" Beautiful Scenery
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,4,Very overwrought story that just doesn't add up. Bradley Cooper gives it a shot but Jennifer Lawrence didn't seem right for the enigmatic Serena.
" Dark. Deep. And Gritty.
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,9,"JL excels as the obsessed, determined wife who has an objective and knows how to get it. Great performance. Bradley Cooper is the patsy who is fooled and tussles with the journey. Rhys Ifans steels the show as the cold, weirdo menace with ice in his veins. Underplayed. Well delivered. A great tale of betrayal and how not to get what you want. Actions have repercussions and you can make someone do what they don't want to do -- -- But it will end in tears. Excellent."
" Unfortunately Great
",2020-07-05 00:00:00,9,"I have just finished it and I am shocked how good the plot is. This movie reconfirmed to me that I absolutely love everything Jennifer Lawrence takes part in, and if Bradley Cooper is alongside her, then a deep and powerful story is promised. There are beautiful sceneries, plot twists, serious marital issues, and the way everything untangles in the end is just mindblowing."
" Slow and boring
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,5,Could haVe been a great story but this was not done well! I like the actors but the need to start picking better roles. I only finished it because I felt I had to. Sloooow and boring!
" Great movie...
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,8,"Good adaptation, it diverges a little from the original work, a book that seems to be fantastic, not needing alteration, which in my opinion fell short of the outcome written by the author, but the film is intense, I liked the feminine strength, but extremely ambitious and selfish ... Beautiful Cooper and Jennifer... Great movie..."
" Zzzzzzzzz, is it over yet??
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,2,If you like movies that are boring AF.... then this is the film for you!
" The only thing is good is acting of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,6,"No good story
No screenplay
No good directing
Just actors and actresses in this movie are good."
" A Low-Voltage Melodram (3.7)
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,4,"The movie heads were fast and complex minutes passed quickly trying to understand the movie.
I had a hard time controlling the issue because of the events mention briefly and not fully explain.It was a movie that I wondered after the cast, director and trailer. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence fit well as a couple and they proved and their movies are generally good but this time not I think it was an exception.The film has many bad features, such as complex narration, fast handling of events, inadequate story even the quality of the players cannot save them."
" Left out so much great information from the book
",2019-12-11 00:00:00,4,I absolutely loved the book by Ron Rash. i was so disappointed when I say the film and noticed that they had left so much out. The movie would have been so much better if they had stayed true to the book.
" Beautifully Shot but Ultimately Unengaging
",2019-10-14 00:00:00,6,"Book adaptations are notoriously tricky. Firstly, unless it's a short story, most books have far too much material for a tight film. This is compounded by the fact that the primary audience (those that loved the book) come with a weight of expectations that can be difficult to meet.
I've not read the book on which this film is based, but many of the comments suggest that both of these problems helped sink this one at the box office. Even I noticed the frenetic pace in some segments and the odd editing, as they tried to cram in as much as possible. Having said that, I thought that the cinematography was very impressive, and the acting was mostly fine (of course) and some of the scenes and subplots worked very well.
However, the moment at which I lost it was the struggle on the train... at which point I realised I really didn't care who killed whom, and whether the boy and his mother escaped or not. Clearly, I was supposed to hope that they would get away, and I think that, with a better balance of approach prior to this, the film would have built my sympathy accordingly. I wasn't exactly rooting for Rhys' character, but I'd have been OK if it had gone that way... In retrospect, therefore, perhaps they could have dumped some of the earlier scenes (such as the pointless she-gets-drunk-in-front-of his-business-buddies episode) and spend more time to build the backstory of why he cares for the boy's mother in the first place. Or maybe that's just me.
In any case, definitely worth seeing for the visuals and Cooper / Lawrence completists, and far from being a ""bad film"", but could have been much better."
" Don't watch
",2019-08-09 00:00:00,1,"Great cast beautifuly filmed
No real plot
Not worth watchin"
" A quiet, slow burning watch starring megastars before they were real big-hitters
",2019-08-07 00:00:00,7,"In Depression-era North Carolina, Pemberton (Bradley Cooper) fights to keep his flailing logging business afloat in order to make enough money to start of new life in Brazil with his enigmatic new wife, Serena (Jennifer Lawrence).The town sheriff is suspicious of Pemberton's dirty dealings and increasing pressure to mark the area a national park sees the ambitious businessman turn to his wife for increasingly destructive support and direction.Serena is billed as a period drama centred around the bleak prospects of a small town and all those trapped within her but in reality it's a much more sophisticated character study of the deeply complicated title role herself.The Depression era setting is really an extended metaphor for the inescapable darkness of Serena's damaged personality. Having suffered a soul stamping tragedy as a child and left unable to love (by her own admission) each new opportunity or friendly face is terminated by her manipulative neediness and, eventually, brute force.Her one genuine connection is with the curmudgeonly Galloway (Rhys Ifans) an equally disturbed and quietly menacing character who tends to her every warped whim like a loyal lap dog. What at first seems a perfect union between Pemberton and Serena horrifyingly unravels as each turn to competitively desperate measures to get what they need.Although both Lawrence and Cooper more than handle their complex roles, Serena could've been a big hitter with more established, serious actors in their place. A quiet, slow burning watch."
" Better than the review scores
",2019-07-22 00:00:00,7,I was nearly put off watching this by the low scores. Glad I watched it because your never disappointed with Bradley and Jennifer. Humbling storyline and lovely scenery. Tense in places and surprising in others. Didn't like the ending but won't spoil anything. Just a good film to watch...
" Tedious And Depressing
",2019-06-29 00:00:00,5,"SerenaThis movie too heavily relied upon the chemistry between the two leads, as we know both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are nuanced method actors with vast palettes to draw upon. They certainly threw their all behind this project that raised it from mediocre to just about bearable.The problems with this film are the script and the direction, I will detail the main failings:1, to really believe it is a love affair the two leads had to had a good time and enjoy being in each other's company and live large.2, the whole movie was so flat it was just unrelentingly miserable.3, the music was a dirge throughout.4, her metaphor was that of an Eagle, I laughed as this infers Bradley is the rattle snake, his metaphor of macho action in hunting a puma was just a silly diversion5, Jennifer struggled to decide under the direction which face to go for and we had the same trouble reading it.6, he killed his rival and she sought to kill hers but no child was a rival to her so this just didn't cut it.Overall 5/10"
" Good and Bad
",2019-06-17 00:00:00,5,I liked the movie despite it's many problems in almost every category. It reminds me of Heaven's Prisoners (1996) which I also liked despite it's many problems.
" Bad plot great actors
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,6,I did read the book before watching movie and I was disappointed so I didn't expected from the movie much. In the movie Bradley and Jennifer were perfect but the plot is pretty bad that even best actors couldn't save it. I gave 6 just because I love Jennifer and Bradley.
" Why all the bad reviews?
",2019-01-07 00:00:00,10,I only write the review because of the super bad ratings. This movie was outstanding. Jennifer Lawrence at her best! Just forget about the book already.
" Crap fest
",2018-12-15 00:00:00,1,"Sloppy film, too much soft porn, just boring. Wasted my time thinking this was gonna be interesting but nope."
" love can effect business
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you that there was still some strong business during the depression also that marriage is always a risk whether or not it is worth it is a different story. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also all in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" I DID IT FOR US
",2018-09-09 00:00:00,7,"Some might consider this review to contain SPOILERS because I give out as much information as does the previews.George Pemberton (Bradley Cooper) runs a failing lumber camp in North Carolina during the depression era. With most of his fortune wiped out and there is a movement to make a National Park out of the forests he is cutting down, he marries Serena (Jennifer Lawrence). Serena was raised on a lumber camp and knows the business. She comes in and starts to run things to the dismay of Buchanan (David Dencik), George's unmarried partner who she thinks is gay. Also there is Rachel (Ana Ularu) a girl who is pregnant with George's child.It isn't long before Serena is pregnant. By the time she starts showing, Rachel's child is a toddler, something that didn't fit into any real time line. As life closes in on our happy couple, who spend half their time on screen acting like rabbits, they show their true colors, which aren't very pretty.Not their best film together. Their chemistry wasn't recreated.No f-bombs or nudity. Cooper and Lawrence go at it quite a bit on screen."
" I can't say I finished, so I won't give it a good or bad review, but...
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,5,"I had to turn off after twenty minutes of Jennifer Lawrence's amazing growing-then-shrinking hair-do. I just couldn't take it seriously, despite the stellar cast."
" Time to think, ponder and reflect
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,7,"Time to think and reflect, time to ponder. Opportunity to reflect on the darkness of suffering hearts, feeling of misery and love slowly turning into madness - thats how it felt in smokey mountains, a classical greek tragedy, but with entangled stories!"
" Read the novel!
",2018-06-14 00:00:00,4,"I've never seen a more severely distorted movie adaptation from a novel than with Serena. The saga written by Ron Rash paints a picture of a Serena we never see on screen. She is independent, fierce, and unsympathetic from the first scene in the book. She is always in control; if by chance something takes her off guard, she strikes back quickly. 
There's a reason the novel is simply called Serena, not George Pemberton's Wife has a Breakdown. To read it is to be intrigued by a multifaceted, engaging woman."
" Mills & Boon Tale
",2018-04-26 00:00:00,3,"Two of America's finest actors cannot save this highly produced Mills-and-Boon tale set in 1930s Carolina. After half an hour of multiple micro-scenes that never allow the characters or the plot to truly develop, I gave up."
" A dour playbook
",2018-04-26 00:00:00,3,"So soon after the Silver Linings Playbook, you would have thought the teaming up of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence would hit pay dirt at the box office.Set in 1929 Great Smoky Mountains in Carolina after the Wall Street Crash. George Pemberton (Bradley Cooper) and his business partner try to keep their logging company afloat. The bank have taken his vast lands in Brazil as collateral. The local Sheriff (Toby Jones) and his associates want to buy up his land and turn it into parkland. Pemberton quickly falls in love with glamorous Serena (Jennifer Lawrence) and marries her. Serena has an aptitude for business and to pus George to the edge with amoral means, this means murder as both strive to be successful. However a child that George has had with another woman tips Serena over the edge.The film is rather inert, the story has a tragic tinged moodiness but never really gets going. A cast full of British actors tells you that it was shot somewhere in eastern Europe. Both Cooper and Lawrence feel ill at ease with their characters.Director Susanne Bier has made a misfire yet atoned for this by directing the wonderful spy thriller for BBC television, The Night Manager."
" Regretfully watched it
",2018-03-01 00:00:00,1,"First off, another movie with B. Cooper and J. Lawrence together? Getting kind of played out but that really was not the issue with the movie. Moving on, the script was very awkward, generic, and full of clichés. Several of the outdoor scenarios were highly unrealistic and just plain silly but highly predictable nonetheless. It was a rough draft patched together with half-baked subplots that didn't make a lot of sense and were more of a distraction than adding value. There were a few moments the film got interesting and showed promise, such as the conflict between Bradley's character and his business partner, his conflict about his son with another woman from a past love and his current relationship, but they never developed the real interesting nuggets of the story. The whole time I wondered where the film was taking me to realize there was just really no story here.The acting was stilted and automaton. It was as if Bradley and Jennifer weren't into the roles but did it anyway and wanted to get it over with. Even the animals seemed out of place and not genuine. The directing was poorly executed and the scenes seemed like they were rushed and moved along. The movie just got worse as it climaxed with an attempt at drama that fell flat leaving me with no impact other than waiting for the movie to end."
" I thought it was a good movie.
",2017-11-01 00:00:00,7,"Jennifer Lawrence is great (as always), and that alone is enough for me to rate the movie as good -- but I also think the story is interesting and original. It is better than most other films, including the ones that are shown over and over on cable channels. I am surprised that so many people are so critical of it. (I had seen a script on line before seeing the movie, and I was surprised that the ending was different. I like the original ending better.)"
" Not impressed
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,3,"Disappointing They lost me right off the bat with the 2014 clothes and hair especially the current ""I forgot to shave"" that is so popular now, would have never happened in 1929 and certainly not within the circles he was supposed to be circulating in. Why do they allow this crap? The plot was predictable and overall pretty lame"
