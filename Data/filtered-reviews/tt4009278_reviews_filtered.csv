" I mean I would too
",2021-03-30 00:00:00,4,They got what they deserved. Acting could have been better but for very few characters it was good.
" I watched it so you didn't have to
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,4,"This movie has more holes than swiss cheese. I only watched it because I ran out of good movies on netflix and prime. If you want to turn your brain off and kill some time, fine there are worse movies. But if you read the plot summary they only left out one small part that you won't care about by the time you get there."
" Awesome Beginning... Pathetic Ending!
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,5,"From Suspenseful to Pathetic.
Ann gave you a mixture of emotions, you want from feeling pity to rooting for her, to wanting her to just jump out the window and end it already! She can't go outside or even run when the criminal throws her out daring her to run, but she can just walk outside after she finally kills them all? okay. If she had've just ran outside to begin with or go to her brothers funeral there wouldn't be a movie then would it?! OK, I get it! However, Ann needed to make up her damned mind. Are you going to be strong, fight, & Kick Ass! Or you going to be a crybaby for 2 hours. Anns emotions were all over the place, and then after awhile it just got annoying. You know it's bad when you find yourself rooting for the bad guy to just take her out already and end her misery because she was so pathetic. Another part I hated, talking too much to the friend bringing her food, why would you tell this guy you have money and then offer him a big bag of money!? Are you that damn weak minded and hard up for friends, are you that lonely? It was just stupid! And what does he do, go tell his friends, who come back and rob you. Not even a child would do something so stupid! I don't care if you are recluse or not. Being a recluse does not make you automatically stupid! In Ann's case, it was."
" Great twist
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,8,"Exciting movie with a great twist.
Very entertaining and thrilling.
Acting is great and very believable."
" Flawed
",2021-02-15 00:00:00,1,"Nobody demands realism in movies or tv anymore. We accept empty cups, empty shopping bags, (all Hallmark movies) 2 sisters with different color eyes, or 6 inch height diffetence between siblings or dad and sons etc, etc, etc. So we are numb to absurdities like this movie. As if some guy could construct disappearing steps, steel doors set in steel frames, automatic lock systems, hydraulics, automatic locks, a metal chifferobe, unlocking and opening up on command. All from a handheld wireless command box??? Maybe.....maybe if a team of MIT engineers who hardwired these things could get these things to work from a main panel at a massive expense and weeks of installation. And where did this guy go and buy 3 feet by 5 feet bulletproof glass?? And have it so well installed? It would be like 200 pounds, very expensive, and where would you get it? How could one man take it down and lift it to install it? You could not have a crew do this as they are told to report any construction to police that looks like a torture chamber or anything weird. Its all ludicrous!! Not a bad movie otherwise, although not one likeable person in it. Not even the supposed victim."
" shock at every turn
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,7,Wow i was going into this thinking it was going to be a crappy movie but i was wrong. i started it thinking i knew what was going to happen but i was proven wrong with every guess. this movie has every plot twist and turn you can think of which keeps you on the edge of your seat. very good not the beat movie ever but for killing some time and to be surprised you may like it. definitely worth the watch.
" Submitted For Your Approval......
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,6,Love it that the food delivery guy used good old Rod Serling quote when delivering food....+1 Star for a Great Line!!Okay so some home invaders invade a home when the owner is not supposed to be home. She's supposed to be at a funeral Overall I think the premise was kinda interesting. A good twisty little home invasion movie and the ending was satisfactory. 6/10
" Solid thriller
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,6,Entertaining and unpredictable with good acting. I would give 6/10
" Home invasion thriller with a neat difference
",2020-12-08 00:00:00,8,"Three guys break into the house of agoraphobe Anna Rook (a fine and credible performance by Beth Riesgraf), who it turns out isn't nearly as helpless as she outwardly appears to be.Director Adam Schindler not only relates the riveting story at a steady pace, but also adroitly generates a substantial amount of claustrophobic tension. The clever script by T.J. Comfel and David White provides a real doozy of a cool twist that also proves to be surprisingly poignant as well. Riesgraf dominates the movie with her strong and impressive portrayal of a psychologically troubled woman who's also one lethal, formidable, and ultimately pitiable tragic figure. The rest of the cast are likewise rock-solid: Rory Culkin as friendly delivery boy Dan Cooper, Jack Kesy as ruthless ringleader J.P. Henson, Martin Starr as the edgy and dangerous Perry Cuttner, and Joshua Mikel as the reluctant Vance. An on the money little nail-biter."
" same old same old
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,5,"Decent story , decent twists, decent acting, decent effects, decent thriller.
this is about as average a film as you can get, there is a lot better versions of this out there........."
" Good Concept - OK Movie, not as bad as the ratings will have you believe
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,6,"One could see that the movie maker was just excited about the concept enough to make a movie around it - had he explored the concept a little more, this may have very well become another ""Saw"" franchise. The first half was exciting, I was filled with extreme curiosity but then, it just ended like a normal movie."
" What a twist!
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,8,"This movie blew me away, when you break into someone's house, be ready for this sick woman."
" Decent
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,6,"The movie was ok. I only watched it as a fan of Rory Culkin.
Overall, I was entertained and Rory Culkin was amazing as usual."
" A solid and enjoyable thriller
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,6,"Anna (Beth Riesgraf) suffers from agoraphobia. When a group of burglars infiltrate her house, she cannot bring herself to leave and is stuck inside with them. However, there's a lot more to Anna's psyche that the criminals were not expecting. It's Director Adam Schindler's debut feature film and it's well put together with convincing performances from the whole cast and particularly good from Riesgraf who captures the anxious feeling of the condition well. Martin Starr (Adventureland, Knocked Up) is quite refreshing to see in a different role from what he has played in the past; here being an almost psychopathic criminal. Rory Culkin (Signs, Mean Creek) is also very good as Dan; a food delivery man for Anna's brother and who holds strong feelings for her. It's a pretty cool twist to the home invasion genre that we've seen in films such as I Spit On Your Grave and Hard Candy to a certain extent. I would have liked to have seen the narrative delve into the claustrophobic horror more and explore the more disturbing aspects of the story to make a more visceral watch but alas it's played out more as a drama with sharp edges and occasionally wince-inducing injury detail. Even so, it's still entertaining to see what Anna is going to do next and watch the mystery unfold, tapping into the darker corners of the audiences imagination"
" Worth Checking Out
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,8,"I found this movie searching for Rory Culkin movies on Prime.
It's about an agoraphobic woman who is about to be robbed by her trusted take-out delivery boy.
It seemed a little long and a tad bit basic at first. Then it went in a direction I didn't realize it would!
I won't do any spoilers here but this one is definitely worth your while if you're in the market for an independent horror flick!"
" Anna has agoraphobia...bad
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,6,"Anna has agoraphobia so bad that when her home is broken into and her life threatened she still cannot run out. Her only choice is to deal with her intruders inside her home, and thankfully there are lots of rooms in which to do so. This was great fun to follow the logic and also the lack thereof, I mean, who among us is always ruled by logic, especially in highly stressful states. My only beef is with the very last minute. I don't get that ending, at the end there."
" Sometimes the criminals do get what they deserve.
",2020-02-21 00:00:00,6,Interesting what happens when you break into a house and try to rob a crazy person. Sometimes the criminals do get what they deserve.
" Harrowing display of a survivor.
",2019-12-01 00:00:00,8,"Agoraphobic woman is tested by home invaders. After losing her brother to cancer, Anna is left without any connection to the world except for the Meals on Wheels delivery man and her deceased brother's lawyer. That is when the home invasion begins. Her strength to withstand the situation displays how much a person can tolerate from past abuse, how much someone is willing to do to survive in the moment. And it depicts (albeit in a highly Hollywood style) how the psyche can be twisted from childhood abuse. Repetition of the trauma at its finest in an attempt to rid the mind of its ghosts even though no memory can be erased completely."
" Good movie, bad language
",2019-11-20 00:00:00,1,"Its a good movie but they cuss wayyy to much, especially when they say Gods name in vain many times. Why do people think they have to have cussing in a horror movie or movie period? Didn't see any nudity which is suprising but glad it didnt."
" Thriller and interesting character study
",2019-10-10 00:00:00,8,"Cast: Beth Riesgraf, Jack Kesy, Martin Starr, Rory Culkin, Leticia Jimenez, Joshua Mike"
" Extremely interesting Plot
",2019-09-29 00:00:00,7,For sure worth the watch; especially if you're looking for a film with no nudity which is hard to find these days. Extremely fun for Halloween!
" Great Movie, good pace and full of twists
",2019-08-05 00:00:00,10,Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It does start off a little slow but then picks up fast and doesn't stop until the end. It's full of twists that have you guessing until the end. Great adaptation to home invasion style movies. Highly recommend for any horror fan.
" A Woman Who Never Goes Anywhere
",2019-07-23 00:00:00,6,"This movie is about Anna, who never steps outside the house. That's her phobia. She takes care of her sick brother, until one day he dies. The story begins the day of his funeral, when she still stays at home. Not expecting her, three men intrudes to a burglary. But they are in for a shock.The movie makes you wonder at time and also makes you feel sick as Anna tells her part of the story. The movie had much more potential than was exploited. It's a sure one time watch.Not great but good enough."
" Good.... And
",2019-05-13 00:00:00,7,"This movie was pretty good overall. The highlight was Beth Riesgraf. Never saw her before, outstanding performance."
" A home invasion shapeshifts
",2019-03-24 00:00:00,4,"A French-Canadian psychological thriller; A story about an agoraphobic woman who is visited upon by intruders. A twist makes the narrative more interesting, turning a taut but conventional woman-in-jeopardy situation into something more unpredictable and dark. It's an efficiently composed indie suspenser with solid performances and a good pace, but it has a distasteful sensibility and it fails the thrills test."
" Meh...you could do worse.
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,5,Pros: Decent script that answered all my questions. Good acting. Not entirely predictable.Cons: Hard to root for any of the characters the longer you watch. The ending left something to be desired despite the apparent attempt at symbolism. (What about the money? She has no life skills to survive!!)
" Not a horror film
",2018-11-03 00:00:00,1,"Yet more wishy washy wannabe horror film stuff which fails even as a thriller. It's basically just another one of these films that pretends to be scary but in the end tries to express true ""horror"" (or so they think) by delving into some asinine attempt at deep psychology. The people praising it are mainstream types who haven't really seen anything."
" Intruder Alert! Intruder Alert!
",2018-10-02 00:00:00,5,"Preparing for the Horror Challenges on various boards,I looked for a short and sweet opening flick. Looking round on eBay, I spotted a tense-looking Home Invasion Horror, which led to me joining the intruders.View on the film:In the opening set-up, writers David White & T.J. Cimfel hint at the minimalist menace that Mike Flanagan would bring to the Home Invasion genre with the nail-biting horror Hush (2016),with the writers offering POV glimpses into Anna's agoraphobia, and keeping the thieves nameless and threatening. Giving the non-wealthy Anna countless panic rooms/pre-made traps, the writers quickly take the movie off the boil, by giving Anna the advantage early on,and making the robbers look like pushovers. Unlocking Anna's past, the writers aim to give a depth to the reasoning behind Anna's revenge attacks, (filmed with blood and camera moves seeping across the house by editor/director Adam Schindler and cinematographer Eric Leach) which instead cuts the film with an ill-fitting mean atmosphere, due to the change of Anna from innocent to an unlikeable avenger being given no time to subtly build-up. Entering with ""creep"" stamped on his forehead, Rory Culkin gives a slithering performance as invader Dan Cooper, whilst Beth Riesgraf cuts Anna with a merciless, frosty edge to take on the intruders."
" Fool's Gold
",2018-09-15 00:00:00,3,"The trailer was like, yea (I do know that trailers nowadays usually show the only interesting parts in a movie). This one gives up the entire movie basically. This movie was all over the place, unbelievable in many parts. The writer was like, hey, I got an idea and I'm just gonna write what comes to mind. I don't even know what type of movie it was by the movie's end."
" ""He WAS Your Friend! Now, He's A Doorstop!""...
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,7,"INTRUDERS first introduces us to Anna (Beth Riesgraf) and her terminally ill brother, Conrad (Timothy McKinney). His death leaves Anna alone in their enormous house, where three criminals (Jack Kesy, Martin Starr, and Joshua Mikel) soon break in. Anna was supposed to be at Conrad's funeral, but she suffers from agoraphobia, resulting in her inability to leave her home.At first, the thieves are in control, with Anna doing her best to evade capture. However, neither Anna nor her house are what they appear to be, and the situation changes rapidly. The story evolves from a more typical thriller, into something more unexpected, with some big twists added for suspense.For the most part, Ms. Riesgraf plays her role with subtlety, instead of going the ""bug-eyed maniac"" route. The home invaders are fairly standard, with one being the ""explosive / psychopathic"" type, another being the ""weak link"" type, and the third being more rational and strong. Of course, there's not much in the way of character development, but that's in keeping with the trend in modern cinema.Not a bad way to spend a movie night..."
" Keeps you guessing
",2018-07-06 00:00:00,8,I love Beth Riesgraf. I thought she did an amazing job portraying the character. Twist and turns on every part that I thought was predictable. Looking forward for more of her movies and shows. #RisingStar
" Worth Watching
",2018-06-29 00:00:00,6,"Everyone has already given a synopsis of the movie. I would have to say that I was entertained by this movie and watched it through until the end. While not a perfect script by any imagination, it was sufficiently thrilling to hold my attention and I would recommend it."
" Enjoyable movie!
",2018-06-24 00:00:00,8,"Yes, as others have said, it's the old female revenge meme, but with a different take. I didn't really like the ending, I could thing of a few different ways to end the movie that would have been more satisfying. So, this woman lives in this house, and apparently she has inherited a lot of money. And her brother dies. Now she's alone. And she has agoraphobia, she's afraid to leave the house.Then, people come in to steal her money. What the intruders don't know is that... she has some, shall we say... problems... ! I search long and hard to find a good movie, usually to be disappointed, but this is a good one. As others have said, it's more thriller than horror. Needless to say, problems and difficulties ensue for all involved...Fun to the very end."
" Home invasion with a twist
",2018-05-31 00:00:00,5,"UK title - Shut In. Three men break into a large house looking for a stash of cash, thinking that it's occupant, Anna, is away at her brother's funeral. But she isn't, the tables get turned and victim becomes the hunter.
Certainly not a typical home invasion movie, this one turns into something more akin to say ""Saw"". It's pretty brutal and despite what she does you still have to side with Anna. However the villains aren't terribly convincing, especially the guy with the beard. Saw it free on TV, it's not bad but I'd not want to watch it again."
" More than just your typical revenge film
",2018-04-27 00:00:00,7,"Shut In (AKA Intruders): Anna (Beth Riesgraf) suffers from chronic agoraphobia. She has just nursed her brother in his final illness but is unable to leave the house to attend his funeral. Expecting nobody to be at home, three men burgle the house. Anna hides but is discovered by the intruders as she cannot flee the building. One burglar, Perry (Martin Starr) is psychotic and drags her outside as a form of torture. Anna however has other strengths and inflicts a reversal of fortune the crooks. Combat then ensues with the house as the battlegroundA rather savage film, more than just your typical revenge film, Anna truly has a dark side of her own. Agoraphobia isn't her only issue. Even the house itself has it's surprises. A few rather disturbing scenes so this is not a movie for the squeamish or faint of heart. Effective Horror/Thriller with perhaps some unlikely developments. 6.5/10"
" One of my Favorite Home invasion movies
",2018-03-31 00:00:00,10,"I rarely if ever write a review but I watch an insane amount of movies as I have MS and am housebound.
This movie has inspired me to at last do a review or give my opinion.I have watched many a ""Home Invasion"" movie.
This one was different ,which is always good it kept my interest from start to finish and had me hanging on to see what would happen next.
I was so into this movie I needed to go to toilet at one stage and forgot I could just pause it , so I held on till the end for about 45 more minutes.
That is how engrossed in the movie I was.My 2 favorite Home Invasion style movies in recent years are ""Hush"" and ""The Strangers""
I rate this movie up there with those 2.
Like Hush it has an added element to it.
The main star being agoraphobic was fun to watch and how the movie turned from her seeming to be scared for her life and a helpless pretty young woman, to at times a heartless in control maniacal crazy person.
I loved it.
I liked how they tied in the story about her brother, they could of mentioned more about her father early on before the brother died.
The movie had me yelling out to my brother saying you must watch this.
I watch basically only Horror/Thriller/Drama/Supernatural movies. So for me to give a 10 I must be moved by it and find self wanting to talk to people about it. This movie gave me that feeling.I did kind of want to see Rory Culkin's character not leave at the end or leave with the Lead as he seemed to have a crush on her. It was a oh no moment when he popped up in the middle of the film. Like oh no you.
You go from feeling sorry for Charlotte to wondering how many people has she played these crazy games with. 
She was good at portraying to the bad guys that she was helpless even so much that she could not bring self to call the police but then you see the tables turn. In the end I would of liked to have seen her struggle still to leave the house after setting the fire. Instead of walking out so fine. Like her illness was just released all of a sudden and she felt normal. 
As with a lot of movies it finishes making you wonder what happened next. Did she walk off away free and start a life elsewhere, did the Police pick her up on the road somewhere or did she take the bad guys vehicle and drive off somewhere. All in all I cannot recommend this enough. It never got boring and was fun to watch throughout.
A must see for all ."
" Felt more like a thriller than a horror
",2017-12-28 00:00:00,6,"Very interesting premise and this is definitely a watchable film. The acting isn't overtly bad, it's actually decent, but I just felt it didn't fulfil what films with similar premises (e.g you're next) did. As stated in the title, this felt more like a thriller than a horror, to some extent comparable to gone girl - in terms of the questionable/morally grey protagonist. Would I recommend? Yes. It doesn't quite go to the places a solid 7+ rating would achieve, but nevertheless an engaging and enjoyable psychological thriller"
" The house that fear built
",2017-11-16 00:00:00,7,"In Intruders, a severely agoraphobic young lady (Beth Riesgraf) is menaced by three baddies in search of cash somewhere in her home. But this isn't a standard home-invasion flick, and she's not the standard victim, either. This Intruders contains a devilish twist about midway through, and suddenly this isn't a movie about a damsel in distress but something wholly different – and much more interesting.Anna (Riesgraf) lives in an old house with her brother Conrad, who's quickly dying of some disease. The two have lived in the house by themselves since their father passed away some ten years earlier, but Anna has developed a paralyzing fear of the outside. She can't even open the door without hyperventilating.Conrad dies very early in the film. The only other person Anna has been in contact with over the past decade has been the faithful delivery boy from Meals on Wheels, Dan (Rory Culkin). A few days before Conrad's death, Dan and Anna discuss the possibility of either leaving their small town for bigger and better things. When Dan says he'd love to strike out on his own somewhere, Anna offers him a sackful of cash. Which Dan turns down.A quick fast-forward to the days after Conrad's death. It's time for the funeral. Anna doesn't go, despite the pleadings of her brother's lawyer. And then, while she's at home doing pretty much nothing, a couple of vehicles pull up in her driveway and men enter the house. They don't know she's there. Because she's not supposed to be there.Riesgraf's Anna is no shrinking violet. At the same time, the thugs aren't exactly one dimensional themselves, with each character carefully defined without being a stereotype. Perhaps this affair won't be as one sided as it initially appeared. After all, this is Anna's home turf.I found Intruders to be fairly brilliant, with a neat twist on a standard plot that ultimately transforms the film from a pile of predictability to a tsunami of terror and guessing."
" This movie is a great watch, but a bad review
",2017-10-14 00:00:00,5,"PROS: The acting was pretty solid in this film. I enjoyed how unwavering the characters were when it came to expressing pain. Pain is such a hard emotion to show especially 100% of the time, so I give credit to the actors here. I also love how fitting the movie cover is.CONS: For me the largest problem would be the extreme amount of plot holes. This movie goes from one basic idea and completely dumps that idea and goes with a whole new one. The transition itself was not done with tact nor was it helpful at all. As soon as you got comfortable the director took away any stability established in the film. There were just so many confusing attributes. As soon as they introduced a different plot line they abandoned the other one, and that was the biggest problem. Once a new plot line gets developed it's key to keep the first plot line because a good movie should build off the first one to get to the second one. Therefore, you ended up getting an ending that didn't go together with any of the character development or structure of the movie. www.chorror.com"
" Surprisingly good
",2017-05-24 00:00:00,10,"This one surprised me. It was taunt, well-directed, paced well and the actors did outstanding work. Beth Reisgraf as Anna was amazing! She sold the character so well. On a scale of 1 to 10, I wanted to give this one a 20! Nothing is given away until the right moment in the action. There is death and violence but it is not out of place for the plot. The director is to be complimented for keeping the story well paced and without any of the characters having to act stupid to make the story work. I liked the movie so much that I immediately ordered a copy from Amazon. It is worth it."
" Intruders beware
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,7,Stumbled on while cruising stations for a flick break. This one caught my curiosity off guard. Starts you off in one direction that gets you wondering where the story is leading and slowly reveals the real powers at play. Acting is above average and the suspense will keep you watching.
" Only if the movie was as good as the trailer
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,5,"Last year I was tempted to buy a good home invasion movie on DVD to treat myself. I came upon the trailer for 'Intruders 2015' online. I found it to be very intriguing as well as it gave away some of the highlights of the movie itself. Not to forget that it was from the executive producer of 'Insidious', I immediately ordered it being well aware that it had a low rating. But was I in for a surprise once I felt unsatisfied with the outcome. 'Intruders' at first glance just seems like any other average home invasion movie. But here the protagonist has a mental illness of agoraphobia. This actually sets up the premise for the remainder of the film.Directed by Adam Schindler who as yet has nothing notable to his bio, makes a decent film. In the directing department he has shown potential. But with a week script, he had not much to work with. The usual 'woman in peril as thieves want to rob her' has been done countless times. At the time of it's release other similar movies such as ' Don't Breathe' and 'Hush' were more superior in terms of script and execution. Perhaps that is the reason for this film's poor performance. The main character turns against the thieves and gets the upper advantage by using hidden passage ways and rooms to keep them captive. Eventually she kills them. The second half moves at a much slower pace before the twist in the climax is revealed. If I ever met the writer I would certainly like to ask him how a woman with such a mental illness was able to fight. And how exactly were molesters were lured to the house? All said and done this is an average movie with good performances from all the actors. That is the saving grace but generic explanations for the twist ending is difficult to swallow."
" The offbeat sociopathic girl .
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,7,"I liked the movie at the beginning but not much at the ending scenes , however i appreciate the brilliant submitted efforts especially that 'Beth Riesgraf' made in attempt to portray the 'Anna Rook' psychopathic character , I can't deny that the movie was very suspenseful and exciting but nevertheless you will feel tiny holes and flaws in both sides , the character and the plot , with regard to the character i couldn't discern or distinguish her psychological problem yet , is she a psychopath or sociopath or just an introvert photosensitive person , you will understand when you see the movie , but even if the director intention was to make a psychopathic character i'd like to notify him that he was good but not good enough ' i don't really know who's to blame but there's an obvious incomplete side of the psychopathic character that she tried to portray to us , and concerning the plot aspect i think it wasn't something new for me , it wasn't really a unique scenario that worth the 10 out 10 vote , that's why i gave it only 7 out of ten just for the brilliant efforts of the actors . Thank you ."
