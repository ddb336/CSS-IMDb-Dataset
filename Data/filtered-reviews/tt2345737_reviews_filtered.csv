" Like a more brutal, realistic Mad Max...
",2021-04-03 00:00:00,8,"If Max had no conscience, had a John Wick complex, and willing to kill anyone at a moment's notice, you might get Guy Pearce's character from The Rover.The thing is, the movie doesn't go to any lengths at all to reveal the motivations of the character. All we know is that he's intent on getting his car back, and the criminal gang who took it will have wrath to pay.Robert Pattinson turns in the most surprising performance of the film as a literal half-wit criminal. If you were completely unfamiliar with Pattinson's work up until now, this would probably be a revelation for you.However, given Pattison's past exploits, it is difficult to ignore that in the face of his performance here, but the performance really does absolve the actor of his Twilight escapades by hiding Pattinson's affectations out of sight as the sympathetic Ray.This isn't a typical Hero's Journey tale, nor is it a traditional revenge tale.This is a harsh, uncompromising, unfiltered road-thriller where there are no good guys here.The biggest difference between this and the Mad Max series is that Mad Max films always promise hope in some form fashion or way, as well as either redemption or revenge for a wrong (or many wrongs) committed.The Rover isn't like that.It's a brilliant film nonetheless, even with its sparse dialogue from Pearce and an obvious lack of exploration around Pearce's motivation. Even still, the beautiful cinematography, the brief tapestry of a dystopian Australia through imagery rather than dialogue, and the uncompromising violence are reason enough to give this one a watch.You won't be disappointed."
" Absolutely BRILLIANT!
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,10,"I've never been a fan of ""Twilight Boy"", but I gotta say his performance in this film is some of the BEST Acting I've seen since ""Slingblade""! Pattinson is BRILLIANT in this Movie! And Guy Pearce is his usual SUPER INTENSE Self! This was a FANTASTIC Movie! I just can't get over Patinsons Performance, just AMAZING! Every ""tick, every quirk"" was SPOT ON! I have a new Respect for this kid !DONT MISS This one!!!!!"
" Great
",2021-02-23 00:00:00,10,One of my all time best films.This movie and The Proposition is why i rate Guy Pearce so highly.Realistically done and plausible everyone is good in it.A must see modern Aussie classic.
" great movie
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,8,"There is a ton of silence and high tension in that fantastic thriller. ""fear the man, who has nothing to lose"" describes the movie and especially the role of Guy Pearce perfectly. he plays that one guy who doesn't talk a lot, and who is extremely angry inside. he would die to get back what has been stolen from a bunch of idiots: his car. that sounds ridiculous but it's not. you will understand if you watch that movie. Pattinson plays a guy with a low IQ and does it well. this is a must-watch movie."
" ? What was this?
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,1,"Can't think of a more pointless movie. I'm sure there are more, I'm just not aware of them."
" Near perfect Western road movie post apocalyptic character study
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,9,"I love this film. In my top 25 films and so sad it's never reached a bigger audience.
Guy Pearce, a much underrated actor, delivers a performance of a human who has lost everything and the sense that nothing will ever matter again seeps out of every pore in every frame. He is ably supported by every actor on screen, the pros and an ensemble of locals, but it's the extraordinary performance from Robert Pattinson - his first following the Twilight Films - that heralded what a great actor he was and would show to be in subsequent films. He is virtually unrecognisable here.
His portrayal of a desperately sad, probably educationally delayed, man child is heart wrenching alongside the sheer brutality of Pearce's lost soul.
The direction is perfect. The long opening shots tell you all you need to know about this place and this man. The landscape and photography do the rest.
Mad Max this isn't, and all the better for it."
" The grimness is all there is.
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,4,"It starts grim, it ends grim. The locations are beautifully photographed, and the minimalist score helps convey the bleakness and isolation of the piece. Guy Pearce growls intensely through his brief bouts of dialogue as Eric, and Robert Pattinson is effective as slow-minded Rey.It is all very one note. When grimness is all there is, and there's no lightness or shocks to break it up, the film becomes sadly dull. I found myself drifting away quite often, and I wasn't given the impression I missed anything.Others liked this, and that's great; but for me, I found it a bit of a chore. My score is 4 out of 10."
" A father/son story
",2020-10-20 00:00:00,8,"Yes, it is the end of the world, yes the car of the protagonist is stolen but what it is not being said is that a father/son story. It's difficult to arrive at this conclusion because the brother kind of fills the role of the father in this scenario. However, 70% of the movie is about this man looking for his car that has to shepherd this other guy (not his son but use your imagination) and in the meantime be his father for a while.
It is in the end the brutish world of the apocalypse but I like to think people will show compassion and empathy and that's not that bad!"
" All the guy wanted is to play some vidya games
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,9,"If you don't understand that, you probably won't enjoy this great film.Also, it is very slow so the characters become well developed, Guy Pearce is his usual top notch self, and I didn't even know it was Robert Pattinson until I watched the credits.It is really, really good."
" Gritty AF
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,8,"Phenomenal performance from Guy Pearce, got a new found respect for him.
Absorbing and riveting from start to finish, only right at the End do u realise what it was really about.
A must-watch Movie you'll NEVER forget üëèüèæüò≤"
" ""Not everything has to be about something""
",2020-08-25 00:00:00,2,"This is one of the most incomprehensible and incoherent movies I have seen. So much of this movie doesn't make sense that it became infuriating to me. I understand the premise of the movie, a sort of low rent ""Mad Max"", but the script contains so many plot holes you could drive the freight train that appears during the course of the movie (for no apparent reason) through them.I have always liked Guy Pearce, and he is one of the reasons I gave this movie a chance, however he sleepwalks through the role he is lumbered with, his underplaying made all the more apparent next to the outrageous overacting of Pattinson.This movie is so nihilistic (something which the ending only emphasizes) that it left me with a feeling of emptiness and disappointment.Watch it only to confirm how much of a waste of time it is."
" Incredible drama
",2020-07-22 00:00:00,9,"Despite some minor plot holes The Rover is an incredible drama that's atmospheric, dark, emotional and intense whilst also creating a believable post apocolypse world without focusing too much on the backstory. Guy Pearce and Robert Pattinson both give perfect performances. David Mich√¥d's direction is amazing, it's extremely well paced and visually stunning. The music by Anthony Partos is excellent, both beautiful and haunting."
" Quite a Ride
",2020-07-21 00:00:00,8,"It's bleak, it's dystopian, it's realistic. Another view of what life would be like after the collapse and after the massive die-off that follows. I found it to be very interesting. Guy Pearce as the loner trying to get his car back (but why is it so important to him?) and Robert Pattinson as the slow witted, wounded brother of one of the carjackers forge an unlikely bond in this quest film. The plot isn't overly complicated, in fact it's a very simple ride. But in this film the ride is the journey. Just sit back and watch it unfold."
" A movie with no real substance or plot
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,4,"There is so little here in the way of a compelling plot. The ending made the already ridiculous main characters motive to do what he did almost more ridiculous. The actors all did well enough, but they were so simply written one note characters that it is not really saying much. You know that movie you randomly find and give a shot because it sounds interesting at a glance, and then it actually makes you angry that it wasted your time? That was this movie for me."
" Who's paying for good reviews?
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,1,"Because it's pretty clear that anyone rating this a 10, like so many have, are getting paid to push this steamer.
If you're going to watch this, you'll have to suspend all logic to be able to make it 5 minutes without shaking your head. And I'm ok with suspending belief to be able to get into a movie but the logical disconnects here are ridiculous."
" Are You Kidding? That's it?!
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,3,(Flash Review)The payoff to this film is equivalent to being thirsty and someone offering you powered milk. Film opens with a super vague story of a man in a bar in a dilapidated desert town ravaged by poverty and devoid any humanity as we know it. Three men steal his parked car and he obsessively tries to track it down. He comes across the brother of one of the guys that stole his car and they team up as the brother was left for dead. The man is also troubled by how rule of law is absent in this world. Cue commentary on what can happen without a enforcement of the law. Why is that man trying so desperately to find his car? It has a really interesting and unique soundtrack that matches the intriguing build and slow and contemplative pace. Too bad it didn't give enough story to contemplate and I felt the final pay off didn't deliver.
" Good film
",2020-06-02 00:00:00,6,"A very good performance by Guy Pearce, he show's very well a man who is suffering a lot and have nothing else to lose in a world that became a extremely dangerous place when basically anyone can't be trusted anymore, at least the part that was showed to us, but he still trying to survive because for the moment he still have one thing to do, also a very good make up work on him, that show's very well how a person would look living on those conditions.Robert Pattinson also gives a good performance of a man who is not necessarily a bad person, he has a limited mind and was more influenced to do bad things by the people's he used to live together, but in the end he don't actually wanna hurt anyone and fell guilty when he does, except when the movie need him to eliminates some peoples and save the main character, so that's kind of a negative point, but in the context of the movie this is not going to ruin the experience.The most negative point of the film are the persons who are the villains, but the real villain of the history is the world they are living, but again about the people's who are also the villains, they are not very strong during the film and until the very ending you don't understand why the main character is keep chasing them.I'm the end the most positive part of the movie is the ""friendship"" between Pearce and Pattinson characters, which is a good point, but not strong enough to maintain the film."
" Very twisted outback film
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,8,"Wife & I enjoyed this outback type movie as we do most outback movies.This is a down and out guy stalking the thieves that stole his car, I will not ruin the movie it is worth a watch if you like the Mel Gibson MadMax type scenery / environment.Worth a watch, I am not going into details."
" Beautifully bleak in the outback
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,8,"Set in a near-future post-apocalyptic Australia, The Rover follows Eric, a gruff anti-hero played by Guy Pierce (in fact, the role was written with Pierce in mind). When Eric's car is stolen by a trio of opportunists in trouble, he goes on a persistent rampage to get it back, picking up the injured and left behind brother of one of his targets (Rey, played by Robert Pattinson). The two unlikely companions slowly come to terms with each other and even bond as they hunt down the car and those in possession of it, leaving chaos and blood in their path.The Rover has been on my watchlist for a while, but I can't remember why I added it. Possibly because I love bleak post-apocalyptic films, or possibly because Robert Pattinson is becoming one of my favorite actors working today. Regardless, I wasn't disappointed in either sense. Pattinson plays a demanding role here of a young man with mental deficiencies, and he absolutely shines. (Similarly, he worked with this same director on a more recent film, Netflix-exclusive The King, where he played a surprisingly intimidating antagonist.) Of course, Pierce is also fantastic in his own role, and the two characters slowly make sense with one another as the movie progresses.The Rover is gritty, bleak, but also believable the entire way through. The locals look like real locals, violence is abrupt, graphic, and not obsessed over. Altercations come and go with little regard, innocents are slaughtered, teases of bonding with fellow survivors are ripped away to reveal the brutal reality of selfish survival. Someone's review mentioned Pierce's character is unlikable, but I disagree. In such a wasteland, I could easily see myself becoming like him to survive. Compassion will get you killed. In that sense, I never had trouble following Eric or his actions or reasoning the whole way through. The ending is as bleak as the rest of it, making this film one heckuva package that is just my cup of tea. The only thing that grated on me was the repetition of dialogue. Because characters constantly distrust others they meet on their journey, there are a lot of questions, dodging of answers, repeated questions, and more dodging. This started to get a little repetitive, but it's realistic considering the situations and our straight to-the-point protagonist who repeats questions with increasing force until he gets his answers.Overall, I really enjoyed The Rover. The performances are fantastic, the environment is gorgeous and bleak, and it's really a wonderful time to spend in a wasteland. Highly recommended."
" An effective bleak Dystopia film
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,8,"The Rover is basically what you get if a Mad Max story was told in a more realistic manner.The Rover is set ten years after an event known as The Collapse and turned the Australian Outback into a lawless landscape where society barely function. Within this world one man (Guy Pearce) goes on a mission of vengeance when his car is stolen by group of bank thieves.What David Mich√¥d created was a bleak neo-Western where violence dominates. I loved the world that was created in the first third of the film where human life was expendable, drugs dens exist, hiring boys for sex was possible and the army struggles to maintain control. It was great for people who like films like A Clockwork Orange and the first Mad Max film, films where society is collapsing from the bottom.The Rover does sag in the middle as it turns into a dystopian road trip, not helped by Robert Pattinson's thick Southern American accent. The story is light but it was compelling viewing, especially for people who like bleak films."
" depressing
",2020-02-15 00:00:00,3,"I saw the storyline and thought it would be good.I was wrong.The film is about 100 minutes long IMO 80 minutes too long.I kept it on in the background expecting something to happen but it never did.Thankfully I saw it on Amazon, if I had gone to a Cinema I would of walked out. Only advantage of watching this at the cinema is the person eating most of the time would of stopped you going to sleep."
" Trash
",2020-02-03 00:00:00,1,"This is an insult to trash. Pathetic, boring and a complete waste of time! Do yourself a favour and don't watch. It is a pound in CEX on blu ray for a reason!"
" Bored bored
",2020-01-31 00:00:00,3,Good cast boring nonsense plot. As stated eery aboriginal sounding score for no reason. Didn't like it.
" ""I'm looking for a car with three people in it.""
",2020-01-10 00:00:00,8,"This is a haunting but mesmerizing tale that takes place in the dystopian landscape of Australia ten years after the collapse of society. My timing in watching the film coincides with the out of control wildfires taking place in that country to make the experience seem even more surreal. It begins with an outcast loner who goes on a quest to retrieve his stolen car, and slowly and desperately turns into a mission of revenge with irretrievable results. Guy Pearce portrays the principal character with a singular focus, while developing an unlikely alliance with the younger brother of one of the thieves who stole his machine. For his part, Robert Pattinson affects a spooky and sinister countenance while seeming to be somewhat challenged mentally. Appearing almost catatonic at times, Rey arrives at the conclusion that his older brother left him for dead following a shootout that stranded him in the desert landscape. The two men form an unlikely bond that tends more toward the symbiotic than actual friendship. Violence and fractured loyalties accompany the pair as they locate the thugs who stole Eric's vehicle, with further tragedy yet to strike. The title of the picture doesn't really come into focus until the final scene, in which the name 'Rover' takes on a strangely double entendre connotation that might not be entirely self evident. The finale emphasizes the visceral need for Eric to get his car back, owing to his alienation from human contact when his personal apocalypse began."
" Slow burn but definitely burns well!
",2019-12-29 00:00:00,8,Very good slow burn thriller with really good performances! Very good performances and directing!
" Meh
",2019-12-04 00:00:00,4,Starts out great but goes NOWHERE real fast. I honestly don't get the rave reviews for Pattinson when all he did was play his character as half retarded and Guy Pearce only had one emotion through the entire film.
" Dark, Gritty, Violent, Slow Moving, But Very Good
",2019-11-12 00:00:00,7,"Dark, Gritty, Violent, Slow Moving, But Very Good Movie! Mad Max meets The Road. 7 Stars!"
" surprisingly effective !
",2019-11-12 00:00:00,8,"Great acting in this , and it is the thing that got me hooked the most , however the plot is unique and take place in a strange time .. it worked for me .. it really did , intense at times other times its really thrilling , and did i say how great the acting was ? .. for real Guy Pearce and Robert Pattinson both were such a joy to watch on screen , and they made you care about the characters they were playing which in turn made the final third of the movie much much better ."
" I feel sorry for those who dont get it.
",2019-10-19 00:00:00,10,"Way2grimee said in his review everything i wanted to say, go read his review"
" In a word
",2019-10-17 00:00:00,5,"BOORING..........................................
Everything is done quite well and was obviously put together by some skilled artisans. Unfortunately the plot way off anything I am likely to ever enjoy. It's drawn out very little dialogue so much the scriptwriter would have knocked it over in a few hours. I saw it through to the end out of my respect for Guy Pierce and my love of Aussie movies. Conclusion = Will never watch again!"
" A lot to admire, except for the story
",2019-09-21 00:00:00,6,"Very mixed bag, in my opinion.Performances: Excellent. Guy Pearce is riveting, tragic and incredibly nuanced. Robert Pattinson is fully convincing and immersed; you never feel like you are watching an actor.Directing: Also excellent. You can tell that you're witnessing a carefully crafted work from someone who is truly passionate and visionary. David Michod proves his vast talents.Story: Here is where there are problems. The realistic, desolate apocalyptic setting is intriguing, as is Guy Pearce's character. However, it never feels like much happens in the film. It's a slow burn, and the ending disappointed me slightly. I found myself wondering what the point of the entire thing was; a lot of screen time felt wasted.Overall, some very impressive things here, but a script that feels overlong. I would still recommend it, though."
" The plot is immaterial. Watch it.
",2019-09-12 00:00:00,6,"There's so, SO much of THE ROVER that I've seen before - almost all of it, really; there's not much in the Stoic Man Does A Violence, Grudgingly But Well genre left to film. The setting is bleak, the cinematography is bleak, the pace is bleak.The first break in that pattern is the surprisingly good score, which is full of great choices, and unexpected sounds.The second break is that Pearce and Pattinson, Pattinson especially, are incredible. I knew everything in this movie that was going to happen, minutes before it did, but Pearce's intensity, and Pattinson's transformation, kept me absolutely rapt. I cannot recall being more enthralled by a more predictable film - or more wanting other people to watch something so rote. They are that good.Pattinson does work here I never dreamed he was capable of, Pearce drummed the depths he flashes on occasion. Check this out."
" Outstanding
",2019-08-10 00:00:00,9,Fabulous Aussie film. With outstanding performances by Guy Pierce and Rob Pattinson.
" The Rover is a slow and poignant tale about a man who pursues the only thing left in his life
",2019-07-21 00:00:00,8,"Set in a bleak world where governance has collapsed and anarchy reigns, The Rover is a slow, intense and poignant tale about a man who pursues the only thing left in his life and the consequences of his actions to the people he encounters. Led by enthralling performances from Guy Pearce and Robert Pattinson the film delves into the motivations of the character in a world of lawlessness, albeit it fails to reach its potential. Portraying a bleak, barren wasteland and accompanied by good cinematography the setting pulls the viewers and make them feel the character moments. The score further enhances the emotional beats with the subdued melodies. The fault of the movie is its rather short length and its failure to completely delve into the characters and make their motivations wholly engrossing.-7.5/10"
" WTF did i just watched
",2019-07-21 00:00:00,1,"HORRIBLE MOVIE, to slow , nothing interesting about it"
" The way Dystopia should be done
",2019-06-24 00:00:00,10,"Really enjoyed this one. This is the style of Dystopian films from the 80s that I have grown to miss over the years. Direct brutality, raw and gritty.The lack of character development is actually an added bonus in this one for me. It leaves you to determine backstories, and motives. Which leaves the main character all the more enigmatic.Truly wished they would make more movies like these."
" Grim Masterpiece
",2019-05-10 00:00:00,10,"""The Rover"" (2014) with Guy Pearce and Robert Pattinson is a brutal and utterly superb movie set in the Australian Outback 5-20 years from now as the whole society teeters on the brink of collapse. It's never explained what went wrong but government services have evaporated and the Australian state is only maintaining a tenuous hold on the interior though military occupation. Violent crime is endemic, everybody is armed, and human life is virtually worthless.If this sounds like the set-up to ""Mad Max"" (ie the legendary, low-budget prequel to ""The Road Warrior""), I'm convinced that's no accident. The movie plays like the writer and directer were trying to create an origin story for the character of Max without the fantasy elements that reduced the original ""Road Warrior"" trilogy to the level of mass-entertainment shlock. The great Australian actor, Guy Pearce, plays 'Eric', the film's stand-in for Max. Eric is a tormented, damaged, and extremely dangerous man who may or may not have once been normal but is clearly nothing of the kind now. Your milage may vary but I found him and the movie unforgettable.Final notes: The script makes references to adultery, rape, pedophilia and prostitution but nothing explicit is ever shown on screen nor is there propaganda advocating for any of these things. The film is light on blood and splatter but there is lots of violence and it isn't prettified.I gave ""The Rover"" a rating of '10' on the IMDb scale and I virtually never rate anything that high."
" Simply awful
",2019-04-29 00:00:00,1,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is slooooooow, boring, virtually no plot. Three guys steal another guy's car and then the entire plot of the movie is for guy is for the first guy to go after them to get his car back. That's the entire plot. Oh and then there is the entire middle where they drag it out where they just travel throughout the entire movie to find the three dorks that stole his car. Then he gets his car back and that's the end. Boring, slow, dumb, and a total waste of time. A real stinker."
" A live transmission of a cheese's ripening process would be far more entertaining
",2019-04-02 00:00:00,2,"I'll keep it short. This is basically an endless series of extremely long and slow shots where flat characters just keep doing uninteresting things when they bother to do anything.
The acting is terrific, the sound is mesmerizing, the scenery is stunning, the photography is compelling. But the film is extremely tedious. Nothing happens here. There's no plot. The characters are non-existent. The dialogue is pointless gibberish. And no, it's not an art film, it's not avant-garde, it's just boring, poorly written and pretentiously directed."
" Dystopian Not Post-Apocalyptic.
",2019-03-29 00:00:00,8,"I was motivated to write this review in response to the ignorance, errors and confusion in the many negative reviews of this low-budget, independent Aussie DYSTOPIAN film. A caption tells us that The Rover is set in outback Australia ten years after The Collapse. Negative reviewers seem confused over this as The Collapse is not explained, but there are more than enough clues in the film (for those observant enough to actually pick up on them) that reveal the event was an economic collapse and obviously not the ""Collapse of Civilisation"" as many negative reviewers seem to believe. Apparently many people confuse dystopia with post apocalypse, even Quentin Tarantino judging by his quote on the DVD cover:""A mesmerising visionary achievement. The best post-apocalyptic movie since the original Mad Max.""Sorry Quentin but the original Mad Max film was not a post-apocalyptic film, it was a dystopian action adventure set in the near future. Society was in terminal decay, but law and order, government, and infrastructure still remained. The apocalypse in the Mad Max franchise took place between the first two films, this is clearly explained in the Road Warrior prologue.The Rover is not a post-apocalyptic film, it most definitely belongs in the dystopian future genre - There is still a centralised government, and some semblance of law and order maintained by military police. Obviously there is still limited infrastructure remaining, as we see freight trains guarded by heavily armed private military contractors. Gasoline, auto accessories, ammunition, weapons and food are still available to the public at highly inflated prices, but vendors will only accept American currency as apparently Australian currency is worthless. We find out that some form of mining industry still exists. None of these elements would be present in a post-apocalyptic world. Society is in a state of decay after the economic collapse, but it still exists. This is all quite obvious, the clues are all there in the film, and it seems many negative reviewers need every plot point explained in minute detail or they don't ""Get It."" - ""Why is the world like this?"" - ""Why is the main character so messed up?"" They would be better off watching the latest CGI overload Star Wars/Star Trek/Marvel trash-fest rather than this good dystopian future film. (Respect for the independent film industry, at least they're still putting out science fiction films for grown-ups, rather than the mega-budget epic pieces of crud continually churned out by Hollywood!)The Rover is also definitely not a balls to the wall action film, but a character driven drama, so there are no explosions or ""Hollywood"" action set-pieces. The violence in The Rover is quick, nasty, and brutal, and is portrayed quite realistically compared to most action films. Those who complain that nothing happens in this film were obviously expecting a traditional action film with all the standard clich√©s. There is no convoluted plot, this is a simple tale, slowly paced and this is not a film for those with limited attention spans. If dystopian future character drama is a genre of film you enjoy (such as: 1984. Gattaca. The Handmaid's Tale. Children of Men etc.), and you wish to view The Rover without preconceptions I would advise against reading the negative reviews as quite a few of them do give away the ending.The film opens with a shot of Guy Pearce's scruffy, burnt-out loner Eric sitting in his car outside a roadside cafe, a mournful, depressed, expression on his face. Eric exits the car, enters the cafe and is enjoying a drink of water when a gang of thieves crash their getaway vehicle after a robbery gone wrong. The vehicle is still drivable but wedged in coils of plastic tubing. The gang hotwire Eric's car and escape, whilst Eric finally manages to free the trapped pick-up and pursues the gang. He catches up with the gang and there is a confrontation, but Eric is rendered unconscious and the gang depart in Eric's car. At the climax Eric confronts the gang and finally recovers his stolen vehicle and we discover why he was so determined to do so. Negative reviewers scoff at this revelation, but it fits the character and the story, the tale of a man who has lost everything and trusts nobody, who will stop at nothing (including murder) to recover what was obviously the only thing left in his life that he still cared about.Negative reviewers state that nothing really happens in this film, and if you're expecting a wham bam action adventure with explosions and spectacular vehicular stunts every five minutes, watch Fury Road instead. Although the taciturn Eric has no qualms about shooting people in cold blood, and quite a few characters are gunned down in the course of the film. The Rover is a serious character drama not an action movie, as previously stated this is a simple tale about people surviving within the decaying society they inhabit. Guy Pearce's performance as the burnt out, nihilistic Eric, is understated and exactly what this film required. Robert Pattinson's performance as the mentally challenged Rey is also very good (his southern white trash accent is spot on), and the relationship that slowly develops between these two characters is the emotional core of the film and also parallels a relationship that relates to Eric's determination to recover his stolen vehicle.The direction and cinematography are very good and the supporting cast acquit themselves well. The excellent veteran Aussie character actor David Field (Two Hands, Chopper, These Final Hours) as gang member Archie, is in his few brief scenes, as always, very good. If character drama set in a decaying society is your thing, don't let the negative reviews put you off The Rover is well worth a look."
" Pattinson's talent is incredible!
",2019-03-22 00:00:00,5,The movie is not exactly full of emotion or action but Pattinson kept me watching. He has mad skills in this film. Definitely a strange/creepy flick.
" Good character study but...
",2019-02-16 00:00:00,5,"Moves very slowly with far too much walking and driving sequences which, i suppose, is supposed to give you time to think about their internal conditions but ...
Lots of repetitive and non-useful dialog: Who are these people? What's going on. Who are these people? Who are they? ..."" with no answer, nor any expectation that there will be.On the plus side, it's a slow moving Mad Max, and without the nonsense. The sweeping Australian landscape makes a great backdrop as it looks post apocalyptic already."
" Well... ... ... ...
",2019-01-28 00:00:00,3,"You know that feeling when you've watched 8 minutes of a movie and think to yourself, ""that's it... that's all i can take""?
I feel guilty about rating this mpvie not having watched it all... but i just couldn't!
So... there."
" Very compelling and realistic
",2019-01-17 00:00:00,10,"I just finished the film and afterwards was surprised by how moved I was.
I understood the actions of the characters and it felt real to me.
I could almost taste the grime of the landscape"

" Strong Acting
",2018-12-09 00:00:00,8,"The signature of a great performance is the sense that no one else could have played the part. Guy Pearce's Eric is such a role. He's the troubled soul of the film. Long before his motives are clear, we've registered the hurt, the loss and the futility that marks him out. The brooding tough guy's a part we've seen many times but Pearce sells his variant with conviction, in turn intimidating and heartbreaking."
" A BOY AND HIS DOG
",2018-09-05 00:00:00,6,"Eric (Guy Pearce) keeps to himself and minds his own business. Australia's economy has collapsed. The outback is lawless. Barter and US dollars are the accepted currency. When Eric's car is stolen by 3 other bad guys, Eric pursues them and doesn't let anyone stand in his way of getting back his vehicle, even though he has a vehicle.Eric teams up with Rey (Robert Pattinson) the ""half-wit"" brother of one of the bad guys. They become friends as we wonder what is in the car that would drive Eric with such passion. The problem with the film was when I found out, scratched my head and said, ""Seriously? Where did that come from?"" Could he of just... Wouldn't the bad guys have found it?A decent character drama that was ruined by a stupid ending.F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" Lauhgble post-apocalyptic setting
",2018-08-12 00:00:00,3,"This movie is pretty well-made, as in decent production, but that can't save its enormous flaw: a laughable plot. Somehow, in this post-apocalyptic world, shops are still open - even motels. People trade for US dollars. You'd think that the only thing of value would be actual goods: canned food, water, bullets, gas, medicine, and the like... but people only want paper dollars. Wow. I just can't overlook this ridiculous idea and it causes the entire movie to fall flat on its face.There are others, as well, almost equally bad. Cars still drive. I guess gas, air compressors, and spare parts are easy to come by when the world has collapsed? People live in the desert, out of all places, yet we never get an answer to how they actually get water and survive. Every place has electricity.These flaws are just mind-numbingly bad and cause an immediate disconnect from immersion. You just can't watch the movie without wondering ""wow, how could they possibly pretend the world would still be like that.""The main character is a total POS and you don't care if he lives or dies. Actually, I take that back: I hoped he'd die, because he's a scumbag.I do have to give a hat tip to the guy from Twilight, who did an amazing job playing a weird, nervous, unstable guy. Great job. Guy Pearce on the other hand was as one-dimensional as a piece of paper.Don't waste you time."
" The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078
",2018-08-10 00:00:00,7,"In the very near future, the government of Australia has completely collapsed. The cities are run by the military and the outback has turned into the wild west. A daring crime has just taking place, four men took out an army barracks, and only three returned, but while fleeing, they crashed their car, luckily, there is one by the side of the road. That car belongs to a man named Eric, and he really loves his car. Eric (Guy Pearce) jumps into the damaged car and chases after the men, only to lose them. He attempts to track them, when he's approached by a man claiming to be the fourth man left for dead, and Eric promises him, if he doesn't help him get his car back, the man will be dead for sure this time. The Rover certainly is a bizarre story and I honestly couldn't believe some of the place it went to, but in the end the story was really ingenious. Guy Pearce stars in his best role since Momento. I mean he really was the perfect choice for Eric and fit this role like a glove. Pearce is paired with Rob Pattinson who I couldn't stand until I saw this movie. My only experiences with Pattinson to this point had been a brief appearance in Harry Potter, and a couple of god awful Twilight movies. I honest thought he was just another one of these good looking guys, who couldn't act, but I was wrong. His character had so many dimensions to it, having to deal with a mental illness, while trying to understand conflicting emotions that he never had to deal with before. It was a tremendous performance. The film does have it's slow points and some of scenes are just sick and twisted, much better suited for a different genre, but all in all I really enjoyed this film. It was something different for a change in a unique setting. While it lacked any kind of background and the dialogue was almost nonexistent, one almost felt like you didn't really need it to understand or enjoy this film."
" Sloooow burner. Watch the first 20 minutes and the last twenty.
",2018-08-09 00:00:00,3,"Its a really drawn out saga/road trip deal. Kind of a Mad Max vibe, but really all your doing is sitting there and waiting for the big payoff at the end. And it really isn't much. It just kinda makes you say ""Ohhhh. So that's what that was all about."""
" Wow...Leave my car alone, eh
",2018-08-05 00:00:00,10,"This is an unexpected gem...Pattinson, the vampire guy, turns a great performance as far as i can tell...humdinger acting, sounds, music, terrain...Fargo, Coen Bros., Scorcese, U Turn and so many other good ones come to mind but, this one, is unique..."
" Abysmal
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,1,Perhaps the most stupid film ever made. Absolutely without any redeeming qualities.
" Worth Watching For The Acting
",2018-07-24 00:00:00,5,"I am on the fence on this one. First off, a stellar acting job by the two main actors. Guy Pearce is always a treat to watch in any role he plays, but the real surprise is Robert Pattinson, who does an outstanding job in his role (who knew?).The story itself is a let down, with not much happening (save for a few grisly murders). The dialog is sparse, which was probably intentional, and the actors have to work at keeping the viewer's interest. It's kind of like a big piece of cake with fancy icing that turns out to be fairly tasteless with lots of empty calories.Here's a hint for you, the title has less to do with the main character that it does with what's in his car's trunk.So I give the movie 5 stars; 2 for the storyline and 9 for the acting. It is worth your time, just to enjoy Guy and Robert's fine acting job."

" The living dead (review written on friday the 13th)
",2018-04-13 00:00:00,8,"The world economy has collapsed, only the most hardened people survive. That is the setting in which actor Guy Pearce plays an australian farmer whose car gets stolen by fugitive criminals. ""The Rover"" depicts the riveting pursuit to reclaim the stolen car.""The Rover"" is as bleak,dark and lost as I have ever seen it. But it can be worth it for those who are into this sort of movies portraying the bleak and gruesome suffering of poor people. No hope for anyone of a better future, only survival is what counts in this apocalyptic wasteland in ""The Rover"". Acting skills are beyond superb in this picture. Guy Pearce as well as Robert Pattinson play the roles of their lives. Almost unrecognizable, they both play intrigueging characters who are wasted and doomed. The soundtrack is as eery, rough and cold as the characters themselves. This movie drains out every inch of believe in humanity. The only thing the few remaining people in this wasteland do is trying to survive, by treating there fellow humans as threats, which can be shot dead in a second.Despite all this bleakness I still do recommend and appreciate this picture. Yes, the suffering is boring and pointless. Yes, the characters are depressed and mentally deranged. Yes, it is violent and heinous. And yes, I still do recommend it very much. Seen it 3 times now and it is here to stay. I must confess the first time I saw it, I just felt an aching hollow as if I had been gutted like a butchered deer. During the second and third time I watched it, this movie became more than just watching depressing violence and poverty. Therefore I think ""The Rover"" has great value and will be watched by me more often than the previously 3 times. Still I will only watch it when I am depressed. Not a joke, it is truly the only mindset with which I can stumach this much bleakness and cruelty as depicted in ""The Rover"". Still I will reward it with 8 stars."
" Its just a car man!
",2018-04-06 00:00:00,7,"The Rover.Dark, mysterious and sad.
Something the Aussies can do without exception.
Guy Pierce is superb as are all the cast and that wonderful Aussie outback as the never ending backdrop.
Stick with it as its what I believe is called a slow burner.
Why does he want the car so much, see if you can work it out. I did the next day!
Defenetly worth a look."
" Plenty of dust and grime, not enough heart
",2017-12-26 00:00:00,6,"The outback has never looked so desolate...which really says something. At first, the dust and grimness sucked me in; the movie was like an apocalyptic version of Of Mice and Men. But that story had far more heart than this one. And in the end, that is precisely what this film needed: heart."
" Strange bedfellows chasing cars
",2017-12-23 00:00:00,7,"Pearce, as the Protagonist, delivers a strong performance. I have come expect this from him. His character seethes and silently wrestles with rage throughout. Though there is no real scope to display range, his delivery is authentic, making the character believable. Pattison gives an engaging performance, this was unexpected. He did well not to overact and allow his character, Rey, to drift into caricature or start mugging. 
The movie has the spare, unforgiving Western nowhereness you'd associate with Cormac McCarthy's Border Trilogy -transposed to Australia. The Protagonist pursues the stolen car with the same desperate relentlessness Billy pursues his father's stolen horse in The Crossing. 
I watched this movie when it came out first and enjoyed it more perhaps on my recent second viewing. The reviews I have read are polarised; I can't relate to much of the criticism and I can't say the film is exceptional. It is entertaining with decent production values, great cinematography. The dialogue is sparse, the lack of tropes is refreshing. A strong lead performance and good support. Well worth watching."
" Homosexual Propaganda
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,1,"What started off as a potential retelling of Mad Max quickly turned into a propaganda film.I had to stop the movie at 20 minutes in, after seeing 3 different homosexual scenes, the last one being 'grandma' offering up her young grandsons for sex with the main lead, a man.Avoid this like the Bubonic Plague."
" Absolutely fantastic
",2017-08-08 00:00:00,10,"Oh boy!! I just finished seeing this, and I am blown away. This is a fantastic movie and I loved everything about it. I must admit I am surprised, that the total rating is at only 6,4 for the time being. The performances are incredible!! I expected a solid performance from Pearce (which he delivered) and happily surprised that also Pattison delivered a stunning and engaging performance. This movie comes highly recommended."
" Really a good movie!
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,8,A little slow in the very beginning but an intriguing story and relationship that is built with the two main characters really made for a Good movie! You will be surprised and interested.... Both Guy Pearce and Robert Pattinson were a pleasure to watch. A deviation from character portrayal for Pattinson and I was pleasantly surprised at his ability to make you believe his character and become almost endearing regardless of the odd part he plays.
