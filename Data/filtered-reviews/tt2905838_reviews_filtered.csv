" A Indian copy of knight and day movie
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,6,"I think when bollywood wants to make a movie, they look at Tom Cruise movies, then make it, every single scene is a copy of Hollywood, actually it's not too bad but creativity is better"

" Overly filmed action and imaginary story
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,2,Not so impressed by this. Only hritik's classy acting skills made me rate it 2 stars. Everything in this film was overly directed. Cinematography was magnificent. Thank you.
" Not my style
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,2,"I think that the special effects weren't as good as I expected and the slow motion was very repeated. Also I didn't get the story plot at the beginning and everything seemed strange.
For people who like action movies, I recommend this, but it's not my case."
" One of the best movie ever in bollywood.
",2019-12-17 00:00:00,10,I love this movie so much. The action and music is fantastic. The dance of hrithik roshan is world class.
" Copied from Hollywood film
",2019-10-22 00:00:00,5,"Rating4/10This time pass flick is an ok popcorn entertainer. Story is copied from Hollywood film. Has so so acting, loud songs and watchable stunts."
" Copy paste of knight and day
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,3,If you have already watched knight and day you will know not even the dialogue and location have not changed. The director claim he has taken 7 months to prepare the script but I guess a week would be sufficient to just copy the movie add up some irrelevant songs. Not a great movie to watch except for Hrithik Roshan...
" Dubbed version would have been better
",2019-08-13 00:00:00,2,Dubbing Knight and Day into Hindi would have been a better idea.
" Awesome move
",2019-04-12 00:00:00,10,Better than Hollywood. Best movie superb. Cant get better action dance
" Hrithik at his best
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,8,Don't listen to others. My rating is apt for this movie. Complete entertainment movie
" another Replica
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,2,"All i see poor attempt to replicate Knight and Day 2010 Movie ,
same dialogs, same actions , almost 70% similler to original .
except this one is a pure s****t !"
" :(
",2019-01-07 00:00:00,2,This is thriller like a MR. Bean in action. Why Hrithik decided to make this movie only with action and thrill. Movie's content is so rich but they acted like a comic film. The movie is not looking action thriller by all the sides.
" The Title Track is really good!
",2019-01-07 00:00:00,8,"8, for Hrithik Roshan's dance, body, beautiful eyes, and all the songs in the film. He is such a sexy man, I was totally fascinated by him."
" Goood attempt to make a action movie (remake),but action style was new for Bollywood
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,5,"It looks like casually written script,screen play is not up to the mark.
Going to the acting side katrina -below average,hritik-as per character good,little direction faults
BUT ACTION STYLE NEEDED TO BE APPRECIATED,BECAUSE THIS IS NEW TO THE BOLLYWOOD.
NEW WATERJET STUNTS.
ENTRY SCENE OF HRITIK WAS V.GOOD."
" Bade remake of night and day
",2018-11-06 00:00:00,4,Roshan acted well but as an audience you couldn't connect to the caractères
" Must to watch
",2018-09-10 00:00:00,10,If you haven't watched this film I suggest you to please watch it. It is perfect action packed film with suspense.The concept is really amazing. The film is somehow related to our Army and internal forces. The each actor played their role well in the movie.
" dear bollywood if u make movies for India dont sell them internationally...
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,1,"Hrithik Roshan go learn from SRK, though i don't think you will learn instead u will steal his moves, please thank God for your body appearance because that gives you women audience but men audience you have juniors and dumbs who don't watch too much movies.The version of movie I got was written that don't use any electronic device to record audio or images of the movie, yeah then i realized it was because the lazy directors and producers were terrified to be ashamed for their theft because the movie does not deserve the copyrights but deserve what I did, I deleted the movie before finishing it."
" Visually stunning with great action sequences.
",2018-06-28 00:00:00,6,"Vibrant, energetic and exciting! This visually stunning film was an absolute delight. I admit, the action sequences are purely for effect and in many instances humorous effect, as it simply can't happen the way it does. But it is thoroughly entertaining and the action sequences accompanied by thumping music is thrilling, to say the least! On an entertainment level, it scores ten out of ten! Hrithik Roshan is in top form and makes a credible action hero. There is an interesting twist and a fantastic climax action scene. I loved every minute of this two and a half hour movie! Wonderful, moving ending, as well."
" Bang Bang (2014)
",2018-01-05 00:00:00,1,The movie was worst. Nothing was good in the movie except stunt and fight sequences. Nobody acted good in the movie. The movie has no story. The movie was so boring.
" One of the decent action comedy film but it's still Good
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,6,"Superstar Hrithik Roshan made his fantastic debut in his father's directorial venture ""Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai (2000)"" which was a blockbuster at the box office. It was a big movie for Hrithik Roshan and Rakesh Roshan's career. After that, Hrithik giving a lot of flops and average films in his career. Hrithik's movies were flopped at the box office except one average film like Fiza (2000) includes Yaadein (2001), Aap Mujhe Acche Lagne Lage (2002), Na Tum Jaano Na Hum (2002), Mujhse Dosti Karoge (2002), Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon (2003), Lakshya (2004), Kites (2010), Guzaarish (2010) which was a critically acclaimed film but sadly it was a box office bomb except the hit like Mission Kashmir (2000), the blockbuster Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham (2001) Koi Mil Gaya (2003), Krrish (2006), Dhoom 2 (2006), Jodhaa Akbar (2006), Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011), Agneepath (2012) and Krrish 3 (2013), they all are a critical and commercial success in Hrithik's career. Now Hrithik is back with a bang in a action comedy thriller film Bang Bang! (2014) which also stars her ZNMD co-star Katrina Kaif in the lead roles. It is a remake of 2010 Hollywood movie Knight and Day starring Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. The film was a commercial success and was a hit at the box office. Bang Bang! is a stylish action movie with a lot of commercial elements with a dose of comedy, thriller, romance, adventure and drama. The story revolves around the colonel Viren Nanda goes to meet a wanted terrorist Omar Zafar in his holding cell. As Viren informs Zafar that he will be extradited back to India for his crimes, Zafar's men enter his holding cell, led by Hamid Gul killing all guards around them, with Zaffar then killing Viren by shooting him and then burning him. As Zaffar escapes in a helicopter waiting on the roof, he puts a $5 million reward for someone to steal the Koh-i-Noor diamond from the Tower of London, but with one condition – the thief must be Indian, to hold up a new extradition treaty between India and UK. Soon after, a international criminal named Rajveer Nanda steal it, and when Zaffar's men are informed of the theft, they travel to Rajveer for the deal. Although they initially travel with the $5 million reward, Rajveer informs them that he now wants $20 million for the deal. Following the disdain of the comment made by Rajveer, a fight breaks out between Rajveer and Zaffar's men after which Rajveer flies away. After Rajveer escapes, a CCTV footage of him is captured, showing that he is in Shimla. Following Rajveer's escape, he sees Harleen sitting in a restaurant, who is there waiting for her internet date, ""Vickie"", to show up. Will Rajveer be able to kill Hamid Gul or Omar Zafar? Is Rajveer taking revenge because of his brother gets killed? Is what follows the rest of the story, watch the movie to find out. The flaws of the movie I would say, the romance was little bit forced in my opinion. The love story was almost unnecessary, it should have been avoided that. The story could have been a bit better because it was bit draggy, it lacks the script and the connection of the audiences like the single screens and the multiplexes. The story should have been made a bit better. Hrithik Roshan is back in his action avatar which reminds you of Aryan in Dhoom 2. Hrithik excels with his character portrayal. As Rajveer who is ruthless, smart, intelligent, stylish and bad-ass criminal, he did a great job, he did justice to his role. Katrina Kaif as Harleen delivers her comic timing, her dialogues, her smile, her innocence, she is very good in her role. Danny Denzongpa and Jaffred Jaffrey repeats their villain act, they are wasted in the film. They are playing villainous characters before, but here, they are wasted, I mean, they wasn't so much powerful enough I would stay. There are 2-3 villains who chase Hrithik and Katrina in the film, and that's all, there is nothing else. They are wasted. Pawan Malhotra as a cop Zorawar performed very well. Hrithik and Katrina's chemistry looks lovely, convincing and believable. They looks sizzling and hot together. The romance was probably one of the best combination and chemistry I have seen so far. The rest of the actors provides decent support. The action sequences looks realistic which a bit similar to Hollywood movies nowadays. Even through its a remake of Knight and Day. The action was fantastic and it looks realistic. Thank God, there are not a cheesy stunts like crap action movies in the 80's and the 90's. And also there is not an one single over the top action where the actor got a punch and hits them and then people was flying anywhere. All the action stunts are fantastic. The direction by Siddharth Anand was fascinating, the cinematography by Sunil Patel are mind blowing and very well shot in the beautiful locations like Shimla, Abu Dhabi, Manali and Prague. The visuals looks fantastic and very well executed. The dialogues are good.The music by Vishal-Shekhar was great. Hrithik Roshan and Katrina Kaif's dance performance is a delight and visual treat to watch on the big screen. The songs Tu Meri, Bang Bang title track are catchy and party number which makes you dance on the floor. Meherbaan was a romantic song and it was very well shot in the city of Santorini in Greece. The background music by Salim-Sulaiman are sad but it was good. Overall, Bang Bang is decent movie strictly to watch only for Hrithik Roshan fans. I'm also a big fan of Hrithik but the movie was decent, it could have been better only for the story and editing. But the visuals of the film and Hrithik-Katrina's chemistry is a must watch and worth watching."
" Horrible.
