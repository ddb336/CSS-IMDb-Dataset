" Kinda Lane but alright
",2021-04-04 00:00:00,5,"The humor is kinda Lane, but its still somehow entertaining. The actors are also alright but tbh this movie has a deserved rating at 3.5."
" Underrated movie.
",2021-03-16 00:00:00,7,Laughed multiple times. If you both like the hangover and the hunger game movies u should definitely watch it.
" Awful just Awful
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,1,This will probably be the worst movie I have had the misfortune to watch but thankfully it only took me 30 minutes to gather my senses and switch it off.At no level was this funny or interesting and the actors must be biting their bottom lips by agreeing to take part in such an awful production.1/10 stars is generous and I find the high scores laughable and wondering if it might have been a better watch with my eyes closed.BIG miss if you can tempt your way to something remotely watchable.
" I've seen worse
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,3,"Going into any parody movie you really shouldn't expect anything. With the bar set low, it's a little less bad.I laughed a handful of times but definitely lost interest before the movie ended. A few good gags but they're lost in an underwhelming parody. If you're really bored and out of things to watch I guess it might be okay? Wouldn't watch it again."
" The Crossover of Movie Genres - Better Than I Expected
",2021-02-11 00:00:00,5,"The guy who plays Alan from The Hangover did a bang-on impression! I actually thought he was the original castmate. In fact, the guys that played the cast from The Hangover performed their roles very much like the original cast, which means they can act! Adding well known characters like Carrie and Catnip (Katniss from Hunger Games), gave viewers more reasons to keep watching. I thought their costumes and performance were also like the original actors and well done. Ted the bear was a nuisance as well as Tonto and weren't needed add-ins. The way spoofs flaunt raunchy sexual content, the 'lines' always seem to get blurred. Come up with something new Hollywood writers and directors!"
" Think of Scary Movie. It's a farce people
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,7,"Meant to make fun of itself, and it does the trick. Definitely not meant to be a hangover sequel, calm down people"
" Trash
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,1,"30 minutes in and I couldn't take it anymore. Some people will enjoy this movie, because it's comedy. But in my opinion the comedy was terrible. But if you are somewhat bored give it a go, good luck..."
" Delivers the goods
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,7,Self-aware trash that maxes out its R-rating. Almost wholesome in its debauchery.
" Happy new year.
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,1,"I hope this will be the worst thing I wasted twenty minutes on this year.
I rated 4421movies og series. This is my 12' ""one star""."
" Terrible, not funny, bad actors, stupid story!
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,1,Unbelievable that this can be found on Netflix! Absolute stupid movie! Not funny! Actors completely suck! Story is bad! So sorry I w√ºssten almost 45 minutes before I complete gave up! Zero star review is appropriate!
" A non-funny parody movie
",2020-11-18 00:00:00,2,"I can enjoy parody movies, even had a laugh or two at Movie 42 and Disaster Movie. This is not one of those. There is not even a 'slight chuckle'. Take a pass"
" Eh
",2020-10-05 00:00:00,3,Not a strong parody movie. Some of the jokes are just awful and it's a little sad to see some name/recognisable actors in this.Zach (Alan) was reasonably funny and I saw flashes of Ed (Stu) and Bradley (Phil) but there was barely enough in here to elicit a chuckle.Bonus points for Katnip's breasts.
" Couldn't Get Past One Glaring Issue
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,1,I couldn't get past they billed Bruce Jenner as Caitlyn Jenner when the film came out in 2014 and Bruce/Caitlyn came out the following year. Because of this one issue I couldn't even watch the rest of the film after Bruce's character arrived on screen.
" Tit-le
",2020-10-01 00:00:00,3,"Very funny I know - almost as funny as the movie ... maybe a bit funnier. Kidding aside and boy you will have to search hard to find kidding here, the best thing about this, is the title. I watched the unrated version, so no idea what the other version looks like, but I got the whole package, all the swear words, all the nudity and whatnot.Now this is combining Hangover and the Hunger Games, but it has many other characters from other movies. Be it Carrie, Ted, every other character portrayed by Johnny Depp and so much more. Now if that alone leaves you chuckling ... well you will have fun with it. Whatever the case and a Jamie Kennedy that is annoying multiple times (as in more than one character portrayed), if you watch it, endure the end credits and get a bonus scene that will either infuriate you or make you laugh out loud. It depends on your ... humor I would like to say, rather than anything else ..."
" Better than expected
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,10,"This movie is straight up awesome. Before you watch it, remember, this is a SPOOF movie. ALL spoof movies are supposed to be dumb. That is the fun part. You don't have to worry about plot holes, continuity, etc. Just take it at face value and have fun. That being said, this movie DID keep all the above together. Love how the main characters had the names of the real actors and looked like them to a degree (especially Zach G.). I laughed harder at this movie than any I have seen in a while."
" Makes You Chuckle
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,5,"This movie has a ""I'd buy it if it were in the Walmart dump bin"" buyability to it. It's a halfway decent satire, but certainly not on the level of Blazing Saddles or Space Balls. But then again, you couldn't do either of those movies in today's world which might be why we get such sad offerings.They did a fair job of lampooning Hunger Games. There were some decent laugh out loud moments, and the cast was likable. Except Curt Cobain guy that drank a lot. He was forgettable.I'd add this to my collection if I found it for 5 bucks. Or in a movie 4-Pack for 10 bucks. But that's the extent of my spending on this title."
" The hunger / hungover games
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,9,"I think this movie combined two movies into one, and it was better than the two movies it combined! Condensed and saved time, watch this instead of The Hunger games and the Hangover to save time! ;)"
" Lol
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,10,"This movie is everything good a must watch parody movie I love how they bring up how Doug is never in the posters it parody's movies like the hunger games, the hangover, Charlie and the chocolate factory, sex in the city, Carrie, ted and the avengers"
" A very pleasant film, I'd watch it again.
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,9,"That's a nice parody. I was particularly impressed by the resemblance, I cannot believe how some reviewers would complain about that. Like, if you hate spoof movies so much why bother and even review the thing.
Back to the movie, there were moments that I was actually taken in by the action (seriously, I wouldn't pause to check my phone), it looked pleasant and not at all cheap, apart from some of the supporting characters wigs.
The plot was pretty much coherent and there were some nice twists..and laughs! Raw, authenitically silly humor. Even when they weren't making a joke I kept being amused by the combination of characters, the romances and who beats up whom during the games. This for me was the best part, where the alternate realities meet. It is being offered on streaming services right now, so don't miss it!"
" Mediocre rip off
",2020-02-08 00:00:00,2,"This spoof relies heavily on other movies and shows for plot and content, there is no originality in this movie and while the acting is funny at times most of it is a rip off of The Hangover and the Hunger games, so much so that it lacks its own identity and seems more like a rip off and a waste of time than a solid movie experience.I wouldn't call this movie much of an experience, it was difficult to enjoy the story and the jokes."
" Butt-le Royale! Do you get it?!
",2020-01-25 00:00:00,6,"I do not think this deserves to be considered among the 100 worst movies ever.I'm the first to admit that these parody movies can be terrible. I actually love the idea of them, they're just lazily made.This is no masterpiece and a lot of the time I'm watching this and thinking ""I could have come up with a better line for that moment"", but it's better than a lot of the worst ones like Epic Movie or Meet the Spartans though it's not quite the quality of Date Movie or Scary Movie 5.It's sort of like the Parody movie's parody movie, the subgenre finally holding its hands up and finally laughing at its own shortcomings.We actually have a pretty cool and solid plot where the many factions of modern popular culture battle to the death and the whole develops in a fairly interesting, linear fashion with some fun gags (""this is a bad pillow"" had me laugh out loud) and we get a fairly satisfying conclusion even if it doesn't quite make sense.What did annoy me is how prudish they are about human sexuality. 17 is legal in the Majority of US states people! And this is after the ostensibly satirical ""gratuitous nudity"".It ticks the box for something fun and crass that you won't need to think too hard through."
" Why?
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,1,"Why did they make this?
Why did I watch it?
Don't be asking yourself these questions, do yourself a favour and give it a miss."
" STOP WITH PARODY MOVIES
",2020-01-17 00:00:00,1,"NOT EVEN 1 STAR WORTH AND ITS NOT FUNNY. SCENARIO IS GARBAGE, AND ACTORS DOENST LOOK LIKE THE HUNGER GAMES."
" An Epic Movie!
",2020-01-12 00:00:00,6,"I quite enjoy movies like Scary Movies, Eoic Movie and this ones added to the list, it's quite funny if you've got the humor."
" I feel numb.
",2019-12-03 00:00:00,3,Like...reference humor isn't funny. At all.The movie was bland and doing Inception as a middle finger at the end was dumb.
" About what you expect from this sort of 'comedy'....in other words, hardly a laugh in the entire film.
",2019-11-16 00:00:00,1,"There is only one reason I watched ""The Hungover Games""....it just appeared on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List today. This is a list of the 100 lowest rated major release films....and I am a major glutton for punishment, as I've seen 95 of the 100 movies on the list.It's not at all surprising that ""The Hungover Games"" is on the Bottom 100. After all, MANY similar brainless spoofs are on the list, such as ""Disaster Movie"", ""Epic Movie"", ""Date Movie"" and ""The Starving Games""--and they are more or less the same. This is NOT a compliment. Each tends to have a lot of very crude and juvenile humor and they are anything but subtle or intellectual...or entertaining. And, like these other films, the mashups simply make no sense...such as merging ""The Hangover"" with ""The Hunger Games"", ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Avatar"" and ""Snowpiercer"". The film abounds with sex toys, crude humor that falls flat and...well,...that's about it.The biggest problem with this film and other similar stupid parodies is that they are way too broad. First, they are very broadly written--with little subtlety and with an emphasis on crude instear of being funny. Second, they are too broad in their focus and would be MUCH better sticking with ONE film or one style of film instead of parodying EVERYTHING...which is often illogical and frequently mindless.So is this one any better than the rest of these Bottom 100 parodies? Well, there is a lot of gratuitous nudity. This isn't necessarily good....but at least it distracts from the 'humor'. In fact ANYTHING that tries to distract from the dopey jokes is a major plus. Heck, having Pauley Shore come out and juggle or read from the Yellow Pages would be a welcome distraction from the 'humor'! In fact, as I watched ""The Hungover Games"", I cannot recall laughing even once and it's no funnier than the other unfunny parodies on the Bottom 100. A worthless film in pretty much every way that was probably written by chipmunks...really, really DUMB chipmunks."
" BOOOOOORINGGGG
",2019-11-15 00:00:00,1,"Absloute rubbish i did not laugh at a single scence in the film, dull as dishwater turned it off half way through"
" Just STOP!!! Dear lord please!!
",2019-09-19 00:00:00,1,"It's simple, if your names are David Zucker, Jim Abrahams or Jerry Zucker, you shouldn't be making slapstick comedies. This is just another pathetic effort. Maybe you just need to be super high to muster a laugh. Avoid this crap, it's 1 hours whatever of your life you'll never get back. And lying on your death bed years from now wish for just 1 chance, 1 CHANCE !!! To go back to this day and wish you'd listened to me."
" Just about the average parody movie
",2019-07-23 00:00:00,5,"Honestly, it's not the worst movie ever seen, or even the worst of it's genre. Though it is still pretty bad.I was nodding off for a while, that is until I saw Sophie Dee (Kirsty Hill). Her inclusion (along with Kayden Cross's) helped get this it's five-star rating from me. 4 boobs = 4 stars.The other star was because there were a few times that I actually laughed at a few of the jokes and usually NEVER find anything to laugh at in these awful parody movies.I'd say give it a watch if you're truly bored (or are a person of culture who appreciates Sophie Dee, like me)."
" This movie sucked
",2019-07-10 00:00:00,1,This was the worst spoof movie I have ever seen I would not watch it ever agian
" This is a movie found from the garbage landfill.
",2019-07-08 00:00:00,1,This is movie that should have never been made to be released to the public because of how AWFUL it is.
" GAME SET MATCH
",2019-06-14 00:00:00,6,"Our Hangover spoof gang enter an alternative universe thanks to Zach (Herbert Russell). They find themselves as participants in the Hunger Games against various cult movie/TV characters including Carrie, Hunger Games, Thor, Johnny Depp characters, puppets, and gratuitous nudity.The humor and satire was second rate. I had a few times when I smiled. No laugh out loud moments. I enjoyed ""The Starving Games"" parody far more than this one which was missing its edge.Parental Guide: F-bomb, nudity (porn stars Sophie Dee, Kayden Kross, Ania Spiering, Rita Volk body double)"
" Eh, not as bad as those awful Seltzerberg films, but still kinda lame
",2019-03-20 00:00:00,4,"I saw this for free on IMDb's Freedrive and it was ""meh"". I did laugh at a few scenes, but that was it. While this film was still a letdown, I will say this; It wasn't insultingly unfunny like, say Epic Movie or Disaster Movie. There was a least some attempts at humor and they actually tried to make an actual parody film that wasn't full of irrelevant pop culture references that weren't funny (well, sorta), but compared to anything Setlzerberg has made, I give this an E for effort. It doesn't help that like Epic Movie, this film also features cameos from Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp version) and Captain Jack Sparrow and those were even still dated, back when Epic Movie was in theaters, back in early 2007. If want to watch this on Freedrive, I'd say go ahead, just don't expect anything like Airplane or Scary Movie."
" Finally a movie comparable to scary movie
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,8,Finally a movie with the same kind of humor as scarier movie... looking forward to a new chapter
" Look alikes
",2018-05-19 00:00:00,5,It's weird that the cast of the movie look a lot like the original cast of The Hangover. Uuuuggghh... why though?
