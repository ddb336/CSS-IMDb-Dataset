" This is Berk!
",2021-04-04 00:00:00,9,Heartfelt and a much darker film that sounds off on good momentum. This is one of those films that are better than the original.
" MY HEART!!!
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,9,"This movie takes EVERYTHING UP A NOTCH from the first. The action, the animation, and the raw emotion!!A very worthy predecessor to the first.
I think I was the only adult male in the theater and at one point my nephew, sister and a kid I'd never met before turned to me and said ""Are you crying?""YES I VERY MUCH WAS CRYING, OHHHH MY HEART!Bravo DreamWorks, you've outdone yourselves AGAIN. Between the HTTYD movies and the Kung Fu Panda movies they are really going after Pixar for the best animated films!!"
" Perfect, just like the first movie, but different
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,10,"In this film, we see a different theme from the first, as opposed to the first, this one shows a greater focus on action and adventure without going through the calm and smooth way, but it does not spoil, it brings its own recipe for tears. It also has an incredible villain, in addition to soundtrack and graphics even more perfect than the first film, all this forms this perfect formula that this movie is."
" How to Train Your Dragon 2
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,8,"The end of the competition was relatively good, but it was a bit compared to the pre-budget part ..."
" More Is Better
",2021-01-14 00:00:00,9,"The time gap between this movie and the last is five years, so when we see our favorite heroes again, there's a lot to catch up on. I'm very aware of the television show that takes place between the movies, and this film did a good job of making us feel like we didn't miss much. They elaborated on how the lives of the characters changed and how Burk adapted to this new age of dragon training.We also see a huge expansion of story, both in the world and with the characters. We see a whole backstory to Hiccup's mother and more story with his father. Through this we are introduced to how large the world is as Hiccup travels far from home. He finds his mother in a natural dragon sanctuary and there he learns a bit more dragon lore, like the concept of alphas. More breeds of dragons are introduced as well.Now that Hiccup & friends have become familiar with their dragons, they're able to do more, which resulted in a lot of action, as well as the opportunity to introduce a villain that causes a great climactic battle. With more action came more emotion as well. Going back to the mom, there were a few emotional scenes relating to her reunions. There was also a very impactful moment between Hiccup and Toothless when Hiccup was trying to snap his dragon out of the trance he was in, further enforcing the deep bond they share."
" Very good
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,8,"Although it does not have the same strength as its predecessor, which changed the direction of the studio, which before despite some fun features did not invest in good characters and stories with depth, this How to Train Your Dragon 2 is extremely happy in its approach. Not content with being just a remake of the original, it brings new characters (the introduction to Soluço's mother is particularly captivating) and addresses mature and intelligent themes while not forgetting the messages of love, and especially the tolerance they have made of first a real work of animation art. Rescuing everything that worked so well in the original and showing personality in the treatment of his characters (the change of tone in Hiccup was a bit abrupt, but I think it was necessary for the story to progress, neither could I be the indie nerd of the first film forever right people ...). The aesthetics and visual of the feature also speaks perfectly with the plot, adopting a somewhat somber but hospitable tone, and the mixture of middle ages (present in the characters' robes and armor), especially condensed with a plot packed by mythical references, is still especially fun. Nordic culture. It's all beautiful, captivating, engaging. How to Train Your Dragon 2 is everything a sequel should be. One of the rare sequels in recent animated franchises that lives up to the excellence of the original."
" Hiccup is a crippled Canadian
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,3,"The animation looks nice.Hiccup, after leading the revolution in his hometown, seeks to spread his ideology to the whole world. However, there is a guy without an arm who doesn't like that idea. Also Hiccup's mom is alive?!?! That's crazy. There's a big fight between to big dragons, they were totally ripping off Pacific Rim and there was not even any blood. The situation looks dire for the revolutionaries. But with the power of camaraderie the bad guy is taken down (he gets iced). Also Hiccup's dad gets killed and it was sad ;'(. I found it hard to watch this movie because nothing happened. Also what was up with the music?Vive le revolution!"
" Spectacular
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,9,It was a pleasure to watch this movie. My daughter and son throughly enjoyed watching it. I might have enjoyed the movie more than they did.
" A Guilty Pleasure
",2020-12-25 00:00:00,6,"It is a okay film, but not the best. To be fair, when I heard that they're doing a sequel, I was so excited. I wanted to see it in the theaters, but never got a chance. I remember liking for the first time, but as the years past, it became a bit of a guilty pleasure, and I knew something's off about the movie. There are some scenes that I like, but there are some scenes I don't like. And some scenes makes my toes, and spinal cord cringe. Overall, it's not my favorite of the 3 films."
" Amazing
",2020-11-26 00:00:00,9,"The next adventure of Hiccup and Toothless was great and on par with the original. With epic battles and very emotional and interesting writing with some loveable characters return, it stands as not only a solid feature, but also one of DreamWorks best films. It is true that it might suffer from a few weak points like some one dimensional comic reliefs, a weak and lazy start and a villain that can sometimes go a little too cartoony (even though Drago is still a good villain), but all of those are not enough to take it down with beautiful animation, some characters (especially Hiccup) being improved from before, and a lot of heart."
" Darker, but not as good
",2020-10-18 00:00:00,7,"Not as good as the first, still a good movie but really, really what on earth is going on with Cate Blanchetts accent?! Embarrassingly bad, not American, not English and certainly not Scottish. I suppose there's no Scottish female actors huh?!"
" Excellent
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,10,Our families favorite of the three movies. BoyMom approved! A bit of a tear jerker in parts...be prepared to shed a few tears.
" The best movie in the entire trilogy!
",2020-08-25 00:00:00,10,"In my opinion this is the best movie in the entire trilogy because it has everything bad villains, death, reunion and if course hiccup and toothless I think this movie really shines when you look at the flying scenes where hiccup and toothless are flying through the air like he is on a cloud. It really makes you feel like you in the clouds with them gliding through the air. Trying to review this movie without spoiling it is really hard but just take it from me if you like HTTYD 1 you are going to love this movie even more and if you haven't watched HTTYD 1 go watch it before you watch this one."
" A nice franchise
",2020-08-10 00:00:00,10,"I am enjoying watching these films. Are educational, clever, cute and fun. We have to protect our animals even if they are ugly haha. My daughter said that. If you are a big family this is your movie."
" Raises the stakes
",2020-08-05 00:00:00,7,"This film really raises the stakes. We are no longer restricted to the tiny village of the first film, instead we are introduced to a dizzying world with much bigger and intense dragons. The action and animation are greatly improved in this film though the story seems a bit too typical."
" great plot; well-developed villain; great plot; great finale
",2020-07-10 00:00:00,9,"100% spoiler-free.91% on RT.
7.8 on IMDB.
76 on Metacritic.

$145M budget; $621.5M box officeThis movie was excellent.The villain looked like a true villain and had some good characters development, and his army was huge. The plot made sense. The story had an unfortunate event, but such a thing was probably needed for the finale to be possible.The finale was great.Conclusion: this sequel was great and although the ending was bittersweet, it somehow managed to top the prequel's ending.9/10"
" A completely family entertainer!
",2020-06-25 00:00:00,10,"Well, my actual rating rating would be 9/10. But the average rating didn't seem to do justice, so it's a 10.The 'How to Train Your Dragon' movie series feels like watching a Disney animated entertainer like Zootopia or Moana or Frozen. Movies that refreshes the hope, love and positivity held within. A man of any age can watch this as long as they have a child in their heart, beneath their flesh. DreamWorks has impressed me this time also. They have made also other great movies I have watched, innocence shown in a beautiful way. They bring positive relaxation in the mind. Hiccup always found what he had within his heart, at the end at least."
" How to Train Your Dragon 2
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,6,"Climax lasted way too long, and the story felt a little too much of a bland repeat of the last film. Hiccup's mom was great, though."
" NICE.
",2020-05-30 00:00:00,8,"This film manages to not only provide an amazing story, but also accomplishes to fix the issues the first one had. Perhaps, the best thing in this movie is the loss hiccup goes through thus developing as a character so much."
" 10.28
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,10,What are you doing Dreamworks! Making the second movie in a trilogy perfect is extremely hard and only a few have a done it. HTTYD 2 is defiantly in that category. The plot doesn't feel rushed or slow. Some shots are absolutely magnificent and feel reel even tho it is animation. John Powell even improved his scores but they are a bit in the background most of the time. Total: 10.28
" interesting
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,8,I like nightmare it is very cute people and others beings canbe friends peace and love are very imporant
" My personal favourite of the trilogy
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,10,"HTTYD2
First I'm going to try to think of a problem... I mean the villain could have been better? Anyway, I think this movie is close to perfect. The animation is beautiful. It almost feels real because it's so incredibly detailed. The music is also beautiful, it's one of my favourite scores ever. The characters are also great. We've come to really care for them by now. I mean I'm mostly ambivalent to the side characters, but the characters that are important are all so good. The story is also very compelling and is an interesting continuation of the first. It expands the lore and world of this universe without feeling unnatural. And yah the villain wasn't great but he served his purpose well, and he got better as it went along. The movie also has some funny moments but what's impressive is that they are incredibly well balanced with with the more serious and dramatic moments. And speaking of dramatic moments... Stoick's death was the closest I have ever come to crying at a fictional work. Like I remember when I watched this back when it came out I had no reaction to him being shot by Toothless because I didn't think it was possible that they would actually kill of a character. (I was only 10 at the time). I thought he was going to wake up any second. Only when the funeral boat scene came did I realize. And I didn't cry but I could feel I was getting close. That's just such a beautiful moment and I really makes the movie for me. So yah this is one of my favourite movies ever and it gets a 96%"
" The Most Epic Animated Movie Ever!
",2020-05-12 00:00:00,10,"Literally last 40 mins is Epic As hell its the most amazing animated war!Music was literally phenomenal everything story,screenplay visuals specially animation it was pure Masterpiece."
" How to train your dragon 2
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,8,"How to Train Your Dragon 2 follows the common rule of sequels by making everything bigger, even though that isn't always enough to justify the series. In fact, it usually leads the franchise into a disaster, and thankfully this film is one of the rare which lives up to its promise. While it already provides the most breathtaking action and impressive visuals, it also able to expand the universe and give huge room for nice warmth beneath the bombast. Once again, the studio has put aside their recent style of broader gags and bullet speed pacing and settle down for a real storytelling that reminds us why animated movies are so appealing anyway. How to Train Your Dragon 2 has given all what you've wished for as a great sequel.The plot sure does heightened into an epic installment, it could have been an easy throw away of cool effects, battle sequences, and humor, but the movie is smart to keep on following its own roots by settling more on the characterization of their world and Hiccup's life with his dragon and the tribe. To keep it from being a wheel spinning visual showcase, the story embeds itself with full of inspired emotions, example is when it explores the icy dragon cave. It wasn't only an exposition, it is mainly a developing relationship between Hiccup and his long-lost mother. The quieter moments of letting the once disconnected family reunite again captures the same heart of the boy and dragon friendship of the first movie, which certainly made it pretty endearing.The film also spends its time exploring more places around and beyond the Isle of Berk. It's quite interesting to let the years pass by and make the young vikings grow mature, and how it depicts their maturity is pretty clever, like the hormonal attraction of Snotlout and Fishlegs to Ruffnut, in spite of fact their comic relief get a a bit way out of hand. The dragon species were also given enough intriguing details, essentially for the plot, which sort of recalls the book series of Cressida Cowell. This is a rich universe that makes the whole journey even bigger.The voice acting is predictably great. Jay Baruchel still brings the same earnestness to Hiccup even when the character's new appearance has outgrown his voice. Gerard Butler remains to be perfect as Stoick The Vast, he lends more gravity to the character in this one. Cate Blanchett joins in and she appropriately gives a great amount of warmth to the role. The other cast did well enough at keeping things much alive. For the filmmaking, the direction handles a better pacing compared to the other quicker cuts of the last few animated films. It's an easier way to watch by concentrating each scene of getting know of the characters, either with or without any dialogue. The flying scenes have always been a tremendous ride with scale and fortitude. John Powell's score helps making it feel much powerful, and it gets even better with a Jónsi song in it.Apart from Disney, these are the only animated films of Hollywood today that have a wider ambition other than selling off kids with cool visuals and absurdist humor. There is an actual story to be found here, even without following its source material. The typical elements of Dreamworks are still there, but is hardly noticed. It's nearly like the first film, except of course it's larger. It does justice to today's family fare, somewhat forgetting the current mediocrity and rather fills it with inspiration from the past. One thing that is missing in most of the genre's attempt of transcending their films is the sincerity to its heart. Every affection in How To Train Your Dragon 2 never felt forced and right there it soars way up high. And if we have learned something about training dragons from the past, then it is the same thing about sequels: You don't just yell at it."
" Wonderful movie
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,10,"Truly a great story of friendship, loyalty, bravery and goodness."
" not as good
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,6,"I absolutely love the first part of the series, I don't know how many times I've watched it and I cry every single time. After years now I bought the second part and watched it and hmmm... emotionally nothing happened. The only thing still super touching is Toothless, who is quite in the backround in this movie. But for the rest, well, it just get's too unreal. It of course had a touch of unreal when in the first part Hiccup's father understood his son in the end, said sorry and changed his behaviour. (in real life that is something that probably doesn't happen ever, but we all wish it did)
But in the second part now, they just overdid it for me. Hiccup meeting his lost for twenty years mother, who is of course the wise dragon lady. Both are not awkward but HIccup just makes flapsy jokes and the mother is all wise and in no time they smile at each other and everything is fine. Next, HIccup's dad finds out his wife is still alive. And after these two people parted in anger twenty years ago, they just kiss and then dance and again - everything is fine?And apart from that I couldn't help myself but getting annoyed of Hiccup with his behaviour. His father tells him, and rightly so, that there indeed are people who are evil and won't change their views and ways. He underlines this with telling him a story, that Mr. Bloodfist caused a whole hall of vikings to die in fire, and Hiccup still doesn't care and goes onto this mission to just talk the evil master out of his evilness? In in doing so, he endangers his loved ones, Toothless several times and with his behaviour, he actually causes the death of his own father, who tried to warn him. What is the message of this movie supposed to be? Just talk to psychopathic terrorists like Bloodfist and they will understand and from then on be nice people? Sorry, but that was just too much, and instead of touching me that movie annoyed me mostly.Also the actually wonderful soundtrack themes of the first part go totally under in the second movie due to too much action sequences for the sake of it.I understand that they want to have a positive message in these movies, and in the first part they did it so perfectly. But in the second part they just overdid it and made the shown emotions between people seem totally unreal and kind of forced.
I still have to watch the third part and really hope they get back on track with it."
" Perfect sequel
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,10,"Dreamworks has done the impossible! They've officially beaten Pixar as the best computer animation studio. Sure they've had some duds, but so has Pixar. (I'm referring to Brave) This is one of the best, if not the best, of all the films they've put out. Don't expect this to wrap everything up though, because just like Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, this isn't a sequel, but rather act 2 of a 3 act story that you have to watch in order. Fans of the book series may be dissapointed to learn however, that just like the first film, its completely different from the books. This is also not the same formula that Dreamworks has used for ""Shrek"" and ""Madagascar."" Unlike those films this has a darker, more serious tone and is definitely anything but cookie cutter. I'm optimistic that ""Dragons 3"" will not be Dreamworks milking a dead cow, but rather making a fresh cut of prime rib out of it.
Grade: A+ 10/10 5/5 stars"
" One of the greatest sequels of all time
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,10,How to train your dragon 2 is a masterpiece in animation history if you want to talk about the amazing relationship between hiccup and astrid and the best friendship all time hiccup and toothless this probably my favorite soundtrack in the how to train your dragon trilogy and I love how dark this movie gets. Also great battle sequences and great villain there so much to love about how to train your dragon 2 just watch it do your self favor and do it
" Just like the first, this is a happy and average animated film
",2020-01-20 00:00:00,6,"The world of HTTYD is fun and has obvious analogies to our world, whether towards animals or towards other societies or natives, but the plots are standard fare. The bond between Hiccup and Toothless is a heartwarming one, and seeing Toothless come back to him despite the Alpha's control was a great scene. The plot is cut and dried, with an obvious redemption arc, a token sacrifice (which was still well played in the moment), and Hiccup being the obvious hero while everyone else stands around watching. Exactly how the Alpha via Drogo controls other dragons, and how he was taken down at the end, were pretty vague, as was Drogo's specific reasoning to put together an army and take control now when it seems like all he needs is the Alpha control to get everyone. Astrid was more or less ignored by the film. I honestly didn't find it convincing from a coming of age perspective - Hiccup doesn't learn about himself, he just saves the day with Toothless. It's still an interesting world and the plot mostly works, and you still end up rooting for Hiccup and Toothless. Mediocre, but not quite a disappointment."
" A strong and hard hitting sequel that we will remember for the rest of our lives
",2019-12-17 00:00:00,9,"Dreamworks once again knocks it out of the park with a sequel that's emotionally resonant, visually dazzling and a hefty story to tell. The how to train your dragon seiries is unique in the Dreamworks franchise since it deviates from Dreamworks traditional formula of slams at Disney tropes and pop culture refrences along with off colour humor. The writing and character development is still as strong as it's ever been with Dreamworks constantly upping their game in the animation department with every movie that comes out. The visuals are sharp and detailed with sharp stylish direction aswell as an emotional score. The editing and pacing of HTTYD2 is also on point with a constantly entertaining and flowing story with some incredible sequences of action.The characters are now older and a bit more mature with Hiccup reaching adulthood with his bond with Toothless becoming now unbreakable as they fly with such style and grace. The flight sequences are just as amazing as they were in the first movie with some incredible animation with some real talent behind it's style and designThe villan is also scary and intimidating which is great to see, most Dreamworks villans in the past have been good but the one in this movie is actually ruthless and monsterous to a point where it will scare kids and feels like a threat.The lore of the world of dragons deepens as more is discovered about the source of the dragons and the home they live in aswell as more being learned about Hiccup's familyThe movie is an incredible achievement from DreamWorks that continues the story of dragons into darker territory with once again the imagination and talent behind the animation team at DreamWorks shining through once again pushing the bar higher on what can be done with animation"
" A+
",2019-11-24 00:00:00,10,"By far, in my opinion, the best sequel to a animation movie ever. Every category had been multiplied towards greatness than the last movie. The Villain was much stronger, the relationship was supreme between Toothless and Hiccup. Astrid and Hiccup had good chemistry. Truly nothing was wrong with this movie. I couldn't think one thing wrong with it.
I laughed, cried and smile and felt joy throughout the whole movie and all that I could say in order to justify this movie is by saying everyone should go watch this movie.Its made for every age."
" Great Movie
",2019-10-28 00:00:00,10,"A must watch and great adventure!
The movie is so amazing."
" A MUST WATCH (in 3D) !!
",2019-10-27 00:00:00,9,A rare sequel that succeeds in elevating a series to the NEXT level. One of the BEST 3D animations ever which delivers scintillating & immersive visuals..SIMPLY SUPERB WHOLESOME ENTERTAINMENT for the whole family !A MUST WATCH (in 3D) !!
" A great follow-up that feels natural
",2019-10-20 00:00:00,10,"How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a worthy follow up that's easily on par with the first, if not even better. It boasts the requisite stellar visuals and talented returning voice cast, that alone gives it six stars. The way the story progresses in such a natural, satisfying way that doesn't feel forced yields two more. (So far we're at eight.) The emotional beats work on so many levels. Whether it's watching Valka reunite with Hiccup and later Stoick or the sacrifice and funeral of the latter, you're made of stone if you don't tear up even just a little bit. Just saying. I give it one more for that. (Now we're at nine stars.) And now for the most important ingredient that yields the tenth and final star. (Insert drum-roll here.) TOOTHLESS IS SO ADORABLE! HE'S JUST SO CUTE! Okay, in all seriousness, while Toothless is easily responsible for some of the first six stars, the tenth star has gotta be given for John Powell's amazing score. Every track makes each scene feel exciting, (Dragon Racing, Battle of the Bewilderbeast) wondrous, (Together We Map The World, Flying With Mother) dark, (Meet Drago, Alpha Comes To Berk) emotional, (Stoick's Ship) and even satisfying. (Two New Alphas.) All this comes together to create an excellent experience that's worth re-visiting."
" Glad to have you back, bud
",2019-10-08 00:00:00,9,"It's been a while since the first movie, and its sequel couldn't be any more pleasing. More often than not, the word ""sequel"" scares people, me included. But there's nothing to fear here, folks. This is a solid movie. The animation is better, there's more things going on in the story, more characters that are pretty likable, the music is literally epic, and it's funnier. Highly recommended.9.4/10 (Amazing)"
" If happiness had wings
",2019-09-30 00:00:00,8,"Despite being a twenty year old living in the generation of movie lovers of Twilight and Transformers, How to Train Your Dragon tingles my senses every time I watch it. The bond that Hiccup and Toothless have is nothing short of a rare sight during a rapidly declining Hollywood era. From the marvelous skill John Powell shows to compose the score for this masterpiece, to the animation, to the simplicity yet purity of the plot, this franchise continues to inspire me, and many more."
" Idk
",2019-09-12 00:00:00,4,I don't know just not my type and hate it cuz it didn't need a sequel like that
" How to Train your dragon 2 is better then the first movie.
",2019-09-02 00:00:00,8,This is a great movie. This is better then How to train your dragon 1. It has a great story line. It also has great acting. It is a fun movie. See it. It is the best movie ever.

",2019-07-20 00:00:00,7,7/10 - enjoyable animated feature that doesn't suffer from a sophomore slump
" How to train your dragon 2
",2019-07-10 00:00:00,9,"I picked up my future wife for a simple dinner and a movie date. We hadn't picked out a movie yet as we had decided to choose at the theater. Upon arriving, we saw that How To Train Your Dragon 2 was selling it's 8:00-10:00 Thursday night showings. I'd completely forgotten it was coming out Friday, so both of us, ecstatic, decided on that movie.I went in expecting a great film.I came out blown away.I can honestly say I've never seen a sequel better than it's predecessor, but How To Train Your Dragon 2 does nothing but improve and top the first one.The music was the best I've heard in a very long time. The story introduced so many things that was simply another piece of master storytelling. The relationships in the movie, especially Toothless' and Hiccup's, were written to their absolute strongest.After all the films I've seen, all the shows I've watched, all the books I've read, I have never come across a friendship stronger than Hiccup's and Toothless'. The way they write that relationship is just . . . it's never been done before.The story itself is actually pretty simple and actually a really short story, but it's a story you could tell the writer fell in love with. And he brought this story to the best it can absolutely be. The villain was chilling, the characters' outcomes were emotional, and the climax will completely shake your soul.I have no complaints. No complaints at all. There is nothing I would change about that film. Not a single thing.I just really hope they saved the best for last, because I don't know how they're going to top it."
" Excellent sequel
",2019-06-24 00:00:00,10,"How to Train Your Dragon 2 is amazing!
The animation is superb - much better than the first one. The acting is amazing, as usual, and everyone does a good job and bringing you into the characters and making you care about them.
Very emotional and some surprising twists and turns.
Awesome villain. Perfectly cast, as well, I might add.
Breathtakingly perfect at some parts and very sweet. Brought tears to my eyes at some points.
Definitely recommended."
" A wonderful sequel
",2019-06-21 00:00:00,9,"Just as beautiful as the first movie! The characters are still the people we love, and the plot is thick with excitement and fun. The graphics are incredible, and the voice acting is convincing and heart-felt. I recommend it to anyone who loved the first movie!"
" Fantastic Family Fun
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,9,"Well this is a fantastic family movie. I never expected it to be as good as the first but it might even be better. Firstly the animation is superb, it was fascinating to watch and you seen subtle signs of how the characters have aged. What I loved about the first is how its story is told, there is a wonderful continuation here with some new ideas which fit in perfectly without feeling forced. There is a typical good vs evil base plot to entertain the little ones whilst theres more emotional moments to really make this movie stand out and live strong in your memory. As a sequel its more mature, yet still cute and funny with enough imagination and fun for everyone to really enjoy."
" Decent
",2019-06-02 00:00:00,7,"Nice sequel, story aged with the characters well. Good villain too."
" A Very Solid Sequel
",2019-05-20 00:00:00,8,"This movie isn't as good as the original ""How to Train Your Dragon"", but you know what? It is far better than 75% of the other sequels I've seen. While this movie doesn't boast the same amount of fun and excitement as the first one, what it does have is expansive world building, great character development, some pretty cool action sequences, and a surprisingly emotional climax. No, it's not as good as the original, but it is an incredibly worthy sequel, and that right there is enough for me to sing praises for it.
I think the thing that I like most about this movie is that it is incredibly different than the original, while it still manages to maintains much of the magic that made the first movie so great. As the first movie ended with dragons being accepted into Berk, this movie starts when dragons have more or less been worked into every day life. The village of Berk feels new, while many of the things there are still the same. Similarly, Hiccup has changed; he's older, more mature. He's no longer dealing with feelings of isolation, now he's wrestling with a question of responsibility; he doesn't feel he's ready to become chief, despite what his father says. I really like this growth of the location as well as our protagonists. It feels as if the world has actually evolved, as if the events of the first film had forever changed Berk and the world around it, and that kind of gravity given to consequence makes all of the events in this film feel more important."
" Much to live up to
",2019-05-10 00:00:00,9,"The second of the trilogy had a lot to live up to. Where the first was on a simple scale, though creative, colourful and musically superb, as it told the origin of Hiccup and Toothless's bond, this one is busier: loaded with new A-list voice talent, expanding the dragon culture and is even more colourful. But, what it added in scope, it lost in simplicity and intimacy of storytelling. Also (and not necessarily a bad thing) there seemed to be a shift in the character artwork and it felt akin to TROLLHUNTERS, which was also a DreamWorks production. Still a really good movie but, in my opinion, not quite as good as the original. I give this film a 9 (superb) out of 10. {Animated Family Adventure}"
" Better than the original.
",2019-04-17 00:00:00,9,It's almost perfect the only problem is that the villain doesn't come in till later in the film.
" An improvement in, essentially, every area, except from the narrative.
",2019-02-28 00:00:00,6,"'How To Train Your Dragon 2 (2014)' is technically an improvement on the first in pretty much every area, expect from the narrative. The story itself is actually quite messy, stalling in its middle section before rocketing into an unearned and kind of rushed finale. What it does better than its predecessor, however, is character. I mean, it's nothing groundbreaking but it's better. The core players aren't as flat this time, especially the father figure; he actually feels like a 'real person', as opposed to a caricature, and his actions are far more three-dimensional. There are far more scenes that rely solely on the interaction between characters, without really pushing forward the plot. Because of this, the pace seems slightly slack. There also isn't the sense of thematic integrity that the first so strongly had, which is a shame because it results in a film that doesn't really feel as though it's about anything. The violence is also bizarrely tame, especially since the feature tries to push a somewhat darker tone on the whole. The flick cuts away, essentially, every time something even remotely approaching 'bloodshed' is about to happen, which is very noticeable and reduces the impact of more than one key moment. Other than that, the action is pretty satisfying. It's high-flying and fast-paced, brought to life by animation that is, in general, much improved. The rendering, in particular, has taken a large leap forward, though there still seems to be a little something missing from behind the characters' eyes. Overall, the experience is enjoyable and, usually, comparable to that of the first flick. It isn't as tight from a narrative perspective, though, and this actually limits its emotional impact. It's certainly not a bad effort, but there are better movies out there. 6/10"
" Tears and laughter abound!
",2019-02-28 00:00:00,10,"One of the best animated movies ever!
Best animated visual effects and crisp visuals I've ever seen and oh the feelings.... If you have a heart or have ever been in love, your movie will tear at your heart strings - hard.
But there is also plenty of drama, action and comedy in the mix!If you loved the first one and the TV shows this one goes above and beyond. You won't regret it!"
" Beautiful animation and visually exciting with a side of a heartfelt story.
",2019-02-27 00:00:00,8,"How to Train Your Dragon 2 (4 out of 5 stars).How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a fun filled animated action fantasy film with an emotional inspiring story, beautiful animation, and visually exciting action. The film does have another inspiring story to tell while packing an emotional punch with the characters. Hiccup (jay Baruchel) has caused a change in his Viking tribe. Now, they are riding dragons once they learned to train them. They have a sporting event with riders and their dragons using sheep as a ball to toss in a basket. Stoick (Gerard Butler) has wanted to train Hiccup to follow his footsteps in being a leader for their tribe someday. Hiccup is prematurely not wanting to take that responsibility yet. Hiccup is flying to new territory. He discovers another tribe that was demolished by some unknown new dragon which Eret (Kit Harrington) blames any dragon riders to be responsible. Hiccup soon discovers his mother Valka (Cate Blanchett). Who is living in an area filled with dragons. Which she is trying to protect them against a warlord Drago (Djimon Hounsou). Who wants to raise a dragon army for his own power.There are new fun characters that you meet. And also a menacing villain Drago. And the dragon he raises which is known as the Alpha is a gigantic monstrous beast that looks kind of scary. The animation in the film is beautifully done. The landscapes, the action sequences are fantastic. I did feel like the movie did have a slower paced plot than the original movie. But it does not the stop film from being good.Overall, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a good film. The visuals and animation is beautiful and great. The action is exciting and thrilling. The plot is a little slower but it does travel into new territories with the characters and packs an emotional punch this time."
" As Awesome As the First
",2019-02-24 00:00:00,10,"Always worried about sequels but this one measured up in every way - plot, visuals, moral .... loved it!"
" Wonderful
",2019-02-21 00:00:00,7,Everythings is fine but why king was dead! but this part was interesting when whole dragon could fight with Drago.
" Not as good as the first one
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,4,"It's OK, but not near as good as the first one.
I think they got a little too high while writing the script.
Still good for the kids and clean fun for the family."
" BEST ANIMATION EVER
",2019-02-07 00:00:00,10,I've seen this film like 5 times and every time my heart beats in excitement. Not only are the characters loveable and amazing the soundtrack that accompanys the whole film is AMAZING! My all time favourite series
" A solid sequal
",2019-02-05 00:00:00,6,This movie carry's on from where the last one ended up and still a very good movie
" Super great
",2019-02-03 00:00:00,10,"I really mean this it's goooooood you have to watch it, I don't know about you guys but there's some minutes I almost cry, and other I couldn't stop smiling😭😂😂😂"
" How To Train Your Dragon 2 packs twice the amount of emotion and beautifully rendered dragon scales.
",2019-01-28 00:00:00,9,"When I said the first film caught me off guard with its surprising amount of intensity. Well, its sequel may have just bested it. From epic large scale battles on land, sea and air to investing character development between a broken family. This a near-perfect family adventure that is hands-down the best film from DreamWorks since 'Shrek 2'. Hiccup's village has now embraced dragons, and his thirst for exploration grows. Whilst venturing across the vast seas, he comes across an antagonising maniac who wants to conquer the world by controlling dragons. What this sequel does, which many fail to do, is mature the franchise. Hiccup and his viking friends are now young adults, and so their thought process and understanding of the world has matured with its audience. And I cannot understate how important that is. They could've easily replicated the original and played it safe, but evolving the characters through age allows more emotion to come through. The enamoured relationship between Hiccup and Toothless juxtaposes the fragmented bonds between Hiccup and his parents, and it works! It so works! And I found myself quickly becoming connected with every character and the tangible connections between them. Upon the arrival of the third act, DeBlois just puts everything on the table. Soaring dragon battles that lead to a sense of loss where Hiccup may actually not prevail. With so much at stake, you are automatically absorbed. The absolute gorgeous animation just complements the fantastical world that is presented. Lighting was improved, character models were smoother and the animation itself was divine. Improvements all round! Plenty of comic relief (particularly from Ruffnut) to ease the grandeur of its story and, well, packed with so much heart and sincerity that it often overwhelms. If it wasn't for Drago being underdeveloped as a villain, this may have got the perfect rating. Alas, it is an outstanding piece of animation from a series of high-flying films that came out of nowhere."
" A great sequel to a great movie
",2019-01-21 00:00:00,9,"Its hard to find such hard emotion into an animated film or just characters in general but Dreamworks Animation has done it again and arguably better than the original.
Great action and even better animation then the first can't wait to watch the 3rd."
" A sequel done right!
",2018-12-24 00:00:00,9,"How to Train Your Dragon 2 has everything that makes for a great cinematic expirience and a adds enough new stuff to make it one of those sequels which surpasses its predecessor.I had minor issues with the original HTTYD regarding its story which was this underdog story where the main focus was one the main character Hiccup's journey from being an outcast to becoming the one to save the day, which was a little predictable, but the animation was stil spectacular.In HTTYD2 the focus is more on the dragons and the world they live in and less on Hiccup. But we also get a new insight into his people and his family, and I'll admit that was engaging to watch. Throw in the amazing animation and an intimidating villain and you'll get an immersive fantasy world with a mature tone.If you get the opportunity to watch it on the big screen, do it! I did and it was amazing! HTTYD2 is a definite recommendation from me if you want to see more from this world of dragons."
" This... is Berk!
",2018-12-23 00:00:00,10,"You know, this movie was just as good as it's prequel. I was afraid this would be a let down, but thank God. I'm looking forward for the next part."
" a sequel that matches its predecessor
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,10,Review: I loved this movie because it begs the question what constitutes a pet and also can humans and animals be friends. The direction and screenplay are both incredible. The casting and acting are both incredible also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Heartwarming and heartwrenching, a movie done right!
",2018-11-13 00:00:00,10,"I never watched How to train your dragon, before today. I've laughed, cried and smiled, and I even learned a few lessons.
Amazing movie, for everyone, not just kids."
" Lacks the originality and charm of its predecessor.
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,6,"This sequel is a huge disappointment. The main problem lies with the narrative. While the original endeared viewers by eschewing the obvious and common narrative of good-versus-evil, encouraging people to be more understanding of others and finding nonviolent solutions to longstanding conflicts, the sequel instead revels in violence both to establish the plot and resolve the final conflict.To quench any moral qualms a viewer might have after internalizing the message of the first movie, the second one focuses its action on a suitably hateable, mean-looking, rough-sounding cardboard cut-out of a villain (boringly named Drago) that wears his intent to dominate and destroy on his sleeve.Visually, the movie looks just as stunning as its predecessor, but often the visuals don't match the narrative, as if there was little coordination between the script writers and the animation team. For example, the movie opens with a beautiful overhead shot of the gorgeous Viking settlement, Berk. ""It may not look like much"", Hiccup's voice-over comments without sarcasm. Doesn't look like much, really? Are we watching the same scene?More serious is the disconnect between narrative and visuals in the depiction of violence. In the movie's second act, two major characters (one dragon, one human) die violently in battle, but without any trace of blood. In fact, despite the extensive battle scenes, there are no visible injuries of any kind in this movie (excepting a broken tusk, and of course some fully-healed stumps). I understand that this is supposed to be a kid's movie, so obviously the animators didn't want to go all-out on the blood and gore, but it also feels wrong to make violent conflict look so inconsequential. Again, there seems to be a disconnect between the writers, who play up the violence for dramatic reasons, and animators, who tone it down to avoid scaring the children.The final confrontation between the villain's Alpha dragon and the hero's Toothless is similarly jarring. Visually, the Alpha looks like a hulking beast, thousands of times larger than any of the regular dragons, likely able to demolish Berk with a single charge. However, the plot dictates that Toothless will now defeat the Alpha, and thus this giant dragon does nothing but stand still and growl ineffectually. ""Fiiiight!"" the villain yells desperately, as he realizes his downfall approaches, and for once I sympathize.All in all, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is not a terrible movie, but it's so unoriginal that it's basically interchangeable with any of DreamWorks second tier works."
" This movie takes itself too seriously
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,6,"In How to Train Your Dragon 2's defense, I watched it at a drive-in movie theater, which automatically lessens the rating by at least half a star, due to audio/visual quality issues. This movie packs some good emotional punches, and the animation is appealing, but it just isn't as funny as the first film. And I think that it's because this movie takes itself too seriously that I didn't like it as much as the original. It's still worth a watch, though. My kids really enjoyed it."
" An extraordinary sequel
",2018-10-05 00:00:00,10,"Five years after Hiccup brought peace between Vikings and dragons, he spends his time mapping the unknown world with the help of his beloved companion, Toothless. In their quest, they discover that an old acquaintance of his father's is assembling a mighty dragon army in order to become supreme leader. With the help of a very unexpected person, which kidnaps him in the beginning, he must lead his people and his dragon, once again, to restore the much needed peace.This is the sequel to the best animation ever created (in my opinion of course) which, frankly, I was expecting it to be as Cars 2, an utter failure without any doubt. To my surprise, it had nothing to do with it and it proved me wrong once again, shouting loud and clear that you can create a very good movie in any circumstance if you really want to, and of course, have the power to do it. Visually speaking, it is simply astounding, enchanting your eyes with every scenery. Combined with the same funny, well-shaped and much better animated characters, it manages to create a superb atmosphere which can be hardly described using mere words.The creators achieved something wonderful with this film, creating an emotional and satisfying story which features interesting and entertaining events after the first one's finale. Although it isn't as mind blowing as the original, it is still a brilliant piece of animation. Hats down to them!"
" This is a warm-up version of Part 1 pissing on it.
",2018-09-18 00:00:00,2,"To be honest, I'm quite surprised apart from the animation in World Building and the music.
Everything has been messed up in this part. All things really all the things that I have so much revered in the first movie has been here once folded and pulled through the buttocks.
""Hiccup"" is no longer courageous but expresses his responsibility and his fate,
The mother whose death in the first part was still a linchpin of the parent's relationship turns out to be still alive but for that the dad just dies in a pretty stupid way, I just despised my favorite character ""Astrid"" in this movie because she is completely stupid and in some ways reminded me of ""Daphne from Scooby-Doo"". and also the rest of the dragon riders regardless of whether you know the TV series or not simply characterless and wrong behaves.I am even more offended than after ""Dragonball Evolution"", because this movie is successful.
Imagine a Harry Potter adaptation based on the blurb written by a one-armed dyslexic. And the super dubbing voice actor and voice actor make the whole thing even worse because it hurts to see how I wasted so much talent time and effort here.
Not all ideas are terrible, only the execution is the last and the super terrific animations work that has actually surpassed itself in this part kept me from turning off, however, it has not been able to reduce the suffering
I hate this movie because, in contrast to the first one, it's not good, it's just clichés without a clever twist or reissue, good characters destroyed, and some plot points just fetched from the bottom that foul the big picture with the still sticking chunk.
I hate this movie, all in all, it's not a good movie but in the overall standings, a low point in the movie series is a really bad sequel and an insult to the reputation of the franchise.I will always honor the first film but this sequel should die."
" Even better than the original.
",2018-07-03 00:00:00,9,To call it spectacular is too mild a word. This is perfection in every way. A lot more thrilling and exhilarating than the original. The animation is AMAZING. Definitely aimed at a more mature audience.
" Disappointing and for most part crappy
",2018-06-27 00:00:00,1,"I´m a huge fan of the first but this one was disappointing especially because of Valka she sucks, and her relationship issues with Hiccup were handled poorly(is this film for feminists or something ? such crap) and in a crappy way, the strong lies in Hiccup and Stoick and Hiccup and Toothless at the end."
" Even better than the first
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,9,"Love this film, this franchise, unlike frozen, has a soul, great and normal animation where everyone doesn't look like perfect Chinese manga girls like most Disney films, there is a dark twist, it isn't all lovey duby like most films and has a great ending. 
Love it, one of my favourite animated films"
" Throws out everything that made the first movie so magical
",2018-06-10 00:00:00,4,"Somehow, they managed to take everything that made the first movie so magical - and just throw it out of the window. The first movie is nothing short of a masterpiece. Sure, they could have picked a better title that would not give away from the very start that, well, they'll be training dragons. But that aside, the story of a village of vikings struggling against an onslaught of dragons, and, despite everything he's been taught, a boy and a dragon becoming best friends and changing the world together, sticking up for each other, is magical and simply grand. The sequel throws away the magic. Violence is abound. Toothless is portrayed as feeble-minded and dangerous. I have no idea what they were going for, and what kind of message they are trying to send.Harmless example: Hiccup is surrounded by dragons and the dragon rider leader. Toothless gets dropped in. The dragon rider waves, and all dragons threateningly open their mouths, revealing fire. Toothless immediately stands in front of Hiccup, and shields him with his tail - great. That's friendship right there. Now the dragon rider approaches, waves, and in the next moment Toothless rolls on the ground in glee, completely subdued. Is that supposed to tell me anything in particular about their relationship? Even if you stretch it reeeal far and claim that the dragon rider ""spoke"" to Toothless - it sure didn't take a lot to leave himself and Hiccup completely unprotected. Next example - yup, the death scene that everyone else complains about too. Within the blink of an eye Toothless becomes completely controlled by the Alpha (after Draco announces it, no less). Words aren't getting through, and in the next moment he fires at Stoick, killing him in an instant. Was that part of the plot really necessary? Should that show me a particularly deep friendship between Toothless and Hiccup, or a special bond that no one outside can touch? Never mind the fact that he did actually mean to kill Hiccup - essentially his best friend for many years. To me, it felt that this part was more of a ""gotcha"" from the writers, as if they were saying ""Hah, did you think his words would be coming through? Well, gotcha!!""In return however, Hiccup gets a second chance to get through to Toothless - without any imminent danger, all while the villain is grinning and waiting for Hiccup to make his move. And boy, does he rejoice when he gets through (""Atta boyyy, that's iiit!""). The death of his father is forgotten, and he gets crowned chief by the elder, complete with painting his face akin to The Lion King.They throw you another curve-ball at the end - just when you think ""okay, that's gotta be it"" - nop. The big bad Alpha freezes Hiccup in ice. ""Haha, did you think it was done? We gotcha again!"" But whoops, turns out Toothless protected him, so he gets out without a scratch, and now, after aaaaall this talk about ""peace and friendship"" the Alpha gets walloped like there is no tomorrow until its tusks break off - and that's finally it then. What exactly is supposed to be magic about that again?The entire movie is basically about who's controlling the dragons. The Alpha controls most dragons. Everyone controls Toothless - except Hiccup. The dragon rider waves her hand to make Toothless flop on the floor like a good doggy while Hiccup's presumably still in peril, she presses Toothless' buttons to make him sprout extra fins, Draco barely needs to show effort to get Toothless on his side -- and that's the pair that's supposed to have the deepest and most special bond among all of the characters?!
The magic from the first movie - that dragons are mysterious creatures with their own minds and notion of friendship is nothing but an empty shell here. The movie paints them as weak-minded, simply acting under whoever's the Alpha at the moment, and easily controlled by anyone who knows how to wave their hands in the right way.Contrast that to the first movie - yes, the dragons were bringing that huge dragon food - but it is made clear that they were tyrannized, and acted out of fear. Case in point, when they don't bring enough food, they get eaten. Nothing of that is necessary in this sequel - the Alpha just needs to make its eyes dance, and bamm, all the dragons follow its every command - not because of fear, but because of, you know, just because. Mind control, whee.On the plus side: good animation, good graphic effects, long. But that alone doesn't make a movie. Zootopia is animated better, with better graphic effects, and yet I'd say HTTYD 1 has a stronger message. I really don't want to bash sequels. I hope that the third part in 2019 brings back the magic from the first part. Judging by how much they aged, Toothless and Hiccup have been together for a decade, and they've been each others best friends for that long. Think of what that means. If I want pure action with a bunch of deaths I'd watch Aliens. This sequel tried to be everything - love, romance, action, drama, separation, loss, reunion - and diluted its core values with it. And that is a huge shame.I'd rate it a 4/10. It has its moments, but overall there is little to relive and to rewatch. Story-wise it's definitely a step down from the first part - which is also reflected on metareview sites. Please make part 3 good, at least."
" Amazing movie!
",2018-04-03 00:00:00,10,"This movie is amazing just like the first! In my opinion the first is better but this is still awesome! I loved this movie and I don't think I could made it better! Just like the first this movie has good comedy, action, character depth and an amazing main character. The thing I love most about this movie is hiccup and toothless! Hiccup is such a funny character in the first movie but in this one not so much however he manages to make for this by having an even stronger bond with toothless! If u guys see this movie anywhere please do urself a favor and watch this phenomenal movie!"
" Great animation.
",2018-03-29 00:00:00,9,"The animation in this movie is fantastic. This movie is worth watching just for the animation. It was already great in the first movie and now its even better.The story is where the problems come in. This movie is fun, and its great for a kids movie, but it is full of supposedly intelligent characters acting like complete morons. Most of the plot devices and conflicts are due to loss of logic and intelligence. This movie is bordering on Despicable Me 3 levels of how the characters figure out where other characters are and get to those places in like a minute of screen time. I know that they can fly around on dragons, and that there is some suspension of disbelief required, but this cliched mess is full of dumb plot devices. I did enjoy this movie, but there is no tension or suspense in it. There is however, a lot of stupid."
" IMDb needs to fix this
",2018-03-17 00:00:00,7,"Respectable and good. Not fantastic and not horrible. This is sort of a middle kind of deal. I remember watching and enjoying the first one - this on the other hand just seemed like a reacting sort of sequel, which most likely means it was forced out due to the wildly successful first film. Frankly it seemed rushed in parts and has bad pacing. But good action."
" The franchise continues to soar thanks to the film's compelling story, strong emotional depth, and characters that are still great
",2018-03-02 00:00:00,10,"Hi everyone. This is gavin.thelordofthefuture and today's the 2nd of March which means that the third and final installment of the How To Train Your Dragon trilogy will be out in one more year. So, I'm going to review this second installment that came out almost four years ago.After the success of the original film in 2010, DreamWorks started production on the sequel. Dean DeBlois, who directed the first film with Chris Sanders, revisited the films from his childhood, My Neighbor Totoro and The Empire Strikes Back as inspirations for the film to focus on the scope, the characters, and the fun. The original voice cast including Jay Baruchel, gerald Butler, Craig Ferguson, America Ferrera, Jonah Hill, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, T.J. Miller and Kristen Wiig returned fo the sequel along with three new additions like Cate Blanchett, Djimon Hounsou, and Kit Harrington from Game of Thrones. Then, after finishing the design and look of the film itself, it came out to theaters and was met with critical acclaim, with praise for it's animation, voice work, action sequences, John Powell's musical score, emotional depth for the characters, and the more darker and serious tone compared to the first film. So, having loved the original, this sequel blew away my expecations and is the best animated sequel from DreamWorks since Shrek 2, Kung Fu Panda 2, and Madagascar 3.How To Train Your Dragon 2 shows Hiccup trying to take responsibility when he becomes the chief of Berk. Suddenly, a threat occurs when the new villain named Drago Bludvist sets to conquer the world and it's up to him and the other dragon riders, along with Hiccup's long lost mother, Valka, to save it.This film is a reminder of a second installment done right. It reminds me of Kung Fu Panda 2, also a great sequel to the original film, which I also loved as well. Because not only does it provide a compelling story with breathtaking flying moments that are as good as the original film, excellent action sequences and emotional moments (the flashback of Valka being taken by the dragons, the reunion of Stoick and Valka, the death of Stoick (SPOILER ALERT to those who haven't seen the film yet), Hiccup's attempts to free Toothless from the Bewilderbeast's control with the power of compassion and friendship) but it does a great job in expanding on the original film by making the new characters and villain have a connection to how the war between the Vikings and Dragons started. The new characters are great. Valka (voiced by Lady Galadriel-I mean Cate Blanchett) is a female side character done really well because of her relationship with Hiccup and their perspectives on how to create peace for all the dragons and vikings of Berk. Eret, the dragon trapper and working for Drago Bludvist, is really entertaining and while having some menacing moments, he also has some hilarious moments. And last, but not least, Drago Bludvist. Some people considered him to be a generic villain wanting to conquer the world, but to me, he's one of DreamWorks Animation's best villains since Rameses, Tai Lung, and Lord Shen. The reason why his connection to how the war between Vikings and Dragons started make sense is because his people were slaughtered by dragons is what drives him to use dragons to bring fear to other people.That being said, the rest of the film maintains the same strengths that the original film had. Hiccup continues to be relatable due to his struggles by trying to take responsibility as chief of Berk and his relationships with Toothless, Astrid, Stoick, and Valka are beautifully written. The other dragon riders Astrid, Fishlegs, Snotlout, Tuffnut, and Ruffnut weren't given as much screentime, I'll admit, but they contributed a little bit more to the plot while still providing some great humor particularly with Ruffnut, whose expressions when encountering Eret became really hilarious. Stoick, whose stubborness changed after the end of the original film, is still a great chief and shared his emotional moments with Valka perfectly while Gobber is still a funny side character. The animation continues to be beautiful from the landscapes, the even more unique character animations and movements and expressions so beautiful. And last but not least, the music score from John Powell and he did a great job. He reprises the themes from the first film while introducing new themes for the new characters, but not only that. It retains the scottish tone and provides some really strong action music writing while also being as epic, dramatic, haunting, and emotional as ever.Overall, How To Train Your Dragon 2 not only managed to be as good as the original film, but reached the mature heights for DreamWorks Animation since The Prince of Egypt. I cannot wait for How To Train Your Dragon 3! Solid recommendation to fans! :)"
" YES YES YESSSS
",2018-02-02 00:00:00,10,"Wow. Now this is what I call a sequel. It sets that perfect tone then launches like a dragon and quickly sets the stage. Before you realize it, you're deeper in their world just like before. Dreamworks has done it again and done it beautifully. Loved it 10/10"
" Even better than HTTYD1
",2018-01-03 00:00:00,9,"Rarely a sequel is better than the first one, but here it is. The graphics are stunning, but more importantly the story deals with difficult questions. While the first movie was about trust and friendship, How to train your dragon 2 is about dealing with the death of relatives, becoming mature and being able to take responsibilities. It's a big step for a teenager becoming mature and this movie deals with it brilliantly. Yes it's an animated movie, but adults will like it as much as children. One to watch for the whole family. An epic movie."
" Very enjoyable sequel and great fun - go see it no matter your age!
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"If you haven't seen 'How To Train Your Dragon', you really should - it's a great animated film, not just for kids, with plenty of fun, a great cast, good story and it's brilliant to watch. This sequel does a rare thing - it is even more enjoyable than the original! The cast are all back again, but more importantly, so are the animators. I'm not sure how, but the detail, colours, movements and everything in this film are so vivid, it's truly astounding to watch.The story is relatively simple - someone's making a dragon army to conquer the free Vikings, so it's up to Hiccup (Baruchel) & Stoick (Butler) to save them. The twist comes with the introduction of Valka (Blanchett) and the dragon sanctuary she has created. Seeing where/how these hundreds of dragons is both amazing and strangely beautiful - and a little reminiscent of 'Avatar'. Needless to say, the clash of the two armies certainly makes for exciting viewing.There's some good morals of helping your friends and fighting for what's right for the kids, but still plenty for the adults. Much of this is thanks to the great support cast - Jonah Hill as Snotlout, T.J. Miller & Kristen Wiig as the twins, Chris Mintz-Plasse as Fishlegs and Kit Harrington/Jon Snow as Eret - they add the fun, banter and sidekick-ness to the film."
" How to Train Your Dragon 2 VS. Kung Fu Panda 2
",2017-11-30 00:00:00,6,"In this review I am comparing HTTYD 2, to KFP 2, because both films are DreamWorks Animation sequels and contain two very similar plots, in which one is family related and the other one is about stopping a central villain. The difference between those films however is that only one of them managed to tell its story right. (Spoilers for HTTYD 2 as well as KFP 2)KFP 2 starts with a short intro about the past of a character that will become the main villain of the story, Lord Shen. He was supposed to be heir of Gongnam City (not a known city in KFP 1. He discovered that Fireworks could be used as a modern weapon in order to take China, he was banish after wiping out the Panda's homelands after seeing a vision from a soothsayer that only a black and white warrior could prevent his plans. Years later Shen continued his plan nonetheless, followed by a village raid for resources his weapons. Po (who is now the Dragonwarrior) tried to stop them but meanwhile gets a short flashback of his mother after seeing a familiar Symbol carried by Shen's right hand. Later he asked Mr. Ping about his past, but in the end Po learned nothing other that he is adopted and raised by him. After that we see how Shen uses his secret weapon that can outmatch Kung Fu and both plots are more or less settled in only 20 minutes of the film.Now in HTTYD 2 we have to wait 30 minutes before one of the plots comes in light(Hiccup's missing mother) and we have to wait another 15 minutes before they finally introduced the main villain. The only things we know before that is that Eret works for him and that this villain went once to Berk and killed plenty of Vikings there, because they didn't want to obey him, but why not intimidate those Berkians with his dragons like the way he intimidates them? Oh and apparently he also managed to control an alpha dragon. How he did this is beyond me, but most of all his motive to conquer other people. After one hour Drago explains why he needs to intimidate all these dragons by literally showing his lose, caused by dragons and his motive is therefore to force dragons to work for him? He does not kill them though, he just uses them in his advantage to conquer other lands for no good reason actually, because his past is barely related to this. In short we got a villain with an illogical match between motive and that simply gives no satisfaction to Drago's character whatsoever.Shen in KFP 2 was far more compelling. He discovered a way to transform firework into a weapon he could use for greater goals. This makes it believable (enough) that this position makes him hungry for more power. It was from the message from a soothsayer that Shen went out to destroy those (the panda) who could be a thread to him should he continue with his plan, but therefore he got banned by his own parents. His character could've been handled better in the movie, but Shen's actions made far more sense in contrast to Drago. KFP 2 managed to connect the two plots too. I am not saying that different plots should be connected, but the way KFP 2 handled its story was more conherent and woven than HTTYD 2, which made the story more impactfull and comprehencive.HTTYD 2 kept the two plots separate and it was only at the middle where they come together. The problem with this is that the story loses its pace. It was after 30 minutes Hiccup coincidentally found his mother Valka(really do love the voice of Cate Blanchett) and after they got to her hideout. She said that she only left in order to 'protect' Hiccup, but against what? Dragons will still come to raid the village anyway. If she truly wanted to protect Hiccup and the villagers, then she would've taken every dragon away from Berk. The only reason why she left is because she disagrees about killing dragons, but that is nearly not good enough to disappear for good without even visiting the place. Valka's dicision to stay away simply does not make sense.There are plenty other questions I have for this film, for example: Why is everyone okay with that Valka left for 20 years, if that is the only reason? Hiccup did not care at all (only surprised), Stoick sang together with Valka like nothing ever happened and the rest did not bother. Also why does Valka continuously act that she knows who Hiccup is after knowing him in about 2 days? Saying that being Chief is who Hiccup is, while the one thing that we know for sure in HTTYD is that Hiccup is NOT a leader, but an explorer. Astrid on the other hand was a far more dominant character. She could've been a great leader, but in this film she turned into a tag-along rather than an independent character she used to be in HTTYD 1. Speaking of characters (Spoilers), Stoick died during the battle and surprisingly Drago just left Hiccup and the rest unharmed after he had the clear upperhand, but he has no reason to do so. Shen in KFP 2 would not have taken any risks. He would have finished the job, if it wasn't for Po's counter ability with 'inner peace'. Also why did no one either spoke or mentioned Stoick again after the funeral, they just got over it? This is very rushed and forced writing at this point. In KFP 2 the story started very early with emotional investment with Po and his dad(Goose), that last through the entire film. So why didn't they start with at least one emotional gripping conversation between father and son that also last through the whole film to make his death more emotional and memorable?In conclusion: The story of HTTYD 2 did not satisfy partly due to its pacing problems. They went for a slow mysterious approach rather than a swift, dynamic approach in KFP, which is fine, but the beginning was way too slow in order to tell all there is and as a result we got a very rushed middle and end. The choices of the characters Drago and Valka did not make sense. Astrid was not the real Astrid and the death of Stoick did not have anything memorable to it. I can only say that KFP 2 tells its story far more clever. It had a clear direction and the story had a very compelling villain with an interesting goal and motive, but above all it made sense, along with more development of the characters Po, Mr. Ping and Tigress. All in all HTTYD 2 is a mixed bag, It has its good moments but also plenty of very contriving elements that tearing the movie down from being good. Valka might had her reasons to leave the village. Drago might had his reasons to conquer Berk. But in this context they appear as merely plot movers not actual characters with good motive. Hiccup's character arc(from explorer to leader) could be interesting, but it was unfortunately too little too late."

" A thrilling, epic and fantastic sequel.
",2017-09-18 00:00:00,10,"Now this is how a sequel is done. For a while, I haven't seen a sequel to animated movie that is not only good, but better than the original. Until now. ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"" is the perfect description of a movie that conquers the first film and keep in mind, the original movie was probably the best animated movie DreamWorks has ever put out. This movie continues the story like a good sequel should and also ups the story, characters and animation in the process. I even think this is one of the best animated movies ever made and have so much to say about it.Five years have passed since the last film and the Viking village of Berk has evolved. The island now lives with their former nemesis, the dragons, in harmony and have even turned many of their former weapons of war into items of use for the dragons like turning giant torches into feeding stations. Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) and his dragon Toothless have been exploring and mapping islands outside of Berk in hopes of finding other dragon riders. He instead discovers dragon trappers who are seeking revenge after their fort was destroyed and solidified by ice. Led by Eret (Kit Harington), he reveals that the warlord Drago Bludvist (Djimon Hounsou) is raising an army full of dragons in hopes of conquering the world. After warning his father, the chieftain Stoik (Gerard Butler), the island of Berk is put in a secure state to protect the dragons in preparation for a war. Hiccup, believing the war can be avoided, leaves the island with his girlfriend Astrid (America Ferrera) in hopes to talk with Drago and prevent the battle not knowing that they aren't the only ones protecting dragons. I could tell you what happens next, but I'd rather not spoil the movie.While the last film was directed by ""Lilo and Stitch"" directors Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois, this film is rather written and directed by DeBlois himself who plans to turn the series into a trilogy. He claims he mostly got inspiration from ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and it clearly shows. The film does what a sequel should do. The film expands the world, introduces more new characters including more species of dragons and also the fun. The story is what I love about this film the most. It ups the emotion, heart and comedy from the previous movie while also taking the movie in a more darker and serious tone. One particular scene near the end of the film was so powerful that I actually did get a little teary eyed which is a very high compliment. The animation is some of the best put to film. With help from visual consultant Roger Deakins, the animation was so beautiful and even at times very realistic. There was one shot in the film involving glaciers that looked so realistic that I initially thought it was filmed on a camera. The character are again, fantastic. They evolve like characters should, while keeping their charm that we liked about them from the previous movie. The new characters are also fantastic with the villain Drago Bludvist being a genuinely unlikeable villain while having a believable backstory to explain his actions. My favorite character is still Toothless who can be both cute and funny at times while also being epic and awesome in others. I can go on forever praising this movie, but I'd rather not.""How to Train Your Dragon 2"" is one the best animated sequels ever made. This is a film that has everything I expect to a sequel. A story that is as good if not better than the original, some breathtakingly real animation, and fantastic memorable characters. It's really a fantastic movie and I'm pretty excited to see where the story goes next. There are many reasons why DreamWorks is considered one of the best animation studios in the business and this is most certainly one of them."
" Hiccup's growing up
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,6,"I'm going to be honest here and say that this chapter wasn't anywhere near as good as the first one, but then again that is generally what you get when you come to sequels. Maybe it had something to do with me being distracted, or maybe it was just that they were simply trying to cash in on the success of the first movie that they decided to head into sequel (and now trilogy) territory. Well, that sometimes works, and the movies were actually based on a series of books, but that does not necessarily mean that they actually follow the books all that closely (apparently they don't).Anyway, the film takes place five years after the previous film, and as we know from the end of the previous film all of the dragons moved in with the villagers and they are now part and parcel of their life. However, as Hiccup is out exploring he is attacked by some pirates, or more precisely dragon hunters, and discovers that there is this rather nefarious person out hunting all the dragons to create an army of dragons riders. Being the rather idealistic person that he is, Hiccup then decides to try and locate this fellow and attempt to convince him to have a change of heart (which we all know is going to fail abysmally).I guess this is in part a coming of age story, but then again the first movie was like that as well with Hiccup training to become a warrior, but instead of following the ways of the villagers, heading out on his own and actually changing the village for the better. This is the story that continues here, particularly since we learn that he doesn't have a mother (and even though it was never explicitly stated in the first movie, the lack of an older female figure in his life suggested that he may not have one). Of course, we also have his rather good heart, and his belief that he can change somebody through reasoning and a well founded argument – only to discover that unfortunately doesn't work.Yet even though it felt weaker than the first film, I still quite liked it. The film expanded the world somewhat, and we also discovered that there are many more varieties of dragons than what was introduced in the first film – including the gargantuan dragon who has the ability to control all other dragons in its vicinity. Of course, we have our antagonist, whose goals aren't that particularly clear, though we do know that he seems to have a chip on his shoulder with regards to dragons.In the end, even though I didn't find this anywhere near as good as the first one, it was still a really fun movie to watch, and I admit that in the end I did enjoy it."
" The true alpha – Night fury.
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,7,"What I most liked about the movie is how toothless gets over control of alpha and establishes his own self as alpha. Hiccup does not give up on his dragon despite his father's death. At last everything ends on good note.It is worth watching for adults as well as children.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: It is excellent.Tone: The tone relies on story where it is learnt how dragons can be controlled, mainly how alpha controls them and how can one achieve control over them for good or for bad. It is constructed well.Music: Music is average.It is worth watching multiple times."
" Equals, If Not Surpasses, The First
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,8,"How to Train Your Dragon 2 is the rare animated sequel that both goes deeper and is just as exciting as the original. The story takes place some years after the events in How to Train Your Dragon, the kid characters notably having matured to about their mid-teenage phase, and notably more experienced in their flying-dragons trade. From the beginning, it accepts the cooperation between Viking and dragon, flying and diving through the air, and we never doubt the logic of it.As the characters are more mature, so is, appropriately, the story, being more complex and darker than the original, without ever feeling like it's trying too hard to accomplish that. Hiccup and his loyal dragon Toothless are back, doing more impressive feats, going further and further from their home, exploring beautiful new environments and encountering new things, some friendly and many not. Our other Vikings and giant flying lizards in all their varieties (and solid voice work) are back from the original, and we see some new ones, including terrific sinister villain. But I hold back on telling too much, for to give much beyond the premise, and early scenes of discovery, would be a disservice to viewers coming to see it.This is an exhilarating, creative, and gorgeous piece of work, with hardly a dull moment to be found. It's not quite a perfect or near perfect animated film, with some tired humor and a bit of a rushed ending. Still it's one of DreamWorks' best efforts to date, so definitely see it."
" Potential for an all time classic.
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,8,"One must start with pointing out the two protagonists: Hiccup & Toothless. Among the several 'handicapped' protagonists I have come across over the years, Hiccup & Toothless are by far the only ones who do not garner even the tiniest bit of sympathy over their handicap, flaunting it all the way through. Elsewhere, with handicapped leads, their handicap mostly balances out their amazingness: either their intelligence, niceness, brilliance, or just to increase the attention. On the contrary, for Hiccup & Toothless, despite their matching missing leg & tail, the handicap, if anything, only adds to their amazingness and uniqueness, though you nearly forget about it at most times. Although the storyline for How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a bit 'grown-up' than its predecessor, it still is a pleasant couple of hours for every age group. A big thanks for such attention to detail, brilliant colors & above all, the voice cast. Also, very few movies manage to deliver it a second time through. However, this movie certainly delivers to it by improving on the smallest of details and all new add-ons that complement those present. A solid 8-8.5. Dreamworks does it again with the new mature & confident...err Hiccup!"
" I did not like it
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,3,"The reason I put 3 stars at first place it is because it had nice graphics. Other than that the movie was terrible. Spoiler alert!! Hiccup's mother left them and never came back because she was looking after dragons?? Stupid His father and mother find each other after so many years and they want to start over (WHY? she abandoned them) anw and then he dies?? He dies because of toothless who was under mind control? Sad The good alpha dragon just died?? Toothless and Hiccups remain best friends even after toothless killed Hiccups' dad? All these do not make sense The movie had no plot It was terrible Plus the person who makes Hiccups' voice has a deeply annoying voice. It is not a cartoon movie for kids. It is very dark. And the first one was dark but this one is worse. I think it should be a pg13 movie. The feeling after watching the film was sadness and disappointment. I like cartoons, I liked the first one too. But this it was a big failure"
" A sequel that is as good as the original
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,9,"Five years have passed since the events of the first film and the people in the Viking village of Berk now live in peace with dragons. Hiccup has been told by his father that it is time for him to take over as village chief; however he doesn't feel ready. He wants to continue mapping undiscovered parts of the world with the help of his dragon Toothless. On one such flight they find a burnt village; it is a village of dragon catchers who are working for Drago Bludvist who wants them for his dragon army. His father tells him that Drago is a violent warlord who poses an imminent threat; Hiccup believes that he can talk to Drago and persuade him to live in peace. While trying to find Drago he encounters the mysterious 'Dragon Rider' who turns out to be someone surprisingly close to him that everybody thought had died years before. She lives with dragons in their vast, remote nest. Astrid and Hiccup's other friends try to help him find Drago but are captured and soon Drago is attacking the dragon nest with tragic consequences. He then sets off to attack Berk; Hiccup and his friends will have their toughest struggle yet if they are to keep the world safe for both humans and dragons.I enjoyed the original 'How to Train Your Dragon' far more than I expected so was very pleased that this sequel managed to live up to the original. While watching the original probably isn't absolutely essential I think one should try to watch it before this as it introduces the key characters and their situation; this would probably lose a lot of its depth without that prior knowledge. I was not surprised to read that director Dean DeBlois was inspired by 'The Empire Strikes Back' as this film is considerably darker than the original, especially in the middle section where a major character is killed. There are some clichés but that didn't bother me to much as the story was good. As before the animation is top notch; the many flight sequences are particularly spectacular. As well as action and tragedy there is of course a decent amount of comedy which is funny without being too goofy. Overall I heartily recommend this to anybody who enjoyed the original and look forward to seeing the third film in the trilogy when in eventually gets made."
" Best animation ever !
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,10,"I hardly have any words to describe this piece of art.I fell in love from the very first time i have watched it.The story is very amazing and satisfying and the animation art is so beautiful.The characters are very well chosen for this type of story.The film gives an introduction to the people and especially the young generation that the only beings that do harm and evil to anyone, even to themselves were the people and teaches us to be more kind to others and to respect the surrounding around us world that for me was quite enlightening to today's harsh world. Hardly recommend this to people who are dragon fans and not only.All i can say is great job Dream Works. Once again you bring happiness to the people around the world with your wonderful movies.My personal score 10/10 ! Can't wait for the next movie ! <3"
