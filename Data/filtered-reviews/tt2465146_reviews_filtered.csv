" Cheesy as hell, but has its moments
",2021-04-10 00:00:00,6,"Hey it's a Rob Reiner movie, what could possibly go wrong? Not too much, but he's coasting here, and even indulging himself with a minor role. It's not terrible but it is derivative, with Keaton doing her adorable kooky self and Douglas his mean mother routine, concealing a heart of gold. Echoes of Bill Murray in St Vincent with his child-phobia or Nicholson in As Good As it Gets with his misogyny, they inevitably get together and it all ends in a pretty saccharine love-in. Lots of ethnic minority casting and an adorable kid, you'll either surrender to its charms or reach for the sick bag."
" Brilliant! Rob Reiner Rocks
",2021-04-04 00:00:00,10,"Michael Douglas is trying to sell his 8.6 million dollar house in Connecticut so he can retire to Vermont. He owns an apartment complex by the water and is living there until the house sells. His son has a daughter who must stay with him while the son goes to jail for 7 months. Diane Keaton has the apartment next door and takes the girl in. Above live a cop and his pregnant wife. Douglas pays the cop to find his son's daughter's mother. When they bring the daughter to meet her mother on her 10th birthday, it is a short meeting that may never happen again. Douglas gets Keaton a higher paying singing job
He sells his house to a New York Mets player, and they pay cash. Douglas gets his son a lawyer and gives him his apartment. The ending is wonderful. The songs are great. Keaton sings The Shadow of Your Smile so beautifully. This is a well told story."
" Really?
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,2,"I can't be bothered to explain. It's just awful. I mean, it's demeaning to women, trivial and I wish Diane Keaton had more self respect."
" So bad. So sweet. So sickening.
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,1,"Do Americans actually like films like this? Do they think this a a good film? A well written fim? With good acting? Are they that dim?This is utterly appalling. Diane Keaton is a terrible actress. You can see her acting all the time. That stupid grin. The hand waving. Then we have to endure her singing. Or miming.Michael Douglas should be ashamed of himself. Hang up your coat, pal. Think of your dad.This is lazy film making in the extreme. Dull dull dull. Grumpy old man hates children and dogs and silly women. Within a merciful 93 minutes he lives children and dogs and light weight dim women. Oh, surprise there then.Please don't waste your time on this sickly sweet purely American rubbish. Let them enjoy it if that's what they want. We have brain cells on this side of the pond."
" Michael Douglas & Diane Keaton are the best.
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,10,"For me, this was one of the best and funniest movies I ever watched. I couldn't stop laughing. Diane Keaton and Michael Douglas are at the top of their game. Thank You Very Much. Great memories.J.P."
" A Sweet Film with Something to Say
",2020-06-23 00:00:00,8,"This was a charming little film I was lucky enough to stumble into thru Youtube. Setting is pretty, cast are different - not all the Usual Suspects. So maybe it doesn't stretch Diane Keaton and Michael Douglas to the very edge of their very fine acting abilities, but it is a good enouhg pleasant piece with just enought to show us about relationships, love in later life, family relations.... to definitely be worth the time. I find it quite satisfactroy."
" Meh
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,2,"Can't stand Diane Keaton on her best day and this didn't change my mind. She phoned it in. Her repetitious under-her-breath murmured ""ums and ohs"" fillers are so GD annoying. Douglas was fine, for what it was, miles better than Keaton. I DID watch the whole thing, unusual for me with a Keaton movie."
" Good idea poorly executed
",2020-03-23 00:00:00,1,"22MAR2020 {1/10 stars F} Recommend? No; The general idea of the movie is good, the acting is mediocre and the plot includes a lot of unnecessary foul content.I did not choose to play this movie, but watched anyway. Oren spends at least half the movie being an occasional racist and grouchy scrooge. Rob Reiner's only purpose in this movie is cheap comedy relief that is very lame and unmemorable. By the end of the movie the main characters are smiling and live happily ever after.CONTENT ADVISORY: Sarcastic comment from Oren, ""Rape is just another sign of affection"", sh't, d'ck, smart-ass, Christ and Jesus x2 said as expletive, Oren telling Sarah to avoid a boy playing in their yard because the boy showed his p'nis, Oren shoots a dog with a paintball gun to stop it from pooping in his yard, same dog later shown humping Sarah's large stuffed bear, Sarah's mom said to be a drug addict, Sarah meets her mom for the first time and her mom is shown collapsing on the ground disoriented and high when Sarah comes to meet her for the first time.Leah briefly talks about having a miscarriage, responsible wine drinking shown followed by Oren taking a swig from the bottle. Oren and Leah shown in bed covered by a blanket and Oren talking about how great she was and how he likes her body followed by her getting angry at Oren for them having sex and she says the word orgasm. Oren talks about the unplanned sexual activity at the real estate office with Claire and Oren and Leah talk about it again together. Oren says that Leah has slept with Elvis to entice a restaurant manager to pay Leah to sing at the restaurant. Oren and the restaurant manager haggle over what Leah should be paid and the manager says Oren is busting his balls by asking for Leah to be paid a higher amount to sing at the restaurant.Sarah watching neighbor Kennedy moan and yell in pain while she starts giving birth and Oren tells Sarah this is what happens when you have sex. Oren helps Kennedy give birth and has to remove her underwear, after removing the underwear he looks between her legs and says, ""There's a head in your vagina."" Claire sarcastically replies ""Blow me"" to a comment from Ted.{1=F 2=D- 3=D 4=C- 5=C 6=B- 7=B 8=A- 9=A 10=A+}"
" Enjoyable
",2020-02-21 00:00:00,10,"Have ALWAYS been a fan of Michael Douglas.Some have compared this movie to, ""Something's Gotta Give"" and ""As Good As It Gets.""Those movies rate a ZERO in my book, because I don't like Jack Nicholson, never have.Diane Keaton and the other actors/actresses were good too."
" Sort of a high end Hallmark film
",2019-11-15 00:00:00,6,"If you're looking for a feel good commodity entertainment this should fill the bill. Talent, committment, beautiful location, quality production elements are all here. Predictable character arc, quirky, likable supporting characters. It checks all the boxes! My cynicism is split between this manipulative story and and my emotions falling right in line with it's beats."
" Great movie!
",2019-11-11 00:00:00,10,"Great acting. Solid storyline. I am so tired of theses immature youngsters giving decent movies 1 star, it's ridiculous."
" Life is an animal thing
",2019-09-27 00:00:00,7,"The name of the film should hold everything it stands for.So you have this movie which could be criticized by viewers in one way or another.
The protagonists carry the movie towards the end of their lives.Life is about the height of connections we develop for someone or some place,which we hold dear to our hearts, even till the end. It is this endearment that moves life forward despite the end which results in nothing.The stray dog and caterpillar are taken to draw parallels with our lives, which we sometimes do,despite having no species similarities with any of them."
" Good if you need to kill some time at evening
",2019-08-24 00:00:00,6,Good if you need to kill some time at evening. Nothing special just another so called story of their life
" I ALREADY TRIED TO RAISE A KID ONCE. IT DIDN'T WORK OUT.
",2018-11-30 00:00:00,7,"Oren Little (Michael Douglas) is a successful Connecticut real estate agent wanting to sell his $5.8 million dollar home for $8.6 million. Being an old white guy he makes politically incorrect statements without knowing he is offensive. He lives in a converted apartment building that he also owns. His wife has passed on years ago, but he has trouble moving on creating a rough exterior. Like most people in Connecticut, he dreams of living in Vermont.Leah (Diane Keaton) is his neighbor, lounge singer. She too has issues in dealing with a lost spouse. (Guess where this goes.) Out of the blue, Oren's long lost , former drug user son Luke (Scott Shepherd) shows up. He is going to spend a few months in prison and needs Oren to look after his 10 year old well adjusted daughter Sarah (Sterling Jerins) named after grandma, Oren's wife. Oren refuses but gets stuck with her anyway as she becomes a project for both Oren and Leah.The film is formula. The on screen chemistry is hit or miss and doesn't seemed to be operating on all cylinders. There weren't any heavy Puffs' moments.The take away for guys is that after sex, women require 10 minutes of cuddling...try not to get caught looking at the clock.Parental Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity. Implied sex. Sex/drug references."
" Baby Boomers in Retirement
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,7,"Oren Little (Michael Douglas) is one of four tenants at the Shangrila located along the water of a beach town. Oren has turned into a grumpy old man since his wife died. Leah the widow next (Diane Keaton) door and can't seem to stop crying about her husband during her cabaret performances. Oren is in the process of selling the family home when his estranged son Luke (Scott Shepard) shows up with daughter Sarah. From here it gets predictable, but I liked Douglas and Keaton together. Music reminded me of the Big Chill. Was surprised Keaton could sing and that Rob Reiner was not only in the film as Arte, Leah's manager, but also co-produced the film. Great movie for at home dinner and a move with gal-pals"
" Where did the dog go?
",2018-05-06 00:00:00,8,"Ok, so I am a sucker for dogs. He was huge and sweet, but what happened (as hill likes to say)I did not think it was offensive, just funny! Get a life people! Keaton's singing wasn't that bad but her back story was lacking! I loved when she yelled ""I'm 65"" looked at herself with a hilarious gesture and said yechhh! Douglas calms down grows a heart and loves his grand baby It's watchable! But the dog! Really, not even in the final scene? Picked up in the Kidd,e of nowhere! I give up"
" Watchable but certainly not core shaking
",2017-08-12 00:00:00,6,"Keaton and Douglas are Leah and Oren, a couple of widowed neighbors, living in an idyllic mini-condo in a beautiful estate. Oren is a realtor who owns several properties, among which the building where Leah, himself and a few other people live. Oren wants to leave for Vermont, but must make his last sale: his own beautiful house, worth millions. One day he meets his estranged, turbulent son Luke who is about to go to jail.Luke has a daughter, Sarah, and he need his father to take care of her while he is doing his time. Initially reluctant and forcing Leah to take Sarah in, Oren starts to melt and from then on, you can easily predict the rest of the plot. Nevertheless, it is a rather enjoyable ride. Keaton plays more or less the same part she played in ""Something's got to give"", perhaps overdoing the similarities (even a crying scene), but she is believable as the aging lounge singer with a broken heart. Besides, I really loved her wardrobe. She has impeccable taste and looked great.I also liked Sternhagen (Bonnie from Sex and the City), who was hilarious as Claire, Oren friend and co-worker. What I liked slightly less was Oren befriending very quickly the whole bunch of neighbors and the totally unbelievable scene of a pregnant woman giving birth on his couch - that stretched it a bit too far.However, it was also refreshing to watch a movie for grown-ups not involving any of the following: indestructible super-heroes; vampires; revengeful cops; guns; killing; torture and violence in general. PS even without a plot, the most memorable part of the movie is the settings in what I gather must be an exclusive, immaculate estate."
" Has good moments
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,6,"This movie is an attempt to create a romantic story about elder adults, but I don't think Douglas and Keaton has a good connection, I don't see that spark and charm between them, they look like very forced to be in love. Douglas is not the kind of actor that can play this kind of roles, he lacks Charm, but Nicholson is way better than Douglas playing this type of role. The movie is not bad, but is not good as you may think due the actors are great Hollywood stars. The Movie also has some specific short moments of Racism and you can never have racism in a romantic movie. If the racism were managed with humor, that could fit in the movie, but Douglas is a very serious actor, he is not as good as comedian, In this case the movie has some deep good moments, but overall I can say this movie, has not been good as I expected. 6/10"
