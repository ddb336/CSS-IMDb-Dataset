" Up and down movie but still hilarious
",2021-02-05 00:00:00,8,"I was very hesitant to watch this movie considering well its a sequel to an already great movie with ad lib style humor. But I must say reading some of these reviews... I was so happy with how the movie came out. I was laughing throughout the movie, the first movie is all good times for sure and beer chasers but this ones a whole other level of mind expanding humor. Even with a shorten cast and the addition of a new person in the team of time travelers, I honestly think this movie was better than the first and memorable on its on."
" Funny-ish!
",2020-11-05 00:00:00,6,"I am a fan of the first film, its stupid but gave me a lot of laughs.HTTM 2 is also stupid but gave me less laughs, some of them them quite good but mostly chuckles.The sequel provides an interesting enough story, and the characters, well you either like them or you don't.Harmless, silly fun :)"
" Massive Let Down
",2020-08-25 00:00:00,3,"I loved the first one and thought it totally left the audience wanting more, especially regarding Cincinnati.However, this movie was a complete disappointment that failed to find the chemistry and story arcs that made the first one great. I've rarely felt more let down by a sequel that I was with HTTM 2"
" Actually, not that bad
",2020-07-30 00:00:00,6,"Hot Tub Time Machine 2 is without John Cusack, but is better than I originally thought it would be. Granted, this is not as good as the 1st film and certainly not a classic. However, it is decent way to kill an hour and a half. The movie goes the Back To The Future 2 route, by going to the future. This is not nearly as good or work as well as Back To The Future 2 either and is much less original and relies heavily on cliches. The narrative gets a little hazy and not all of the jokes are funny, but the film does have its moments. I was expecting this to be terrible, but it's still watchable, mostly funny comedy."
" Absolutely Awful
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,1,"A waste of time is an understatement. This is such garbage, that you have to question the morals of the actors for accepting money for this. The first 'HTTM' wasn't amazing, but it had some moments. This on the other hand, has absolutely nothing. Time to plunger myself like Ace Ventura."
" Sometimes crudeness is funny... sometimes it is just crude
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,4,"Opening five years after the events of the first film Lou Dorchen and Nick Webber have become very successful thanks to using other people's ideas. Then, at a party, Lou is shot in the groin and later dies. His son Jacob and Nick drag him to the time machine and they hope to travel back in time to stop the shooting... they actually end up in the future; a time when their lives are somewhat different. Evidence suggests that the killer is from this time period; the trio will have to find the killer before he goes back to commit the crime. They suspect former friend Adam Yates who was bitter after missing the trip in the first film that led to Lou and Nick's success. They find his son Adan Jnr, and he joins the search. In what follows they get into a number of sticky situations.This sequel was rather disappointing; there were some genuinely funny moments but too many gags relied on the fact that Lou is a thoroughly unpleasant character... he is a bully who more often than not gets away with it. Most of the gags are fairly crude without the wit to be funny. The film is clearly inspired by numerous other time travel films, which are inevitably name checked by the characters. The cast do a decent enough job with the material. Overall this is far from a must see but if you like your comedies crude you might enjoy it... I'm just glad it only cost me 50p and that went to a charity!"
" Do the Strut
",2019-09-20 00:00:00,9,"I found it a bit better than the first.Good: Pacing, story, mystery and the story was far more intriguing than anything the MCU has produced.
This was a comedy and it had a more serious feel than most MCU movies.Bad: The game show scene. Obnoxious immature character behaviors. Drugs, alcohol and sex jokes still seem fresh after being overdone for decades now.Recommendation: To time travel lovers and comedy likers.Overall a good movie i hope for a final 3rd."
" my notes
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,6,Pretty funny. but lots of stupid non-funny stuff. also the story kinda made no sense which woulda been ok if they didn't keep trying to make it seem like it made sense (1 viewing)
" What was that s$&@
",2019-03-20 00:00:00,9,The producers should all get 10 years for put the public through that garbage
" Wow!
",2019-01-11 00:00:00,1,"This movie was so bad, iI wish I could have give it -10 points. Seriously it was my worst 100 minutes by far ever. I watch it because i saw the first one and I DIDN'T EVEN LIKE THE FIRST ONE."
" never do second movie
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,6,I always love time traval stuff. But why is the every sequel movie sucks.
" HOW ABOUT A SPOILER ALERT?
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,4,"Lou (Rob Corddry) starts Lougle and becomes an obnoxious billionaire. During a party Lou gets shot in the nads and the group hops in the time machine to prevent the fatal event only to find themselves in the future looking for the killer. The film has a number of bad scenes that didn't work. There were long exhausting references to other films as well as a boring ""you look like..."" episode. The film drops plenty of F-bombs, has one scene of man swinging his genitals that lacked the humor it pretended to have and a lone set of boobs (Bianca Haase ?).The film was generally crude with many attempts at homosexual humor that should amuse the most immature among us. the film was idiotic and a waste. Worse than ""Hangover 3""Wait for a cheap rental."
" Worst movie ever
",2018-09-18 00:00:00,1,"I have never wrote a review before, but this film is sooooooo bad I just had to. If I could give this film a minus I would of. There is literally nothing good I can say about it. It's possibly the worst acting I have ever seen, if you want to save your eyes never ever watch this movie"
" All time favorite
",2018-09-18 00:00:00,10,I love this more than the first one and for those of you who gave it a bad rating. If you didn't like the first one why did you even bother watching the second one? You're not a paid critic so what business do you have giving us bad advice? Keep your opinion to yourself. This movie was absolutely hilarious I want a third one!!#
" Hot Tub Time Machine 2
",2018-08-27 00:00:00,2,"The first movie was easy to swallow funny time-travelling adventure, and obviously a hit, hence a sequel followed, all but John Cusack returned, this was probably the start of the problems, and negative reviews followed, but I was still going to give it a go. Basically five years have passed since the Lou Dorchen (Rob Corddry) and Nick Webber (Craig Robinson) changed their lives with the help of the hot tub time machine, Lou is now a multi-billionaire running successful search engine Lougle, and Nick is a successful singer-songwriter. At a celebratory party, Lou is shot in the groin, he, Nick and Lou's son Jacob Dorchen (Clark Duke) did not see the shooter. Jacob and Nick rag Lou into the hot tub time machine and activate it to travel back in time to find and stop the killer. They awaken after boozing to find themselves ten years in the future, where Jacob is in charge of Lou's mansion, and their faces appear older in the mirror reflections, this is what other people see. Jacob determines they are in alternative timeline where Lou's killed is from the future. They go to find their friend Adam Yates at his home, only to meet his son, Adam Yates Stedmeyer (Adam Scott) who is engaged to a girl named Jill (Gillian Jacobs). Lou suspects his nemesis Gary Winkle (Jason Jones) is the killer, but he has actually made his own fortune, the group later party at Gary's nightclub, where Adam Jr. takes his first hallucinogenic drug. The next day, they attend the popular television game show Choozy Doozy, where contestant Nick, who invented an infectious but annoying dance craze, is required to have virtual reality sex with a man. Lou is forced to participate with him, but uses a ""lifeline"" to switch with Adam Jr. Jacob becomes disillusioned by the misadventures and leaves the group to get drunk and then attempt suicide, jumping off a high building, Lou makes amends with him and prevents his suicide. The guys see a news report Brad (Kumail Nanjiani), an employee at Lougle, has invented nitrotrinadium, the ingredient that activates the hot tub time machine, they suspect he is the killer. At Adam Jr's wedding, Jacob talks to Brad and realises he is not the killer, he invented the chemical after being inspired to Lou. Kill is upset with Adam Jr's partying, she has sex with Lou, Adam Jr. finds out, and steals the nitrotrinadium and goes back to the past. Jacob, Nick and Lou return to the mansion, but are too late to stop Adam Jr., they sit in defeat, but Jacob realises that because the chemical has appeared in the past, it now exists in the future. They travel to the present and stop Adam Jr. from shooting Lou after he apologises to him. Following this incident, Nick apologises to his wife Courtney (Kellee Stewart), the more optimistic Jacob approaches Sophie (Bianca Haase) (his girlfriend in the future) to be in a relationship with him, and Adam Jr. meets Jill for the first time. As Lou, Nick, Jacob, and Adam Jr. return to the hot tub, Lou's head is shot off by a Lou from the past, dressed as a patriot, he informs them there are multiple Lous throughout history, he invites them to ""make America happen"". During the closing credits, the guys are seen exploiting the time machine to change history, including saving Lincoln from getting assassinated, Adam Jr. being the first man on the moon, Jacob having sex with Marilyn Monroe, discussing time travel with Albert Einstein, and even becoming The Beatles. Also starring Chevy Chase as Hot Tub Repairman, Collette Wolfe as Kelly, Christian Slater as Game Show Host and Lisa Loeb. Corddry is much more vulgar, and not in a good way, Robinson and Duke have lost some of their charm as well, the boorish and crude nature of the first movie was good for laughs, but this follow-up is overloaded with it that it is not all that funny, the story is fairly predictable, the explanations of time travel and timelines become almost complicated, and it filled with much more overly disgusting gross-out ""humour"", the most horrific being a swollen penis being burst by a syringe and exploding ""ball juice"", definitely not a movie to revisit, an awful science-fiction comedy. Pretty poor!"
" Garbage
",2018-07-13 00:00:00,2,"I watched the first Hot Tub Time Machine Last night in preparation for the sequel. The first one is a very funny well put together movie, nostalgic, clever and cool. After watching it I was all excited for the next movie, however ten minutes in there was still no sign of John Cusack. Not a good sign... It then became obvious that this movie was a piece of turd. Simply put: this thing was shabbily made in an attempt to cash in on the mediocre success of the first one. I imagine Cusack took one look at the script and said no clucking way. I suggest you do the same and avoid this hack garbage."
" Underrated Sequel
",2017-12-05 00:00:00,8,"I don't think this movie gets enough credit. The cast is hilarious, and getting rid of John Cusack only made it funnier. Comedies get a bad rap on this site for some reason... this was well written and well delivered. Rob Courdroy is another underrated hilarious actor. Craig Robinson stealing music from pop stars is also just so good. He needs to be in more stuff"
" And The Reason for this film is what?
",2017-08-27 00:00:00,1,"A part of me is wondering whether the universe (or I should say God, because as far as I'm concerned the universe doesn't have any personality) is trying to prevent me from writing this review. Well, maybe it is just bad luck that this is my third attempt, after having my computer freeze twice before while I was writing this, but hopefully this will be a successful attempt, particularly since my comments of this film aren't going to be all that flattering. Actually, I am somewhat surprised that I am writing this review in the first place, but then again, since I recently watched the previous film (and a second time at that, for some unknown reason), and having discovered a sequel, a part of me simply couldn't rest until I had watched it.I am also wondering why they even bothered with a sequel, but in a world where decisions are dictated by money, and profit, the fact that they made a sequel indicates that the previous film justified it, though it didn't justify it enough to have John Cusack make a return to his role (though he does appear a couple of times during the film). Instead he is mostly off stage, and only appears at the end, which I have to admit actually made what was in effect a pretty bad film even worse. Then again, having a film about a group of losers travelling through time, in a hot tub of all things, really does give one an idea of what this film is actually about.As with the previous film, expect some T&A, and also expect to be grossed out somewhat as well, though I have to admit that these days films have become much grosser than they were when I was growing up. Sure, there have always been T&A movies, but producers, and directors, have been forever pushing the boundaries further and further out as time goes on. Actually, while the T&A aspect doesn't really bother me that much (I am a child of the eighties), the whole aspect of grossing out the audience does really put me off somewhat.The previous film had our protagonists travel back in time to a memorial point in their past, which they changed for the better. However, the second movies reveals that despite the fact that Lou is a billionaire, and Nick is a famous singer, their lives aren't necessarily better. In fact the whole reason they travel back in time is because Lou is shot and the jump in the time machine (or hot tub, or what you will), in an attempt to save him. However, he is sent into the future as opposed to the past, what suggests that the reason he is shot is due to something that happened in the future, as opposed to the past.There were a couple of cool moments in the film, particularly the Choozeydoozey part, but it also seemed as if they pretty much took the frame from the original film and just changed what was actually happening. It was also offensive on so many levels, but I guess that was part of the intention of the film. The other thing was that I really didn't like Lou, but I suspect there is a really good reason for that – you aren't supposed to like him. They sort of do solve that in the end, but still, I personally wouldn't recommend wasting your time with this piece of rubbish."
" They must fix events in the future to fix the present, as the present day accident was caused by someone who came back from the future.
",2017-08-07 00:00:00,5,"This movie begins in the year 2015—that is the year 2015 in the altered universe created by Nick (Craig Robinson) Lou (Rob Corddry), and Lou's son Jacob (Clark Duke) in Hot Tub Time Machine (2010). An unfortunate accident causes the gentlemen to seek out the tub to go back in time to prevent the accident from happening. In their attempt they find themselves in the future, learning that they must fix events in the future to fix the present, as the present day accident was caused by someone who came back from the future. Confused? Well I can't blame you. I understood it completely, but I personally can't stand these time travel movies, whether serious science fiction, or comedy. I guess this movie actually spoofs on just how convoluted it is, and they even mention several films where this happens such as Back to the Future (1985), The Terminator (1984), and the TV Show Fringe (2008-2013). In the first movie the time travel concept was kept simple, and the humor was enough to outweigh the time travel concepts. I quite enjoyed the first one. This one, not as much. A decent comedy, and I suppose the plot was clever—time travel is just a topic I never really care for."
