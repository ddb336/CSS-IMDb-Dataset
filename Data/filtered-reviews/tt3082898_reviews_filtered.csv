" Revenge story...
",2021-02-11 00:00:00,5,"""Kickboxer: Vengeance"" is an Action - Crime movie in which we watch a man going to Thailand to challenge a Muay Thai champion who defeated his brother. He wants to take revenge and he will do anything to succeed.I did not have high expectations from this movie and I was not disappointed by it. It's an entertaining action movie with a very simple plot and nothing more. The direction which was made by John Stockwell, it was average but he succeeded on creating a good atmosphere with some action scenes that were full of suspense. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, both the interpretations of Alain Moussi who played as Kurt Sloane and Jean-Claude Van Damme who played as Master Durand were good and followed the classic relationship between a coach and an athlete. Finally, I have to say that ""Kickboxer: Vengeance"" is an average action movie that if you are a fan of this kind of movies I am sure that you will love it, otherwise you will feel that you wasted your time."
" ""You wake up at 5, no coffee breaks""
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,7,"The original 'Kickboxer' is a minor classic of 80s martial arts cinema, but truth be told it has aged. It helped cement Jean-Claude Van Damme as a star and did kickstart a mini DTV franchise, but watch it now and there's surprisingly little fighting. The emphasis is mainly on the gruelling training sequences and the physical abilities of the lead, but it does come across a bit like it was riding the coat tails of 'Rocky' and other bigger, better films.Flash forward to 2016 and we get this, the remake-slash-reboot. And while the word ""remake"" is anathema to some movie goers, 'Kickboxer: Vengeance' is pretty good. It won't usurp the original's classic status and again, it's not as good as other similar films (hello 'Warrior'). It is however a solid ninety minute MMA actioner, with loads more fighting than its parent. It's flawed and there are wrinkles that could have been ironed out, but for the most part 'Kickboxer: Vengeance' does a really decent job at updating the series.The film tells the story of Kurt Sloane (Alain Moussi, 'V-Wars,' 'Jiu-Jitsu'), younger brother of celebrated fighter Eric Sloane (Darren Shahlavi, 'Ip Man 2,' 'Mortal Kombat Legacy'). When Eric is killed in an underground fight in Thailand, he sets off on a mission of revenge against Eric's killer, the towering Tong-Po (Dave Bautista, 'Guardians Of The Galaxy,' 'Spectre'). Faced with threats from Tong-Po's cult-like following and clearly no match for the giant, Kurt turns to Eric's trainer Durand to help get him in shape, leading to a hefty amount of fisticuffs and tremendous physical pain.And it's one the films biggest strengths that Durand is played by none other than JCVD himself. Van Damme has quietly been building a reputation as an underrated actor this past decade, from his sarcastic villain of 'The Expendables 2' to the mysterious, Colonel Kurtz figure of the last 'Universal Soldier' movie, but here he really steals the show. He's clearly having a lot of fun playing a wise old bad ass; you wind up believing that he'd be the type of mentor to get kids to throw coconuts at his student for fun, or throw them into a surprise bar fight to test their skills. Additionally, despite being in his fifties, Van Damme can still throw down. He gets in several brawls of his own during the run time and looks like he could take on Tong-Po himself.Alain Moussi meanwhile is likeable enough as the lead, but he's here for one thing and one thing only; spinning through the air and kicking people in the head. He gets in several impressive scraps but the film saves the best to last. His climactic three-round fight with Tong-Po is to put it mildly, awesome. Surrounded by a baying, blood-thirsty crowd, the two engage in a violent and extremely painful looking fight. Claret flies, glass gets taped to their hands and swords come into play for an epic scrap that lasts for ages and could only be more macho if a Predator turned up. The choreography is top notch and by the end, both guys look like they've been dragged through hell.Like I said though, there are problems. The storytelling relies on an extended flashback, but it's not obvious where it ends and this is a little disorientating. Gina Carano's casting as an unscrupulous fight promoter is odd too. She's perfectly capable of handling the role, but seeing a highly regarded pro-fighter in a movie like this and doing no fighting is jarring, plus it hints that George St. Pierres' role as a booze-loving, penniless fighter will be a significant secondary character, but he doesn't really do much. Either it wasn't fully thought out or half his scenes wound up on the cutting room floor.Not perfect then, but as it clocks in at a brisk ninety minutes and features one utterly jaw-dropping smackdown as a finale, 'Kickboxer: Vengeance' is definitely worth a watch. The plot is cliched, but the lead is a nice lad, the villain is an intimidating monster and Van Damme is having a whale of a time. This remake works."
" FANTASTIC!!
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,10,This is fantastic!!! Dave Bautista as Tong Po was amazing!!! This is better than the original!!!
" reboot of the classic kickboxer
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it gives a more up to date twist on the original story of Kickboxer. The direction and screenplay are both really good. The casting and acting are really good especially by Jean-Claude van Damme as Master Durand and Dave Bautista as Tong Po. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Everyone knows what kind of movie is it
",2018-09-08 00:00:00,10,Exactly what I expected. Fantastic fights. Great for entertainment.
" A refreshing delight of a disappearing Genre
",2018-05-25 00:00:00,8,"WHILE THE MOVIE MIGHT NOT GIVE AS MUCH AS AN IMPACT AS THE ORIGINAL, I FOUND MYSELF WATCHING THIS NEW VERSION IN DELIGHT. Alain Moussi shows his talent and lives up to his Martial prowess. JCVD playing the new mentor is also a delight, although doesn't give the same feel as the original's local Master. I agree to this change because it has already been done. Dave Bautista plays Tong Po and offers a new and physically tougher version of a once feared enemy fighter.
All in all this movie is a refreshing view to a genre that is slowly disappearing from the world of Cinema.
But I will always welcome this Genre back as it shows the viewers the importance of training, improving, working and learning. All these which is sorely lacking in todays Movies."

" It's Kickboxer
",2018-05-05 00:00:00,7,"Its Kickboxer what did you come into this movie thinking? The first one was cheesy what did you expect from this one? This movie is all you remember the original being, pure awesomeness entertainment with some great action who cares about dialogue plot twist and all that other crap people write in reviews to sound like they know something."
" Bad movie, but watchable for the right reasons
",2018-01-25 00:00:00,5,"The movie is pretty bad. The story, acting, (lack of) development, etc. But this is the kind of ""you get what you pay for"" bad. You watch this movie probably because you grew up with Van Damme's first movies, and remember Tong Po as one of the first movie antagonists that actually gave you nightmares.None of that charm is here. Van Damme is without inspiration and makes you wonder why people ever thought he was a dominant or flashy fighter. The charm is in the new Kurt Sloan, played by Alain Moussi. Not that he is a good actor, but he has a boyish charm, combined with true martial arts skills. The actual surprise however came in 2 forms. (1) Tong Po played by Bautista. That guy is for real, nuff said. And (2) the many cameos by todays real fighters who can be recognized if you're a fan of Glory Kickboxing and UFC.Watch this movie like you would watch a remake of Mortal Kombat, or a remake of the Turtles. Therefor this is an acceptable remake of the original Kickboxer with a few nice worthy moments. Just don't expect anything from Van Damme, because those one or two slow kicks aren't worth staying awake for."
" To those who are complaining
",2017-05-11 00:00:00,10,"Sure the times have changed and improvising is needed. So you have a slightly different movie than the original ? Whats the big deal guys ? You would go watch Hunger games and all other shitty movies but wouldn't like this one because its a little different than the original kickboxer ? The only thing i would say that i didn't like about the movie which doesn't even matter that much is the Elephant were fake but i am glad they were and didn't freak out the animals for a silly movie scene. And for that i would like to Thank the creator of this movie for caring about the animal intentionally or non intentionally.All in all, huge fan of VD and Batista so i enjoyed the movie."
" Interesting and very watchable but not stellar
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,8,"It is not a bad movie in the sense of the whole meaning. But I would have preferred to see a guy like Scott Adkins having the main role. The choreography and the story line are fine but the problem with Alain Moussi is that when fighting Bautista , he doesn't give the will to use full force. Van Damme saves the goods by his fighting scenes with Moussi. The fight scenes between Bautista an Moussi are well choreographed.Watchable and enjoyable but not on par with the original"
" Reimagening
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,4,"Ah well, once the student now the teacher. And it seems that JCVD is doing the transition with ease. Not so easy is our main actor here. Well unless you're saying he's easy pray for Bautistas character. But Bautista, who has proved to be phenomenal in Guardians of the Galaxy, does not have much to do here, apart from looking mean and fighting from time to time (in such a fashion that he does seem unbeatable).Then you have Gina C. who is so underused it hurts as much as if she threw a punch in your face. At least then you'd know why you hurt though ... Seriously though, there are many things that are wrong with this movie, but if you came here to see people fight, there's been worse movies. The choreography may not be top notch, but it does fulfill all the requirements. We also get a female police something (she's investigating and stuff) as a love interest, who probably wonders why she took acting lessons ... anyway easy on the eyes and really not challenging (no pun intended), with very predictable turns ... (if IMDb is correct a sequel is supposed to come out in 2017 ... you can't wait either, right?)"
