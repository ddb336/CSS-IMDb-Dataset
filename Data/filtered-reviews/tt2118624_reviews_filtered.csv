" Meta-Murder
",2021-04-09 00:00:00,8,"The Final Girls: Very much satire and a deconstruction of the teen slasher film tropes. Nevertheless the violence and horror is very real even when leavened with dark humour. Max is a teen girl whose late mother Amanda was a Scream Queen in the 1986 slasher film Camp Bloodbath. Amanda was only remembered for that role finding it difficult to get serious work. Max is persuaded to attend a special screening of Camp Bloodbath and through a set o bizarre circumstances is catapulted into the movie along with her friends. They have to battle not just the crazed killer, Billy, but also the caricature characters of the others who inhabit the film world. Dumb sexist males as well as airhead blondes. The power of The Final Girl who can slay the Slasher is explored. This Archetype is more powerful the chaotic slayer. An entertaining film with plenty of laughs but sometimes the laugh will die in your throat as heads are chopped off. Directed by Todd Strauss-Schulson from a screenplay by M. A. Forlin and Joshua John Miller. On Netflix. 8/10."
" This film is a con
",2021-04-03 00:00:00,1,"What this film does very well is make you think youre watching something unique by parodying friday the 13th. In fact what it does is remake friday the 13th and adds one variation, the characters are self aware they are in a movie.... so in essence you are watching friday the 13th. This film is not a 1 but it is also not a 6.6 so it must be punished.Save your time."
" Better than most!
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,7,Wasn't expecting much but got a pleasant surprise. Original and watchable!
" A perfect, meta, horror comedy
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,10,"This is a great film if you like horror comedies. As funny as it is compelling. A very original story, with scares, a goofy mystery at the center of a comedy, teen-slasher, that pulls at your heart strings exactly when you need it to. This is a good laugh. I would watch it again and again. I highly recommend it."
" UNDERRATED
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,9,I did not expect this film to be what it was. I am not a fan of horror films but I love comedy. I like Adam Devine and his aura and I like Tessa's history as well. The movie was completely hilarious and unexpected. I think I had a smile on my face the entire time (except for the necessary heartfelt scenes). Alia Shawkat is an underrated actress and needs more leading roles. Great film I could watch twice a day.
" Not that scary, not that funny
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,4,"I am a fan of horror movies that don't take itself too seriously and tend towards the comedy genre. Braindead, Shaun of the dead, black sheep, reanimator, cabin in the woods and even killer tomatoes all great. This movie was just meh. Not scary, not gross, no laughing out loud moments and just a couple of ha's. Perhaps it is more funny to film geeks or people working in the film industry due to references to genre cliches. However I am not one of them. I must admit the movie is pleasant to the eye with nice lighting effects and nice colour grading."
" Better then I expected!
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,7,I think this was a really cool take on classic slasher films!
" Not what anyone expected
",2020-12-09 00:00:00,10,As I read the reviews it dawned on me how many people missed the true point of this movie. It's a drama about loss and acceptance hidden in a teen horror comedy that pays homage to 80s slasher films. That's what makes this movie work. The dynamic chemistry between Max and her mom and how it changes and evolves really brings it home.
" Could have been better
",2020-12-08 00:00:00,6,"I've never heard of this movie till I saw it on Hulu this month. I love a good horror comedy, so I gave it go. However, it was a little disappointing to watch. Because of the PG-13 rating, they can't show any of the 'staples' of a teen slasher flick, like the nudity and gore. I think they could have kept in PG-13 if they at least alluded to those scenes properly. Perhaps a sex scene starts as the camera tilts away to look at them in shock as the killer is closing in. There are also a lot of pacing issues. The movie starts out strong, but there a lot of lulls in between action-packed scenes that drag the pace down to a crawl. Which would be fine.....if this was a horror-drama. But it's supposed to be a comedy. Where's the comedy? The other main drawback is that the main character that we are supposed to be rooting for is a mary-sue. I think you could replace Max with a robot and the robot would have a better personality. The whole point of the 'final girl' is that she's supposed to be the most interesting and complex character. They are supposed to know the games of the villain and be able to outsmart and battle them. Also....they are the 'final' girl for a reason. I'm looking at you, random love interest that somehow lives in the end.... Honestly, if you're looking for a pg/pg-13 love letter to teen slasher flicks, literally just watch the Hook, Line, and Screamer episode of Total Drama Island. Better yet, watch Tucker and Dale or The Cabin in the Woods."
" Unique and fun
",2020-12-06 00:00:00,7,Taissa farmiga shows how talented she is. Also very well written and unique story line. I was very surprised how well done this film was.
" Incredible Parody Of The Horror Films !!
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,9,"The way that this movie makes me cry is insane, The acting is so perfect and the cast are funny and talented, there's such an emotional scenes in it, absolutely the greatest horror/comedy of all time period! every horror movies fan should watch it."
" Great blend of a spoof and a homage.
",2020-10-22 00:00:00,8,"When you have such a fascinating premise it is rather hard not to get interested and excited, but often times the execution of said premise proves
to be abysmal and therefore ruin what could have been a fantastic opportunity. While I don't feel that's the case for The Final Girls, the effort is not met without flaws. The mixture of horror and comedy is an extremely difficult blend to successfully pull it off, and to not fall into a place of ""is funny
because of how bad it is"" which tons of films have sadly come down to. The good thing about the Final Girls is how cleverly it tackles that notion by
primarily being a satire, a spoof on 80s horror clich√©s, most notably those coming from the slasher subgenre.The main characters find themselves in a movie theater where there is a homage to a very popular 80s horror flick, called Camp Bloodbath, which stars Max's (Taissa Farmiga) late mother (Malin Akerman), who was an actress mainly known for her role in that film. Having passed only three years since a car accident that tragically took her mom's life, Max is conflicted about watching her deceased mother in a film where she gets killed by a masked maniac. The emotional element is present to provide a bigger depth to the story, which works quite well in my opinion. After a weird incident in the movie theater, a fire starts spreading and amidst the chaos, she grabs a machete and opens her and her friends' way through the movie screen, and that is how they get sucked into the Camp Bloodbath film. Having in their group a guy who is a huge fan of the movie proves to be really helpful as he knows what needs to be done to get out of the film's universe.The Final Girls manages to poke fun and pay homage at the same time, and does it with an adequate level of silliness, it doesn't feel over-the-top by any means. It's a well-balanced tone that makes this film all-around enjoyable although I believe that the PG-13 rating did hurt it quite a bit, if it had been rated R, it could have been explosive, so that's the only thing that's lacking in my opinion.I highly recommend it, you'll definitely have fun!"
" Charming Slasher Spoof
",2020-10-20 00:00:00,8,"A young woman and her friends get pulled into the slasher movie her late mother starred in and they have to battle a psychotic killer, some really stupid camp counselors, and make peace with her dead mother.The Final Girls might have been better if it was rated R and could really embrace all the slasher tropes, but it's an uncommonly sweet and thoughtful film about friendship and the relationships we have with our parents. Just try to listen to ""Bette Davis Eyes"" after seeing this movie and not burst into uncontrollable tears."
" Smart with just enough camp
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,8,"I really liked the concept of this movie, but something fell short for me in the execution. I just wished it had a higher ridiculousness threshold, like MORE CAMP, or had been slightly less campy like Scream but it was one step out of sync from being amazing for me! Still worth a watch for the laughs and the concept!"
" Final final final girls
",2020-10-18 00:00:00,8,"A fun premise... entertaining performances (in a campy way), fun and cheesy takes on '80s slasher film culture. But perhaps the biggest surprise was the mother-daughter story, which was at the heart of the whole movie and really nicely played. I was surprised to get choked up a little bit, even. Definitely not what I expected, but it gave this film some weight that made it a probably a much better film than it otherwise would have been. I enjoyed it a lot."
" Semi-Final Girls
",2020-10-15 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed how ""The Final Girls"" kept true to the slasher genre religiously and yet was able to keep the formula fresh and original with it's narrative twist. Sure they played up the stereotypes, but it was so fun. The acting in the is just the right level of cheesy without going too far and being silly to watch. It is nostalgic and modern with the perfect balance of jumps, gore and laughs, but falls short of keeping true to what the movie spoofs."
" Worth it for Akerman's performance alone (but fun otherwise, too)!
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,8,"So unlike most reviewers here, I'm *not* a huge fan of 80's slasher films (I've seen a few I liked, but overall I prefer creepy gothic horror to slasher-type horror), and while I very much enjoyed The Cabin in the Woods's concept and story, the sheer ugly nihilism of the ending ruined that film for me. So when this came on cable one night, I didn't even plan to watch the whole thing, much less to get sucked in and enjoy it as much as I did.But I did. I did get sucked in right from the beginning, aided by the film's opening ten minutes or so and the knowledge (which I learned when I looked up the movie online) that it was written by the son of Jason Miller (Father Karras in The Exorcist) in part as a tribute to his late father. I thought that was touching and interesting, and the delightful cast and unique set-up of this film made me decide to ""just give it a few more minutes.""Those ""few more minutes"" ended with me watching the whole movie, thoroughly enjoying myself as the jokes and references crossed my screen...and then with me literally crying, sobbing, when the film reached its emotional climax.I cannot say enough about Malin Akerman's performance here. Through the whole movie she has a tough line to walk, portraying an innocent young girl who is also (through the magic of film) a mother forever separated from the daughter she loves. Perhaps it is because I am myself the mother of two daughters; perhaps I was simply a little extra emotional that night. I do not know. All I know is that I cried. Hard. Watching Akerman's face as ""Bette Davis Eyes"" plays (I'm trying to avoid spoilers here), the way it shifts from happy and reassuring to, for the briefest moment, terror, then to resolution, courage, and happy reassurance again just broke me. I have always liked Akerman, but never saw such depths in her work before. She deserves recognition for it, because she reached right into my chest and squeezed my heart, hard.All of the performances in this film are excellent, in fact. There are a number of surprisingly deep and subtle moments for a slasher film, and a number of laughs--perhaps not minutes-long belly laughs, but I was amused and at least chuckled a number of times. The flashbacks were especially clever, I thought, and yes, while I (as a child of the 70s/80s) knew that ""Cherry Pie"" was anachronistic, the scene and moment were so fun that I didn't care. I'd imagine someone who's seen lots of 80's slashers would find even more in-jokes and references than I did. The cast overall is charming, and appear to be having so much fun that you can't help but have fun, too.It's an entertaining film with a surprisingly emotional heart, and the performances (again, especially Akerman) are excellent. You could do worse than adding this to your Halloween horror list--but have some Kleenex handy, just in case.(For any others reading this who aren't big fans of slashers, I also recommend ""Happy Death Day,"" another ""slasher"" type movie with an interesting twist, a lot of humor, and delightful performances.)"
" Cute and silly but nothing special
",2020-09-27 00:00:00,6,"Honestly, I was hoping this to be way funnier than it was but I was surprised by the mother/daughter storyline which was kind of cute but then it culminated into this seizure-causing scene that lasted for way too long. Right when I was thinking to myself that the cinematography in this movie was so good they start flashing those ""lightnings"" in your face for like 10 mins and you go blind. It was literally painful to watch. Otherwise it does keep you on your toes and it's got a few funny moments but nothing super hilarious. You won't be LMFAO-ing when watching this but it's still worth the watch."
" Meta comedy/horror valentine to '80s slasher flicks gets all the deep cuts right.
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,8,"THE FINAL GIRLS (2015) *** Taissa Farmiga, Malin Akerman, Alexander Ludwig, Nina Dobrev, Alia Shawkat, Thomas Middledtich, Adam Devine, Angela Trimbur, Chloe Bridges, Tory N. Thompson, Reg Rob, Lauren Gros, Daniel Norris. Meta comedy horror flick that's a valentine to '80s slasher flicks with Farmiga as a young woman still grieving the death of her actress mother Akerman who attends a horror film double feature where she and her friends are literally thrown into the movie unspooling allowing her to intermingle with her late parent while attempting to save her from the masked madman offing the cast in the process. Director Todd Strauss-Schulson gets all the right moves down pact with classic horror tropes and its SCREAM-inspired screenplay by M.A. Fortin and Joshua John Miller crams just enough violence, sexual overtones and unexpected poignancy in the mix of this fun/scary salute to slasher pics."
" Not worth your time
",2020-08-28 00:00:00,4,The meta aspect of this movie is pretty cool. But the movie itself is boring. The kills are super uncreative and bloodless for the most part. The story is also a bit too dramatic for my liking. I dont really get all these 8 out of 10's...
" They won't be singing Kumbaya... they'll be screaming Kumba-no!
",2020-08-26 00:00:00,7,"Grieving the loss of her mother Amanda Cartwright (Malin Akerman), a one-time horror scream queen, young girl Max Cartwright (Taissa Farmiga) is thrown into the film that made her mother famous, the 80's slasher flick, ""Camp Bloodbath"". Very a-kin to ""Friday the 13th"", a slasher/serial kill is on the loose murdering the kids. Billy Murphy (Daniel Norris) was teased to death by the camp mates and wants his bloody revenge. Max and her friends (Alia Shawkat, Alexander Ludwig, Thomas Middleditch and Nina Dobrev) must work with the camp mates to try and survive.I was dubious about this film when I read the summary. Not only was it littered with 'kids', it was also on a cable channel which is not known for quality films. I watched it all the same and was pleasantly surprised at it. It is a weird re-hash, parody, and homage all in one. It was like ""Scream"" (1996) the way it knew it's content, crossed with ""The Last Action Hero"" (1993) the way it poked fun at itself, and ""Cabin in the Woods"" (2011) the way it developed - but just a little cuter, colourful and fluffier. It does not take itself too seriously, nor the genre that it is working with, nor the era that the 'original' movie was set in. There are times where it is cheesy and camp, there are times where it looks cheap - but all in all it works. Plenty of clich√©s and standard slasher tropes but used well to get the plot across rather than thrown in just to use them. I would not necessarily say that this film is scary, more an adventure film set in a horror film. I imagine it's kind of like what would happen if the current MTV generation took a virtual tour of an 80's slasher/horror film. There is nothing too offensive, plenty of suggestion rather than action, a little bit of bad language, very mild drink and drugs use, nudity and some violence and gore (but used as much in comedy as in horror).While this film was pleasantly surprising and nice, it's the kind of film I could most of the family in front of, whereas, personally, I prefer the kind of films you can't safely put family members in front of for fear of offending them. Give me ""Friday the 13th"" (1980), ""The Burning"" (1981), ""Sleepaway Camp"" (1983), or even ""Cheerleader Camp"" (1988). But still, this was a lighthearted way to reminisce, it was fun, and at 91 mins it was easy to sit through. Released in 2015 with a relatively low budget of $4.5 million, I am sure you will catch this film repeated on cable channels in the future, so I say, why not give it a go.

" ""Bang Bang, You're Dead""
",2020-08-07 00:00:00,6,"Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend, especially for slasher fans.As soon as I saw ""trapped in a movie"", I was sold. I'm a big fan of survivalist situations (realistic or not), and have been waiting to find a ""trapped in a movie"", as opposed to ""trapped in a video game"" for some time now.While my expectations were a bit high, I think the cast helped even me out some. This has some highly recognizable cast for 2015:
Thomas Middleditch ""Silicone Valley""
Malin Akerman ""Watchmen""
Adam Devine ""Pitch Perfect""
Alia Shawkat ""Arrested Development""
Chloe Bridges ""Pretty Little Liars""Most of which I'm not actually a big fan, but Taissa Farmiga ended up carrying most of the movie anyways.Given that they're trapped in a slasher movie, we have to deal with several cliches, and SO MUCH meta discussion that is literally takes over the movie at certain point, but that is part of the survival strategies. We also get some pretty interesting death scenes, along with some that are more comedic than interesting.Surprisingly, the movie is actually both too formulaic and unique to discuss much without spoilers, so I'll just say any slasher fan that enjoys discussion about slasher movies is going to like this one."
" Crafty slasher horror meta homage/send-up
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,8,"Max Cartwright (a fine and appealing portrayal by Taissa Farmiga) and her friends attend a revival theater screening of the cheesy 80's slasher flick ""Camp Bloodbath."" Max and her friends all must fight for their lives after they are mysteriously sucked into the events happening in the movieDirector Todd Strauss-Schulson keeps the ingenious and engrossing story moving along at a brisk pace, maintains an engaging tongue-in-cheek tone throughout, and displays a true wholehearted love for corny body count fare. The clever script by M.A. Fortin and Joshua John Miller pokes wickedly witty fun at various tried'n'true slice'n'dice tropes that include gnarly 80's slang, the inevitable have sex and die cliche, dumb cardboard characters, and a seemingly unstoppable and indestructible killer (hulking Daniel Norris). (Alas, this film does punk out on both the graphic gore and gratuitous female nudity, both of which were key ingredients in 80's slasher flicks.) Better still, there are even several touching scenes between Max and her deceased actress mother Amanda (a luminous performance by Malin Akerman), who plays sweet shy girl Nancy in ""Camp Bloodbath.""Moreover, it's acted with zest by an enthusiastic cast: Alexander Ludwig as amiable hunk Chris Briggs, Nina Dobrev as the snarky Vicki Summers, Alia Shawkat as the brash Gertie Michaels, Thomas Middleditch as the nerdy Duncan, Adam Devine as crude horndog Kurt, and Angela Trimbur as the ditsy Tina. The surprise ending is a total pip. The spirited shivery synthesizer score by Eddy Zak and Gregory James Jenkins hits the spot-on shuddery spot. An absolute treat for fans of knife-kill horror fare."
" Restrained yet effective takedown of the slasher genre
",2020-06-25 00:00:00,8,"Important side note: This is NOT to be confused with the movie Final Girl which came out the same year as The Final Girls and shares a male lead actor. Very weird.The fabric of reality itself is toyed with when a group of movie nerds are sucked into a famous slasher movie. Their struggle to both escape the film in which they are trapped and to understand the rules by which they must follow to progress is actually a secondary plot-line to a surprisingly emotional core. Our lead character, Max, is in a personal hell as her late mother was the lead actress in the movie in which she and her friends are trapped. Not only must she escape, but she has to watch a younger version of her mother playing a different character attempt to escape the psycho-camp-killer as well.This all sounds kind of traumatic, but in practice it walks a fine line between hilarious and touching. As it is a send-up of the slasher genre, expect a lot of humor specifically tailored to those who've seen a good many slasher movies. Our hero and her mother are the most fleshed out of the characters and, while their bond is very skillfully handled, we never learn much about them or the rest of the characters to be honest. The acting is generally pretty good, the actors gamely embracing stereotypes of stereotypes for comedic value. Some of the actors embrace the silliness a bit too hard, pushing their performances from hilarity to unintentionally cringeworthy-levels, but these instances are few and far between.While the characters may be a bit stale, the story is anything but. While a similar movie, Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon, opted to make light of the genre by inserting slasher tropes into the real world, Final Girls sidesteps reality entirely. Pulling the real world characters into a movie world allows the story to explore the comedic side of slashers in a whole new way entirely. What might be stale and frustrating in non-comedies, flashbacks, voice-overs, characters with no depth, etc, becomes a playground for inventive new ideas in The Final Girls. It establishes firm rules in which its world operates, then plays by those rules to great effect. It manages to both effectively mock slashers while creating something completely distinct for itself!This imaginative elbow-to-the-ribs-satire vibe is only dampened by the films refusal to go for the throat. Slashers are known for their excesses, a balance between stupid raunch and blunt morality tale. The Final Girls wants to have it both ways, it tries to pay homage to the slasher as a concept, yet stays safely within the confines of a very conservative PG-13. As I personally am not a fan of the slasher genre in general due to its excesses, I found the restraint in The Final Girls to be right up my alley; however there are moments where the film feels chained up. The choice to hold back in key areas feels made in a boardroom. Some of the restraint doesn't feel natural, despite my personal appreciation of that choice.Overall, if a horror-comedy send up of the slasher genre with a faint Back to the Future vibe mixed with original and unexpected ideas in a PG13 package sounds fun, you're in for a treat with The Final Girls! Honestly, this movie has something that'll appeal to most viewers. The only people I can think of who might not like this one are people who've never liked fright films in any capacity.-Josh Evans"
" Neat idea, until they change the idea...
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,5,"I'm all for movies that go meta, in fact many of the horror films I actually enjoy are those that take a knowing look at the inherent flaws in the genre. The Final Girls is a unique one because it cranks the self-referential nature up to a level where the characters might as well be winking directly at the camera. The mere idea of real-life people walking into a movie is something that's been done before, but I think it is a cool way of looking at the stark contrast between reality and the movies. I enjoyed this aspect of the film, and definitely got some chuckles out of the way they handled some of the goofy things we all know from other horror films. I got the impression that Camp Bloodbath was most closely mimicking Friday the 13th, which is one of the classic horror films I haven't seen. As a result, there's a chance I missed some of the references, but I still felt like I was ""in on the joke."" It's not so specific to that one film that it alienates all people who aren't fans of it.I think where The Final Girls falls short is that it kind of loses track of what it wants to be. At first I was all-in on the idea that these kids were going to be first-hand observers of Camp Bloodbath, who had to watch but could do nothing to stop it, yet they'd have one of their group who desperately wants to deviate from the script. However, they turn away from that idea and make the kids part of the movie themselves, now having to deal with the fact that they might have changed things beyond repair. This was also an intriguing idea, because it felt like they could take a wiser path to fixing their fate, since they had some knowledge of how horror movies work. Then the movie kind of devolved and became more of a traditional horror film, and took away most of the cooler twists they established up to that point. The Final Girls is a movie that needed a bit more thought and perhaps a couple more drafts of the script to elevate it from something that is decent to something that could be really good or even great."
" Missed the mark
",2020-06-13 00:00:00,5,"I was intrigued when I came across this flick and read the synopsis of it so I thought I'd give it a rip. Great idea. Kind of Back to the future-ish in a way. But alas, it quickly went off the rails. Even if you suspend disbelief, nothing makes sense. The acting is so-so. Set design is ok, nothing special. CGI was decent. It was supposed to be set in a 1986 slasher film but characters from that time period made 21st century references and jokes. Costumes didn't reflect 86 or hair styles for that matter. I also pegged the ""twist"" ending which I hate doing. On a positive note it's worth a shot if nothing else is on. I stayed with it from about 10 minutes in to the end."
" I was going to give it a 7 but the ending won me over
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,8,Lots of wonderful reviews here to read and I'll just add my two cents briefly.I am not really a horror fan and was not greatly impressed until near the ending. It was so surprising and artfully done and chock full of surprises it won me over.A definite 8!
" A bit of Pleasantville, some Scream, and some Last Action Hero for kick.
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,8,"The Final Girls is very humorous horror comedy that although it shys away too much for the edgier subject matter(PG-13 and all), it does manage to work due to it's humor, it's cast, and a very sweet mother/daughter story. Max Cartwright still grieving over her recently deceased 80's scream queen mother Amanda is talked into attending a revival of her mother's iconic slasher film Camp Bloodbath. However a fire erupts in the theater and through magic I guess, Amanda and friends find themselves inside the movie complete with exaggerated slasher movie cannon fodder. The movie has fun with modern day teens interacting with 80's horror movie caricatures including casual sexism and homophobia dropped by the dumb jock stereotype and the portrait portrayed here isn't too far from the one used in Pleasantville. Sam has some absolutely heart wrenching moments interacting with the character played by her mother and it's that emotional core that elevates this beyond a spoof movie. To say anything more would be to give too much away, so go see it. But be advised this is first and foremost 80% comedy maybe 20% horror. It's not played the same way as Tucker & Dale vs. Evil or Cabin in the Woods so judge it on its own merits and you'll find something special."
" Was Hoping to agree with the ""brilliant"" reviews
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,4,Well I was hoping I'd agree with all the people who said it brilliant but I must agree with those that said it could've been better. It was a really fun concept and it was even okay with how they ended up in the movie but once there it started to go to crap. People compared it to Cabin in the Woods but what I think it was going for was more along the lines of Tucker & Dale vs Evil. The film was focused on satiring slasher flicks but in particular obviously Friday the 13th. Taissa Farmiga desperately needed to be recast. She clearly is an actress better suited for drama. She just looked sad the whole movie. It's like trying to cast Rooney Mara in a comedy. Not gonna work. All and all it just did not touch on nearly enough Friday the 13th type cliches such as over the top kills and it mixed in too much drama to be an effective satire. To eliminate some of the drama I think her mom should have died when she was younger so that she wasn't so attached. A for effort though.
" as a concepti is great? the execution? not that much.
",2020-05-07 00:00:00,5,"I love slashers. i really do. they're by far my favourite horror genre. i think they are fun as hell if they're well made. i remember the first time i saw scream and became addicted to the film it is still one of my favourite movies of all time. a meta-slasher spoof? all in! the film even starts ok (not great because the characters are presented in a very superficial way, without much time for us to get along well with them), but when they enter in the movie i'm still in.the main problem is the tension. it doesn't exist. the movie doesn't know how to create tension and fear, how to buld up the atmosphere for us to care about the characters or the main villain. it doesn't know either if it wants to be just a comedy or an horror film. it's like the movie chose a limbo to exist without not compromising with neither. why? i don't know. the problem is: if they wanted to have a slasher they needed more horror. if they wanted more of a comedy they needed to be more meta - to play with the slasher rules like scream did: they tried but just in an extreme superficial way. ""you might be the killer ""did the meta thing"" better even though it has also the problem of we not caring about the characters.don't get me wrong i understand why some people enjoyed a lot of this: it's cool to see the rules subverted, the film is immaginative i liked the cinematography. the concept is the best part: it's awesome, it's a great idea. some of the campy lines in the original movie are fun for being so lame. the problem is that the protagonists should be more aware and critic about what they're seeing. like it is it seems more as a pilot tv show or something.mostly because the idea is good i don't give a lower grade. also because i enjoy alia shawkat and thomas middletich, (and the actors in general are fine, that's not the problem). but to analyse the movie without the geniality of the concept it feels really short. not much scary. not much funny. not much tense. and not much emotional, even though the film tries."
" Fun and witty
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,8,It is hard to get the horror/comedy right but this movie shows love when it makes fun at the 80-slasher genre. I really hope for a sequel!!
" A Very Creative Horror Satire That Is A Lot Of Fun, And Even Very Touching
",2020-03-19 00:00:00,10,"This film is a horror movie parody about a bunch of people who get sucked into a horror movie. They then have to choose whether to play along with the movie or try to intervene. Of course there is a lot of intelligent observational humor about these types of movies (slasher). And the film is really well done, very creative, very aesthetically appealing, funny, and just all around a lot of fun to watch. What I didn't expect was for it to get so emotional and touching towards the end. This went far above and beyond expectations. I highly recommend it."
" Not just a horror movie
",2020-03-03 00:00:00,9,The PG 13 rating may be a negative for some but considering the reclassification of many older horrors to PG 13 it is less of an issue for me. It does a great job with that rating and less than a tenth of a horror blockbuster's budget. The concept is original and although the effects aren't always top notch I can forgive that for the great heartwarming story. This needs a sequel so bad!
" Ki ki ki kind of surprisingly funny
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,6,"""The Final Girls"" is a 2015 horror comedy directed by Todd Strauss-Schulsson starring Taissa Farmiga and Malin Ackerman. The sub-genre of slasher films is one of the most popular among horror fans and especially teenagers. While they seem to all follow the same plot pattern, there are some titles that still stand out and are still being watched today. From Leatherface, over Michael Myers to Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorheese, they all brought up famous movie monsters that are now icons of the new age of horror. Of course the success of one sparked a number of copycat or sequels to be produced, but that's the principal of the genre. Trashy sequels were inevitable. All of them are full of clich√©s and stereotypes, that's why you either love it or hate it. Embrace the cheesyness or watch something else. In my personal opinion, the films range from masterpieces to absolute trash.
While ""Halloween"" ranks among my favourite films of all time, ""Friday The 13th"" is one of dumbest films I've ever seen. So, I when I coincidentally watched the trailer for this mockery, I was pleased that I found a comedy that also realized the hilariousness behind the 1980 slasher. The idea behind this flick might originated from a absurd concept, but was an idea absolutely needed in the genre. It's an absolutely colorful fun flick that piece by piece mocks the clich√©s and stereotypes of a slasher film. Centered around a group of friends who were miraculously sucked into the most obvious rip off of the Crystal Lake saga, the madness begins to develop more and more. To be honest, the characters, especially Farmiga's Max were surprisingly highly sympathic and it was a great fun to watch them trying to survive on screen. Their acting was decent in the concept of a b-movie and I couldn't stop laughing at the performances of the movie cast. The acting is absolutely terrible, but it's so funny, because it's absolutely intentional. Adam Devine might be the peak of it and I'm still wondering why he was the funniest in the bloopers. The film is aware of it's cheap nature and doesn't try to reach anything higher and that's it's biggest advantage. From black and white flashbacks to terrible dialogue it offers all of it. It's just surprising that the film relinquishes the depictions of explicit nudity and gory violence, as it could have made more jokes on cost of those aspects. If there's one thing that disturbed the pleasure of watching it, then it's the horrible visual effects. Some were even tolerable remembering that it's a low budget film, but that car crash scene stabbed my eyes deeper than any knife used in the film. Another welcome surprise of this film is the interwoven mother-daughter and loss subplot that worked out pretty well thanks to the chemistry between Farmiga and Ackerman. It seriously grabbed me more than expected and gave it a whole dimension to it. All in all, this fun flick is a surprisingly entertaining spoof on the slasher genre that manages to reach its goal, thanks to loveable protagonists, experimental camera work and the eye candy the cinematography is. It's no masterpiece, but it doesn't wann achieve anything else, as it doesn't take itself seriously. That's what makes the film work out. Enjoyable!"
" Unleash the beast
",2020-02-19 00:00:00,9,"The Final Girls takes slasher movie cliches and weaves them into a heartfelt tale of closure, with generous amounts of humor thrown in.Adam Devine delivers the most intentionally cringe-inducing lines, but every character - even those from outside the movie within a movie - gets to spout well-worn staples like 'how are you holding up' whether they realize it or not. The bloopers over the credits shows how much quality material was dropped, which makes the final cut great. It is testament to all involved that they could take such shallow tropes and through timing and delivery turn it into something so meaningful. The makers could fashion a PG-13 movie out of a typically R-rated genre. Even the film's run-time is significant.This movie will draw comparisons with The Cabin in the Woods, particular for its stereotypical main characters. But where Cabin in the Woods is deliberately cruel, The Final Girls delivers finality with kindness."
" Psych Fans, this movie feels like Tuesday the 13th
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,9,"If you like Tuesday the 13th, you'll enjoy this.It's got just the right amount of cheese, IMO. Fun take on a slasher flick. Enjoyed it so much that I watched it twice in in two days."
" Great until the end.
",2020-01-28 00:00:00,7,"This was a great movie that was pretty original. However the ending was kind of bad. I was expecting her to wake up from it all being a dream as it implied ""Nancy"" knew she was Max's mom and was telling Max to let her go in her grieving process. No, all the people who were brutally murdered and blown up magically appeared for a probably terrible sequel that wouldn't make sense. I know people like the unpredictable twists but sometimes they are just stupid."
" Comedy at it's best horror
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,7,Pretty awesome movie that sets a new bar for horror movies that will probably be copied for a long time.
" Don't take serious just enjoy the fun
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,8,"Max lives with her mother who was the star of a 80s horror movie. Max's mother prematurely passes away and in anniversary of the release of the movie a special showing is arranged at the theatre. Max reluctantly attends to see her late mother's film with some friends.
They are transported into the film with the film characters destined to play their part and the extras desperate to survive.
The film has a stellar cast Malin Akerman, Taissa Farmiga, Adam DeVine, Alexander Ludwig and Thomas Middleditch and they carry the fun, full hearted film through the silliness and slasher moments.
The lighting and and lightening scenes at the end of the film are thing of beauty and this is a must see for horror films especially with a big heart."
" A++ Super underrated film...
",2020-01-11 00:00:00,10,"I can't recommend this movie enough...Stylish, creative, inventive, funny, and with some outstanding performances, The Final Girls is an excellent addition to the horror/comedy genre. Very original and unlike the SCREAM movie - all the unique ideas were amazingly creative. Something that gives more of a shout-out to other '80s slashers, not just the summer camp subgenre.I do hope these folks make a sequel, which is promising given the trope ending, which I won't spoil."
" A rare moment when a horror film NEEDS A SEQUEL
",2020-01-05 00:00:00,10,"The Final Girls is a very unique horror flick that stands out against the pact of other bloody wannabes within the horror genre. Mixing both comedy and horror, the film does an excellent job at keeping the audience off their phones and glued to the screen by both making them laugh and tense causing whomever is viewing to yell and urge the characters to avoid getting killed. With obvious nods to 80s slasher films *cough cough Friday the 13th, the film itself is able to maintain a tense emotion, towards the later half of the film, without relying on the gimmicks that gave 80s slasher films their status (ex. bloody gore, nudity). Instead, this film centres most of its attention around the mother and daughter love that befalls the main protagonist as she is given a second chance to reunite with her deceased mother. With both spoofs of what makes up a horror movie (flashbacks, stereotypical horror film characters, a game plan to escape etc.) a blend of an 80s like feel, and an original story plot with some modern influences, this film certainly gives the viewer a positive impression once the credits roll. Not only that but it also does an interesting job on predicting what modern day teenagers would do, act and speak in contrast to people of the same age back in the 80s.Amazing production in terms of lighting and film shots, dialogue and incorporations of vintage throwbacks. In addition to that, the films ending does an excellent job of tying up loose knots efficiently without making the audience confused, disappointed or enraged, while at the same time make those watching beg to see more.All in all DEFINITE RECOMMEND. With its incorporation of humour, this movie is a great pick for people who can't stand your standard bloody, scary or disturbing horror movie."
" Slasher life lessons
",2019-12-03 00:00:00,5,"Hey! Remember when I watched Isn't It Romantic?This is the same director making the same movie, except instead of learning lessons from a romantic comedy, people are learning lessons from a slasher film.After another failed audition, Max Cartwright's mother Amanda (Malin Akerman) worries that she'll only be known for appearing in the 1986 slasher favorite Camp Bloodbath. Sadly, she dies soon after in a car accident.A few years later, at a double feature of the film and its sequel, a fire breaks out and Max (now Taissa Farmiga, the sister of Vera) and her friends escape by slicing the screen with a machete. They then enter the world of Camp Bloodbath, where they must escape Billy Murphy, the twisted serial killer who carries a not unlike Jason Vorhees machete.There's a great cast - Alia Shawkat from Arrested Development is in it, as well as Thomas Middleditch from Silicon Valley and Adam DeVine from Workaholics.Writers M.A. Fortin and Joshua John Miller based the characters in this film on some of their favorite slasher films. Nancy (also played by Akerland) is inspired by Ginny from Friday the 13th Part 2 and her name comes from A Nightmare On Elm Street's Nancy Thompson. And Tina was based on P.J. Soles' character Lynda van der Klok in Halloween and Jodi Draigie's Morgan from The House on Sorority Row.Perhaps even more interesting, Miller wrote this movie to deal with the death of his father Jason Miller, who starred as Father Karras in The Exorcist. And even cooler than that is that Joshua John Miller played Homer in Near Dark, Tim in River's Edge and also showed up in Teen Witch."
" Coulda been better
",2019-11-02 00:00:00,3,I thoroughly enjoy this movie with its dumb plot and meta humor. But this movie has a couple of things that hold it back. It's PG13 rating is annoying. The gore shoulda been over the top. The humor was very rare. Decent though.
" Meta-cuteness
",2019-10-21 00:00:00,7,"Fantastic concept that would have been better served with an R-rating. What's an 80s slasher throwback without the cool and creative deaths?!I was very amused during the entire film and there is some great female representation on screen. However, I thought this could have been funnier and more violent. I actually found the director's other film Isn't It Romantic to be much funnier."
" Surprisingly Good!
",2019-08-26 00:00:00,8,"This movie surprised me so much. I saw a trailer for it recently and it caught my interest but could it live up to the trailer? Yes, it could and did. There's some campy 80's horror stuff going on in this movie but beneath all of that there's the story about a mother and a daughter and it will tug at your heart.If you're a fan of 80's slasher movies...this is a must see!"
" Not What I Expected (In A Good Way)
",2019-07-16 00:00:00,9,"The Final Girls originally appeared to be cut from the same cloth as Cabin in the Woods when I first saw the trailer. To tell you the truth, it looked incredibly silly and not like my cup of tea at all, but after a few friends persuaded me to check it out, I found myself pleasantly surprised by how great it was.A young woman is haunted by the sudden death of her scream queen mother and, to make peace with it, she goes to see one of her mother's most famous slasher flicks with her buddies. While in the theater, there's a weird time loop and she and her friends end up inside of the film on the screen.After they've entered the film, they have to fight off a Jason Voorhees-esque hulking killer with the cast of the film itself and the heroine and her mother get to come to terms with each other.A lot of genre bending movies don't work, but this one is so charming and heartfelt that it's hard to not be moved during a few scenes (I'll never listen to Bette Davis Eyes without sobbing after seeing this movie). I think an R rating might have helped the film feel more like a true slasher film, but it's a minor quibble when the writing and acting are this strong."
" Without rules
",2019-07-13 00:00:00,6,"Let's star in a horror movie. A PG-13 horror movie that is based on slasher films. Well if that sounds a bit toothless, I can assure you that many will look upon it that way. There's almost no blood on display (except for one scene) and there are also other ""major"" ingredients missing. The original plan was to make it an R-rated movie, which did not happen obviously. There are quite a few fun bits of trivia like that in the audio commentary (though according to them only 14 year olds listen to them - another joke in case that wasn't clear).Now up until now that may all have sounded quite harsh, which was not my intention. The movie is good fun, but I wanted to make sure people know what they get themselves into (no pun intended). A CGI crash early on in the movie is quite well done and nice to watch. As are the characters, that are a bit of a parody of whatever went on in the 80s. The actors have a lot of fun and it shows. Still there are too many conveniences and coincidences, an ending that tries to be clever and other things you'll either like or be annoyed by. Try to watch it without thinking too much and you'll have a good time - do not compare it with things like Cabin in the Woods though"
" my notes
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,5,"Cool movie, great concept, very creative. a few funny parts. i enjoyed most of it but overall it was alright (1 viewing)"
" Pretty unentertaining
",2019-05-03 00:00:00,4,"I'm not generally crazy about these ""meta"" parody type flicks that have characters standing outside the tropes of film genre and acknowledging them.
They are usually not any more fun than the genre flicks they're criticizing, and nor are they as intelligent as they want to appear.These movies are usually about as entertaining as watching a ""so-bad-it's-good"" flick with a pretend-intellectual type. Slasher movies are among the most clich√©d film genres. It's not hard at all to point out the tropes of them. Some of the things ""The Final Girls"" makes fun of was already ridiculed, and better, in ""Scream"" almost twenty years before.""The Final Girls"" is about a group of kids who accidentally ""enter"" a slasher movie from the '80s, which couldn't be more based on ""Friday the 13th"" if it tried. They witness the events of the movie unfold right in front of them, and know how it's going to turn out, and how to survive.There is also an unnecessary subplot about the protagonist's mother playing one of the actresses in the film-within-a-film, and her using this weird experience to connect with her.I do love Taissa Farmiga, but I think this one was a dud choice for her."
" For true Slasher fans
",2019-04-28 00:00:00,8,Similiar to Scream this film is a love letter to Slasher films. All fans of the sub-genre will enjoy this film
" Nice idea but falls short
",2019-04-26 00:00:00,4,"Slasher comedy/homage, a film within a film, fantasy and horror combined. Sadly it lacks what makes the things slasher movies so popular, namely gore, sex and nudity. Seemed to me that either they were aiming for a younger audience, or they just didn't have the balls to do it properly. The Jason-like killer here is called Billy Murphy, he wears one of the oddest masks that I've seen in such a movie. And talking of Jason (Friday the 13th), we keep hearing ""k k k"" whenever Billy appears, blatantly ripping off Mr Vorhees. The characters were OK, Adam Devine was funny as the obligatory horny camp counsellor. However he and others were in their 30's when they filmed this (Malin Akerman looked stunning, but playing a sweet, innocent virgin when she was 37, come on, that was stretching it!). There is s lot of mother/daughter sentimentality. fair enough, it's an important part of the movie. But for me it detracted and slowed it down.
Nice idea but just a little too weak for me."
" An '80s slasher movie tribute with heart
",2019-04-24 00:00:00,7,"Caught this on Horror Channel, the home of B movie horror flicks, only reason I watched was because of cast including Taissa Farmiga and Malin √Ökerman, it's a clever re-working of all those '80s slasher movies with an intelligent script and interesting premise, a cut (no pun intended) above the usual fare offered in this genre, comical, nostalgic, and fun in equal measures, well worth a watch"
" Emotion Thriving
",2019-04-07 00:00:00,10,"Out of the dozens of on end horror and slasher movies I've seen, I've never seen one capture emotion so brilliantly. One of the best films I've seen in a while."
" Lots of fun!! Love it!
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,9,Wow!! What a gem! We had such a fun time watching. Excellent film. Perfect blend of fun. It's really everything you want it a movie. Watch it immediately we absolutely love it!

",2019-01-30 00:00:00,3,Such overrated movie... No logic at all. This supposed to be scary or funny? So so bad...
" A surprise of a great movie!
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,9,"I literally laughed and teared up a little. Such a gem! I went in expecting just a comedy about horror movies, but ended up with so much more. Definitely watch this, and stick around after/during the credits, for the outtakes!"
" A wonderful surprise!
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,9,"This movie was great. I went in expecting just a comedy about horror movies. What I got was a gem. There was some emotion, as well as laughs. I literally cried and laughed. Great movie, great ending. I really wish there was a sequel!!!"
" Great movie.
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,8,"I wouldn't say this is underrated, just not seen by enough people. I will admit that it gives off serious vibes as ""chick flick"" at moments, but if you love movies like Friday the 13th and The Burning then you'll really enjoy this. It has a fantastic cast, really clever effects and an awesome ""flashback"" scene that is brilliantly done. Highly recommendable!"
" A clever twist on the classic slasher genre
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,7,"The Final Girls is a clever twist on the classic slasher genre. This movie mixes a satirical comedy with real sentiment in an amusing way. However, I do feel like this film had the potential to better than it is. The plot and the jokes probably would have benefited from a little more time in the creative oven. Still, it's a fun watch for anyone who loves a good horror movie."
" One of the better movies I've seen lately.
",2018-10-20 00:00:00,8,"""The Final Girls"" stars the very appealing Taissa Farmiga (younger sister of Vera F.) as ""Max"", daughter of a veteran actress (Malin Akerman) whose big claim to fame was co-starring in a summer camp slasher called ""Camp Bloodbath"". The mom dies, and Max reluctantly agrees to appear at a memorial screening of the film. Surreal events transpire that result in Max and her friends magically transported into the movie. There, Max becomes obsessed with helping her ""mom"" to survive, while she & her friends convince the characters in this movie-within-the-movie to become proactive.I'd heard good things about this one, and I'm happy to say that it doesn't disappoint. As has been said, it's a meta-slasher, but a rather clever one, and may be one of the most clever movies of its kind since Woody Allens' ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"". It satirizes so much that was common in vintage slashers, from the stock characters to the various tropes. Some genuine humour is derived from the fact that the ""Camp Bloodbath"" characters - who, of course, don't realize that that's what they are - could have been seen in any old 80s body count flick. Adam Devine, in particular, is a riot as obnoxious, sexually obsessed Kurt. And ""horror nerds"" like Duncan (Thomas Middleditch) also come in for ribbing. Overall, ""Camp Bloodbath"" plays like a hilarious parody of ""Friday the 13th"" and other camp themed slashers, complete with a hulking psycho (Daniel Norris) whose presence is announced by ""ki ki ki ma ma ma"" type vocalizations.Best of all, this movie has some real *heart* in addition to its jibes. It has characters with actual rooting interest; you do regret seeing some of them die. And you enjoy their incredible preparations for luring and trapping the monstrous killer.The cast is extremely engaging: Farmiga, Akerman, Alexander Ludwig, Nina Dobrev, Alia Shawkat, Middleditch, Devine, Angela Trimbur (the last is also quite funny in her portrayal of a typical horror movie bimbo).The filmmakers are also to be commended for their visual gimmicks, ex: when the flashbacks occur.For a split second, I was annoyed by the resolution, but after some thought, realized: how COULD it end any other way? There are few movie conventions as ripe for parody as horror movie conventions!Eight out of 10."
" One of the worst?
",2018-09-26 00:00:00,2,"First I must admit I only watched about half of the movie before I had to turn it off, since you will never get back the time spent on watching this ridiculously bad movie. What a nonsense. How can they even a) come up with such a crappy story, and b) decide that ""this is great; let's make this movie!""? It is really not possible to understand. The story is so bad and so not interesting. Most horror (horror/comedy) movies are bad, unfortunately, but this is really one of the worst I have ever seen. The only reason for giving it two stars, is that a couple of the scenes are filmed brilliantly; the rest is for the garbage can."
" Funny but lame!!
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,2,"Another attempt at making something funny and remake of 80s horror culture. No brains or blood or boobs. That's definitely not an 80s version of anything. It's weird the guy(Adam Devine) does a complete nude scene in the film"" Game Over Man"" but there are no boobs in this garbage. This is why films today are no longer putting anything that the movie watchers want. Waste of time!!"
" Amusing slasher parody with heart
",2018-08-18 00:00:00,6,"This is a parody of 80's slasher flicks, especially the Friday the 13th franchise. The story revolves around five teens somehow being translated into a fictitious 1986 slasher movie called ""Camp Bloodbath."" The prematurely deceased mother (Malin Akerman) of the teen heroine (Taissa Farmiga) starred in the movie and she gets to meet her again, albeit as a young woman.While this 2015 film is a throwaway flick it's reasonably entertaining, especially if you're familiar with slasher films. What I like best is that it has heart and you can feel the loving relationship of mother and daughter. It's also nice to see Nina Dobrev again, who's one of the most alluring females in the cast, although she's outshined by curvy Angela Trimbur as airhead Tina.The movie runs 1 hour, 28 minutes and was shot in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, with some stuff done in Los Angeles.GRADE: B-"
" Doesn't take itself too seriously
",2018-08-13 00:00:00,9,"This movie is such a good laugh, it doesnt take itself too seriously and it well worth the watch. Acting is great, music is classic (what's better than Betty Davis Eyes?!) and it has a bit of gore for all you horror lovers."
" An unexpected and very original surprise, absolutely great!!
",2018-07-12 00:00:00,9,"I really had a ball with this one! And I didn't even see it coming, I seriously thought (on reading the cover of the dvd) that it was going to be yet another old-fashioned summer-camp slasher movie. Well, in many ways it was, but with a very special and original twist, and that is an achievement in itself in this pretty worn-out genre. There are two ways you can look at this movie: as a retro horror flick in its own right; or as a persiflage on the genre itself, something like the Scream-series was. In my opinion it succeeded in every aspect. As a horror-flick it had a good pace and was fairly exciting with decent scares and some (but not over the top) gore. And as a persiflage it just kept me laughing and smiling all movie long, it just was SO funny and kept hitting the nails on the heads of all the quintessential and at many times silly aspects of the genre. So kudos for the writers and the director, they did a great job!Traditionally in this kind of movie the actors aren't really heavy-weights, but here most of them are pretty good. Taissa Farmiga as the heroine (""the final girl"") is as endearing as her mother Malin Akerman; love-interest Alexander Ludwig is cute as a puppy; Nina Dobrev is a beauty and a natural actress; and horror-nerd Thomas Middleditch is very funny. And I especially want to mention Adam Devine as the retro jock, he is absolutely hilarious!!Photography and direction are great, there are so many intelligent and original inventions: the over-saturated colours of the movie-in-the-movie, the sudden use of black-and-white, the opening and closing credits that are made physical part of the surroundings, the slow-motion effects, it's all smartly done but never too much in your face or forced, always tongue in cheek.If you want to enjoy an old-fashioned slasher but this time with a really original twist, go for this, you will not be disappointed."
" YOU JUST MESSED WITH THE WRONG VIRGIN
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,8,"Amanda Cartwright (Malin Akerman) played Nancy in ""Camp Blood Bath"" a cult classic with a ""Friday the 13th"" script. She has a daughter Max (Taissa Farmiga) and loves the song ""Bette Davis Eyes."" Amanda dies in a traffic accident and three years later Max is coerced into going to a reunion showing of the film ""Camp Blood Bath."" During the feature Max and five of her friends get sucked into the film and integrate with the original cast which includes Max's deceased mother.The film is a comedy-horror. Taissa Farmiga nails the film. The way her eyes tear up and get glassy during scenes with her mom were actually too good and brought the comedy aspect down. The comedy and horror aspect could have been better. Many parts of the film had a sense of deja vu due to similarity with classic films, something they needed to extend to the entire film, i.e.. ""Scary Movie.""The concept for the film came from co-writer Joshua John Miller, whose dad Jason Miller ( Father Karras) died in the ""Exorcist."" He grew up watching his dad die in a film and wondered what it would be like if he was in the film with him.This is a good film, but seems to have been hyped in hopes of getting a lasting cult status. The writing just wasn't that great.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" Eh....6.5 without Angela Trimbur.
",2018-06-03 00:00:00,5,"Not terrible? Angela trimbur is, however. Honestly one of the worst actresses I've ever witnessed, I'm not exaggerating, watch her and pay attn and it'll blow ur mind how consistently bad she is. Adam whatever his name is didn't seem to fit as the lead. Has some creative stuff in it which is more than I cAn say for 93.72% of movies these days. I would bump this up to a 6.5 if I could bear Angela Trimbur but she seriously ruins whatever I watch when she's in it. I hope they make a movie abdout someone shaving her ridicosuloy overdone eyebrows that she stands behind like having thick eyebrows is some beacon of feminism that actively helps take down the patriarchy."
" A unique, light hearted homage to 80's slashers
",2018-05-19 00:00:00,9,"For me, this is a movie that's just about perfect. There's a good blend of comedy, drama and it's full of surprises. It's a horror movie at heart, but not in a serious way. I love the concept and execution behind it. The acting is great. The actors pull out the right emotions and are very believable in their portrayals of their characters. Taissa Farmiga is especially good as Max and nails the emotional turmoil and struggle she's going through with her performance. The film looks great, the FXs are excellent and it flows at a nice even pace. The song choices they chose are perfect. There isn't much I don't like about the film. The only area it might have felt a bit more genuine in the time period of film it was the lack of Nudity or Gore. Those were staples of that time period. I get it, they were trying to appeal to a larger audience, but it just seems a bit suspect those were two things that were absent. No, it doesn't have to be there to make the film work, but it's also a huge part of that era. Other than that, this film pushes all the right buttons.This currently sits at number 18 on my all-time favorite horror movies list. While it's not a true horror film, it has enough elements that I qualify it as such. A pseudo-horror if you will. If you love 80's slasher fare or horror in general from that decade this one's worth checking out. My Rating: 8.5/10"
" Disappointing
",2018-05-01 00:00:00,2,Interesting premise but it's not intelligent enough to pull it off.
" Hilarious, Fresh, Very Clver And Witty
",2018-04-29 00:00:00,9,"It is not that easy to make a movie which is a decent comedy, even more demanding to make a slashe comedy. The Final Girls did that surpsingly well, veery merrily and wth a certain baravado and gusto. Great casting adds a certain flavor, with Taissa Farniga being the spellbinding lead role, fully growing from a timid girl to a valiant fighter.
What makes the movie really strong is that healthy dose of irony, self-mockery, obvious pun, and a great sense of humor.
Laura Kern of Film Comment called the film a ""sharp, wickedly funny, and unexpectedly heartfelt homage"" to slasher films, adding, ""It's a gimmicky premise, perhaps, but a highly effective one. No mere meta-exercise, the film innovatively blends the worlds of the 1986 teens of Camp Bloodbath with the modern-day ones.""
Not much can be added here."
" Fun homage to old slasher films
",2018-04-25 00:00:00,8,"This retro throwback horror film is a nod to horror films past, much in the way Scream was in the 90s. This one takes it even farther in that the characters are transported to the set of a 1980s horror movie and they are stuck there.... This of course relates to a dramatic character arc for the main character who's movie played a part in this very film. So there's a pretty well-done mother/daughter element to the story. This movie has humor, including parody-type humor, and it has scares but not excessive gore. It really is an homage to the slasher genre. It feels like Friday the 13th meets Ernest Goes to Camp. Original and fresh and fun."
" The Final Girls(2015)
",2018-02-20 00:00:00,8,"Liked it. funny, colorful and kept my attention. Intrigued by the plot how they went into another world. There is always killing i can count on that. The killing didn't gross me out thats why i dont watch movies like SAW or bloody gory movies this was"
" A nice time passer
",2017-11-30 00:00:00,7,"A few years ago, I went to a panel at New York ComicCon all about ""The Final Girls"". The movie hadn't yet debuted but the cast and filmmakers were there to hype the production. I enjoyed the panel but forgot to see the movie...and finally got around to it tonight. And, it turned out to be a decent little film. And, when I say 'little' it's because the film was low-budgeted and seemed to come and go rather quickly. Fortunately, the DVD is available through Netflix and it's worth your time.Before going on, it's important to note that I am talking about ""The Final Girls""...not ""The Final Girl"" from 2010.The story is about a group of five friends who inexplicably get stuck in a bad 1980s slasher film. While they know what's going to happen, they have a heck of a time avoiding death and only a seeming miracle can stop the killing machine, Billy.The film is a combination of comedy and pathos. I wish the film had focused more on comedy but my wife disagreed and liked the mix. Regardless, the film has many clever moments and is a nice sendoff of the genre. Worth seeing. And, it's one of the few films that features outtakes at the end that actually ARE worth seeing."
" ""Not Bad Horror/Slasher Satire!""
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,5,"This 2015 horror comedy stars Taissa Farmiga and Malin Akerman. This tells of teenage girl, Max (Farmiga) who is coping with the loss of her mother, Amanda (Akerman) who died in a car accident 3 years prior. Amanda was an actress and Max attends a screening of a cheesy, 80's horror film, ""Camp Bloodbath"" in which she starred. Soon, a fire breaks out and Max is magically transported into the film with her friends. They find themselves trying to survive against the masked killer along with the characters. In the process, Max bonds with Amanda's character, Nancy who is a camp counselor. This isn't a bad horror/slasher satire that obviously pokes fun of ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Last Action Hero,"" it has humor and heart and Farmiga & Akerman have good chemistry. If you like slasher flicks, check this out at least once."
" Derseves to be a classic
",2017-07-02 00:00:00,8,"The plot follows a young girl grieving at the loss of her mother a former 80's scream queen, so she and her friends go to see the movie she was in and gets sucked into the screen and end up battling the killer themselves along with the stars inside the movie.This movie was a great satire to 80's slasher movies, with tons of tributes and homage's sprinkled throughout, most notably to Jason from Friday The 13th and would definitely highly recommend this to any fans of 80's slashers or just any type of horror in general. The story has a really cool concept with the cast getting sucked into the movie and the two different generations of teens interacting with each other, which was really fun and really boasts some interesting contrasts. Plus there were a surprising amount of emotional scenes in this movie, which made for a nice change and they totally worked, which was thanks to the strong cast of actors which really adds depth to this and made for an unexpected but welcome change.Even by technical stand point this movie has some of the best cinematography that I've seen in a while, with some amazing camera work that you don't usually see in these types of movies. Even the lighting was fantastic which really helps set the mood for the movie, with the mixtures of colours that reflect the situations in each scene, which I thought was interesting and worked really well in the movie's favour. The style of horror mixed with comedy really balances out quite well and you can tell that the cast was having a blast and especially at pointing out the horror movie clich√©s and just running with them.The acting was fantastic with some real strong female leads with Taissa Farmiga who I'd loved on American Horror Story and was equally as great here, she was definitely up to the task and becomes a total bad-ass towards the end and it was nice to see her do something different, definitely a talent to be watched. Malin Ackerman who played her mother was also great their mother daughter relationship really worked well and they had great chemistry together which was the emotional backbone of this movie. Alexander Ludwig was really likable as the boyfriend and male lead. Adam Devine was hilarious and was a definite standout, but wasn't in it long enough. Finally Thomas Middleditch was great as the horror fan boy and made for a great comic relief. In fact the entire cast gave decent and well rounded performances.Although there are a few minor bad points to this though, such as the pacing towards the end was very slow and did kind of sag in places, while I get they were building up suspense for the last act, but it did just go on a bit too long and could have maybe been trimmed down a tad. Plus because of the rating of this movie did feel watered down as we didn't get any gruesome death scenes which for a slasher movie isn't a great thing, and that also meant that none of the death scenes really stood out, but thankfully the movie doesn't suffer too much because of this and it's still an entertaining watch.All in all 'The Final Girls' is a fantastic movie with a great script, strong acting and witty and sharp dialogue and just a general great time. While it may not deliver on the gore, and the emotional scenes may not be for everyone, this movie definitely delivers on everything else and deserves to be a classic."
" Nice take on the 80's slasher
",2017-05-09 00:00:00,7,"Thought this was quite a nice change and different, People go into what is really Friday the 13th, and as they realize whats happening, they try to prevent what they know happens in the movie happening to them Has a good mix of comedy and slashing and will be enjoyable to anyone that likes movies like Friday 13th and Scream"
" You got your Stay Tuned in my Cabin in the Woods
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,9,"OK, so, this isn't the Godfather.It's still a great movie. But, I also like Zombeavers, and Return to Nuke em High, so maybe I am not a ""main stream"" cinephile. The bloopers at the end are also rather chuckle inducing, it's worth sticking around to see.It made me cry, but deliberately, not like other movies that make me sad because of how terrible they are. It made me laugh, also deliberately. It's slasher camp is perfect and it's story is rather interesting. It has a twist, but also lacks the partial nudity I would have preferred (oh the 80's). That does however mean its semi-family friendly."
" A stylish feel-good horror movie
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,8,"Max and her friends are pulled into a an 80's camp horror movie. Stuck inside the movie, Max befriends the character played by her lost mother, fighting off the evil Billy to find the loop out of this slasher flick.This is a charming homage to 80's camp horror in gleaming colors. It features stylish music, lots of one-liners, and characters that are just clich√©d enough to be both funny and believable. Despite not taking itself too seriously, THE FINAL GIRLS also manages to convey some genuine emotions and a heartfelt story about the loss of a mother. The movie has general appeal to a wide audience but you're more likely going to enjoy this one having seen a few slasher flicks before. In particular, there's numerous references to the original Friday THE 13TH. In being so meta about horror, THE FINAL GIRLS is quite comparable to CABIN IN THE WOODS‚Äîbut it isn't nearly as gory.All in all, I can highly recommend this one."
" Finally¬Ö a new take on a 'slasher' movie
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,7,"Okay, so it's not THAT new ‚Äì after all, you still have a killer running around hacking up a selection of good-looking American teens, but ‚Äì hey ‚Äì it's still better than most of the recent offerings. The premise kind of reminded me of (the much underrated) 'Last Action Hero' in as much as people from our 'real' world end up getting stuck in a movie. However, instead of being the 'comedy relief' to a much-loved Austrian mega-star, our hapless teens find themselves in the traditional middle-of-nowhere setting where they're at the mercy of a fictional masked killer (who bears no small resemblance to one Jason Voorhees).Therefore, like the 'Last Action Hero,' expect all the clich√©s and formulas from a horror/slasher movie to be pointed out along the way (not to mention the odd gruesome kill thrown in there).There are no real stand-out performances here as, despite being a reasonably original take, the character types are pretty much what you'd expect, i.e. the good girl, the trampy girl, the best friend and so on. However, this time round it's all a little more 'knowing' and at least they're aware of their own stereotypes.There are also a few touching moments in the script towards the end that you probably wouldn't expect from a film of this genre. These actually make a welcome break from the general quips and carnage.I wouldn't have watched this film based on either the cover or the title. I should have mentioned that the 'film within a film' is set in the eighties, therefore the cover art is all pretty 'retro' and I thought it just looked like another run-of-the-mill slasher flick. Don't let this put you off. It is definitely worth a watch, but what you get out of this will depend on your existing knowledge of the genre. The more you know about masked killers the more fun you'll have here. Luckily, I seem to know a lot about them, hence I had a blast with this film."
" The rating let it down
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,3,"This film could have been great, I liked the idea and how they were making a tribute to Friday 13th but come on, it's to soft. I've seen more violence and gore in scooby doo, I'm not saying every film has to be a gore fest but if you are making a tribute to the 80's slasher audience how old do you think they are, they are at least in their 40's not teens. If you're gunna do a film go all in not half hearted hoping teenagers will turn up to the cinema, trust me, my cinema is full of adults and I think everyone is getting sick of movies being targeted towards kids.Disappointed"
