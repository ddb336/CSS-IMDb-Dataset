" Zach is hysterical!
",2021-03-24 00:00:00,8,"Zach commits 100% to his roles, and gives himself wholly to this semi-true story, exaggerated for comic effect. I love a good slapstick, juvenile comedy especially when it's in the nuanced hands of actors like Galifinakis and Wiig. Hess has made me laugh hard before, and after a few turkeys, I wondered if he could repeat the trick. All I can say is I had a great time watching this one, and I laughed out loud a lot. Good comedies are a rare breed, and Masterminds is among my faves."
" Solidly entertaining
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,7,"I like this movie's story, pacing, casting, and dialogue. It's more drama than comedy but has some good laughs at times. Based on a true story and I can see why this could happen-infatuation is powerful."
" Good movie
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,9,"This movie is really funny. I like the way the jokes were said. I won't spoiler, but I enjoyed it."
" Nice and funny.
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,6,"Directed by Jared Hess, and stars Zach Galifianakis as Ghantt, Kristen Wiig as Campbell, Owen Wilson as Chambers, and Jason Sudeikis as McKinney.Based on Loomis Fargo Bank Robbery was a robbery of $17.3 million in cash from the Charlotte, North Carolina. It's hard to believe that this movie is based on a true story because of it's kiddish serving many times.But overall a enjoyable film, definitely does have a lot of misses, but can still be enjoyed in bits and pieces.Available on Amazon Prime. Wish more Heist films were made in India too."
" Everything goes wrong in this bank robbery and still they get away with it
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,8,"The laughs get stuck in your throat as you at the same time get the appalling picture of modern America, where no human feelings except very selfish ones are of any matter - these people have no scruples, a human life is worth nothing, as you get the impression that a professional murderer could be hired to kill anyone and even be certain to get away with it, and that nothing is sacred or worth any respect. The comic highlights are many, though, especially as when the hired murderer becomes best friends with his intended victim and crying for it. It is remarkable, though, that this is a true story, and that they actually got away with two million dollars that no one has found any trace of."
" Ok
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,5,Couldn't believe it was based on a True Story. Had some good moments but nothing special.
" Biographical comedy...!!
",2020-12-08 00:00:00,7,"A team plans to rob a bank..
All are acted soo well especially hangover alan..
Worth to watch.."
" Defenitly not bad
",2020-08-27 00:00:00,7,I had my doubts because of the ratings but in the end of am Happy that i watched the movie . Just a fun and easy movie . Would sure watch it again .
" Heavily underrated
",2020-08-25 00:00:00,8,"I'm surprised that is was rated as low as it is. It's a left field comedy, featuring absurd characters-telling a story which is based upon a real life event.The fact that much of the cast are SNL alums, adds to the ease in how they interact with one another. You can tell this would have been a fun set to work on.If you're a fan of any of these comedic actors, you should enjoy this movie. They all embrace the quirkinesses of their characters, with hilarious performances.If you're looking for an in-depth analysis about the actual heist, you should probably head to Wikipedia"
" We Can Still Make Fun Of These People, Can't We?
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,3,"This is one of those comedies in which we are invited to laugh at rednecks because they are stupid.In this case, they steal $17 million and Zach Gallifinakis is set up to take the entire blame. It's one of those movies which I saw because of decent talent, particularly Kristen Wiig, and never quite worked up the will to leave early. I suspect it was a project that some talented people were drawn into because some one else was involve"
" Jason & Zach
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,1,The only positive thing in this movie is Jason Sudeikies .. Zach is great actor but he repeats his self !
" Lots of Laughs
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,7,If you want laughs watch this movie-I have no idea why the overall rating is so low-Kathleen Mackinnon alone is hilarious in a small role. Enjoy.
" Jared Hess is an American Gem
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,8,"I love Hess. I think Nacho Libre is absolutely fantastic and if you enjoyed that I'm sure you'll like this too. The script in this film is hilarious, some of the lines just kill me. That being said, his humor is not for everyone so if you don't like him you won't like this."
" Jared Hess is a Master.
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,9,Everything is funny. His outfits are classic. Every character shines in their own moment. The performances are passionate and the actors are obviously enjoying the hell out of it. Watch it and don't be a little chode about it not being realistic (Even though it's based off of a real heist).
" Funny
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,7,"I find Jared Hess's movies funny. It's that simple. If you liked his previous works I'm sure you'll like this, if not don't bother."
" Made too soon?
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"It's a shame this didn't do so well with critics or box office. I thought this was a great movie! I've been a fan of Jared Hess' work since ""Napoleon Dynamite"", and ""Nacho Libre"". He has yet to let me down and this film did not disappoint. I wasn't really sure what to expect considering this was delayed twice and was only in my local movie theaters for 2 weeks at most. My expectations weren't super low, but I was cautious. I figured at most it would be ""meh."" The fact that it did not do well has nothing to do with the quality of the film. I have a feeling in about 20 years or so, it will be a cult classic comedy. I was laughing so hard throughout most of this movie. There were times where I was missing dialougue and trying to pay attention, because I was still laughing at a joke from 2 minutes ago. I can only imagine the conversation the director had to have with the real people of this film, since it is based on a true story. ""I'm going to turn your life story into a comedy, ok?"" That was either incredibly embarassing, or they were cool with it. The film builds up pretty quickly and just gets crazier and crazier, and even more hilarious as it goes on. I wouldn't consider this a ""smart"" comedy, but if you're looking for a way to kill 90 minutes or you're into turn-off-your-brain screwball comedies, you'll probably enjoy this. It's a hidden gem worth searching for.
Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars"
" Dumb people are worth watching
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,6,Sometimes dumb people are worth watching. Hard to believe this is a true story
" The hesses just make good movies
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,7,They get weird yes. But there's nothing else like them. So sit back and enjoy the weirdness and laugh.
" Funny but faulty
",2020-01-13 00:00:00,5,"There are a few laughs here and there, mostly of the pie-in-the-face school of humour. This is a silly movie about a serious crime, the real-life 16-million dollar heist of an armored truck. Hardly the basis for what is essentially a slap stick comedy. If the producers thought that was an original twist, it didn't work. Perhaps they might have had better luck with the humorous aspects of the Hindenberg explosion or writing snappy one liners for Al Capone. Yes, I laughed a few times. But I also pondered the perversity of casting crooks as comics."
" Only a Few Good Lines in an Otherwise Forgettable Comedy
",2020-01-13 00:00:00,4,If you LOVE Zach Galifianakis then you'll probably enjoy this movie more than most people. For the rest of us: it's a forgettable comedy - loosely based on true story - best seen for free While you take care of other housework.
" Intriguing story but just isn't funny
",2019-12-13 00:00:00,3,"Having not known that this film was based on a true story until the very end, and having seemingly low expectations. Masterminds didn't quite deliver. Enjoying some of the cast previous films and was one of the main reasons for watching.The comedy feels somewhat forced and the accents don't exactly make it better. There are enjoyable moments but as a whole, this movie isn't noteworthy and just isn't funny. Also don't understand some positive reviews claiming how ""hilarious"" this film is. Really no laughs throughout."
" Mastermindless
",2019-12-03 00:00:00,2,"Masterminds is mindless crap! With all the top rated comedians (including many of my FAVs from Saturday Night Live), I was totally disappointed and let down. The story is supposed to be somewhat true...but how can so many bumbling idiots get away with the largest bank heist in American history? I was looking for a laugh in a comedy adventure movie. Instead, I feel laughed at for having endured such a preposterously implausible movie till the end."
" Actually good
",2019-11-03 00:00:00,8,Very good very funny. I don't know why it's 5/10.. people take everything seriously it's comedy it don't have to be perfect
" not terrible, not funny either
",2019-11-02 00:00:00,6,"I rented this movie because i wanted to see kristen wiig in something else besides ghostbusters and zoolander 2.both of her roles in those movies were hilarious. i was pleasantly surprised to find two of her three costars from ghostbusters in this movie too, who i likely wouldn't have recognized but for their voices. holzman (kate mckinnon i think) an leslie jones.so while this movie wasn't particularly funny, i did enjoy watching these three women and that the movie was based on a true story.
likely what the other reviewer said about too many screenwriters ruining the humour is correct.but if you want something that doesn't totally suck and is worth watching once, see it."
" Unwatchable
",2019-10-17 00:00:00,1,"Seriously, guys, this movie is unwatchable. It's cartoonish and goes for the easy laugh. I would not waste your time. I watch a lot of movies and this one is a dismal failure. And I love McKInnon, Wiig, Sudekis, Galifianakis, all very talented, funny people. Don't say I didn't warn you."
" 3 stars!?!? WtF!?
",2019-09-17 00:00:00,9,"Don't count on these stars to tell your movie selection future. The only stars you should trust to mkake you laugh are the ones in this movie! There is serious comic genius, from the entire cast throughout the movie, for those with any depth. Destin to be a cult classic as the deeper you go the funnier it gets. Brilliant :P"
" This movie is so funny, what is wrong with everyone!
",2019-09-17 00:00:00,9,"Every line in this movie has a subtle hilariousness, it's so good. Every character is unique to the actor, and they bring it! If you like each actor's personal work, then you will love this movie as I do.
If you can't find the humor in this movie, then you need to watch it again...and again....and again because it is packed with subtle brilliance.
One of the funniest movies I've ever seen, a cult classic."
" Funny
",2019-07-26 00:00:00,6,Funny but true account of a monumental armored vehicle heist with excellent acting by Zach Galifianakis.
" Funny but avarage comedic value
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,5,"I love the comedy this movie trys to portray. But not something I would recommend for everyone. Slow & predictable storyline. If you've time to watch something in general, this is the movie."
" my notes
",2019-07-22 00:00:00,4,Interesting story. overall the movie was pretty comedic but not laugh out loud funny. i only laughed a few times and a lot of the jokes fell flat or forced. it was very dumb at times and i hated the performances by leslie jones and her partner. everyone else was decent. no one stood out (1 viewing)
" Why not just tell the real story?
",2019-05-04 00:00:00,2,"Wow, a swing and a miss! The true story of this robbery has the potential to make a very good movie, and even a funny one. The actual people were not very clever, which has good comic possibilities, but in this movie they're portrayed as drooling morons. Instead we're treated to the cheapest slapstick you can imagine and all kinds of over-the-top character wackiness. If they had done this a straight-forward telling of the robbery, even with this cast, it could have been good and humorous, because of relatable situations. Instead we get increasingly absurd events that don't feel at all real. That kind of slapstick could possiblhy work if it's funny, but it's not.One more thing: Zach has diarrhea in the hotel swimming pool. That's the level of humor we're talking about here. ""Joe Dirt"" is a masterpiece by comparison; at least it's funny."
" Light Hearted Fun Movie
",2019-03-12 00:00:00,8,03/12/2019 An enjoyable fun movie to watch with a few laughs along the way. Watch for yourself and decide. Bon Appetit
" The worst comedy film I've ever seen in my life.
",2019-03-05 00:00:00,1,"The worst comedy film I've ever seen in my life. Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad."
" It's ok
",2019-02-05 00:00:00,6,"Even though it's gotten bad reviews, I gave it a 6 because I did think it was funny in some parts. I wasn't disappointed in watching it."
" Masterminds stars some of the funniest names in comedy. Too bad the movie isn't funny.
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,3,"Zach Galifianakis turns a public swimming pool brown after eating a Super Taco somewhere from a local stand in Mexico. With jokes like that, how can this movie possibly be a failure?"
" Perfect mindless entertainment
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,10,"Bad jokes. Check.
Unbelievable (but based on history) plot: Check
Love story: Check-ish
More bad jokes: Check
Mindless Entertainment: CHECK CHECK"
" The true story is more interesting than the movie
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,3,"There is something off with Masterminds. It just feels slightly off-kilter when it comes to the acting, the editing, the story and the humor -- and not in a good way. It's almost funny, but not quite. I don't recommend watching this half-baked comedy, but the true story it's based on is interesting."
" Fun to watch.
",2018-09-04 00:00:00,4,Excellent music selection. We enjoyed watching this. Not too fast paced. Zach Galifianakis was actually tolerable.
" If you like unpredictable happy endings
",2018-08-27 00:00:00,8,"This was shaping up to be a huge disappointment if you know about the true story. It cannot end well for even the most likeable and gullible crooks (e.g., Zach Galifianakis) and that made the early parts irritating. The stupidity of the plotters and subordinates seems over the top, and yet, it actually happened. The surprise is the script is written as black comedy while sticking to the basic plot points. So, if one likes black comedy (making fun of dimwits) then this is loaded with lots of great lines and sight gags. Once I got over myself I was laughing steadily throughout. It is family friendly for the most part and all the stars are superb. When I have a happy ending to look forward to, I tend to relax and enjoy a good comedy film more. So I hope people like me will see it and I wish there were a lot more films like this made. I apologize to the producers, directors and stars for not seeing this in the theater. They actually used real film which made it beautiful to look at. If I had known just some of the above I would have been there several times."
" Disappointing....
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,5,I was hoping to get laughs throughout but instead got one or two smirks. I feel like they try really hard to be funny. Jokes just don't seem to flow. It has many jokes and I love dumb movies with dumb jokes but for some reason this one just didn't do it for me. Perhaps because it was it was based on true events is the reason I can't grasp the jokes. This movies is not to be taken seriously and I knew that going in but I am truly disappointed by it.
" HILARIOUS!
",2018-08-02 00:00:00,10,I haven't laughed this hard in a long time! Loved it! We constantly quote this movie now.
" Great humor
",2018-07-09 00:00:00,8,"This is a fictionalized account of an actual event, so I can't really say how accurately it portrays things, but one thing I am sure of: I have not laughed this hard at a movie in a long time. The chase scene with the main character on roller skates had me laughing so hard I nearly fell out of my chair."
" Lost potential.
",2018-07-09 00:00:00,7,A lot of potential with different big name comedic actors but it just misses everything.Edit: it got better.
" Funny as leprosy!
",2018-07-07 00:00:00,2,"It's a stupid story about stupid, stupid people. It's not so much comedy as poor farce and slapstick and if you get one laugh out of the movie, good luck to you. Unless you're American as many reviewer seem to be, and apologies to any Americans who really do have a sense of humour. Yeah, I'm British!The script is awful with coincidence building on coincidence. C'mon guys! No surprise it took 4 people to pull it together! What a Smörgåsbord! Based on a true story? Yeah, like, someone robs a bank!Can not believe that Owen Wilson got involved in it. He's always good value and he's as good as he can be in this. Best of the bunch is Kristen Wiig but the acting is dire. There are a couple of ok cameos but most are too far OTT.Please, avoid!"
" HILARITY AS ART...!
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,10,How in the hell in a cinematic universe did Masterminds get lost in the miasma of bad comedies that keep coming out week after week? Directed by the co-mastermind (sorry!) behind Napolean Dynamite & Nacho Libre comes another inspired piece of lunacy (based on a real case) which builds & builds like a collage of hilarity. This is the kind of flick all others should study for inspiration & instruction.
" Should Have Been Funnier
",2018-06-04 00:00:00,6,"Considering all the acting talent involved, this should have been hilarious. It was mildly amusing, mostly due to the over-the-top acting by Kate McKinnon. Zach Galifianakis is David Ghantt, a real life Loomis Armored Car employee who robbed the company of $17.3m in 1997. Galifianakis plays him as a kind of hillbilly rube. Kristen Wiig is an ex-employee who pretends to be sweet on Ghantt to get him to steal the money. Owen Wilson is the leader of the heist. Leslie Jones is an FBI agent investigating the crime. Jason Sudeikis is a hit man sent to kill Ghantt. Finally, Kate McKinnon is Ghantt's crazy girlfriend, Jandice. She steals the show.None of this really holds up to much scrutiny. The plot is silly (albeit based on a true story). None of the actors seems to be taking it seriously and the movie never really picks up steam when it should. It was enjoyable with Sudeikis and McKinnon standing out, but overall this was a wasted opportunity. The film, Logan Lucky, with a similar theme of a heist by a bunch of amateurs is much better."
" Not that funny
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,6,"I wanted to like it, but I didn't laugh that much. It was very odd where I couldn't tell if parts of it were supposed to be funny. There was no reason why 17 million was stolen and I find it hard to believe it was all a true story."
" It made me laugh
",2018-04-10 00:00:00,9,"I don't know if I happen to just have different taste in things, but I can't honestly believe the reviews were as bad as they are. I thought it fit the bill as a comedy. It made me laugh. Comedy is such a subjective thing anyway. There isn't a lot of high-brow humor. That's okay. I loved the ladies in Ghostbusters and they're all here except McCarthy. Zack and Owen are fun also. It didn't make me laugh like The Hangover or Borat, but seriously most ""comedies"" that are targeted for the masses make me want to to stab myself. If you liked NTSF:SD:SUV, Rick and Morty, Children's Hospital or other things along those lines, I think this will do you just fine. I'll take my South Park to whatever canned laughter show any day of the week and this fits that bill."
" Just got slightly dumber from watching it... But not dumb enough to like it
",2018-02-20 00:00:00,5,"And I don't mean just from watching the goofballs in the movie, which was sort of expected. But from having wasted two hours of my life on this crap. It seemed promising at first with brilliant comedians like Zach Galifianakis and Kristen Wiig, but their talent is completely wasted on a criminally stupid script.Ostensibly based on ""a real story"", but really an imaginary concoction - from the contract killer in Mexico trying to shoot Ghantt with a musket, the capture in a bathtub, the killer finding he has the identical name and deciding not to kill Ghantt, overpowering the Mexican police at the airport, crashing the BMW at the iron gate, wife and mistress fighting at the Walmart, and so on and on. The similarities to what happened in real life and in the movie could be summarized in a few sentences. (But why? The real story wouldn't have needed to be ""improved"".) And this goes even for the general appearance of the main characters. But the final nail in the coffin is that this satire isn't even really funny.I can't believe this was ""based on a true story"". And neither will anyone else with more than half a brain. Because it's not."
" What's with all the bad reviews?
",2018-01-26 00:00:00,8,"I have watched this film three times and enjoyed every minute of it.It's campy, bizarre and the anaconda contact-lens scene has me in stitches every time."
" Was the True Story a Comedy?
",2018-01-23 00:00:00,4,"With this cast, you can imagine that there's not a serious moment in the entire film. And, there isn't."
" Saturday Night live film
",2017-11-25 00:00:00,6,This film is like the Saturday night live version of a true story that is a bit funny to start with. The DVD extras had the true story told by the thief and the FBI. The whole film is uniformly crazy acted with total lack of serious. The film makers mostly exaggerated what happened in real life but they continued the story differently than reality at the point where the thief was to be killed by the mastermind. It was the second biggest heist of the USA history. The red head thief actually sounds and looks a lot like a friend of mine. Funny.
" Comedic Bank Heist
",2017-10-16 00:00:00,6,"(Flash Review)One would think that driving an armored truck for a living and knowing how much cash is sitting behind you that it may be tempting to dream about stealing it. Actually based on a true story, this is what one man attempted to do. Sparked during conversations with a lovely coworker, the two assemble am idiotic team to plan the heist. Of course with many heist movies there is some double crossing involved. How will things shake out once the wheels are in motion? Much of the cast is from Saturday Night Live and there are many slapstick moments along with bone-headed decisions. Overall, it is a stupid funny movie with the tone more crass than clever and of course it is over the top in moments."
" I'd rob a funeral home for you
",2017-08-29 00:00:00,8,"The film is based on a true story of an odd group of characters who robbed Loomis Fargo, the biggest bank heist in American history. The film centers on David Ghantt (Zach Galifianakis) who was sweet talked into the robbery by Kelly Campbell (Kristen Wiig). Steven Eugene Chambers (Owen Wilson) was the mastermind behind the robbery and failed to lay low and leave town.The film was a fairly decent comedy, even without the factor being based on an actual event. Zach plays a mild mannered character reminding me of Jack Black as Bernie. Good for a laugh.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity. Sexual innuendo, nothing explicit or overtly vulgar, such as: ""I don't want him to finger me"" type of stuff."
" A Masterful Movie
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,8,"Masterminds is one of the few comedies that caused me to suddenly laugh so hard that I scared my roommate. This is followed by long and quiet scenes.His comedic style uses a slow approach, wacky characters, methodical development and abrupt awkward situations.This film will not appeal to people who like crude humor, foul banter and mindless slapstick.Instead, it will appeal to people who like plot twists, hilarious reactions and funny runarounds.I like Jared Hess' other films (Nacho Libre) and Masterminds didn't disappoint me."
" Just not funny enough
",2017-07-06 00:00:00,4,"There are two types of comedic actors in the world. There are the ones who can adequately deliver a funny performance provided they are given a great script to work with, and then there are the geniuses who can take any material and make it hilarious regardless. Unfortunately for 'Masterminds' the cast is filled entirely with the former. Also sadly for 'Masterminds' it doesn't have a brilliant script to work with.You might look at the cast on paper and think that looks like a hell of a line-up. But is it really? Zach Galifianakis shot to fame through 'The Hangover' but has failed to achieve anything since. The reason? He's a one-trick pony and he can't pull off any other sort of role. Owen Wilson can be good, but only at playing off someone who is hilarious in the role opposite (think 'Wedding Crashers') and there is no one funny for him to play off in this movie. Kristen Wiig may be well known now for 'Bridesmaids' but was she actually that funny in that movie? As far as I remember almost every laugh I got in that film came from Melissa McCarthy.So the movie isn't funny, but what about the story? Is it interesting enough to carry a film? Not really. It's about as basic as stories come. No intricacy or cleverness is apparent at any stage of the movie and some of the plot points are nothing short of idiotic it has to be said. In fairness it was based on a true story (although I have to suspect some pretty big liberties were taken).I read that Jim Carrey was at one point attached to play the lead role. It's sad that fell through because he is someone who can get blood from a stone. Sadly though it wasn't meant to be and instead this film will forever live in mediocrity."
" Among the talented comedic cast, it is sporadically funny and clever at times, but nothing special
",2017-06-22 00:00:00,6,"Masterminds is one of those rare comedies that tackles a shocking true story that made national news headlines, and blends it in with goofy PG-13-esque humor. The brain behind this comedic endeavor happens to be no other than Jared Hess, the man behind such comedies like 'Napoleon Dynamite', 'Nacho Libre', and the critically roasted 'Gentlemen Broncos'. So what is the big story? It is the 1997 Loomis Fargo robbery which scored the headlines as to earning the title ""the biggest bank robbery in American history"". It is both a shocking and complex crime committed by wide cast of individuals. Now whether or not this movie succeeds on delivering the laughs and fun of this astonishing lies the big question. Boasting a talented comedic cast, this movie does not fail to spare some good laughs here and there, but sporadically falls flat in other places. The hit-and-miss ratio in the joke department is not too high, but certainly not low enough to make it a comedic bore. Set in 1997, this film follows Dave Ghantt (played by Zach Galifianakis), a 36-year old man working at mundane job as a guardsman for the Loomis Fargo bank. When he is convinced by his crush Kelly (played by Kristin Wiig) to pull an seemingly impossible task of robbing $17,000 in cash, he unexpectedly finds himself double-crossed by one of his accomplices Steve Chambers (played by Owen Wilson) who threatens to turn him in to the FBI. Upon fleeing to Mexico, Dave is faced with a dangerous encounter with a hit-man named Dave McKinney (played by Jason Sudeikis) who Steve hires to kill. There is only so much you can with a comedy picture starring a vast range of actors who each have had their fair share of satisfying comedic endeavors in the past. The most difficult task Jared Hess takes on here is effectively executing its true-story-based plot in a laugh-evoking manner while avoiding the restraints of its complexity. For the most part, he somewhat succeeds. But it doesn't quite make up for the occasional botched attempts at humor, especially when its peddling on butt jokes and slapstick humor. After all, everyone in the cast is only giving much to do with a script that places a limit on their comedic muscles. Boarding the center role is Zach Galifianakis who serves as the driving force of the story. Resorting to his ""guy with an absent mind"" typecast, his character maintains roughly the same level of stupidity as his character Alan from the 'The Hangover' trilogy, only it is less funny here. Of course, he does manage to score just a few good laughs every once a while. But arguably the biggest show stealer is Jason Sudeikis who lands the most laughs out of everyone in the cast. His chemistry with Galifianakis is surprisingly effective, even more than Galifianakis's glamor with Kristin Wiig and Owen Wilson (who is somehow never funny throughout the entire picture). The heist scene which marks the turning plot of the plot is finely executed and provides a good laugh or two. If you go in expecting something of car crashes and shootouts to add to the energy, you will certainly set yourself up for disappointment, although there is one major action sequence late in the film.Masterminds is a sporadically funny caper comedy with just a fair amount of clever and wit, but not enough a worth while picture. There are good attempts at laughs handed from such an appealing comedic cast, particularly Jason Sudeikis. By the end, the film is nothing remarkable nor does hit the high points of any of the cast members' careers."
" Zach Galifianakis and other cast members were awesome
",2017-06-20 00:00:00,8,"I watched this not knowing what to expect and found myself laughing a lot and enjoying it thoroughly. I was surprised to see that it was not better received (not too surprised though, as it seems only the most popular movies get any positive reviews and there tends to be a bandwagon effect). Based on true story of one of the largest cash heists in history, it follows the crazy story of its perpetrators and their attempts to avoid being caught. Zach Galifianakis and other cast members are hilarious. The makers of the film obviously took pains to add little details to every scene that really add to the comedy. In the beginning, for example, there is a scene of awkwardfamilyphotos.com style engagement photos that is so great. Plot twists as the film progressed to its conclusion kept the story interesting. There were some parts that were hard to buy, but it was a comedy after all. It's on Netflix currently."
" ""Vaya con Dios, compadre.""
",2017-06-19 00:00:00,7,"If this is based on a true story, and it was, I can't believe a bunch of nimrods like this were able to pull it off. Coming off looking even worse to my mind was the security company Loomis Fargo, which didn't seem to have any measures in place to prevent something like this from happening. The actual robbery took place in October of 1997, so that's not that long ago for the company to have gotten with the times. Having just read a summary of that heist, the details in the film are amazingly accurate, right down to the picture of Elvis hanging over the fireplace of the Chambers home. Unbelievable.As far as the movie goes, it's got it's share of hits and misses, with the funny parts coming across as slapstick more than anything else. I'm not a big fan of movies with Saturday Night Live alumni in them, and this one had a couple in Kristen Wiig and Kate McKinnon. Both were OK here and that's as much as I'll concede, but considering the inane nature of the story, they fit right in with the kind of forced humor the picture came up with.For some real laughs, stick around for the outtakes following the film because they're funnier than the movie itself. You know, The Bowery Boys made a 1949 movie titled ""Master Minds"", and in comparing the two one would be hard pressed to decide which one had a dumber cast of idiots. In the Bowery Boys flick, Huntz Hall is gifted with a mind reading ability to predict the future. If he could have told us about this one coming out in 2016, we would have all been better forewarned."
" just funny
",2017-06-12 00:00:00,8,"Jared Hess's ""Masterminds"" is the sort of movie that you'll appreciate if you accept low humor. I do. It might be a surprise to learn that the movie is based on a true story (the October 1997 Loomis Fargo robbery). I'm sure that a lot of what the movie shows is added for comic relief, and to let the cast members do their stuff. Even so, they lay everything out quite well, as the scheme's main man sets up the armored car driver as a patsy.While Zach Galifianakis, Owen Wilson and Kristen Wiig are the top-billed stars, some of the best lines come from Leslie Jones (if she's in a movie, you know that it's gonna be good). As expected, Kate McKinnon and Jason Sudeikis also turn in good performances. Basically, the combination of the heist, the snappy dialogue, and the occasional gross-out humor makes for one funny movie. Betcha never thought that an Enya song would get used this way! It's also gotten noted that three of the four modern Ghostbusters star in this movie. 2016's ""Ghostbusters"" is a criminally underrated movie. It's hard to believe that there are people who call it one of the worst movies ever while still regarding as masterpieces the obnoxious ""Everyone Says I Love You"", the vacuous ""Eyes Wide Shut"", and the pointless ""Man on the Moon""."
" Not Very Funny for a ""Comedy""
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,2,"Only part of the movie where I laughed was when he accidentally shot his butt in the first part of the movie.Zach Galifianakis is never good as a lead actor - he always plays a lovable retard, and for that reason, he's only good as a supporting actor.The story was OK when it was following the actual story, but once it started deviating, Galifianakis suddenly became 007 for a short while, which was just ridiculous and not keeping with the theme at all.Another turnoff is that the movie appears to mock and make fun of people living in rural areas.It's like a cross between ""Pain & Gain"" and ""Nacho Grande"", but it just fell flat. It had no pizazz. It was lame."
" I don't usually like this kind of movie
",2017-06-03 00:00:00,7,"I had a feeling it would have ""dumb humor"". I'm a 63 year old woman and have seen enough fart jokes in my life. Still most of the humor wasn't that bad and was actually funny.There were some pretty silly scenes and the action pieces weren't really violent as I thought before watching it, as I'm tired of all the violence in movies. But twice I could obviously see they were using dummies in the action shots, which distracts from the movie and shows poor quality.I really like the actors. The lead is Zach Galifianakis; most of his movies are kinda like this one, but my favorite of his was ""It's Kind of a Funny Story"". There's also Kristen Wiig of Saturday Night Live fame and Owen Wilson (from the Fockers & Zoolanders series of movies).Wasn't great, but it can make you laugh."
" The man behind Napolean Dynamite fails again
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,4,"After his cult hit debut with Napoleon Dynamite in 2004, director Jared Hess has failed to recapture the odd brilliance of that film with uneasy comedies in the form of films like Gentleman Broncos and Nacho Libre and while the long talked about and pushed back Masterminds sounded like a film on paper perfectly suited to the filmmaker, this uneven comedy can't maximise the cast or story at its disposal to become a film of note.Based on a bizarre yet true story, Masterminds appears to be tailor made for Hess to unleash some comedy gold, which we get snippets of throughout and when you add to the off-kilter cocktail the likes of a bearded and weirded Zach Galifianakis as our bumbling protagonist David Ghantt, a dumbed down Kristen Wiig, a creepy Owen Wilson and another left of centre turn from the 'it"" girl of comedy at the moment Kate McKinnon, it feels as though Masterminds could've been one of 2016's stand out comedies, in a year in which there wasn't a lot to challenge for the mantle.The main problem that Masterminds runs into is within its tone, as Hess struggles to figure out whether the film is a slapstick comedy, an oddball farce or some form of crime caper combined together with an array of bonkers character creations and it feels as though both filmmaker and cast were unable to unlock just what this 90 minute exercise in frustration, mixed with belly laughs was supposed to be.Another anchor to the films chances of sailing the seas of comedic success is the continued downward spiral of Galifianakis, who ever since breaking out in the first Hangover adventure has become an increasingly disappointing performer.Not far from being a self-parody at most times, Galifianakis's ability to lead a film must surely be in question by now (especially after the failings of Keeping up with the Joneses last year also) and despite him getting the odd moment to shine here, it's really up to the supporting cast to try and gain the films some extra laughs which do come from the likes of Wiig and a small supporting turn from Jason Sudeikis as a dedicated hit-man.A potentially great comedy turned into a merely tolerable one, Masterminds is quite a big letdown upon consideration of its core story and talented cast and it seems as though if Hess can't turn this story into something, he may forever be known as the ""guy"" that made Napoleon Dynamite.2 pairs of braces out of 5"
" Masterminds, A Comical Masterpiece?
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,7,"Masterminds, a comical masterpiece?With an all-star cast, and a movie script so bizarre it must be true—yes, this is a true story—I expected to be thoroughly entertained, and I was not let down. ""Masterminds"" is a breath of fresh air that showcases the awkwardly funny talents of Zach Galifinakis, Kirstin Wiig, and Owen Wilson.The movie centers itself around one of the largest heists in history, orchestrated by a Man named Steve (Wilson) and carried out by a Man named David Ghantt (Galifianakis) who did it all for his crush on a co-worker, Kelly (Wiig). These are a bunch of blue-collar, uneducated group of people, looking for something better. Kelly soon realizes Ghantt has a crush on her and uses this knowledge to get close to Ghantt, in order to convince him to steal the money. At one point, they go to the gun range to discuss what they would do with a million dollars, and Ghantt has an accidental discharge of his weapon while trying to holster it in the rear of his waistband. Kelly then exclaims: ""Oh my gosh! David, let me see! That bullet just went straight between your cheeks!"" It was an unlikely heist, perpetrated by an even more unlikely group of individuals.All in all, the movie was light hearted, didn't take itself too seriously and made me laugh all the way through. Overall I give this movie an A. It is entertaining as it is unbelievable. The movie is now on video and would make an excellent add for your collection."
" A disappointing movie with a great cast
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,5,"This movie coasts by on the good will previously generated by the people appearing in it. I've seen all these actors in better films, I like them, this time it just doesn't work. I was interested in the true story the film is based upon. These events occurred in King's Mountain, 20 minutes from the town where I grew up in the 90's. So, I can say that the personalities of the locals where slightly exaggerated, though it was the 90's!"
" Great jokes, great comedians, ruined by a terrible director and camera work
",2017-03-21 00:00:00,1,"This awful movie has it all: Great characters, great set up, good jokes, great moments... but none of them work.Awkward camera work. Bad editing. Strange shots that add nothing to the story. Strange camera movement. What a ruined opportunity.I think a possible redemption is a sequel directed by a different director, but that would not work with the ""real story"" aspect.It nags on me to want it to work. As the Donald would say, sad."
" Man tends to do crazy stuffs for a woman, but stealing $17m is too crazy.
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,7,"The film reminded me 'Pain & Gain', only for inspiring from the real and being the comedy flicks. Other than that there's nothing in common between them. I have been expecting a lot from Zack since 'The Hangover', but it was always the near missed opportunities. I'm not saying this was his much needed breakthrough, but quite enjoyable film.An honest man who worked long enough as a guard for a bank, was approached by his ex colleague and her men with an offer. Since he was madly in love with her, he could not say no to it, despite he already got engaged to another woman. As planned the heist goes on and once it was done, he was ditched and ratted out. Now on the run, how he responds to it and the following events decides his fate.Not a great comedy nor a heist film, but it had its moments. The casting was good and it was Zack's show. The rest of them were not into that much, except in the final act. Jason Sudeikis was a bonus. His appearance added more fun. Now I know why Jim Carrey opted out. Owen Wilson's part was not good enough in such a small role, he did good though. Watching it for timepass is fine or even for beyond that seems not a bad try.7/10"
" Not awful
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,6,"Certainly, Zach Galifiankis and Kristen Wiig aren't quite as funny as they believe themselves to be and they struggle to carry the underwritten ""Masterminds"" but still, the film is an innocuous curiosity. Telling the real-life story of a David Ghannt who managed to rob the Loomis Fargo armored truck he was responsible for without having formulated any type of plan to avoid detection or to escape. If Ghannt actually anything like Galifiankis' redention of him, he likely was destined for jail the first time someone gave his access to a large amount of cash. Wiig's Kelly was simply the first to manipulate him into doing it. Wiig plays both sides with Kelly portraying her as aggressive and slutty but never doing more than appearing in a sports bra. Luckily Jason Dudekis doesn't appear into well into the film so we are largely spared his contribution. The jokes mainly are represented by a scene used in the trailer where David and Kelly slam into an unmoved security gate in a BMW providing a twist on a thousand similar movie scenes where the gates fly away from the impact. It's not a great joke but it's not awful either. In short, that a good way to sum up the film."
" Very funny flick, deserves more credit!
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,10,"I was a little hesitant watching this film because of all the negative reviews. But Jared Hess, the director of Napoleon Dynamite, along with the comedic talent, made a damn good comedy.There are a lot of fun gags and ridiculous costumes and it definitely falls in the zany category of comedy films. Zak G carries this film and the supporting cast were all excellent.There's also a few gross-out moments that give the film a well-balanced comedic palate.I'm surprised it's rated so lowly. This film might not be for everyone, but it's very funny and deserves much more love.Maybe if you're a struggling Marxist it might not be your cup of tea, but if you just want some good ol' laughs I highly recommend it. Actually, you must watch it, it's based on a true story and provides a nice history lesson too.Go watch it now!"
" Hilarious SNL cast vehicle tells true story of Loomis Fargo Heist
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed this movie and laughed my arse off. This movie tells the true story of the Oct 4, 1997 Loomis heist. It changes some details to improve the storytelling and comedy, to good effect.Zach Galifianakis is hilarious as the hapless Loomis guard David Ghantt, who falls for his sexy co-employee Kelly Campbell (the equally hilarious Kristen Wiig) and is talked into a heist scheme by her and her flop house friend Steve Chambers, played to perfection by Owen Wilson, although the real Steve Chambers looks hilarious and Owen should have dyed his hair and gone with the stache in this one to portray him.Almost stealing the show is Kate McKinnon as David's terrifyingly hilarious off-the-wall batshitcrazy fiancé. Other SNL fan favorites fill out the cast, but nobody else comes close to the comedy work of Galif, Wiig, McKinnon, and Wilson, all at the top of their game."
" The Vidiot Reviews...
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,4,"MastermindsThe easiest way to steal millions is to swipe a lotto winner's oversized novelty cheque.However, the morons in this comedy opted for robbing their workplace.Security guard David Scott Ghantt (Zach Galifianakis) is cajoled into pilfering his armoured vehicle by a co-worker, Kelly Campbell (Kristen Wiig), and her boyfriend, Steve Chambers (Owen Wilson).While David hits Mexico after the heist with minimal cash, Steve squanders millions on a mansion back in America. When the FBI (Leslie Jones) starts sniffing around, Steve sends a hit-man down south to silence David. But fate has other plans.An absurd satire that uses zany Internet humour and ridiculous dialogue to retell the true tale of the ill-fated 1997 Loomis-Fargo robbery, Masterminds makes it difficult to discern fact from wacky fiction. Nonetheless, its abstruse jokes do deliver some unexpected chortles.Moreover, you also get a free getaway vehicle when you holdup an armoured car. Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"
" Funny in parts but really disappointing and I'm glad I waited to rent this rather than go to the theatre for it.
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,6,"""My name is David Ghantt. I always felt I was destined for a life of adventure. It didn't quite pan out that way. Then one day I met Miss Kelly Campbell."" David Ghantt (Galifianakis) works for an armored car company, is engaged to be married and is loving life. He starts to develop a little crush on his co-worker Kelly (Wiig) which results in an opportunity for one of Kelly's friends. David becomes involved in one of the biggest bank heists in US history, with no clue of what he is actually involved in. First of all I have to say that this movie was decent and I laughed a few times, but I was very disappointed. I watched Keeping Up With The Joneses which I thought was very funny, and this one was not nearly as good. The one huge saving grace of this movie was Jason Sudeikis. He saved this movie pretty much by himself. I would watch an entire movie based on that character. The rest of the movie felt a little flat and uninspired and the only thing that really kept me interested, besides Sudeikis, was that it was based on a true story and I wanted to see what actually happened. Overall, funny in parts but really disappointing and I'm glad I waited to rent this rather than go to the theatre for it. I give this a C+."
" Embarrassingly horrible
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,1,"How? Why? What in the world? I'm 20 mins into this garbage and I can't take it anymore. It is that bad. It is horrible.Everything about it is bad: the casting, the acting, the script, the makeup, the wardrobe - everything. Owen Wilson agreed to do this? How? Why? The characters aren't believable, the ""comedy"" is superbly cheesy slapstick with a generous serving of crass and gross to boot.This is yet another movie to add to the list of ""how in the world did this get made?"" Why is Hollywood producing this garbage? Is The Producers for real, and the producers of this and other recent movies making money off flops? Because there is no other explanation."
" Kind of fun stuff for holidays
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,7,"What can I say, the movie was a classic and perfectly normal in an American style. Whole story looks like a few decades ago. The main idea of the film is that the couple is trying to fool the person who will do all the dirty work and stole the money, but they themselves remain white and clean. But as comedies everything happens through humor and when he was stealing, he miss important security facts. But in the end, however, everything ends happily and the main character is a free and rich.The film will not make you laugh to blow out cheeks and get your belly hurt, but will have a good holiday movie to pass the time and have a bit of fun."
" Well I thought it was pretty funny at least
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,7,"No it's not perfect, the writing could have been better and I Kate McKinnon didn't do a whole lot for me and Owen Wilson was a little too 'typical' albeit not bad.But overall it still managed to entertain. A bit slow in the first half but the second half quite the opposite.Based on a true story, although I'm sure as with all Hollywood films they change tons of stuff around, especially in this as it is a goofy comedy.Zach Galifianakis is funny in the lead, but surprisingly it's Leslie Jones I found the funniest in a smaller role maybe tied with Jason Sudekis who shows up in the second half... and Kristen Wiig wasn't too bad either.So yeah if you want to watch something silly and like the main cast then yeah why not give it a go."
" For fans of Almost Heroes, Spy, Bottle Rocket
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,8,"I didn't hear a peep about this film all last year. I discovered it while IMDb'ing Keeping Up With The Joneses. This movie should enter the canon along with Bottle Rocket, Spy, The Whole 9 Yards or The Spy Who Knew Too Little. It was goofy but in all the right ways. There is a very brief appearance by Ken Marino. In a way that worked against the film because Ken is so funny and only briefly in the story. Anytime McKinnon is on the screen you will laugh. That is guaranteed, as in any of her films. This one is highly recommended. Surprised of it's current IMDb rating which is what inspired this review."
" Funny without being crude
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,8,I liked this comic take on a true life crime story about a bank heist. There is quite a collection of comic talent here and they are given a chance to shine as various types of white trash. Zach has been quite annoying in some previous movies but here he is the star and he is good. Kristin is good too and prettier than usual. Owen Wilson is always welcome. Jason is fairly funny too.The good part of this comedy is it doesn't rely on excessive crudeness than plagues recent comedies in order to be funny. The story itself is funny and there are quite a few unexpected laugh out loud moments as the action goes from NC to Mexico.Worth a watch.
" I am speechless...
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,1,"Did ANY producers read the script before giving it their thumbs up? Was the audience at the test screen high? Were Zach Galifianakis, Owen Wilson, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones and Jason Sudeikis so utterly broke that they had no choice but to do this movie? Who are the scree writers? I don't mean ""who are they"" as in ""what are their names?"". I mean what kind of people write this trash and manage to maintain some semblance of self respect? Please, don't make the mistake I did of watching it. Just say ""no"". Don't even watch the trailer. If You are still reading this, you have wasted too much time on this disaster."
" Not that bad. Made me laugh enough to make it worth watching.
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,7,"If you look at just the cast you'll expect more, but it's still not as bad as many make it out to be. It's a good movie for when you just need a good laugh and you don't need the movie to be sophisticated or deep. Did I think it was a particularly good movie? No. Did it make me laugh out loud? Yes, plenty of times. There are a couple gross out humour moments, but not that many. It's mostly just silly jokes.I wouldn't go to the theatre to see this, but it's a good one to catch on Netflix or something. I don't regret watching it, because I got what I expected out of it: A forgettable movie with a bunch of laughs.The fact that it was based on a true story (though I'm sure they changed a bunch of details) only makes it more interesting."
" Silly doesn't equal funny
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,3,"What could possibly go wrong?The director of Napoleon Dynamite, Jared Hess, teams up with the A-list of Hollywood's comedians in a film based on the largest robbery in US history.Sounds to good to be true, doesn't it.What we get, kind of, is like two solid hours of Zach Galifianakis doing his Alan shtick from Hangover. It's bad taste and hijinks and unbelievably bad Texan accents and the neon-coloured Eighties. It's silly, but never acquires enough momentum to be funny.A classic case of too much of a good thing, really. Maybe Jared and Zach are too much alike in their love of wackiness."

Masterminds was a well done movie and deserves to be watched. Please watch this movie and do not listen to the negative people, they will just keep on hating. I am very proud to own something from this great film too! I shall treasure it always. Please give Masterminds a chance you will be glad you did. This movie is vey entertaining!"
