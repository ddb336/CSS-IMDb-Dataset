" Do not miss it .
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,9,If you are a fan of musicals or not it's not to be missed Jersey boys is a excellent movie on so many levels and as a fan of some of there hits made it for myself that much more enjoyable to watch this is a movie that I had to buy to watch again and again when the mood took me . Clint Eastwood take a bow .
" Wasted Opportunity - Needed a Different Director
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,4,"Clint Eastwood is a great director - ""Unforgiven,"" ""Million Dollar Baby,"" ""Bridges of Madison County,"" but he's the wrong director for this musical. Usually, his films are lean and mean. As is, this film is lifeless, flat, and cliched. Only during the singing, dancing end credits does it show any life.
Who would have done a better job? Martin Scorsese. He's directed mob movies. He's directed a musical ""New York, New York"" in addition to music documentaries."
" WOW!!! Completely Exceeded my Expectations!!!
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,10,"This movie was great!!! Someone recommended it to me years ago, but movies based on Broadway hits just aren't really my thing. Well, this movie was FANTASTIC!!! Great story, and I laughed out loud many, many times!!!
The musical number in the end credits was just icing on the delicious slice of cake!!!"
" Yes - See the play and you will get it..
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,2,"Please read eddie-baggins review - It is so spot-on. The story is so compelling, the play is so good -- it was so disappointing to cringe at the many dead spots, bad timing, and plot gaffes in this movie. And it's Direction mostly.
Really bad lip-syncing by the female singer in the recording studio. This is not editing, but a plain bad performance by the actor.
And ohhh - the horrible contrived scene when Gaudio puts the scarf on Frankie and says ' we wouldn't want you to catch pneumonia too.' On WHAT PLANET would anyone say that to a grieving father? It was the clumsiest, most childish dialog ever, obviously to rationalize an uncomfortable subject. It was accepted that Francine had a drug overdose - that's the sad story. Throwing in the suggestion of pneumonia was just needless and SO stupid.
One more thing to vent here - the brief choreography for ""Walk Like A Man"" - What happend there - that never happened in real performances, never happened in the musical, and may be one of the worst film effects in history. Find any evidence that the Four Seasons ever did that horrible movement - you won't."
" Despite timeline errors, very enjoyable
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,8,"If you can overlook the inconsistencies in the timeline (I.e. ""Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You"" was released in 1967; ""My Eyes Adored You"" hit the charts in 1975), the excellent production, acting and direction makes up for it. Cast did a great job! Overall a very entertaining film."
" Everything You Could Ask
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,10,"Remarkable direction from Clint Eastwood, who can apparently do anything! The stage play is beautifully adapted to film, with many of the original actors reprising their roles in this biopic. The story of the rise and fall and rise of The Four Seasons is filled with great dramatic scenes with all the group's greatest hits woven beautifully into the film. The last act is a blast, when the whole cast sings ""Oh, What a Night"" dancing in the street. This is everything you could ask for in a musical film."
" Clint's worst
",2020-03-17 00:00:00,2,"Clint Eastwood is a Hall of Fame fimmaker. His batting average is great but ""Jersey Boys"" is not. It's unwatchable. It has one unlikable character after another. The performances are obnoxious. I've been watching a lot of Clint lately so i decided to give this movie another shot. I shouldn't have bothered. ""Jersey Boys"" is the pits. It's probably the most annoying movie I have ever seen. Clint really dropped the ball with this one."
" Oh, What a Night.
",2020-01-18 00:00:00,6,"Clint Eastwood and show-tunes. Who would have thought? Jersey Boys came and went in 2014. It's one of the lost films of the 2010's. Was it because it was so bad? It's not that bad. It's like a cross between Dreamgirls and A Bronx Tale. The music is fantastic, as you'd expect. The storyline, while corny and a bit disheveled in tone, is easy to follow and hits right home when it needs to. Hearing Frankie Valli's ""My Eye's Adored You"" at his daughter's funeral left me with a lump in my throat. That's a powerful moment that needed it's one-two punch for viewers, and thankfully, we get that. My biggest issue is it's acting. At times, the boys are way over the top. The climax in particular is a treasure trove of embarrassingly bad acting. It's not a masterpiece, but it's a nice little movie."
" Not quite what I expected
",2020-01-05 00:00:00,4,"As a biographical drama, Jersey Boys is well written and well acted. But as a biographical musical it leaves much to be desired. It would be more pleasing to the ear if the vocal and instrumental soundtracks had been more nearly true to original quality of the Four Seasons."
" Can't keep my eyes on you
",2020-01-02 00:00:00,2,"Wow...what slop. How can anyone give this a 10. I like The 4 Seasons music and love Frankie's voice but holy cow is this garbage.
Corny as corny can be. If this story is actually true this could've been a gold mine. But it's rushed, trite, and seems so disconnected.
Band is a nobody..bam Joe Pesci connects Frankie with his writing partner...bam they are superstars...bam Frank's kids are almost teenagers .....wait wait he has kids. Oh we skipped past that to the band fighting. I mean this would draw some emotion if we cared about their relationship. Which the movie doesn't give you time to do. It's too busy trying to give you goosebumps listening to one hit after another. Who cares? It's now become a side note to the drama and the bands tension.
Then we go about 40 minutes with no music at all...please keep your eyes open and off your cell phones playing games out of boredom and stay riveted to bad acting and overly dramatic script.
Let's throw in a 2 minute relationship with a family member and her untimely death to try and invoke some emotion that may have cowered into your bored mind. Oh she died..so sad...next scene...action.
God it's so bad. And what surprised me the most was Clint Eastwood directed this Path train wreck."
" I've see it multiple times!
",2019-10-16 00:00:00,10,"Ok, i am biased. I am a musician and that's basically what the movie is about.
The acting is great! Who knew that V Piazza ( a bit player in 2 sopranos episodes) could carry a film so well!
Love this film."
" Enjoyed the entire movie
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,8,Although the first half of the movie sort of drags The balance of the movie was quite entertaining and informative about the groups up & downs. The over fifty crowd will enjoy a look back one of the most successful groups in music of all time. I enjoyed it very much.
" Major Letdown
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,3,The screenplay is cliched and overall poorly written. The acting is second rate. I expected much more and this is big letdown. I grew up during this era and loved the music. But the movie dropped the ball.
" Boring
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,3,Way too long with bad acting and writing. Forced myself to the halfway point and cut my losses.
" Oh My Gosh!
",2019-01-22 00:00:00,4,"It was an Hour tooooooooooooo long! So many scenes could be deleted or taken out and make this movie a little more real or less boringgggggggggg. If you like the music it's ok. Husband liked the music and the fact its based on events about the group.
But it so bloody long and their voices were shrill (high) to boot! However, they did do their own singing and lip synced to it.
The narrating by cast members was so distracting and odd really took from the movie as well. Their A-Typical West Side Story bad boy ""acting"" at the beginning was way over done! I just really did not like the movie at all."
" I Loved the 4 Seasons -- the Movie is a Disaster
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,4,"Before I go into why I disliked this film, let me say that I was, and still am, a big fan of the 4 Seasons. I collected everything they did together up until 1970. This film does no justice to who they were, where they came from or how they sounded. The dude playing Valli is actually embarrassing to listen to. He sounds more like Jerry Lewis than Frankie Valli. The others are mere caricatures, and out of their league as far as acting is concerned.The songs are NOTHING like they ought to sound, and so grating to listen to that the whole mess should have been dubbed. Historically speaking, I have to ask, was there anyone during this fiasco of a production that had ever heard of continuity? For instance, near the beginning when the setting is the VERY early 1950s, a girl complains she wants to go to the movies to see The Blob, which didn't come out until 1958. And that's just the beginning. ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" is presented as being introduced in 1970 when it actually was a monster hit in 1967. And when I heard Valli singing ""My Eyes Adored You"" to his little girl, I want to scream. It was way out of sync with the timeline, and in fact came out AFTER Can't Take My Eyes Off You.Eastwood's directing on this turkey is wooden, as though he phoned his direction in while he stayed in bed. In short, if you truly loved the music of The Four Seasons, avoid this mish-mash of a movie."
" Great adaptation
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,10,"For fans of the broadway show, like myself, it's good to know that you can keep the story at the heart of it with the music as a garnish. For the show, the music is more to the max. I think this movie was exactly what it needed to be. Especially with Eastwood's raw directing style it compliments the actors and everything so well."
" Not really like the stage musical, but still good.
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,7,"This movie is more of a drama than a musical biopic, but it still works. It's hard to figure out how much Eastwood kept to the original script or actual facts. However, the casting and performances are brilliant. John Lloyd Young as Frankie Valli shines and he is a joy to watch."
" Great for music fanatics; good enjoyable film for others.
",2018-12-24 00:00:00,6,"A film based on the rock and roll musical band of the 60s- Jersey Boys has a great pace to it, with the iconic music of Frankie Valli and the era woven in appropriately and well. Where Eastwood falls short however, is in his creation of female characters. Characters that are initially extremely strong and seem to be a large part of Frankie's early life seem to disappear, reappearing only as plot devices. Other female characters that are supposedly to have a large impact on Valli's life (as told through the narration) debut and disappear as well, living out their time on the screen only as background characters that suddenly make impacts on the plot that are larger than the emotional investment that they solicit from the viewer. If you like musicals this is for you. If you have seen the play and know what to expect you will get more. Credit goes to Clint Eastwood for taking the play and adding cinematic elements to take the story to a higher level. The muted cinematography and editing are noteworthy."
" If you've ever wanted to hear a bunch of men sing like little girls...
",2018-12-21 00:00:00,1,"...then this is the movie for you! Honestly, if I wanted to hear young men with voices ready to crack crystal I'd go to a castration."
" Don't believe the hype
",2018-12-05 00:00:00,6,"I'm perfectly willing to admit that I may be wrong. I've never seen Frankie Valli live. but it seems to me that the movie totally missed the essence of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. I always felt that, whatever flaws were in their singing voices was more than made up for by the absolute joy and feeling in their performances. In the movie, the was a noticeable lack of any feeling in the music. Add that to a choppy story lacking any sense of timing, and Jersey Boys is a pretty mediocre movie."
" MY EYES ADORED YOU
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,9,"This is the story of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons from Frankie working in a Barber Shop to their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. John Lloyd Young of ""Glee"" captures the unique Valli voice. The film at times fells like a ""greatest hits"" album as it shows the difficult relationships within the band and with elements of the mob. Band member Tommy Devito (Vincent Piazza) became the antagonist in the film while Bob Guadio (Erich Bergen) was the song writer who tailored his songs for Frankie.My only criticism would be the fictionalized nature of the dialogue for dramatic effect...which is not necessarily a bad thing. Bravo Clint on a good production.Parental Guide: F-bombs (The title has Jersey in it). No nudity. Implied sex."
" clint eastwood goes musical
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,10,Review: I normally don't like musicals because I find the singing and dancing takes away from the movie for me. This is one of the few exemptions due to being balanced out by a great production team. The direction and screenplay are both really good. The costume and set are really good and truly feel like you are back during the formation of the four seasons in the 1950's to their peak of fame in the 1960's. The camera crew does an incredible job using methods like pan shots. The casting and acting is incredible also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Movie about a band
",2018-10-18 00:00:00,6,"Jersey Boys is a story about this four guys. This is definitely a Clint Eastwood movie that has a ok script. Eastwood makes the movie live, but there is something that doesn't go with it. The actors are ok, the way that the movie is shot is ok and everything else is ok. I just didn't find it that interesting as a movie."
" Good Story/Average Singing
",2018-09-09 00:00:00,7,"The film was entertaining, but the lead actor's singing could not compete, in any way, with Frankie Valli's voice. instead of singing close to Franki Valli's inimitable falsetto, his voice sounded, at times, nasal, thin, and hoarse. Every time he sang, I kept wishing that the film had used Frankie Valli's voice instead."
" ""Walk like a man""...Away from this
",2018-09-01 00:00:00,3,"Meh. That's about all I can say. This had a lot of potential but it ended up being like a cross between a made for TV movie and a high school production. Maybe it was Clint Eastwood or maybe it was too much material to cover or maybe the leads just couldn't carry the movie. There were a lot of issues and in the end it looked really cobbled together and when it ended I wasn't invested in what happened to any of them. Maybe the movie could have been better had CE just picked one time period of Frankie's life instead of trying to fit all of it into one movie. The lead actor was too wooden and reserved to carry this. In a word he was boring. He was too short to the point of distraction and his butt chin and slightly crossed eyes just kept taking me out of the story line. He looked like a cross between Mario Lopez and Herve Villechaize. Plus they didn't do a very good job in the makeup department with him because he never aged. Even when he was supposed to be older he just looked like a high school production's idea of how to age someone. The Bob Gaudio actor was pretty good. He looked like a cross between Tate Donovan, Steve Buscemi & Chris Klein.It's sweet that Clint wants to put one of his 20 kids in his film which is good for Francesca Eastwood because she can't act. Even in this small ass throwaway forgettable role she managed to be unforgettably awful. Famous father does not a good actress make. She needs to go into another line of work. She'd be getting no roles if it wasn't for Daddy.Other than those highlights there's nothing here worth watching. ""Oh what a night""...this wasn't."
" One of my fave movies of all time. Heavily underrated
",2018-05-24 00:00:00,10,"This movie is literally the musical theatre production on the big screen. With amazing vocals by John Lloyd Young and a story which you feel the highs and lows, this movie is definitely for someone who wants to discover good music or have a sing and a dance. This movIe changed my music taste completely 10/10"
" It just glosses over the events with a Hollywood sheen that wears thin fast.
",2018-05-01 00:00:00,4,"'Jersey Boys (2014)' never really gives you an insight into the minds of the men behind the music. It never gives you a sense of their passion for the craft or how their songs are a product of their environment. It never even conveys an appropriate sense of impact or escalation to the events that lead to the group's eventual downfall. Instead, it uses its time to gloss by the big hits and early beginnings in a boringly check-list fashion, with only a surface level of depth and a Hollywood sheen that wears thin fast. It doesn't help that, even though there are some undoubtable classics in their repertoire, the group's high-pitched lead vocal eventually becomes whiny and annoying when listening to it for two-hours as opposed to three-minutes on a record. The odd fourth-wall breaking asides switch perspectives too often to feel like anything more than expositional crutches, that are surely a by-product of lazy writing, too. The feature as a whole feels like it lacks a proper structure, never coming to a head with a true final act and finishing in almost the exact way that it started. It actually feels more like a TV-special than a bona fide feature. A poor effort from Eastwood. 4/10"
" Clint Eastwood Needs To Retire From Directing
",2018-03-12 00:00:00,1,"Prior to watching ""The Jersey Boys"" - I had actually liked the music of The Four Seasons - But, now - (Thanks to Clint Eastwood's bungling, amateurish direction) - I hate The Four Seasons, big-time (and I hope that I never hear any of their songs ever again).Yep. This petty, snivelling ""bio"" picture clearly proves to me (beyond a shadow of a doubt) that, as a director, Clint Eastwood (who's now pushing 90) is nothing but a senile, old boob who seriously needs to retire, ASAP - (Like, hasn't this greedy bugger got enough money and fan-admiration to do him for the rest of his days?)From start to finish - ""The Jersey Boys"" (at an unbearable 2 hours/15 minutes) had such a noticeable slap/dash feel about it, that I swear they were making this nonsense up as they went along.P.S. - I really cringe and shudder to think of what incompetent movie-project that that clueless, doddering twit, Eastwood has planned next to foist onto the gullible movie-going public."
" Jersey Boys works as a drama, but as a musical it fails.
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,6,"A slight misfire from Clint Eastwood who has directed some excellent films. Don't get me wrong, this was incredibly watchable...just uninspired. Based on the life of Frankie Valli, it is the story on how the rock band 'The Four Seasons' formed. Whilst dabbling in the rise and fall of band member Tommy DeVito, but primarily focused on Frankie. As with most biopics, it is the typical tale of how fame and fortune can corrupt the mind and alter your motives. In this case, this is conveyed through Tommy DeVito who founded the band. But as their popularity increases, his aspirations in life change which may not be for the betterment of the group. The dramatic traits that are embedded into the narrative just work well. The members were emotionally involving and incredibly acted. Considering the majority of the cast were newcomers, it worked in Eastwood's favour. Plus, John Lloyd Young is a revelation. An absurdly talented actor. Eastwood's direction was solid once again as he incorporates some fresh ideas, including letting the characters look at the camera and directly address the audience. I do wish certain aspects of Valli's life were explored more deeply, particularly the death of his daughter. Should've made more of an impact, but instead seemed to have been brushed away as soon as it happens. Then we come to the musical aspect, which just doesn't work. It's not electrifying. It's not uplifting. It's just there. The only time it works is at the end where they are singing in the street. That is what a musical is about! If you are using real songs from a real band, make it the main attraction! Get me standing up and singing the lyrics from the top of my lungs...sadly, it's not executed in that way. So the drama isn't powerful, and the musicality isn't exciting. Watchable, but not very memorable."
" Why the bad reviews for such a good movie?
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,8,"Oh what movie. See what I did there. One of The Four Seasons best songs and a nice play on words with it. But yes, this is a good movie. I don't know why it rated so low on IMDb. So here we go to the review.Synopsis: Jersey Boys is a musical biography of the Four Seasons-the rise, the tough times and personal clashes, and the ultimate triumph of a group of friends whose music became symbolic of a generation. Far from a mere tribute concert (though it does include numbers from the popular Four Seasons songbook), Jersey Boys gets to the heart of the relationships at the center of the group-with a special focus on frontman Frankie Valli, the small kid with the big falsetto. In addition to following the quartet's coming of age as performers, the core of the show is how an allegiance to a code of honor learned in the streets of their native New Jersey got them through a multitude of challenges: gambling debts, Mafia threats and family disasters. Jersey Boys is a glimpse at the people behind a sound that has managed to endure for over four decades in the hearts of the public. Starring: John Lloyd Young, Vincent Piazza, Michael Lomenda, Erich Bergen Director: Clint EastwoodClint Eastwood proves yet again why he should never stop making movies. He is a brilliant, brilliant film maker. Just look at the history of this man. He has proved time and again that he is the man who should be asked in the top five directors first to direct a movie. This being his first musical was not a bad venture.One great thing that Clint did was cast people who acted in the musical to begin with. That did nothing but help this movie. The guys who were playing the roles of the Four Seasons played them before, so they knew the material. They already had it in their heads how it should go.I found out throughout the years that most people didn't know that the four guys were connected to the mob in more ways than one. At first, I didn't believe it. Then I looked into the matter. And if it wasn't for the mob, a lot of the musicians out of Jersey wouldn't have gotten any farther than they had. I'm glad that they left that part in. It really is an intricate part to the story.The last thing I need to talk about is the soundtrack. I mentioned it earlier, but these guys singing sounded almost like the real singers. The soundtrack is not the best part, but it is very close to it. Just for the fact of the soundtrack is enough to watch this movie.I strongly encourage everyone to watch this movie. Just give it a try, it will surprise you.Rating: 8 out of 10"
" In Spite of All the Odds, A Solid Film
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,7,"When I think of New Jersey -- I think Clint Eastwood. When I think of Italians -- I think Clint Eastwood. And when I think of rock and roll -- I think Clint Eastwood. Even with all the obvious handicaps, I was amazed at what an effective movie this was. I was expecting the actors to lip-synch to the actual Four Seasons classics, but instead they do all their own singing (and dancing.) The results aren't always spectacular, but they're always entertaining. I loved the way the movie didn't shy away from the darker side of the Four Seasons' story. (""I just buried a child, Jimmy. I don't want to sing another love song."") I was also pleasantly surprised that one of the key men behind the Four Seasons' musical success was openly gay and was treated with respect by both the screenplay and the other characters. Maybe the biggest surprise for me was how effectively Vincent Piazza adds humor and warmth to the tough as nails Italian gangster type he played so brilliantly for five years on HBO's BOARDWALK EMPIRE. My hand to God, this movie was the best rock and roll musical ever produced by Clint Eastwood -- especially the big song and dance number over the closing credits!"
