" 4 stars fir main 2 cast, 0 for everything else
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,4,"You could not have wasted a more potential masterpiece than whatever the f had happened here.To coin the Buzz Lightyear meme:
""Templates.... Templates everywhere!""
Stock everything. It may as well have been compiled by things you can buy in ikea.What a disappointmentAt least Alba and Hensen out on a good show."
" I really enjoyed this!!
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,8,Don't know why there are so many bad reviews??? Just came across this on Netflix and really enjoyed it. Great twist and good acting. Seems some people put bad reviews on without actually watching it or finishing a film.
" A suitably entertaining flick
",2021-03-18 00:00:00,7,"I thoroughly enjoyed 'No Good Deed'.Sure it isn't anything incredible and is rather simple, but it delivers on action and brings tension. It also features very good performances Idris Elba (Colin) - somewhat iffy accent aside - and Taraji P. Henson (Terri) - two actors I enjoy. The plot is simple but it's executed well, it doesn't even have the chance to drag either due to the short 83 minute run time.Not much more to note. A suitably entertaining flick from 2014 by Sam Miller, who also directed Elba in the outstanding television series 'Luther'."
" Does the job!
",2021-03-17 00:00:00,6,"There are a lot of negative reviews on this film so I have to admit I wasn't expecting much. I mostly decided to watch it because Idris was in it!
Having watched it I was really pleasantly surprised. It was an entertaining, not too long, well acted, thriller. Just what I was looking for on a film night. The ending wasn't too much of a twist but it was by no means obvious from the outset and I didn't get bored at any point in the film.
Idris played the villain just right, you never could quite tell if he was going to completely flip or not. The leading lady was fantastic and it was great to see the victim role not being portrayed so helplessly as it is in other films."
" Stupid on all levels
",2021-03-16 00:00:00,1,"What possessed Idris Elba to continue sleepwalking though his role without screaming at the director/producer/screenwriter 'Enough. I'm out of here'?This has the dumbest plot imaginable and the characters seem to freeze whenever they're asked to speak with each other because their ability to act/interact like normal human beings is zero. These lingering silences are meant to create tension, but they make everyone look like they forgot whose line comes up next.The female lead is meant to be an attorney yet has the common sense of a turnip and her fixed expression of helplessness soon tires. When confronted by an armed cop who asks if she's OK, she stares like a rabbit in the headlights for about 3 minutes before saying yes (after flashing her lights at him for assistance in the first place).My oh my - how can anyone justify making a buck from this crud? It's an insult to the intelligence of its intended audience and the cast. This good deed deserves an universal thumbs down"
" No Good Camerawork
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,1,How can anyone even stomach watching this the camera work is shaky af and sometimes you can't even see what's happened
" Why didn't this work?
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,6,"This had the potential but I came away with nothing really, but I don't know why.... something was missing with this film."
" Utter cringe
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,1,"It's a known fact that women open doors to total stranger in the middle of the night. The way the blonde woman behaves is like ""with"".... who behaves like that?"
" Couldn't watch it all
",2021-03-08 00:00:00,3,"It's absolutely silly because she lets the stranger in her home like who even does that. And then before that u got the guard coming up close to the prisoner giving a tissue which then the prisoner attacked the guard, they should of made this film more realistically. After the scene where she lets him inside her home I stopped watching it. Thumbs down for me."
" Bad choice
",2021-03-05 00:00:00,3,"Let's be honest, guys admitting they only watched this because their partner wanted to, we know the reason, because there's a certain black actor in it, think you need to pay more attention to your partners. Or get new ones. Because if they like this movie then you really have it bad. It felt like listening to the Mrs for two hours or listening to colleagues. It's long winded, meaningless, ridiculous and really badly executed by Idris and the others."
" Frustrating
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,4,One of those frustrating films where everything happens that wouldn't normally happen and things just happen for the sake of it.
" Brilliant Thriller
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,10,"A brilliant thriller, good acting, great film score, rewatchable.
However, quite unrealistic as a DA should and would know better than to let a complete stranger in her house just to wait for the tow services regardless that it's pouring down with rain, he even said that she did not have to let him in, but if she did not let him in there would be no movie.
It seems ambiguous as to what ""Colin's"" plan was, by the timeline of this film along with the flashback near the end - he went to the house to kill the guy that was sleeping with Colin's ex (but in Colin's mind, she was still his girlfriend or something, even though she never once visited him in prison and did not even open any of his letters, but he is a psychopath or sociopath and has a warped mind) but ""Terry"" opened the door and ""Colin"" played things by ear while still planning to confront her husband, but then things spiralled out of control, and I think near the end of the movie he was gonna get ""Terry"" to call her husband and then he was going to kill the husband when he gets to the house and maybe kill Terry too.No Good Deed - Good movie title, Brilliant Thriller."
" Nothing special, but better than expected.
",2021-02-23 00:00:00,5,"While this wasn't anything special, it definitely wasn't as bad as I expected it to be.
The leads do an excellent job in their respective roles, which is coupled nicely with solid writing. The first act is nothing to write home about, and the movie felt like it was dragging towards the end, it was still relatively entertaining.
All in all, a pretty standard cat/and-mouse tale, decent to throw on for movie night."
" A protagonist that it is impossible to root for
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,5,"Whoever wrote this does not know how to write female or male characters. That, or this person really thinks quite lowly of women. All the women in this movie are unintelligent, nags, over-sexualized teases, weak, and liars who don't respect men. I don't think the makers were intending to make some general comment on gender. I think this is just people who don't know how to write good characters, so they rely on weak stereotypes. Even the men are huge idiots. Every character is too stupid to be real. In general, if you are too stupid to know how to stop your own car alarm (put the keys in the ignition,) you are likely too stupid to pull off, let alone survive a home-invasion.
The beginning of the movie sets up Elba's character well enough, but after that initial scene, everything is downhill. The first half of the movie is just more set-up, and it is excruciating in how stupid it is. The protagonist doesn't just make bad choices. She ceases to act like a human woman. She lacks any boundaries or general aptitudes.
By the time anything happens, you can't stand the protagonist, and the antagonist is a cartoon villain. All he was missing was a long mustache to twirl, and a set of train tracks to tie Henson to.
Overall, too predictable to enjoy, with characters too stupid to ever want to encounter again. Well-shot, with a not-bad soundtrack, but oh so dumb. Skip this one. Catch this cast in something else."
" Violating Common Sense Rules
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,6,"Idris Elba and Taraji P. Henson will get me to watch just about any movie, even if it is on Lifetime.When an extremely violent and temperamental man named Collin (Elba) broke free from prison transport over the dead bodies of two guards, he went to pay his ex-girlfriend Alexis (Kate del Castillo) a visit in Atlanta. Alexis had moved on from her psycho ex-boyfriend and Collin wasn't the least bit pleased about that. One strangled girlfriend later and he was on the move again until his vehicle crashed. He then wound up at the door of Terry (Henson) seemingly in need of a phone and some first-aid.At this point Terry violated just about every common sense rule imaginable. She didn't use the peephole to see who was knocking at her door. Hello! That's what peepholes are for! She gave Collin her phone to use instead of sending him up the road (which is especially weird in the age of cell phones). She left her door ajar when she went to check on the kids. And even though Collin never entered the house then, she eventually invited him in. In other words, she invited danger into her home.That's not to say Terry deserved all of what came afterwards, just to say, ""Woman! You gotta be smarter than that!""The movie took a little too long to develop. It was established early that Collin was 5150, but once he got to Terry's door it lulled. We didn't know his reason for being there nor what he planned to do to her even though we knew she was going to be the target of his insanity. The end had a nice twist to it that brought some redeeming value, I just think the movie could've been more exciting throughout."
" Thank Goodness for Good Actors
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,7,"The movie is good, but seems too unrealistic. This woman lets a stranger enter her home in the middle of the night. Then she steps out of the house while he is in there with her children while she tries to turn off the car alarm. She seems unusually, very comfortable with this strange man in her home, leaving him in a room by himself. WHO DOES THIS?!!!!! Nobody. That's who. I give credit to Taraji P Henson, Leslie Bibb, and Idris Elba for making the movie watchable. But the script could have been written better"
" 5.5 imdb review is right for once
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,6,"Lots of movies identical to this.
husband goes away for a few days, leaves wife and kids at home.
convict escapes from jail, kidnap and house invasion.run of the mill thriller, good acting and good story.
not bad, but nothing special.i gave it 6 rather than 5 because of idris elba's portrayal of a bad guy was very good"
" A damn fine home-invasion movie.
",2020-06-23 00:00:00,7,"My Rating : 7/10Found this thanks to Malcolm Gladwell's 'Revisionist History' podcast and him discussing the plot of the movie and the possible actions by the main characters. I watched it and found it to be thought-provoking having listened to the podcast which goes much more in-depth and explores various philosophical schools of thought, rational vs ethical for example.'No Good Deed' is fast-paced, engaging and right out of a thriller novel. Highly recommended."
" Good movie (No Good Deed)
",2020-06-13 00:00:00,6,"In the beginning the movie is interesting, but happens everything what happen in all the movies, the ""good girl"" always make mistakes to scape.Spoiler:
For three or four times Terry try to hit Colin, but she always give only one ""blow"".
And what happen? Colin start to pursuit her again, classic scene..."
" Could have been better
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,7,"Truly not a,bad movie...Everybody involved emojis very well ,Knowles proves again that she is tolerable at an actress and is improving has this plot been done again a 100 times yes but this particular movie is what it is because of the Mania that is beyonce Knowles . Plot this fairly simple well-to-do couple make it to the top by a new house half baked woman falls madly in lust 4 husband wife kicks her a** and she dies in the end. A lot of provisions and time and effort were made for this movie to be it seems that a lot of key scenes were cut out to help us understand 1st of all why the half baked temp became obsessed to begin with .....larter is fetching......But hardly scary....Never the less a popcorn movie and not a bad way to spend 2 hours"
" Aye
",2019-10-29 00:00:00,10,"One of my favorite movies they need to make another one to this and to the perfect guy, acrimony, and break in love these movies"
" Started very well
",2019-09-09 00:00:00,2,"No spoilers.no worries.It started well. I would suggest however that the writer remain original,meaning unpredictable yet believable."
" Horrifying...but..!
",2019-08-15 00:00:00,7,Good movie...tension all along!! Idris is really good!! But.. like in other movies ..do women has to be stupid first to get powerful later? ..I don't think so.
" Had to turn it off after 20 mins
",2019-07-16 00:00:00,1,I can't believe Elba has done such a shocker of a film.I couldn't watch more than 20 minutes. Utter ham.Avoid.
" Good suspense movie
",2019-03-26 00:00:00,7,"I'm not sure why this has so many bad reviews, I honestly liked it and I'm usually super critical of suspense movies because it's my favorite genre. It's definitely not the best movie out there, but if you're looking for a casual suspense/thriller for the night, check it out."
" HONEY, I'M HOME
",2018-12-18 00:00:00,4,"Colin Evans (Idris Elba) convicted of manslaughter did not get his parole because he is a psychopathic Narcissist. He does manage to escape into the poorly developed subplot of housewife Terri (Taraji P. Henson) and former DA. Her husband is gone. Colin has anger management and hydroplaning issues as he expectantly glides into the house of Terri, as we await the home hostage plot to kick-in...something that took way too long.Terri is no shrinking violet and goes ""Ray Rice"" all over her captor with formulaic results.The film takes place in the Atlanta area. There was nothing really different to the formula other than that the main cast is African-American, proving that you don't have to be white to make an unoriginal film.Parental Guidance: F-bomb. No sex or nudity"
" Pretty good ""B"" Movie material. Entertaining
",2018-08-23 00:00:00,6,"This is why ""suspense"" and scary movies are made. Elba does a fine job as a ""malignant narcissist"" who has to control women...and Taraji Henson is pretty good as the woman he is bent on dominating.Kind of like a ""hostage"" story that moves around to different scenes...good stuff."
" Better than I expected
",2018-07-09 00:00:00,8,I wanted to watch this film after listening to a Malcom Gladwell podcast in which he references the movie. I saw the ratings were poor but I watched it anyway and was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. There is a surprise twist at the end I did not see coming!
" Watchable or missable, you choose!
",2018-04-07 00:00:00,5,Oh Idris! From the brilliance of Luther to the very forgettable No good deed. It's watchable at best.
" So bad it's kind of good
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,4,I've watched a small number of worse movies than this one. Its ridiculous twist finally drains it's rapidly ebbing energy. There are a number of almost tense scenes and glimpses of good acting. These are book ended by some extremely fun filled moments of unintended hilarity. I haven't seen so many clichés stuffed into 90 minutes in quite a while. It's like watching jaws 5. The two main actors do their best but I sense their mounting desperation is a reaction to their dawning realisation the movie is a giant turkey. I did watch it all though!
" Edge-of-the-seat suspense crime thriller!
",2018-02-06 00:00:00,8,"No Good Deed is an edge-of-the-seat suspense crime thriller! You will not be able to get up when you are watching this movie (although to be frank, there is nothing NEW in the story)!NOTE: Don't believe some stupid people who think the movie is Boring!The director, Sam Miller, has done a mature job of maintaining the aura of suspense in each and every scene. The Background Music and the slow Pace of the film, all contribute to transfixing the minds of the audience to the screen. In fact, I prefer this more than any noisy, rapidly-edited & fast-faced suspense movies.The Screenplay is Tight and Crispy!The Acting is very, very decent. But Idris Elba looks slightly friendly to be a heartless killer. Perhaps a beard, Hoodie and a wicked gaze would have done the trick.I won't say anything more for fear of giving away details of the movie (esp. a small twist towards the end). Just watch this Short, Simple and Suspense-ridden film in any movie channel of your choice."
" A good, old-fashioned psycho thriller
",2017-12-21 00:00:00,6,"NO GOOD DEED is a fun little throwback to the type of psycho thrillers that were all the rage in the early 1990s. It's essentially a two-hander between Idris Elba's escaped convict and Taraji P. Henson's suburban mother. Elba is a long-established screen presence and it's no surprise to find that he's very good in his role here, bringing a kind of physical domination and burning intensity to the part; it says something that he's more than just a one-dimensional bad guy. I have no idea who Henson is but she acquits herself with the sympathetic role well. The budget is clearly low but the violent events are staged with relish and there's a good helping of suspense to boot."
" Generic but Enjoyable for Cheap Thrills
",2017-11-29 00:00:00,5,"What do you expect from a run-of-the-mill crazed criminal terrorizes an innocent woman? Not much I would hope, but there is some decent thrills to be had if one turns off the overly analytical part of the brain.Idris Elba delivers a solid performance as psychopathic killer Colin Evans, the film's antagonist. Elba uses subtle menace and his husky vocals (convincing American accent included) to convey the evil within Colin instead of being a caricature of an over-the-top madman. The actor also makes his violent actions erupt like a volcano rather than methodically killing his prey; Colin kills in fits of rage than planning out his deeds, but his mind games are planned methods of psychological torture and threats of harm. Too bad the actor's ultimate demise is generic with the plot of a home invasion film like 'The Hand that Rocks the Cradle'.Actress Taraji P. Henson also delivers solid work as the film's heroine, Terry. Henson comes across as the typical bored housewife who gave up her dreams to raise her kids and longs for excitement in her life. However Terry's world is turned upside down when Colin shows up and she is initially not too suspicious of her guest. However Colin's behavior soon unnerves her and Terry doesn't hesitate to start acting on removing him from her home. Henson does not become a stereotypical damsel in distress as she combatively attacks Elba's Colin and is able to protect herself throughout the chase scenes and of course triumphs in the end.The film's script is generic for a thriller of the home invasion genre with the psychotic killer, innocent homeowner on her own and of course plenty of killings and chases. The film does contain some genuine tension and some jump scares. The chemistry between the leads is believable as the tension mounts and you wonder how Henson's Terry will escape and Elba's menace spooks the viewer as much as Terry."
" Lost me from the very start... Smh
",2017-07-05 00:00:00,3,Considering the crime idris Elba's character is accused of and the fact taraji Henson's husband is a lawyer I find it ridiculous she didn't recognize him. There had to be news coverage considering the heinous aspects of the accusation. Glaringly stupid fact that RUINED THE MOVIE. Ms Henson is a incredibly beautiful actress I'm sorry this movie is so intellectually insulting.
