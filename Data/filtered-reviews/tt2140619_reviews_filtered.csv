" Boring.. unlikeable characters.
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,2,Snore. Sooooo boring. The characters are not lovable. They don't seem to fit/ go together. You just want the snow to melt so the movie can end!!! ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ I may not even watch the rest. I'm so bored I had to look what others thought of it !!! I'm shocked. This movie is a waste of time big time. !!!
" Watch a different rom-com
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,2,"My girlfriend and I are admittedly into rom-coms, so it's always a laborious task to find one we don't think will be too corny or clichÃ©. Thought Two Night Stand would meet that criteria, but sadly we were wrong.This is a poorly acted flick with no dimension or real surprises. Tipton and Teller lack chemistry and a lot of the jokes don't land. There are many other options in this genre -- even the ""dating app"" rom-com genre -- that are more worthy of your time."
" A light-hearted rom-com
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,6,"The plot is not so unique for this type of film, but that's how the story is told, in ways that are charming and fun. The cast helped a lot, Analeigh Tipton and Miles Tiller have a good chemistry and carrie the movie well. The dialogue is decent and there's some truth in it. Throughout the drama features a beautiful morality about true love and in its purest form. The soundtrack is good as is the cinematography."
" Snowedin
",2020-09-19 00:00:00,6,"Another take on the much advised Rom com...
This one's mildly amusing and the best one can say for this is that it's not a total washout.
The leads are serviceable and the dialog rarely flags. The situations are corny but it manages to go down ok. The plot does play fast and loose with devices but if you're willing to let go you might even enjoy it."
" Super underrated
",2020-09-18 00:00:00,8,"It's a great movie and do not go for the name, the movie actually have emotions in it! It's a short and cute one to watch in a blanket with a cup of warm chocolate.
The acting is also above average!"
" Watchable but very predictable
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,4,"Just seemed really predictable. Yes, it's a movie, but there's just so much unrealistic-ness with the plot. Very cliche love story. Probably the best part of the movie was Megan finally opening up to Alec about her college years. That's about it."
" Cute, sweet, witty! Fans of Miles will enjoy
",2020-02-16 00:00:00,9,"Late to game on this movie, but if you're scrolling through Prime video and like Miles Teller, this is worth a watch. Witty, charming, good chemistry between the characters. Nothing monumental happens, it's just a basic night of two young people meeting and getting to know each other. The dialogue flowed and wasn't corny, felt pretty true to life. Found myself wishing for my own snow day with someone fun. If you like Miles Teller and his sense of humor or if you like cute romantic comedies, check this one out!"
" All snowed in
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,7,Surprisingly entertaining but still a pretty standard rom-com
" FUNNY, DIFFERENT AND FRESH AS A LETTUCE
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,9,"This movie made me feel young and happy. It's so funny and refreshing (in a weird way) and the script, dialogues and performances were just amazing."
" Amazing
",2019-12-29 00:00:00,10,Such a good movie that I've seen in a while. It made me laugh and cry at the same time :)
" Sweet Movie
",2019-11-30 00:00:00,7,"I really like these types of movies. Claustrophobic movies really speak to me. Here it's in the form of a one night stand extending into the next day because of a snowstorm. Really intriguing to see the way two strangers who are attracted to each other sexually at least, end up becoming lovers. And it's funny and twenties silly.I basically explained the plot. Miles Teller does a good job, and the actress is good too. It's a really sweet movie, and one of those gems you're glad you came by one random day.7 stars"
" There were some funny moments.
",2019-09-14 00:00:00,5,"Some. LOL moments and lines. But there were also a lot of lines that were supposed to be funny and for me they fell worse than totally flat.For most of the movie, Megan was a lazy loser and a witch. As a result, who would care if she actually connects with someone. In fact, for any guy's sake, you would hope she doesn't. Alec sure deserved more given the explanation for what he did.The toilet humor early on was a complete turn off and that stuff leaves a smell which wouldn't go away easily, so how romantic!One stupid situation led to another and they were not funny, but again there were some more or less funny ones in between."
" My favourite movie
",2019-09-13 00:00:00,10,"I LOVED this, so sweet and funny and just a perfect Friday night movie"
" Talking chemistry in the couple shown is excellent
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,7,One night stand is the well known titled and we all know its fun limitations and pass it on affair. Here director knits the thread of romance alive by typical script and wonderful screen play and dialogues. The accidentally meeting for a night and forbidden romantically in snow is the cue used and explored to really really nice level.Fun Comedy Romance a little melodrama and the finest use of a plunger for toilet usage explored. Couple develops chemistry very gradually though they are meeting each other for the first time through networks..
" The Return of John Cussack
",2019-07-12 00:00:00,7,"I guess my age is showing, but Miles Teller's character was made to order for the young John Cussack, and I kept having flashbacks of Cussack movies. I'm sure that sounds derogatory toward Teller, but that's not my intent. I liked Teller in the movie, and the comparison to Cussack is not a slander by any means.Some might argue that the plot was predictable, but if you like these kind of movies (and I do), you don't watch them for unusual plot twists. You want to care about the characters, and you want to see who they are (and who they might become). In that way, this movie was very satisfying. They slowly reveal those little details that make them real for us. Of course, you could say that the chances of two lost/semi-lost characters finding each other in a city as big as New York is stretching credibility, but so what? We don't have to start calculating the odds of such a thing happening; we can just enjoy the collision.I also liked Analeigh Tipton, although it wasn't easy to imagine someone that attractive living a lonely and forlorn existence. Megan is quirky and moody, but she can still blossom spectacularly, given the right circumstances, and we get to watch it happen.It's a fun movie, well worth your time."
" IT'S ALEC, RIGHT?
",2019-06-24 00:00:00,6,"This is a formulaic romantic comedy. Meagan (Analeigh Tipton) is in a lethargic limbo stage after breaking up with Chris. She is ""horny and lazy."" Urged on by her roommate (Jessica Szohr) she is coaxed into a one night stand via Internet. She meets Alec (not Alex-Miles Teller) a likeable, funny, well adjusted bank manager assistant.Meagan attempts to sneak out but is foiled by a combination of his door alarm and an unexpected blizzard. Their morning goes from openly hostile to each other, to lets deal with the situation. The two decide to be brutally honest with each other about sex, but the script waters that down too. They must come to terms with their life, life in general, etc. It is all about communication and snuggling after sex... all stuff that we have seen over and over again in these romantic comedies, of which some people can't get enough.The film tries to be funny, but I found it only mildly humorous. The characters are cookie-cut mix and match romantic comedy types. While there was nothing wrong with the performances, the script had that been there, done that, got the T-shirt feel it it.Makes for an okay rental for those who like romantic comedies without any Puffs moments.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, Analeigh Tipton (or body double) butt nudity."
" This is actually such a charmer!
",2019-05-12 00:00:00,7,"This was such an unexpected charming little love story. Both actors really owned it too. Super cute, definitely worth watching!"
" Loved this!
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,10,"Such a sweet and light hearted rom com, perfect for an after work/uni watch in the evening!Well scripted and good actors, would happily watch it again now if I could !"
" Unconvincing rom-com for the Tinder generation
",2019-01-25 00:00:00,3,"A rom-com for the Tinder generation that somehow feels overly long despite running at under 90 minutes. I thought being snowed in at a stranger's apartment following a one night stand might be a unique take on the genre. And sure, it had a few laughs, but it still somehow pulled out every cliche in the book.The two leads just didn't have convincing chemistry either, despite both being good actors in their own right. Their characters were kind of unlikeable and tonally, the film seemed all over the place - even for a ""turn your brain off"" film of this type. It did succeed in making me feel awkward and uncomfortable just watching though, putting myself in their situation.Ultimately, 'Two Night Stand' feels like the type of film your Tinder match would force you to watch on a sketchy ""Netflix and Chill"" date."
" Surprisingly smart dialog
",2019-01-24 00:00:00,7,"Good movie if life is being tough on you today, and you need a few smiles, belly laughs, and possibly a couple of tears."
" Light , , not stupid , , funny in just the right parts
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,8,"Although a completely predictable story line, these two offer us some pretty good information about ourselves while avoiding cliche."
" Not funny
",2019-01-07 00:00:00,3,"3 stars were given just for Miles Teller, his character is the only one I can stand this entire movie."
" Cringy, Corny, Cheesy
",2018-12-19 00:00:00,1,"This is the kind of movie that makes you wanna pour fluorosulfuric acid into your eyeballs... and not in a good way.This is the kind of movie that makes you wanna throw the lead actors head first into an industrial tree branch shredder... and not in a good way.This is the kind of movie that makes you wish you could go back in time and prevent the writers from ever being born... and not in a good way.If you're into cringy writing and acting that tries way to hard at making statements just to make a statement, then you'll love this movie."
" PARADOXICAL
",2018-09-05 00:00:00,5,First of all i would like to know ahead of grasp a review. How a single night turning to a long one realtionship besides bearing a little bit conversation composed for to deny her old girlfriend. trigerring the things trying to workout with her doesn't make sense here.what actually director showed in the characters couldn't created a imprint. whatever i felt saddened it was a average movie
" Not for me
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,4,"I might have liked this more if I were a millennial, or if I didn't find his grand gesture to be so ridiculous."
" Its Good & fresh &Enjoyable Just dont expect too much.
",2018-07-27 00:00:00,4,Best Scene:Trying 2nd time.!! Worst Scene: Reason why She gets Upsets at the end.Its not that much a Masterpiece to look up to. But well Its Really fresh & U wont feel bored. Their Chemistry is Good & Well there u go A okayish Movie.Its Good & fresh &Enjoyable Just dont expect too much.
" Two Charming Leads Lead ""Two Night Stand"" to Victory
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,6,"Two Night Stand (2014) 
Director: Max Nichols 
Watched: 7/25/18 
Rating: 6/10 Adorable Miles Teller and former model Analeigh Tipton trapped together by snowstorm following a one-night stand have a captivating chemistry, 
Passive-aggressive honesty and highly personal sex critiques aggravating- but educational + entertaining, 
Cliched and predictable/unlikely scenarios and unrealistic outcomes, 
But sometimes suspension of disbelief is a small price to pay for smart writing/well-developed characters/witty humor- 
Not to mention the relatable spot-on portrayal of the equally audacious and hilarious world of online dating!

" great
",2018-05-14 00:00:00,7,It's actually pretty funny and it's just one of those movies that makes u wanna fall in love!!
" Funny, truthful, entertaining
",2018-04-30 00:00:00,9,"Very situational, and not for a mature audience, but overall enlightening. And very entertaining. Much laughter."
" WHAT A TERRIBLE MOVIE
",2018-04-13 00:00:00,1,"I just created an account purely for the purpose of trashing this movie. I am so angry and feel like someone should reimburse me for the time that i even spent watching it. I didn't even have high standards going in..... I mean the title is ""Two Night Stand"", thats a terrible title, who thought that was a good idea. My expectations were so low and somehow this still managed to disappoint me. I only watched it because Miles Teller was decent in Wiplash but jesus christ I cant believe the stupidity of this male lead. What a crazy a** perverted ignorant character. My pet mouse could write a better plot. The movie would have been better if his girlfriend turned out to be dead honestly...still wouldn't have been good but at least then you could have a sliver of sympathy or like feel something other than brain cells dying. I hated this movie."
" Psycho ending
",2018-04-11 00:00:00,1,"The film was good, enjoyable enough right up to the psycho stalker ending that ruined all the fun of it. 
He showed his true colours at the end and then stalked her and got her arrested to refind her after she obviously didn't want to be found again because she found out he was cheating on his girlfriend. Stuff of nightmares. And that she went back to him is how mainstream movies are normalising microagression from men to make it seem normal or caring when they are crossing dangerous boundaries and destroying people's self worth. Nope. Nope nope nope. Nope nopey nope nope."
" A very heartwarming romantic movie that i really enjoyed watching!
",2018-03-31 00:00:00,9,"The relationship between the two main characters felt very genuine and real. It was a funny, romantic and heartwarming movie. Analeigh and Miles have great chemistry together and it was really fun to watch. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes romantic comedies because this is definitely one of the good ones!"
" Dealing with boredom, tediously staged
",2018-03-30 00:00:00,2,"Megan has got to be one of the most self absorbed, immature and boring characters ever put on film. Why is Alec, a drag himself, even dealing with this behavior? Yes, of course, they are snowed in.. and sex. What else is there besides those two boring characters, performed by two dull actors? Not much.."
" A novel approach...
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,7,"How would you cope if you were trapped with your fleeting hookup, and found yourself deconstructing the encounter? Such is the engagingly modern premise of this movie. It works better than similar previous efforts such as ""No Strings Attached"" or ""Friends with Benefits"" because, a) it's funny, and b) the two characters don't know each other, so it doesn't feel contrived, and gives these people a decent excuse to be brutally honest with one another...This framework suits Teller in particular - he was terrific in ""Whiplash"", but outside of drama he unfortunately projects a conceited kind of air that makes him a difficult presence to warm to. That's not a problem here, as his character in particular is given moments and lines that paint him in an unsympathetic light.The film loses its way somewhat in the final 20 minutes, with the script searching for an unusual and plausible way of bringing the story to a conclusion (it succeeds at the former, but not so much with the latter!) For its first hour, though, this is a frank and funny look at how the different genders approach relationships."
" c,mon it was not that bad guys
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,6,"i read some pretty bad reviews from others.OK the movie had no originality.but you knew that ,when you read in the review ""two strangers stuck in a place"".the actors i thought were playing simple but OK,and young people,or actors ,can sometimes escape bad criticism because hey it is just a little movie,a little romance,and if you think the actors are cute and kind of likable it passes the time.that's what i think about the movie.and i wanted to watch it till the end although yes i knew what was going to happen.my belief is that there is a category of movies that you simply should not judge too harsh.actually the whole thing depends not entirely on the script but in the chemistry of the actors.and i thought these guys were pretty much OK hanging around together.having said that,it was not a great love story or anything as such.but i do not think they intended it to be.i give it a six and a half rating."
