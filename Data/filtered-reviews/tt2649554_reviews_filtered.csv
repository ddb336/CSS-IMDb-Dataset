" Oooooh Aaaaah... What's the Point?
",2021-03-30 00:00:00,3,"Let me save you from watching this movie.There's a boy that for some reason was born into our world yet belongs in a world ""on top of"" ours. His eyes light up and he can intercept secret government radio transmissions and hack into cars and stuff. Can make meteors fall from the sky and crash a satellite.He also can focus his eye lights on people and make them feel ""comfort"". So a bunch of people on a ranch that looks like some church from, idk, the 70's?, form a cult around him or something. They have sermons at midnight because sunlight makes the boy go crazy.By now you're getting the picture... The movie is mostly about his family and a few family friends helping him get to some special coordinates. They travel in cars and hide in hotel rooms, for whatever reason taping cardboard to the windows etc. Also, the government wants to question the boy etc., and the evil sith from the newer Star Wars movies that absolutely suck is one of them, from the NSA. The boy elicits his help to escape their custody and continue on his journey.Finally they make it there, and the boy lights up again and everyone in the vicinity sees this magical world which is really just a bunch of very tall, spiral-y and bendy structures, and some wisp-like humanoids walking around. Whoopdy doo. The boy finally made it. The end.What's the heckin point of this movie? It's just a random story full of random details and lots of emotional trauma for his family and the cult and stuff. It's as if someone heard a couple stories about Bible prophets or something, and then had a wild nonsensical dream and wrote it into a movie script.There I saved you 2 hours. You're welcome."
" ""Sometimes we are asked to do things that are beyond us.""
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,7,"I liked this film for it's originality, even though comparisons can be made to other sc-fi flicks, take your pick. The scene with Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) interviewing Alton (Jaeden Martell) in the secure facility was cleverly done, with the young boy shown sitting and standing, both at the same time. His mysterious powers take on a new dimension when he suddenly reveals to his father (Michael Shannon) that he 'belongs in another world'. Yet with all the revelations made along the way, there do appear to be inconsistencies in the story line. Alton's uncontrollable 'eye blasts' make for a cool special effect, but it's never made clear what their purpose is, and when he admits that he rained the rocks out of the sky to destroy the gas station, you might get the idea that his power is not meant to be benevolent. There's also the conundrum of how Sevier managed to sneak the boy out of a lock down facility with dozens of military and intelligence authorities on hand to prevent an escape if one were even attempted. OK, so there was a power outage, but what about redundancies to prevent an escape. The imagery of the alien construct that appeared in the middle of the swamp was cool in and of itself, but did it simply spring up, or was it already there and decide to reveal itself? Inquiring minds would like to know these things, so in that respect, the story didn't provide the kind of closure I was looking for. particularly with Roy, under arrest and in prison, just standing there at the end of the picture with his eyes to the sky. Yeah, Alton's up there I guess, but with no correlation to much of what went before regarding 'The Ranch', the boy's mission, or the significance of the March 6th date."
" Close Encounters of the Confusing Kind
",2021-02-26 00:00:00,5,"Midnight Special is a chase film masquerading as some sort of sci-fi movie. It's far better at being the former than the later. In fact, the whole 'they come from outer space' plot hurts the film immensely.
There are the usual stock characters for a B level sci-fi effort; the mom, the one government official who 'gets it', the manipulative religious fanatic, the shouting general ...they're all here and none of them matter. What really works in this film are the tight moments on the run. The pacing is just right and even the unexplainable detours can be overlooked because the whole 'on the run' segments are so well done.
The ending is right out of one of the comic books that appear throught the film and it almost kills the move."
" boring and makes no sense
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,4,This movie was written very poorly and there were thousands of plot holes and unanswered questions. Good concept but failed flat and even the A list actors couldn't save it.
" Twaddle
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,4,"Jeff Nichols is pretentious and this is a preposterous waste of acting talent. The best lines come from Driver and the relationships make zero sense. There is no reason to empathize or care for any of these characters and unlike some movies where that is the point, this one just misses time and time again. I gave it a four because of Joel Edgerton and Kirsten Dunst. Shannon should have stayed married to that girl in Punxsutawney or the groundhog.. Asinine and meaningless twaddle"
" Starman/ET/Close Encounters
",2021-02-15 00:00:00,6,"Starman, E.T., CEOTTK, and a few other sci-fi movies, all done much better than this movie here. Oh quick, let's get our son to the mysterious destination, so 'Scotty can beam him up!' Too slow in too many parts, too many questions unanswered, and character backgrounds nonexistent. Maybe the title should've been ""Daytime Normal"". Better to tune in and watch the movie ""Knowing"" with Nicolas Cage. Not the greatest sci-fi movie, but a little better than this one."
" Where is a film editor when you need one?
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,1,"Julie Monroe, the editor of this tedium, must have slept through this one like the rest of us. She could have cut out half of the insipid gazes, poignant pauses, and interminable slow-mo effects and had a 75 minute movie with a possibly discernible plot."
" ET, Abyss, and Close Encounters without the emotion
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,5,"The best part was seeing Kirsten Dunst 20 years after Bring it On, my ""desert island"" movie. Aside from that, this was recycled from the above movies, and it was highly illogical. Like, why did Lucas quit his job for this event? Why did the kid's father give him up in the first place? And the mother? There was little if any motive for anyone to do anything they did. I was on the verge of turning it off but it was too late to start another movie. A few actors, particularly Adam Driver, made an impression, but a coherent and meaningful script would help."
" Yes,I saw this as a waste of time.
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,2,"What a disappointing movie. Too much of a mash up relying on big actors and hope of the viewer overlooking gaps in storytelling. It was like a book with many pages torn our. To much left out or lacking connection or follow through. Kind of leaves a feeling of nothing learned. This movie relies to much on clich√©s.Lots of undeveloped plot lines that are just dropped and people actions that make no sense. Just another run from the government with little explanation and logic. The film is shot nicely, pace is good although shallow and unrealistic and soundtrack is well done. Acting is good.The sci-fi aspect is mediocre but that is excusable because it is fantasy and simply a conjecture. Too much of this movie consists of absurd and unexplained situations and then simply dropped. Waste of two hours. Yes, waste of time."
" Interesting plot
",2021-01-22 00:00:00,5,"The idea of the different dimension or universe is very interesting, maybe it would have been better to focus more on that. What was annoying in the movie was the long pauses and staring at each other for no reason. The movie was fun overall, could have been better."
" Jeff Nichols Marathon
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,8,"Underseen homage to John Carpenter and Steven Spielberg. Much better than Stranger Things, which came out later. Visually, it's concise and confident film making, with an incredibly strong control of its craft."
" Better than expecting
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,8,"I did not expect much after reading the reviews. But I found it very well paced, great acted and generally a solid film., I also love how there is almost no exposition. That's how all movies should be.
8/10"
" Can it get more boring?
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,1,"The whole movie could have been cut to 20 minutes without any loss. Very basic story. Beware, you might fall asleep."
" Interesting plot idea
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,8,The great actors are squandered here because they mostly look serious (when they're not grabbing the kid and running away).
" A movie where you can spend a night.
",2020-12-25 00:00:00,6,"The escape story of the supernaturally powerful son and father, who are after a cult and the state.Directed and written by Jeff Nichols, whom we know from films such as Take Shelter (2011) and Mud (2012), the movie attracts attention with its solid cast members such as Michael Shannon, Joel Edgerton, Kirsten Dunst, Adam Driver and Jaeden Martell. Although it may succumb to stereotypes in some places, it is a movie where you can spend a night with its original theme and visual beauty. 6.5/10"
" How did they manage to drag this out so long?
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,1,"I thought something exciting was eventually going to happen. It didn't.
It started slow and got slower
Even the music dragged on.
.
The story could have been told in 30 minutes maximum"
" Not sure if I like it or not...
",2020-11-24 00:00:00,7,"The main problem for me is that the first part of the movie feels like the middle, and just takes a long ride to the end...no story build up, nor background; and other than some sort of exciting moments in between, the whole movie was rather low key...Sooo, I'm on the fence...sometimes I like low key movies, but I can't really say this one caught my attention...it's more like it stole my attention for a while...Overall, a good thought provoking movie, but I haven't yet figured out what I am supposed to discover...**Update**Alright, I finished it! Sorry, but I gotta say it...for a two hour movie it was sure missing a lot of story!!! I ended up being generous and gave it a 7 for trying to generate some real interest in the outcome...except for some 'nice' CGI at the very end this movie had little to show for the attempt at greatness..."
" That's how is done
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,7,"This is how you build characters, build story and build a world. Actually holds your attention while being for more. That's how it's done."
" Not amazing but worth the watch
",2020-11-21 00:00:00,6,"This is a tense but slow sci fi that is well-directed, well-acted, but poorly written. The acting is exceptional, from the young boy up to the government officials. The movie starts entertaining and somewhat mysterious, it builds to a decent partial-reveal in the 'second half', and then the entire final third of the movie is a plothole disappointment as things occur without explanation, rhyme or reason. The very last scene is ""interesting"", but leaves things totally up to the viewer to interpret. For me that interpretation was, ""What was that there all about?"" There was no explanation whatsoever for the final scene, leaving the audience to guess as to the why and what is to come.The plot is cliche: your typical government-after-the-unknown shtick. The directing however kept viewer interest from beginning to end. The limited special effects are decent enough, but completely unexplained (yes be forewarned, there are no pat answers in this flick). How did the boy get here? Why do his eyes glow? What is it with the sun? The only thing that made sense was everyday church members becoming murderous maniacs; we've seen that enough through history to be totally believable. The dialogue in the movie well-covers that issue.I give it 5 stars for being entertaining and one extra star for fine acting and pretty decent directing, despite the weak and untidy story line. Many viewers here would have enjoyed a stronger script and more well-defined plot rather than this unkempt and not-all-that story. This is basically parents and others protecting a young boy from those who would take advantage of him (or fear him). Everything else is sort of patched together in an unfulfilling manner.The reviews here are all over the scale, from ""hated it"" to ""it's okay"" to ""better than most"" to ""loved it"". That pretty much describes the way this movie works: nothing definite. A bunch of interesting ideas thrown together. This is one film where the acting actually did manage to pull it out of the dumpster. With lesser acting skill this might have been a 3-star loser.I don't rate it higher because it leaves string dangling and could have provided more in story line. I'll say it again: if you're going to make a movie, start with a very strong story to being with. Otherwise, don't bother. This is worth the watch, but could have been much MORE worth the watch with a stronger script and better resolution.We've seen better, and we've seen far worse. This is a cut above the average and decent enough entertainment."
" It's a thinker
",2020-11-21 00:00:00,8,"I'm not smart enough to know what it was really about, but I enjoyed how it got there."
" Not enough back story
",2020-11-06 00:00:00,6,"To me, this came off as pretentious, with little dialog or explanation attempting to create mystery and awe. They touch on the back story but leave so much open that you may feel kind of cheated. It could have been a better movie if they explored why and how things came to being."
" My interpretation
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,10,"This whole movie is about 2 things: 1) The Higher Dimension living above ours, and 2) Evolution1) The Higher Dimension: Alton was born in our dimension, but really belonged in the dimension above our own. This could also be called a parallel universe. It wasn't a mistake that Alton was born here. He was meant to be a connector between the two worlds and had to go through all the things he did to fulfill that purpose. The structure we see at the end of the film exists in the dimension above ours. It's always there, but hidden from view. We saw it for a brief moment when the energy was released. We have learned by studying Quantum Physics that nothing is solid. One of the things the higher dimension does is guide us on a daily basis. Some people believe in Angels. It is very possible that our angels and guides reside in this higher dimension. There are other purposes for this dimension as well, things that happen there, too, that we may never know. The beings who live there are light beings. And, one of the reasons that some of us here on this plain of existence, some of us that are filled with light, have a certain knowing, sometimes called intuition, is because we are unconsciously connected to higher dimensions just like this one. We may not always understand the guidance we receive, but we intuitively trust it. Our dimension is changing and evolving to help us become more light beings like the one above us. It is important not to resist the change we are experiencing. This is one reason practices like meditation are so important.2) Evolution: As our world changes, it may be difficult, even painful, but it is usually only painful when we resist. If we can learn to quiet our minds and remain more open, the guidance we receive from this higher dimension will help us to evolve. Sometimes certain individuals (like Gandhi, Buddha & Jesus) come along to act as connectors to these higher dimensions. I believe that Alton was one of these individuals. But, because he was needed elsewhere and was not meant to be a martyr here on earth, he was instructed as to how to find the location needed for him to ascend to the higher plain. Remember, the night his mother told his father to be prepared for the possibility that Alton may not be coming back. This was her intuition. She had that special knowing. Both of Alton's parents had the gift of higher understanding. That's one reason that Roy, Alton's father, knew that his son wasn't dying and that he needed to get him to a certain location by a certain time. Alton becomes reborn by the sun (the light that gives life to everything on our planet) and helps him evolve into a light being.Additional notes: As there is less of a division between science and spirituality we are coming to learn that what we touch and see is not solid. It creates more questions for us to answer. A lot of people who are asking the questions are guided by this higher dimension. Not everyone hears or believes what science is telling us. It is always an individual choice.At the end of the film, Alton's mother cuts her braids. This act is her severing her ties to the farm and other worldly (earthly) ties that bind to close ones mind to the truth. She is now free to spend the rest of her life being guided by the higher dimension in the knowing that mankind is evolving, and that everything that happens has a purpose. She now understands and has seen humanity's first glimpse into how expansive the Universe actually is.The true meaning of Faith is to trust the knowing within us and allow it to guide us to places that others (who need data proof) would not go. There is more to life than analysis. We have feelings for a reason. Alton and his parents (including Lucas) understood this; as did Sevier, on some level. As humanity continues to evolve, more and more of us will come to know this truth. The higher dimension insures it!"
" Good
",2020-10-29 00:00:00,7,Enjoyed this way more than I thought I would. Solid 7.5/10
" Do something better with 2 hours like learning common core math
",2020-10-24 00:00:00,1,Two hours of waiting for something to happen....and still waiting. I wish I could rewind time and not watch this.
" Is It Too Much To Ask For You To Punch Me In The Face???
",2020-10-22 00:00:00,6,So a kid with special powers is being smuggled / protected by his DAD and his Deputy buddy . The Government is after them.Much hilarity ensues. In the End the kid opens up another dimension and then he goes away with it.It's a pretty good story. Well shot. Good acting. Altho I really don't see how people lived thru it all.6/10
" Terrible flat ending
",2020-10-20 00:00:00,3,"The build up was good, until it felt like an abrupt ending with no logic and left out too many parts unexplained. You anticipate that the build up will have some kind of revelation as you get closer to the end. But the story just comes to an halt with a flat unimaginative ending."
" Lacklustre
",2020-10-18 00:00:00,4,I really couldn't get into this and found myself in the end not really caring enough. Trying to be Close Encounters or ET is not enough to carry this through and In fact it lacks both a sense of wonder and engagement and the scale that both those films had. Not helped by unconvincing characters Direction and script
" Briliant scifi indie in the Spielberg vein.
",2020-10-14 00:00:00,6,"Do you have good memories from 'encounter of the 3rd kind'? This is the 2016 indie film inspired from it essentially.It's extremely well acted, produced and the SFX hold water to big hollywood production.It's actually a film which I think will be quite pleasing to a younger audience the way 'encounters' did, in a good way.Very pleasantly surprised."
" Fantastic!
",2020-10-14 00:00:00,9,"I came across this title while scrolling through Netflix. Added it to my list to watch ""someday"". That day was today. I would have liked a little more back story on the parents and how they found the cult. Harden Martel, what a kid! Solid acting. Beautifully filmed. I wanted more!!! Love Adam Driver.
Solid 9 stars from me. Highly recommend."
" too many unanswered questions
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,5,"Thought it was a great movie until it ended without completing the story. What was the purpose of the boy being in this world? How did his two normal parents give birth to boy with odd powers from another world? What was the purpose of the boy's powers? What was this other world all about?If the writers expected us to complete their incomplete story, that fell flat with me. The acting was great, the suspense was constant, but the ending was a disappointment. I expected the movie to pull things together and make sense. It didn't."
" Good reason it's a box office flop
",2020-10-01 00:00:00,2,"Because it flops like a dying fish.Let's see: Boy with ""amazing powers"". Check. He wears blue blockers because... it's cool. Check. He knows things he shouldn't. Check. Apparently, people find it gratifying to be burned with his x-ray eyes, (?) Check.And lots of penetrating lights. That's always a SF winner.One of the reviewers said the second kind of bad movie sucks you in for half the movie before you cut your losses. That was me. I'll spend the rest of this movie's time watching my cat sleep, which will be much more rewarding."
" another talking drama
",2020-09-27 00:00:00,5,"This is a real snoozer, first off an over the top stereotypical cult, Nazi like FBI and an homicidal people trying to hide a special gifted kid has all the standard cliches and easy to guess plot scenarios. The more they whisper and the more they stress hushed tones is used far to much to build the drama. lame acting, no energy film that fails at building any real drama or suspense. Also, it's hard to understand what most of the people are talking about, as there is no dynamics in there voices unless there suddenly screaming incoherently. waste of time to watch and rate for me. But we are all entitled to our own opinions, and this is mine, and you are free to have yours."
" Midnight not so special
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,7,Don't get me wrong it was an interesting slow burn science fiction film. The characters were interesting and I enjoyed the dark gritty film Scenes. But it was slow and the story really wasn't that strong to where I might even give it a 6.5 but overall 7. The movie felt heavy or meaningful only to disappoint.
" Good actors and good acting wasted on an empty story
",2020-09-24 00:00:00,1,Good actors and good acting wasted on an empty story. 80 percent of the movie passes by waiting for any dialog coming out from characters. They are trying to create mystery out of nothing
" Can end this in 10 mins...
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,1,I wish this was just a Youtube 5 minutes clip rather than putting my 1.5 hour on repetitive plot...Basically you can summarize this movie in 2 lines. An alien kid got some mental parents and cults.
" Think of it as an above average SyFy special
",2020-09-16 00:00:00,6,"This movie hard to review without spoilers, but I'll do my best.
A boy and his ""father""? (That's not well explained) as well as a close friend are being led to a location that the boy fells drawn to. The US government is in hot pursuit because the boy is exhibiting strange abilities that he has yet to understand. Along the way the boy gains more understanding of what he is and where he must go to return to where he belongs.
The movie was made very well, and the cast and acting are excellent. The only downside are all the unanswered questions, most of which are backstory questions or details about the boy's powers and homeworld. However, this movie is worth a look if you're bored one night...that's why I watched it on Netflix. 6/10...entertaining, but vague, but they did what they could in a 1h:50m runtime"
" I agree, there is something missing
",2020-09-14 00:00:00,3,"I will have to check to see if this was a book converted in to a movie. Usually when that happens there are items dropped out of the production which make the movie shorter or doesn't jive with the directors vision.This movie was fairly good with the mystery factor. It was quirky enough, different enough, that it didn't fit the Hollowood typical movies and that was refreshing. However, the movie didn't live up to what ever it was building to and that was a big let down.There are some silly deus ex machina scenes which really shouldn't have been in the movie. I think the writers and director got lazy. They didn't know how to work the scene to move it forward and they just said ""screw it"".I get it. Multiverse/futuristic beings observing/blah blah, but it didn't work for me. There is no reason given for why this all took place and what the connection is between the boy, this reality and their reality. It really just is a cluster of ideas, poorly executed. The structure is missing too much.Overall, I was disappointed. Two thirds of the movie was good, the final one third just ruined it because there was no climax, no closure."
" Interesting movie.
",2020-09-14 00:00:00,7,"Most of the reviews I read after watching this movie hold far lower standards than the movie. If you don't like it. Fine. Is there any need or justification for rudeness and vulgarity. I think not. This review is in part, an indictment of all the selfish and opinionated reviews that are hateful rather than helpful. To the reviewer that complained that the meteor shower didn't make sense? That's because it wasn't a meteor shower but had you paid attention you would know that. Anybody who complains about the acting is not a good judge of acting. It was a strong cast and they did a great job. Period. Comparing it to close encounters is only valid from the point of view of an inhabitant of another world wishing to return home. Other than that it has no relationship with that Spielberg nonsense.I have only one minor criticism of this movie. It is slow paced. Other than that. It kept me engaged thru til the end."
" Waste of time

" It was slow and weird
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,1,"If I could give this zero stars I would! It had more questions than answers! It took Too long to actually understand what was going on. Too many slow family moments ,because the family is supposedly on the run! Story was rushed since they started the movie while they're running away from the government. They should have started the story as he was a little toddler and as he develops his powers. That way the audience can fully understand his powers more and build the suspense of the cult and the government. The scene of the meteorite shower had no affiliation with the story. Why? Well because the government didn't cause it so was it aliens? Or something super natural. It's like a puzzle piece that doesn't fit within the whole puzzle!!!!üò°Hollywood must just have money to burn!!!üíµüî•Had a great concept, but it was executed poorly!"
" Good movie but lacking
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,7,Good movie but very slow and not much happens for a long time making it a dull watch. Also I don't know if it is just supposed to be like this but most of the acting is wooden. Anyways unless you are a fan of sci-fi I wouldn't bother.
" Being Kept In The Dark/The Unknown Of A Movie Will Hold The Viewer Until It Ends
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,8,"09/12/2020 I've already watched over half of this film and still don't know what's going on with the father and son? Religion? Extraterrestrials? All of the four main characters played by Michael Shannon as Roy Tomlin. Joel Edgerton as Lucas. Kirsten Dunst as Sarah Tomlin and Jaeden Lieberher as Alton did an excellent job at drawing the viewer in to this strange movie, never knowing where it's going or how it might end? The ""need to know"" is the viewers hook. Watch for yourself and decide? Bon Appetit'"

" Awesome Film ~ Terrible Title
",2020-09-10 00:00:00,10,"I was flicking through Amazon Prime movies and came across Midnight Special. I wasn't expecting much to be honest, but wow what a gem of a film this turned out to be. My only criticism is the title, surely they could have come up with something catchier or more relevant than Midnight Special!"
" Good. But final third makes it fall short of being 'Very Good'.
",2020-06-11 00:00:00,7,"This movie has many strong facets:Good performances from all the actorsBeautifully shotDecent paceInteresting them/plotBrilliant soundtrackThe movie is set up well in the first 1/3. It keeps it hanging at 2/3. It convinces you that a profound message / reveal is imminent.But then the final 3/3 fails to achieve that in the way that 'Arrival' or 'Signs' did. I know those are great movies and it's unfair to make a comparison. But when such an emphasis is placed on a reveal, you better think of something good. And it's in this area that the writers are guilty of laziness and/or lack of imagination.Would give it a 6.5 if I could."
" Derivative science fi
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,4,"The story pulls scenes and plotlines from many other films and has a very weak ending.

" Could Have Been an Exceptional Movie
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,7,"This movie had potential excellent acting from an all star cast. I dont know if the misstep was in the writing, directing or editing? All other aspects were spot on. I feel this way because it felt a large part of the movie was missing. I feel as though I walked into the middle of the movie and was missing key information. Though I got to know and like or dislike the characters they didnt build the story enough or editing destroyed its introduction or it could be that the writer or director (spoiler alert) didnt want you to know more than what they wanted you to know and only that they were on the run from the beginning which is unfortunate. I wanted more and with the lack of a part 2, you can only guess. It feels like this was supposed to be part 2 of another movie but which, I'm not sure. Good but could have been better."
" Worth it specially for the ending
",2020-05-12 00:00:00,8,"I'm not saying the whole movie is not worth it because it is, but the ending specifically is what makes sci fi great and is what sci fi fans crave for. You won't be disappointed. I watched this movie without knowing anything about it whatsoever and it just works well that way. At first it may seem hard to make sense of things but it's OK that way. Just get into it and let it take you towards that awesome conclusion."
" Excellent Sci Fi
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,9,Loved this. Went in blind and thoroughly enjoyed it. Sure there are some plot holes & derivative chases but fit a budget Sci Fi film it is great. Best film I have watched this year.
" Incredibly slow, dull, and boring.
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,1,"Very little happens that is interesting, and it takes a very long time for very little to happen. I kept wondering ""when is something interesting going to happen"". Plodding and dull."
" Close Encounters Of The Worst Kind
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,1,"Lost another 2 hours of my life watching garbage. Not sure what this movie was all about and even less sure if there was some deeper message to be transferred to the audience. Guess the script writers were either very drunk or very dumb when they came up with this story, or better even, drunk and dumb. Picking up some ideas from various science fiction movies and somehow gluing them together doesn't make a good movie, it makes a terrible mess. It gets worse when the actors are also really, really bad and seem to have problems even remembering a single line with more than three words. The actual science behind a multiple worlds theory is awesome and would make a great movie when applied properly, but honestly if you can't come up with anything better than a bunch of dudes driving around aimlessly in some dumb car with some silly kid, then please find yourself another profession."
" Why do people like to give s*itty movies gopd review's?
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,3,"Really doesn't make much sense why people rate movies so high and call them sleeper hits or great movies or say things like this is how Indie movie should be done, when is movie is utter and total trash. Just because Michael Shannon and other good actors are in it does not make it good. The story makes absolutely no sense and the ending will leave you scratching your head, or possibly banging against your wall. It is by far one of the worst Indie Sci-Fi movies I've ever seen, and should be streamed straight to the Syfy channel, because that's the type of quality that this film is writing, directing and acting wise."
" Bad. Pointless, and bad.
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,4,"This review needs no words because the title is self explanatory. Still curious, watch it for yourself. But you'll wish you hadn't."
" Plot: Get special kid to specific place before gov't gets him
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,5,"I thought this movie would be good, but I guess I'm just not into all sci-fi movies. This is like Close Encounters because the kid and his father must get to a specific point in order for something amazing to happen. This kid a special ability where his eyes glow and shoot laser beams, in a bad way. I fell asleep while watching this movie (the part where they're in the hotel) but then woke up and realized I needed to finish this movie. Other people say watch it, I say pick another indie movie."
" Just dreadful
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,2,"Excellent cast, but it lacked any substance or depth. The acting alone could not save it. No thrills or intrigue at all to behold in this predictable snooze fest."
" Boring..
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,2,The film is too bad than I think. Good for lose time only :(. I love Jaeden
" Excellent
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,10,"The acting is superb , the cast excellent , the characters ,the story , the beauty ! I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this. I would put it up with the classics in this genre any day . I recommend."
" When parallel or future worlds collide
",2020-03-04 00:00:00,8,"What a good SiFi should be Indie or Big budget, this is somewhere in between budget wise seems to me. I've been a fan of Michael Shannon for a while his low key earnest style is compelling and he really sells his part. The ending, though not completely unexpected, was quite cool, loved this movie."
" Watch this movie. amazing!! Underrated!!
",2020-03-04 00:00:00,10,"Are you kidding me a scifi with a great story, Extremely great acting, great ending, no down time at all keeps you engaged. Not a Jeff Nichols fan didnt know who he was, but I do now phenomenal directing!! In my top 5 scifi of all time. Wont give anything away will just say you owe it to yourself to watch this masterpiece!!"
" There's an issue with those who are...
",2020-02-28 00:00:00,8,"STUPIDSTITIOUS!!!! This film is almost a perfect example of a father protecting a son who is from another world. Protecting the boy from our government and protecting him from a group of nitwits. Why the bad reviews? Because those who adhere to certain beliefs are eager to dismiss the beliefs which have evolved in those belonging to the congregation who are trying to bring the boy back to fulfill some kind of stupid plan. The religious hate this because the congregation is deviating from scripture. Which makes their beliefs look even more foolish. This movie makes the scientist look inept, and the religious look stupid."
" A bizarre mishmash of ideas
",2020-02-21 00:00:00,4,"I always enjoy a good sci-fi or mystery-based film. But this one was just so bizarre.The whole beginning of the film is based around the idea that the viewer knows nothing about what's going on. But as the story progresses, we start to understand that the writers had no clue what they are trying to write as well.It starts kind of like an episode of X-Files (Season 1) - Conduit. The ending becomes evident very fast but then the movie starts trying to have an original story, ultimately failing even in a what predictable story they could've had.The story makes no sense, the ending has no reason to be the way it was shown, half of the run time is closeups of people's faces thinking about something good. The kid is a plot device, he's not interesting and ultimately nothing can make you care about him.The creators tried to catch you off guard by not just choosing one of the plausible endings but just mash together all the ideas this film could've resolved to.The ideas are not grounded enough to be believable, but at the same time they are so disconnected you can't make any sense of the film even if you try your best. Mix this up with an actually good cast - Driver, Shannon, Edgerton - and you still get a good 30 mins of blank stares and bad dialogue.At least it was fun to hear Shannon speak about Superman in the comic, I was waiting for him to scream KNEEEEEEEEEEL! to the kid, but sadly, he didn't."
" Lacking depth or attention to detail
",2020-02-15 00:00:00,4,"Waited for some intrigue, twist or real interest to develop. Sadly predictable plot which drags."
" Even better than mud
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,10,His best movie yet. Surreal and magical yet grounded.
" Only disappointing aspect is not having the song Midnight Special by CCR in it
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,8,"One of the best indie films of the decade! Very well acted Sci-Fi about helping a unique kid that's not from earth in which gets increasingly more interesting as the film goes on! I absolutely love the cast especially Micheal Shannon and Joel Edgerton, they're awesome in a lot of movies. This is a truly special experience with some deepness that is very gratifying, would highly recommend to anyone and I think it deserves better ratings."
" Not Special
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,5,I had high hopes for this one but for some reason that did not work out. I think they need more character development early on. They put you right in the middle of the story.
" Different than Other Indie Films
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,7,"This movie was unlike any other movie I had watched before. I'm not usually into drama, mystery movies, and at times I was a bit frightening (I get scared by movies easily). That being said I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this film.Usually I dislike when the characters know more than the audience, leaving them to figure out what is happening based on context clues. This is because it is often executed poorly, pulling the audience out of story; however, I believe the director found the perfect balance between suspense and knowledge.The acting was amazing. I was especially impressed by the young Jaeden Martell (Alton). His character easily could have been played as a blank slate, but Jaeden portrays him in such a way that sometimes you can't decide if he is a child or adult. He seems to constantly have this mature awareness about him, leading the viewers to believe that his knowledge goes beyond any adults comprehension, but in other moments he is a helpless child who needs his parents.I was along intrigued by Adam Drivers character Paul Sevier. He seems like a very complex man who doesn't really have any allegiance to either side. You can constantly see his wheels turning as he try's to analyze every new piece of information. It's a shame we didn't get to see more of this character.There were a few things throughout the film that left me with some unanswered questions. One of the main ones being the gunshot wound that Lucas (Joel Edgerton) receives. We see him get shot and instantly falling to the ground gasping for air as if he is dying. It appeared that he was shot somewhere in the upper chest; however, a few minutes later we see him get up and continue on as if he hadn't been shot.I also felt that some of the shots needed more lighting. I watched this movie on an iPad and often during the dark night scene I wasn't able to make anything out, even with my brightness all the way up.Overall this film reminded me a bit of Tomorrowland. I enjoyed watching it and was entertained the entire time, but if your looking for a more relaxing movie then I would try your luck at something else."
" Production, actors and some ideas are good, but the final spark is missing
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,6,"I really enjoyed most of the movie thanks to the mystery factor, the actors who all play well - may it be the main or the supporting roles or the almost flawless production.But there's so much build-up for something minor. Potential is definitely there, but disappointing in total."
" Middling sci fi
",2019-12-18 00:00:00,4,"'Midnight Special' builds, intrigue, interest and suspense nicely as it begins with a strong opening act.From then on in it morphs into a transparent hybrid of Spielberg and 1990's TV series 'The X-Files'.Whilst managing to lose its intrigue and interest at around the half way point.In the full summation of the films merit I feel that I've seen better realised films which dapple with these subjects and themes, many, many of those films coming from the late 80's through the 90's and correlating with the influencial work of Spielberg's career on the big screen and the X-Files on the small.The acting is passable and the direction largely unflustered but also un-enterprising. Sound design and special effects limited and the score unmemorable but also mainly unobtrusive.Sadly I had hoped for more. I didn't dislike the film and I feel that it's opening act has plenty of 'go' in it whilst providing enough hooks to get the audience involved in wanting to see what's next. The problems start with the ""what's next"" and continue to the finale.I rate a 4/10 from my own experience of watching the film twice; regrettably it wasn't a 'grower': failing to convince me any more on the second viewing than in the first."
" A great spiritual movie, turned sci-fi, turned spiritual again
",2019-11-09 00:00:00,10,"One of my most favorite sci-fi movies of all time. Most people didn't get it though, so here's some analysis. Contains spoilers:1. Where did Alton come from?Alton was conceived & born normally by his parents, as any human has. The fact that he could reach to other dimensions was a product of evolution. His father exhibits the same abilities (as shown at the very end when his eyes shine), but to a much smaller degree. The evolution of human kind to another state of being is teased.2. Where did the alien structures come from?They were not ""alien"" in the traditional meaning. They were on a parallel Earth (or another dimension), an Earth that had a different evolutionary path than ours. Parallel dimensions are hidden from our awareness under normal circumstances, but the biological evolutionary step mentioned above made it possible for Alton.3. What were these beings?These were light beings. That's where the spiritual part comes in: ""light beings"" are considered in spiritual circles to be very advanced entities. It's been teased by the movie that that's where humanity's future lies too. Also telling is that Alton is reborn by the sun (the light that gives life to everything in our planet).4. What was the point of the movie?Alton is a messianic figure, just not in the traditional terms. The cult thought that he was literally a religious figure, while Alton is messianic in a more subtle way: he reluctantly gives a preview to humanity of what lies ahead for them. The movie is about humanity's ""first glimpse"" of how expansive the Cosmos is. Not just in terms of aliens travelling from planet A to planet B (in the same universe) as all traditional sci-fi movies have been for so long, but also in parallel, and also up and down and inner and outer (in other words, the Cosmos is a web in all directions of different universes and dimensional existences). That's next-level sci-fi. That's the border between sci-fi and New Age spirituality (without the negative baggage that usually accompanies it in the minds of most people).5. Ugh, so New Age hogwash was the point of the movie?No. What people today call ""spirituality"" is really science that hasn't been understood yet. And since science can't explain it yet, some ""faith"" might be required in the meantime for those who had direct experience with it. This is why it was so important for Lucas to say ""I believe"", because after he had his direct experiences with Alton, he made the leap to faith. But belief is to be transcended by hard data, otherwise it becomes dogma, which keeps humanity down. This is what the movie is going for too: the leap from unbelief, to belief, to hard data, and not to dogma (that the organized religion/cult had fallen victim of).The most telling scene on this interpretation, is at the very end, when Durst is cutting her hair. You can interpret that scene as simply trying to get away from FBI, so she needs to change her appearance. Another, deeper explanation would be though, that Durst's character now is free from religion and dogma. You see, her braids were the same as the women in the cult. Even if she had left the cult, she was still bound by their beliefs for years after. By cutting down the braids, she's now free from such beliefs and dogma, she understands that the cosmos is more expansive, and that said expansiveness is not necessarily ""religious"" in nature, but rather, ""just is"".This was for me the best movie of 2016. The most forward-looking, and the most ""edgy"" sci-fi movie of them all, by literally moving the needle of sci-fi from caricature super-heroes, monsters, and A-to-B aliens, to a more expansive terrain that's more rich in potential. As an filmmaker myself, that's the kind of sci-fi I always wanted to make too.6. So why didn't so many people get it?It's because most people aren't indoctrinated in such cosmological ideas. Even if Alton did explain it at some point, about a ""world on top of ours"", that still didn't register with most people. Most viewers needed a way more spoon-fed explanation to get it (and maybe they should have received it, that's a failure of the movie production companies involved to not insist that the director gives it to them).Additionally, the press' comparison of this movie to the '80s Spielberg movies didn't help at all, because this movie had absolutely nothing to do with these older movies (people went to the cinema expecting something specific and recognizable, and they got something completely different instead). So they found the movie a boring dud, as if without significance, and with a WTF ending. But there is significance in the movie, it tells of a larger world that we will eventually reach one way or another, but that we must have faith until that day comes, when that faith transforms from belief to hard scientific data.This is not different than if the year was 1870, Jules Verne trying to convince people that one day we will have technology to reach for the stars, or the deeps of the sea, and instead, he gets people thinking he was crazy, or just a ""fantasy story without significance"". All it needed was some faith in the natural process of technological and/or biological evolution. That's what the filmmaker is asking of you today too."
" Slowly and quite boring.
",2019-10-05 00:00:00,6,Veeeery slowly movie! Acting was good. But I expected much more from this movie. Even the ending was nothing special.
" Quite Good
",2019-09-15 00:00:00,7,"This is a very well cast film. I am so glad to see Michael Shannon cast as a protagonist. He almost invariably is cast as an antagonist. Consequently, he really gets to show his acting chops; (for me) more than anyone else in this film. Unfortunately, I believe the ending would have been much better if it had been done in an ""unknowable"" way. However, the director took a shot at making it kniwable, which is impossible. That is why Stanley Kubrick was so much better than anyone else: He knew the future is unknowable, therefore. He never had the arrogance to show anything that did this. The closest he ever camr to doing so was in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968). Even then, it wasnt hom trying to show anyone anything about the future. He simply showed you cannot possibly know this. Arthur C. Clarke, who wrote 2001 and assisted Kubrick 4 years in the making of it. Anyway, I like this film, on spite of it's flaws. Worth a watch."
" Adam Driver is always an 11/10

" X-Men Third Rate (a pun, not a spoiler)
",2019-08-25 00:00:00,1,"On this long-winded road trip, someone forgot to pack a story.Yes, there's a plot, things do happen, but really they amount to sound and (muted) fury, signifying nothing.Something like Tomorrowland (2015) is far more emotionally engaging -- give that a go instead of this pointless pile of piffle."
" Unusual science fiction.
",2019-08-12 00:00:00,7,"Very interesting and well made. Very humane and really grips you. Well acted and not typical science fiction.... I recommend it
highly."
" Something different
",2019-08-10 00:00:00,10,"Different, smart, well written film with superb acting. This kept me engaged and interested throughout and was different to all other movies I've seen recently. Deserves a much higher rating than what it has on here."
" A decent sci-fi that keeps you thinking.
",2019-07-27 00:00:00,7,Midnight special is a stripped down sci-fi movie that keeps you thinking of what will happen in the end. It's well acted and the storyline is pretty engaging. Worth a visit.
" Waste of 2 hours.
",2019-07-26 00:00:00,2,"I have no clue why this movie has so much good reviews as it does. Just read that bad reviews and they're on point. In 2 hours this film managed to bore you, confuse you, and make you rethink your life choices.Acting:
Acting was decent, but there is literally only like 5 characters in this whole film and they managed to have no characterization to them and are absolutely boring and lifeless.Cinematography/special affects:
Camera shots were okay, no scenes really stood out with emotion or feeling. Special effects were Awful, lots of plotholes and fake looking sfx.Plot:
So terrible they manage to make a long 2 hour movie so confusing/boring and you dont get any explanation or reason behind the stupid sh** that happens. Probably because there are so many plot holes to count.
Conclusion:
Dont watch this movie, It is awful!! And I absolutely love sci fi/ fantasy movies. But this one has such a terrible story and plot, so many plot holes and stupid things that make me face palm. Like really? Light people?!?!"
" Another BS-movie

" If you want everything spelled out for you...
",2019-06-13 00:00:00,10,"...this is not the movie for you. If you like a little ambiguity and are okay with a movie that allows and even requires you to fill in the blanks, it's an amazing film. There are some slower parts to it, but they are earned and important. But if you're left at the end bothered by a bunch of questions, it's because this isn't the kind of movie that's made for you. (Also: if you have to name four or five films ""mashed together"" to label a film ""derivative,"" you're trying too hard. All modern stories are derivative if you can name enough things they are ""derived"" from.)"
" Great fantasy movie with an award winning cast
",2019-05-22 00:00:00,7,"Maybe im just partial to Joel Edgerton and certainly Micheal Shannon plays a big part in my rating and review but this was a different movie that made you ask alot of questions and mystery is the name of the game in this movie which i enjoyed watching very much. At the end when you get to see the alternate world was very much like dreams Ive had. It was really a wierd thing to see it on screen. But isnt that where writers get ideas sometimes? From dreams or their imagination? Movies don't always have to be black and white and this one is not and therefore it does make it special in my opinion. This was a very enjoyable film and the story line was definitely intriguing. It deserves a sequel to give more insight as to why and when this alternative world came about and why the boy was deemed so important to everyone. After all it was mentioned how important that the little boy was but not really as to why. There was a whole religious church revolved around him but all that happens is he crosses over and thats it. I want to see all the same actors do a sequel because it would not work without them and i believe the audience needs to know more. I We need to know before the journey the boys father and friend took him on and after his fabulous and screenworthy visual CGI disappearance. Midnight Special is Special, no doubt, but we need more!"

" Jeff Nichols uses his own son to create one of the great cult classics
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,10,"For those of you who know Jeff Nichols and his own magical ways, foreseeing his film Mud with the characters while he was in university, know Nichols truly believes magic exists out there and he has created in his own life and in now slowly building canon of exceptional films. Nichols is the John Lennon of movie making, often off beat, mesmeric in content, unconcerned with Hollywoord tripe twists and a an intense focus on the story he has to tell. While Nichols could before this be seen as an arty indie film maker, :""Midnight Special"" special with its incredible cast, special effects, length of film solidies Nichols in the gran theatre of movies. While this received a low key release and lack of cinema exposure sadly, hero movies and rubbish for the masses take away there, true aficionados of film making can glisten at the obsession to detail and even far from ""mindless"" ending, story, Nichols, which either way tells the story of a born accidentally born in the wrong dimension, Einstein's theory of mutiple dimensions is now well recognise or even he comes from the Jung;s unconscious collective which scribes has further furnished with a collective conscious, It is now scientific fact we are energy sources, chemo-electrical and the young buy has already devised his energy sources to operate at a level humans do not know until we enter the collective conscious. Nichols avoids any heavy rhetoric which is wise and focuses on a tiny part of the journey, ensuring ongoing suspense and intrigue.It is not without its faults and Nichols could have let a little more on where the boy originates from, his script also lets him down at times, the tension between Shannon and his friend the state trooper about the wellness of the boy is over emphasised to create a middle sequence, the state trooper excellent played by Joel Edgerton who seems able to play any role (starred as the antagonist in The Great Gatsby), it is a solid and understated performance by Kirsten Dunst as the boys mother. Michael Shannon however, dominates the screen and he has formed a formiddable coupling since several other movies and recently ""Mud"" with Nichols. The average american will put stilly and lack of knowledge of the portents of the film, and do not be put off by the shamelessly 6.6 rating while duds like Dunkirk get 8 just biggest its a blockbuster Americans rate it on its hype factor not content, Lastly, Adam Driver who is becoming a very special actor in Hollywood excellent plats the NSA agent searching for the young boy. Sam Sheperd makes a cameo at the beginning and Nichols adds another special title, much like he is the new Spielberg ignored by the mainstream but slowly crafting a canon of movies that will soon even eclipse the Nolan brother's, who disastrous Dunkirk has sunked their reputations excuse the pun. Wonderful movie,"
" Suitably enigmatic yet somewhat forgettable.
",2018-12-01 00:00:00,6,"A lot of 'Midnight Special (2016)' is suitably enigmatic, a mysterious and unique father-son story that spans quite a wide-range of genres, but it is ultimately fairly forgettable and isn't actually all that impactful, either. Where the strange sci-fi premise sort of falters is in its almost 'explain all' ending, since it makes you wait a long while for it and then over does pretty much every aspect, but even this is kind of ambiguous and unexpected, so it isn't a major detriment to the overall piece. 6/10"
" The Gruff Gentleman Genre
",2018-10-29 00:00:00,6,"Who better to define the Gruff Gentleman than Michael Shannon, working again with Jeff Nichols.The film beams its child messiah from science fiction rather than religion. And solar power sure looks promising in the eyes of our young lad.Another way to look at this would be from the less popular side of an amber alert. Or even less plausibly as a Waco makeover. Nice to see Sam (RIP) Shepard protect his flock here.I watched it as part of a Shannon appreciation project, and with an odd ear for Don Kirshner references."
" Same old
",2018-09-08 00:00:00,4,"MIDNIGHT SPECIAL is another same-old family science fiction thriller with a story that seems to rip-off E.T. at every opportunity. Once again we have a film with a kid with special powers who finds himself on the run from the corrupt authorities and pursued by nameless government agents who want to bring him back for testing. As usual he's accompanied by a few good men who risk everything, including their own lives, to save him. What this film does have going for it are a couple of good actors in the form of Michael Shannon and Joel Edgerton; both deliver likeable and sympathetic turns, although Kristen Dunst feels shoehorned into the story and Adam Driver seems to be trying to be Jeff Goldblum throughout. The film is also well shot and the action and chase scenes are handled well; a shame, then, that it has such a passive, seen it all before so that it's impossible to get excited or involved in any of it."
" Comes close to the similar magical suspense of ""The Close Encounters of the Third Kind"".
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,8,"Where ""Midnight Special"" truly excells at is the credibility of science fiction being placed in the real world of today. It is simultaneously as real AND magical as ""The Close Encounters of the Third Kind¬® was. Real and magical are two complete opposites, but that is the real strength of this movie: it makes me believe in the impossible. And that's quite an achievement, me being a rational person.The only small criticism I have of ""Midnight Special"" is that at the end of this story some magical outer worldly powers become visible. It is always more suspenseful for me, to fear or fantasize about what is in the dark and cant be seen. Once the monster or whatever is revealed, however scary or freaky it might be, the thrill is somewhat gone for me. Just a mysterious open end without any special effects, would have fitted better and would have upped my rating to a 9. Director Jeff Nichols really has got the talent to portray forces, feelings and spiritual entities, without losing credibility. That is somehing few directors are able to achieve. It is the best mix of realism and science fiction I have seen in a long time.Photography, soundtrack and especially acting are truly terrific. Really great performances by Michael Shannon and the little kid. I never like kids in movies much, because often they just cant act very well. This one can though. Really exceptional! This is one heck of a slowburning, mysterious supspense thriller. Not suited for those who just long for a fun filled action thriller.Highly recommended for the arthouse audiences. ""Midnight Special"" is a surreal, magical experience which mesmirized me in a way no other movie has done lately. Really impressive! Chilled me to the bone..."
" Strangeness and beauty

" AMAZING...
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,10,"To anyone giving this movie anything less than a 7/10... you are uncultured in film and have not the eye of a true indie film lover. You are the same person that quotes legally blonde and spends half their time scrolling through Instagram during a movie.This movie, including the director, is unique in many ways including his choice of actors, scripts, score, and cinematography. It introduced new ideas, not recycled plots/theories from other films, and did it in such a magical way that can't be compared to any other film. And the end of the film reveals an amazing hidden truth about the universe that has all captured our imagination at least once in our life before, and that this movie does a fabulous job of making it real."
" Boring
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,2,"I barely write any reviews, but since this movie seems to have a very good score, I've decided I'm going to write a review as to why I'm giving it such a low score.The main issue with this movie is that is very slow, we are 30 minutes in and nothing has really happened. Two guys driving with this special kid around. Apart from two somewhat interesting scenes with the cop shooting and then when a guy was looking into the boy's eyes and some beam coming from them, there was nothing else.Even after the first 30 minutes, it's just very slow unfolding, the characters do a lot of needless and boring talk, the scenes are all drawn out, etc... So yeah, it was very slow and boring.Another issue I had is the darkness of the video, it was just too dark all around, there was barely any light, the whole movie seemed like it was dimmed and darkened to ""set the mood"", but all it did was make it less enjoyable to watch.I like the premise of the movie, the actors are decent as well, but the first 30 minutes of the movie could have been done in like 10 minutes. The first hour in like 20-25 minutes. The whole movie could have realistically be done in 40 minutes. That is probably why they stretched it out so much, why everything was so slow.Ultimately I ended up being way too bored trying to watch this movie."
" How a great indie scifi should be done.
",2018-06-07 00:00:00,9,"Up there with films like The Signal this was a indie scifi fans dream.Far too many big budget scifi rubbish on our screens over the years , not going to name anything in particular but its the same old same old tag line and Im sure anyone reading this will now exactly what Im talking about ."
" Moments of style, but overall far LESS than the sum of its parts!
",2018-05-09 00:00:00,6,"Jeff Nichols's ""Midnight Special"" takes considerable liberties with its viewers, demanding that they go through at least the first 25 minutes of movie without really knowing what on Earth (or beyond it?) is going on. A film had better be good if it's going to do that to it's audience, and - after that build-up, plus many a good minute more, it fails to actually do that, first and foremost reaching its climax (which is actually quite pleasing and innovative aesthetically) with many a filmgoer compelled to ask: SO WHAT?For at least half of this movie we are left convinced that something pretty dire is going to happen to a large proportion of us - indeed the term ""judgment day"" is resorted to at some earlyish point in the film, but this concept is later abandoned altogether. The location/ground zero of the upcoming event is pondered at length - ""why there?"", they all ask. Answer - no reason at all, it's just a bit of swamp... Equally, a huge (if mawkish) dose of tension that our young hero-cum-prophet Alton (well enough played, if with VERY few words, by Jaeden Lieberher) is steadily succumbing to ... whatever it is and may not make his appointment with destiny, is likewise dumped unceremoniously, but without any particular sense of relief. Things should not be like that.Equally (2), the religious cult that has built up around Alton (and built up its supply of weapons likewise) threatens much and then fizzles completely - so just what is that all about? (And just where did what initially seems like a key character played by Sam Shepard disappear to??????) Adam Driver's somewhat Golblum-esque role in seeking to work out what is happening is fun enough, but looks a little out of place amongst all the portentous stuff, while Alton's growing ability to control technology and deploy his manifold powers is used in such an ad hoc manner that games are played with our patience without true focus ever being achieved. Kirsten Dunst is probably the best-known face in here, but does very little beyond the most basic ""proud mum"" stuff. ""Midnight Special"" is NOT a dead loss, and is particularly interesting in its brief ""first contact"" section, but even that dramatic circumstance does not offer us the focused ""everything has now changed/nothing will ever be the same again"" scenario that might have been expected. All is just dissipated and we are almost none the wiser.So why on Earth not? Why do we have yet another piece of sci fi lashing out rather randomly in all directions and achieving so relatively little? If this movie was never really meant to be scary, then why does it waste our time hinting at being so? Equally, if it is trying to out-Arrival ""Arrival"" with some kind of beautiful wow (and let's face it, this is not the most challenging task in cinema history), then why does it waste the artistry it is able to pull together with so little in the way of take-home message?Oh dear, oh dear...Made 41 years ago now, ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" is so VERY much better than this effort, or indeed than ""Arrival"". Just why is that so?"
" Boring as sh**t
",2018-05-07 00:00:00,3,"I fell asleep 3 times, on three different occasions, trying to finish this movie. Boring, acting is dull, story is dull, everyone has the same facial expression through the entire movie. Even the action sequences put me to sleep. I really couldn't stand this movie. Awful. Terrible. Don't watch it."
" Intelligent and misunderstood
",2018-04-01 00:00:00,9,"I've seen a lot of negative reviews for this movie calling it joyless and saying that it's confusing. To some extent, both these things are true. This is because the world of the film and the way it is written are both very grounded in reality. As moviegoers, we are so used to characters explaining their motivations to us, and in science fiction movies we expect a genius type character to eventually show up to tell the audience what is going on as it happens. One has to wonder, do all these characters constantly explain themselves to one another? What did they talk about before all of these crazy adventures begin? Jeff Nichol's Midnight Special is not that kind of movie. Watching characters interact is like looking in on the dialogues of real people going through unbelievable circumstances. The writing allows the viewer to interpret what is going on, instead of explaining it to them immediately. This can be confusing for some, but the film is quite clear if you're paying attention. This realistic and mysterious writing fits perfectly in a story that is all about having faith in the unknown and believing in the impossible. I implore anyone who has watched and dismissed this film to give it another chance and watch it under this mindset. It is a truly unique and magnificent film if given the chance."
" Total Dud. A Numb Cliche.
",2018-03-30 00:00:00,4,"This was painful to watch. From the bizarre feeling that the actors were on sedatives (they spent most of the film staring at each other and taking 5 times longer to reply to one another than anyone has ever taken) to the uninteresting main character to the weak special effects this is a huge miss.
And the big reveal at the end? Bland, unimaginative, and clich√©."
" Dull, slow, boring
",2018-03-12 00:00:00,3,I sat through all of this hoping it would develop into something more exciting!
" Started right...but didn't quite get there
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,6,"Nichols is a gifted filmmaker. Both ""Take Shelter"" and ""Mud"" were special movies, stories that allowed complex characters to be sucked into intense drama within real settings. And the first 2/3 of this movie felt like it was heading the same way, from the fundamentalist kickoff to the surreal twists. Unfortunately, it just did not stick the landing. Too many unanswered questions and too many cliche sci fi moments. I wanted more than just an homage to 80s Spielberg flicks, but the emotional payoff was lacking here."
" Would it be to much to ask to have you punch me in the face?
",2017-12-17 00:00:00,8,"May contain some plot/theme spoilers.Alton (Jaeden Lieberher) Alf would be too obvious, likes to listen to the radio...in his head. He repeats what he hears thus ""speaking in tongues"" which appeals to ""The Ranch"" a Texas cult built upon Alton's spewing including classified information which draws due diligent attention. Roy (Michael Shannon), a member of the group, absconds with his own child (adopted by the pastor) with the aide of a friend Lucas (Joel Edgerton) a policeman who is not a religious person. Mom (Kirsten Dunst) left the compound 2 years ago.Seems Alton has places to go, like Frank Lloyd Wright heaven, which appears near Pascagoula Mississippi?Now how this seemingly alien baby had human parents and had to live in the dark as an infant wasn't discussed in the film. This is a film which attempts to combine religion, spirituality and UFO sightings into one ""real"" explanation, although I liked ""Altergeist"" string theory better.The story was interesting even if the characters tilted to the stiff side and the dialogue mostly reeked as in the case of most serious sci-fi films where the script writer was too engrossed in the me-so-clever plot as to take a minute to create memorable characters.Guide: Could be viewed as going against the grain of religion. Minor PG swearing. No sex or nudity."
" Terrible
",2017-10-08 00:00:00,4,"At 111 minutes, this ""Midnight Special"" turns into an endless experience, watching something that you have seen many times before with variations and different casts, including Martin Stephens in ""Village of the Damned"", Jeff Bridges in ""Starman"", Haley Joel Osment in ""A.I. ‚Äì Artificial Intelligence"", and a rubber puppet designed by Carlo Rambaldi. My admiration for Jeff Nichols' films grew every time he released a new title, from ""Shotgun Stories"" in 2007, to ""Take Shelter"" in 2011 and ""Mud"" in 2012. However, this time he has gone the way of the big scale special effects frenzy with unfortunate results: it is so silly and simplistic, so lacking in finesse and humor, that I could not believe that it was the work of the same director. Nichols had previously been so delicate and perceptive of human condition (including ""Take Shelter"", a movie about ESP), and dealt intelligently with the innocence of boyhood, and the benign, naive side of manhood. This time again there is something similar in the core of the story, but the father seems too dumb and the kid too foreign to any credibility. If Nichols did not intend this story as a metaphor of Jesus Christ's passion (my goodness!), leaving the Holy Spirit out of this plot, then it also leaves an open door: how did this human-like E.T. end up in this world, having too earthlings as parents? I do not know who cares for a sequel, but I do not. The best thing in the film is Joel Edgerton as Lucas."
" Huge Potential Un-used
",2017-09-29 00:00:00,5,"Huge potential in a scifi story that didn't explain it self very well. To many lose ends, very small development of the history and a quick end that leads to a lot of unanswered questions. Personally i think the movie didn't evolve as it suppose to. I like to give a short review and not a huge lecture about my point of view. if you agree with me after watching this movie hit like and follow my short reviews :). (in fact i am writing this because i need a minimum of lines to post.)"
" A different kind of film
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,7,The movie is what you would call a different movie or a fresh movie from the general type of sci-fi movie. The film is an unusual story about a special powered boy and his father struggling against the world and their interpretation of the boy's power. Beautiful cinematography and some cool moments about human understanding of the unusual powers are a highlight. It's a slow paced film with a story which is not for everyone. Highly recommended for sci-fi fans who want a fresh new pick for their sci-fi appetite.

But like writer/director Jeff Nichols earlier film¬†Take Shelter, it eventually fizzled out and ultimately delivered an ending that was annoyingly vague and less than the sum of its parts. Still worth checking out, if only for the performances of its exceptional cast (Michael Shannon, Joel Edgerton, Kirsten Dunst, Adam Driver, Sam Shepard and newcomer Jaeden Lieberher)."

Now that movie is now in heavy rotation on pay TV, more people will get a chance to see this amazing movie with a stellar cast, a good plot, and pretty good special effects.

" Nichols is a remarkable talent, but...
",2017-06-10 00:00:00,6,"I'm not entirely enthralled with this one.For one thing, I couldn't get over the idea it was an extended metaphor about death. My reading was, there are no interdimensional aliens, the kid is just dying, and this is the story of parents letting go. Yes it's couched in the science-fiction tropes, but I saw that as all symbolic. I don't think that's what the movie is about. It's about parental love, and how love sometimes means loosening your grip and letting the beloved move on, and because of the acting it works really well at that level.I could be wrong. (Or I could be right for me and no other human) anyway...lovely shots, great acting, not quite as atmospheric as his others. 6.5 stars."
" A Refreshing, Original Piece of Science Fiction
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,8,"I regret that I still haven't gotten around to see Jeff Nichols' TAKE SHELTER. The reviews from its run on the festival circuit made it sound intriguing but it had zero local presence here and no promotion when it arrived on home release. I'd completely forgotten about it until MIDNIGHT SPECIAL came out. I guess Nichols had gained some clout since 2011 because this one surprised me on the shelf in my local department store. So yeah, I finally got to see what the indie hype surrounding Nichols was all about. Well deserved hype, too. I thought MIDNIGHT SPECIAL was great. It's a science fiction thriller starring Michael Shannon as Roy Tomlin. We're introduced to Roy in the start of the film as he's hiding out with his son in a shady motel room with the windows covered and his friend, Lucas (Joel Edgerton), helping keep watch. The way he keeps his son hidden from view of others and only travels at night you begin to suspect he's kidnapped the boy, and it's not far from the truth. He's stolen his son away from a religious cult that views him as some sort of holy figure due to strange episodes the boy suffers. This cult is the sort that stockpiles weapons and encourages a strong distrust of the outside world, so it can only be leading up to something dangerous. So Roy grabs his son and goes on the run with the government and members of the cult in pursuit.We come to discover that Roy's son, Alton (Jaeden Lieberher), does in fact have some kind of supernatural powers. Roy was a former member of the cult who lost Alton when the boy's powers began to manifest when Pastor Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard), the cult's leader, adopted the boy as his own for use as a tool in his pseudo-religious preaching. Alton has the strange ability to receive encoded satellite signals (among other things) and Roy has managed to decipher information, including coordinates and a date/time, from his son and they've made it their objective to bring him there at the proper time for¬Ö whatever is meant to happen. The government has taken special interest because a lot of the coded transmissions Alton has intercepted are from NSA signals and information from those signals had found their way into Pastor Meyer's sermons. So it's all one big race against time as Roy and Lucas try to bring Alton to the coordinates before government agents can abduct him to one of their secure facilities or Meyer's goons can steal him away back to the compound for whatever it is he has planned for the child. Along the way, Roy reconnects with Alton's mother Sarah (Kirsten Dunst) and finds a potential ally in an NSA communications analyst (Adam Driver). It's a tense run from the heart of Texas to Florida capping with a breathtaking sequence as Alton's true origins and destiny are revealed. MIDNIGHT SPECIAL is suspenseful, often emotional, and full of mystery.I can't help but feel a little bit of an Amblin vibe from this movie. Not in the sense that it's aimed at children or families because I doubt most kids would stomach the slower pacing (and there are a few moments that might be a little too shocking or violent for the especially young). I mean MIDNIGHT SPECIAL feels almost like an E.T. for adults. People on the run with an individual they don't fully understand with the government on their heels and it culminates in a grand finish as the characters accomplish what they set out to do. I really enjoyed the concept of Alton and his background, once the movie started dishing out the details. It was a sharp use of an underutilized sci-fi trope that doesn't seem to get much play. I'll always have a soft spot for creative, unique science fiction tales so MIDNIGHT SPECIAL was bound to hit all the right buttons for me. In addition, it stars Michael Shannon who, as far as I can tell, has been awesome in every role he's done. It serves as a reminder here that I really, really need to check out TAKE SHELTER. I should also compliment the use of CG in the film. This movie was done on an $18 million budget, a fraction of some other movies, and the CG is incredible. It's used somewhat sparingly and, when it's used, it's used to great effect. MIDNIGHT SPECIAL won't appeal to those who need lasers or space battles in their sci-fi, but those of us who appreciate something a little more toned down (action- wise) that relies on its themes and performances, this one shouldn't disappoint."
" Great Film
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,9,"Great film says artist and writer, including screenplay writer, Paul Heidelberg, who lives in a town in NM where some of this film was shot.Yes I had several ""feelings"" that related this film to ""Close Encounters""; after viewing the movie, I read several reviews that mentioned same.I do not want to spoil any viewings, so will not write much more, but want to state some of the special effects and ""Alton's"" acting -- his name is listed at IMDb, but I do not want to lose this searching for it -- and the acting by other cast members was superb."
" Good, but definitely not for everyone.
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,7,"The latest work by up and coming writer/director Jeff Nichols isn't as entertaining as I would have hoped, nor is the more artsy aspect of it particularly avant-garde, but it's a well-directed and beautiful piece of filmmaking. It follows a boy who possesses extraordinary powers as he struggles to find out who - or what - he is, while being chased by both the US Government and a religious cult which has formed around him and sees him as God. I have to admit, the plot is quite linear and doesn't tend to wander off course. However, the course which Nichols has selected isn't, I believe, the most interesting, entertaining or exciting one. The story just goes and goes and goes and goes and then ends quite abruptly. The main positive points of the film were its gorgeous score and minimalist tone throughout. Little emphasis is put on dialogue, which is challenging for the cast, who hold the piece together remarkably well. Nichols' writing is excellent and it is very well shot. The ending is also very emotional and sad in a way. But the luscious ambient score is definitely one of the high points, especially in an era of identikit orchestral fanfares and high-energy strings.8 / 10 (Great). More of a film for a lazy day as opposed to a weekend with your friends, but I get the feeling that having landed Kirsten Dunst, Joel Edgerton, Michael Shannon and Adam Driver - as well as the very talented Jaeden Lieberher - we haven't seen Nichols at his peak quite yet. But, by all means, this bodes well."
" Some people should try to hate lesser
",2017-03-31 00:00:00,8,"Why some reviewers would rate this movie with just one star is just completely ridiculous. That you don't like the movie is one thing, and I can understand that, but that you score it the lowest possible is just too ridiculous for words. To me that means that it must be one of the worst movies you ever saw. And that means that or you didn't watch more than a dozen movies in your life, or that you're a human without any good taste. I opt for the second option. I thought it was an enjoyable movie to watch, with a lot of mystery and only a bit of sci-fi. There could have been more sci-fi to me but I guess that was a budgetary thing. The cast was good. Well at least for me it was. I find all movies with Michael Shannon good. He's just a good convincing actor. And for the eight year old Jaeden Lieberher, I though he did a good job too. He's just a kid so you got to give him some credit. He did fine for his age. The movie is building up slow but it keeps you interested because they don't reveal too much in the beginning so you wonder what the hell is happening and that is good for a movie in this genre. So if you like sci-fi mysteries than you can't go wrong with Midnight Special."
" Long, tedious with little reward
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,1,"Well for a Scifi this is a bit off the mark. Other movies have a similar plot like Fire starter and even Star Man, but they were great movies, this isn't. The dialogue is slow and vague, like paint drying. Father Roy and a couple of others running from the Government because the so called gifted boy Alton Meyer has to get somewhere. There is a religious cult at the start that ends up being a meaningless side line to the plot. When it finally, finally comes to the point where Alton has realized he is a kind of alien, he tells it so slowly that i found myself yelling ""Yes, Well, COME ON, say IT!!"" Really wish i didn't stick it to the end, it wasn't worth it."
" Bipolarity killed the cat
",2017-03-21 00:00:00,6,"Jeff Nichols offers us a concept as trite as well polished. While pretty flat at its core, the self-written script unfolds satisfactorily before our eyes thanks to a pretty good directing and an outstanding photography and sound mixing. The nightly scenery offers us some breathtaking shots and the dark atmosphere allows the use of some clever lightning.But as visually pleasing and ornamented as the film might be, it fails to deliver. Not due to its sub-par visual effects, nor because of the average acting, where no actor offers a poor act yet nor does a single performance glow to salvage the whole film. It's the script's bipolarity that leaves the viewer wondering whether they're being served a fine steak or some leathery meat. Nichols sometimes seems to be willing to take it to a whole new level, introducing some symbolism and even a tad of scientific debate only to return immediately to a mainstream storytelling, excelling in none.Midnight Special is one of those flicks that could have been a milestone in sci-fi, but ultimately falls short and offers a satisfying yet totally unmemorable experience."
" Beautiful, tearful movie with joy and love
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,8,"I don't need a social message subtext to enjoy a movie for what it is, a simple story about a boy with special powers and people (and governments) who want to exploit those powers were it not for his parents and a friend who try to rush the boy off to a destination they've been told is important, been told is where the boy ""needs to be"" but don't understand why exactly - until the father sees an image of another world, the boys world and the boy is healed from what appeared to be a increasingly sick state from being exposed to this world and using his special abilities. The boy further explains that he believes he must be from that special world (how he got to our world isn't really explained nor if he was born biologically to his parents or if they somehow adopted the boy or found him, a la Superman). He explains that his world is built ""on top of this one"", a probable reference to a dual or multiple dimensions where its beings have ""watched us for a long time"". I loved this movie, i felt love from the characters and the boy and i felt like i missed him terribly at the end."
" An Interesting Film that deserves more attention
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,7,"Midnight Special, directed by Jeff Nichols (Take Shelter, Mud), is an interesting science fiction film. It follows two men, who have kidnapped a young boy from a religious cult in the southern United States. The young boy is the key to a prophecy for the cult, but seems to possess strange abilities. The men and the boy flee across the south, trying to reach a specified destination, all while dodging the US government, and thugs sent out by the cult.This was a very well done science fiction film, with a lot to offer. The acting is solid, with some famous and lesser actors doing a fine job with their roles. Joel Edgeton as one of the kidnappers was stood out particularly well. The boy (Alton in the film), was played by Jaeden Lieberher, who was fairly adept in his role, even for a child actor. Some issues were present where the acting felt wooden - Michael Shannon as Roy (the main kidnapper), had some very emotional moments, with great facial tension, but seemed to come up wooden in many of his scenes, for a mixed performance. Kirsten Dunce is also present in the film, and had some great scenes, but had little else to offer the film, joining Shannon in the ""mixed performance"" category.The science fiction in this film is mysterious and engaging at the beginning of the film, as the mystery of Alton and his powers is slowly revealed. However, as the film nears its conclusion, these elements become unappealing. Some of the effects in the film are a bit noticeable, to put it lightly, and this also detracts from the science fiction elements near the end. Both points considered, the strong start in this department leads to a more mediocre conclusion.Cinematography-wise, this film has some really interesting moments. A driving scene at the beginning of the film is taught with suspense, and very well shot as the kidnappers flee down the highway at night. There are numerous more examples of excellent shooting locations and direction throughout the film. These are sometimes tainted by the weaker special effects, with some poor CGI and green screening detracting from an otherwise wonderful shot.All in all, a very interesting film, with some points of detraction. Strong performances overall, with interesting science fiction and excellent cinematography are detracted by a few mixed performances, a weaker ending, and some poor special effects. The story itself would have been stronger had some of the science fiction elements remained ""mysterious"", as opposed to overtly articulated. Even so, the 7 star rating on my communicates the films strong performance, interesting tone, and overall quality. This film is easily recommended to those looking for an interesting science fiction film that is lighter on the laser beams, and heavier on ideas. This is a film that treats its audience with respect, and it shows."
" Needed A Plot Payoff
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,4,"There are a lot of things that need to go right in order for a successful film to be produced. ""Midnight Special"" does most of those things right. However, it is completely negligent on one key area: plot payoff. While the acting performances are solid and the overall plot builds suspense, there is absolutely no payoff in the end.For a basic plot summary, ""Midnight Special"" tells the story of young Alton (Jaeden Lieberher), a boy with special powers of some sort who is highly coveted by the federal government, in particular one man named Sevier (Adam Driver). Because of this, Alton is on the run the entire movie (as viewers are slowly filled in on the ""details"" of his abilities). Along for the journey are father Roy (Michael Shannon), mother Sarah (Kirstin Dunst), and family friend Lucas (Joel Edgerton).There are many things that the film does right. It creates and builds tension/drama, the acting is terrific, and it's a giant mystery in that you never are really quite sure where it is all leading. All of those things combine to create a great atmosphere in ""Midnight Special"".What sabotages the whole product, however, is the fact that nothing is ever explained or makes sense once the credits roll. I understand that you don't always have to ""dot all the i's and cross all the t's"" in a mystery film, but you need to do the basics, and that is where ""Midnight Special"" fails miserably. The whole film structure is a slow ""reveal"", but then you get to the end and nothing (or very, very little) is actually revealed. So, while ""the journey"" may have been fun, not enough of a reward was given in the end to make any of it feel memorable or significant.As much as I want to give this movie a better rating (2.5 would be my exact star rank), as it does so many other things well, I just can't do it because it left me so disappointed upon the conclusion. A perfect example of how the storytelling method itself can often get in the way of what the payoffs need to be in the end."
" The love of a father for his son no matter how strange he is
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,7,Director Jeff Nichols and Michael Shannon team up again for another interesting flick. This one focused on the love of a father for his son no matter how strange he is. Joel Edgerton and Adam Driver turn in equally enjoyable performances. I gave it a 7/10 and recommend checking it out at home next time you are in the mood for something different.
" A slow burning psychological sci-fi drama!!!
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,8,"First off this film may not be for everyone, It doesn't lay all its cards on the table, explaining everything in clear black and white terminology.. This is not an easy going popcorn blockbuster!!! What it is, is a subtle, subliminal yet emotional, psychological sci-fi drama, revealing just enough for you to piece together your own interpretation of what is happening. Even through to my second viewing I found myself noticing lots of key points that I had missed, raising my appreciation further. There is a deep sense of wonder as you ponder the mysteries of the unknown and once again it's what you don't see or understand that makes this film so fulfilling.. I wouldn't go as far as to call it a masterpiece, but it is definitely a highly original and inspirational movie full of abstract concepts about consciousness and the nature of reality. For all these reason I'm gonna rate it a high... 8/10"
" Dull direction, uninvolving screenplay, superior actors
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,5,"""Midnight Special"" is a tedious paranormal tale that explains nothing at the outset and tries to lead you along with sparse bits of information you are supposed to piece together yourself. I can save you the trouble by telling you that the parts add up to nothing very interesting. It's also padded to about two hours, despite being a story ""The Twilight Zone"" could've told better in twenty minutes.The story is about a little boy with spooky powers. The most interesting thing about these powers is how shoddy they look when they finally appear. They reminded me of after school TV shows back in the '90s, like ""Animorphs"".The boy is adopted by a religious zealot played by playwright Sam Shepard. He leads a doomsday congregation with sermons based on the boy's mysterious abilities. The boy is liberated by his natural father, played by Michael Shannon, and another guy played by Joel Edgerton. They take him to the house of a lady, Kirsten Dunst, but the police and the army are hot on their tail. The government employs an agent, played by Adam Driver, for an initiative that wants to catch the boy and use him as some kind of top secret weapon, though against what remains a mystery for those who actually bother to think about these clich√©s. Of the boy's powers, we see little that could work as a weapon, anyway. In fact, we see little that would be of any real use to anyone other than him, so why the government would care about this kid is anyone's guess. It's just what the government is supposed to do in movies like this.I have mentioned that the special effects aren't all that impressive. The direction isn't anything amazing either. With a screenplay that gives so little of interest, the direction needs to carry the show. The script and the direction both feel as though they are relying too much on the other, and neither side holds up. Since the filmmaker also wrote this movie, the blame has to rest on him.Shannon. Edgerton. Shepard. Dunst. Driver. If there is a theme to 2016, it must be actors appearing in material they are superior to."
" Slowness and little else
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,3,"The most striking thing about this film, for my taste, is how slow it is. Count, does not count much. Trust in your faith and in that although you do not have a why the end as you like and that's it.Science fiction I do not know if it is because of the four effects that put you throughout the film and then in the end what you have spent in 3d, but in reality it is neither more nor less than a movie that is not going to any side.There are many minutes of film left. Lots of TV plans.The actors are all contained, which in part is normal, they are not counting much.Photography is not bad, but nothing special.The management, telling that he does not tell much, that he does not know that he is boring, that he does not know how to make beautiful or compound plans, which is not a wonder.In short I love science fiction, but when they are science fiction films."
" Disappointing and not up to the critics' hype
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,4,"Good actors gave terrific performances in a disappointing film. There really isn't much of a story. The film is just an extended chase scene and the little mysteries it presents along the way aren't very compelling. The weak ending reminded me just a bit of Netflix ""Stranger Things"", except in this case the Upside Down could be called the On Top.Some critics described the film as thoughtful scifi (I guess if it's not based on a Marvel Comic, they think it's deep and meaningful), but it was pretty thin - all atmosphere with no underlying theme or substance. It's not up to the level of a really thoughtful scifi film such as Arrival, which leaves its audience contemplating how language can not only be a barrier to communication, but also shape and limit our perceptions of reality.I had great hopes for this film because Nichols' earlier, ""Take Shelter"", was an insightful exploration of the onset of schizophrenia and its impending disastrous impact on an individual and his family. But with ""Midnight Special, it seems as though Nichols is devolving rather than evolving as a filmmaker."
" Bright Lights, Dull Story
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,4,"""Midnight Special"" offers an intriguing premise and an impressive cast, but aside from the sporadic dazzle of otherworldly beams of light, there is little else that shines here.The film possesses a somber tone, not unlike the far superior Nichol's film ""Take Shelter,"" and within this atmosphere Michael Shannon ‚Äî playing the supernatural boy's father, Roy ‚Äî is free to do what he does best: stare into the middle distance broodingly. Unfortunately, the script does not provide sufficient emotional depth for Shannon to draw upon. He's a desperate father who will stop at nothing to protect his ""special"" son. That's really all it boils down to.The typical security and intelligence types of the US government comprise the film's primary antagonists. We're also exposed to a forgettable duo hailing from a religious cult whom regard the young boy as some kind of conduit to a higher power, and so these two under-qualified beige men are burdened with divine purpose: apprehend the venerated youngster. Thankfully, the government types and cult members aren't their typical obnoxious selves, as they're oft-presented in film; nonetheless, they are decidedly vapid and nonthreatening. You won't find here a menacing pursuer such as the likes of Anton Chigurh from ""No Country for Old Men."" The gradual revelation of the powerful, yet fragile young boy's supernatural powers may prove enough to keep a science fiction fan's interest piqued throughout the film ‚Äî considering his feats are equal parts remarkable and ambiguous. Regrettably, the film's climax is rather underwhelming and trite. We're provided with something tangible to marvel at, but much is left unexplained and to the imagination. When room is left to interpret and speculate about a film's ending I'm usually thankful, but here I'm just left feeling short-changed and disappointed by uninspired writing.There may be something to be said about themes relating to parenting, sacrifice, loss, and faith, but the film just wasn't engaging or rewarding enough to warrant my probing it for meaning"
" Michael Shannon ruined every scene he was in
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,3,"I wanted to like this movie. I kept thinking I love this genre and there are some gorgeous shots, what's wrong? And figured it out. Shannon thinks he can get by with the dark and moosy thing, never talking. But he's wrong. His face is anxiety producing. His insecurity seeps through everything he does. He's an abysmal actor who relies on dark and moody. Just skip it and anything he is is. OK I need more text. The guy who played sevier was amazing. A total scene stealer. The state trooper friend was imminently likable. Kirsten dunst was as always brilliant. But forget ever watching boring insecure face act again."
