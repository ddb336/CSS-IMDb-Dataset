" I love this movie, but...
",2021-03-30 00:00:00,10,"I LOVED this movie. Everything but the way they portrayed the British coach of the Swedish team. George Raynor was actually the opposite of the way the movie implied - he was NOT racist and neither was the Swedish team. Raynor was passionate about the game's ability to unite - and he became the first hugely successful foreigner coaching teams at the highest level - in Sweden and Italy - and in reality, he opened millions of people's minds to a bigger picture view of sport as a unifier rather than just my country versus your country. Sweden believed in his message of sports as a way to unify nations and celebrate competition as an alternative to the wars that had devastated Europe in the first half of the 20th century. The movie did show the King & Queen of Sweden cheering equally for both teams in the 1958 final - that was a fact - and a huge deal (it confused a lot of people around the world at the time, who didn't get it). George Raynor deserved way better treatment in this movie.Its true though that Sweden played a rough style of soccer - that was the Scandinavian way and was largely because many played hockey in the winter as kids - definitely the way I experienced soccer as a youngster in America being coached by Scandinavian players of that era. The other fact that the movie left out was that in the dreaded 1950 World Cup (where the movie opens) Brazil defeated Sweden 7-1 in a quarter final match. So both teams were a bit shook by that: Sweden was actually in great fear of Brazil in the 1958 final. While Brazil (the host nation) remembered they had gone far only to get cocky and lose to their neighbor Uruguay in the final, which was mega-embarrassing for them."
" Great movie
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,9,While I'm pretty sure it's not entirely historically accurate it's a great movie and the story of one of the true legends of this world. The soccer scenes are awesome as is the family/heartfelt/countryfelt feel.
" Marvelous job 8/10
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,8,"Pelé: Birth of a Legend is an extraordinary movie, the tale of how Pelé became famous and won with Brazil their first world cup in the 1958 world cup in Sweden. This is probably the most successful movie that focuses on soccer. A true story of a boy with nothing who became the world's greatest soccer player. No famous actors in this film except for Vincent D'Onofrio. But the movie doesn't need famous actors to attract the attention of the viewers, it's beautiful story is what attracted me in the first place. Along with the music composed by A. R. Rahman That follows the emotion and scenes throughout the film. Pelé's legend is worth to be told and has a deep meaning to Brazil's history of soccer and hope of becoming the best. The movie is also a story of restoring honor and hope to a full nation. Only it is sad that today Brazil's soccer team can't be as great as it was back then. So this film brings a lot of nostalgia towards the past and a better hope for the future. I am hoping to see other movies about soccer like this one in the future, maybe a movie about Neymar or Messi."
" The worst movie about any football player ever...
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,1,"Movie is terribly bad... So disappointing.
I do not recommend to waste time on this..."
" A legend that should have been portrayed a lot better
",2020-07-17 00:00:00,5,"Truly disappointed from this movie. They have a living legend with an amazing story and they produced such a cheap movie.
Big mess"
" Terrible
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,1,What a horrific depiction of a legend. These sporting films should always use real footage of the games. I'm not sure what's worse between the acting or the storyline. Cheesy nonsense that provides no insight into an amazing players career.
" If this film was a mango I would bicycle kick it out of its tree
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,3,"I guess this could probably be enjoyable if you have never watched a game of football and have no knowledge of the sport's history. Otherwise, you'll probably be scratching your head at the way this story is depicted. It almost feels like the writers have gleaned their source material solely from Wikipedia. The football choreography is horribly unrealistic and the story is so embellished its basically just a work of fiction.The silly thing is, the actual story of Pele and the 1958 World Cup is so miraculous that it needs no adornment, it just needs to be told. It seems like the writers had to imagine a load of corny scenes and subplots purely to mask their inability to create good cinema. The suggestion that he achieved greatness through a strict training regime of keepy-ups and overhead kicks shows how little care went into this story.Kevin De Paula looks an awful lot like the young Pele and, in that sense, is a great piece of casting. But his dreary hesitancy and vacant expressions don't half get tiresome after a while. Every time he receives the ball, he takes 10 seconds to stop, look around, gain inspiration from the bench and then perform a load of laughably unrealistic tricks that no real footballer would ever even attempt.I will say that this a very nice-looking film; the use of colour is excellent, and De Paula is very striking. The yellow Brazil kit is iconic in the football world and the directors use it nicely here. Beyond that, however, there really isn't much positive to say about this movie. I can't help but feel that the notoriously narcissistic Pele himself had some input into the painfully cheesy writing.There are very few good football movies and Pele: Birth of a Legend is certainly not one of them."
" Heartwarming - it's more than just a game!
",2020-02-29 00:00:00,10,"As a Brazilian I never thought a movie like this one could get me so deep. Outstanding, you can see how life is beautiful and how the biggest football player started. A legend! Must see.
It's more than just a game!!"
" Goal Goal Goal
",2020-02-27 00:00:00,7,It is not really a documentary. It is good. I would recommend this to people interested in football.
" Cliché City
",2020-02-16 00:00:00,2,"Pelé's rags to glory story is worthy of a great film. Sadly, this isn't it. It is badly acted, has every cliché in the book and tells blatant lies when the truth doesn't fit the Hollywood storyline e.g. portraying Brazil as underdogs in 1958, suggesting they were mocked as too small, implying Altafini came from a wealthy background. Pelé was my hero as a boy but this film is not worthy of him or his legacy."
" Inspirational.
",2020-02-01 00:00:00,10,"The best movie ever, because I feel very inspired by this amazing and one of a kind movie."
" WOW
",2019-11-14 00:00:00,9,"There couldn't have been a better word for me for a title but...WOW.Yes, that's the feeling the movie conjures up for me. Simplistic, smooth, emotional and very real. A well-made movie that befits the man behind the name - 'Pele'. When you start watching the movie, you don't really think of it as a movie, but something that you are actually living. For me, personally, football is what I love the most. It made me go back in time and relive my childhood days (happy tears). The struggles one faces in adversity, knowing too well that there was nothing in football for an Indian kid way back in the 90's. We gave up so easily. But for Pele to do what he did in the 1950's is truly remarkable.Humble beginnings to Super Stardom. There isn't a football fan in this world who wouldn't get Goosebumps watching this masterpiece. The emotion, the angst, the struggle, the anger, the sense of pride and finally the sense of achievement - a promise fulfilled. The legend is well captured in this movie and it makes one wonder, what if we were born and lived during those times to watch the Greatest Footballer who has walked this earth! The movie does that to you - it takes you back in time and makes you relive those moments.
The characters have been moulded and play out their part to perfection.
I thoroughly loved the movie and was emotional all through. It made me ponder and regret not having followed my dreams back then, when I could have or should have. But at the same time, through the character of Pele's father - it gives me chance to mould my child and let him believe and achieve his dreams.Thank you to the film makers and a bigger thank you to #pele for being born and giving us hope and strength to believe in our dreams. A definite must watch #football movie for me."
" Don't decide to watch or not on the basis of metascore & rotten tomatoes
",2019-07-08 00:00:00,10,This is one of the best sports movie i have ever watched..this movie is so inspiring & each and every actor have performed really well. I'm shocked after watching ratings on metascore & rotten tomatoes.. don't decide to watch or not on that basis just go & watch this one.. a must watch!!!
" Classic Sport Film: Pele
",2019-07-07 00:00:00,9,"This is the best soccer film ever made by far, and one of the best sport films ever made because of several factors; the production values are much better than the vast majority of other sport films and the list of great sport films is pretty short: they would include 42 (Jackie Robinson), Jim Thorpe, All American, Field of Dreams, A League of Their Own, Fear Strikes Out (Jimmy Piersall), Knute Rockne, Rudy, and the granddaddy of all sport films: Pride of the Yankees. There have been a handful of other good sports films, but generally speaking the afore-mentioned are the best-known and well-remembered. One could also add Babe to the list because of the great job done by John Goodman.
The star of this is not the actors (although the actors, especially the father, give excellent performances. No, the star of this film is the style of soccer that Brazil plays. In American basketball, it would be akin to shake and bake, a description of black playground basketball style that was immortalized by players like Earl Monroe, Allen Iverson, and even Pete Maravich, the best white shake and bake player of all time.
Unlike these hot dogs, who seldom won any championships, Pele won three. That is what puts him above these others. There are all-time greats in every sport who color outside the box, and Pele is the greatest of those.
The characterization of the father is one of the best elements of the film and the mango sequences were mesmerizing. Highly Recommended."
" irrealista
",2019-05-03 00:00:00,4,"No me ha gustado, muy irreal parece que todo es emocionante en todo momento pero no lo es"
" A Hidden Gem!
",2019-04-18 00:00:00,10,"Yes, I know this movie follows every beat of every cliched sports movie about the underdogs. And I know it's a heavily fictionalized version of history.But1. They didn't make that stuff up about the actual World Cup games - that stuff is up on Wikipedia to look up.
2. Football really is that big a deal and part of the culture of Brazil.
3. Pele really was a football wunderkind.
4. My dad used to tell me stories about Pele and his ginga style of play. We're from Bangladesh. A country that is madly in love with Brazil (and also Argentina) every time the World Cup rolls around. Brazil is a huge deal to the people of Bangladesh because here are some folks who look like us, who grew up in the slums, who are beating these white European folks whose ancestors colonized us all.I wasn't expecting it from this movie, but it touches on race relations, class relations, and the effects of the Portuguese colonization in Brazil. The fact that so many of them are mixed race is constantly brought up by the Europeans. (This is the 1950s, so of course it is.) But despite being mixed race, those who are black are aware of their African heritage (and we learn a brief history of the ginga style) and those who are white are aware of their European heritage. The scene were Altafini realizes that the rest of Europe looks down on him for being Brazilian despite his Italian heritage (which may be fictionalized, but probably happened to some other Brazilians at some point) directly spoke to the movie's theme about Brazilian identity. And the underlying theme of ""be yourself; be Brazilian"" was present throughout and somewhat heavy handed.But none of the cliches felt cliched because it was all being applied to a new context. There aren't that many football movies or that many World Cup movies. And there are not that many movies about Brazil.I actually don't even support Brazil that much during the WC because they've won just way too many times at this point! But back then they were underdogs, and this movie shows how they became legends."
" A movie of a 17 year boy creating wonders
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,10,"Pele a must watch movie. An inspiring movie of the legend Pele. A movie showing a person with talent, hard work and vision can create wonders not for himself but also for whole team an of country. Brazil."
" Goal!!
",2019-01-25 00:00:00,8,"Name Pelé is one of the biggest names in footbal history. I think that eveybody must know this name.
Edson Arantes do Nascimento, know as Pelé, is a little boy, who live in a poor part of Brazil. He likes to kick into the ball, playing some ball games with his friends. Some years later, after training with his dad, he join into Santos FC, and afer one year, at age 16 he become a part of a Brazil olympic team. From the start it is tough for young Pelé, because the pressure is unbelievable strong. When your coach don't like your style of play, your teammates are watching you during match, it is really big pressure, trust me. However, when you get into rhythm, nothing can stop you.
Acting wasn't the best part of film, but it wasn't even the worst. Film doesn't have a lot of special effects, just some slow motions, when Pelé have the ball. The film is mainly about not giving up ,hardwork and surpassing your limits and surpass fear. Especially, when you like football, you can feel the pressure from this film. It is really gripping and exciting film. I really enjoyed it."
" Fútbol scenes brought this down
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,6,"I really wanted to give this a high rating. The fútbol scenes totally took me out of the movie with the quick cuts and fancy editing. With modern day technology and great film techniques, I was hoping that the soccer scenes would carry the story to an even better payoff.Besides that, the Pele story is remarkable and fully justifiable for a movie. The history of it was accurate and the acting was great. I just felt a disconnect with it that I didn't feel with well made sports films such as Miracle, Secretariat, The Greatest Game Ever Played. In those movies, the sports action scenes drive the message of the movie even more. Sad that it was missing in this film."
" Pele: Legend are not Born They are MADE!
",2018-12-07 00:00:00,8,"Pele: Legend are not Born They are MADE !
Pele: Legend are not Born They are MADE !"
" Great and inspiring film.
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,10,"Pelé has been an inspiration to thousands of people around the globe for his achievements in football and the way he has motivated so many young boys to pursue their dreams. A great, inspiring and motivating film for all the family."
" Imprecise and Obvious
",2018-10-10 00:00:00,5,"I was expecting a movie exploring a little more than just poverty and dribbling. Not impressed. Pelé and Mazola (Altafini) didn't live in the same town as kids and they were not rivals as the film shows. The arrival at Vila Belmiro, Santos' Stadium, shows it in the middle of a town made 100% of slum. Quite a joke, specially in the early 1950s, when Santos was quite a pleasant place. I liked the acting, specially of Pelé's father. And this ""ginga"" BS. As a Brazilian football fan I say... don't buy it. We have great players, but that is useless without good tactics and discipline."
" A compelling narrative, but factually inaccurate and unfair
",2018-09-16 00:00:00,5,"I want to state first that I do really like Pélé, he is one of the best athletes in history, not only in his athletic performance but also in his conduct outside the pitch.His compelling personality is well displayed and I cannot speak with certainty about his background, but I suspect that while it was challenging it was perhaps not quite as bad as it is displayed at times.My main problem with the movie is the display of the national teams aside from the brazilians. It was at this time and unlike the depiction of the movie well known that Brazil was a good team, perhaps not the favorites to win, but by no means a complete underdog. The favorites to win were West Germany, France and the Soviet Union. Sweden who is antagonisticly depicted was a nation with many players at the very end of their career and though the population was excited at their nations participation and that for the first time (for the swedes) professional players playing in clubs abroad would be permitted to play for the national team. So people were hopeful that with homefield advantage and the addition of a handful of worldclass professionals though perhaps past their prime(Niels Liedholm 36 at the time and Gunnar Gren 38) that maybe possibly Sweden could win.So the primary factual error here is that Brazil was by no means colossal underdogs and the Swedes were not as massively favored as depicted and certainly not as arrogant and demeaning as they are shown. Though there is some truth in their strategy in the final game, the swedes did hope to try and score an early goal hoping the brazilians would be unable to recover.(According to Niels Liedholm).I also find it unfortunate that while racism is horrible and was certainly present even amongst my own swedish ancestors. It is very unfortunate that this media never depicted some of the really inspiring moments of people in this tournament. Because in the end Pélé have stated that the swedish king at the time went down to meet the players on both sides and shook everybodys hand and chatted with them regardless of what they looked like. For many people just like the king football have no color and whilst Péle has had to deal with his fair share of racism he has seldom dwelt on the negative, but almost always uplifted the positive.For my parents who vividly remember this tournament and who have always held Pélé in very high regard as both a footballer and a person. It was rather difficult to swallow the depiction of his opponents(our national team in particular) and that of the tournament as a whole which is perhaps one of the most memorable world cups in history with Pélé the 17-year old wunderkind and Just Fontaine who set a record of scoring goals that to this day stands."
" Great soccer movie
",2018-09-14 00:00:00,9,Big fan of pelé and thought the movie was great.Good way of showing his live and was also shocked those all the things he had been through.
" Good
",2018-09-08 00:00:00,8,Good one to show it to kids. At rahman music is very much strength for this movie
" You need a montaaaaaaaaaage....
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,3,"Imagine every cliche you've ever seen in a sports film made to pander to an American audience.
Now imagine someone pretending to be Pele in the middle of all that.
Congratulations. You've just saved yourself 100 minutes of your life.
It's too late for me. I'm never getting them back.
Save yourself."
" Pelé didn't deserve this movie
",2018-07-14 00:00:00,1,"I grew up having Pelé as my greatest hero, the closest figure to the Superman i've ever seen. I thought this movie would be a Pelé's biography, but I was totally disappointed, not only by the cliches, but also by the incredible mistakes about his history. Pelé was already a star in Brazil in 1958. He. didn't play the first two games in that World Cup because he was recovering from an injury. He was nationwide recognized as Pelé, not as Dico Nascimento. Feola wasn't the mean guy as shown in the movie (by the opposite, in fact) and so on. 
Don't waste your time."
" Great soccer movie
",2018-06-25 00:00:00,9,A great movie to understand the beautiful game. Really well done!
" Very inspirational
",2018-05-17 00:00:00,10,Very inspirational. Absolute outstanding talent portraited very well here in this movie
" not good
",2018-04-30 00:00:00,2,"Not well made movie, Clichés after Clichés, emotion compassion.
Pelé deserve way better than hat. Don't waste your time.
typical Hollywood movie"
" Stretched beyond necessity
",2018-04-19 00:00:00,3,"What could have been a really great movie was ruined by ill-timed and lengthy flash-backs and entirely too many gratuitous slow-motion edits, and choppy camera work. Had the movie been created by seasoned professionals, it would have been 50 minutes long, instead of an hour and half plus."
" A Good Football film that needs to be seen!
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,7,I did enjoy this film on many levels and it ticks the boxes for the audience this film targets! The music makes it's presence felt and I looked up the composer: no other than AR Rehman! I am buying the DVD and the CD once they are out!
" The Ginga Game
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,5,"Pele was a great footballer, he won three World Cup with a Brazil that played an exciting and extravagant form of football known as Ginga.This films charts what to me is a fictionalised account of his boyhood days playing football in the poor area of São Paulo that seems to be cliched to the extreme. Being made fun off by the white kids for playing football with his bare feet. Then later on being criticised for his flamboyant style of football.The film comes to life as see the rise of Pele in the 1958 World Cup in Sweden where he played at the age of 17 and still remains the youngest player to score at a World Cup final.It is a rather superficial film, it only concentrates on Pele up to his first World Cup win. The young actor playing Pele shows great football skill. Some of the recreations are well done and the great man himself makes a little cameo experience."
" Only a small portion of Pelé's great story
",2017-08-22 00:00:00,5,"Pele's rise from the slums of São Paulo to Brazil's first World Championship conquest at the age of seventeen is portrayed in this biographical drama.The story of Pelé goes much beyond his 17 years and the formidable conquest of Brazil's first World Cup. While the film serves to get a sense of how the slum's kid became an instant legend, it's only a small portion of his great story. One decision that I consider terrifyingly unfortunate is that although the actors are mostly Brazilian, the language used is English, which removes part of the realism and authenticity of the film and almost seems to have been 'dubbed' in a really bad way: it becomes very distracting and certainly downgrades the acting! The dialogues are very bad especially in the first half of the film and surely the writers used some 'historical freedom' for cinematic effect. A very positive point is the cinematography full of vivid colors. On the other hand would have preferred a less Hollywoodian style and a more traditional one, but taking into account the target audience I understand that decision. Good as entertainment and even an inspirational film, but I do not know to what extent it is a totally reliable biography, even with Pelé himself among the producers - always keep in mind the cinema industry' shenanigans regarding 'historical accounts'.I know it's not a documentary and it's just a movie serving well its purpose for entertainment, but it's also far from being the ultimate videobiography, at least for me. So, while I consider this movie to have many problems and truly feel like rating it 4/10, as a fan of 'the most beautiful game in the world' and due to its inspirational tone I'll give it a pass and score it 5/10. - pun intended ;)"
" Wonderful film not just for Football fans
",2017-06-22 00:00:00,10,"This is a truly wonderful film that all the family can watch. Kevin de Paula is excellent as Pele and all the supporting cast were just brilliant. the early parts of the movie were very entertaining and showed Pele's early life with his friends and the antics they got up to. There are some truly funny moments and also some sadness. The actors who played members of the Brazilian football team were first class and looked like they could genuinely play, but Kevin de Paula's skills were outstanding and it was like looking at the real Pele.Over all a wonderful movie about a man for whom the word legend really does apply.Loved this movie so much and I am sure I will watch it many times."
" Did I watch a Disney story?
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,6,"I really started watching this movie to know something about the story of this football legend... But... Is this the real story? Honestly, a lot of fantasy. If this story is true I can say Disney stories exist in the real world. So, its not a biography movie, its a very good inspirational/fantasy movie maybe with some seasoning of a real life story. And why, why in the name of god they made a Brazilian movie in English? WHY??? 2 less points for that... Movie message: We are proud to be what we are, Brazilians. You must be proud of what you are no matter what... But we made the movie IN English??? No dude... Why???So... 10 - 2 (not in Portuguese) -2 (lot of fantasy) = 6 points. A movie to see and enjoy and say at the end ""Did this story really happened like this""?"
" Ginga or Joga Bonito, both mean: Pelé
",2017-03-30 00:00:00,8,"I grew up watching Football, i loved it and i still do, and of course i love my nation (Venezuela), but you just can't denied that you like Brasil for their style of playing, their amazing Joga Bonito, it's just masterful and beautiful that makes you think, can i do that?, there are 2 correct answers: you work all day, every day for a very long time to accomplish it, or just wait until another life and born with it like Pelé. This is the guy that every Football player looks up to at least one time in their life, and of course for us Fottball lovers to know there is a movie about this legend it's like saying, there is a movie about Michael Jackson and you think: They better don't mess it up, because he is the best in the business and he deserves it. Trust me they have done it right in this film, the kid playing Pelé is really good with his ginga (freestyle of playing) and does honor to the man himself, he really capture the essence of what he means to every fan, player and Brazilian in the world. Makes me think, can he have Pelé's blood, yes he does, but not by family, but by nationality, they just have it in them.The movie it's solid in the cinematography, it really shows the feeling of the country and their culture and the sport itself, the casting made me think some times about overacting, but i just forget about it and kept watching a great film. What i really loved is that Ginga is explained and gives real knowledge of what it means, it's now that they call it Joga Bonito, but they are the same: One amazing player. Donpt believe me? just take a good look yourself this movie and experience what Soccer (that's how Americans call it) it's really about, and you will have the most amazing teacher, Edson Arantes do Nascimento, or as is best known: Pelé."
" A football film for everyone, for the whole family, but maybe not football fans
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,6,"This is a family film more than a football film. In case you were unaware, family films are not just movies that can by watched by anyone of any age, but specific genre film that can be watched by everyone at the same time, as in a family, often at home.As such, don't expect much depth or drama. There is a death, but it's early on so that it doesn't ""hurt"" too much. The Lion King and Bambi had early deaths too. This is just like that. The story has a lot of clichés, poor-vs-rich, black-vs-white, South America vs Europe, players too poor for shoes, children committing minor theft, parents against the game (but then changing their minds), Pele's style criticized (but then it turns out to be the best style), the bad (evil, not quality) players turning good, child Pele promising to win the World Cup for his crying dad, practicing with fruits, etc. I'm not going to list them all, but if there is a cliché in this film, they most likely have used it.Although they are clichés, it's not a bad thing that they mentioned them. The rich-poor divide is real, so as the racial divide in Brazil, but this film doesn't shy away from these issues. It comes out as a Brazilian nationalist film ""We're all Brazilian, rich or poor, black or white, born here or elsewhere"" but it's more heartwarming than chest-thumping. Europe still thought of South America as a colony and Italy, for example, was notorious for poaching South American players with Italian heritage to play for the Italian national team. The even poached previous world cup winners from Argentina, which is illegal now.This film is more like one of the many films of orphans or street kids doing cute things, but with a football flavor.I don't blame this film for this family-oriented direction. Brazil also made a dark football film, Heleno, but it did not receive a lot of success. The family-oriented market is a lucrative one. Watch Heleno if you want a real biopic about a footballer, even though there's even less football there.If you like a feel-good family movie about the adventures of street kids, watch Bekas (2012).If you want a football movie from the same era (also set in South America in the same time period) then watch Montevideo: Taste of a Dream (2010).These are my wine-pairing recommendations.As for Pele: Birth of a Legend, it is what it is, a cute, family football film about poor kids that speak English. The fact that they speak English tells you about the target audience more than anything my review ever could."
