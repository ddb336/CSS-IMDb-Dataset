" What a film
",2021-04-11 00:00:00,8,"Everything I want in life is in this film: extramarital, nubile teen love making and menage a trois. The girl rides him with a hiked school uniform. And all for free!What a dream.Best film since Casino Royale."
" Underrated Gem
",2021-04-10 00:00:00,8,I loved it. It's not a great movie but there's so much to love here. Keanu and the girls are fire! Perfect example of brilliant actors carrying a terrible script.

" Eli Roth remakes a movie that wasn't even that good to begin with, and somehow makes it worse
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,4,"Set on Fathers' Day weekend, successful architect Evan Webber (Keanu Reeves) prepares for a weekend of work while his wife and kids enjoy a weekend at the beach. On his first night home during a rainstorm two young women Bel and Genesis (Ana de Armas and Lorenza Izzo) arrive at his doorstep asking for help. After he allows them in the two seduce Evan resulting in a threeway. After Evan's infidelity, the two reveal their true intentions wreaking havoc on Evan's home and life and subject Evan to increasingly intense psychological and physical tortures which may culminate in his death.Directed by Eli Roth Knock Knock is an uncredited remake of 1977s Death Game (though the original director and stars are executive producers). Knock Knock hits all the beats from the original while also updating the premise with references to contemporary society and technology. I honestly didn't like Death Game when I saw it because I found the plot repetitive and the characters annoying, but I did give it props for being a well made attempt by an inexperienced director and having a chilling performance from Sondra Locke. Knock Knock is certainly more polished of a product in terms of film making in comparison to its more grind house level predecessor, but while the package has been glossed up the content is considerably lesser this time around.The opening 40 minutes are easily the best part of Knock Knock as we establish Evan's sexual frustration and hectic family situation that build up to the seduction. It's honestly really well told and is much better here than it was in the original 1977 film where the wife and kids were basically non entities for much of the original film's runtime. The film is also well shot with great looking establishment shots of the house.Unfortunately beneath the coat of polish that's been applied many elements have been downgraded in terms of quality despite a supposedly more experienced director, Roth, helming the remake of a film that was made by an amateur. Keanu Reeves is a good actor, but only if given the right material. Reeves in Knock Knock does have a fun brief shining moments such as scene midway through the movie where he's trying to rebuke the advances of the seducers, but it feels like the role was written with someone like Nicolas Cage in mind and they just shoehorned Reeves into the role because they couldn't get him. Reeves still sporting his John Wick doo just doesn't sell it as a workaday family man and doesn't sell a role that he just doesn't fit into.Ana de Armas and Lorenza Izzo start off well enough as the seducers when they first arrive in the movie, but around the halfway point where they reveal their true intentions they become absolutely insufferable to listen to. Not only do they act like oversexed brats with middle school level vocabularies, they have this unearned sense of ""holier than thou"" moral superiority that makes them extra aggravating. While movies with killers with prideful moral superiority complexes can work, such as Kiefer Sutherland as The Voice in Phone Booth or Tobin Bell as The Jigsaw Killer in Saw, those movies at least had some level of self awareness that their killers were hypocritical scum doing ex post fact justifications of their actions. Knock Knock is more confused and feels like it muddled its intentions much like Nicolas Cage's Wicker Man remake where they replaced the Paganism/Christianity dynamic with a fundamentally confused masculinity/femininity dynamic. Roth tries to update the very 70s counterculture girls with updated equivalents for the digital age, but it comes off more as an excuse for Roth to amp up the annoyance of characters who were already pretty grating to begin with.Knock Knock is Roth at his worst. While it's not as bad as his worst movie, Hostel Part II, by virtue of at least being unintentionally fascinating in some confusing choices it's still an unnecessary remake of a very flawed movie that is not approved upon save for technical details. It's not completely without merit thanks to some decent cinematography and brief moments of good acting, but if you have a choice between this and the original, stick with the original, for all its flaws it at least had the excuse of an inexperienced director."
" Why all the hate? Solid psych/drama
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,6,"I think everyone that rated this movie poorly expected an Eli Roth film to be grotesque and gory. This is neither. Rather, it was a psychological thriller with a cringe-worthy outcome. The acting is superb...Keanu Reeves shines as do the supporting cast. Well directed and executed. It had my attention from beginning to end, and given my penchant for getting distracted with other things during a horror film, that is a compliment. But...this is NOT horror. I think that is why a lot of people hated it. Eli Roth's name is synonymous with the visually disturbing, so if that is what you are after, skip this one. I think this was his segue into something different, and he totally pulled it off. If you love psych drama this is for you. If you after jump scares and gore, skip it. I went in without expectations and enjoyed it."
" 000
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,1,"Like most people here, I like Reeves. He doesn't have a ton of range, but what he's done, he's done well. This wasn't one of them! One rule of making you root for a protagonist is to make them likable. Well, he seemed a good dad, and husband, but you get 15 minutes of him playing 'Monster,"" in a cringeworthy performance with his kids wasn't enough for me to be endured to the guy, but ok. Home alone now, two hot horney girls wearing nothing come to your front door and ask to come in from the rain. I was waiting for the cliche, ""Our car broke down and we were wondering......"" You know guys, when you're all alone, hot horney girls show up your houses soaking wet on a rainy nights all of the time, right?? Ok, so he's stupid, but a nice guy and lets them in. Me? I'd have given them a couple of towels, the use of my cell phone to call a cab, some warm clothes and had them wait on my covered porch. Sounds uncool? Well, maybe it's just my advanced age but I know all it would take is for one of these low life total strangers to scream rape, and life over! Moving on. These girls soap up, and seduce him in his bathroom. I never saw that coming. (Sarcasm). Ok, now I'll let them spend the night! He gets rid of them only to have them come back the next night. One......one of the girls overpowers John Wick, destroy his house, somehow dig a hole deep enough to fit a grown @ss man in it. Now me? It'd have taken me a Day to dig that hole, but ok, they had jack hammers. Calling 911 fails, because when you call 911, and say something like, ""HELP,"" and hang up, they'll just go about their business. (More sarcasm.)Now without so much as having a punch being thrown your friend dies, and these damsels bury you up to your head in your back yard. Now I'm not built like Reeves, and I have a bad back, but I'd put up one hell of a fight, but, oh, he has a bad shoulder. I only watched out of sheer curiosity to see just how much dumber the film would get. Well, I wasn't disappointed. He's left there, the two terrorists get away, and his life is screwed. It's the last time Eli Roth will get me.... Again. Please spare yourself!!!!! Stay away from this film, unless you're watching it for comedic value, or want a study in how to Lampoon."
" WTF
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,1,"This was a horrible movie, that first dragged on, then instead took a strange, disturbing turn and ending. Not recommended, would not watch again."
" A fun but terrible film
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,5,"""It was free pizza!"" Besides the terrible and obviously scripted acting, this movie is stupidly entertaining. Keanu was so unconvincing and monotonous, it was funny. The message of the plot is disturbing, and the conclusion left more to be interpreted rather than being definitive. It is not a film to watch for quality, but it is a wacky hell of a time."
" I'm disgusted by how far it goes
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,1,"Do yourself a big favor and skip this movie, it's a piece of trash"
" Keanu at his best
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,2,In this movie we see Keanu's full potential as an actor...
" Keanu Reeves character was clearly taken advantage of.
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,10,Those women in the movie deserve to be put in the ground. Regardless of rights they deserve to be sentenced to the harshest punishment.
" Watch and Judge For Yourself... If you like adult thrilling movies give it a try.
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,8,As a gay man. I had to see it cause of Keanu and I had a feeling by cover art these were gonna be twisted individuals creating crazy mayhem. I just didn't realize how far they would go... I enjoyed how off the wall they were . I honestly enjoyed the ride i went on in this movie. Honestly all the bad reviews are two reason's there prudes or they don't want to admit they bought a ticket to this thrill ride. Cause let's be honest by the title its obvious what psychological wheel house this movie is.
" :(
",2021-03-16 00:00:00,2,It's a joke. This movie doesn't be called a movie.
" Literally a torture to watch
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,1,"This is - without exaggeration - one of the worst, dumbest and most pointless movies ever made in the history of mankind.
Compared to this, a movie like ""Killer Klowns from Outer Space"" seems like a decent Oscar nominee.
I don't get how Keanu Reeves, after playing blockbusters like the Matrix, saw this script and said ""Oh hey that sounds like a really good movie, I'm gonna do it"".
I really can't put this movie into words, its basically like watching a two hour car crash accompanied with polka music. Terrible, boring, annoying and just leaves you angry that you spend the time watching this, instead of just doing a nice hike into nature.My honest opinion: Don't - just don't."
" This Movie is a wake up call
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,8,"With all due respect to the haters of this movie , I strongly disagree with them , The Movie highlights on how Loyalty and True love to your family should be something permenant , Never cheat , If you truly love someone , never cheat on him / Her Specially if you have a Family
Evan needed that lesson
Atg the same time his wife needed a lesson aswell"
" Dear Keanu..
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,3,"I usually never type a review and I think this is my first one
I do watch movies quite a lot and I am criticizing them from time to time (at least when I feel the need to) but as I said I have never posted a movie review here but I do feel the need because of this movie... this movie hurt me personally.
Keanu.. since the matrix, speed and the devil's advocate I've been a fan of yours, and see you acting in such a great action movie like john weak gives me joy I can't express. Generally, I know you are one of the most charming people in Hollywood with a tear-dropping life story, and even after all of this you are unpretentious, lovely and there is just no way to dislike you.
So please tell me why in the god's name you have read the script more than a couple of times showed it to your agent and family and came back to the director of the movie and said: ""I'll do the part"", I think no one can understand how a decent movie works more than the people who play on it. So how and for the love of god tell me how did you said yes to a movie that looks like a god damn disabled person just tried their best to make the most irrational and nonmotivational actions for the sake of ""things that happens in my movie"" you have a great career as an actor and after all of your experience I can't believe this psychopath director convinced you to play in this horrible movie.
For the protocol I know this is a movie review and not talk to the actor gameshow but I've just finished that movie and I had to puke this terrifying experience somewhere."
" Boring, bad dialogue
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,1,"One of the worst movies ever, with stupid plot, boring dialogues and super slow happenings. I fast forward so much, but even that felt slow.
Keanu Reeves at his worst as well."
" Honestly
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,1,"What the hell is this bs movie? What on earth?
It's one of those trash movie that the more you watch the more you hate.
Everything sucks."
" Torturous.
",2021-02-26 00:00:00,4,This film is an hour and half of watching an innocent man being tortured. That's literally the movie. Don't waste your time.
" Not worth the watch.
",2021-02-23 00:00:00,1,I love Keanu but this movie was complete trash. Not worth the time wasted on it.
" Beyond stupid and not even remotely believable...
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,1,"As a huge Keanu Reeves fan I can't believe what an utter piece of crap this movie was. Bad story, bad writing, just totally stupid and beyond unrealistic."
" What did I just watch
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,2,"2 girls show up. Basically force themselves on the guy (he does consent, so technically yeah he still shouldn't have done it). Then terrorize the guy and kill his art dealer. This left a living room full of people asking why we chose this movie, then followed up by looking up its cost and whatnot. For 2.5 million I'm surprised they made their money back."
" DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,1,"I lost my time watching this movie. It's like a piece of s***. Why does Keanu Reeves accepted this stupid role?! I can't believe! DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE, IT'S A WASTE OF TIME!!!!!! I can't believe... what a shame"
" Please, believe me...
",2021-02-18 00:00:00,1,"I want to save you time, confusion and annoyance. This movie is absolutely awful! Really, really dumb. We kept watching because we thought for sure it was going to get better, but my God, it was torturous. I don't write movie reviews, but I'm all about helping people. Just don't!!!"
" What a ridiculous film
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,2,I was so frustrated by this movie. I mean why the heck couldn't John Wick deal with two little girls?
" Keanu reeves
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,3,"You were my john wick man
When did you becom so pu**y"
" Lame John Wick
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,3,"At the start of this film it had my curiosity. As the film continued dragging on I became bored. I was expecting Keanu Reeves, character to fight back which never happened. Only good scene in this film, is the nude Ana de Armas scene. The ending was not satisfying either. Seeing Keanu's character stuck, in a hole never getting a chance to fight back. The death of his friend Louis, seems to be forgotten throughout the film as well."
" Terrible
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,1,"Worst movie ive seen in years. The plot could have worked if someone else wrote it better, but the characters were incredibly unbelievable and absurd. I would have turned it off if my wife wouldnt have been watching it"
" Unbelievable
",2021-02-11 00:00:00,7,"This was amazing, like I mean totally.
Don't miss it."
" Worst movie ever
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,1,This movie doesn't make any sense. Only a sick mind would have ever imagined such scenario! I wish zero stars existed so I could rate it properly!
" women predators. so people dont like it
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,8,"In this planet nobody likes movies where women are bad and abuse men.so everybody hates it and gives it low scores.
Good movie showing the entrapment of a married man"
" This is a downright terrible movie but.......
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,2,Ana de Armas gets naked around the 35 minute mark and that's the only redeeming quality.
" well acted but utterly pointless
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,3,"Eli Roth does another remake of some movie that at times i can give highest points to like a reverse ""Funny Games"" but its not really that entertaining. pretty much a waste of time."
" -2 stars
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,1,"I honestly cannot believe I watched the whole thing, and I want my hour and a half back."
" Just don't watch
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,1,"Fact: this film had three writers. God bless them to make more meaningful films.o_o. If I were the writer of this film, I would have left the cinema twenty minutes before the end of the film"
" It was ok
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,7,"It's definitely not the remake but as is, it's entertaining. The actors play their parts well and the pacing's good enough to keep your attention. Particularly the nude scenes. The story's pretty interesting. It's nice to see the original actress Colleen Camp make a cameo in the film. I do t have much to say other than it's ok. Not great, just ok. If you want something mindless and full of fan service, this's the movie for you."
" 0*
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,1,"Sick movie with no reason at all. Wrong ending aswell, the hoes should be killed and the truth restored."
" Waste of their talent and our time
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,1,"We like keeanu reeves and usually enjoy his movies. but KK is a total piece of trash exploiting every emotion the viewer has. my wife and i actually felt intensely disturbed watching this. viewing a thriller should provoke excitement, fear and maybs some apprehension as the hero battles the bad guys. think 'Die Hard'. this movie does none of that. we stuck with it anticipating the end but the ending was as bad, maybe worse, than the film itself. do not waste your time."
" Depraved but makes you think
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,4,"I did not enjoy this movie and do not need to watch it again, but it was an effective movie. This is how I feel about almost all of Eli Roth's films, which are mostly depraved, but force you to look at tough moral quandries.Even the most milquetoast individuals, portrayed very well in this case by Keanu, have insane fantasies that look something like the first 20 minutes of this movie. The rest of this movie shows what happens when we indulge those fantasies; usually depravity and horror ensues. Maybe you glance at your wife with a smile while you're really thinking about hooking up with the hot girl in the yoga pants...Have you ever followed that scenario to its logical conclusion? What would you stand to lose? This movie, while almost absurdly overdone, makes you wonder.There are also subtle winks and nods to the debauchery of Hollywood and how they ""use girls"" and toss them aside. This is interesting because it was right only a year or two before news about Weinstein finally broke out. You have to wonder if Roth was signaling some disdain with the perverse Hollywood crowd. Maybe that's a reach.
To the mechanics of the film, the plot is insanely far fetched and aside from Keanu, the acting was awful."
" Terrible
",2021-01-12 00:00:00,1,"Wtf, the lady is eating her breakfast in the dogs bowl????!!!!!"
" Wow..
",2021-01-12 00:00:00,1,I could defecate in my hand and it would look better than this movie.
" An awful movie
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,1,"Movie is awful. Name being casted are good but performance is awful. I am very dissapointed. Keanu is horrible, so is his movie wife. Unknown motives by 2 stranger girls...i mean, never ever again."
" Worst movie ever
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,1,"I love Keanu, but this movie is cringgggee. The end should've had a better ending. Waste of time."
" Nasty Girls
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,8,"I love you. Gorgeous, natural, thin and makes you fantasize and hope they will visit you. What a film and gives you a brunette and a blonde and they can be yours and you can suck on their sweet nectar until your still attractive wife can come home. total fantasy two hours and you even get a naughty teen uniform in bed.
Easy 8/10."
" If only i could give this movie 0 stars
",2021-01-08 00:00:00,1,Giving this movie one star would be considered very generous. What a waste of time. If you actually watch and enjoy this movie you are definitely in need of serious therapy.
" DO NOT WATCH
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,1,"Do not watch, build a puzzle or play your favorite board game instead."
" Complete waste of time.
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,2,"""Teenagers run the world"" would have been a more appropriate title. The 2 women perform the devils work with absolutely no consequences. If you're waiting for vindication, the movie will leave you flat. Not a typical Eli Roth film, as our villain's stroll off into the sunset.The plot is ridiculous, the acting sub-par and Reeve's character is unbelievably gut-less. Boobies don't carry movies. Next."
" The rewards of a kind man
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,8,"This is a very good film.
A helpful man who wants to help and renders assistance without expecting anything in return is compensated with everything a hetero man could want. He is given a menage a trois, eye candy, school girl fantasy satisfaction and is not going to be blamed by his wife because he was forced into it."
" Monkey Business
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,1,"I regret watching this movie, and the only reason I finished it is that I was waiting for a twist that would have made it somewhat watchable. Wrong! The movie is what it is...stupidly ruinous. Keanu's acting was distracting because his eyes almost never matched the emotions he tried to convey. The girls far, far outacted him in eyes alone. They acted crazy, they looked crazy. He looked like he was trying too hard. Otherwise, this is a story about a man who sets weak, permeable boundaries that lead to his destruction. He tries to be nice to the GIRLS, rather than protect the vows and responsibilities to his FAMILY, which is stupidly dangerous. His continued inability to set boundaries and stick to them renders him morally helpless early on. He doesn't really worry about protecting his family until the girls threaten to hold him accountable for what they say he did, which was another opportunity to do the right thing, which he again failed to do. The number of times he could have walked away, taken control, escaped, or followed through on calling for help was stupifying. He even seemed to worry more about his wife's artwork than his wife. Forty-three-years old, yet no perspective about what was most important when important things were on the line, and almost no ability to react intelligently to danger, once he finally noticed it. If all men acted this way, women would absolutely rule the world.If the moral of this movie is that men are forever weak and stupid when temptation pays an unexpected visit, then the movie's a hit, I suppose. However, there are men out there who would set firm boundaries early on, like the girls hoped, and the ruin would have been avoided. My takeaways? Don't fight evil with politeness when you see the first signs. Believe people's actions, not their words. If they don't respect your boundaries (marriage, children), then they don't care about you and wish to do you and your family harm to varying degrees. No need to keep them around to find out how far they'll go. Trying to be the good guy in times of temptation gets you nowhere you won't regret later. Trying to cover up sins, misdeeds, or broken vows by getting in deeper makes you even more the fool and under someone else's control. Keanu handed over the reins of his life to two girls who were smarter and much more determined than him at every turn. Also, repeatedly begging for mercy from evil gives it what it wants. Have some self-respect or, if acting, shed some tears and be more believable about it. He never should have taken this role because he should have known it wouldn't be a good fit. If he was trying to stretch his abilities or try something new, I'm glad he got the experience(?), but it did nothing for me as a viewer. I'm not a fan or an anti-fan. I had no expectations either way, yet he managed to disappoint them.No one will probably end up reading this, and that's OK with me. I just had to vent a little after watching. I pathetically hoped the wife had hired the girls to test him over the weekend based on a comment she made in the beginning, and they somehow ended up being psychos, but no. I hoped the girls had escaped from an asylum or psychiatric treatment, etc., but no. In the end, the saddest part for me was when they stole Monkey. The most ridiculous part for me was when Keanu accidentally liked the Facebook video. The stupidest part for me was when he did almost everything else. He didn't even play a good monster!!!"
" Hated it
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,1,"Without a doubt, one of the sickest movies I've ever seen"
" Full of surprises
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,7,This film's purpose is clear what its intention are meant to be. There seem to be a large amount of unnecessary negative reviews and low rated scores. However this film was as expected if not slightly better.This isn't anything Oscars intended but is quite an enjoyable invasion torture type thriller. There are some predictable moments but things which still keep you in your feet waiting for what next to occur. The three leads all do good work but this film seems lower than what Keanu Reeves would do. Preferably fur a lesser known actor. Knock Knock came out after the first John Wick but have not looked up how long this film was filmed in advance.It somewhat ends abruptly and surely could have ended differently but it was the right ending (letting the girls leave freely without getting caught/dead/arrested). This ending typically wouldn't occur in more mainstream films as most writers and studios want to secure a more happy ended.
" fun movie that is not to be taken seriously
",2020-12-28 00:00:00,7,"This movie makes me think of what I would do in Evan's situation. How many men would be able to resist the temptation to sleep with two young and beautiful women if they threw themselves at you? Evan says in the movie, it was free pizza. But even with the risk of losing their wife and kids in a divorce due to cheating, most men probably would not be able to resist this type of temptation."
" Required watching for us men
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,8,"Most men including myself know the feeling of being tempted. What most men don't think about are the potentially awful consequences. This movie leans into that hard. If you cheated, how would you get rid of the girls? Keanu's actions were at time dumb but mostly believable. It descends in utter, terrifying madness.If I ever have a daughter, when the groom asks me for permission to marry her, I'm going to say ""sure...but watch this movie with me first"".I do agree the ""silliness"" of the girls could've been toned down. This movie would've been even creepier."
" I feel sorry for Keanu.
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,1,"So, so, very bad. Bad beyond words. The preview had me thinking this would be a great suspenseful movie, a sexy thriller. Instead it left me feeling sorry for Keanu that he even took this role. Now I have to go watch John Wick so I can respect him again."
" the only reason anyone rated this higher than a 1 is because the girls are so hot
",2020-12-25 00:00:00,1,"This movie is complete and utter garbage. The only good reviews mention how hot the women are. This movie is absolutely unwatchable, the only reason I watched it thru the end is because I am quarantining and have literally nothing better to do. Only watch this if you have way too much time on your hands.Yes the women are super hot but that's not a reason to rate this higher than a 1! I hope Keanu enjoyed working with these two beautiful women because I can't see any other reason why he'd make such a horrendously bad movie."
" Painfully BAD
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,1,"I don't even know where to begin. Keaunu's hairdo that is more appropriate on a man half his age. His nauseatingly phony family. The nasty, unsexy girls. The bad writing. The tired plot that was old 40 years ago. The only scary thing about this film is the fact that Keanu has the most womanly nipples of the three. The only people who liked this movie are 30 year olds living in their mother's basement. They got to see bewbies.This movie is so bad it has dozens of fake reviews and downvotes for those who criticize it."
" The Genesis of my Dertry

",2020-12-20 00:00:00,1,"Could be the worst movie I've seen. Netflix has decided that their viewers will enjoy movies with sad endings.
Wrong."
" horrible
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,1,"Ive read other reviews here. first off, i dont think the two girls were that hot nor attractive. second, they had overpowered reeves's character for the whole movie ?? come on...then he deserves what he got..."
" Worst Movie ever
",2020-12-17 00:00:00,1,"What made this movie the worst ever in my opinion is that this could have been a good movie if only they have a good ending. The ending disrespects family, values, and just wasted the time of the people hoping to have atleast a better ending to justify the movie. A person who values family will not accept such ending.
Hope they will avoid making movies like this."
" It goes nowhere
",2020-12-16 00:00:00,3,Easily the worst movie I've seen this year. I kept waiting for the plot to thicken but it never does - it could have been a 5 minute short film with the amount of story it has. The only two things it's got going for it is Keanu Reeve's hilarious monologue and obviously the 2 hot girls. While it's not boring...it goes absolutely nowhere and very little of it makes sense.
" No reason for so much of this
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,4,"I enjoy Keanu and Ana in so many things, but this movie made very little sense.The ladies show up after trying every house (which they mention before and after things get crazy) yet they know a whole lot about his family specifically.He gets stabbed in the shoulder and then is seemingly fine.There is no real motivation ever given for why they're doing this.""Genesis"" uses the R word multiple times, which hasn't been acceptable in a long time in movies. It's not edgy or cool, it's just outdated and gross.I have seen 5 Eli Roth movies and one tv series without liking any of them. This puts a stamp on that for sure."
" I hope the girls didn't spend too much time scouting locations
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,8,"I want to be of service so I will volunteer my address, girls.
You can ring my bell!
Only complaint about this lovely film: not enough graphic scenes."
" Starts off promising and takes a weird, unnecessary, disgusting turn for the worse the entire second half.
",2020-12-11 00:00:00,2,"I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, aside from the initial beauty and appeal of both leading women in the beginning. As soon as the movie begins its dramatic build, all character development and stability goes right out the window. It becomes a jumbled mess of poor execution and unnecessary, digusting and eve
triggersomee shock-value. The sole reason I continued to watch was because I had already made it halfway through. I'm quite disappointed in the actors and writers of this movie and urge you not to waste your time."
" Worst film
",2020-12-11 00:00:00,1,"Worst film i have ever seen, don't waste your time."
" Meh
",2020-12-11 00:00:00,3,"Premise, good. Execution, very bad. Stick to action movies, Keanu."
" Interesting Yet Different...
",2020-12-10 00:00:00,7,"Did not expect to see Keanu Reeves in a role as such that he is being ""portrayed"" as before light sheds through. It's an alright movie to sit back with your significant other and watch, but expect lots of adult themes and talk, so it is not one to watch when the kids are awake or in the room."
" No one would turn down free pizza
",2020-12-08 00:00:00,6,"Evan is a great guy, with a lovely family (a puppy included), a beautiful house and a job that he loves. His wife and kids go on a weekend vacation without him and in the first night alone two girls knock on his door, pretending to be lost. He offers to help them by calling an Uber and drying their clothes (it was raining outside). After a little bit of awkwardness, they start to chat and of course the conversation becomes more and more sexual and tension starts to build in and Evan becomes more and more uncomfortable with them. When the Uber arrives the girls decide to take a shower and when Evan desperately tries to take them out of the bathroom they seduce him. They have a threesome and in the next morning the girls are not so funny anymore: their personalities are erratic and even a bit dangerous. After arguing, he takes them home and go back to his house to clean up the mess. But at night they come back wanting revenge because he betrayed his family by sleeping with them (!).
About the movie: the acting was horrible, specially from the actors pretending to be Keanu's family. The wife and kids awful...and even Keanu seemed a little off as a loving parent. The two girls (Lorenza and Ana) were not so bad, the problem is that they had no back story and no point for being doing all of they did. I took that they were abuse victims, specially Ana's character, after that scene where she ""rapes"" Keanu because she starts calling him daddy and asking why did he did all that to her. They were mentally unstable that's for sure. The greatest scene is the one Keanu gives his great speech, justifying why he couldn't have said no to them, by saying that what they had offered him was like free pizza and nobody refuses free pizza (sometimes we must). The movie is over the top, it's nonsense, sometimes it's funny, the audience don't get their revenge (happens often in life), an innocent man dies and the motivation of the girls, to punish married man that don't respect their families gets lost in all of this. It's not that bad if you don't expect anything good from it. It's free pizza..."
" It Gives A Little But It Is A Tease
",2020-12-08 00:00:00,6,"This is a well-acted and well-designed film.
It is satisfying because the movie addresses multiple fantasies like having a menage a trois, being with a nubile schoolgirl and of course cheating and scoring babes.
Yet, as much as the audience is treated to a little skin ultimately there is no sex scene. Disappointment ensues.
It does have an interesting ending since the man of the house is certainly off the hook, which is fair enough since he resisted the episode to begin with."
" Trash
",2020-12-06 00:00:00,1,"Garbage! Never leave reviews but this has to be one of the worst movies I've ever watched, on any budget."
" Finally Something Different!
",2020-12-05 00:00:00,8,"I don't understand the hate and low reviews, other than this was maybe before it's time. In a world with so many remakes, finally something fresh and different. I admit, it took about 20 mins to really get me into the movie, (it was hard to not see this as John Wick's new family), but this movie picked up the pace and delivered. It was cringey, intelligent, suspenseful. And it sent the message ""free pizza"" ain't always free. We were all still talking about it the next day. Yeah the acting suffered a little without Keanu, but overall it was a really great and clever thriller!"
