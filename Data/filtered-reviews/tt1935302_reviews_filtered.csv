" A modern heart of darkness
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,9,"If you haven't read it or understood it you will not really understand this. The Heart of Darkness is about the gradual loss of comprehension and understanding of the reality in which we live. In the original it was about a trip up a river in which sanity is gradually lost. In Apocalypse Now it is about the insanity of war. In this movie it is about the insane consequences of living in broken communities and loss of connection to the real world. Some parts of this are painful to watch. It drags on in some places. We never know what the aliens are doing to the world. We just dream of coming back to something that we can believe in, but we live in a world in which sanity becomes harder to find. It takes a while to figure this out. Persevere."
" Terrible at best
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,3,"The movie seemed as if it were going to go somewhere and offer a point, but it failed in doing so and gave no conclusion. The acting wasn't bad at all, but the writing was clearly perpetrated by someone without the semblance of skill. If there were some deeper meaning to why there was no direction, point, or conclusion, it's clearly an inside joke between only a few. I suppose one *could* make assumptions about what was being said, if anything at all to the obvious of mankind is its own problem, but the movie was just so badly written it's hard to even entertain possibilities in meaning. Much harder to entertain than the actors who did their very best with a lousy script."
" Coulda, shoulda, woulda
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,3,"This could have been a good war movie. Better plot, better character development, no monsters. It just lacked so much direction. I wanted to like it, and the acting of the main characters and the gritty action scenes say I should have, but there was so many other problems I just had too many distractions to what might have been good"
" Monsters: * where are the monsters *
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,3,"So let's get the obvious out of the way... the monsters are a very small piece of the film and basically a sideshow. The main part of the film is U.S. Soldiers vs Taliban(?), and emphasizes the emotional aspect war has on people. Acting is subpar, and I don't even think they had a decent military advisor to tell them how effed up their plot and dialogue was. I've heard better military scripts in video games. Surprisingly, the CGI for the monsters/aliens was really good. And there were a lot of ways to take this movie in a different direction. For example, even in the movie one of the lines is basically ""we are going over there to fight the insurgents, and occasionally monsters if we need to"". You would think that if aliens were really a menace destroying them would be priority one for all mankind, and fighting an insurgency far down on the list.In a nutshell, it is marketed as a Monsters movie, but isn't. So keep that in mind."
" Bad, just awful bad
",2020-12-15 00:00:00,2,"Great premise and idea for a film, but great ideas don't make for great films and this was a real stinking pile. The intro was likely the best part of the film."
" extremely boring
",2020-11-11 00:00:00,3,"What was I actually watching here? (some war drama or pff... i dont know for shoure) Which was actually supposed to be the point of this movie, what is actually the theme guide. Either way, it's not worth your time especially if you're a fan of science fiction. The previous movie was relatively interesting but this second part is a total failure, it's incredibly boring to watch this movie"
" Waste of time.
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,1,Monster is in the title but I'm not sure why. It's a war movie... and not a good one. Occasionally there's a monster for some reason but it doesn't add anything to the actual story. Very slow. Very boring. No real plot.
" Just awful
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,1,"As a fan of the first movie I was excited to see the sequel. My excitement was destroyed immediately. This movie is overly pretentious and up its own but with metaphors and brooding dialog. The characters are more unlikable than a group Camp Crystal Lake counselors. The first thing our ""heroes"" do is go to a dog fight and watch the dog gets brutally killed. Don't waste your time with wildly awful movie."
" 2 reasons to watch, trigger finger on Fast Forward
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,6,"Yes it's just a war movie shot by someone without clear plot idea (I will bet there was a committee telling Green what to do. I will bet lunch).
BUT! The monsters are spectacular. Utterly beautiful. Watch it for no other reason and it's still better than most drivel.2 scenes stand out, do not miss one second. They both ring with poignant truth to stay with you later. 1. When Sophia Boutella and an army guy sit in a circle of lamps and watch the desert sky. I wont spoil it by saying more. Just watch carefully whenever Boutella is onscreen.
2. A little boy has a pretty tin box for his ""treasures"" as all children do the world over. Army guy and boy dont speak the same language but this is a magical moment. Again, I wont spoil it by saying more.I fast forwarded through some of the movie, I didn't understand the attempts at pathos but these two moments stick out for me.Dont miss any monster scenes. Really really good effects. Lucas eat ya heart out."
" Why the Hate?
",2020-07-21 00:00:00,7,"I can't figure out why this movie's so despised. People write about the contrast between gangsta tough then crying like babies have clearly never lived either life.
This wasn't a great movie but I was surprised at how well the effects were executed, the fighting was suspenseful and as for the lack of monsters? There were more than the first movie and they improved significantly on the representation. From infant to massive adult , the viewer got the full scope of interaction.
I liked it. Like a blend of Cloverfield and (insert fun war movie title). Not as good as Saving Private Ryan but certainly on par with Kilo 2 Bravo ~ and I think better than Jarhead. Way more action than both and good special effects."
" If you liked the original...
",2020-07-12 00:00:00,8,"...you'll enjoy this iteration too. No, it's not a ""monster"" movie, but neither was the prequel. And, in fact, neither are most monster movies. It's a movie about the human condition, and the true monsters are, well, you'll have to watch for yourself and then you can decide. If you want thought provoking, give it a whirl."
" Fears of Warfare
",2020-07-09 00:00:00,7,"Set aside the wierd alien monsters, this is a warfare flick with punishing fatal warfare and its survivors."
" A different monster film
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,9,"This feels like a crazy mashup of a boring afternoon news channel mixed with a monsters invasion buildup on a strange sunny day.Saw this on Netflix, very few movies get so creative on the 3D work with such type of creatures. If you are a war movie fan and a monster movie buff, nothing gets better then this movie. One of the best genre cocktails ever made. But if you are looking for good storytelling, this is definitely not the movie for you."
" False advertising bordering on a complete lie
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,5,"It's necessary to mark this review as containing spoilers yet I don't think I am in effect spoiling anything. Instead I am calling shenanigans on a movie that is almost completely predicated on a compete lie, from the synopsis down to the very first word of the title.
What this is, in essence, is a war story, replete with all the tropes of a modern war story set in the middle east, with a brief Saving Private Ryan-type subplot about a mission to rescue some soldiers and bringing them home that goes horribly wrong. PTSD and inner reflecting abounds among the survivors, one of which loses all his boyhood friends in the mission who came with him.
But that's not what the movie is sold as. The IMDB synopsis is one sentence long and amounts to ""Monsters' reign continues to spread on Earth"". The Netflix synopsis is ""An American platoon stationed in the Middle East is thrust into battle with a breed of tentacled aliens whose rapid spread threatens human survival.""
Virtually every part of that is a lie except for the first 11 words.
The alien monsters show up quickly and are very impressive looking. It's also very quickly established that they are almost a non-entity. US air forces routinely bomb the giant walking monsters while infantry get deployed to do routine ""kill some insurgents"" missions. Monsters occasionally plod around their battlefield and only get involved to try to eat someone and get repelled with some minor gunfire.
The alien monsters are not sentient, and it's never explained how or why they came to Earth. I have no problem at all with not explaining such things, but when so little of the film is actually dedicated to them, their lack of even a token origin story (maybe they were floating around in space before they fell to Earth) becomes at best, a missed opportunity and at worst, a distraction from an otherwise competently told non-sci-fi story.
We are told that these Monsters spread some kind of spore, but at no point is this considered a threat in any way. No one wears any sort of biohazard protection or make any sort of ""decontamination"" attempt on affected areas. The Zergling-type monsters even casually romp around in the desert, free as horses, not doing anything or attacking anyone. The soldiers take potshots at them and move on.
I don't know what the intent of this sort of deception was, but given how obscure the film is, clearly it didn't help. The amount of money and effort put into rendering the CG monsters is effectively wasted, as the Monsters contribute absolutely nothing to the story, even as a background story unfolding in the background.Completely removing anything remotely related to the alien Monsters would not have affected this film's story in any way."
" This movie makes zero sense.
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,2,Just a terrible mish-mash of a movie that does not make any sense. The whole thing could have not even included aliens in it at all. Completely unnecessary...
" Just Bad
",2020-03-01 00:00:00,2,Nothing really about Monsters. Mostly a bunch of crying soldiers with extreme close up camera work.Don't waste your time.
" Mumblers: Dank Tommyrot or just Pure 💩!
",2020-02-15 00:00:00,1,"Plain and Simple, this movie Sucks! The so-called ""Monsters"" are in it less than 6 or 7 minutes. It's basically a politically correct war movie that takes place in the Middle East. It's impossible to care for the central characters because they are so unlikeable. And what little action that does take place has so many lulls in it you'll catch yourself going to sleep every few minutes! This is nothing like the first movie at all! Watch only if you're trying to go to bed."
" Monsters ate 2 hours of life
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,2,"Ultimately a waste of time. The movie starts with a young man stating that he never wanted to be a soldier and then the film spends a significant amount of time building back story of a group of guys from Detroit.
Continuing as a story of these men in the Army going to a conflict in the mid East, the plot gets lost as disjointed screen writing mixed with better than adequate monster special effects carry viewers toward an ending that is far from satisfactory.
There is no conflict resolution. There is no explanation of the intermittent appearance of the alien monsters or why they have a place in the movie's title. Narratives require bringing loose ends together in the end. This film, not knowing what it was supposed to accomplish, just stops. The good news is that it stopped."
" Beyond bad. Spoiler alert
",2020-01-31 00:00:00,2,"Bad acting, bad script, boys playing soldiers. So many questions... Why didn't the two survivors combine the gas to one motorcycle and ride tandem? What was a school bus doing in the middle of the desert? Why did the new daddy feel like he really had to go out with the boys on the night of his baby's birth when he would be seeing the same dudes on a tour? How did these guys ever become soldiers in the first place? What did the sniper do wrong to go from sniping to leading a crew into the desert? Was there another reason the insurgents declared war on the Americans besides saving their arses from the creatures? (Their were civilian casualties, but unfortunately that's gonna happen when bombs are dropped.)2 stars for the actors having to deal with Jordanian heat."
" Profoundly disappointing
",2020-01-29 00:00:00,2,"Let's start with the positives: acting was great, cinematography was great, so kudos to the cast, camera crews, special effects and creature effects teams. The plot was non-existent, the pace was oppressively slow, the script was confusing."
" Do not read the negative reviews they did not see the movie, TROLLS!
",2020-01-29 00:00:00,10,"I am a military combat vet! WHen I started watching this I thought this was going to be another B rated movie and boy I was wrong, I avoid military movies because I tense up and blank out and that is what exactly happen from the realism in this movie! Right now its on Netflix and My lower Back L$ and L% are completely inflamed like a softball, This never happens unless I go through a PTSD episode, these reviewers are complete trolls with negative comments like they are spoiled children that should keep there mouth shut and their opinions to themselves.I can not believe that the comedian/actor Tom Green directed this, obviously he missed his calling earlier in life but it is never too late to direct and this movie was very detailed, a very good psychotic adventure of the life of a new recruit going to war not knowing what to expect, I bet you non of these negative reviews ever went to war if they did those reviews would be a 10!Jay Basu was the writer and he is new at writing, I am impressed by his screenwriting and expect to see more of his professional work in the scifi war anthology arena.So many good actors here, Joe Dempsie with his emotional transition from the hood to the world beyond the hood, God! the war zone makes the hood look like Park Ave. amazing performance, Johnny Harris, Kyle Soller, Sam Keeley, Nicholas Pinnock, Michaela Coel, Michaela played the hood type wife of Parker Sawyers which both together was amazing to see. This story is riveting and will take you on that emotional love hate roller coaster and makes you question why are we there in the first place?SOFIA BOUTELLA, Not many people get recognized because they play this background short roll but she was the muslim women on horseback that carried the dying child from the School bus, this was a refreshing scene past the war part that helped to ease my anxiety but I had my service dog next to me to help me through it as well.I honestly do not know how people can gives this a negative review, I bet you they never seen it and all they saw was the trailer just to get credit in making a review, Shame on you lazy millennials that do not care about the public! If your going to give a lazy review and lie just leave this to the professionals like myself! I too am a TV and Movie background actor and theater Producer.Give this movie a try and get ready to go through that emotional coaster it is part of the ride!."
" Why...
",2020-01-28 00:00:00,1,"Would someone even make this? The first one was quite entertaining. This one is a joke. If you're after a creature feature, this will be very unsatisfying. If you're after a movie that wants to win the worst movie of the year award, this would be a good candidate."
" Not a bad movie as suggested
",2020-01-27 00:00:00,7,I think it was a pretty good movie. The main problem was not delving into the creature or Monster part of it. I think there was a message there almost like it is not stoppable. The battle part was half and half correct.I was bored in the first 20 mins I think that was poorly done but got better after the road side bombing. They tried to hard to create US soldering in battle. You can't. Best example of it may be Generation Kill.Anyway if more information on the monsters would have been done instead of trying to be vague and mysterious would have been better. Still once it got into the meat of the story about 40 mins in it was good and interesting.
" Decent war movie
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,7,"Really don't get the bad reviews. This is a decent movie. It's not very Sci-fi, the monsters are more of a back drop, but still a really enjoyable, exciting movie.
The scores of 5 and below are just inaccurate and only posted by those who were expecting more alien interaction I guess."
" AWFUL
",2020-01-18 00:00:00,1,"Let's pretend this sequel was never done. Awul, pointless, useless, senseless and tedious for all the length. Direction, acting and more was more like a 10$ self-made movie."
" What a load of s#1t
",2020-01-18 00:00:00,1,"Terrible sequal to one the best movies I've ever seen, the first one has chemistry while this one has chemicals being snorted up their noses, the first one had romance while this one had banging prostitutes in a crack house, it never should of been made"
" A Good Movie!
",2020-01-18 00:00:00,4,"I've read the critics and users reviews. The Monsters are not relevant? Oh Sir, you missed it all. Bad actors? Oh Maam, you did not see. One of the best movies I have seen since ""Moon""."
" Woeful Trash
",2020-01-17 00:00:00,2,What A disappointing gutless piece of trash. Skip this garbage.
" What did I just watch?
",2020-01-17 00:00:00,1,"Umm... Never seen the first one. Didn't know there was a first one. After watching this I will not watch the first one. I thought it would be cool to watch because it was presented as a military vs aliens movie and saw that Tom Green was the director. Wrong Tom Green apparently. I would love to spoil it for you... But I don't know what the hell to even say. Was it a war movie, or a sci-fi movie. The only redeeming possibility would be if the monsters tired back to the Cloverfield franchise... But unfortunately it did not."
" Thanks, Fellow Reviewers, For Saving 60 Minutes of My Life
",2020-01-17 00:00:00,1,"You've probably been there before.
Start a movie... enough modest hopes to pay attention at the beginning. Those few typical hints at a promising tale allow it to continue (despite the increasing numbers of SKIPS!) Then other distractions--ANY distractions--lure you away. Hour or two later you realize this movie's been playing in the background the whole time and has become a forgettable disappointment. Da heck am I watching? See other reviews.
And next time, I'll at least glance at the general reviews. Thanks all Out There for saving at least an hour of my life wasted."
" Confusing afffffff
",2020-01-15 00:00:00,1,"Watching this was like being forced to listen to someone tell a story and you just don't care. Confusing with scene transitions and a complete lack of exposition being shown half way decent cgi without any explanation on what's being shown while scenes are overly dark or saturated without lighting. Again there is basically no explanation on what these things are where they come from or how they ended up here.
This leaves me wondering if any of this was covered in the first movie"
" Slow then Very Slow
",2020-01-15 00:00:00,3,"This movie could have been so good if you only they focused on the Monsters rather than the local Jihad. I guess the movie was trying to teach us Terrorist and Alians are good... They just need a hug...
Boy was this movie slow and boring..."
" Less a monster movie than a modern war film.
",2020-01-15 00:00:00,5,"There are some decent reviews here that need no additives, so I'll leave a simple comment re: content.The monsters take up barely 10% of the film. I really enjoyed the first one, and even that had limited monster screen time, but aside from there being a few monsters in this movie, it is nothing but a modern war movie with dramatic character scenery.It's a well made film for what it is, it's just not a monster flick. If that's what you're looking for, and haven't seen the first film, I wouldn't recommend it. If you're merely a fan of dramatic war films that illustrate what war does to the human psyche, then sure...give it a watch."
" Monsters?
",2020-01-14 00:00:00,2,"Rather pointless. The 'monsters' aren't much as nasty aliens. Have no great expectations, aside from plenty of firepower, and you'll be okay for an intellectual zone out."
" the monstrosity present in our species
",2020-01-12 00:00:00,7,It is a work of art created to allow us to see once again the monstrosity that is present in our species.
" Great Start, Bad Ending
",2019-12-19 00:00:00,4,"I'll be brief. Great start to the movie. I liked where it was going and the action and character build was good. The second half was completely different. The tone was a complete 180. The film tried way too hard to be symbolic and artsy. The monsters where just a side plot. Not a bad movie, just a wasted opportunity of a blossoming franchise in my opinion. It's one of those movies that's worth your time when you have spare time."
" There IS something beautiful here...
",2019-11-16 00:00:00,5,"Why do they insist on calling this series 'Monsters' if monsters are not the focus of the film? 'Monsters: Dark Continent' deviates from the monster element to incorporate a local war. The monsters were merely in the background. They also unnecessarily complicated the script. There's also way too much swearing.Why they decided to include the animal cruelty scenes is beyond me. I HATED that! I also hated the cliched soldier introductions and the stereotyped characters. This film is completely different to the original. My opinions regarding the movie are heavily divided. Part of me dislikes the film with passion for the cliched war story. Part of me absolutely loves the film for its shear beauty. I mean, some scenes look truly amazing on screen with great visuals - quite breathtaking, actually. Some scenes were so incredibly beautiful that I watched them over and over. The film also has a lot of emotional depth.The film is too slow paced for a war film. It is not a monster film. It is not entirely a fantasy film. It contains dramatic elements in abundance, yet it is not entirely a drama. Ultimately, I think the film combines too many genres and it doesn't gel properly. Yet, there's just something beautiful about this film. I commend the acting, visuals, photography and editing, which are all excellent. Maybe the 'monster' element should rather be interpreted figuratively instead of literally. It certainly would make a lot more sense."
" Nothing like the first film but...
",2019-08-26 00:00:00,8,"I was really in 2 minds whether to watch this film due to the wildly differing reviews, but I am glad I did.I enjoyed the first Monsters film, and although this is a world away from the style and feel of that film, I enjoyed the sequel on its own merits.I found it incredibly tense at times, and I did engage and empathise with the characters, flawed though many of them were.This is much more of a war film than a sci fi film, granted, but I felt it was well executed with some genuinely moving moments. The performances were strong and believable and I really don't get the terrible reviews."
" It's Not Sharknado - And Thank God For That!
",2019-08-25 00:00:00,10,"I was completely astonished when I saw the negative reviews for this movie, and decided to give it a 10 to redress the balance a bit.I found it captivating from the start, a sense of being there and being a part of the character's experience.I also thought that it was a showcase in PTSD, and extremely well portrayed.The monsters are mesmerizing in all their varied forms, there is a story here that is fascinating, a cinematic universe that could create many, many movies.I guess if you're expecting Sharknado, or It came from the desert, you would be dreadfully disappointed.But if you like an unusual, intelligent film and some serious visual story telling, perhaps you'll like this too."
" Are you serious
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,1,"If you're like me and came here based off the first movie, DO NOT BOTHER. Considering how the first movie just ENDS, I was so ready and excited to drop money on the second. It's just a poor excuse supposedly saying it has a connection by dropping some related words here and there."
" I really like this movie
",2019-07-22 00:00:00,10,"The whole point of this movie is that we are the monsters. That humans are not deserving of the planet and so therefore, are going to lose it. Sure, it's a bit like Hurt Locker meets Cloverfield but it has a message and there are no boring moments from start to finish."
" my notes
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,1,Awful. Didn't finish it. Again had almost nothing to do with monsters. More about war with the middle east . And it contradicted the original movie's basic storyline (1 viewing)
" Monsters Dark Continent monstrously destroys the thematic intelligence of its predecessor.
",2019-06-23 00:00:00,3,"Edwards' surprise debut 'Monsters' was a feature that, despite my reserved rating, had layers upon layers of contemporary purpose. The resemblance between extraterrestrial creatures and humanity was intricately explored through subtle visual flair. Well, much like any generic war film covering modern warfare, this sequel obliterated all thematic strands with its absence of monsters. A squad of soldiers head out to the Middle East to join the fight against insurgents and colossal creatures.Might as well call this ""Dark Continent"", to which you could just rename to ""Middle East The Movie 27"", as there are a total of four minutes of footage that includes the eponymous monsters. For a sequel that continues the commentary on humanity's social and aggressive behaviour, withdrawing the plot device that accentuates this theme (i.e the monsters) was the worst idea possible. In fact, take away the minimal footage of these alien fauna and you would still have the exact same film. That's how little impact they made to the narrative. What a waste! Never mind the one-dimensional soldiers that have as much charisma as a defunct IED explosive. You can even put aside the amateurish handheld directing technique in an attempt to retain the warfare's gripping and ferocious environment.Its main problem is just how frickin' boring the film is. Longest. Two. Hours. Ever. Its generic approach, in an already saturated genre, makes it utterly forgettable. A first hour of ""lads"" discussing ""laddish"" behavioural tropes whilst decimating their girlfriends/hookers on sofas and drawers. ""Make love not war, baby?"". Urgh, gimme a break! A second act that I cannot remember for the life of me. And a third act that was semi-decent, thanks to some gorgeous cinematography and an endearing score. The spore scene and final gargantuan were exemplary sequences that proved a sequel is possible, and desired. Just not this one that is equipped with every tired war cliché from the textbook. Bigger budget? Bigger letdown."
" Awful movie .. Don't Watch
",2019-05-24 00:00:00,2,"I didn't like the first Monsters movie really so don't know why so watched this one. One of the big issues is that I believe in most movies you need a hero to root for whether horror, action, comedy or thriller. There was nobody that likeable. All the four new recruits were assholes who like to go out on a Saturday night, have drug fuelled orgies and watch dog fights...nice. Yep, I wanted them all to die. The Aliens were lame. They are not in it enough and this is really a war movie rather than a science fiction or horror movie. It is basically saying that man is the real monster here, doing outrageously bad things to his fellow man. The Aliens don't seem to attack much, do they actually want to cause harm? The Aliens are really a metaphor for those foreign nations that are perceived to be a threat but in reality may not be. It was noisy, chaotic, boring and there was little much to like about it. My lowest grading on IMDB is a 2 and I did have to think long and hard to see whether I would go lower. I stuck with a two but am questioning why. Just swerve it"
" KNOW YOUR ENEMY
",2019-05-20 00:00:00,6,"This didn't seem to be much of a sequel. Instead of the Monsters living in a strict zone in Mexico they are now in the Middle East. A group of young men from Detroit join up to fight the Monsters with scenes that only briefly reminded me of ""Starship Troopers."" They join up with Sgt Frater (Johnny Harris) who is a slightly psychopathic ""American Sniper,"" I believe by design. Our crew is a bit disillusioned as they are tasked to kill insurgents in the local human population, people who don't like Americans because they were collateral damage in the monster killing.What this film made me realized, something I missed in the first film, is that the ""monsters"" are symbolic of what scares us as Americans...sort of like the bad guy in WWF. In the first film the Monsters came illegally across the border, and in this film they are in the Middle East mixed in with terrorists. In spite of now understanding the symbolism, it didn't help the film or the message which I didn't get assuming there was one other than ""know your enemy.""Personally I thought this was a good opportunity to use drones against the huge Monster targets, instead of boots on the ground. I don't think it would have made the film any more lame.Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity."
" Curious rocket
",2019-03-28 00:00:00,5,"A bleak future told in two distinct voices. The first half struggles against its own bulk as a soldier-move narrative, but acurious second half effortlessly lifts the film into a more metaphysical realm that rewards the persistent."
" Sh#te

" Shakycam Unwatchable rubbish.
",2018-11-30 00:00:00,1,You will feel sick / dizzy trying to watch the constant jerky camera movements. Don't bother. Waste of time. Rubbish.
" Can't understand the negativity.
",2018-11-03 00:00:00,8,"Excellent sequel to 'monsters'. Cross-pollinates the action, war and sci-fi genres, with very successful results. A serious take on 'starship troopers'! I found it worthy on all levels and deserves some attention."
" Dreadful
",2018-10-14 00:00:00,3,"A war movie with added monsters, with almost nothing to link the two. Most of the characters are unlikable and as they head off on a Saving Private Ryan mission, it's difficult to care whether any of them survive. Best avoided."
" What an ugly, pointless use of cameras!
",2018-08-31 00:00:00,1,Just incoherent story telling with themes that seem to border on ludicrous fascism with added pointlessness. Why the heck are there alien horse creatures? I totally lost an hour & more of my life wondering what that crap was. If you're thinking of watching it think of the good stuff you could watch & do that instead
" Bit, we are the monsters kinda thing...
",2018-07-20 00:00:00,5,"Seemed to be a lot of, ""Amarica kill the terrorising aliens, the aliens didn't deserve it, but when America does kill the Terororising aliens, the terrorising aliens exponentially grow in number and ferocity.""
One scene showed a girl who sympathised with the terrorising alien, having empathy for the little scratch the American had on his head. It felt a bit like she was saying ""I know possum u have a boo boo, you poor pettle. Now let me go spend my caring on the TERRORISing aliens... poor buggers get all this emotional grief just from lumbering about like a peaceful land whale!!"""
" This is not really a sci-fi/horror movie, this is a war movie
",2018-05-19 00:00:00,1,"As a war movie, this could be rated much higher, but it pretends to be sci-fi/horror movie. It is not. It is a war movie with many human monsters, a few special effect monsters thrown in to pretend it is sci-fi/horror and unlikable characters (at least for me). If you want a movie about a group of young men going to war and how they react to the horrors of it, I am sure you can find other, much better movies that don't pretend to be something other than they are."
" The worst movie I've ever seen
",2018-05-07 00:00:00,1,"In all my years of watching movies, this is certainly the worst. It's like the writers just lost interest half way through it. 2 hours of my life I'll never get back!"
" Yes, the acting wasn't best, however.......
",2018-04-21 00:00:00,5,"I watched this movie expecting monsters galore and soldiers all up in arms trying to stop them. 
However the movie really isn't about that, it's about loss and the feeling of really losing soldiers you were entrusted to protect as a leader.
The ""monsters"" seem to be the humans in this movie and the actual ""monsters"" are just innocent creatures moving across the landscape which poses the question as to are we the monsters?"
" Not many Monsters, more of a war movie
",2018-04-05 00:00:00,6,"Following on from the enjoyable comes the sequel, Dark Continent. 
This film follows American soldiers on a search and rescue mission in the Middle East, though the actual place is never revealed. What lets this film down is that there really is a lack of the Monsters here. The bulk of the action is war related, and to be fair it does that pretty well. I guess the point being that Man is the real monster. Plenty of violence on show, plus some nudity. Quite strong for a BBFC 15 certificate. Another thing that I felt let down about - it's a British movie with a mainly British cast, so why the need for it to be seen as ""American""? Dollars, no doubt! But overall a pretty solid effort."
" A film that makes you think.
",2018-02-12 00:00:00,7,"If you're looking for a movie that's about killing aliens, big explosions and mindless violence, this is not the film for you. I initially thought it might be just a standard action film, but I was pleasantly surprised as I realized that would not be the case. Monsters: Dark Continent is a film that explores various themes, from human relationships, to war and violence. The violence is not the key attraction here. If anything, it makes you realize how pointless violence is and how it just breeds more violence and hatred. The monsters are presented in a way that might lead a viewer to realize that they may not be the villains they are described to be. In one scene, a herd of monsters are running alongside the Humvees when one runs in front of the Humvee and gets killed. We see a monster running towards the corpse in the distance and there is a brief moment where we see the monster standing by its dead companion, almost as if it's mourning. At this moment, I realized that maybe the monsters weren't meant to be villains and that maybe they were not the malicious creatures we were lead to believe they were. This is a fantastic film that has many layers in it."
" Waste of time.
",2018-01-17 00:00:00,3,"Title.
The movie doesn't make sense within it's own world that it created.
I love mindfuck movies, horror movies, sci-fi, mysteries all of that good stuff and this movie was a poor excuse when it comes to any of those genres. 
TWO whole hours of my life wasted.
Thank you Tom Green !One of a few movies where i'm agreeing with the ratings that imbd gave."
" Like all good sci-fi, it's not about the aliens.
",2018-01-10 00:00:00,8,"I'm baffled where there are so many reviews. I think it's more to do with expectation than of the movie itself. I haven't seen the first Monsters and saw this sequel as a standalone. In all honesty this is a brilliant movie, and here's the reason why:This is a movie about human nature - not aliens. It's about the extremes of people when faced with hopelessness. Whether you take the monsters as literal (ie. there's a fight against aliens in the middle east) or as a metaphor for an unsurmountable and 'alien' enemy fighters, the movie highlights: 1. the sacrifice of ones own identity, sanity, family and meaning. and 2. the senseless waste of 'collateral damage' for the greater good for a war that cannot be won.This realisation occurs to soldier as he watches the alien spores after the child dies, and the image of the commander losing his mind as the unstoppable mountain of aliens rise from the sand.The purpose of the aliens is not to create an alien or sci-fi movie. The aliens could just have well been replaced by a deadly virus, killer asteroid, or zombies. It's a story of human apocalypse, and madness of some types of human behaviour when illuminated by this context."
" the real monster is not the monsters
",2017-09-18 00:00:00,10,"This is one of the most underrated movie ever. This movie is very significant because it shows that people without AN EXISTENTIAL MEANING search for a MISSION where to get it beyond the futility of its daily life by a gun and uniform so to cause and get only DEATH. There is action, meaning and reality in this movie, brutal reality where INNOCENCE is defeated by the hypocrisy of a war fought against the monsters inside the soul of wasted people deceived as well as disillusioned because of the void inside their souls due to a false material life. The soldiers will search for the mission to get a meaning, but they will get the REALITY of their useless life, useless weapons, useless uniform and useless deaths surrounded by the genuineness of life around themselves which they begin to consider as the enemy, so discovering that... the real MONSTER IS THE ""puppet"" WITH THE GUN (they are the real enemies which manages the gun in order to feel big because they stay small). This movie is too much smart for many people unable to understand and appreciate its meaning."
" Surreal, Dreamlike, Beautiful and Tragic
",2017-08-19 00:00:00,9,"Another one of those movies shown as part of Film4's 'Creature Feature' that I would probably never have rented. Having missed the first 5 minutes though I will now definitely get this on Blu Ray, to own.One thing I've come to learn though is that the ratings on IMDb are now pretty useless as any sort of guide as to whether a movie is worth watching or not. 4.3? Seriously?? What a joke! I'm a huge fan of Starship Troopers but for me movies like Monsters: Dark Continent is what science fiction is really all about. No grandstanding, no witty quotable one-liners, no A-list actors, and no endless streams of explosions or action in a desperate attempt to keep the mass of ADD watchers from getting distracted.Most importantly it explores the human condition against a futuristic imaginary backdrop. I'd describe Monsters: Dark Continent as enjoyably hypnotic providing of course that you allow yourself to enjoy it."
" Well this is better then the first one.
",2017-08-19 00:00:00,4,This is a sequel to a movie called Monsters. This is not a god movie. But it is not has bad has monsters. This does have a very good story line. It has an awful acting. It is boring and slow at times. Do not wast your time. Do not waste your money. This movie is pooh. Who are these people who keep giving it 5. It is not a 5. It is a 4. Do not see this movie. It a horror movie that is not scary. It is a lot of pooh pooh. Do not see it. See Godzilla. See King Kong (1933). Do not see this movie. See Kong skull island. Do not see this. This will put you to sleep.
" We are the Monsters
",2017-08-18 00:00:00,8,"If the first one was a road movie then this one was just as surprising flipping, what should have been a shoot 'em up sequel, into a thoughtful examination of military imperialism and the psychological pressures of combat. This was in the vein of The Hurt Locker or Jarhead showing soldiers on the edge of nervous and physical exhaustion pitted not only against extra-terrestrial monsters but an indigenous population whose death and mutilation is deemed to be acceptable to combat the alien threat. The reality is that the monsters are just a metaphor for a nameless faceless enemy and, by depicting the flesh, blood and emotions of the Arab people, we're left to wriggle uncomfortably at the sights and sounds of what collateral damage really looks like. Some of the photography is breathtaking, first the urban desolation of bankrupt Detroit, then the wild spaces of the nameless Arab state where the monsters are thriving and finally to the close ups of the faces and especially the eyes of the soldiers. The shots of the remaining two on motorbikes in the desert and the huge creatures against a distant sunset are reminiscent of Easy Rider or Lawrence of Arabia. The performances are equally strong. Johnny Harris as Frater and Sam Keeley as Parkes are excellent; both spiralling downwards with the horrors they're witnessing and participating in but still vainly trying to do their job. There's a particularly moving scene where the two are rescued and then fed by a Bedouin tribe whist in the background the casualties from a bombed school bus are washed, shrouded and buried. The reality of precision bombing."
" disappointing
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,3,"It's 10 years after Monsters. In the Middle East, the US military struggles to fight both the monsters and insurgents. Staff Sgt Frater has served 17 years. In Detroit, best friends Michael Parkes, Frankie Maguire, Karl Inkelaar, and new father Sean Williams head off as green soldiers.I don't know how much Gareth Edwards has to do with this production. I don't know if he could help as the director. It's not strictly the director's fault. It's more about the writing. It's a bunch of characters that I don't know and don't care about. The monsters are back but this is lifeless. One would think that the US military would draw back out of the Middle East to consolidate the homeland defense. After Monsters, a sequel should be about stemming the tide on American soil. The original was a happy surprise. This one is a disappointment but not necessarily a surprising one."
" A poor sequel to a poor movie
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,1,"If you've seen the first Monsters film you won't be disappointing, it's just as rubbish as that. Like in the first film things look good and acting isn't too offensive, but you still hardly see any monsters and it's still dull. Again this is a journey based movie rather than anything to do with horror, thrills, or monsters. I can only give this film a one star review which is less than the first film because it's not even original, more of a rehash of the first film. Same pretentious metaphors, taking itself too seriously with no lasting action or attachment to emotions. I'm glad I don't have to watch this again. Yawn."
" A terrible sequel; no wonder it bombed
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,2,"I should admit from the start that I was no fan of the original MONSTERS, which I found to be an arty bore. Sadly, this terrible sequel is even worse, a near-plot less affair that manages to convey a weird apocalyptic world populated by a giant alien race co-existing alongside mankind. However, much of this is mere subtext and instead DARK CONTINENT seems to be your typical men-on-a-mission war film.It's gritty and hand-held throughout, but suffers hugely from an excruciatingly lunk-headed script which is full of profanity and no wit. There's a lot of screaming, shouting, and crying, which all gets very tiresome very quickly. The CGI effects are used sparingly and are pretty good, but for me the writing is the thing and it's really poor here. It's a shame, as a couple of the main actors have been great elsewhere (Johnny Harris in THIS IS ENGLAND, Joe Dempsie in GAME OF THRONES) but they're really struggling here."
" Starship Troopers did it so much better
",2017-07-06 00:00:00,4,"What a totally bizarre movie. First off it's called ""Dark Continent"" but the action takes place in the Middle East, not Africa.The first third of the film is populated by irritating and unlikeable jar heads whose idea of a good night out is sex with prostitutes, drugs and animal cruelty in downtown Detroit.Next, we move these Einstein's on to the Middle East (where I, for one, couldn't really care if they live or die). Now we introduce some strange looking aliens, the largest of which are like huge lumbering giraffes with hydra heads, who make whale- like noises. There is apparently a smaller breed who run like cheetahs mainly, it seems, to lure the clueless Marines into IED's.Later we are introduced to the baby of the species, one of which lives in a kids toy box and pops out like something out of a Disney movie to sprinkle fairy dust onto the desert floor.Now add to the mix the main ""meat"" of the movie, a violent and visceral incursion by the American Marines into Taliban territory. Yes, this is basically a war movie with monsters thrown in (for goodness only knows what reason). This is not a metaphor, not a satire, certainly not art-house, in fact, I can't really say what it is at all. I just kept thinking how Starship Troopers addressed the issues of patriotism and war (with aliens) in such better context so many decades before.Not totally without merit as some of the scenes are quite haunting but this film desperately needed an editorial snip to cut at least a half hour off the run-time and a much firmer focus on intention. The acting is also pretty mediocre, but then, if the director was as confused about his vision as he seems to have been, you can't really blame the players.All in all a major mess that needed far more real monsters and far less of the ""real monster is man"" cliché."
" Good but completely misunderstood
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,7,"This film flips around the first one and starts asking who the real monsters are. Judging by the progressively worsening behaviour of the soldiers (on both sides), it's pretty clear who.If you are looking for a regular alien monster movie, this is not it. If you're looking for something a bit different, give it a go, it's certainly well made.Ignore the reviews complaining about the lack of the monsters on screen, we don't need to be spoon-fed (""this film is called monsters, here are some monsters"") all the time."
" Take it for what its worth. Don't be fooled with the title.
",2017-05-06 00:00:00,4,"My expectations went south in a hurry. Monsters take up mere moments of the screen time. The dark continent is now another name for Afghanistan. All the fast forwarding in the world will not make this movie what it is implied to be. But on the other hand, not totally worthless as a war movie.It has been about ten years since humongous tentacled creatures began trying to take over our planet. These monsters seem closer and closer to occupying the entire globe and the military is at its wits end trying to fight these horrid things off. In desperation, the military is lowering its standards for enlisting. Four young men from Detroit think they are hard and smart enough to help the army fight monsters.The writers, Tom Green and Jay Basu, sneak some monsters into the plot that has an American platoon trying to extract ambushed soldiers that are trapped in the alien infested Middle East. I am guessing the combination of the few monsters along with the vulgarity of guts, gore, violence, heartbreak and tribulations of warfare with the Taliban makes for a strong R rating. This movie lasts right at two hours and expect to leave tired. Maybe with more monsters and a bigger budget this could be a real thriller.Cast includes: Johnny Harris, Sam Keeley, Nicholas Pinnock, Jesse Nagy, Kyle Soller, Joe Dempsie and Uriel Emil."
" Grit
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,8,"Talking about Monsters: Dark Continent (2014) Directed b y Tom Green, who co wrote it with Jay Basu. I very much liked the original Monsters, and looked forward to seeing this entry. In many ways it is like the first film; Both put you in a close to the action by way of the characters. Both involve journeys into the Infected Zones, Both have a sequence of Awe at the fantastic beasts. There are many in this version. There is where the similarity ends, This is a soldiers point of view, and this is a war film. Given a tight group of street buddies, from Detroit, We are introduced to the guys, Johnny Harris, Sam Keeley, Joe Demise are the leads. We get their camaraderie in scenes that unfold much like in ""The Deer Hunter"" The actors here are all dead serious, and tough, As are the characters they play. The Mission is to keep the insurgents down while hunting the huge monsters. The scenario switches to the Middle East. Wonderful location shots abound. The look of the film turns to Ridley Scott's ""Blackhawk Down"". The sound work is awesome. What starts out for the soldiers, as a shooting gallery game, turns dead serious when they are fired upon. The subject of the Insuergents treads on thin Ice. Parallels can be drawn from the current world scene, and although I do not buy the argument that our military would bomb civilian areas, to inflict harm on the Monsters, the ""Oppressed people fighting back"" argument mirrors current events. At one point in the film, one of the leaders states that we are there to battle the insurgents first, then the Monsters. People killing people. The monster design is wonderful, the creatures seem to have evolved into many various forms, from a pit bull sized street beast, to a graceful horse like runner, who's heard sweep the dessert sands, running faster than jeeps. The huge beasts are wonderful constructs, with no recognizable features, but familiar in their movements. In truth the monsters are secondary elements. The high drama and fear and pain come from the battles with the insurgents. Madness and anger dominate and cloud reason. Innocents are killed. and therein lies the true tragedy here. The loss of friends. This is a thought provoking and intense film experience. Do not expect to have a good or easy time here. All the technical aspects were spot on. The dog barking off to the side sounded like it was in my room. Some epic, but understated long shots. I found this a sadly overlooked but well done movie. . Eight out of Ten Gritty Stars."
" Good Movie
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,6,"As mentioned by other folks. This movie isn't all bad.Following on from the excellent first movie they have done a great job in making a suggestive movie. What would you do in a combat situation with the over threat of alien monsters? And how it would affect you over time?Granted the human side is slightly overplayed and possibly overdone but it works well. The alien side is played down but again, threat unknown.Good movie, worth a watch."
" Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,1,"Yes, I'm talking about a sequel to an already crappy movie. Why watch the second installment if the first wasn't even remotely appealing? Well, my fault for being interested in more of the monster alien ""invasion"". Hopped they'd gotten their game together and pulled a better plot with more points to make about minimum sci-fi twist (where, when and how were they found, a paragraph about alien colonizing ecosystem, etc) as opposed to the multiple, yet undefined genre the first movie was aiming at. I wrote about the first to be uninspired and completely misdirected (somebody said even ""cheap"" and I think that replaces low budget), but this one is even worse. They tried so hard a repeat of the nonsense in the first they almost crapped themselves. The actors are screaming and making all sorts of noises as if they have some stomach issues and that's almost a spoiler. Worse actors than first installment? Check on negative scale, zero is too much. Sometimes, there are people who excel at something. The people involved in the making of these movies surely excel, but not in cinematography, this is where they suck. Get a DIFFERENT job!"
" Total trash
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,1,"I managed about 40 minutes of this film before I took it out of the DVD player and put it on Ebay. This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever sat down to watch, what made it even worse was the fact that there were monsters in it to try and prop up one awful story line in fact the story line in parts were almost the same as ""Hurt locker"". Special effects were good but that is about all that was any good with it. All in I never got to the end of the film as it was so bad what could have been a good story and survival war movie was lost in the plot of this film. So if there is anyone out there thinking they will sit down tonight with a good movie then forget it this will make you think again."
