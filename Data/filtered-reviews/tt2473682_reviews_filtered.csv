" I Was Surprised...... (In a good way)
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,7,"If you have watched the films prior you kind of got used to certain characters, but for this one, it took it in a new direction where they could literally expand it to anything near enough. It's a good film, just something was missing to give it that top mark."
" What the hell was I watching?
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,1,For the first 20 minutes or so I had really had no idea if I was even watching the right movie. A few tie ins to the first few movies but that was it. And to hear the F bomb dropped every 5th word made this movie very unenjoyable. You won't miss much by not watching this one

" Demons In The Hood!
",2020-12-28 00:00:00,5,"I've become a fan of the 'Paranormal Activity' franchise, (though sometimes I feel like I'm watching a
Bar Mitzvah video with monsters)But this one's my favorite...maybe because it takes place in the hood, so the dialogue in hipper, the characters are more relatable and there are some clever little gimmicks like the use of the 'Simon' game as a Ouija board...(Crackle)"
" Honestly a pleasant surprise
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,6,"I watched ""Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension"" prior to watching this, so I really didn't have high hopes for it after that turd, but I genuinely was surprised that it wasn't just another turd.
Yeah okay it's not perfect, but I thought it was far better than most of the Paranormal Activity films. At least it had a bit of originality about it and it wasn't just trying to copy the others.There were a lot of clich√©s through-out but I thought they were used quite nicely and to good effect. The ending is a bit ""wtf"" but I still liked it, even if it was a bit typical, they throw a nice little random Easter Egg in with it to mix it up a bit.I'd say this one is definitely underrated and well worth a watch."
" Good movie
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,8,"This movie is a one off spin off from the other Paranormal Activity movies. It has nothing to do with the other movies, but even so it's well worth a watch"
" Actually pretty good compared to others
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,10,The title says it all. This is one of the best paranormal activity movies.
" Best (or tied for second best) entry to the series
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,8,"This is probably the best-paced entry into the series. I think this film would be more favorable to the general audience rather than to the horror fanatics. Admittedly, the scares on this one were IMO not on par with PA1 or PA3.However, it was a fun ride throughout with the decent scares that were present. The humor worked. The easter eggs and references to the past films were welcome. I was a huge fan of the ending and I think it was my favorite ending tied with PA3.Final rating: 8.5/10"
" Ok
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,5,Its all right. It's not good nor bad. It's a decent sequel but it's not as good as the first 3
" SCARY and awesome
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,7,"This movie is awesome, scary, startling, and creepy. Filled with tension and anticipation. there were numerous scenes where my eyes were so wide open and i didn't want to blink. i got goosebumps from the creepiness multiple times. and there are numerous memorable moments. i even replayed some of them like i do with awesome action sequences. my jaw dropped on more than one occasion.i really don't understand the hate ppl have for this movie. after a subpar 4th movie with a horrendous story that makes zero sense, this movie comes back strong. there are some contradictions between this movie and the 4th, so i've decided to personally retcon part 4.i considered giving this movie an 8 out of 10. But there were a couple of really dumb moments and things you can make fun of. but you can ignore them and still enjoy the movie.i enjoyed the characters, similar to how i felt about the beginning of part 4. i was enjoying the movie before the horror even started, with some decent comedy.
SPOILERS
the door at the end that causes them to travel back in time.... i'm not sure how it fully made sense, but i dunno, it didn't bother me at all. i was really into that scene. and we are watching a movie about the paranormal, i think we can be okay with time travelthe one dumb part that made me laugh so hard is the explanation that the reason it happens at age 18 is because the devil's number 666 adds up to 18. rofl rofl rofl rofl rofl. please delete that from the movie.Paranormal Activity 4 SPOILERS!!!!also this is where the contradiction comes in with PA4. if this happens at 18, why did they take hunter back when he was still a kid in PA4? at first i was thinking of it as a downside to PA-MO, but i decided to retcon PA4 instead."
" Great movie with Hispanic descent
",2020-03-01 00:00:00,8,I actually think this is the best paranormal activity movie by far! I love the hispanic descent.
" Warm.
",2020-02-15 00:00:00,6,"This film is the fifth in the ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise. It's a spinn-off which tells the story of Jesse, a young man who ends up being a victim of the witch society to which belonged the grandparents of Katie and Kristi, main characters in the initial films.I confess that I expected worse. The story is not as bad as I thought it would be and has its moments and some tension. However, there are continuity flaws, lack of logic and several inconsistencies. The scares, in turn, are excessively predictable. The biggest problem is that it does not present anything really new, in a kind of film whose recipe has come to wear out very quickly. Something I felt was an attempt to moderate the dead moments, one of the most tangible problems in previous films. An effort was also made to make a shorter film, where the pace of events was faster. This was a positive development.The cast is, for me, a group of illustrious strangers, in that I have never seen any of them in other works or, if I did, they went completely unnoticed by my eyes. It is not the kind of film we see for the brilliance of its actors, and thankfully ... the cast does what it needs to do but does not shine, nor does it have the material or direction that allows it.Personally, I feel that this film is quite warm: it is not bad enough to hate but it is also far from good. It suffers from many of the endemic problems in the franchise, but there is an effort to alleviate some of the most criticized points in previous films."
" Marked up as garbage in my book
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,2,"The original film creeped me out, as a die hard horror fan I am not afraid to admit that. But these sequels suck and get worse with each one. Whereas in the first film it was a basic plot about a couple getting spooked by a ghost now it's all about witchcraft and evil spirits.
Naturally this is filmed in the done to death found footage style, this being a particularly poor example. Two positives in my opinion were setting it in the Latino community, the other using an 1980's Simon Says electronic game as a kind of Ouija board. Nothing scary here and the end was, for me, a confusing mess. Utter waste of time."
" 2nd time stop making these
",2020-01-31 00:00:00,3,Horrible please stop making these movies we get it you found some crappy footage that is not scary.
" A good addition to the franchise
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,7,"After the abomination that was PA4, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Sure, it's your standard possession story, but I found it believable and reasonably well acted. The young guys were easy to like and their friendship really came through on-screen. It also had some great scary/eerie moments. All in all, I think the PA franchise has pulled itself back on track with this one. Definitely worth watching!"
" A Rise Above the 4th
",2020-01-10 00:00:00,6,"I really enjoyed this film, not as much as the first three of the series, but this one has a sort of real charm to it. We are out of the rich neighborhoods to an actual normal family who finds themselves in a terrifying adventure.Because the characters were normal I could relate to them. I have known people like these characters, the charm, the humor, etc. I just felt at home with this film.Once the paranormal activity happens it's pretty interesting but it seems to be pretty much the same things we have already seen. There was a few jump scares that got me, a few creepy moments that made me look around in my own dark room. We are given a little more answers than the previous films, however these answers just provide more questions, which can work if it hasn't been done four times already.I did enjoy the atmosphere of this film a lot better than the others, even though I would say it's not as good as the first three, it is definitely a step up in this new trilogy so to speak. I am a fan of B movies and sometimes bad movies in general because they can be fun. I know a lot of people didn't enjoy this film and I can see why, but I did enjoy this film a lot and I like the new direction and how I could relate to these characters. So like the previous one, you're either gonna like it or hate it, but that's up to you to find out. For me, I liked it but I didn't love it."
" So Incredibly Pointless
",2019-10-05 00:00:00,1,"Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones would be classified as a spin-off, but it has almost nothing related to the previous movies, making it not only it's own movie, but a very pointless one, and thus, it is the worst Paranormal Activity film in the series.The film is about teenager friends, Jesse and Hector, who graduate high school and try to enjoy summer. However, their neighbor gets murdered and they investigate the neighbor's apartment and find strange items.Later on, Jesse wakes up to finding a bite mark on his arm, and realizes he has supernatural powers and slowly but surely becomes possessed. So Jesse's friends have to try and help him out before it is too late.The film, out of all of the ones in the series, was the most boring and slow paced one. Mostly because it is the longest one in the series, and it was just ridiculously dull and dragged on and on for 1 hr and 41 mins.The acting was bad, and I did not care at all about any of the characters. There was literally nothing cool and interesting about these characters, and had no personality whatsoever.The story I felt was pretty dumb and cheesy. I'm glad they thought the idea of a demon haunting a family was getting old, so they tried something different. But it still was just really silly.Roughly about 90% of this film has nothing to do with the others. 10% is showing some things from the previous films, and the ending where Hector goes through a door that is apparently a time machine, and he ends up in the ending of the very first movie where Katie kills Micah. It just makes you wonder what was the point in making this lame film?The only little decent thing about it is they brought back Ali from the second film. She was my favorite character from that film and I was glad to see she was still alive and active. But she only has one minute of footage, so it sucked she didn't get more screentime.Bottom line, Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones was such a huge lackluster misfire that did not have to be made whatsoever. It's easily one of the most pointless and useless films to any franchise ever."
" Fans of the series will enjoy
",2019-05-09 00:00:00,8,"If you're a die hard PA fan and this will be a great movie. One of the best.Good acting, and the twist at the end relative to the first PA was a good surprise"
" Its was great . It will make you jump defo üò≤
",2019-05-03 00:00:00,8,"It was a good story behind this one, but to be fair they have thought about the storyline on everyone and im glad1, ive watched them all but out of them all this got me 3 times on the jump scare ive watched hundreds of horrors this got me good enjoy .........a tip don't drink a hot coffee or tea while watching you going to burn yourself lol"
" Jumpscares
",2019-04-23 00:00:00,2,"I love horror movies and i love a good scare, in this movie you could just predict when they would ""scare"" you. That's no fun..."
" Utterly... terrible
",2019-04-02 00:00:00,2,"What an utter disappointment. Having said that, I shouldn't really have expected much judging by the lack of quality in the other Paranormal Activity movies in the series.The 2007 first, and iconic, of the series (simply ""Paranormal Activity"") was - I have to say - excellent and ground-breaking. However, as is the case so often in the capitalisation of a good first, the subsequent movies in the series cumulatively degraded from bad to worse. This movie ""PA: The Marked Ones"") was simply awful... a boring, clich√©-ridden, mish-mash of bad acting, bad writing, bad production, badly directed nonsense.There's not a lot else to say about this. There's no particularly worthwhile underlying social and/or moral message to peruse, nothing to salvage it.Id have awarded a 2.5 star if one was available. As this is not available, I'll err on the lower side (as is my personal rule). So, I give a two-star rather than down at one-star simply because - believe it or not - I have seen worse movies..."
" This is up to the mark
",2019-03-23 00:00:00,10,"Don't know why people have rated this 5 stars, its way beyond 8 stars to be honest, either the people who watched this film were high on something or drunk, or either along with other ppl in a party hence they didn't see how well this film was made. It was more realistic and scary than a high budget full fledged movie which is just a decorated art film, this film is a realistic one, in which all the sequences were shot like a real video being shot by handy cam.. There was no any artistic epic background music, This is a concept of a found footage mixed with Mokumentary style, which i guess lots of people aren't acquainted with, they have no idea. They might have rated this low, because video was shaky and dark, but thats how its supposed to be, creating an environment which we actually live..! These has all the scary elements which should send chills down your spine like watching a bad dream, so this movie serves its purpose.. And people who watch horror movies with a blanket covered on their eyes should NOT rate them down here.. I have not revealed the story , but i loved this film..! It made on top of my list..."
" Never a letdown!
",2019-02-26 00:00:00,8,"If you like the other ones, you will not be disappointed. Give it 25 mins...and take off!"
" Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones unashamedly marked itself as one of the weakest.
",2019-01-25 00:00:00,3,"Did we need a spinoff? Was it necessary? The answer is quite simply no. But, in true low-budget franchise fashion, here we are. Stripping the entire essence of the 'Paranormal Activity' franchise by essentially merging a forgettable found-footage horror with the likes of 'Chronicle'. A high school graduate investigates the apartment of his murdered neighbour, believed to be a witch. He soon starts to experience unusual powers that slowly turns him against his friends. Nothing new to see here. Ineffective jump scares that can be predicted a mile away, aside from the cloth flying to the camera. One-dimensional characters doing stupid actions like going down dark basements and watching naked women from a Go Pro dangled in an air vent (naughty boys...). Frantic camera shaking that makes various scenes difficult to watch. Just stay still for flip sake! Acting so often terrible that it takes you right out of the film. ""Is it gone now?"" after removing the batteries from Simon (or in this case ""Ouija-Simon""). Unnecessary special effects that, for a low budget film, makes it look even worse. But the worst crime, the one that really tickles my walnuts, is this. Why are they filming everything!? Just because the other films did (for good reason) that Landon thought he needed to replicate that? There was no need for Jesse and Hector to film themselves going to a party and getting laid. Literally no point. Remove the nauseating handheld style and actually direct properly. This would've been far more effective at creating tension and suspense that the film clearly lacked! Atleast the links to 'Paranormal Activity' were fine I guess, if ridiculously forced. To be honest, the only thing I'm going to take away from this film is the cleansing of a soul through eggs. Now that, is ""eggsciting""."
" At least it tried to be slightly more original than the other sequels
",2018-10-09 00:00:00,5,"Not a big fan of this particular entry of the franchise, but I appreciate that it tried to do something somewhat different with the plot instead of the repeating the same formula of the previous sequels (Which were basically rehashes of the first film, but with different characters)Chavo the chihuahua dog is still the best character of the whole series."
" Ghost and Demons Ain't Just for Rich White People Anymore
",2018-09-20 00:00:00,9,"It's honestly one of the first times that I've felt proper representation in an American horror film before. Typically in horror films, it's a wealthy white family, living in a nice home in the suburbs, and then weird stuff happens and they die.It was refreshing to see this family dynamic, which I completely relate to, involved in the supernatural and demonic. It truly hit close to home, with its characters, the absent father who is always working, the grandmother who is incredibly religious and superstitious, and the close knit relationship with the neighbors. It was all well developed and I appreciate the filmmakers for doing their due diligence.The film itself was funny and compelling. It added new levels to the Paranormal Activity mythos that really only the first and third movie accomplished."
" I actually feel ripped off watching this on netflix
",2018-05-16 00:00:00,1,Considering its essentually free because of my subscription to netflix I feel like ive been robbed .Some guy gets superpowers from a mark .rubbish cgi rubbish film .Rubbish acting.
" SIMON SEZ THIS MOVIE REEKS
",2018-05-03 00:00:00,2,"This latest installment I found to be the least in the series. Kids graduate and start filming everything, attempting to show us Hispanics know nothing about filming. After Oscar kills Anna, and everyone seems to know this but the cops, our group of film makers break into her place so they can get their fingerprints at the crime scene and steal her book of demonic doorways. Later Jesse, talks to a Simon game, because Ouija boards are so passe. It seems the same possessed Chihuahua has bitten Jesse as Oscar. At some point in time they opt to tie the series all together by filming poorly lit scenes with people screaming and a camera going through a jerking motion, enough to cause inner ear sickness.Oh yes, the acting sucked too. Sick a fork in it. It's done.Parental Guide: F-bombs. Nudity?"
" One of the better ones.
",2018-03-16 00:00:00,6,"The Marked ones is without doubt one of the best films from the Franchise (first one apart.) It's the usual format, every stereotype included, kids, found footage, person turned away, being on top of the ceiling, but somehow this one has an air of originality about it. Unlike the last few films the character's are well rounded and for the first time likeable, so when things start happening to them you care. There's nothing particularly original here, the ending has definitely been done to death, but it doesn't seem to matter. Not bad at all."
" Nothing new to see here.
",2017-10-16 00:00:00,2,"A Latino spin-off from the inexplicably popular Paranormal Activiity found-footage series, The Marked Ones follows a group of friends, Jesse (Andrew Jacobs), Hector (Jorge Diaz) and Marisol (Gabrielle Walsh), who discover that strange occult rituals have been taking place in their apartment complex. Soon after, Jesse starts to act very strangely, and it gradually becomes apparent that he has been marked by a coven of witches who need him for one of their black magic shin-digs.Boring, predictable, unimaginative garbage with zero atmosphere and countless ineffective jump scares, the fifth Paranormal Activity film fails to bring anything new to the table, reeling off all the clich√©s that have become synonymous with the found-footage sub-genre. For about two seconds‚Äîwhen the witches ran screeching from the darkness only to be be blown away by shotgun‚Äîthe film actually held my interest, but for the rest of the time I was clock watching, longing for the closing credits.After what seemed like an eternity of characters wandering round in the dark, the end credits did indeed come, but only after the final surviving character went through a time-portal to come face to face with Micah and Katie from the first film. Why? How? What? I'm confused, but I really can't be bothered to invest the time trying to figure it out."
" Never expected it, but kinda did.
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,6,"I remember seeing this in the theaters years back and it scared the holy s**t out of me. Several of those scary scenes had me either cowering in my seat with my ears and eyes covered or ones that virtually made me fall out of my seat. The advertising embodied ""an ending you'll never see coming"" and I never expected that ending!I'm personally a die-hard fan of this franchise and I certainly think that this is the one that takes the cake. Watch these at your own risk!"
" Disappointing, :/
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,4,"I'm a very easy person to scare with this sort of thing, and I like to give movies as much credit as possible, even when they're not great. It's not horrible, but I was disappointed. It takes next to nothing to make me jump, but this didn't make me jump even once I'm sad to say. The acting was alright, and the different setting was a nice change of pace. But I feel like this should have been its own thing and not a sequel. There was little to no suspense build-up in my opinion (not to say they didn't try, but I don't think they pulled it off) so there wasn't much feeling of threat. *shrug* I don't know, I don't pretend to be any kind of expert critic of anything, but I'd say this was good for background at best :("
" Weak
",2017-02-03 00:00:00,5,"I didn't know it, but I watched the last two out of order. I thought Ghost Dimension came after PA4 until I stumbled upon this title. It really didn't make a difference though. This part was no essential link to Ghost Dimension. This title really could have stood on its own. In any case, everything after part 3 was remedial. They tried different things to breathe life into it but I'm still looking at a dead franchise.In this one the setting is Los Angeles. My guess is East L.A. They go a little further with explaining the weird happenings but still falling short of fully telling the audience what's it all about. Like PA4 though, there is no real reason to be parading around with a video camera. I've done this rant before and I will reiterate it for this review. Sometimes it makes sense to video things, other times it doesn't. I don't think I'm in the minority when I say that when your life is on the line, videoing is probably one of the last things you'd be concerned about. In fact, for most of your life in general you'd probably eschew videotaping--if not because of your own customs and beliefs, at least out of respect for others. As for me--don't come around me videoing everything. Hence, one of my problems with PA:TMO. There was no real, logical or socially acceptable reason to be videoing a lot of what went on. The first three parts were clever and made sense out of having a lot of video footage, PA4 and now PA:TMO have both been weak. Weak with the story, weak with the POV found footage and weak with the regurgitated sequence of events. This is number five, I know they made a number six and in my opinion they made three too many."
