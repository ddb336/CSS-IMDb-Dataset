" This film is better than it's score, but could have been more coherent
",2021-03-31 00:00:00,8,"This film has a really good styled direction and plays with some really interesting themes. I understand the flaws that have been outlined by comments below, a lot of which are valid.However, there are much worse films which are rated better than this. Whilst the plot is difficult and hard to follow, a bit incoherent and could have shaved at least 40 if not 50 minutes to get it's core message across, the fact is that it is interesting, with somewhat engaging performances and excellent style.I think it is 7.7-7.8, but I have given an overly high rating to average the score out better."
" Unbereable
",2021-03-29 00:00:00,4,The most ridiculous thing is Henderson's wife passing a makeshift bridge in high heels.
" Garbage of a movie
",2021-03-16 00:00:00,1,"Okay, so there is this tall building with many residents in it, and in the beginning we see a lot of blood - so we figure something crazy has happened, and then we are taken back three months earlier. One expects to see why everyone has gone crazy in this building, but it does not happen. At first the movie just drags on and on. The main character is always wearing a shirt and a tie, even when playing squash.
And then for no apparent reason everyone just goes crazy.
All you see is crazyness everywhere, like in the beginning. No explanation why? You are left watching it, trying to figure it out. Virus? Aliens?
A very sick, pointless, stupid, and disturbing movie.
How can people make trash like this and how can people star in it, and how can people even bother to watch it?
What was the point? To show how sick humankind has become?
I really don't understand.
But, I would have expected to see an explanation why the people in the buildinh have all gone crazy."
" One time watch!

" Hard to describe, but interesting
",2021-02-19 00:00:00,6,"I have not read the book by JG Ballard on which the movie is based, so cannot comment as to whether it is a good adaptation or not. As the title suggests, the movie is set in a high rise building, the less wealthy on the lower floors, the elite at the top, i.e allegorical to modern society. The acting is great and the visuals are superb, but the message the Director (Ben Wheatley) has to convey is rather blurred until the very end, and all we have for the most part are debauched parties. I found it interesting, but would not see it again. A case of Emperor's new clothes."
" Visually enticing - if occasionally nauseating - and hugely entertaining
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,7,"It took film producer Jeremy Thomas over four decades to bring J. G. Ballard's novel High-Rise to the big screen; having wanted to adapt it since the 1970s, he finally managed it in 2015, with up-and-coming British auteur director Ben Wheatley at the helm, fresh from directing his fourth feature, the folk-horror cult favourite A Field in England. And for the most part, it was worth the wait.
Based on a screenplay written by Wheatley's wife Amy Jump, High-Rise opens - like Ballard's novel - with Dr Robert Laing eating the leg of a dog in the broken down, corpse-littered high rise building that he lives in, before the narrative flashes back three months to reveal how things got to that point. Jump's screenplay adheres quite closely to the caustically witty novel, with socioeconomic themes carried over; thus, the rich live on the top floors of the tower block and the less well off at the bottom. The different levels of the social strata soon start to chaff and architect Anthony Royal's carefully planned and self-contained utopia rapidly starts to turn into a vision of hell. As society begins to break down, so too does the building, which is beset by power cuts and lift breakdowns. Symbolically, the fruit in the building's supermarket starts to rot and as the shelves starts to empty, brutal fights erupt over tins of paint. Like the novel, the film appears to be set in the seventies, as evidenced by the cars, costumes and copious cigarette smoking; cheekily, Wheatley brings to a close with an extract from a speech by Margaret Thatcher from 1976, retrospectively tying together Ballard's dystopian vision with Thatcher's Britain.
By the time he made High-Rise, Wheatley had already demonstrated his ability to blend stomach-churning horror and razor-sharp satire in Kill List and Sightseers as well as the aforementioned A Field in England, and he does it again here with brilliantly revolting results, from Laing skinning a human head as part of a pathology lesson at the start, to the mutilated corpses that litter the building by the end. But this isn't just an exercise in gore: having made an asset of location filming in the English countryside for several of his previous films, here Wheatley creates a nightmarish scenario against a backdrop of superbly well designed angular studio sets that he manages to make simultaneously claustrophobic and starkly spacious. Cinematographer Laurie Rose produces some gorgeous, dreamlike camera work, exploiting the quirks of the sets (especially the mirrored walls the lift) to striking effect and Wheatley's tendency for surreal touches is evident in sequences such as Munrow's slow-motion leap to his death. Chaotic montages reflect the disintegration of both society within the tower and Laing's sanity; memorably, Wilder's death is filmed both in slow motion and through a kaleidoscope. Clint Mansell (formerly of Pop Will Eat Itself) composes the elegant, often haunting score, which suits Wheatley's vision perfectly.
With (presumably) a bigger budget to play with than on his previous films, Wheatley also assembles an A-list cast, lead by Tom Hiddleston who gives a convincing performance as Laing, a perpetual outsider who is socially awkward and doesn't fit in easily in any level of the building. He's joined by a charismatic and often astonishing Luke Evans as Wilder (possibly, Laing opines, the sanest man in the building), Sienna Miller as the seductive Charlotte, the great Jeremy Irons as the arrogant old Royal, and Keeley Hawes as Royal's parasitic yet abused wife. Even the minor parts are filled with talented actors, including British comic actors Reece Shearsmith and Dan Skinner as creepy orthodontist Steele and the taciturn, bullying Skinner. Elizabeth Moss of A Handmaid's Tale fame plays Wilder's meek, heavily pregnant wife Helen.
If there's a flaw here, it is that by the final third of the film, the plot is running out of steam, especially as the audience knows how the story will end, but it remains compellingly repulsive. Wheatley had already demonstrated his abilities with his previous films, but High-Rise showed that with more money to play with he could achieve even great things; it isn't perfect, but it is visually enticing - if occasionally nauseating - and hugely entertaining."
" Apocalyptic
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,7,"Ben Wheatley's adaptation of J.G. Ballard's High-Rise is faithful to the original material, representing a deformed apocalypse seen through technological upheaval and personal fragmentation. Recommended to those who liked Cronenberg's rendition of Crash and itch for more."
" Time for a party, who wants to see capitalism go wildly wrong?
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,6,"Amazing cast, phenomenal acting, beautiful cinematography but ultimately confusing. If art house style films aren't your thing, skip this. If they are, give it a shot. Ultimately enjoyable. Film has inspired me to read t book it's based on. Basic premise is: capitalism gone wildly wrong."
" Dark Urban Horror
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,8,"High Rise: A suicide jumper from the Tower hits a car bonnet and windscreen in slow motion, Tom Hiddleston roasts the haunch of an Alsatian (dog) he had earlier treated as a pet, wild orgies. Yes its a faithful adaption of the Novel. Jeremy Irons lives on top of the Tower in a Garden of Eden roof garden, literally playing God. His wife (dressed as Beau Peep) keeps a black sheep and a horse in the garden, both of which meet the same fate as the Alsatian when supplies run low.Is it an allegory of the state of British Society in the 1970s? Class War certainly breaks out in the the Tower as the lifts malfunction and electricity blackouts occur. Not an easy film to watch, I'll be thinking about it for a while to come, I'l probably see it a second time over the next week. 8/10."
" Poor adaptation, aims to shock, boring misfire
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,1,"Irrational, unlikeable characters...
Pointless violence...
Sex scenes that are NOT sexy...
the point of the ""story"" is pointlessly banal.
This is clearly intended to shock but it misfires badly.
Those claiming this to be sexy or confronting or ""deep and meaningful"" are pulling your leg.
This is boring crud. A total failure of purpose and a worthless adaptation from page to screen."
" Meh
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,4,I love Tom Hiddleston but I was confused through the whole movie
" This capitalist world critique brilliant
",2020-11-05 00:00:00,9,Could totally relate to the Wild character... I'm not cut out for it either. This world a capitalist Place. Won't let me find my equilibrium. I thought it was cut out for it but I'm not. Living in a high-rise requires a special type of behaviour. Acquiescent. Restraint. Restrained. slightly mad.The ones who are the real danger are of a self contained types like you know... those who are Impervious to the psychological pressures of high-rise life. Professionally detached. Thriving like an advanced species in the neutral atmosphere. This film interesting portrayal of how humans have moved from groups to individuals or small numbers in apartment living.
" I think this is how Hollywood sees itself...
",2020-10-20 00:00:00,1,"And we see them that way too.With this movie, I think they just decided to turn the cameras around and give us a glimpse into the self-guilt they wallow in.As far as a movie the rest of us can watch, this has all the artsy flair that critics go ga-ga for, but it leaves you no better for the experience.I guess you can surmise I didn't enjoy it. A-list actress and competently shot, but if you need a narrative that covers more ground, like I enjoy, this will feel completely like you have wasted your time most likely. Unless your side of entertainment is wallowing too. But trust me, life is too short for this sort of film."
" Waste of time
",2020-09-16 00:00:00,3,"A beautifully shot, well-acted waste of time.The high-rise is a simple allegory for class stratification. That appears to be pretty much it. The rest is just the grittiness of Fight Club without the cohesive message."
" Headache confusing and weird
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,1,"I made it about half way though this film, gained a mild headache. It's very confusing and strange. I believe perhaps the plot *may have gained later but this flick is so strange time to move on. It has some good actors in it it's just too weird for my taste."
" Moderately cohesive nonsense
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,7,"Mostly rubbish but in a consistently absurdist sort of way that makes it almost approachable. Your mind won't be blown and none of the characters seem to develop much, but for all the violence *almost* none of it seemed gratuitous. I enjoyed it, and in the end, what more can you ask from a pseudo-snuff film posturing as an allegorical commentary on classism?Watch if you want to escape into a fever dream reality about as deeply as you can sleep while actually feverish."
" Post apocalyptic tower block.......
",2020-07-21 00:00:00,2,"The opener with Reece Shearsmith was brilliantly funny and is worth the two stars....the rest of the movie is a descent into madness, both for movie and viewer.Leave your brain outside, as you have to maintain a belief that the people in this high rise are the some of the few people left in the world after an unknown or apocalyptic event....as things get so dire but nobody thinks to get help or go move somewhere else.A tower blocks residents (that go to work outside the building) have a class system and there is an uprising from the lower class.....then it descends into madness of eating pets/ killing each other and rape.....all while this goes on, only 1 police officer attends and walks away without intervention.This type of movie has been done much better by movies like Snow piercer, which in my opinion was a great movie but High rise is absolute garbage."
" Very bad in every way, do not watch it.
",2020-07-09 00:00:00,1,"If this film was reviewed as being an ""art film"", i.e. incomprehensible and extremely boring to watch then it would score a ten. Scoring it as a film designed to entertain an audience then it gets a 1, and that's only because a zero is not an option. Why it was set in the 1970s is a mystery as this adds nothing to the plot or anything else. The makers don't seem to understand the concept of a Sci-Fi film, Sci-Fi films have to be set in the future so a film made in 2015 set in the 1970s makes no sense, unless it's a time travel film plot which this one wasn't. It has to be in the top ten all time worse ever films."
" Watch the first hour and stop
",2020-07-08 00:00:00,4,"The first hour of the movie is really good and makes you think the movie is going somewhere. It's not. After that first hour, it takes a complete nosedive and makes absolutely no sense. It's like half of it was written and directed by someone else in the second half. I had no idea what was going on and it seems like it was a complete mess for the sake of looking ""artsy"""

" Air-Conditioned Nightmare
",2020-07-02 00:00:00,8,"'The Masque of the Red Death' crossed with 'Brazil', with the seventies rather than the forties as it's template (although no costume designer has ever dared accurately to recreate just how hideous the seventies actually were) in hallucinatory saturated colours. With the presence of Elisabeth Banks to remind us of 'Mad Men'.Unfortunately even Ballard's wildest dystopian imaginings are becoming hard-pressed to parody the 21st Century as it is already shaping up."
" Rubbish....complete rubbish.
",2020-07-02 00:00:00,1,"Only managed 21 minutes of this rubbish, I should of known it was going to be rubbish, it's got Sienna Miller in it."
" Bizarre, incomprehensible mishmash of nonsense
",2020-07-02 00:00:00,1,"Great cast - that's the only good thing about this movie. Don't waste your time, you'll be mad if you do."
" Stylish But Odd
",2020-07-02 00:00:00,8,"A retro 70's-style quasi-futuristic and metaphor-filled tale of an elite high rise in an English suburb where the residents are all obsessed with their class-level and are slowly going mad.A bit like Sliver crossed with A Clockwork Orange. It's got a great premise that peters out and never truly delivers on its initial promise. It is an admirable attempt, however. It's more concerned with style over substance in many ways. Or maybe it's over my head and requires more study. I don't want to discourage anyone from seeing this, it's odd but still engaging."
" Not allegory.
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,10,"I didn't know that this was not a film from the 70's so part of my enjoyment came from the disbelief that the themes could be so poignant today.I find it interesting that some people refer to this film as an allegory for class divide, when to me it's literally about class divide. It's loose nightmare narrative reminds me of ""Mother!"" but in comparison, High-Rise is grounded in reality while still evoking the same extreme emotional response.Maybe the cascading disasters of 2020 make the accelerating nightmare of devolving capitalism in this film, less absurd that the reception it received in 2015.This film left me with an overwhelming sense of despair and motivation to reflect on my morals, views, relationships, spending habits, work & lifestyle. I'm not too attached to who I was before watching this, that I can give it- all the stars."
" Terrible.
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,3,"This movie made no sense. Take Snowpiercer as an example. In that movie, the whole of society lived on that train, so initially, the lower class people had no choice but to deal with the conditions. In High-Rise, the planet is still completely habitable and society is functioning just as it is now. So why in the hell does this one apartment building turn into a post apocalyptic nightmare just because of minor inconveniences? Why are people eating dogs because the grocery store inside the building has been ransacked? Just go to a normal store! I understand the movies metaphors for people's desire for ""status,"" but the story is such an incoherent mess that the moment to moment scenes and lack of any discernable character motivations make the entire thing a long unsatisfying slog."
" High-Rise (2015)
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,5,A more ultra violent and dark film of the human condition in a high-rise building in a near future this would have been an amazing depiction of abstract film making but the film maker loses in his smooth execution by excessively adding unnecessary graphic in the film deviating from the plot. ( More like Style over substance sceanrio)Overall - 2.5/5
" I'd give it 0 stars if I could
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,1,"I do love Tom Hiddleston, but this was such a terrible movie. Unrealistic. Even from a fantasy perspective, it still couldn't hold it's own."
" Style over Substance
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,5,"Typical English film. Very quirky and weird like ""Brazil"".....incoherent story structure, lots of bizarreness, fantastical grandiose acting, etc.A film based far more on style than structure; so it's replete with incredible imagery, odd cuts, incomprehensible sequences of dialog and actions by the characters. Wouldn't even say there are characters in this film, but representations of ideas and feelings. Another film this reminds me of is ""Mother"". Exactly the same kind of thing...characters are ideas and representations, a lot of allegory. The scenes of mayhem just like in ""Mother"" too.It's not meant to be a structured story with character development, coherency, a journey. It is what it is, more of a collage of visuals and concepts.The editing was very avante-garde. The director seemingly straight from the music video industry....he would make an excellent one (dunno anything about him, he probably already is?).I hated ""Mother"" but i really enjoyed this movie. ""Brazil"" is one of my all-time favorite movies, but this isn't. It's certainly recommended viewing tho. because it's so stylistic. Worth seeing for that.Probably give it a 5/10 ... the marks coming from the technical side of things.Rating based on a binary 1 or 0, or 0.5, for each of the ten categories.....Directing, Cinematography, Editing, Acting, Script-Writing, Story/Synopsis, Music/Sound, Effects, Originality, Je Ne Sais Qua."
" Hypnotic...
",2020-03-05 00:00:00,8,"It¬¥s truly a bold attempt to try and adapt this novel. And I must say it works for me, I just wished they decided to turn this in a six part series, because compared to the book, the whole story feels and is really rushed. If one has read the book, one can see that everything is there. It¬¥s just crammed all in to two hours. So the transgressions of the inhabitants from sane to mad as hell is (understandably) not understandable for most people. But even then, it¬¥s quite the hynotic ride of a movie and I highly recommend it,It¬¥s one of the best weird movies of the decade. Thanks for trying and (almost) succeding."
" Sadly incoherent but memorable
",2020-03-03 00:00:00,7,"Aside from Jeremy Irons, who manages to be sympathetic even here, this film paints a lurid picture of unsympathetic people in a cruel, hierarchical society that gradually implodes. When you read Ballard's book the narrator's voice is what holds you and takes you through the nightmarish plot. The narrator's downward spiral seems natural and is almost imperceptible until it's too late. The film does not capture this sort of cohesion in narration. It probably would have worked better if it did not start at the chaotic end and flashback, and if the editing was not so fast and showy, but if it moved at a more measured pace, slowly creating a real 'stable' world which it could then tear apart. As it is, the people and society in this film are unpleasant from the word go, and if anything, become a bit more likable when they openly lose all inhibition and turn nasty. Again, only Jeremy Irons emerges as sympathetic or even interesting. For all that, I still enjoyed the nastiness at times - the sheer energy with which it relentlessly attacks the viewer, the look of the production design, bits of music - or muzak - effectively used, and the way the film reveals a certain brittle btchiness underneath our polite society - though it was unclear to me if, like the book, it is set in the 70s, or some post-modern mishmash of periods."

" Not A Drama

" A Display of Cruelty
",2020-01-11 00:00:00,5,"This is perhaps the meanest picture ever made. It is about many things and nothing. Autistic and non-empathetic people should enjoy it immensely. There is something for every serial killer, psycho and pervert in the world: psychological cruelty, corporal cruelty, animal cruelty, child abuse, sexual deviation. I suppose one could attempt to analyze it on the grounds of being a metaphor for the future (God help us) but it degenerates too quickly into a free for all slash and bash-a-thon to be taken seriously. I'd consider it to be a primer for young sadomasicists and sexual voyeurs of snuff films. Sadly a lot of good actors are wasted. Like 'Caligula' back in the late 70s, a lot of actors got together to make art and ended up making porn. This is just porn for the diseased of mind."
" Do Not Watch It
",2019-12-09 00:00:00,4,"Have you seen the orgy on Sausage Party? Well, this movie has orgys, too much. But without the comedy.Besides the non sense orgys which are mere metaphors of something I guess, the plot start ok, but fails to make the viewer think, if that's what they wanted to do with this movie.I know, you searched this movie because the trailers were good and has an incredible cast.... And yeah they act really good... but this is that kind movie. The movie that starts (first 5') whith Tom Hiddleston, eating a dog because there is nothing else to eat in the building.It's not post-apocaliptic, is just a big metaphor of humanity making a mess. And really... it's not post-apocaliptic. Neither Sci-Fi, it's just a building! No science fiction at all!Have you seen Snowpiercer? That movie was good, and showcased this thing of classes and violence. High Rise just fails to make something similar. I've seen weird movies, and some are good of course. This one tried to be one, and failed.Do not waste your time. Tom Hiddleston is cute, but no, it isn't enough to save the movie."
" this theme has been done- much better
",2019-11-23 00:00:00,2,"This is very stylized, and although the blurb gives it away, no surprises, there is hope for an interesting rendition.What was it called- the Train that runs forever in the frozen wasteland of the world- with an upper class, enjoying massages, hairdressers- the best food- and the lower cold and scrounging for scrapes- unaware there is a 1st class- they kill off the lower class (think trains classes) to control the population. someone from the back of the train figures it out! opps!also Metropolis the iconic silent film. and there are at least 2 others, a top world Eutopia and a bottom world that suffers and toils.so there is this impossible world, of no money, elite favored over those below who can't afford the top floors. Kind of a post apocalyptic world, steampunk, in that it is now but the future and the past. Confusing.
and the carnage in the bottom floors, I don't quite understand. I guess it de-volved. It is vaguely reminiscent of ""Brazil"" - in social structure,unfortunately while it starts off with promise- Tom & Jeremy- it goes nowhere slowly. I wanted to see the end, to see where they landed. I didn't understand the electricity shortage- is it the building- or everywhere- the lack of food, you don't have to leave to shop -big box store floor15- and why was everyone killing each other? in rubble. is the whole city, country like this? the blood and mayhem goes to the top floor. Jeremy, the ""Architect"" of the demise. blood, mayhem, murder and Genocide. in a way looks like ""Yugoslavia"" Serbo-Croatia ""civil war""-And why or how is Jeremy limping with a cane, from a weird accident on the building site (symbolic) but playing squash and running?"

",2019-09-16 00:00:00,8,"Do you have a brain cell? Did you like the Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead, Orwell's Animal Farm? Do you like abstract films that deal with society and stratification?
There was a time creators thought of a future. Now we live on the scraps of better people's dreams creating problems for ourselves that don't exist just so we can be outraged.
Great Acting, Directing and Production. Not for the snowflake generation. No unicorn flavored ponies here.
Beautifully stylized metaphor for the collapse of civilization."
" Brilliant unless you can't handle chaos

Some people have said this is Snowpiercer in an apartment building, Snowpiercer was more cut-and-dried this movie uses a chaos of information and concepts, for people with linear minds it will drive them nuts for those who are more artistic they will see the brilliance in this movie. Every character is heavily flawed but have moments of redemption followed by moments of folly.
It's the world in a microcosm. Watch it late at night when it's quiet."

",2019-06-15 00:00:00,3,"I like Ballard and I like the director of this movie so I gave it a try. Had to stop watching after 30 minutes. The plot got nowhere, the actors all gave annoying performances. No fun, no suspense, no drama. I think they thought it was art. In my eyes it wasn't.
Maybe some tax-thing? They definitely had money to burn.If you are looking for a movie that treats similar themes in a more intelligent, subtle and elegant way watch The Exterminating Angel."
" Rises high at first, then quickly falls down and crashes with a thud
",2019-06-14 00:00:00,5,"'High Rise' had a lot of promise. An amazing and unique concept, same goes for the source material which is a gripping read and stands out conceptually. Ben Wheatley seemed the right director, as he does have a great style. It had a cast that one really should not go wrong by, the actors all immensely talented. The trailer looked great visually and indicated an intriguing film. Will admit that there were doubts though, as the book is yet another book that is difficult to adapt.Doubts that sadly proved to be correct on the most part, the reasons have been said frequently here and there is not an awful lot more to add. There are books around that should really have been left alone due to being unadaptable. 'High Rise' is one of them. Other book to film adaptations seen recently that fit under this distinction are 'House of the Spirits' (which would have been much better as a mini-series), 'Naked Lunch', 'Cosmopolis' and 'Crash', just to say that despite singling out three David Cronenberg films he is a director generally held in high regard by me. Coming back to talking about 'High Rise' as a film, it is a case of style over substance and is a difficult to rate film and a case of the trailer being much better than the film. Didn't love it, didn't hate it, am very conflicted really.It starts off so promisingly. The first half hour, or first act, is very intriguing and easy to follow, drawing one right in. Throughout, 'High Rise' looks fantastic. Actually thought it was one of the best-looking films of the year, the production design alone left me in awe and the cinematography perfectly captures the dystopian nightmarish nature of the story. Clint Mansell's score is both haunting and rousing, adding a lot to what is going on and even enhancing it without over-bearing. Wheatley's direction is very uneven, but he does excel in the visual style which is very imaginative.The cast are also remarkably great, it is amazing that they did so much with material that they are well above of. Luke Evans especially brings a lot of intensity, charisma and poignancy to the one character the film tries to develop and the one character the viewer feels anything for. Tom Hiddleston carries 'High Rise' with a lot of charm and commands the screen with ease. Jeremy Irons has fun with his role, while also being menacing and providing his distinctive gravitas. Elizabeth Moss is also a standout. The rest of the cast are underused but still make the most of what they have, nobody's bad here.Such a shame though that 'High Rise' goes downhill rapidly too early in a rather sudden and very violent change of tone and the rest of the film becomes very disjointed. It became increasingly dull with no real momentum, and the middle act especially felt over-stretched and padded. Giving the sense of the film being far too long (by about an hour, the middle half hour could easily have been cut out) and the lack of momentum showing an indication of the story overall being too thin structurally. It is not just dull, it becomes confusing and over-complicated to the point of incoherence. While Wheatley excels on the style aspect of 'High Rise', the substance is messy and too detached, that is what was meant by his direction being uneven. Sad because on paper he seemed the right director.Felt nothing for the characters, other than Evans' Wilder they are sketchy caricatures kept too much at a distance emotionally. Emotionally, 'High Rise' left me cold, felt very little tension or emotion because there was so much frustration at the lack of momentum in the middle act and the chaotic over-complicated confusion that reached breaking point by the rather abrupt and head-scratching ending. Other frustrations are the vapid and self-indulgent script and a quite interesting moral on paper being executed heavy-handedly.Overall, very hard to rate and the polarisation in the reviews is understandable. Started off so well and with a lot of great things (especially the visuals and cast) but the rest of the film badly underwhelmed. 5/10"

" Weird and hard to follow
",2019-03-12 00:00:00,4,"It appears to be a metaphorical tale of society's base appitites and urge to descend into anarchy. It has elements of class warfare, elitism, impacts of privilege, mans need for violence and just plain madness.
It has a wonderful cast and visually it's intriguing but ultimately it's too hard to follow and unsatisfying. It just makes no sense. We gave up half way. Life's too short..."
" The whole film is too stream-of-consciousness
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,3,"The whole film is too stream-of-consciousness and has a variety of characters. It is adapted from the anti-utopian novel of the 1970s, but it has not been improved according to the present situation, which leads to the fact that its imaginary plot is totally divorced from reality and makes people unable to understand the root cause of its occurrence and the ugliness of its imagery. As a result, the film has become a plausible farce. Plus the chaotic scenery, skipping clips and the so-called camera language make the modern audience drowsy."

" Fascinating and funny, it nevertheless descends into wanton sexuality and ultra-violence; only for the over 18 and open-minded crowd
",2018-11-08 00:00:00,7,"Based on 70's JG Ballard's amazing book, the film begins with disturbing images of a blood-soaked Laing (Tom Hiddleston), a ransacked apartment and a dead canine. Soon, it goes back to the ""bright and shiny"" 100 floor modern high-rise which Laing has chosen for his new residence. It is near his job as a medical-teaching physician. Indeed, the High-Rise is breathtaking in its beauty and amenities. Meant to be a community within its brick and mortar confines, the building has a school, a grocery store and a fitness floor, including a pool midway up the structure. Its creator, Royal (Jeremy Irons) occupies the fabulous penthouse with his wife, rooftop gardens, a bevy of servants, and spacious rooms. Ah, but ""inequality"" has been built into the community. The upper third floors belong to the rich and famous; they have a private elevator and the best parking spots in the huge lot. The middle floors are inhabited with folks like Laing, not extremely wealthy, but respectable middle-class professionals. As one can guess, the lower third of the residence is occupied by the strictly lower-to-middle folks, mostly families with lots of children. In this part resides tv journalist Wilder (Luke Evans) and his very pregnant wife (Elizabeth Moss) and two other children. Curiously, when Laing moves in, he has a pile of boxes, which he doesn't begin unpacking, and a photo of his sister which he tacks on the wall. One day, on his balcony, Laing is almost hit with a falling cocktail from Charlotte (Sienna Miller) who resides one floor above, with her ultra-bright son. Admiring the beautiful lady and her wild-and-wanton persona, Laing eagerly accepts her invitation to a party on the upper floors. Almost before one can see it, the building and its residents begin to break down. The elevators for the lower residents stop working, which means a lot of stair walking for some. Then, the garbage starts to pile up in the shoots and no one takes care of it. Similarly, the store starts having more empty shelves and the pool crowd gets into fights about who can swim and when. Wilder tries to work up emotion for a ""war"" with the snooty on the top floors. Cars get broken in the lot and, horribly, a jeweler commits suicide, landing on an expensive sports car. No one cares to find out why. Laing, once button-down and immaculate in his appearance, starts to dishevel as he sometimes believes Wilder's approach is the best. Soon, all chaos breaks loose, with wild sex parties and violence among the residents. Is this Lord of the Flies High-Rise? Yes. This fascinating and darkly humorous film is really not for most. Its graphic violence and sex, while not truly plentiful until the last third of the film, is repulsive. Yet, how would WE ACT IN SIMILAR circumstances is the main question and its answer is horribly true to the nasty heart of humanity. Hiddleston is great and all the other actors sharp as well. Scenery, costumes from the seventies, and the energetic, wanton direction are fine, too. Above all, Ballard was a witness to the ""decay"" of mankind when he was held, as a child, in a Japanese prison camp, so he knows what evil man is capable of inflicting on fellow man. Do try to find it, if you think you can handle the above descriptions, for it is a one-of-a-kind film in the sea of movies presented each year."
" Descends into utter chaos, following its source story, but can't quite conflate its themes.
",2018-10-27 00:00:00,5,"Much like it's source story, 'High-Rise (2015)' descends into utter chaos in its latter half but, unlike that same story, it almost feels like this is an accident, although it almost certainly isn't. Here, the flick just ends up feeling aimless, unable to conflate its anarchic themes with its newfound anarchic film-form and narrative structure - as admirable as it is that it attempted to do so, to tell the story through the very fabric of its film-making. It's just a bit boring, to be honest, and it gets progressively more so as it goes along, ultimately making for a pretty disappointing picture that isn't really entertaining despite the fact that it features some interesting visuals, several more-than-decent performances, a few ambitious themes and that it is told with a fairly solid style. 5/10"
" High Boredom

" High-Rise is a really nice art movie.
",2018-04-11 00:00:00,10,"In this dystopian world based on J. G. Ballard's 70s novel, there is no room for realism, but excessively absurd situations take over the story. Here, there are social criticisms and humor for those who are so made, yet far from what suits everyone. The stylistically interesting weighs up the increasingly flawed location, where Jeremy Irons lives at the top of this gated community for those with money, and for those with devilish lot of money. At the top of a horse, on the fifth floor you can shop for a week. It is rumored about a brothel on any of the floors.The skyscraper is so ridiculous that it is impossible to miss it totaly absurd metaphorism , where tenants are cells, and corridors and lifts are its blood circulation. But then the lifts begin to stop and the power disappears periodically. The fruit in the supermarket rots, injustice takes its right. In the midst of all this is the relatively sobra Tom Hiddleston, looking out over the misery that climbs to the top of the money line.Stylistically, this evocation of a world ""prone to fits of mania, narcissism and power failure"" is spot-on; you can smell the smoke and booze in which everyone is marinated, unhinged adults behaving like unruly children. And when that happens in the movie I'm completely speechless."
" A brilliant and interesting movie similar to Snowpiercer for some aspects
",2018-04-05 00:00:00,7,"If in ""Snowpiercer"" it was a train here it is a building, a skyscraper to be precise, which represents, both metaphorically and explicitly, a society that is structured on several levels going to create a certain social hierarchy similar to the one in which we live every day but represented in a clearer way.
In ""Snowpiercer"", a film I loved and which has several points in common with this, this had been made more sad, grim and resigned; here in ""High-Rise"" instead it was represented in a completely different way: extreme, absurd but credible in its grotesque and exasperated context.
This gives the film a unique personality and a certainly special and complex atmosphere.
Unfortunately, its initial security in what it says and shows is lost in some points and especially in the final part, in which the screenplay becomes more confusing and slightly less convincing.
But in general the film is a brilliant, even if not completely original, experience that reflects how a poorly managed management, even just a small group of people that constitutes a society, can not work, even more so if the social strata are so close together and net at the same time.
Beautiful cinematography that colors the film with tones and nuances perfectly suited to the type of film that is, excellent scenery.
Experimental and over the top lines that in all ways seeks, and partly successfully, to distinguish itself from all the commercial products to which we are usually accustomed.
Excellent interpretations, especially that of Luke Evans and Tom Hiddleston, pity however for a characterization of the characters a bit 'hasty."
" An absolute mess.

" Minimalistic
",2018-02-02 00:00:00,7,"It as an almost minimalistic setup where in a skyscraper artists in different states of their carreers try to find a way to cohabitate. As in real life this ""togetherness"" relies on the submission of some by others.
Above all the intrigues of the daily life is the ""administrator"" of this social enterprise.
It gets chaotic when the submitters lose their power and the submitted refuse to fulfill their duties. Very interesting perspective with a touch of nonesense."
" Masterfully shot, but needed a better script to convey Ballard's vision
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,7,"JG Ballard's book High Rise is a dystopian masterpiece. It is a small book, less than 200 pages, in which words are used sparingly, and yet manages to paint vivid pictures in your head. It starts with Laing eating a dog, as if that was the natural conclusion of all the events that preceded it, and then takes you on that journey during which all human of all decency is replaced by tribal, basic survival instincts.
Ben Wheatley's film is well acted and atmospheric. It is also wonderfully photographed and choreographed, but it ultimately fails to convince the audience about the inevitability of its ending. The pace is wrong. The audience is not shown the importance of the supermarket or the car incidents, and the tenants' behaviour spirals out of control too quickly to be believable. Everything happens in the first 45 minutes, so the remaining hour becomes dull and boring.
The book was a dark portrayal of human nature. It convinces us that we are only a few bad incidents away from cold blooded murders and incest. The film is perhaps too faithful to the book to convey the same meaning. 
To me, it feels as though Wheatley respected the source material so much he failed to change it where necessary to accommodate a different medium. It's similar to what Linklater did with a scanner darkly (which I loved, but not as much as the book... of course), for which he seemed to take full scenes from the book without providing a meaningful synthesis. 
As someone who read the book and appreciated all the details, I still enjoyed watching the movie, and I am sure I will watch it again, but with a different mindset, considering it as a piece of art. But I can see why people who were not familiar with the material could not appreciate it, and I find it a real shame."
" We are all on the same level
",2017-12-10 00:00:00,8,"May contain plot spoilers, although the film is not plot driven.This is a film heavy in the metaphor and symbolism thing. It lacks plot continuity and events that don't make sense in the civilized world as pointed out by its own characters. The film is about a High-Rise where people are screened to buy condos based on the need of the architect, a man who lives in the luxurious penthouse garden he made for his wife. The lower class live on the bottom. They all pay the same for resources but the resources are allocated to those in the upper levels, a statement about the allocation of the world's resources. Note the supermarket fruit is arranged from pure to moldy on the shelves.Dr. Laing (Tom Hiddleston) is ""self contained and detached"" from the class or level struggle. Richard Wilder (Luke Evans) is a documentary film maker who is leading an anarchist rebellion against Royal (Jeremy Irons).The setting of the picture is circa late 60's (note the Che poster) although people in higher levels look modern and sleek. People are heavy smokers. The film is filled with telling statements and symbols... ""Another prison documentary"" The architect is living in the index finger tip of his creation. ""The future already taken place."" This film is for Indy lovers who question capitalistic values.Guide: F-word, sex, nudity"
" Had some potential but quickly becomes nonsensical and stupid
",2017-12-08 00:00:00,3,"London, 1970s. Dr Robert Laing moves into a new high-rise apartment building. It is soon apparent that there is a class-divide between the wealthier upper-floors inhabitants and the middle-class lower- floors tenants. Over time this escalates into full-blown war...Had some potential as an examination of class divides and their consequences, also as a dark drama. The opening scene was intriguing, but it soon becomes apparent that the only reason to continue watching is to see how we end up there. Hardly anything from the period in between makes sense, and just gets more and more random as time goes by. Yes, the idea was to ramp up the level of anarchy, but some degree of continuity was still called for. Becomes pretty stupid after a while.The whole us vs them thing is also laid on so thick and unobjectively that engagement is non-existent. Good cast - Jeremy Irons, Sienna Miller, Elizabeth Moss, Tom Hiddleston , James Purefoy, Luke Evans - do their best but are massively hamstrung by a very weak script and one-dimensional direction."
" horrendous
",2017-10-19 00:00:00,1,"Absolutely terrible! Worst film I have watched this year. I like Ben Wheatley, I really liked Kill List and Sightseers was fun too, but this takes the biscuit, quite shocking to be honest at how bad it is. The cast are good, but the story is a bunch of mumbo jumbo, Tom Hiddleston had a dream sequence early on, which was quite funny as the whole film seemed like a weird bizarre dream sequence that did not really make sense. The film was trying to be clever, but it was not, it just amazes me what the BFI puts money into and proves to me that its not what the story is about, but more about who you are and who you've got attached to your project, there's an irony about the social ladder here. There was no diversity, even the dog was white, I think it was set in the seventies, so there would have been minorities in the UK then, unless that was meant to be another supposed clever part about the story, hah, hah. As I was watching it, I became more amazed as it went along, I could not believe what I was watching and neither could my friends, was a couple of funny lines ""You made him"", but not much else was entertaining to say the least all made for approximately $20million!"
" Afwul
",2017-09-15 00:00:00,1,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever watched. And I watch A LOT. But, this one definitely shocked me so much so that I cannot find the right words to describe it.

" Very pretty but ultimately a disappointment
",2017-07-28 00:00:00,5,"Gorgeously shot, lovely on many levels, (Im looking at you Big H), but High-Rise fails to deliver even 10% of the distopia that was the novel. The script is shoddy and the edit, at times, incomprehensible. I found the choices of which characters to loose and which were created out of nowhere (or drastically changed) to be based purely on someones idea of what would be ""cool"" and did nothing to move along the underlying discomfort of the story itself. Female characters are marginalized or changed into catty go-go girls, and the male characters are all brutish before their allotted time. The result is an incomprehensible jumble. Where the novel flows like a putrid river, the film stumbles and shambles about completely missing the (granted) complex social commentary on class structure that J. G. Ballard went to such pains to construct. It IS beautifully shot. Decors are exquisite and the acting is marvelous at times. So, coupons le poire en deux - 5 stars."
" High Heaven
",2017-07-19 00:00:00,10,"High-Rise will eventually be recognized as the first definitive cinematic exploration of where we actually reside in our postmodern world. Radical Autonomy, the ethos of postmodernism, is now the norm of culture. All forms of actual community have been destroyed, especially the cornerstone of all expansive forms of social community, the nuclear family (Yorgo Lathimos' masterpiece, Lobster, focuses exclusively on this element, yet his hero is, unlike Dr. Laing, totally oblivious, but is finding his way haphazardly). And in High-Rise, pregnant Helen is the last woman/person standing in defending this cornerstone, this Alamo of hers in the belly of the Beast (the Building as metaphor for the culture we are now imprisoned in).Helen stands valiantly alone in her battle, a Don Quixote absent the fantastical egotism, staring realistically and directly into the pit of uncompromising alienation all around her, but she will find an ally in the Great Liberator, Dr. Laing, the beating heart of the film, a real glimpse at hope, not sentimental rubbish, revealing the basic failing of postmodernism beneath its clutter of hedonistic excess: a world programmed solely for each individual to get his/her needs met, setting everyone off and against each other in selfish paroxysms.The visionary architect of the film is appropriately named Royal‚Äî that's Ayn-Randian Royalty, the fully actualized visionary architect who will, as the greatest autonomous artist in history, restore what is grand, as King and God‚Äîtowering above all other artists in a ruling progressive ""professional class"" determined to kill the past to create the future. His determination is to restore the essence of what the Western World sacrificed to gain radical autonomy: true, not pretend, community. That's the heart of the great existential joke of the film, and what makes the film a true postmodern satire of epic proportions, and why each repeated viewing brings on ever more hilarity. For example, it is deemed by the upper- floor residents that children should not be allowed in the pool because they can't control their bladders (the upper classes have actualized their autonomy and simply would not submit to any demands from any other, especially a child, so why even have one?), and every time the cameraman returns to filming the pool, you can see how editors bled yellow into the water where the children swim. Trust me‚Äîit does get funnier on every repeated viewing!The professional class (progressives) harnessed most of its power from the psychoanalytic movement, what had Kafka scream, ""No more psychology!"", and the Psychiatrist of High-Rise, Talbot, clarifies Kafka's concern, a psychology of self- centeredness in the radical promotion of self over everything, including every other, including children (""I can't be there for my child until I get myself together, dammit!""), and including history itself! The basic distinction between a liberal and a progressive is the latter seeks to kill the past to create its vision of a future, independent of all other influences, to make it pure! And the liberal seeks always to remember the past to avoid the existential horrors we get looped around in throughout history! And of all the professionals in the film, Richard Wilder comes closest to being an old school liberal force, but in whose animalistic pursuit of the truth in a concrete jungle turns himself into his own worst enemy, in the end fulfilling the Building's demand that he rape and murder to fully actualize his radical sense of justice! He is assigned by the Building to demote Charlotte who has gotten far too comfortable in her successful orchestrations of parties at all levels of engagement, and why a quick bond develops between her and the protagonist, Dr. Laing, both accomplished navigators, but Charlotte navigates inside the Beast to acquire maximum benefits, and Laing comes from a world of broad knowledge and seeks not only to move comfortably, but to seek restoration of nuts and bolts of true humanity in the process (an attitude glimpsed for flitting moments inside once suffocated tear-drops).Wilder is a man engrossed in a mission to uncover evil and promote the good, but he lives simultaneously in both worlds, the ancient liberal world of honor and fighting doggedly to reveal the truth, and the postmodern world where everyone is out for him/herself, and damn the truth in process!, and in his animal pursuit of truth and justice, he is taken over by the malevolence of the Building, and finally realizes the Building (postmodern culture) was always more powerful than he, and his dark side ends in manifesting absolutely in the power he utilizes to defeat the Building! Wilder more than anything wants to win, and so he ends in sacrificing his wife and children and his very humanity for this bold adventure into wining, not loving.Dr. Laing is the postmodern warrior par excellence. He not only has embraced his Iliad, but ignores an Odyssey (no home to return to). Charlotte chooses for Laing when she throws the picture of him and his dead sister to the floor, the last remnant of Laing's delusory clinging to a world that has passed away. He will not be conned by any peripheral, especially from the ""progressive class"" and its relentless Kantian maze of dysfunctional morality and ethics, although because he and Royal are both absolute visionaries, they share an affection for each other in this regard. But Laing, like Helen, is no Don Quixote trapped in egotism. He is willing to strip away every peripheral to arrive at the nuts and bolts of what is truly true about the human condition. Wilder gave him all he knew, and so did Charlotte and Royal and everyone else, and now it is left to Laing who knows where the heart of restoration begins, with everyone loving the baby born into a genuine community, the first incipient model of nuclear family restoration unto fully actualized community."
" If you are watching this film on a plane and the plane begins to crash - trust me; your day has just dramatically improved.
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,1,"The most frustrating thing of all about this film is that it starts out with quite a bit of promise. Visually stimulating: interesting and tantalisingly bizarre story and characters - ""where will this rabbit hole lead?"" you wonder. Well my wife wanted to go to sleep and I was intrigued enough to keep her up on a Sunday night to watch more. As a result I've just been screamed at, I'm apparently spending the night on the sofa and I have specifically registered with IMDb to warn you away from this bubbling pustule of a film. Frankly I'm lucky to be on the sofa - after that decision I'm fortunate not to be face down in a foot-deep bath. It would be more than I deserve.As I mentioned, after about twenty minutes or so the director seems to give up entirely and simply throw this film into the pinball machine of art-house clich√©, and what a score he achieves. In particular; slow motion violence coupled with classical music. I have more than a sneaking suspicion that the director is a big fan of ""A Clockwork Orange"" and especially the scenes of shockingly base violence coupled with classical music. If your favourite thing in the whole world is the sight of violence in slow motion backed by classical music then this is your lucky day - you are going to be in ecstacy watching this film. Sadly no-one ever seems to have explained to the director that watching violence is like watching porn; thrilling for the first ten minutes, boring for the next five minutes, before settling in to a depressing soul-crushing grind for all time thereafter.Every character is eminently unlikeable (whichever ""side"" you pick, both display shocking cruelty to animals, which for me is a massive red line), the story is exceptionally weak - the premise on which society ""breaks down"" is utterly pathetic. The whole trick of art- house film is to be able to create surreal metaphors which are cleverly interpreted observations on real life; this film can add itself to the list of wannabe art-house, simply scattering meaningless surreal imagery around with apparently no meaning or significance whatsoever. If you ever find yourself talking to the director and he mentions that he is planning on making another film, please do us all a favour and suggest that he find the nearest 40- storey high-rise block and throw himself off of the top of it."
" High concept, low returns
",2017-07-11 00:00:00,5,"Ever since Tom Hiddleston became an evil Norse god he can do no wrong in many people's eyes (that's a nod to 'Thor' in case you have no idea what I mean by that). In any case, besides ‚Äì allegedly ‚Äì dating Taylor Swift for about five minutes, he's pretty popular right about now. Therefore, a high concept arty piece, brimming with social commentary and with him taking centre stage must be worth a watch, right? Sorry Tom.Now, I like to think that I'm no stranger to the slightly more 'abstract' films. I don't just want to see endless car chases or Transformers movies. I loved 'A Clockwork Orange' and David Lynch's work. However, I just couldn't really get into this. It's based on a book of the same name that's apparently had a script associated with it that's been kicking around various productions companies for years. Now, it's only just been made, despite everything about it screaming that it's set in the seventies.As the title suggests, it's all based in and around a high rise block of flats. The opening scene shows that some sort of catastrophe has befallen the building and those left are living almost in feral conditions. Then we're flung a little further back in time and the film begins proper with us seeing the events which lead up to this social decay.And, Tom Hiddleston shows that he's not just a meanie with a horned helmet, he can also hold his own as a leading man. He does carry the film as the well-to-do tenant of one of the apartments. He's slightly aloof and disdainful of much of what goes on around him ‚Äì almost carrying himself a little like Patrick Bateman from 'American Psycho,' but never without sinking into quite such a chainsaw-wielding maniac. However, just because he's not trying to feed stray cats to cash machines, doesn't mean there isn't a healthy (or rather Unhealthy!) helping of s3x and violence. In fact¬Ö that's really all the film is.It's clear that the film has something to say about society and the way we lived. But it seems to get stuck in a bit of a senseless loop where gratuitous violence is all that's on offer. And, once you've seen one stylised fist fight (or worse!) then you probably don't want to see one in the very next scene as well. Perhaps if this film had been released in the seventies when such sights were a novelty in cinema and would therefore generate enough 'shock' with the public to make it stand out then it might have got a greater following. However, despite the decadent setting and the stylish way it's all filmed, there's not really an awful lot here to see. Yes, fans of Tom himself should enjoy it more than most, but it still feels like an empty Clockwork Orange clone that's been lost in time all these years and has missed its window where it would have been popular.I really wanted to like this and stuck with it hoping that it would finally change pace and pick itself up. However, it just repeats the same cycle over and over again and whatever message it thought it was trying to say gets lost along the way. Probably would have worked better as an art house piece that ran for between 20-30 minutes. It looks nice, but feels hollow. Wait¬Ö is that what it's trying to say about life?"
" A failure on every floor
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,2,"The question intriguing me after watching High Rise wasn't whether it had sufficiently excoriated the class system, as the writer and director seem to have hoped it would, but whether they had understood Ballard's remarkable book at all. Clumsily, almost as an afterthought, the film closes (and it's not a spoiler to say this) with a cheap political shot against 'capitalism'. How very 'Spitting Image'. But Ballard was better and smarter than that. The societal collapse he was describing was just as much a feature of socialist, fascist or communist societies. His Swiftian vision of mankind wasn't restricted to the fashionable political fetishes of the day but to man himself. An even greater irony is that the failure of the High Rise project stems from the fact that it was a planned project at all - which hardly bangs the drum for the sort of social re-engineering, statism and enforced egalitarianism the film makers seem to be suggesting would be preferable. Indeed, the supermarket stocked with nothing but unbranded products called to mind the Soviet Union rather more than Walmart, and it is strange that the director didn't realise this.It's hard to ignore the heavy-handed sixth form political wallpaper but even if one can, the film is still a weak average. Tom Hiddleston is as detached and android like as Ballard's Laing has to be, though one wonders if he has anything else to him as this does appear to be his stock in trade performance, but the rest of the cast hams and camps it up adequately. The orgies, however, get as tiring and passionless for the viewer as they must have been for the participants, and even the choreographed violence lacks any of the dangerously seductive grace of Kubrick's Clockwork Orange - they are simply unpleasant but not even shocking.It is hard to make a film suggesting a dystopian future by setting it in a past which, clearly, those who made it were too young to have experienced. On balance, I wish they had left it someone else."
" High on weirdness, and something that doesn't ultimately rise to the occasion
",2017-05-30 00:00:00,6,"I was quite intrigued, about how this film would come across. Yes, it's an original watch and inventively clever, but actually, especially through it's trashy moments, it becomes all too much. Through all it's madness, there is a underlying paper thin/thriller type of plot. An original indeed, but really, a movie with nowhere to go, so for it's near two hours, we have to endure crazier and crazier moments, some that had me on the verge of just turning off, as just finding it reaching the depths of stupidity, like say in Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. But the film is magnetizing, and addictively a re watch with Hiddleston, the perfect lead. There's really something about this dude. He's a doctor, or so we believe, who we find at the start, living in the trashy depths of this swank British high rise apartment, where you have to earn living status, where we meet a vast selection of oddballs, that inhabit the building, divided into classes of people, from the upper class, ostensibly pompous assholes to the sickly poor. The whole complex is run by an aging, limping, Jeremy Irons. There are moments that will shock, ala: animal cruelty, which I totally abhorred and some moments that'll amuse, but this is one of those films that has to be seen once, while it won't cater to everyone's taste. Sienna Miller was very good as the sexy, seductive room mate, living upstairs from Hiddleston, while Luke Evans really stole the show, captivating, as a loser type/wannabe documentary filmmaker. The young over pregnant girl was cute and sweet. The young kid of high intellect, Mr Peabody and Sherman type with the frames, was the real movie stealer though. Yeah, the film does make it's points, about how there should be equality, but look beyond that, it's just madness, but somewhat addictive. Based on a novel by J.D Ballard who wrote the novel for Cronenberg's '97 cult hit, Crash, I must say I was disappointed for him to write something like this, as the story doesn't have same spark or nous, and wasn't electric, like that unforgotten hit, 20 years back."
" I'm befuddled and confused!
",2017-05-17 00:00:00,5,"This could have been so much better, I was sorely disappointed. I was left with so many questions, such as why did Dr. Laing never unpack his moving boxes? What happened to his co-worker who's MRI revealed something negative? Why did so many of the residents, including those on the upper floors, dress in the same dirty clothes, covered in blood, paint, etc.? Why the cruelty to dogs/animals? Why the sound of seagulls outside when it wasn't apparent the tower was anywhere near water? Why was it set in the 70's? The preview and reviews gave the indication it was in the future. Who was the birthday party and cake for; apparently Vicki- who's that? I found the dialogue terribly muffled at times, and the British accents didn't help. Felt I was missing something important at times and wished Amazon streaming provided option for subtitles.Many of the tenant relationships were hard to connect; hard to keep track of who was with whom.Many disturbing scenes left me wondering if we are to take this movie seriously or is it a satire? The weirdness reminded me of David Lynch and Terri Gilliam movies, many of which I enjoyed. But similar to this film, something you'd enjoy better if drunk or high.One of the redeeming qualities was seeing Tom Hiddleston nearly naked in several scenes.On that note, If you don't mind excessive sex, rape, violence and drug use then maybe this is for you. If not, steer clear."
" High society
",2017-05-13 00:00:00,4,"As I watched ""High-Rise"" I couldn't help wondering how they got the money for it. That must have been some pitch.I found the film buried deep in Foxtel Australia's Masterpiece Channel, but I'm beginning to think 'Masterpiece' is a destination for films that are impossible to categorise.A brief synopsis doesn't really prepare one for this film.A stressed-out doctor (Tom Hiddleston) buys an apartment in a supposedly state-of-the art, high-rise complex. He becomes embroiled in a warped ""Animal Farm"" existence with a class structure more or less dependent on what level of the tower block one lives on. Anarchy, and then chaos ensues as everyone parties maniacally while the facilities of the building begin to fall apart.Sound intriguing? Then you probably haven't seen the movie.It's like a mad cross between the films of Terry Gilliam and Peter Greenaway. There were sound pillars on which to construct ""High-Rise"" including likable actors: Tom Hiddleston with charm to spare as the doctor, and Jeremy Irons exuding gravitas as the architect who designed the building. Gorgeous Sienna Miller is also in it, but she is hard to recognise under dark hair, dirt and dried blood - I could never love a movie that treated her like that.The film has a classy score by Clint Mansell and brilliant special effects, but did J.G. Ballard's prose actually seem all that filmable? Brecht claimed that, ""Art is not a mirror to hold up to society, but a hammer with which to shape it"". All the hammer does in ""High-Rise"" is beat your brains out.And the smoking. I haven't seen that much cigarette smoking by actors this side of the millennium - it is truly breathtaking in more ways than one.""High-Rise"" not only failed to expand my cinematic horizons, but it also committed the cardinal sin for a film - it's tedious. At two hours, it takes a long time to make any point at all."
" Well-crafted, and unique
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,10,This movie is perfectly crafted and visually rich. Let yourself be absorbed by it's strange and brutal philosophy. It's brimming with impressive sequences and unforgettable moments that defy language. Probably the reason it frustrates people. If you want a movie that uses the power of film in the best way possible than this is the one for you. If you've ever been curious about Ballard or are a fan already then you'll love this.
" More of the same.
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,1,"Watched this directors other films, not really impressed with how he blatantly rips off other movies and somehow is hailed as amazing. His films just look good, but don't actually deliver anything new. Formulaic and boring. Waiting for it to finish so I could write this. Style over substance, ben wheatley is selling snake oil. Don't buy the hype."
" Is this the worst film I have watched right to the end?
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,2,So many good actors - I kept looking to see if their expressions were betraying what they really thought of it - they didn't. To start promisingly and accelerate downhill all they way is some achievement!Disjointed - often never appreciated why a scene was slotted in. Boring - same old dystopia. Lack of any subtlety - just lurched into senseless extreme violence.
" Great Idea but went downhill fast
",2017-03-30 00:00:00,2,"I watched the first 20 minutes or so and thought this was going to be a good film... everything was building towards a suspense type thriller with a successful doctor moving into a tower block with some 'interesting' neighbours. Sadly after that the film went downhill very fast descending into a series of bizarre clips featuring lots of random acts - scenes of sex, orgies, violence, drunken or drug fueled parties that were as another reviewer put it - like the ramblings of a mad man.This film had a great cast and was well filmed - it had all the hallmarks of a film i'd happily have given a 10/10 rating but in the end it was only a 2 for the first 20 minutes."
" A dystopia within a single tower block
",2017-03-30 00:00:00,8,"Dr Robert Laing moves into the twenty fifth storey of a concrete tower block and soon learns that there is a distinct hierarchy; those at the top rule the roost while those lower down are at the bottom of the pile. He is between the two groups. Early on there is some tension but that only escalates when the power fails. Their society rapidly collapses; tenants fight over the few remaining items in the building's supermarket and the two groups soon brutally turn against each other. Laing is in the middle but somehow seems to avoid most of the danger.This is a rather dark dystopian drama. Unlike most such films it isn't set in the future but in the mid '70s, the time the book it is based on was written. It nicely captures that era while not feeling dated. Tom Hiddleston does a fine job as Laing and Jeremy Irons impresses as the building's architect, who lives in the penthouse and imagines that he has built a vertical Utopia where problems are just a case of 'settling in'. Also notable are Sienna Miller, who plays the woman in the apartment above Laing's; Luke Evans as the bolshie Wilder and Peter Ferdinando, who plays the brutish Cosgrove. Once things start to go wrong there is a near constant sense of danger and there are moments of fairly shocking violence, some of a sexual nature. As is often the case when societies reach an end there is also a decadence among those at the top. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of the genre; just expect some distinctly uncomfortable moments."
" Incoherence incarnate
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,4,"This might just be the most incoherent movie I've ever seen. Nothing makes any sense. Things just happen but there's no real anticipation or causality behind it. At first I thought that maybe I just didn't get it but when I re-watched the movie with some friends they seemed equally confused.The entire movie can basically be summarized in 3 words: parties, fornication, and violence. All the characters do in this movie is throwing parties and sleeping around with one another. It should come to no surprise that things gradually escalate to the point of a total SNAFU.The entire premise of the movie makes absolutely no sense once you realize that none of the raping and bloodshed would have taken place if someone just picked up a phone and called the police. But apparently none of the protagonists were intelligent enough to conceive this idea. And don't forget that the tenants could've left at any time if they so desired. But apparently the possibility of getting raped and killed off is not reason enough to leave the building (sarcasm). Actually, now that I think about it I should probably give the movie a lower rating than I initially have."
" sometimes, one must jilt high fidelity to achieve some extraordinary, but HIGH-RISE obviously is not the case here
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,6,"It took exactly 40 years to actualize the screen transposition of J.G. Ballard's dystopian novel HIGH-RISE, which is published in 1975. UK maverick Ben Wheatley takes on the project, his fifth feature, with verve and brio on the face of that the story itself is more often than not, deemed unfilmable. An ideological fable corralling a mishmash of characters inside an august tower block, with its occupants easily compartment-ed into a social and ritual hierarchy commensurate with the altitude of their stories. On its top 40th floor, resides the architect of the building Anthony Royal (Irons) and his wife Ann (Hawes), approached only through an exclusive elevator and surrounded by a luxuriant rooftop garden, occasionally Ann will throw a lavish 18-century French costume party out of caprice, which our protagonist, Dr. Robert Laing (Hiddleston) is invited but his suited formality is bitingly derided by the hostess and company. Laine is a new tenant who occupies a room in the 25th floor, which denotes his status as a bridge between the upper and lower floors, indeed, he befriends an idle documentary maker Richard Wilder (Evans) and his preggy wife Helen (Moss, sports a British accent) who lives below and catches the attention of Charlotte (Miller), a voluptuous single-mother who lives just above him, before they take a roll in the hay, also he is the one who is invited by Mr. Royal himself to glance the view of the top, whereas for Wilder and his ilk, they don't even have a clue about what the architect looks like. Told from flashback, within three months, everything would descend into sheer anarchy, that's what unrelievedly en-trains in a fictive dystopian world, due to class stratification and its trimmings: uneven allocation of resources, miscarried privilege, ennui and debauchery. In a starkly impressive visual tack, Wheatley unleashes his faculties to maximally depict the ongoing strife, encounters and their ramifications with slickness (a music video feel of poshness, especially topped off by Portishead's cover of ABBA's S.O.S.) and confidence (slo-motions, pulsating tableaux and revealing compositions galore). But on a lesser note, the narrative never truly gels which renders the vociferous actions bluntly improbable and incoherent. It is just a matter of time for viewers to lose one's investment in its heterogeneous characters, carrying off their tussles, assassinations, dry-humpings and petulant decisions to a hyper-stylized genre pastiche which we have already seen, for example in Boon Jooh-ho's SNOWPIERCER (2013), with much more gusto and thrill. A can-do ensemble cast shouldn't be accountable for the film's own textual disarray as most of them are hobbled by the flimsy material at their disposal: Hiddleston is exploited as a jolly-good specimen, inhabits himself to Laine's suit fetish, gratuitous nudity and simulated romp with the same commitment; Sienna Miller, as gallant as she is, is given the short hand of a misogynous male- gaze, at one point she is mentioned by the tightness of her genitals, always a fair game to blame along other petticoat cohorts; but it is Luke Evans, upstages everyone else in his greasy wig and blood-tainted slap, gets off on Richard's insurrectionary vibe and having a field day. When the coda finally reveals the story takes place in Thatcher's era, its ripple effects can be wholeheartedly related to today's political weather, since it is always the same-old transgression stemming from the capitalistic structure, but tackling with an influential but un-cinematic fiction, one needs a much more tectonic re-imagination and re-structuring of its source material before indulging it with all the glitters, sometimes, one must jilt high fidelity to achieve some extraordinary, but HIGH-RISE obviously is not the case here."
" Felt longer than it actually was
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,5,"I have not read the book, which might have made a difference. the film gets points for being daring and creative; I liked the concept; I admire many of the actors; I'm OK with the allegorical elements. Nevertheless, while certain visuals and certain moments were striking, on the whole it didn't work. The societal breakdown (not a spoiler, since you can tell from the opening scene that's what we're in for) occurred far too quickly, then stayed at the same level for far too long. At times this became repetitive, which was boring. (I was surprised when I checked and found the whole movie was less than two hours long.) Perhaps because of an attempt to be faithful to the book, there were too many characters; I had trouble keeping track of them. On the other hand, there were lots of moments that were memorable, especially visually. If you loved the book, or if you're an aficionado of dystopian futures, you might like this film. But be prepared for long waits between the high points."
" Very Good Attempt To Bring Ballard's Dystopian Message Home
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,8,"Always interesting to read ""reviews"" of films-from-books done mostly by people who haven't read the book or don't really ""get"" the author. Just as I said about ""Last Exit To Brooklyn"", you'll have a hard time getting this into movie length and an even harder time getting an audience who hasn't read the book to follow along.Looks like that happened. A very tough book to make into a movie (as was ""Crash"", whose basic contention had to be forgotten..) but very close to the tenor of the book. I liked it. I also liked ""Crash"". I liked the books better. But both were valiant attempts to put some pretty-far-out concepts on screen, obviously not to the liking of the public judging by the ""reviews"" here. Then again, people walking out of a theater in mid--film is seen by some of us as an artistic triumph...we want you to be confronted, and to leave if you feel that's appropriate. Please continue to do so."
" High-Rise Fails to Translate It's Beloved Source Material Leaving a Confusing Mess on the Screen
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,3,"It's sometimes hard to watch movies based on famous books. It can lead to you feeling out of the loop if the movie makes in-jokes or if the material doesn't translate, it kills any chance you were going to read the book. I'm willing to take people at their word that this was a good book but I certainly didn't get that from watching this movie. I was open to it and when I didn't get it immediately, I waited for things to clear up. By the time that the 3/4 mark though I knew it was time to throw in the towel. If some people find this entertaining, good for them but I found this movie to be uneventful and pretentious.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* After a quick flash forward to the future (I'm not going to talk about that, it would give too much away) we are introduced to Dr. Thomas Laing (Tom Hiddleston). He's moving into the new high-rise apartment on the 26th floor. He's looking for a change and these ultra-modern buildings designed by Royal (Jeremy Irons) should be what he's looking for. He's a physiologist, he fits into the approximate middle class in the building. He makes friends with some of his neighbours including: Charlotte (Sienna Miller), Wilder (Luke Evans) and his wife Helen (Elizabeth Moss). He even hooks up with Charlotte. There is a strict hierarchy between the floors, you're only supposed to associate with people so far above or below you. He's invited up to meet Royal who he gets along with despite their income gap and some of the elitist things that Royal likes to say. Weird things start to happen though, the power starts to blink and tension grows between the tenants. It gets so bad that the situation becomes a powder-keg and when there's a suicide from an influential tenant, the situation escalates into a full blown dystopian state.I always start with the stuff I enjoyed when it comes to movies that I didn't like. High-Rise looks pretty good for the most part. The production design, the costuming and how they choose to shoot the environment is impressive. There's one scene near the end where they show you what it would look like through a kid's kaleidoscope that's pretty cool visually. I also liked some of the acting, I think Luke Evans stole the show. I'm used to him being very stoic but he really dives into this and he's pretty creepy. I'm also more impressed every time I see Sienna Miller. She was great in Live By Night and she's pretty decent here.I'm really not criticizing the source material, I just don't believe it translates to film. This movie desperately needed a narrator and some exposition to explain what was going on. There was almost no context and because the movie isn't based on a strong story, it's hard to determine what's going on. There's also not a lot of plot progression either and the movie is pretty ambiguous about the time that has elapsed which clouds things even more. I don't mind when the movie doesn't treat the audience like kids and relies on you to fill in the gaps but it was like the movie wanted to give me a test on a subject I had little to no experience with.If the movie wasn't going to go heavy on the plot, I wish it could have given me some characters I wanted to root for. We get so little information about Laing and he's so cold and emotionless, you can't get attached to him. Charlotte and Helen have very little personality and Royal and the other rich characters are just jerks. I actually liked Wilder best until he went completely off the rails.This wasn't the worst movie I've seen lately but it's pretty close. I didn't go into this movie wanting to hate it, I knew it would be on the artsy side but I could still appreciate it if it were good. It wasn't though and I can't recommend this to anyone besides fans of Ballar's work."
" Looks pretty but fails.
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,5,"Such a shame. This film is based on an old novel with a cult following. So yeah, the concept and story behind the film are completely solid and literally there for the taking. Plus the budget for the film looks like they took a ""sky is the limit"" approach. The acting talent involved are top-tier performers who look like they gave there all.. but I think the director must have bitten more than he could chew because what should have been epic was turned into a forgettable mess. The movie is about a futuristic mega-apartment complex with all the bells and whistles, ultimately leading people into insanity thanks to class warfare, trends and etc. The major malfunction with the film is that the insanity isn't sellable because all the tenants can escape into the outside world anytime they want. The book, from what Wikipedia tells me, slowly introduces the insanity. The movie pushes the fast forward button, at the cost of the film itself. At least I have a reason to read the novel, if not just to wash away the memories of this film... which is ironically forgettable so scratch that idea! Moving on."
" Good setup, all falls apart after that
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,4,"It seems that British director Ben Wheatley is making a habit of disappointing his viewers lately, me in particular. My favourite film of his is still his first movie, DOWN TERRACE, although I quite enjoyed KILL LIST. Everything else has been poor, particularly the arty nonsense of A FIELD IN ENGLAND and the crude humour of SIGHTSEERS. Next we have HIGH RISE, an adaptation of the J.G. Ballard novel, and Wheatley's biggest budget production to date.It starts off well. Wheatley has clearly developed as a director and has a good visual style. The first half of the film, the set up, is very interesting in its depiction of a dystopian future, a microcosm of society inside a single tower block. The supporting cast is interesting, with Jeremy Irons as the architect and James Purefoy criminally underutilised as a rich businessman. A shame about the overrated pretty boy Tom Hiddleston; immaculately dressed and spoken, the guy has zero charisma and is a hollow man in the centre of the film.What a pity, then, that the opening shock scenes are the best in the movie. When chaos eventually erupts, everything goes to hell. It all becomes samey and repetitive; chaos is very hard to shoot right, and Wheatley just isn't up to the job. You have to keep a single narrative strand for the viewer to watch through the madness, as Paul Greengrass did so well during the massacre scene in BLOODY Sunday and the riot scene in JASON BOURNE. Wheatley doesn't cut it. The main problem, though, is with Amy Jump, who just doesn't know how to create sympathetic characters and whose juvenile attempts at writing keep scuppering Wheatley's attempts to make movies. It's about time he got rid of her and gave himself a chance to shine."
" High-(p)R(a)ise
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,8,"The slick combination of contextual capriciousness and wayward symbolism gave me a serious cerebral hard-on. Another movie I couldn't possibly begin to dissect without falling into the bottomless pit of my own verbal excitement that could very well keep me glued to this computer for hours I can't really spare.Exciting project, fabulous acting, and a multifaceted message that comes across loud, clear and unfiltered. Jeremy Irons and Tom Hiddleston make for an impressive duo, elevating the directorial vision's dystopian glamour to mythical heights. Bracketed with Clint Mansell's tailored musical outfit, everything comes together in complete synergy to perfectly structure a movie about fundamental destruction.Minus two stars over a few snags relating some of the wooden side performances and organic flow issues at times -- but that's just me being stingy with my last two."
