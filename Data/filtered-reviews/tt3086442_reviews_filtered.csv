" Subtitled, but it doesn't matter.
",2021-04-07 00:00:00,7,"Movie is mostly visual. There's very little in-depth back and forth conversation to miss.. it's slow to develop, but it's telling the story., So sit back and enjoy the videography. Almost any frame could be Frozen and turned into a beautiful print."
" Haneke, but not that much.
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,6,"A film, which bothers and disturbs the audience, is successful in my opinion. This is how I consider it as a simple moviegoer. The film can speed up the heart rhythm of a person with wonderful images without tiring. There are possibilities in the story and they always keep the tension high. However, we feel that something was missing some time after the movie ended, due to a few blank spots."
" One of the most effective horror films of the decade.
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,9,"This was one of my favourite movies when I originally saw it - and it certainly still holds up.Definitely the pinnacle of effective slow burns, this movie does a great job at moving the pace along at an entertaining and effective rate, without it feeling like a drag.The twins do an incredible job in their respective roles; they are believable and have great chemistry (probably helped by the fact they are actually brothers). Susanne Wuest also does a brilliant job in her role, creating a truly creepy and confusing character.The overall theme of the movie is incredibly effective, and the tension continues throughout the whole runtime. The main plot was easy to understand and worked well; while the subplot was super interesting. Focusing on whether or not Lukas was alive, and what happened during 'the accident' was subtle and really well done. I picked up on little things during the second watch that made this subplot even more entertaining.I also highly appreciate the use of a subtle but well-chosen score, and a lack of jumpscares. The cinematography and direction are also second-to-none. Visually, this movie is perfect.I would HIGHLY recommend this one to anybody who wants a modern horror with extra substance and a genuine creepy feeling. You will not be disappointed."
" Wo ist die Mama?!?
",2021-02-18 00:00:00,8,"Goodnight Mummy is tough to call: It sets up the movie perfectly, builds tension very early on and is likewise tightly shot, with the twin brothers performing strong. Yet the film's second act lets it down. There are scenes that stretch so long, when ending does eventually hit, you would think it happened in an instant. This is a hard movie to sit through ultimately and it is a shame because it has so much potential."
" Gripping and vibrant story
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,5,"I found this film to be very predictable as I realized the twist 10 minutes into it. Predictability aside, this film still delivered a visually stunning, heart pounding story on the topic of grief and loss."
" Creepy as can be, but too slow paced to be as effective as it could have been.
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,7,"Creepy as can be, but too slow paced to be as effective as it could have been. So often with ""horror"" movies, the story will bear a very taut, tense 60 minutes...but it gets stretched to 85 or 90 to find a market (not a lot of places screening 60 minute movies). That is absolutely the case with this cold-as-ice creepy-fest.Watching GOODNIGHT MOMMY, I also felt ""only in Europe."" Or at least, ""not in the States."" Our movies would never let children be quite so blithely brutal. It's the story of twin boys (aged maybe 11-13?) who are home alone at their gorgeous home in the country (Austria, it would seem). They play in the fields, explore caves, etc. Then one day, their mother comes home from the hospital. Her face is almost completely bandaged and the parts of her that do show are bruised and even bloody. The twins are instantly convinced that this woman is NOT their mother. At first, we just get to share their ""detective work"" on this woman, and begin to see things from their side. But they want to be convinced, and the things they begin to do to this woman in the name of getting to the truth are quite unsettling.But this is not the whole story. I won't spoil anything for you if I can, but rest assured that this ""is she or isn't she"" theme is far from all this film is exploring. You may not find everything that is revealed to be surprising, but the journey is still deeply unsettling. At times, the movie shows us almost nothing...we are left to imagine. And then at other times, it is startlingly graphic. So be prepared. It's mostly a quiet film (and disquieting), but not always ""polite.""But there are too many scenes of the twins simply looking at each other, as if silently deliberating. True, we've all heard that twins have their own special empathy (telepathy?), but that doesn't mean it makes for interesting viewing. And a few too many shots are repeated over and over. We see the twins hunkered down over ""mom"", wearing their white strap t-shirts (as seen on the cover photo) simply way too many times.Some scenes are unusual and effective, such as the creepy game of ""20 questions"" the boys play with their mom. Others, like when the Red Cross volunteers stop by and are astonishingly pushy, strain credibility a bit too much.The film has an overall quite dark and oppressive mood. With the slow pace and general gray feeling, this is bit of a chore to get through. I watched with two other folks. All of us fans of creepy movies. One feel asleep just past mid-way. The other (and I) dosed briefly from time to time...but didn't seem to lose anything important. It simply needed to be tightened and shortened. I still recommend it if the basic plot sounds appealing or interesting. I did not consider it a waste of time at all. But if quiet, creepy films aren't your cup of tea...this will not suddenly change your mind. (Oh, and based on a couple of 1-star reviews here...yes, the film is in German with English subtitles. Sorry, you will actually have to read a bit! Most of us don't mind, but for those viewers who struggle to multi-task, be warned.)"
" Predictable Ending
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,7,"I have ADHD and even I noticed the fine details to quickly arrive to the very predictable ending. What really threw me off was the paranormal-looking scene when the mother was naked in the woods. What's that about? Anyway, it was a decent movie. The plot twist that everyone talks about just didn't blow my mind like The Others and The Sixth Sense were able to do brilliantly."
" Why Don't Psychological Horrors Explain Anything?
",2021-01-07 00:00:00,5,"I'm getting very tired with these kinds of movies. The slow-burn, mindscrew psychological movies that never bother to explain what's real and what's not.This movie is pretty much a poopy rip-off of A Tale of Two Sisters, but with a bunch of superfluous, random weird-out ""scares,"" that, while effective at first, mean absolutely nothing to the actual narrative. The ""twist"" in this movie is super obvious by about halfway through, and since it's the only thing the movie bothers to explain....it just left me feeling empty, like nothing I saw mattered. It's got great atmosphere, great acting, tons of tension...but so much of the movie is needlessly bizarre for no real reason, no real impact on the story.Please, horror writers...stop this dumb trend of mindscrew movies that don't make sense at all only to write it all off as an ""unreliable narrator."" It's lazy, cheap, done before, and most of all insulting. A shame since most of the movie is thoroughly engaging, but in the end a completely hollow, confusing, and derivative piece of overhyped nonsense that OF COURSE the hoity-toity, smarty-pants critics LOVED. Figures. This kind of movie is up there with postmodern self-referential slashers, cheap found-footage flicks, monsterless monster movies, and shaky gray Asian child ghost with long hair movies in the Top 5 least interesting modern subgenres of horror, and I certainly hope the genre returns to the former glory it had in the 70s and 80s."
" Goes from 0 to 100
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,9,"This movie looks tame. When you start watching it you're like ""okay this is doable"" and then you wonder what's going on. There's a lot of unseen elements. Then, the children tie the mother up to the bed and basically torture her and burn her alive. I am a high school student with an extremely high tolerance for horror and this movie was scarring. Would not recommend for anyone under 14 probably. Possibly older. I gave this 9 stars because it was extremely well done but this is NOT FOR EVERYBODY. It's graphic, realistic, violent, etc."
" No idea why the rating is so low
",2020-12-17 00:00:00,9,It borrows from the great legacy of Tale of Two Sisters and Funny Games. It is slow but the end churns it all together for you and blasts a fuse in your brain. The horror is real. It deserves more laurels in its hat.
" Great directing meets poor writing
",2020-11-28 00:00:00,3,"The cinematography, editing, pacing, and setting of this movie are all done very well. It does a great job building suspense and a decent job keeping the big reveal under wraps. Where this movie falls apart is its writing. Once the movie reveals that she was actually their mother the whole time, the entire logic of the build up falls apart. For instance;When they're playing Heads Up in the beginning, why doesn't the mother have any idea Elias is talking about her when he went into detailed specifics of her life and job?Why doesn't the mother know Lukas' favorite song?When she says she has brown contacts in the bathroom, why aren't they there?Why did she paint a fake birth mark on her face? Especially since she got reconstructive facial surgery to make her face more appealing on TVWhy ins't she spewing out facts that only she would know about them to prove she's their mom, i.e. their birthdays, favorite foods, specific childhood memories?Who the hell is the other lady in the picture, who looks like her twin, and why is nothing ever explained about her?Why does she all the sudden turn into an abusive tyrant who regularly hits her son and locks him in his room, among other things, when we're led to believe she was a nurturing and loving mother before the surgery?Then there's the ridiculous scene with the Red Cross where they just decide to walk in and around a strangers house without being invited in then wait there for an hour with a young boy alone. Building tension doesn't work if you have to throw away reality to achieve it. Then of course we have our obligatory dream sequence where Elias dreams of his mother walking into the woods and stripping naked, at which point her head just starts contorting all over the place. What does this have to do with anything, was it suppose to be scary because it's more funny than anything.Then there's the cat. When they find the cat it is in a cave of human bones. Why the hell are there human bones all over the cave and why is this never expanded on? Again they add something in to try to scare the audience that isn't scary, is never explained, and has nothing to do with the rest of the story. Then when Elias finds the cat dead he does what any normal kid would do, empty his terrarium of beetles, fill it with water, dump the cat in it, and leave it on the living room coffee table. Why does he do this? Who the hell knows but apparently the writers thought it was scary. And apparently the mother doesn't have the time to discard the dead cat floating on her coffee table in the next few days before she gets tied up.This movie is incredibly frustrating because it had so much potential that was ruined by writers who valued what they thought would be scary and over having an airtight script based in logic and reality."
" Yiorgos Lanthimos's school
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,6,Yiorgos Lanthimos's school. Obviously the directors of this movie are trying to follow his steps.
" Terrible movie
",2020-11-12 00:00:00,2,"The script goes out of its way to trick you into thinking the mother is a monster or so. Literally walking in the woods taking off her clothes and spinning her head like she was in the exorcist.But the entire movie spins in itself, to reveal a pointless twist. Like hahaha look how smart we are ahahaha the other boy doesn't exist.This really is a collection of borrowed ideas with average cinematography and a slow burn. The writing is terrible and ruins the entire piece.Mr script writer you gave away the twist in the first 5 minutes, it is not unexpected. And the red herrings you throw everywhere aren't clever enough or even realistic. This is complete nonsense.2/10 an insultingly bad script."
" Waste of time
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,1,"This might be my first comment ever on a movie, dont waste your time. Absolutely not horror, slow build up without any sort of resolution, predictable from the first 10 minutes, too many plot holes to count. PLEASE dont go into this with any hope of a decent movie. I only wish I could see what everyone else sees giving it so high of ratings"
" Boring with misleading premise
",2020-10-09 00:00:00,3,"I only watched the movie because of the high score on imdb and the movie's description, and I expected something different and something much better. I don't watch trailers before watching movies because often they contain spoilers but I watched the trailer later and I find it misleading. I expected more mystery and creepiness that would keep me at the edge of the seat throughout the duration of the film but that didn't happen. The main horror part of this film is torture so if you're into that you might like it better than I did, as I don't enjoy that type of horror at all. And as other reviewers mentioned - the plot ""twist"" is really easy to spot very early on. The scenery is nice, the kids and acting in general is good. I think this film would do much better if it was turned into drama."
" This lullaby isn't to bright.
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,9,"Throughout the coarse of the film, ""Goodnight Mommy"" transcends It's horror roots and reveals itself, truly, as an emotionally brutal drama."
" Amazing movie with a great plot twist
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,10,"I love movies with plot twists that make you want to watch more and more. Slow at first, interesting at the very half of the film. You won't regret watching it if you love psychological thrillers. Give it a try."
" A slow burning descent into madness (no pun intended)
",2020-09-01 00:00:00,7,"When a psychological horror film features kids, there is this immediate dread that they will be in danger somehow. And for a while it does seem that way - until the 30 minute mark. And things are turned completely on its head with gruelling, horrific results.When a twins' mum returns from the hospital after having plastic surgery, she begins to act strangely in ways that trouble them. But the twins are already troubled in their own way - and it's not until the very end that we realise how much.In the same vein as Raw, secrets are kept to make make the audience feel disorientated and willing to watch more. Only in this one, not everything is explained. Because the dialogue is limited and the family is cut off from everyone, much of the film is extremely vague. Though the directors did it intentionally to keep a sense of unease, there are things shown in the film that don't really make sense by the end. For example there is a sequence where the boys trudge through a catacomb next to their house. Where did those skulls come from?The directors admitted this film was primarily about miscommunication. And it does seem like they achieved it, although they did it to the audience as well. Whether it was intentional or not, I'm not sure."
" Funny Games
",2020-08-19 00:00:00,8,"Though it may be controversial this movie is more ""funny games"" to me than the actual Funny Games (1997). It contains more gore especially in the second half and the tension gets higher and higher. The end is predictable and the film gives hints along the way but that doesn't spoil the fun at all in my opinion."
" Why was the mole fake?
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,9,"I guess she played the game too long, left for surgery and some peace of mind and that inattention to the situation cause Elias to snap. Or did she let her doppelganger take her place in that miserable place? If it wasn't his Mom and that's why he set her ablaze, why then did Elias feel he found her finally, just like Lukas', in the end? Lukas died as a kid but because he's a twin, Lukas can grow as Elias does, but it's all wishful thinking because Elias is just a kid after all. I think the main takeaway is that the Mom needed to eat a pork chop, because she weighed as much as her preteen son. And I guess we're to think, because she's a vain woman, she kept beauty secrets from her son (mole, contact) even as she was TORTURED."
" Good but precdictable
",2020-06-25 00:00:00,6,I saw a full review in filmroll channel..i understand the story because it is a minimalism movie just 3 characters a mom and two sons...it is a physcological thriller with climax twist but it mostly predictable.two sons trying to prove that their mom is not a real one after she came from operation..
" It keeps your attention
",2020-06-18 00:00:00,6,It keeps your attention but moves very slowly. Nice kicker ending.
" Painfully slow
",2020-06-18 00:00:00,3,"It was boring. I kept falling asleep. The movie took so long to get to the point that by the time the climax did happen, I was over it LOL.The child obviously has psychological issues and never got treatment for what happened in the movie. And as a result bad things happen. The end. Literally wasted my time."
" Slow, but dark movie with a good twist at the end
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,7,"This whole movie was an experience and I enjoyed it very much from the acting to the plot. The first half of the movie is a nice slow pace which grabs your attention and curiosity with the twisted imagery and it's beautiful cinematography. Despite the ambiguity in the plot and lack of character development, I enjoyed this film in its entirety."
" Extremly boring and predictable
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,2,"I think this was recommended by americans that automatically assume a foreign film with subtitles is intelligent and artistic. It's not. In the first 10 minutes I caught the ""big"" twist. Kept waiting for something creepy to happen. Waste of my evening."
" it's a cool creepy movit that with very little keeps us interested
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,7,"Now there might have here some plotholes to explore. Certain things seem to happen just to trick the viewers but they might not have a logical explanation. I also have to say the ending was a bit predictable since all the previous signs indicate what happens and we can gather most of the pieces easily.however there's a whole bunch of positives. The movie is well shot. The cinematography is cool. The pace while slow keeps us always engaged since it has small quirky things going on and elements to add. I didn't find this movie boring at all and we're talking about something based almost only in one place and 99% of the time with three characters. that's an accomplishment in my book.I also liked the characters and how they reveal information about them. the mother has depth and the kids are also interesting. The movie can create a creepy atmosphere with very little: with light, with some of the dialogues and a lot with silence. I feel here the silence makes an important part for us to be creped out by this. Then it goes into a different direction and i really thought that was well made.We're having a bunch of ""atmospheric horror films"" in recent times. Some people need to understand that when they see ""horrror"" as a category in a movie that won't imply the usual type of horror with jump scares or plenty of kills. I absolutely love slashers. Supernatural movies not that much, but some are very good. This is neither. It comes from someone with a vision about what they wanted to talk (in that sense not very different from ari aster's hereditary) and has an artsy vibe that i did enjoy.while i don't think is a great piece because of some plot points and predictability i still think is a well made movie that's interesting to follow. And actually more entertaining that what i was expecting. it also has some scary crepy moments. I did enjoy it."
" Slow burn to a bonfire
",2020-05-21 00:00:00,7,"All these people saying ""i guessed the plot at 5 minutes / 13 minutes / 20 minutes"".... what are you, 10 years old?? Smh. Bunch of weirdos.Not super predictable though I did guess the punchline a few MINUTES before the reveal at the very end. The movie was slow but not so slow that I was pondering the plot twist the whole time. Maybe if I treated the viewing that way I might have beat their scores. I was too busy being mesmerized by the mood and suspense.Despite the cool mood, this slowly becomes a very emotional movie and really finds its heart at the end. Points for that. Hard to do. The twins are sensational."
" Irritating torture porn
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,3,"The imagined/ghost twin plot twist was so obvious, I called it within the first 5 minutes and only kept getting confirmed when the mom and other adult characters would only interact with one twin the entire movie. The mom only talks to one twin, only gives a drink to one twin, etc. And later she tells him she could pretend his brother is alive and make two plates but we would've been way more thrown had the mother done that from the beginning and interacted with both twins, and then later revealed that she has been putting in the extra effort and playing along for her living son's comfort. This movie tried way too hard to be deep."
" Like a mediocre short movie made into a feature film
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,3,"First of all the good things. The movie looks good. The camera did some solid work here. Also the cinematography is partly very nice and thought through. You can see a lot of attempts to create symmetry - which however doesn't always work perfectly and therefore looks a little poor.The acting of the kids is also solid as well as of the mother.The really weak points start with the book and are probably also caused by bad directing. The plot twist is totally foreseeable latest after the fifth minute of the movie. There are way too many hints which point you into the direction of the ""shocking"" end. Even before the exposition comes to an end they basically give it all away.What follows is an endless stream of scenes which mostly seem totally unnecessary and misplaced. None of them give you any new information and are just there to establish the mood over and over again. - We really got it the first time..... Regarding this issue throughout the whole film you never loose the feeling that this movie was originally meant to become a short of 20 mins or so.This becomes even more visible when you see that the characters have no development at all. Or better said the development is supposed to be there but the director completely misses the chance to tell this story.The characters are about as emotional as an open fridge. This causes you to not care at all about what happens to them.Before the whole misery of 95 mins comes to an end, the book gets into some very constructed scenes about a red cross ringing at the door. This however has more of an unwanted comedic vide to it.All in all this kind of a story has been told so many times that the director and the author should have taken a much more sensitive approach to not give everything away. But hammering information in your face over the whole 95 minutes makes even the dullest person see through the ""secret"" of the two boys. Long before we even get halfway through the film."
" Awesome!
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,8,Creepy gets under your skin. A gem! Great acting and loved this movie.
" Great story and average screenplay
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,6,"It clearly seems they rushed while writing, despite of the good story the screenplay seems bore at some places, cinematography and use of light was brilliant."
" Unbelievable...
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,7,"""Goodnight Mommy - Ich seh ich seh"" is a Thriller - Horror movie in which we watch a mother with her twin boys staying in their new country house after the mother had a face changing cosmetic surgery. The twin boys soon starting to question their mother believing that she is not their mother and everything will change.I have to admit that I did not know what to expect from this movie since I had only watched its trailer and seemed just an interesting horror movie. It was a big surprise for me since after watching it I was left speechless. I liked it very much because it had an interesting plot with much of suspense and some unbelievable scenes that I will remember for a long time. The direction which was made by both Severin Fiala and Veronika Franz, was simply outstanding and I believe that they both did an excellent job because they presented very well not only the problems that the family had but also how these affected the children and what result they had. I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie because it is the definition of a psychological horror movie and I am sure that you will enjoy it very much. Finally, if you are a fan of horror movies and you are sick of watching poor horror movies, just watch this one because I am sure that you will love it."
" Needed some editing, otherwise a solid creepy n poignant tale.
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,7,"Inspite of being a lil slow paced, the film is not boring.
The initial scenes contain impressive photography. The locations n scenery makes u forget about the pace. The twist has been done in Asian n other horror films n hence predictable but the best part is the creepiness, the isolation n the descent into madness.
Better than The Lodge."
" The perfect psychological horror movie
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,10,"This movie is more unsetteling than scary. If you like to think, this movie is for you. Goodnight mommy doesn't tell you anything about the truth. You have to think for yourself. The characters are perfect and the actors does an amazing job. WORTH WATCHING. Btw, the movie being austrian doesn't ruin the movie at all! They dont talk that much. And i personally like it that way. Makes it more unsetteling :)"
" Way too predictable...
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,4,"I hadn't heard about this 2014 German horror movie titled ""Goodnight Mommy"" (aka ""Ich Seh Ich Seh"", odd official English title, as that actually means ""I See I See""). All I knew about this movie was that it was a German horror movie, and it being a horror was essentially enough to have my interest. I don't mind watching foreign movies, so that was not a hindrance to me.Actually while the movie definitely is watchable and it was nice to have a horror movie that didn't rely on jump-scares and cheap tricks, then the storyline in ""Ich Seh Ich Seh"" was just way too predictable. I had guessed it well before halfway through the movie. And it was a shame that it was so predictable, because directors Severin Fiala and Veronika Franz were definitely on the right track with this movie.It should be said that the cast, while being a very small number of people, were doing great jobs with their given roles and characters. Lukas Schwarz and Elias Schwarz were quite good in their roles, though I find it odd that they were using their real names in the movie. And Susanne Wuest, playing the mother, was definitely very well cast for the role, because her performance was really good.It was a refreshing thing with the horror movie as it was, but just a shame that the storyline was so generic and predictable. It made the movie lose a lot of points in my book.My rating of ""Ich Seh Ich Seh"" lands and settles on a less than mediocre four out of ten stars. This movie is definitely good for entry level introductions to the horror genre, but for a life-long horror veteran such as myself, then it just didn't have the ingredients where it mattered the most."
" NICE.
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,7,"What a shocking film, the plot was fairly easy to guess but didn't ruin the experience at all."
" Very Original. Don't read the spoilers, you'll ruin a good movie watching experience.
",2020-03-27 00:00:00,8,"Some smarty pants people want to run the film down while making themselves look sooooo smart because they ""got"" the movie's secret as early as the opening credits. Uh huh. Right.
Well, don't pay attention to them because it's secret isn't given up easily. A really good movie that starts with one mystery, and by the end makes you realize you've been watching another. Then you ask ""Wait, what clues did I miss?"" I watched it twice just to see how it was done."
" Sorry, what was that!!!!
",2020-03-13 00:00:00,1,"Do you call this a movie!, it's so silly and predictable!, I will never depend on reviews and rating anymore!!"
" No payoff
",2020-03-12 00:00:00,5,"The twist is SO predictable that I caught it in the first 13 minutes. Was that intentional?Anyway, talk about a disappointment. The first 40 minutes were pretty good. I was very interested to see where they were going to go with the plot. Slow moving plots are fine if it's worth it. But it just goes down hill from there, and without any payoff. And if you already caught on to the twist then it's a little boring.I feel like they made a list of common horror troupes and just ticked things off as they were filming. I gave it a five because I liked how the film was done, and I really was interested for a good portion of the film, but at the hour mark I lost interest because it just wasn't going anywhere by that point."
" Very creepy and unexpected
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,10,"The movie does a great job of setting up a story that makes you believe you know where it's going, but it changes dramatically and has some extremely well written twists, which if you pay attention well enough you may be able to notice as the direction and acting of both kids was excelent. Without giving too much away I recommend this film to any horror film fan looking for something creepy and different"
" Haunting Film of Madness and Grief
",2020-02-26 00:00:00,8,"This was a movie that I remember first hearing about right around the time that I got into listening to podcasts. It's been a few years, but I lucked out that the Gateway Film Center was showing this movie due to the writers and directors, Severin Fiala and Veronika Franz's new film, The Lodge, was being released. My girlfriend Jaime shocked me, as she's pretty new into the genre, stating that she had seen this. I told her my plan to watch this in the theater and she elected to join me as well. The synopsis here is twin boys move to a new home with their mother after she has face changing cosmetic surgery, but under her bandages is someone the children don't recognize.We start this off seeing a clip for an older movie as children along with a woman is singing goodnight. It then takes us to seeing two boys, Lukas (Lukas Schwarz) and Elias (Elias Schwarz) as they're playing in a cornfield, a lake and other places outside. When they return home, their Mother (Suanne Wuest) is home. She has undergone cosmetic surgery and is in bandages. She lays down the new rules that she needs to recover and needs her rest. This includes them needing to knock on her door before entering, to be quiet, not let anyone in and not to bring new pets into the house.Of course, these boys violate all of these rules. They're suspicious of this woman that claims to be their mother. They're looking into figuring out who she is and what happened to their real mother. She isn't very nice to them either, to the point where she seems to be completely ignoring Lukas.Things take a pretty dark turn when they're fed up with her and terrified of some of things that she does to them. They take some drastic measures to get the answers they're looking for. The real question becomes though, is this woman their mother or is there something wrong with these boys?Now I wanted to go a bit lighter on the recap here as there's not a lot in the way of story. I was reading up on some trivia after getting home from seeing this and learned that there really wasn't a script. I'm actually slightly surprised that is the case with how well this movie really does work to not have one. I guess it does make sense that they probably came up with what they needed to get across with each scene and that it was shot in chronological order.There's a lot to delve into this movie, despite the story not being that complex. I'm going to have a spoiler section at the end of this so I won't go too deep here if you haven't seen this yet. These two boys though are quite intriguing. They're actually twins and I think that does add a lot to their performance. We are also seeing this from mostly their point of view, which does make me question if some of things that we're seeing is really happening or they think these events are. I do find it creepy that they keep cockroaches as pets. Also I feel bad for the punishment that the mother hands down. What she does to Elias is pretty traumatic ones done and Lukas is pretty much ignored.That is something I want to delve into, the boys not recognizing their mother. She has a nose job done so she's in bandages I would say for the first half of this movie. It does make sense that they would think she's someone else. The medication she is on and she is quite moody during her recovery really does seem to add to that. On top, there's a video of her with different color eyes. She points out that is due to contacts, which is logical. There's also an interesting scene early on when they're playing a guessing game and the mother can't get the answer which to be honest, is genius for the name she is given. It really doesn't prove anything though.If I did have an issue, I would say that this does run a bit too long. I like the idea they're working with and this film had me cringing during the climax. There is a just a bit early in the second act that really lost me for a stretch. I think it does get a bit repetitive and where not having a full script really does hurt. It is interesting to see how this writer/director team corrects it for their next film though for sure. I do like where it ends up and the possible implications of what we get to see at the end.Something that I did really enjoy though was the acting. These two boys aren't great, but there's something creepy about them. I do think that in part of that is the fact that they are twins. They're also so convinced that this can't be their mother that they really do descend into madness through frustration to prove it. Building on that, I did state earlier the punishments they're given really don't help either. Wuest did really well and I feel quite bad for her as to what happens. She is kind of to blame which I'll go over in the spoilers, but she doesn't deserve what happens. The rest of the cast is fine for what is needed in rounding this out.That would take me to the effects, which we don't get a lot. The ones we do though are pretty brutally realistic looking to be honest. There are a couple of scenes with super glue that had me cringing. On top of that the blood looks quite real. You can see they did this with practical effects and it works much better than using CGI. I think there's a bit when it comes to things with fire, but it doesn't linger long enough for me to really critique that, which is strategic. The cinematography was also really good and that helps a movie like this.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack. I did notice for long stretches there isn't one. I think that is effective in building some of the awkwardness there. We do get some string style music though as well that really does help to build tension. This movie had my anxiety going though when things get crazy and the score does help there.Now with that said, I really liked this movie and I'm glad that I finally saw it. I think this really has some interesting aspects that it is exploring. We get a descent into madness and mistrust through that. I think the acting really helps to bring that to life. The effects made me cringe with the realism and I think the soundtrack really did fit for what they needed in helping to build tension or the lack of one at times to help that uneasy feeling as well. If I did have an issue, I think this movie runs a bit long to be honest. Not enough to run it, as it had me hooked from the middle on for sure. My rating of this would be a good movie and would recommend giving this a viewing. There's a stretch that I'm not sure non-horror fans would be able to handle, but if you can get through that, I think this is an intriguing little film.My Rating: 8/10SPOILERSTo get right into this, we see that very early on Elias is given a drink from his mother. This is really within the first 10 minutes of the movie. Lukas tells Elias to let her know that he wants a drink as well. She tells him that Lukas needs to ask her if he wants something. We get little things like this throughout the movie as it turns out that Lukas is dead. I think the acting does really well in having the mother only addressing one of them and they strategically hide this. I will admit that Jaime somewhat spoiled this by accident at breakfast, but what she said didn't give it away. I did figure it out and pieced together what she said about halfway through this movie.I do think that Elias does have some issue though in the punishment his mother gave him. She did entertain the idea that he was talking to his brother and it is mentally handicapping him when she changes this and punishes him. Due to that, Elias with imaginary Lukas punishes her thinking that this different woman is not their actual mother. I think this works as it layers all three of this characters to the point where you feel bad for all of them, but also hate them for things that they're doing. Regardless, the mother didn't deserve what happened to her even if I don't agree with what she was doing to Elias to get him to move on."
" Wow!
",2020-02-01 00:00:00,10,"An amazingly creepy movie with dark violence and a huge twist at the end!
Highly recommended"
" Slow and unexciting
",2020-01-29 00:00:00,5,"The synopsis for the movie said the mother had reconstructive surgery but I'm pretty sure she just had plastic surgery. The mother seems to have no personality at all. The twins tie her up and she doesn't say anything that would verify that she is the mother, like ""don't you remember when we did this and when we did that?""
The kids find a cat in among something like a tomb full of human bones, and they collect bugs. Everything is so slow paced. I didn't figure out the twist like everyone else did- either it's my age or it just wasn't worth pondering. The ending ruined it. Not bad if you're bored and just want to pass the time but I wouldn't recommend it."
" 4 Words: I Don't Get It.
",2020-01-18 00:00:00,6,"It's certainly enough to keep your attention and keeps you guessing. Unfortunately, you're still guessing long after the movie's over."
" Slow but nice twist
",2020-01-16 00:00:00,4,This movie had a very similar plot to I see dead people with Bruce Willis. While the acting was a little bit slow the dialogue very limited I think the two boys and the female actress did well to hold the story together. I did find at times me falling asleep however midway through the movie it did become quite intriguing. It's not until the very end we start to realise what is going on and you look back at specific scenes and noticed that there were hints along the way. A slow movie but an interesting twist that's been done again and again another movies.
" Interesting adaptation of 1970's movie, i'm thinking...
",2020-01-07 00:00:00,8,"By the appearance of the actors, as well, they chose, it really seems to be an adaptation of this old movie and not just a story that has been done before. I don't want to mention the other movie to give anything away though. It is very well acted by all the main characters and interesting to see how they handled each scene due to what the movie was about. I recommend the best way to watch this, is going in cold, because it really is a well done psychological thriller driven, atmospheric movie."
" Boring remake story
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,5,"The movie could have been much better and with higher expectations. It's the same story as the Korean movie ""The tale of two sisters"" but as soon as it is a low budget film it lacks in inspiration. We easily figure out how it's gonna end from the first 10 minutes and the creepy scenes can't thrill us that much. A good try for a peculiar movie but for me it's a mediocre one."
" Go in knowing nothing about this film
",2019-12-19 00:00:00,9,I had not seen this timely mostly because I like to do other things when I have movies on and this required full attention with subtitles. It takes a pretty disturbing twist and is very hard to watch. I have to admit I missed all the signs of where it was ultimately going until it arrived and then it was all apparent. Very sad tale but also very disturbing and chilling. Well done.
" Can you see me now?
",2019-10-31 00:00:00,9,"This is one hell of a slow burning horror. And one that is not really about a twist, though for those who are oblivious the twist might work too. But it goes beyond that. Most will be able to see through it (no pun intended). Still the structure and editing of the whole thing is eerie to say the least.And the acting works out too. I do have issues with acting in German cinema, but apart from this being Austrian (German speaking), this is more than rock solid. The three main characters all do their best work and convey the emotions necessary to move on the story. A story or string that may seem quite stretched but works in the confinements of the movie. Psychology and all included this really gives you an insight into crazy"
" And Don't Let the Bugs Bite!
",2019-10-05 00:00:00,8,"Ironically, the first two-thirds of this could put ANY mother to sleep.Wow, this is slow. Well, for the bulk of the run-time and it's probably the least subtle film I've seen with hardly ANY movie exposition. You literally spend over an hour putting the fewest of pieces together to get the story line. Well, not much more than this synopsis:Two young, twin boys play a ton at an isolated luxurious home, while their mom is attempting to rest and recuperate with what appears to be plastic surgery on her face. She doesn't seem to be in a good mood - ever, and takes most of her anger out on one of brothers by giving him the silent treatment. This does not sit well with the remaining twin.That's the gist for over an hour or so. Then the movie, for me, begins. The boys suspect something's not right with the title character and will pretty much go to any length to get to the bottom of the mystery of their Mummy! I mean...well...If not for that last third, I was wondering how this was considered horror or even a good movie. While I'm not a slow-burn film fan for the most part, oddly this movie didn't bother me too much. Sure, I would've like a little more WHAT-THE-HECK is going on explanations, but I was okay with it. That last act was so good, rich and tied it all together so nicely, it bumped up my opinion fairly high.I've heard so little of this and always wanted to see it. Now, a repeat viewing - probably not, but I am glad I finally saw it and glad that ending truly made this film worthwhile. Highly recommended.***Final thoughts: Admittedly, I cheated. I felt I had a 95% grasp on the meaning of the film by the movie's end, but I still went to a couple YouTube videos where they broke down the film's spoilers and deeper meanings, à la ""ending explained,"" anyways. I say I cheated because I generally won't watch or read any review on a movie I just watched until I complete my own review so that not to influence my own opinion. Luckily, I was right with my interpretation, they didn't alter my perspective and they even taught me more about the motivations and meanings. Still, I'd rather have my review fresh from any exterior opinions."
" Not sure about this one
",2019-09-18 00:00:00,5,"Obviously well liked by users, I feel tentative in criticizing it. Yet, I was not impressed. Mind you, I guessed what it was about after a few minutes only. In fact, the film is telling a story we've seen a few times before, the last one to my knowledge, in the 2009 ""The Uninvited"". It's a european movie, and therefore it's rather slow, well made nonetheless, well told and well shot, well played also by all protagonists. Was it then out of having guessed it, I don't know, but I was bored from the halfway point at least. It's not a great flick by any stretch of the imagination and, in my opinion, it's overscored here."
" A Slow Burn With Payoff
",2019-09-15 00:00:00,8,"I really liked this movie, which I think says a fair bit since subtitles are hard for me to watch. It is a slow burn, but keeps up with the intense creepy atmosphere which maintains interest. I first want to say there are so many subgenres of horror, so to say that this isn't horror simply because it's not your cup of tea, is unfair. I also hate when reviewers say not to watch a movie and that it was a pointless waste of time, again because everyone has different tastes and enjoys their own styles of horror. I tend to like it all without discrimination, even though my preferences are gore, creature features, and jump scares. Now when movies get a bit artsy such as Mother! and Midsommar, I feel a little cheated at the end. Not my cup of tea, but obviously many people enjoy those as well. I always say give a movie a chance, don't listen to others. And if you're like me and look at reviews simply for explanations when confused, then stay tuned.
I'm not going to cover the synopsis as you can read it above and have probably seen it already if you're reading a review with spoilers.. So here's what happened.
1. Lucas is dead, he died in an accident and Elias has not accepted this and for the duration of the movie is the only one who can see and here him.
2. This is their mom! She was also in an accident and is bandaged up due reconstructive surgery. Why does she seem so off? Well she did lose one of her son's, and with the other son unable to let go, it is even harder on her.
3. Elias doesn't believe this is his mom, due to the surgery, pictures being missing (as their dad left after losing a son), and the mom's unwillingness to continue pretending Lucas is still alive. Elias's uses hispersonification of his brother to further prove that this may not be his mom. The nightmares you see Elias waking up from; the cockroaches inside the mom, the mom running into the woods naked with her head spinning all around, etc... are his additional justifications for not believing her.
4. In the end Elias burns his mom alive because he doesn't believe it was really his mom. Also she can't tell him what Lucas is doing because he's dead and not really there. You see the mom's ""spirit"" leave the house during the firefighter scene, at the far left in the back.
5. The mom and Lucas are both dead and Elias is running through the cornfield letting us know he is still alive and got out of the house. We then see that he adds the personification of his mom with the one of his brother and now believes they are truly all together as a happy family again. Elias is mentally broken and unstable.
Now for the questions left unanswered:
A) How did Lucas die and was he in the same accident as his mom? They never state what accident either of them were involved in. They allude to the mom possibly being burned in a fire as she is afraid of lighters or even possibly a car accident. We get hints that Lucas possibly drowned from an early scene where Elias is floating out in the lake and calling for Lucas, but Lucas never answers and we see bubbles comes up from under the water. Which would also explain why the mom in the end tells Elias that Lucas' death wasn't his fault, assuming they were out in the lake together when. It happened.
B) Why doesn't the mom know her boys favorite song? And why would she have worn colored contacts, that the boys wouldn't have known about before the accident?
C) Why was their house listed for sale? This obviously alarms Elias as she hasn't mentioned anything, or is it that the they just bought/moved into the new house?
Well I hope this review helped for anyone that was confused on any aspects of the film. In my opinion this was a decent foreign indie film. Not sure if I would own it as part of my collection or even watch it again, unless someone else was interested. But I definitely feel it was worth the watch."
" Everything you've heard is true!
",2019-09-08 00:00:00,10,"Ever since it debuted at the Venice Film Festival, the Austrian import ""Goodnight Mommy"" has been building up a reputation as a horror exercise of the highest order-the kind of film that could supposedly reduce even the hardiest of observers into quivering blobs of jelly squirming in their seats, partly out of what is happening on the screen and partly out of fear of what might be coming just around the corner. As someone who has seen more than his fair share of such films that have failed to live up to their hype over the years, I tend to approach such things with more than a healthy dose of skepticism. In this particular case, the movie in question has more than lived up to its advanced word. In fact, co-filmmakers Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala have conjured an intelligently staged and executed creepfest that takes one of the most universally compelling of notions-the unbreakable bond that exists between a mother and her children-and approaches it in such a formally and narratively bleak manner that it makes the works of fellow countryman Michael Haneke seeming almost benign by comparison."
" Home invasion on a new level
",2019-09-04 00:00:00,10,"Goodnight Mommy or ""I see I see"" (translated 1:1 from the original title) is a super slow burning psychothriller. It´s not at all a horror movie in the classic sense. There are no monster or the intensive use of blood etc. It´s so subtle, so creepy, so eerie and esp in the 2nd half so disturbing that it´s sometimes hard to look at. However, you still look and are shocked by the awful things humans do. Fascinated by the intensity. You will feel sorry for each of the 3 characters. You won´t know who to believe, who to trust, who to support as things evolve in this emotional rollercoaster. The actors are believable in all what they do. I have seen big movie awards given to less convincing performances. A super clever thriller which plays with your emotions and believes as well as your mind. The ending - some found it predictable - I did not expect anything like that and LOVED the twist and reveal. To me one of the best psychological thriller I´ve seen !"
" Don't pay any attention to low ratings
",2019-08-29 00:00:00,9,"Most of low ratings are either due to the lack of jumpscares or due to the lack of people's observability. Almost no one understands that the woman is indeed not their mother, which is quite an unpredictable plot twist. Lucas' mother would indeed know his favourite song. Also the fact their mother had a look-alike friend/sister/cousin/whatever couldn't be coincidencial, just to feed Elias' suspicions.Also, their past is left to the viewer for various interpretations. Lucas might had died in the lake, or died to a fire, set by Elias (remember he wasn't allowed to carry a lighter in his room). Mother might be dead to the same ""accident"", or she might have left, unable to handle her son's death, where her friend (or whatever) comes to take her place, willing to help the father and Elias with their grief. Likewise, someone can answer ""why did the father leave"" and ""why did she get a plastic surgery"".Eitherway, my point is, 'speed watching' only results to one-dimensional reviews about a possibly good movie. Don't ruin yours and others' experience of the movie just cause you're bored of paying attention."
" Predictable.
",2019-08-26 00:00:00,3,"If you think you know where it's headed, you know where it's headed. This one's essentially just a German remake of 'The Uninvited' (2009). We've seen this idiotic lazy troupe in countless movies, not just horror. The sad thing is, I was into it for the first half. It's shot well and it drew me in initially, though the ""twist"" was pretty obvious from the start. Early on I kept thinking ""Ok, it's either gonna pull some Fight Club and one of the twins is imaginary, or the main character suffers from a Capgras delusion"". It was both. The ending completely ruined it, which was made all the more infuriating because the set-up was intriguing and they could've done more with it - the atmosphere was handled pretty decently, and it did have my attention until hit the fan - instead of just lazily phoning it in. It becomes a forgettable generic effort, which is a pain because it could've had potential."
" Not entirely predictable - *Spoilers*
",2019-08-19 00:00:00,7,"I did figure out the main part of the plot within the first few minutes and although the movie is slow moving, I wanted to fill in some of the blanks and wait to see how it ended. It's very reminiscent of ""The Other"", dead twin influences live twin to do bad things with horrific consequences. I would characterize it as a semi horror flick due to the sometimes subtle but cringe worthy things that were both imagined and really inflicted upon the mother. The end scene is left open to interpretation. Did Elias live and imagine both his mother and Lukas to be alive? Did Elias die along with his mother?"
" Horror? Meh. Decent psych-thriller w/boredom
",2019-08-19 00:00:00,5,"While the trailer really caught my attention, it gave away nearly all of the actual 'scares' of the film. Apart from those few scenes, there is a lot of slow moving development, and as beautiful as well choreographed as they may be, it still failed to deliver the spooky horror I was hoping for.This film delivers as a psychological thriller, but that isn't what I was looking for."
" A little bit disturbing movie
",2019-08-05 00:00:00,6,"In general it's a well done film, although the core idea isn't new as we see at the end, but director shouldn't have used that deal of violence and torturing and disturbing images."
" my notes
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,8,"Great movie with good directing, acting, cinematography, suspense, and creepiness. Not that scary overall, but had a great psychological aspect to it and kept me interested throughout. (2 viewings)
SPOILERS
some of the scenes with the brothers reminded me of growing up with Tarik so that was kind of cool. and I heard they improvised a lot of the scenes which added to us caring about the boys. I am guessing the burping scene and bath slapping scene were examples of that and I thought they were good additions to the movie. Those weren't really spoilers. I just wanted to make sure I put enough space between the first part of the review, and me saying: that twist owned me soooo bad. I did not expect it at all. It completely blindsided me. My focus was on the mother and what her deal was, if she was really their mother, or if something weird was going on. But the real ending. Wow wow wow. So good. Completely changed everything we saw before that. Certain things mean something completely different now that we know this fact. My entire perspective of the movie changed. It felt so good, I haven't been twisted like this in a long time. And I immediately started thinking about various things in the movie that point to the twist but are not obvious until you know. so good."
" VERY disappointing
",2019-06-10 00:00:00,5,"Based on the trailer and glowing reviews on this site, I expected a creepy and twisted story that would keep me on the edge of my seat. What I really got was a slow and predictable movie with no twists, no creepiness, and no payoff.The ""twist"" in this film is SO blatantly obvious that I don't even know if it was meant to be a twist. I've just seen other reviewers commenting on the ""twist"" but literally within the first 5 minutes everything becomes so transparent that you wonder if it's even worth watching. In the end, it really wasn't.It was also frustrating to me that we had no point of reference for what made the sons believe their mother is an imposter. Other than a couple of arguments, there was nothing that pointed to her being different to make them suspicious. As a viewer, how are we supposed to feel like this woman isn't really who she says she is, if we don't know what's changed about her? It's not a very long movie, they could have easily included a few extra scenes for some context.Unfortunately the premise of this movie was good but not executed well at all. The trailer made this movie look so creepy and unsettling. I've read countless articles listing ""Goodnight Mommy"" as one of the best horror films (and this is NOT horror in the slightest) of the last few years, so I was quite disappointed when the movie failed to summon any sense of dread or fear. I was unnerved near the end but that was just because the movie abruptly switches gears and subjects you to a half hour or so of torture. And then that insulting twist; I can't believe the director/writer doesn't think his viewers are intelligent enough to figure it out. Might as well have a blinking neon sign spelling it all out in every frame.I'm so mad I paid $4 to rent this."
" A true life lesson
",2019-05-24 00:00:00,1,"At first i failed to see the drama, the thrill, the horror. When i was done with the movie i finally got all three of them. The wasted time of my life. A true masterpiece of garbage."

I chose this movie to see only for its a twin subject but after finishing Im realising it's more than what I asked for.The climax get me travel back to every sequences that the twins were shown and gave me a slow heat mouth blow at my neck. God in the middle I thought it's a thrilling creepy movie made base of violence exposure but truly it's a love movie base of writing exposure. Applause for the writer!;

" JEER - (2 stars out of 10)
",2019-02-15 00:00:00,2,"The stage curtains open ...(Yawn) ... Oh, sorry. I guess I should wake up enough to review this movie. It almost put me to sleep. To say that ""Goodnight Mommy"" is controversial would be an understatement. And that is the only reason it gets 2 whole stars instead of the worst possible 1.Elias and Lukas, twin brothers, welcome their mother back home after reconstructive surgery to her face. It is a period of adjustment and regrowth, but as the two brothers soon find out, something is ""off"". Their mother, though recuperating, is not the same. In fact, they both begin to wonder if she is even their mother at all. The twin brothers are also not the same. There is definitely something ""off"" with them too. Their suspicious nature and her demeaning attitude takes them down a perilous road. One of those roads that once you pass the point of no return, there is no coming back, and no changing things.You have to be extremely patient to get through this one. The acting was good and there are some scenes that make you tilt your head to the side and utter a WTF - but other than that, I felt this movie was boring, boring, boring. There is a twist which is easily guessed pretty much from the get-go, and then they throw some red herrings your way, and another twist at the very end. I'm not going to sit here and give my thoughts on an explanation of the movie since (1) my reviews are always spoiler free, and (2) I really don't care.I would not recommend this movie. It's about a very sick, and twisted family. There is no redeeming quality to this film, no compassion felt for any of the characters and an ending that (in my opinion) has no payoff that's worth the wait. I'm tossing this one into the trash bin. Don't care if I ever see it, or hear about it again."
" Lacks motivation
",2019-02-05 00:00:00,6,"I found the setting, a post-modern house which seems to be located in the countryside utterly separated from any civilization, quite interesting. It elicits memories, whether real or manifested, of playing in the almost limitless, and more or less deserted, area as a child. The twin boys are interesting to watch, expressive even in silence. The mother is adequate, and portrays the vagueness required of the part.The story is light, however, and lacks motivation. Moving along lazily, one is not especially encouraged to continue watching. There is a twist near the end, but it is almost overshadowed by the torture aspect, which manifests itself during the interrogation portion of the film. Over all, I do not recommend if you are looking for a good scare."
" Unrealistic and sad
",2019-02-02 00:00:00,3,"The movie is about two boys who don't believe that their mother is their mother. A ridiculous premise from the get-go. True, she's wearing bandages but there any number of questions or memories that they could've put to her to confirm that she is their mother. Let alone grandparents, as Aunt, his uncles, as cousins, his teachers and on and on. And independent movie with a small budget should still not insult the intelligence of the audience. It becomes clear very early on that Lucas is a figment of Elias's imagination. Very early on the mother does not engage with Elias and since there is no reason given for her to ignore him we know that he is imaginative. The family looks well to do the country they live in looks well to do so it begs the question why Elias hasn't gone through counseling why hasn't the mother gone through counseling? Why is in social services coming by? It's just such a lazy story."
" Has a lot going for it until it undoes itself completely
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,5,"Plenty of technical merit here, and I even though they blatantly give up the 'twist' in the first several minutes like amateurs i was still very much into it's slow but very well edited pace. Until an unbelievable moment during the final stretch by the mother that had me laughing at her ridiculousness, and in the bad way, undoing all that came before it; and I realized the technically skillful buildup really led to nothing of substance whatsoever. Another critically overrated film as they decide to apparently ignore ridiculousness and narrative unbelievability for apparent art's sake. Similar to A Quiet Place and It Comes at Night but not nearly as aggregious. Overall, this was better than both combined."
" If you want an unexpected end, this is your film.

",2018-12-15 00:00:00,6,"WTF did I just watch? What was with that scene of the mom in the woods? If it weren't for that scene, I would say this was a pretty good movie. It seems like that scene was thrown in just to throw the viewer off. I really wanted to like this movie, but that scene just made the whole thing bizarre.

",2018-10-31 00:00:00,1,"I haven't sent a review in imdb for ages, but I came back just to confess my hate and disgust of this film. It's predictable in some ways and though I admit it's not a bad film, I hate it so much"
" the cockroach movie

" Very well made and Disturbing
",2018-09-04 00:00:00,7,"This movie is along the line of Funny games and We need to talk about Kevin. Dark, depressing, disturbing and haunting."
" Sick movie
",2018-09-01 00:00:00,1,I am really feeling sick after watching this movie. These kind of movies should not be allowed.
" Shocking and heartbreaking at the same time!
",2018-08-28 00:00:00,7,"This slow-paced movie is a mixture between psychological thriller and body horror. The latter was a bit much for me... but I am not a person to enjoy seeing gore and torture in a movie, so maybe it will be ok for others. I think it was toppled by the fact that children could do such things to their own mom.
What stands out and is completely heartbreaking, is the twist at the end and the ending itself. Which raises a lot of questions about handling children with mental disorders (in this case triggered by grief), about this particular mother's harsh strategy to handle it, about the lack of communication and the unhealthy, dark and cold environment in which there could have never been any healing. It's only ironic that it all goes down in flames."
" Wasted potential
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,5,"'Ich seh ich seh' had all the ingredients to be a great suspense movie. With a background reminding of some flicks like 'La piel que habito' or 'Les yeux sans visage', this potential gem of austrian cinema blasts off with a great start and mantains an equally great quality throughout the whole film. The slow pacing is a great fit for a light horror/suspense title, the directing is good enough and there's absolutely nothing wrong with any of the acting performances. Furthermore, it abides by suspense cinema's golden rule: keep it simple. With barely no dialogue it's up to the viewer to interprete the situations and the motivations of the characters.The problem is that the directing duo gives away too much, too early. From one of earliest scenes (""Lukas says he wants some juice too"") to the equally early confirmation (""I don't want you to talk to your brother anymore""), any mistery revolving the identity of the mother and her apparently bizarre behaviour vanishes into thin air, leaving nothing else but a disturbingly gruesome, nerve wracking experience that, while interesting to watch, lacks any of the suspense and the tension the films could have had, had Fiala and Franz managed to keep the viewer dissoriented for the majority of the trip.'Ich seh, ich seh' is still a good movie to watch, hard to swallow at times, gruesomely provoking. But the feeling that ultimately remains in the viewer is the frustration of having watched a movie that was polished into a diamond so fast it had enough time to return to its carbon form."
" Predictable yet very very disturbing
",2018-08-05 00:00:00,7,"This movie is almost the european equivalient of the Korean 'The Tale of Two Sisters'. While the Korean movie was much more complex, psycholgical horror. This one relies more on atmosphere. The absolutely lush yet somewhat surreal cinematography, the secluded house, the way the twins behave ( Who on earth collects those grotesque cockroaches ) creates an omnious atmosphere you never ever want to be a part of. However, one of the biggest drawbacks of the movie is, it gives away it's biggest twist right within the starting 10 minutes. For a seasoned moviegoer, it would be as easy as a cakewalk. You see it coming, you just hope you're wrong or it has some other trick up it's sleeve, but alas, it isn't so. But even then, towards the latter half, the movie makes a quick genre transformation to body horror, and it was disturbing. More so considering how innocuous and pure a mother-son relation is. 
Watch it with low expectations, without expecting a mother of a twist, and you might like it."
" Very good movie
",2018-07-22 00:00:00,8,Movie has graphic scenes- had to look away on a couple scenes. I knew what was going on saw a movie from the 70's very similar to this. Only problem i have is when she got him to cut her loose she throws the blanket and runs around in fear that doesnt make sense for her chatacter to be so frightened when earlier in the movie she jumped on him out of anger- this character was sick of his crap and would have clearly whooped his ass after being cut loose so thats the problem i have other than that i really loved the cinematography and the acting was good. Hopefully it wasnt intended to be a twist because i didnt see one
" Artsy, but not original
",2018-07-21 00:00:00,6,"This movie definitely has that artsy, slow paced, mellow feel to it, which i absolutely loved, you can clearly see the distinction between Hollywood and foreign films here, it was not overly dramatic as opposed to Hollywood films of this sort and had a good steady pace, which sadly got ruined a bit towards the end.The plot twist was really blatant, they had an excellent premise and in my opinion they should have just went with the original idea of this not being the real mother, instead they pulled the good old - dead sibling cliche and revealed it only at the end, but any experienced psychological horror fan had already gathered that ages before the reveal.All in all, the movie is not that bad, it is different, has great atmosphere and scenery, despite all taking place at one location. Do not go into this movie looking for horror, gore or fast paced action, this is a different kind of thriller, and not that bad of a watch, if you are tired from classic Hollywood horror and action scenes!"
" Great horror for the grown-up horror fan
",2018-05-31 00:00:00,7,This is a movie for grown up horror fans. This Czech film is violent and dark and features great performances and fantastic direction. You must watch this if you are remotely interested in the genre but beware- It is not for the faint hearted. But if you have the courage than give it a shot- you'll be surprised. (Great horror for the grown-up horror fan)
" Not a film for the squeamish or faint-hearted.
",2018-05-12 00:00:00,8,"Goodnight Mommy: Austrian film. Two boys play around a lakefront house, their mother returns after an accident, her face swathed in bandages. The boys begin to suspect she isn't really their mother. Relations between them and their mother worsen and they decide to tie her up and torture her to get her to prove that shes their mother. Not a film for the squeamish or faint-hearted. There is a twist to it which you may get early on or not until the end, but the evidence is there all along. 8/10."
" plausibility down the drain
",2018-05-01 00:00:00,5,"This one's thick with atmosphere. Unfortunately, I could never get over the basic premise that two young boys are left alone at home in a remote country house beside a lake and forest waiting for their divorced mother to come back from the hospital after a bad accident. The overall tone might be that of a dark and disturbing fairy tale, but at least the beginning should have been grounded in a little more realism. Otherwise, there is no real incentive to figure out the underlying psychological motivation of the characters and their interdependence. It feels like the directors had assembled all the creepy movie ingredients they could think of and then run out of their own ideas. The result is a demented shopping list where almost no cliché is left out. The bandage fetishism is a nice touch (a cross of Maria Beatty and Scott McGehee/ David Siegel), so is the art direction, although a bit obvious with the pictures of blurred silhouttes on the walls. The coackroaches, the candles, the children's games, the nursery rhymes, the bow and arrow, the pagan masks, the dark spaces, the dead cat, the bondage and torture, it's all too familiar and stripped of any real emotional attachement or narrative consequence. It's a clinical study of whatever they where trying to dissect, one that gets rather tiring about the half-time mark. The third act should have been the second act leaving room for a truly innovative story twist towards the end. Alas, that twist never comes and this viewer felt slightly frustrated when the credits started to roll."
" Absolutely horrifying!!
",2018-02-02 00:00:00,10,"So scary that I will never watch it again. But also really, really good. And even if youre some dumb american, who refuses to watch a foreign movie with english subtitles and you'd rather wait for the probably inevitable watered down american remake, I suggest you get your head out of your ass and watch a real horror movie, that will keep you up at night. The plot is that a mother comes home from the hopsital where she has reconstructive surgery done on her face after an accident. At home her twin sons awaits her. But apart from creepy bandages covering most of her face, shes acting strange. Very agressively. And she ignores one of her sons, pretending he isnt there. The other son, she scolds, drags violently around and hits him. The sons begin suspecting the woman isnt their mother but some impostor, pretending to be her. But nothing here is what it seems. The third act of the movie is almost unwatchable, but I recommend, watching it till the end, if you wanna find out what's really going on. This is true psychological horror for adults. Not wannabe horror based on jump scares and cgi like the shitty remake of IT. Or the ridiculous Conjuring movies, made for cash grabbing and nothing else. Right up there with Get Out, It Foillows and The Babadook."
" I saw boredom
",2018-01-29 00:00:00,4,"Unlike many I did not actually pick up the twist in the story, I think it is partly because I didn't really care and partly because I was fighting against sleep. Was I watching the movie in the wrong mood? Probably, will I watch it again? Probably not.Ultimately the movie fails to deliver, it's not suspenseful or scary. And the personalities do not really work. The mother goes from being very dominant to submissive by simply being tied to the bed. Sure, she is overtly dominantly ruling the house, but we get that there is no father in the gorgeous household so it's easy to think that she has taken over that role on herself. But who swifts personality like this, so easily?Isn't the creepy kid story so much of a cliché now that we really shouldn't need to see more movies about it. Certainly a person in trouble such as the mom would be smart enough to talk tons of memories to convince the kid(s) that she is indeed their mother?I recommend skipping this one."
" You're my momma
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,5,"I apologize for not liking the film. I have seen too many horror films and films with this kind of twist to enjoy this one. I had the film figured out at breakfast when mom (Susanne Wuest) snubbed Lukas, the twin of Elias. At this point the only mystery was the facial operation mom, the aging TV star, might of had...and that wasn't too hard to figure out. The fact was the clues were far too frequent and overt. A younger audience who may have missed watching classic horror films with twists or never watched the Hitchcock series might rave over this film and wonder why everyone doesn't think it's great. Yes, it is a great surprise when you open a box on Christmas morning and there is a puppy in it. The second time, not so great. The third time...boring.This is like that third puppy. And who keeps Giant cock roaches as pets?Guide: No swearing or sex. Nudity (Susanne Wuest)"
" Decent but ultimately predictable
",2018-01-07 00:00:00,6,"I decided to watch this movie after finding it on a list of horror movies made in the 2010-2017 range. While it was interesting, it was predictable and I personally figured out the surprise twist ending about a third of the way through. The ending was ultimately disappointing but i dont regret having watched it. At about the 45 minute mark it basically becomes torture porn and there were a few moments that were a little unsettling. The story is not very original especially if you have ever seen the movie ""The Other"""

" Haunting, powerful, stunning.
",2017-10-01 00:00:00,10,"Whoa! Powerful, dramatic, engrossing film. I haven't been this surprised since ""The Other"" with twins Holland and Niles. I was not expecting the ending. Caught me completely by surprise.The acting is excellent by everyone, especially the twins. I was so involved I never even thought how it might all end. Wonderful seeing a film with no CGI, no chase scenes, no explosions, no mindless action. If that's your thing you won't like this. This is going to haunt me for a long time."
" How do I even rate this?
",2017-08-23 00:00:00,5,"This movie had so much potential! The overall concept, direction, and the first 30 minutes were truly remarkable. As it continues, the middle reveals the twist in an obvious and hasty act of poor editing choices. The thrill and mystery that made the concept so fabulous completely dissolves, and I was left with disappointment. Since the beginning was so great, I continued to watch, regardless of its obvious direction. Instead of explaining what everyone is hoping they'll explain, they decide to continue on the obvious path. The operation on the mother is never explained, nor is the father's absence. These two major topics could have, and should have, been a MAJOR part of the story, but instead, they decided to focus on what we already know. Furthermore, the movie continued to go super dark and twisted. When torture is involved, usually it is used to show shock or revenge against a disliked or deserving character. The torture in this is gratuitous and sick. How does a child come up with so many clever ways to inflict emotional and physical pain? I was left mad. Mad that the movie killed its only treasures, and how it made a kid(s), who lives alone in the country, a mastermind of dealing pain. Finally, the end was awful, but I was glad, because at least it was over."
" Not worth it
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,1,"I usually like long and drawn out movies that have an ambiguous ending, and that's what I was expecting out of this movie. I'd heard reviews that had raved about this movie and its 'twist ending'. The minute I started the movie, I knew the twist. It isn't even a unique one. It was too long and too drawn out with little to no point in the ending. Reviews and descriptions of this movie detail how the extremely ambiguous ending is good, because of all the different paths you might have predicted happened in the completely unexplained history in this movie. They start many paths that could happen, but then nothing is explained, not even in a way that makes you think. All you can think is ""okay, what? and why? and what is the point?"" I've never hated a movie before, but this one was just pointless."
" Disappointing ""horror"" movie
",2017-07-24 00:00:00,1,"The story is very predictable but the acting is alright. Just one of those movies where nothing happens the entire time and all of a sudden the movie is over! whatever happened to good old movies, even slow movies can be fun and entertaining, this one just isn't! you already know the end of the movie by the first five minutes into it"
" Chilling
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,8,"Goodnight Mommy is a great example of how more can be done with far, far less than many movies attempt. Also known by its original title of Ich seh ich seh (German for I See I See), it was written and directed by Austrian filmmakers Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala in both of their full-length feature film debuts. It perfectly demonstrates how the familiar can be much more terrifying than any outside monster could dream.It opens with twins Elias and Lukas (played by Elias and Lukas Schwarz) playing outside while they await their mother's return from cosmetic facial surgery. Things are immediately awry as mom (played by Susanne Wuest) now acts very strangely — ordering them to keep the blinds closed and noise to a minimum to aid in her recovery, but also pointedly ignoring Lukas and lashing out at Elias when he misbehaves. The boys soon start to suspect that the woman under the bandages isn't their real mother** SPOILERS! **They did an amazing job at even making some of the most benign scenes — the boys playing before their mother's return, for example — have this air of forlornness to them. Even before she arrives at home you feel this strong sense of loneliness from them, despite the fact that they are constantly together.Every interaction between mother and sons manages to be either awkward, stiff, and fumbling or downright hostile — or sometimes both. If a scene isn't tough to watch because of actual disturbing images (which are surprisingly few and far between), it's tough because you're witnessing such a sterile, seemingly unfamiliar interaction between family. She treats them like unwanted strangers most of the time, despite their obvious pleas for affection.As I mentioned, the truly disturbing images and scenes are few and far between — this movie relies more heavily on an implied, psychological type of horror — but the ones that do exist are intense. Even somewhat subtle ones, like when one of the boys tries to peek in on the mother while she's in the bathroom with her bandages off and she hears the creak of the door and we see her heavily bloodshot eye catch a glimpse of him in a magnifying mirror. Truly chilling. Or the mom standing in front of the full- length mirror with a sheer nightgown on — an image that, on its face, shouldn't be so disturbing but in the full context of the movie I thought it was brilliant. In another scene, they put a cockroach from their collection onto her face as she sleeps and watch it crawl into her mouth. In one, we see the mother from above, tied to the bed, having recently peed herself, and she's almost reminiscent of the crucifixion. In another, we only hear a torture scene from the boys' room, the shot centered around a walkie-talkie on the shelf.There's some pretty heavy implications throughout of the mother being severely depressed. Some of the signs are written off as necessary parts of her recovery process, but I definitely got the impression that she was deeply sad — the shades are all drawn, absolute quiet is demanded, no visitors, ordering a year's worth of frozen pizzas, unexpected snaps of rage, and one scene in particular where she fakes being asleep when one of the twins tried to get her after the doorbell rang, or when she rushes to get her bandages back on upon the twins returning home after playing outside. We, of course, find out why later on, but I thought it was an interesting view on how isolating and confusing depression can be, both for the person suffering from it and those who are close to them.There were so many great shots where they highlighted the twins' similarities while also making sure not to make them perfectly symmetrical — them laying with the dead cat, sitting against the tub bleeding from their noses, one of them kneeling at the cross while the other stands.The tension is high throughout the whole film, but it really ramps up when they start seriously suspecting that their mother is not who she claims to be. Watching their paranoia grow was alarming as they start to train themselves to withstand beatings, carving weapons, and keeping guard one at a time. When they get to the point of actually tying her up and interrogating her, it's amazing how much you really don't know WHO you side with. There is evidence mounting on both sides — both of them being overly paranoid and of her actually being a fake somehow — that you just flip flop back and forth the entire time. It makes some of the torture scenes very confusing because, while hard to watch no matter what, there is part of you that feels for these boys — you can feel their loneliness, their betrayal, their deep sadness. And, ultimately, the twins are brilliantly written as they vacillate so quickly between cruelty and sympathy, sometimes even in the same action — they burn her face, but then put antiseptic on it, right before taping her mouth. They superglue her mouth shut (one of the most WTF moments of the whole film), but then cut it open to feed her, all the while begging her to please prove that she's their mom. It's desperate in a very raw way.The ending, beginning with her escaping, is the perfect sort of crescendo of chaos. And the reveal — that Lukas died along with their father in an accident — was SHOCKING, truly. One of those truly great moments in a film where you say ""ohhhhHHHH"" and so many previous moments snap into place and make sense. It's an insane talent to be able to put a movie together with that much seamless complexity.Overall, just awesome. Truly chilling, amazing mood all around, and incredible acting from everyone involved."
" An idyllic creepy movie
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,6,"This is one of those movies that without utilizing jump scares get through to you. The setting is lonely house and increases the sense of suffocation and solitude so much more. The twin boys played their role to perfection. The entire first half of the movie has you convinced of their innocence yet as the movie progresses, you can see just how evil the look in their eyes are. The ending has me so surprised, I think the movie needs another viewing to appreciate all the scenes again. By no means it is a movie that will warrant a second viewing but a decent movie nonetheless."
" A typical European movie
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,4,"When I started watching it, I've expected it to be a psychological thriller. In the third act, it finally caught up to its premises. It starts off pretty good with a mother returning to her children. Sadly we don't find much more after that. The movie never bothers explaining any backstory or premises, that may lead to a somewhat of a plot twist. Sadly it is exposed so obviously, that after 15 minutes you already expect it. The movie itself from one side tries to convince you that the woman under the bandages is not the mother, but at the same time pushes a subplot that she actually is the real mother. And this was the only good ""psychology"" point of this movie, the question whether or not it is her. Besides it, the pacing is slow, the build up is filled with useless actions and exposition shots. The acting on the other hand is good for the most part. As a conclusion I would like to say that to movie starts with one premises and halfway through it starts to change the view of protagonist and antagonist, leading to the third act. I can't get into details without spoiling it, but it is just pointless. And the ending is lacking satisfaction and climax. It is what I call a typical European movie. Trying too hard to be something it is not and thus shifting its plot all over the place."
" But I can't see him......
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,7,"In a lonesome house in the countryside lives nine-year-old twin brothers who are waiting for their mother. When she comes home, bandaged after cosmetic surgery, nothing is like before. The children start to doubt that this woman is actually their mother. It emerges a struggle for identity and trust.........What could have been a really good psychological thriller, is ruined by camera angles and mise en scene, because as soon a mother gets home, the twist is spoiled by these two crucial elements.This alleviates any potential mystery that surrounds the mother, and the narrative arc between her and her children. If the makers had have been more careful with the script and position of the three main characters, this could have been a lot more tense for the audience, rather than them waiting for the predictable reveal.Other than that, it's pretty solid stuff, the first two acts are creepy enough, with mother acting mysterious her gait and characteristics coming straight from Les Yeux Sans Visage, and the house being shadowed like The Others.The final act goes down the torture porn route, and whilst it's not as visceral as an Eli Roth film, the fact that the act is being committed by a minor, makes the whole sequence highly unsettling.So aside from the fact that the film literally gives the twist away as soon as mother gets home, the film has a good story and some wonderful cinematography, and the final third is pretty heartbreaking."
" Psychological horror with a good premise..
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,6,"I usually avoid watching non-English movies with subs because I hate paying attention to text more than the scene and acting (and god forbid you miss reading the dialogue while you decided to focus on the action). This movie is in German so had to live with the subs, it was OK since nothing really ""crazy"" is happening in majority of the scenes. So if you're like me, go for it. It isn't like Amelie (which was mostly visuals).Anyway, most of the scenes in this movie try to show something sinister with long drawn out actions and suspenseful music, along with some sound effects here and there. It kinda works, it definitely adds to the tension and makes you imagine the worst things about the mom. In-fact, the movie outright lies to the viewer and shows fake scenes trying to make things look sinister which, to be honest, was not needed.Too bad the movie actually fails to deliver with the ending. I despise movies which throw in jump ""scares"", and this movie avoids them majority of the time. Psychological horror in this movie works until it all goes downhill in second half where the whole movie becomes way too predictable, including the twist they're aiming for. In-fact, having watched such movies before, even saw the ending coming a miles away.That said, it's one of the VERY few unique psychological horror movies out there and you should watch it just for that reason alone. But prepare for long hauls of nothing happening on-screen and payoff being dull. Watch it for atmosphere, which is well done."
" Loses any credibility it had very early on
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,5,"The idea behind this film isn't bad at all, but the execution falls well short of its potential. As with any horror film, you have to give the plot some leeway, but 'Goodnight Mommy' is so poorly written that it's impossible to overlook the many flaws and unanswered questions.Questions such as: Why is the mother so evasive and unpleasant to the children when she returns home? Why is her entire head mummified from a cosmetic procedure that, when she takes the bandages off, appears to be minor? If it was the mother all along, why could she not remember basic information about her children when asked? These are crucial aspects of the plot and are impossible to overlook.Not to mention the ridiculous scene where two strangers invite themselves into the house (and then take a good look around!) when nobody answers the door. Is that normal in Austria or something? 'Goodnight Mommy' kept my attention throughout, but it loses its credibility very early on."
" A very good drama that reminds me of Antichrist and Babadook
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,7,"With over 100 reviews to date, I will only add that this movie is a great depiction of denial, grieve and guilt. The rest is cinematography and acting, which are as good, by the way. It's sad to read so many bad reviews criticizing the badly hidden twist, when it was never intended to be hidden. It's shown very early what's really happening and we just have to watch how these characters deal with the terrible situation. Whoever doesn't get it in the beginning should watch fewer teenager horror gory flicks and pay more attention to what happens below the surface in films like this one. It reminds me of the Antichrist and Babadook psychotic managing of guilt and grieve."
" Well this had me gasping
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,8,"I can't understand anyone writing a bad review of this film... it was beautifully executed, the acting was spot on, especially the little boys who were subtle and complex. I was taken on a ride of increasing unease, and I had no idea which way this was going to jump. Anyone who claims otherwise I think might be giving themselves too much credit for their skill at preempting plots but lack of ability to simply enjoy.Personally by the end I was squirming in a sort of horrified, impressed way. This little gem came out of nowhere for me. The ability to construct a non-cluttered, non Hollywood character based film like this is incredible to behold, and I take my hat off to the director, crew and cast.Fantastic low budget but artfully made psychological horror, don't listen to the expert naysayers, they probably are the sort to yell quiz answers out loud rather than write them down."
" This film is an offending plagiary!
",2017-01-30 00:00:00,2,"I decided to find and watch this film because of some good reviews on IMDb, stating it was a state-of-the-art movie in terms of cinematography, shot framing, atmosphere and aesthetics. I am a lover of cinema as art myself, but this film has little to do with art. And the worst thing about it is that the whole story is stolen from another movie of which a remake already exists, so I have seen the same story already twice before watching this film. Even if I had not seen it, the 'twist' about the plot is made so apparent here - as opposed to the original, where it came for me as a surprise, really - that you have got it after three minutes from the start at latest. The directors spared no effort to make the 'twist' as evident as possible to the viewer in the very beginning. As a result, the narrative perspective is marred, because if you see the story under the premise of the 'twist', you cannot switch to the perspective of another person, who would see the whole thing different - but exactly this happens later in the movie (unfortunately, I cannot say more without spoiling it). The film is annoyingly boring. It is so boring I switched it off in the middle and watched it to the end later only to prove my first impression of it. It has a strong claim to be ""art-house cinema"", but the directors misunderstood this concept: art-house does not mean being as boring as possible, and it in no way involves stealing the plot from an earlier movie. Yes, there is some skillful cinematography in it, but it serves only to make beautiful things look ugly: not only do all characters look ugly and evoke no sympathy at all, but even the landscape and the house look dull and ugly. Psychologically, the film is also completely flawed because this family never communicates with each other for no evident reason, so as a viewer, you keep asking yourself why they never talk. You do not care for any of the characters, there is no tension, no grip, no actual reason for watching. And, as I said earlier, all these flaws are completed by simple plagiary. Spare your time and do not watch this flawed, pretentious piece of wannabe-art-house. Watch the original from which they stole instead."
