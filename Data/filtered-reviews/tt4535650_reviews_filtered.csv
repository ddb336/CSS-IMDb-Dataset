" If SRK and Kajol werent the cast, don't watch it.
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,5,"If you are fans of SRK and Kajol, and have watched their previous projects for hundred times already, you named it, then you must feel disappointed with this movie. You might wont question their chemistry no more, they always deliver their best. But Dilwale was like a huge hole that you cannot even mend it anymore. Some scenes were super cringe and looks so cheap even for bollywood level. They took some scenes overseas tho but it didnt help much. Their Gerua's clip was exceptionally breathtaking and the only thing I honestly like from the entire movie.The movie also tried to make some montage scenes which I think it was the way to emphasize the sorrow, how they were both in pain as the result of their forbidden love but it didnt work at all. It was actually confusing.Look at the movie's premise, I might say that it's interesting enough. However they didnt produce it well enough to gain viewers sympathy.
If the main casts werent SRK and Kajol, it will be just another expensive-but-ordinary bollywood movie."
" Bad acting, absurd dialogues and ridiculous plot
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,1,"As per the title, this movie is just as bad as it can get. The current ratings is justified by the fans of the starring actors like Khan and Kajol. I want my time back."
" Must Watch This Movie
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,10,"With awesome storyline this movie is just epic, its like the love story which doesn't gonna ends.Starting with future scenes and in some time emotional past scenes give special impact to the story.Music is brilliant, no any doubt about that. . . Acting of SRK, Varun and kriti was just at there best but kajol looks only good, because of Lefting to movie after comeback to 5 years. . . And the all the way This is just a classy looks of SRK and Kajol.This movie is all about The special Jodi of SRK and kajol ðŸ˜„. I'm Damn Sure, if you are neutral, then sure, you will like this movie :-)"
" SRK + Kajol treat, other characters were not as good.
",2020-06-29 00:00:00,8,"SRK and Kajol are an absolute treat in this film. The mafia-level love story in the flashbacks and on present time are wonderful to watch; the two veteran actors have proved through this film that even after 20 years of being Bollywood's favorite jodi, they can still deliver. I loved watching SRK and Kajol. Their gazes are intense, their expressions genuine and their tears pull on the heartstrings. They operate and act on another whole level compared to the rest. Unfortunately, the sideline characters / actors are atrocious and bring this movie down many levels. Their comedic lines do not deliver. They overact to the point it becomes cringey, and it feels all too superficial.SRK does a particularly good job in the action scenes. Kajol's icy stare can give you chills. Rohit Shetty's car scenes and beautiful shots in Goa and the background are mesmerizing.The particularly bad thing about this film is the lack of a concrete conflict, especially in the second half. It feels scattered and aimless when it should be building up to the main clash.There's bad writing and dialogue on this one, which is a far shame for such a strong ensemble cast. After all, with great power comes great responsibility. Because of their super stardom (particularly SRK) and numerous awards, expectations are high and they have the skill and charisma to meet it. They are timeless. This movie is not. SRK and Kajol deserved better.Lower your expectations though and you'll get such fun family entertainment for all!"
" Nostalgic to watch Kajol and Shah Rukh Khan!
",2020-06-26 00:00:00,9,"This movie brings back so many childhood memories of watching Kajol and Shah Rukh Khan together! Absolutely loved this movie!
Full fledged massy entertainer!"
" These reviews are disgusting
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,10,"This movie is a family entertainer. My dad always falls asleep when a Bollywood movie starts, but for once he was interested in a movie.Everyone is saying the acting was bad, well you go and act. I bet you can't even stand there for a second. So instead of throwing hate u need to understand how much these actors and actresses worked.The music was awesome. I really liked the comedy scenes.
This movie is awesome! It's on Netflix so go watch it! Trust me, these reviews are written because they don't like the cast, they don't care about the story. Please watch it!-BollywoodFan from the NetherlandsðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±"
" Despite everyones complaints, I loved it.
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,10,"Honestly a lot of people are saying the 10 stars are fake, but I assure you my rating is not fake. To be entirely honest I watched the movie back when it came out, and loved it then and I love it now. I even re-watched it, which is a lot considering I NEVER re-watch shows unless it's that good. The reviews are saying it's cliche and I admit to a certain extent yes, but the videography. music and story line makes up for it. Yes it's a cliche, kind of like a Romeo and Juliet but they end up together in the end, however I don't see this cliche being done well often, and a lot of romances are based off of the cliche as subtle as it can be it's there. So that's nothing new, honestly I loved the idea and direction the story took, the actors acted many scenes wonderfully, I admit a few scenes were wonky but it was 2015 lmao. I love this movie full heartedly, and I don't like many indian movies. Maybe it's because I watch more english movies? No I watch more shows then movies and even that isn't entirely true.. I'm a Otaku so, I watch a lot of anime or at least used to, now I read Manga, and a lot of webcomics. I watch a lot of Kdrama, maybe that's why? Nevertheless my opinion stays the same even if you ask me years from now. Wish it got a sequal!"
" Terrible !
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,4,"I give 4 star because of Shahrukh khan, Kajol, Varun and kriti. Otherwise there is no story. Everything is over dramatic. But romance of SRK and Kajol made some magical things. Songs are awesome. Specially 'Gerua' and 'Janam Janam'."
" School stage drama..!!
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,1,This looked liked a school stage drama. Not only Shah's over acting was stage like as always even the sets looked so fake and made up..! Watched it only because of Varun Dhawan. But even he should be more wise in not choosing such rubbish movies.
" Worst movie
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,1,"Worst movie i have ever seen in my life, its too boring and too predictable!"
" Great film to watch with the family!
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,8,"When I first saw the film itself, it was so romantic and comedy at the same time. Some parts of the film made me very happy and other parts very sad especially with the songs that were in this film. Overall, this film I would say is a great film to watch with family and couples..."
" just hhhhhh
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,4,"Although Bollywood films in India, especially translated at home, have always been good. But this is only a comedy without bright spots, basically similar to domestic New year movies, good people and bad people are all for funny, so the development of the story does not need logic, just for happy."
" Omg it's like inception
",2020-02-29 00:00:00,1,As the leads were saying this junk is inception well this is not even close to worst movie ever made that bad this movie is
" Absolute garbage from Rohit shetty
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,1,Not expected that much of trash.Really disappointed to see srk not even trying to act.
" Good songs, terrible film.
",2020-01-13 00:00:00,3,"Seriously, this film only exists to please SRK-Kajol shippers. It's 100% banking on the nostalgia of older classic SRK-Kajol films to make a quick cash grab. And they managed to do it. The film is unnecessarily long, considering the plot is simple. You would have thought they have settle it sooner. The plot is borderline 80s - 90s Hindi films clichÃ©. I thought the genre had died already 20 years past 2000. Apparently, it's still alive.The action is full-package unapologetically over-the-top. But considering the stupid jokes and plotline, I actually welcomed it. The only real good thing it has got it going is its well-choreographed dance numbers and songs. But having said that, most Indian films has that quality. So that's not out of the ordinary.A very bad film. If anyone even mentions this film besides Kuch Kuch Hota Hai is an insult to Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. 2 out of 5."
" Crapwale
",2019-06-10 00:00:00,1,"Dilwale had all the scope to be a well packaged commercial entertainer but Rohit shetty, yunus sajwal entirely wasted the opportunity. Kajol might have signed this because Rohit being her husband's frequent colleague but SRK? Why on earth he could give approval to this script? Weak story, bad script, lame jokes and awful acting from almost every cast. I was waiting till end for some twist regarding Kali and Maya's parents death but all turned a damp squib with just a misunderstanding. Only good thing of this film is action scenes which are slick and not over the top like typical shetty films but without proper emotions how will the action scenes create an impact? A film only made to cash on the craze of Srk-kajol jodi."
" Waste of time ðŸ˜‚
",2019-05-01 00:00:00,1,"Pathetic acting by each and everyone. Kajol doesn't even suit in the dresses she wore and struggled to walk in ðŸ”¥ Overacting mostly.
The entire crew cheated audience by advertising Dilwale as a sequel.
It's way too dramatic and stupid really!
Loved Arijits song! That was the only good thing!"
" Engaging Masala
",2019-04-23 00:00:00,9,"Raj (Shah Rukh Khan) is devoted to his younger brother Veer (Varun Dhawan), but has kept family secrets from him. When Veer falls in love with Ishita (Kriti Sanon), Raj's past romance with Meera (Kajol) comes to light, affecting both couples.This is an engaging masala film, with generally well-written comedy and drama, and nicely choreographed action sequences. As always, Khan and Kajol have near perfect chemistry, and their acting is excellent. Dhawan was natural and a good comedian, but Sanon was stiff and not fully convincing at times. The songs are mostly good, with one song memorably so, and the incidental music was particularly effective. The locations were beautiful, and the movie looked superb overall. Dilwale is thoroughly enjoyable, just barely missing ten stars, and one worth rewatching.(Cast also includes Johnny Lever and Vinod Khanna.)"
" One of the worst movies in the history of Bollywood
",2019-03-21 00:00:00,1,Nothing to say here. I just want my money back. I better enjoy watching empty screen than this useless piece of crap.
" ambitiously awful
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,5,"A discombobulating, exhausting, and ultimately uninspired melodrama. While its dazzling colors and impressive production values are nothing short of eye-popping, Dilwale lacks a coherent and original narrative, opting instead to add plot twists one after another, as well as superfluous sub-stories that overstay their welcome. Given the talent and budget at director Rohit Shetty's disposal, the result is disappointing."
" Dont watch
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,3,"Story is so bad and stupid and makes us chuckle at times.
Why is this film even made. Why fool audience with such film.
Saw the film for only sharukh and disappointed
Now what is this movie. 3/10"
" Love it !!!
",2018-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Sorry to all the haters but I like this movie and I've watched it a quite a few times and I will be buying it soon , that way I can watch anytime . I highly recommend this movie if you enjoy a just plain entertaining movie."
" Dilwale (2015)
",2018-03-22 00:00:00,1,The movie was very bad. One of the worst movie of SRK. Nobody acted good in the movie. Songs and BGM were also very bad. Boring movie. Worst Movie.
" A film caught between brilliance and awfulness
",2017-08-19 00:00:00,7,"Diwale is very much a tale of two wildly different films which have been edited together into one, with the hope that no-one notices. Half of the film is a good gangster love story sets across eras, the other half is an atrocious comedy caper. The Quality Part: The West-Side Story-esque plot between Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol's characters is actually very good, and there are solid flashback scenes which are convincing in terms of looks and subtle differences in characterisation. The modern day scenes with these (more jaded) characters also works well, even if it is all resolved a little too easily at the end. Goa looks gorgeous, and the stylised nature of the way the movie is shot actually sets off the movie well (Although some sound-effects during the fighting scenes are distracting). It's a unapologetic brash modern car-chase shooting-fighting movie and if the film had simply been this story line, it would have been great. Side note: It has to be said, Shah Rukh Khan is so ridiculously on a different level to all the other actors in the film, it was like watching Robert De Niro circa Raging Bull era being forced to act in an Adam Sandler movie. He, and to some extent Kajol, who is less consistent, deserve much much better than this. They are the only people in the cast who appeared to turn up, work hard and actually act, so kudos to them. The Terrible Part: But what brings the whole film down is the supporting cast and side-plots which have little purpose other than demonstrating terrible 'comedy' and limited performance skills, sometimes so bad it actually ruins the film. The younger love story is boring and superficial, but only raises a little when it intertwines with the love story of their older siblings. The other characters linked to the sub-plot (plot may be too strong a word) of the drug cartel/black marketeers are terrible, and serve little purpose at all. You could have easily deleted an hour off this movie by editing out these characters, and it would have been much better. Best scene: Towards the start of the film in the hospital, Shah Rukh Khan's change from one 'aspect' of his character to another without moving a muscle, his transformation as seen only in his eyes is brilliant. Worst Scene(s): A toss-up between the Ramlal/Pogo stupidity, or any scene with the car-part black marketeers."
" A Horribly Wasted Kajol-Shah Rukh Jodi
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,3,"I love to see Kajol and King Khan together, I mean who doesn't? But this movie was so boring, so stupid and pointless with forgettable uninteresting songs that even watching these two together on the screen couldn't stop me from fast-forwarding. I think the only, and only reason for them to have accepted to star in this horrible movie was kind of like that of Bill Murray's signing the Garfield movie thinking ""Joel Coen"" (one of the Coen brothers) has written it, later finding out it was written by a ""Joel Cohen"" with a big H for Horrible!! Shah and Kajol too signed the contract without reading the script based on Rohit Shetty's name and when they found out what a swamp they've gotten themselves into they contractually couldn't get out.Looking at Aamir's movies in recent years such as PK and Dangal and Shah's Dilwale, I must say I am so disappointed in my favorite Khan.The 3 stars are only for the song they had together which I can't even remember what it was about, but they were beautiful and the cinematography of that song was mesmerizing."
" Very Enjoyable Movie
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,7,"I'm not certain why there are so many negative reviews on the movie Dilwale (2015). I watch a lot of International movies, most of which are movies from India/Bollywood, and I found Dilwale to be very enjoyable! I hadn't seen the movie, but was looking for one that would touch on drama, romance and comedy, but not be too over the top or leave me sad like ""Kal Ho Na Ho"" did. Whew! That one was tough! This movie wasn't tragic, too romantically intense or ridiculous; it was simply a ""sit back and relax"" kind of movie.The only thing in the movie that annoyed me was the 5 minute date. That was a bit corny, but not intolerable.I found this movie to be very entertaining! It had a good story, it was fun (Johnny Lever always makes me laugh), and of course, SRK and Kajol were best matched as a couple for this movie.So, I would have to give this movie a definite thumbs up!"
" Dilwale is a paisa vasool entertainer
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,9,"Dilwale is out and out an entertaining and a family film. What's good: Acting, Direction, Excellent music, Cinematography, Humour, Dialogues, Action, Chemistry among actors, Cinematography. What's bad: Editing could be better. Verdict: Dilwale is a package which will attract mass audiences. Class audiences will also like it if they emphasize entertainment over content."
" One of the best movies since DDLJ
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,10,Hi I am a big Shahrukh fan and i loved the movie to bits. I literally cried when shahrukh and kajol find each other. Amazing movie 5 stars 10 stars 100stars. After watching the movie I went for a long walk in NewZealand and I've decided that shahrukh khan should be president of NZ. Shahrukh is the best i love all his movies
" Awful
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,1,"The movie begins in Goa, where Raj leaves his auto repair shop to confront Mani for stealing a man's cell phone. Mani tells Raj that he is stealing it for his younger brother, whom he must care for after both of their parents died. While out driving, Veer sees a woman, Ishita, hitchhiking but his friend refuses to pick her up.

However, he falls asleep anyway and awakes to find that the car's sound system has been stolen. Siddhu takes it to a pawn shop to sell it, having stolen the sound system while Veer was asleep.The men of the local gang leader, King, try to sell drugs at a crab shack. Veer beats them up after they threaten Ishita. They then come back later to exact revenge on Veer, but Raj breaks up the fight.

Raj tells King's men his gangster name, Kaali. King stops by Raj's shop the next day to present a deal where Raj will fix all of King's cars in exchange for protection.The film then flashes back to Bulgaria.

When he gets out to help her, the rival gang catches up with him, and he has to leave. Later, Raj runs into Meera again, who works as a sketch artist.

At first he refuses to listen to her, but then he admits that he loves her, too. They make plans to tell their parents about their relationship."
" Heartless
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,3,The same thing we have seen a thousand times. It is often slow. SRK and Kajol were okay most of the way. Plot was terrible. Many of the lines were parodies from previous movies. Johnny Lever and Boman Irani were misused and the comedy was the worst. The character that goes by the name Oscar is similar to many comedic characters and the way he speaks is annoying. Frankly why does he do that. It is not the least bit funny. Raj and Meera had chemistry but that is only due to the history the audience has with the duo SRK and Kajol. The movie got a little lucky here but for there to be chemistry between the characters some effort should be put into character development. The movie has none of that. Veer and Ishita fell in love too quickly so it is just not believable. All these shortcomings add up to a forgettable filth of a film.
" not what i expected..
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,4,"When I heard Kajol and SRK were making a movie together, I was super excited and had Dilwale at the top of my watch list. I was so happy that it showed up in Netflix and didn't waste any time to waiting to watch it. But, after finishing this 2 hr and 33 min movie, I don't think it was all that. I didn't care for the songs and the movie felt like it was on a cheap budget because of all the green screens they used. I will always love Kajol and SRK, but I felt their characters weren't that good. Their whole story was the clichÃ© ""old time love at first sight"" situation that gets screwed up because of a misunderstanding. The few action scenes were a little cool but the action part is just last because the the ""whole love story mess"" and ""family first"" theme comes first. Also, those new actors, I found their characters to be pretty stupid (probably cause they were supposed to be the comedy part of the movie). Anyway, I rated the movie a four because there are some good parts but overall, the movie's just a cheesy romance."
