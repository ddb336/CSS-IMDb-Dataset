" It just gets better and better!
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,9,"Another thought provoking, beautiful and feels-fresh movie by Gauri Shinde !
This modern day classic starring the acting prodigy Alia Bhatt just gets better every second during its runtime. Starts a bit slow and off-beat but rather makes up for it in the latter half. Amazing mature work by the ever charming SRK and soulful music makes it a modern classic and must watch for all ages.Kaira(Alia Bhatt), a young ambitious lady has her issues with personal life mainly due to a disturbing past. She seeks guidance from a psychiatrist when she feels like losing control of everything and becomes insomniac. Alia's monologue where she describes the events of her past is one of her finest performances!
Movies involving psychiatrist roles requires good dialogues to make it more appealing and Dear Zindagi has got this covered just right and those coming from the mouth of SRK brings him real close to Robin Williams from the 1992 classic 'Good will hunting'."
" Too good
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,9,I think one of the best movie in drama genre it's cinematography and music is really good and acting is up to mark but some time u think about movie length because it 2:30hrs little bit draggy in the middle apart from that this film rocks
" One of the best performance of Shah Rukh Khan
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,9,This movie teaches some best lessons of life. How to look upon a bad phase in life and how to overcome that phase. Dr Jug nailed every single minute of his presence in the film. That explanation to Alia with the example of chairs was just love.
" Dealing with our limitations and issues become easier when done properly
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,9,"What worked:
This movie deserves a special applaud for what it was able to do with the movie. This movie has by far one of the best screenplays in Hindi movie in the recent times, as good as or par to Taare Zameen Par. I have come to this conclusion from multiple viewing. Gauri deserves praise for the writing and excellent execution. It's also one of Alia's finest performances and definitely best for Shah Rukh in the recent times, personally. Amit Trivedi, as always, had the fine music and an excellent score making it a very beautiful experience. Also, as a mental health professional, I appreciate the research that the makers put in the screenplay, especially dealing with the client. This movie is a case study in itself and is very well researched and executed. Overall, it's a fine piece of cinema with a very heartwarming story, fine performances, strong narrative, great dialogues and brilliant background score.What did not work:
I must say although a thorough research has been done on the mental health profession, we can see some ethical concerns as well as some professional issues that needed handling. But keeping it at a minimal level in itself a great thing. Also, songs could have been cut down or if necessary taken out except the ones very necessary l.
Final verdict: highly recommended"
" Dialogues are thoughtful
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,8,While watching you have to pause just because dialogues make you stop and think about your own life. Beautiful.
" MUST WATCH !
",2020-10-29 00:00:00,9,"Its a beautiful film , and honestly it shows struggles that millennials face in this modern generation. It also shows that mental health is as important as physical health and that going to therapy should be normalised in the society. Even the acting done by Alia Bhatt and SRK is fabulous."
" Mental Health
",2020-10-24 00:00:00,10,"The movie is amazing for showing the mental health issues a troubled childhood has on an individual even after so many years. It normalises visiting a psychologist every now and then to seek help/advice. Congratulations to scriptwriter of this movie, it is beautiful !!!"
" Boring
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,1,"I remember actually walking out of the theatre. My film bored me completely. After English Vinglish, I'd better expectations from Gauri Shinde but this one thoroughly disappointed me."
" Miss me Kiara!
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,9,"Seems like Kiara is the alter ego of Alia Bhatt,now if you see this film you'll get a nostalgic hit and Gauri shinde takes the charm again,kudos to the whole team,I loved it"
" ""Dear zindagi, I know we haven't been in touch for a while. So, nothing. Just wanted to say hi.""
",2020-09-15 00:00:00,9,"As the movie ends, Kaira walks barefoot by the sea with her camera dangling over her shoulder, and I can feel my nerves calm down.This isn't the Kaira we met first, she didn't always so fearlessly play Kabaddi with the sea.
Kaira starts off as cold, cynical and distant. If you met a Kaira today, there's high chance you'd want to keep your distance. The most prominent bit of her character is discontent - never being enough, never feeling enough. She craves freedom. She's unable to put a finger on it but countless times you see her asserting, ""mein azaad hona chahti hoon!""
Jug. His unconventional methods lead Kaira to begin therapy. When often we're made to believe therapy is for the 'crazy', Jug makes her believe it's okay. It's okay to feel, to let it out, to take the easier route, to look at a few ""qursis"" before you pick the right one.It's okay to let go.
Jug heals Kaira through stories. Which backs up something I say very often - we need stories to survive. We need storytellers. And, if you may, I'd like to think of Jug as a storyteller, more than a therapist.
The scene where Kaira breaks down, finally trusting Jug with her past, is very dear to me. Especially when she apologises for breaking down, that's when Jug gives us what we've all been wanting to hear all our lives - ""Agar khul ke rou gi nahi, tou khul ke hans kese paogi?""And then she walks out of that session, freed. Jug was right. Wo ab khul ke hanss rahi thi.""Safe feel karnay ke liye pehlay saray darr mitana zaroori hai!"" Kaira had moved through life carrying the weary load of her past on her. She feared abandonment, and the fear itself never let her commit. Unshackling gave her closure. She was now ready to move on, ready to feel safe.As their last sessions approaches, Kaira is healed. She's healed enough to lay open her feelings for Jug, and healed enough to handle rejection. She takes one last look at everything, especially at 'the kursi that only creaks when you like someone, but can't do anything about it"".
As Jug lets go of Kaira, the kursi creaks. Kaira is now free. Enlightened. Alive. Her past doesn't hold her back anymore."
" Nice execution but weak plot.
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,6,This film has got some real good talents like ShahRukh Khan and Alia bhatt. The ultimate message of the film is also great but the entire plot is really weak. There is no hook in the story which makes it stand out the rest. Though the Psychologist and patient relationship is shown good enough but the lead protagonist has no deep back story. A lot was expected out of this one but kind of misfits the Story part.
" Bad basic acting over rated
",2020-08-17 00:00:00,1,"Bad acting skills
Over rated film
After watching feels like why why did I watch that"
" Beautiful
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,8,"Some imp life lessons. Some imp take aways.
Beautifully crafted movie.
Alia bhatt did a fantastic performance
SRK was also too good as Jahangir"
" Charismatic SRK gets you thinking
",2020-07-12 00:00:00,7,"Watched this before but felt like watching it again. Got me thinking about instances when I felt I struggled.Some questions for you,
Why punish yourself to get the important things in life?Why not take the easy way out?Why hold on to something if you don't like it? Why prolong the suffering?"
" Alia Bhatt's solution for failed love
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,7,"7/10 Ramachandra (i-24541)
02 June 2020Every human life is like a tide of the ocean, touching the shore for sometime and retrieved back into the eternity. In the short sojourn on earth called Zindagi (Life), there can be varied relationships....some giving tremendous blows to the person and some Off/On type with their fair share of pains and pleasures.Kaira (Greek word meaning Moment), a Cinematographer by profession, lives by the moment. She does not have any rule book to follow except professional ambitions. She suffers from failure of love with Raghuvendra with whom she slept. This shattered her confidence in life and she battles with her guilt, frustration, humiliation and revenge.Dr. Jahangir Khan, a psychiatrist tries to heal the trauma Kaira is undergoing. He himself is a divorcee with his son taken care of by his wife. The inadequacy of psychiatry in repairing human relationships is beautifully symbolised by his eye problem. His solution for a broken heart is simple.... one should experiment with different chairs and find out which chair is comfortable to sit on.Like a paper-boat aimlessly drifting in water, Kaira's mind tangos between her conscience and vanity. Sid (Restaurant owner) and Rumi (Singer) with their prejudices and Dr. Khan himself could not offer a substitute for her failed love. Dr. Khan indirectly hints her that once fell in love a human heart offers no space for others.In between it is shown that all her misdemeanors are due to her childhood upbringing away from her parents.Over various psychiatric counselling sessions with Dr. Khan, Kaira realises that every relationship is a kind of imprisonment (shown by two dogs behind a gate). She must cling to her own soul which can be achieved by a child like personality (an infant is shown smiling even at strangers) and pursuing her own professional ambitions with passion. In her debut film, she demonstrates through a Portuguese Woman Warrior that womanhood need not be disguised and subdued. A woman can fight openly like any other human spirit (without gender bias) to gain supreme sovereignty over her own life.In my opinion, 'Dear Zindagi' is resplendent with the basic psychology and philosophy of human life. Some broken hearts in their escapism renounce the world, some try to re-live and some engage in social service. Kaira searched and found her own destiny. 'Dear Zindagi-Love your own Life' is an inspirational film.The film scores high points because of energetic acting of Aliaji and subtle portrayal of a Psychiatrist by Khanji. Khanji lived in his role as he delivers his dialogues slowly and carefully as he knows 'Words cost life' for his patients-Jai Hind+Ramachandra"
" To understand about life ups & down
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,6,Yes amazing movie and it get into the nerves of child what you do them in childhood with beautiful presentation.....
" It is a must watch film
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,10,I really recommend this movie to you all .it is in my favourite movie list now. Srk and alia played a very soulfull roll. It will definitely touch your heart and you won't feel bored in 2 long hours. It has a different story line .It has very less fantasy or imagination part and has more reality part of life unlike other bollywood movies. It's scenes were so natural like how each of us react in different situations and alia carried her role really well. It's sure that Everybody will have a different experience watching it and can have a deep attachment especially for those life can be related to it. All my friends also liked it and I will recommend everyone to watch this movie
" Perfect in all ways
",2020-03-22 00:00:00,10,"This is the first movie I have ever watched of Alia Bhatt and SRK. The movie is superb in every single aspect, script, directing, acting, visual and chemistry. I can't stop replaying the scene of Dr. Jug and Kaira. The chemistry between them is exceptional despite the age gap, really wish to see them in more projects together. It's the kind of movie that I will watch again and again every time I feel down. All the dialogues of Dr. Jug and Kaira are so memorable and thought-provoking as well as soothing for lost souls... Just so in love with this movie, which is close to my heart and has a very special meaning to my life journey."
" Problems Solving, Inspiring, Aspiring, Fascinates towards Positivity
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,10,"Hey,This movie help us to solve tangled issues and problems of life, aspire us towards life, gives us hope that everything will be better someday. Positive vibes we get from it.
We need more movies like this rather than romance or action. Every story which ends with great message and happiness gives us satisfaction and joy.The way Kiara ask questions like one of normal frustrated youth and Dr. Jahangir guides her with his maturity and experience, it happens with each one of us. Some meets their Dr. Jahangir but some doesn't. This movie is for them who don't get proper guidance to tackle situations.
I hope they make its second part. It will be treat for us.Please do watch it. It's totally worth."
" Nice movie deals with physiological issues
",2020-03-10 00:00:00,9,"A must for every genre, its deals with physiological issues which today's generation is facing. Its entertaining and very realistic."
" DEAR ZINDAGI
",2019-11-04 00:00:00,10,"Saw this ALIA BHATT film after HIGHWAY because a friend pointed it out. HIGHWAY like a runaway widow was a nice movie. This one is a stark contrasting one as SHARUKH KHAN is there and KING KHAN is amazing at what he does.
Sorry be right back
bye
Loved it because it is wonderful."
" Why do the make a film with no story arc?
",2019-11-03 00:00:00,6,"I still didn't understand the purpose of making this film.
The only thing i liked about this film was that it didn't give me a headache.
The movie was a simple breeze of fresh air and story moved forward with snail pace.
Shahrukh did what he does best, played himself.
Alia again was a surprise. Is there anything that Alia Bhatt can't do.
If nepotism looks like this, then I want more nepotism from industry.
sorry, Just kidding. Like industry already isn't closed for outsiders.
Anyways, the film is all about Alia trying to find that why is she is so mean yet sweet to everybody.
Her conflicting nature is something that people don't understand and she herself doesn't understand.
Comes Mr. Khan whose own life is in shambles but wouldn't mind giving therapy to Alia in highly unconventional manner to earn some extra bucks.
His advises are good and then comes a very predictable plot twist. Alia falls in love with Khan. Duh, who didn't see that coming.
Anyways, the direction of Gauri Shinde is ok if not bad.
Screenplay needed more work and more events instead of just roaming around few locations.
Secondary cast needed to be better and I think they just casted them frivolously without bothering who was playing what.
I might have done the same knowing i have SRK and Alia in my film.
Cinematography by Laxman Utekar is good and editing could have been more crisp.
Production design in first half is not impressive but gets better in second half in real locations.
Over all a decent watch, but not something praiseworthy."
" Great movie
",2019-10-13 00:00:00,10,One of the best attempts of Bollywood to address such sensitive issue
" Alia bhatts best performance
",2019-10-13 00:00:00,10,This movie shows a state of depression after breakup and srk who is doctor helps her a lot
" is that what you call a great acting ?!?!?
",2019-10-07 00:00:00,2,"I just don't know what to say, poor acting Especially from the star of the movie ( Alia )."
" Worth of watching such healthy movie!
",2019-10-01 00:00:00,10,"I loved Alia's acting. And the presence of SRK was eye soothing ! He played his role wonderfully . Coming to the songs of the movie, I loved every lyric and tune!
Overall, I loved watching this movie. From my side, 10 on 10 . I definitely recommend the movie. Didn't only watch the movie also I came here to rate and end up reviewing!
A true, honest and HEALTHY MOVIE!"
" Raw topics handled with brilliant light handed touch
",2019-09-17 00:00:00,10,"I loved this movie and how well it brought to light a lot of issues people just don't talk about and with humour and humanity. And above all, I loved that it was shot without the over acting in Goa! Alia and Shah made the story the feature, not their star power. I'm no fan of Shah Rukh Khan but in this movie, he nailed the part with intelligent detachment, and comedy of course. I'm a new fan of Gauri Shinde. Watch this even if you don't speak Hindi, I don't either. Subtitles."
" Good concept, poor screenplay, bad story, bad humor and overacting
",2019-05-22 00:00:00,1,"It was a forgettable experience to watch this movie and loss of 2 and half hours of my life over this '(master)piece of cr*p'. The movie has nothing for its plot, so the heavy lifting should have been done by strong characters, good acting and engaging screenplay but you get none of that.It's story of a girl who has relationship issues and you get to know the reason by the end of it so it's essential for you to feel sympathy for the lead character or at least like her to the extent of caring about her issues no matter how artificial they might look on the outset, instead Aalia is shown as a completely unlikable, extremely entitled, self absorbed and arrogant girl who doesn't even have common decency. Every friend/relative of hers tolerates her rudeness for reasons that are known only to god and Gauri Shinde, instead of sympathy you feel that the she deserves lot less than what world is giving her.Her overacting in many scenes doesn't help the cause either. Shahrukh was good in his acting but some of relationship explanations given by Dr Jug had me rolling my eyes. No wonder the brain doctor is divorced in the movie.Whatever attempted humor movie has is poor, some of the jokes are outright pathetic.The screenplay is too long for what it has on offer and by the time it actually tells you actual reason for her issues, you'd couldn't care less. The sheer boredom of that journey makes you wonder was it even worth to endure the movie to that point. The reason in itself is so ridiculous that it doesn't make any sense at all to justify all the brattiness of the lead character. People are grateful for much less from their parents than what Aalia hates her parents for. Give me a break if you want us to believe that's a valid excuse to be a nasty b*tch all her life.I was exhausted by the end of the movie, went in with an expectation to see something beautiful and got this shallow, poorly written and boring movie that doesn't do justice to the concept at all."
" ABSOLUTELY AMAZING
",2019-04-28 00:00:00,8,"Another feather in SRK's hat... A perfect life lesson. Beautifully shot. What else I have to say. Believe me if you are going through a rough patch in your life then here is the treatment for you from Dr Khan... Stunning performance by Alia Bhatt, totally 180 degree of character in Raazi. A little sad in end when Jug also want to confess his feelings to Kaira but can't (you will get idea of it) ....last line simply out of the world."
" It's something fresh
",2019-04-23 00:00:00,10,There was an effortless performance by the actors. Nothing cheesy. It's a one of it's kind like movie. Everything is just perfect. Roles Alia and Srk portroyed were soo good. And Gauri Shinde's direction is lovely.
" So dull and the acting terrible
",2019-03-02 00:00:00,4,"It's good that Indian films are tackling things like mental health awareness, women's liberation and homosexuality...laudable in fact. But this one does it all within the first hour. It's so laden down with 'messages' and soooo much product placement you kind of lose track and interest in the storyline. Oh yes it's about a thoroughly dislikeable main character (who in real life would have no friends) trying to come to terms with the fact her one night stand partner is getting engaged. That's it. Why should we care as she goes around being rude and obnoxious to her friends, family and anyone else in a series of staged interludes where she screams in her room or lies there looking at her phone? Awful film - not even SRK can save it."
" Srk shines at a different role
",2019-01-15 00:00:00,10,In recent years after don 2 it's Srk's best acting performance. A measured role and a cool mental doctor.
" Inspirational movie for modern world
",2018-12-18 00:00:00,10,"This movie is way too good for lovers as it tells how to move on in life specially when you find yourself trapped in hectic situations. It made me smile, laugh, sad and emotional. Already watched it 4 times."
" Love the movie hate the B-roll filled ending ...... 6/10 {spoilers in the second part of the review}
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,6,"First of the positives....
It is a very well written and directed movie right up to the last 30 mins of the movie which we'll get to in a minute... The performances in this movie are also very well rounded no one was bad and no one other than alia, alia was extraordinary which believe it or not is a major plus for this type of story when you are dealing with such an emotional journey of a character no one around that character should be able to take away the spotlight.... And gauri succeeded in achieving just that ...... Now lets talk about Alia Bhatt's performance she just knocked it out of the park ....in fact 10 minutes into the movie and i forgot that i was watching alia bhatt.. she was so immersed in her character you cannot separate the two of them.... Srk was as always very good but he was just opposite of alia every time he was on screen instead of his character he was playing as if he is srk but is just in a different profession.... So take it as you will.... Now lets talk about the dreaded last half hour of the movie and from here on this review will definitely contains some spoilers at this time the movie has already been aired on television so I don't think spoilers matters but you've been warned....
While watching dear zindagi you can at a very early stage tell where it is going and definitely there will be a big emotional crisendo near the end where alia will pour her heart out and i was waiting for it.... And it was beautiful and moving but mathematically i was distracted by all the overpowering sappy background music and the flashback story of her childhood .... Alia bhatt is a very strong actor who can tap her inner emotions to portray such role and she could have painted a much more surreal image just by her acting but that f***ing b-roll flashback was taking me out of the movie every time it came on screen! What???? you just thought that without your guiding hand of b-roll montage we won't be able to imagine it or connect with the moment .... You know i hate you just because you assumed that your audience is stupid and wont be able to understand what is going on without flashback and you also didn't believe in the abilities of you actress which is even more annoying..... But the worst part of the movie comes after this where writer director gauri shinde tries to give you even bigger emmotional happy ending .... Ohh just go to hell ..... Will ya.... That moment when srk says cheers to you... Was a perfect moment to end the film .....NO!!!.... But you have to give us a sappy stupid happy ending and have to make the female lead fall in love with srk or we'll feel abandoned just like alia felt in the beginning of the the movie ..... I just hate this mentality ..... It was an awesome story and a lovely movie i loved every second of it until she decided that she has to be like every other director, who also assume that audience is stupid and need happy endings and sappy music filled flashbacks..... !!!!
OVERALL i give it 6/10"
" Reflection of milenials kid crisis
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,9,"The story is so well written . The actor and actress are TOP notch, The Cinematography is very beautiful."
" Love You Zindagi
",2017-12-12 00:00:00,6,"A lot of Bollywood cliches are told here in a way that feels fresh, probably because the director is a woman who is able to draw out the novelties in a female protagonist, also giving her a profession of a cinematographer that is generally uncommon. Going to a therapist in India is like abandoning your position in the society as a sane person due to which a lot of people never try it out. So this was a welcome and long awaiting concept to be a feel-good Bollywood film in which some of the biggest stars like Shahrukh Khan and Alia Bhatt gives charming performances. Kaira is not always a likeable person and neither did they add any unrealistic romantic turns that usually plagues Bollywood but her character arc is relatable. Even though preachy at times, India will never have enough films talking about the f**ked up parenting of the country and the trauma's that is passed through generations."
" Stupid movie
",2017-08-21 00:00:00,1,"Stupid movie, don't waste your time. If this movie is truly 7.9*, Bollywood standards and audience expectation has definitely gone low. SRK come too late in movie, by that time Ali Bhatt make sure you that you already gonna hate this movie. Ali Bhatt broke all ceiling of over acting."
" Snoozefest turkey..
",2017-08-19 00:00:00,1,"In Mumbai and Goa, Kaira (Alia Bhatt) is a promising cinematographer who wishes to direct her own films. Blunt and cynical, she is most comfortable when with her three best friends, Fatima (Ira Dubey), Jackie (Yashaswini Dayama) and Ganju (Gautmik). Kaira's life takes a downturn when Raghuvendra (Kunal Kapoor), a film producer for whom she breaks up with her childhood sweetheart, gets engaged to someone else. Her landlord turns her out of her apartment because the building association wants to rent apartments only to married couples. All this plus dissatisfaction with her prospects at work serves as a catalyst for her shift to Goa, where she now has to grudgingly live with her parents (Aban Deohans and Atul Kale) with whom she has some issues. She ends up spending many sleepless nights in unhappiness and uncertainty.While in Goa, she seeks out Dr. Jehangir ""Jug"" Khan (Shah Rukh Khan), a psychologist, for her insomnia, after inadvertently having heard him talk at a Mental Health Awareness Conference."
" Story
",2017-08-15 00:00:00,10,"After 3 Idiots this is the far best movie i have ever watched of Bollywood industry what a story. The writer deserves an Oscar. SRK nailed it this is his career one of the best movie because he did not act he just produced a role, hats off. Wish they can produce more movies like this."
" I couldn't watch more than 25minutes
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,2,I tried to watch it but it was so slow and ordinary that I just had to stop it. My review is based on those 25 dreadful minutes. I will update this review if ever I watch more and if anything changes(I seriously think I won't).Recommendation : Do not watch.
" This is Real! It is truly touching.
",2017-07-20 00:00:00,9,"Many criticized this movie because of all these variables that are truly unimportant. I read a review which calls Akira a pig...how? The review told she should blame her past, when she wears ""hip"" clothes and goes out and parties. I completely disagree. She went to therapy because of the loss of the love she got in her childhood. She is young and can wear what she wants (clothes don't define you). Her going out and drinking do not reflect off the main issue that character is facing, in fact, it is more of a distraction from her problem. This movie was just showing how someone's past affects someone and why therapy shouldn't be looked down upon when it is one the most helpful thing you can ever do. This movie is judged somewhat harshly but is so real. There is nothing bubbly/fake/ditsy about it. Sure it has some cliché scenes, but then there are scenes that will make you ponder about our life itself. MUST WATCH!"
" Horrible movie
",2017-07-08 00:00:00,1,because of good reviews I started watching on Netflix. Got so bored and stopped. Then I thought I should watch till end to whats good about this movie. I just cant stand this stupidity. Horrible movie. Read the story in wiki. Just because her parents left her at her grandparents Alia is scarred for life!! like really? I was in same position. I don't feel same way. Alia has acted horrible. SRK OK for whatever role he had. I didn't get why Alia's parents tolerated her all along. I would have shown the door.
" Alia & SRK shine in an uneven film
",2017-05-06 00:00:00,7,"When Dear Zindagi was released, it got good reviews here in India and my frds were all gaga about. When I finally saw the film, a good two weeks after release, it reminded me a about Haider.Haider based on Hamlet was a difficult film to watch because of one - the blood and gore and two - the uneven writing. But that got compensated by Shahid & Tabu's award winning performances. I saw the same issues with Dear Zindagi. Gauri Shinde trying to capture the restlessness of a young girl who does a lot of abstract things in her life but the writing was not upto the mark making me wonder what was happening all the time. Alia tries her best like Shahid but the 1st half was I felt too much for the audience to grasp.It the entry of SRK towards the end of 1st half that the movie rises. And the writing is brilliant from here. SRK's character not only brings peace to Alia's life but to me as audience. Its here that Alia shines and proves that she is the next big thing in Bollywood. She and SRK take grip of the movie. Her performance is fanstatic through out the film but in the 1st half at times I could not connect with her because of the writing. The 2nd half you understand her and accept her faults and weakness.SRK is a revelation. I tell people that he is a fine actor who wasted 10 years of his career playing useless roles in Chopra and Johar productions. Finally, he plays his age and the guy with a beard looks fabulous. He so natural that it difficult to believe that SRK is playing this role.The rest of the cast are fine and the film has lovely soulful music. And, Goa is looks mind blowing and amazing. Most movies capture the party scene of Goa. This movie shows the true beauty of the Goa.Hindi movies are known to have poor 2nd halves. Dear Zindagi is rare film. It has I say an average 1st half and great 2nd half. A good Sunday watch."
" mediocre time passer
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,5,"I usually get the feeling that a 14 year old girl has written the script when I watch a Bollywood movie. The idea of this movie was good, and her problem was real. Being abandoned as a child can affect you in ways you can't imagine, spoiled, mean and self-conscious are only some of them, so the movie was fine in portraying her as a selfish and bitter girl. Aalia was fine, SRK was great, but lots of other things were wrong with this movie and they cannot be ignored.For example, we're supposed to believe that she is a brilliant cinematographer while we see nothing of her brilliance even though there are lots of opportunities for them to be shown. The other one was that any guy she met would go head over heels for this girl, what was that about? One would take her to the once-in-a-lifetime- opportunity kinda job at his own risk to New York just because she's hot; the other one would write music about her even though they've just met? And the part with Pink Floyd's first album, which is so precious to me because it was the only album with Syd Barrett as the lead, was pointless and stupid, disrespecting a legend by mentioning his album outta nowhere and not even bother playing one song? And the end was unaccountable. Everyone applauding her for a below average short film, and even a disaster with someone as supposedly talented and experienced as her!!!Overall I found it worth watching, especially for SRK's performance and the only good dialogues of the film. It's not the best movie of the year, it certainly wasn't the worst; just a mediocre time passer with an interesting subject that could've been much much much better."
" Dear Zindagi...
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,8,"Meet Kaira, a complicated girl. Sometimes you feel she is cute and funny and lovely and what she does is right. Sometimes you feel what's wrong with her! Kaira has problems just like every other human being. She wants to get out of her problems but doesn't know what she should do. Enter Dr. Jehangir Khan i.e. Sharukh Khan. I don't know what others felt about the relationship between Kaira and Dr. Jehangir but for me it was kind of Father-Daughter relationship! For Jehangir, Kaira was just like a child who doesn't know what's wrong with her and why she was behaving as different. He tries to help her through his various stories and techniques. He was like a father trying to teach her daughter what world is and how to live in it. Accept what your heart likes and discard what your heart doesn't like. Beautifully shot film in the backdrop of scenic Goa. Good story. Alia and Sharukh acted very well in their respective roles. Overall a nice touching film with some beautiful messages to remember."
" Dragged on and on and on and on
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,3,"In a nutshell, DEAR ZINDAGI was much ado about nothing. I regretted buying the DVD. What a let down especially for a Shahrukh Khan film.First the plus points: Alia Bhatt acted very well. I wonder if she is like that in real life! Shahrukh Khan acted his usual superb way, he really is a class actor, if anything he was the saving grace for this feeble plot. Goa was depicted as the pretty and picturesque place that it certainly is. The cinematography was good.Now for the bad bit: What really failed was the plot which went on and on and on and on to the point of boredom. There was no need to drag the story out to such an extent.The story also does not really connect, and would in fact connect only with a small metropolitan audience. To begin with, millions of Indians are migrant workers domestically and in the Gulf, so as to provide their families with a better standard of living. They all leave their families behind, often for years. Those left behind kids do not have the luxury of suffering from anxiety syndrome and personality disorders as depicted for Alia Bhatt. Those kids do not have the luxury of seeking a therapist. Those kids just have to get on with life and make the best of it. In all probability those kids do not even think that they have a personality disorder just because their parents left them behind to earn a better living!To summarise, this was a boring film that could have been made much shorter."
" A terrible movie in first-half, gets a bit better later
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,6,"First 40 mins show a young girl who doesn't understand the nuances of sentiments, feelings and relationships and that's fine. But, trying to portray her own world of thoughts where she is right for everything she did and just not trying to figure out what she did wrong, or what she didn't do right. What are we trying to convey here?Her conversations with her parents are over the top and unwarranted. The next 20 mins and her initial conversation with the therapist are bizarre. A therapist in the real world doesn't talk and behave like that.1 hour into the movie and I'm asking myself - ""Do I have the patience to watch it till the end?"". But, as it keeps going, it gets a little better as they show the girl's past and adds some justice to her actions but nonetheless, it's a bit too late."
" Alia Bhatt's hairy side burns...!!!
",2017-02-03 00:00:00,10,"I mean the movie was really good I understood 100%, Alia could had worked better on her emotional scenes towards the end when she was leaving Dr Jehangir 's house she looked absolutely pathetic as if her laughter was going to come out...lol im sure everybody must had noticed that, and the other bit was when Alia Bhatt falls over the sofa, and Shahrukh Khan didn't here the bang and looks left right when she falls right in front him...you can clearly tell Shahrukh khan was acting which these things spoil it for me, might not for everyone...but i can seriously say I really enjoyed the movie...I mean kajols mona brow and Alia Bhatt's hairy side burns, I was like is this for real do hairy Mary's still exist in bollywood...lol lol i mean Alia Bhatt's side burns was more than her male Co stars, has the trend of waxing threading and laser finished in bollywood... Anyhow I enjoyed the movie very much...but can not really praise anyone's acting individually cause I saw a lot of flaws In the actors ability especially Alia even though she was still good, but the singer Ali Zafar's acting shines out the rest..."
" Over the Top Bad
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,1,"Bollywood women are either: a. touchy-feely damsels (way past their college-going years, but shown as attending college anyways) who need to be wooed into loving, and once smitten, dance their pounds off with their rhythmic bosom and hip heaves - or b. ""modern"" gals who apparently have no qualms with being sexually promiscuous.Now that Bollywood has emerged from the apparent deep, dark pit of women being nothing more than a showcase adornment for the heroes in the film, they've gone all-out to find themselves on the other end of the ""no-holds-barred"" spectrum. It's a quantum leap, Bollywood-style. Needless to say, most women protagonists in this film are of the latter variety.For once, would be nice if the makers decided to center the film around someone whose normalcy doesn't stretch the limits of imagination, someone who actually manages to cultivate a respectful relationship without simultaneously gulping down alcoholic shots and casually tossing themselves from one guy to the next."
" A beautiful film that shines through it's brilliant acting
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,10,"One of the best movies of 2016 for sure.There is a simplicity and originality in the film that stays with you hours after you've watched the movie. Alia Bhatt shines as an actress, giving yet another outstanding performance that leaves you speechless. She dives into her character with ease and conviction and ticks all the right boxes delivering an emotional performance.Can't wait to see more of her films soon.A genuine actor who is a superstar.And then there is King Khan. Shah Rukh Khan plays a perfect support both to on-screen kaira and off-screen alia in the role of Jehangir. It was very cool of Srk to do this film and we are left feeling even we need a mentor/guru like Jehangir. It's the chemistry between Alia and Srk that keeps the film moving and the audience involved.The soundtrack is brilliant.Good supporting actors and cinematography. Great work by writer-director Gauri Shinde. A must-watch for sure."
" Everyone makes mistakes
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,7,"I was waiting to watch this film for ages. I finally got the chance to watch it yesterday. I loved Gauri Shinde's previous film English Vinglish, so I was excited to see this one, especially since it features Shahrukh Khan and Alia Bhatt. The trailer and promos also looked amazing, which made me set higher expectations for this film. The first few parts of the film were enjoyable, but after a while, I had second thoughts. Firsty, I'll just explain the plot.Kaira(Alia) is a promising cinematographer who is having issues in her personal life. Her life is on the lows when she decides to visit a psychologist named Jehangir(Shahrukh). He helps her resolve her problems and shows her a new perspective on life. The story may sound simple, but it has a lot of elements to it in the film. I'm going to start with the performances. Alia Bhatt is a truly gifted and natural actress. Her previous performances in Highway and Udta Punjab were outstanding. In this film, however, she hasn't been able to grasp her character with her whole heart, which is disappointing. I have to admit that I was really annoyed by her character at moments, especially when she broke up with Sid(Angad Bedi) who really liked her and when she was being rude to her parents. Okay, her parents abandoned her for a while, but that doesn't mean she has to hold a grudge for the rest of her life. Everyone makes mistakes. Therefore, everyone needs a second chance. Nonetheless, she did a pretty good job. SRK, however, was spectacular as Dr Jehangir Khan. I loved his character and the way he portrayed him was flawless. The supporting cast consisting of Kunal Kapoor, Angad Bedi, Ira Dubey and Ali Zafar were great. The screenplay was a bit weak, as it wasn't engaging enough to keep the audience glued to their seats. Music is pleasing to the ears. My personal favourites are 'Tu Hi Hai' and 'Just Go To Hell Dil'. Cinematography was decent. Editing could have been better. Overall, one thing I really have to appreciate about this film is that it leaves you with a message that we should always treasure good memories and enjoy the little bits of happiness in life. Another important lesson is that you don't have to choose the difficult option in life. If you are having a hard time coping with yourself, this film will give you some inspiration."
" Even some documentaries are interesting than this psychological torture
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,4,"Given 4 stars only for SRK. Felt comfort only with the screen presence of SRK. Utterly boring, fake characterizations.I am ready to accept some offbeat movies and content based ones. Take Tamasha, Pink, Jolly LLB, Udta Punjab etc But, could watch only in bits & pieces. Thank my stars for missing this in theaters.Nearly, 50 mins in to the movie, i did not find anything worth remembering.I can say confidently, some of the documentaries are far more engrossing than this psychological torture.Bottom line is that i don't understand this movie and the high ratings given for this."
" Srk Is Back!

" What this movie really is and about ... !? Surreal.
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,1,"A REAL PIECE OF SH** ! THE WORLD OF Clichés, ARTIFICIALITY AND FAKE-NESS. Faaaaaaaaaaaar away from Reality! Nothing even close to real!One psychotic, egoistic, self centered and self obsessed girl who want to like what she wants to like and who can't even like the best thing in the world if she isn't in the mood. It's like she is always on periods (yes you can call me chauvinist). And one Great! The Best! World's best and very (so-called unique) psychiatrist who can achieve the different and be like no other (This is what SRK has always wanted to be and still look for (watch interviews and observe closely if you want to confirm)).This is the worst acting Alia has done!Karan Johar is one of the ""Father of Clichés"" a;long with ""SRK; almost the daddy of Clichés in Bollywood"" and you know when they both combine and their productions and directions combine to work it's the WORLD OF Clichés !!!! Artificiality and UN-realism on peaks! They are just there to fool the janta and we are so dumb that we fall into their bull damn fu**ing shits!"
" A film that'll fill you with positive energy!
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,10,"Before I begin to write anything about the film, I must state my regret of watching it quite a long time into its release. If I'd read about it and known what the plot revolves around, I sure wouldn 't have taken this long. This is my type of film, because amongst my family, friends and even random strangers, I was for a long time known as an ""Off-label"" psychologist, a friend for problems, till, sadly, very recently when I myself ran into adrenal insufficiency. So I've problems of my own, aplenty actually. Ah' I miss those days, solving people's problems and calming them down to allow them think rationally.... The world is in dearth of people who listen to other 's problems.So here is me suffering from a sub-clinical depression due to my hypothyroidism not being treated with the sufficient dose, due to the thyroid medicine worsening adrenal problems. So it's like going in unending circles, but minutes after finishing this film I was playing with my nieces, chasing them around in the rooms! That's the effect it had on me!A breath of fresh air from Bollywood, although that doesn't mean they haven't been making good films of late. It's just the theme that it deals with that isn't that mainstream in that industry. ""Brain, after all, is a part of the human body"" and it is perfectly normal for it to ""Fall ill"". This, these words had the most ever-lasting effect and from then on it becomes a ride, an experience, a film that I feel every viewer would in one way or the other, one incident or happening or the other, feel building a personal connection with him/her; simply because we've all suffered from it at some point in our lives, but just feel afraid of expressing it. So we feel that a film like this does what we wanted to do ourselves but held ourselves back from expressing it. Sometimes it is an underlying illness or hormonal imbalance, sometimes stress at home, work or personal life triggers it, or sometimes even a medicine that you take that might be causing you bouts of depression, but the point stands that depression and anxiety exist as illnesses, just like cancer, tumours and organ failures do. I could picture two very close persons in my mind whilst watching the film upon whom the film would fit 80 to 90%, but therein again lies the greatness of this film. It visits every household.Alia Bhatt was fantastic in her role. This is her territory and she nails it to be honest. Her past performances in 'Highway' (2014) or 'Udta Punjab' (2016) make it obvious to the film-makers whom to cast for such a role, but I thought this was quite an unusual role for Shah Rukh Khan and he was brilliant in it. He is for a reason amongst the very best of Bollywood's products. A highly capable man!The film-makers must be commended for building the connection between things. First it all appears to be confusing as a lazy girl goes about her life in a very careless manner, disrespecting people, and losing people and relations, and then a connection is built between her present and her past. Most likable and emotional thing of course was the bit about the drawings that she would draw for her parents. Despite having never been able to study all these aspects of childhood in life, I self-teach myself about things through the Internet and here too,... whenever my nieces bring me a drawing of theirs, even if randomly drawn lines, I'd examine it with them in details and ask them what it is etc. The third thing to love was the bit about her parents of course. No matter who bad they were or are, they're your parents. Respect them, talk to them, spend time with them, express your issues and loves and that'll magically improve the quality of your life. Not for them, but for yourself. Our most natural state is to love them, and by turning away from them we punish ourselves, and them too.All in all, a must watch film for anyone reading this. This film will surprise you and make you realise the value of life. Go for it!"
" Flawed yet worth watching.
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,7,"Gauri Shinde's 'English Vinglish' was way better than Dear Zindagi. Yet Dear Zindagi is a good movie not because of the story or the screenplay but due to the stellar performance of Alia Bhatt. She compensates for the weaknesses of the movie. The topic of the movie is quite unique which may be the biggest plus point that this movie has. Also, it is to see that SRK has accepted this role and considered to play the supporting actor because he seems to be perfect for the role of Jahangir Khan and I expect to see the same old SRK- the actor more in the future. One of the things that I disliked about this movie is the editing. The movie could have easily shortened by 10-15 minutes. The therapy sessions between Kaira and Jag are good but at times Jag seems to be quite preachy. This movie is not for everyone. If you love entertaining masala movies stay away from this movie. Mental Stress is a major issue today and it is a good thing that Gauri Shinde has tried to highlight this issue in this movie. Overall this is not a flawless movie but still is a good one."
" Emotional Roller-coaster; Fantastic Piece of Cinema
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,10,"I bought a ticket to this movie on a whim. Knowing nothing about the premise or the actors, I went in blind with no real expectations outside of ""this feels like it would be a romantic comedy."" I came out of the theaters completely floored. The film was an emotional roller-coaster, in which the audience was able to commiserate with, celebrate alongside, and root for Kaira, the protagonist. The characters were solidly built, very consistent, and were a lot of fun to watch in interaction. Flashbacks were unobtrusive, and actually served the purpose of building characters out, rather than simply drawing the movie out. Cinematically stellar, purposeful, and nuanced; something that people from all cultures can enjoy. This film transcends Bollywood, and has themes of love, acceptance, support and the struggles of modern adult romance that we can all appreciate. I can comfortably say that this movie is a well crafted work, and deserves to be listed as an example for Overall, I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a solidly crafted romance film."
" Dear Life!
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,9,"With all the high expectations I watched Dear Zindagi and here's how it went. Let's put it straight. The movie was going nowhere in the very first hour. It felt like a plot less and boring one. Throughout the film even SRK was a co- actor I felt like that Alia was under-shadowed by him. He was, as always actually brilliant. Alia wasn't so devoted to the character she was playing. She failed to pervade herself into Kaira. But then the twist took place. I cannot remember when I watched a film soothing as this in my recent past. It was so appeasing and will gladden your mind. Eventually Dr.Jug will help you to look through your life again from a different perspective. - ----""DON'T LET THE PAST BLACKMAIL YOUR PRESENT TO RUIN A BEAUTIFUL FUTURE!""-----"
" Dear Zindagi is a 2 and half hours psychotherapy session which actually works.A feel good movie with brilliant performances and Direction.
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,8,"Dear Zindagi (2016): Gauri Shinde is considered as one of the best female directors of Indian Cinema even though she has directed only single film English Vinglish which garnered critical acclaim.I loved English Vinglish and it is one of the best Indian movies.So i had huge expectations on Gauri Shinde and Dear Zindagi raised my expectation with its casting itself.Trailers looked promising and Love You Zindagi song is so pleasant.So how is this Dear Zindagi?Plot:Kaira (Alia Bhatt),a budding talented cinematographer has happy life in her professional career but personally her romantic life is so messy.She doesn't know what the life means and importance of relationships.A chance encounter with Jehangir Khan (Sharukh Khan), an unconventional thinker and psychiatrist, helps her gain new perspective about life.Plus Points:1)Performances: Alia Bhatt is brilliant in her role of Kaira.The preternaturally talented Bhatt plays Kiara with defiant pluck, a shy girl over correcting for her insecurity, lashing out before she's lashed at.There are times the performance appears showy, but the actress brings such a raw, earnest vulnerability to her highly flawed character that she remains compelling throughout.We have rarely seen Khan not angling for a girl, and he shines here as he exhorts his young charge toward revelation while backing away from conversational and cinematic spotlight.Modesty might not be a color familiar to him, but Mr Khan wears omniscience lightly and majestically.His screen presence is magical.Supporting cast is good too.2)Screenplay and Direction: Gauri Shinde did not select any inspirational subject like English Vinglish but here she chose a teen drama with philosophical touch.She brilliantly showcased all the present problems faced y youth and their mental illness.Dear Zindagi is like a visual heart touching psychotherapy session for youth.Shinde might be the most celebratory feminist among our mainstream filmmakers, her heroines far from being defined or restrained by men.3)Music: Music is heart warming and Background score is brilliant.Love u Zindagi song is so good with simple but provoking lyrics.Minus Points:1)Too classy: Movie is too classy and appeals only to a limited section of urban audience.2)Slow Pace: Especially in second half,screenplay lags at few parts.so,Dear Zindagi is a 2 and half hours psychotherapy session which actually works.A feel good movie with brilliant performances and Direction.My rating 7.5/10"
