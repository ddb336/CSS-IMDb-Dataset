" A feel good film
",2021-04-06 00:00:00,8,"Lovely film of innocence, with a bit of fun thrown in. üôÇ"
" Worth it!
",2021-03-30 00:00:00,7,"Such a great cast and what a cute story! This movie was simple and fun, so well done! I smiled multiple times and so need that in our lives!"
" Bittersweet Romance
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,9,"Barefoot started like a low budget movie depicting common stereotypes about rich young men but once the actual relationship story unfolded it became a tale of love, responsibility and vulnerability like no other.Some relationship scenes made me weep like a child because Barefoot manages to show the pain that lies and separation inflict so that your own suffering from past wounds gets triggered.On the other hand the family and society scenes are so fresh and hilarious that we can reflect on the absurdities of every day life. Some dialogues are priceless!When you want to learn about love and how it develops watch this movie. It's not your typical Hollywood romance. It's rather bittersweet and unless you are made of stone you will have to empathize.I won't give it a 10 because it's not perfect. Sometimes the cinematography looks cheap and conventional and there was an unnecessary violent scene at the end so you can't watch it with kids. Apart from that it's a beautiful story with relatable characters.Even the supporting roles - like the psychiatrist, the parents or the other patients - were meaningful and contributed to the overall impression of a highly humanistic message."
" Evan Rachel Wood is angelic in this quirky Indie road movie
",2020-11-20 00:00:00,6,"The black sheep loser of an affluent family (Scott Speedman) is forced to mop floors at a mental facility while on probation wherein he meets an angelic patient (Evan Rachel Wood). He takes her to Louisiana to meet his family and misadventures ensue. Treat Williams plays the dad and J.K. Simmons the director of the asylum.""Barefoot"" (2014) is an entertaining enough romcom misadventure and part-road movie. Wood is stunning in an innocent, celestial way, but needs to eat some hamburgers. There's a Prodigal Son angle and the movie leaves you with a warm feeling despite some debaucheries in the first half.The film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was shot entirely in Louisiana.GRADE: B-"
" Great cast and songs
",2020-07-15 00:00:00,6,"Performance by David Jenson is just so good and so in the role , I can only imagine once in lifetime that movies cast would give full potential performance like that to make a masterpiece üòÅ"
" A Must For Evan Rachel Wood Fans
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,6,Evan Rachel Wood is splendid in this otherwise uneven rom-com dramedy. The matter-of-factness in which she portrays the innocence of her character is impressive considering she's been in the movie business since the nineties and has probably seen it all. Kate Burton also stands out in a smaller role that is pitch perfect. The script is acceptable for this type of movie; it just lacks that little something extra which would help it rise above the standard romantic comedy.
" Very cute and simple a romantic story!
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,6,Sometimes all you are looking for is a simple story that is about simple people and simple lives. This one is about pure characters who find each other. Don't give a damn to the critics reviews or ratings. Just enjoy this one for a fun filled evening with a glass of wine. You won't regret it!
" A Hidden Jewel!
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,8,"Not real sure why this didn't get a better score on Rotten Tomatoes! I am glad that I watched it anyway! Evan Rachel Wood is one of my favorite actresses ever since I saw her in ""Thirteen"" She is really great at ""feeling"" her character!! She did a perfect job with playing the innocent, sweet, isolated girl that falls in love! Fabulous story! Great job! Must watch, very heartfelt!"
" Heart warming
",2020-03-10 00:00:00,8,"A good movie with elements to keep you glued till the end; means i dint have to look at my watch to figure out how much more is left.Concept is simple and light but what sparkles is the character portrayal, sweet and innocent comedy and sprinkle of emotions in between. Its like director looked in no hurry, he had read the script correct and implemented it to give a more than decent outcome.Saying so, however, the ending could have been better or if i say a bit more raging. That feel good feeling dipped a little there.Anyways, a perfect matinee show with my wife and we both were happy."
" Really?
",2020-02-08 00:00:00,2,"It just doesn't make sence. From the first minute to the last. The actress isn't playing a traumatized woman, but a woman with the mental ability of a 2 year old. The actor plays a jerk of a guy where every woman would walk away from. He takes a mental ill girl to a stripbar and takes her on a trip in questionable clothes, while she ran away, like it's totally normal. Waisted time, this movie."
" Laid back and sweet...Ya gotta watch it!
",2019-12-26 00:00:00,10,"What started with a journey of two very lost people, blossomed into a redefined love story. Each actor portrayed their character with a depth and clarity that intensified throughout the movie.
This was not a big budget production. There were no epic scenes, or sex, or cheesy dialogue. Instead this was a film which gifted a realism I really liked, the simplicity of the story and the calm folksy score creating space for emotion. In the end, it's something we all need...and that's why this earns my recommendation."
" I wanted to like it
",2019-12-04 00:00:00,6,"I wanted to like this movie. I understand the movie, but Evan Rachel Wood's performance was awful. It was so phony. Contrived. Exaggerated. I don't know if it was bad directing, bad writing, or bad acting. Scott Speedman was really good. I would think he should have more roles after this film, but I don't think he has. J.K. Simmons was a great character actor, as usual. Solid. Though Treat Williams doesn't have a significant role, he carries off his part like butter."
" whoa
",2019-11-16 00:00:00,1,I mean this film has 2 dicks .... treat williams and scott speedman who manage to cloud up the picture with their bad decisions so you can't see what is really going on because of the smoke screen .... the nutty girl is a diversion no one can deal with
" Layered and beautiful
",2019-07-11 00:00:00,8,"While there's certainly a few details and plot holes that makes this story implausible, and having someone generous enough to hand out a lot of money, that's where my complaints stop. I love Evan's sweet characterization - it never seems too over the top or insensitive. Scott Speedman's character is more layered than he appears, and I think he plays each of those facets in his character beautifully. They're a great pair, and they both grow smoothly throughout the film. Topped with bright colors, heart-warming moments, and the amazing feat of getting this story to fit in an hour and a half and not feel rushed, I would recommend this. I just wish I could find the songs not already listed on the soundtrack."
" Such a sweet film!
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,10,"Just a sweet different rom com, really liked it! It's just deep enough but not too deep which makes it a nice light hearted movie with more meaning than the usual rom com!"
" so repititive and childish
",2019-03-26 00:00:00,3,I really don know how people can comment passionately about this chick flick . are you really out of your minds or is this the first ever movie you've watched in your whole life ? writer gives no answer to any questions . everything is just miraculously neglected . how they left the hospital ( no securities ? no guards ? with patient cloth and no even a car to get out of the hospital ) ? how they passed the security in airport with no ID ? how he paid the plane ticket while his credit card is declined for buying a bear ?!! how they bought ticket without even knowing her name ??!! how even can anyone finish this movie ??? do we have to just watch a movie for fun ( if there would be any ) ??!!
" Sweet PG film mixed with R-rated nudity and language
",2019-03-21 00:00:00,7,"Conflicting sweet film. Loved the storyline but someone felt compelled to throw in opposite R-rated nudity and language. That ruined it for me...just my opinion. If I'm watching a sweet love story, I'm not too happy to be thrown into a room with mostly unclothed pole dancing strippers. It just doesn't go together for me. If I'm going for the gangster, strip club type film, then I expect those scenes and the language. Ok, enough said about that. Another annoying thing about this film is that I still liked it. Oh, and also, what the heck?! The film clearly was filmed all over Texas but filming locations only say Louisiana...totally offended Texan here!!"
" Ending Could Have Been Better
",2019-03-15 00:00:00,8,"Great movie, could have ended better. Really thought after watching the whole movie, the ending would have been more. It's like the writer got tired and just said end it."
" Don't listen to bad critics
",2019-02-14 00:00:00,9,"Corny and yet heartwarming, and it touches your heart with all the good feelings from watching this nonsense story full of compassion. I wished they how a future scene of how they were doing after the end."
" A Beautiful Film
",2019-01-15 00:00:00,9,"There's something about this movie that ultimately nourishes the soul. If you are open to the unique premise and the offbeat characters it can be very inspiring to watch. The film is really about new beginning for the two main characters, who come from such completely different backgrounds. The story is poignant and switches between modern edginess and old fashioned romance.The actors and director do an amazing job creating a film that is endearing and compelling, without being overly sentimental."
" A Spirited Light and Charmingly Different Comedy
",2019-01-15 00:00:00,9,"4 February 2015. Sometimes there comes along a charming movie that doesn't try to push anything except a finely balanced comedy drama that really offers up embarrassing moments as a result of differences in life. In Barefoot, a jerk in a menial job at a mental hospital ends up with female patient whose persona is both na√Øve, innocent, and wonderful. The comedy is not forced, but results from life dissonances that can make us embarrassed and smile. The drama offered up is practical and serious which makes this movie less of a clich√©, as personally satisfying. The little slice of dramatized life allows us to find redemption and innocence in most all of us."
" Chef d'oeuvre!
",2018-12-24 00:00:00,10,"Dans un genre √©tonnant et inattendu , une grande r√©ussite!"
" Goofy
",2018-11-07 00:00:00,3,She was so irritating I couldn't stand it. A movie for those that don't want to think too much.
" IF YOU GO TO JAIL, WE CAN'T BE TOGETHER
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,7,"Jay (Scott Speedman) likes to drink, gamble, speed, smoke, and go to strip clubs. Unfortunately, even with an MBA he isn't much good at it. On parole, he lands a gig mopping floors at a mental institution. He also has outstanding gambling debts. His family has money as he goes to New Orleans (from LA) to his brother's wedding. Pressed for a date, he opts to take with him newly escaped mental patient Daisy (Evan Rachel Wood). She is child like and honest. She will say anything to anyone and needs to be protected, the type of girl guys easily fall in love with. She doesn't like shoes.This is another quirky romantic comedy. We have entered a downward spiral where each romantic comedy has to be odder than the previous one, irregardless how inane the ending or impossible the situation or how awkward they make us feel while trying to make us feel good.Evan Rachel Ward was delightful in her role, although her scripted character was not convincingly real. Jay is a guy whose character is difficult to connect with, oh poor little rich kid.The film makes for a good rental for lovers of quirky romantic comedies. No sex or nudity, although there are some strip joint scenes, they are in bikinis. I don't recall any F-bombs although rated PG-13 for ""brief strong language."" I may have missed it."
" A charming surprise
",2018-09-17 00:00:00,7,"I started watching this and thought that I could almost write the script about boy taking home unsuitable girl for family reunion. The beginning was almost just too stereotypical. But as the plot unfolded it was a lot gentler and didn't go for the cheap laughs but concentrated more on the nature of relationship and family. 
The acting and dialogue was good without being great.
What I thought was going to be a silly farce turned instead into a well-crafted love story with some thought-provoking jabs along the way.
Not earth-shattering but a very pleasant diversion"
" An RV Adventure
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,6,"1. ""Romantic Comedy,"" sometimes, little comedy, some romance; 2. It's really not plausible that any woman anywhere could be as dimwitted as the star of this film; 3. It's really not plausible that any guy could relate to a woman who is as dimwitted as the star of this film; 4. OK, some moments of comedy; 5. Reality destroys the ""romance"" at an inopportune time; 6. Hey, let's go on an RV adventure and little Miss Barefoot is on her own -- wait, the guy has a change of heart -- and saves Miss Barefoot; 7. The RV adventure continues, but, comes to an unfortunate end; 8. I would have stopped watching, but, Miss Barefoot kept my interest."
" A great heartwarming and funny love story.
",2018-06-25 00:00:00,9,"I may like love stories, but some of the ones I've seen are pretty clich√©. But this one is different. Instead of a man seeing a woman walking down a street or working at a store, it's a man working as a janitor at a looney place and safe a woman's life from a creep and the woman followed him but never been on the outside world. When I watched it for the first time, I couldn't stop laughing and loving this brilliant movie. I love how when they continue their journey on the road they ended up falling in love with each other and called themselves a couple. If you want a different love story, this might be the one for you to watch and love."
" They just don't make em like this anymore....but they should
",2018-06-12 00:00:00,9,"Barefoot is a different kind rom-com, but it is a rom-com none the less. It uses themes most wouldn't normally think of when writing a rom-com but it works none the less mental health is always a serious issue and remains so in this movie. The main actors in the movie I'd never heard of before but both give strong and convincing performances. I like the story line along with the twist that really makes the movie that much better. I have now watched it somewhere around 10 times and will watch several more times I'm sure. If you want a movie you can watch with your family or to help with the setting for a date night this will work. One of the best I've seen it just works."
" I wanted to like it, I really did.
",2018-05-03 00:00:00,6,"Ok, so the male lead became infatuated with a sweet young and na√Øve girl who sees good in him, basically because she doesn't know any better after being locked away first in her Mother's house, and then in a mental institute.Call me old fashioned, but I would have liked to have seen some signs of growth in him, but there really was none. I don't consider him continuing to game the system so he can be with his GF as any kind of growth.Not even an apology to his parents, especially his dad.
Am I suppose to believe that when the newness and excitement wears off in this new relationship, he won't go back to his ways with strippers and gambling? Why?
Sure, playing the white knight to a troubled girl is fun at first, but it won't be long when he has to put on his big boy pants and actually take care of another adult human being. What fun is that to a guy like this?She is basically a child in a woman's body, and I don't want to think too much on that because then the movie takes on a really creepy vibe. But her being like this makes his irresponsibility seem fun and exciting; an adventure that she wants to go on forever and ever! He is basically the parent who will let her eat candy and junk, skip all responsibility and just do whatever seems fun every day, and if his dad doesn't want to pay for that, well then we can always just steal from him!
People are who they are until they prove otherwise. I see a world of hurt in her future with him.It wasn't a bad movie though, and I enjoyed some of it. I just felt let down when it was done."
" Simple movie about love
",2017-11-27 00:00:00,7,"What I mean by simple is that the story is easily understood, doesn't take too many turns that we might miss and be lost in the middle of the story. It is pretty straightforward and even heartwarming sometimes.The acting is magnificent and Rachel Wood steals the limelight from the very first moment she appears on-screen. The whole movie depicts love and life in a way that we don't usually see being portrayed by Hollywood but one that is much more sincere and natural than the usual passion route most movies take. It is quite easy to enjoy this movie and having watched this by chance on TV, I'm glad I came across it."
