" A Modern horror classic
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,8,"I am always incredibly impressed with how well some people can tell a story with such little dialogue.'The Eyes of My Mother' is one of those films that creates a truly brooding and tense atmosphere. There are a lack of truly gripping horror movies nowadays. This film does not rely on cheap tactics such as jump scares (in fact, not a single one in the entirety).Subtle storytelling aspects, stunning cinematography and effects, and a perfect score really help create a depressing and frightening atmosphere.A modern horror classic."
" ""The Eyes of My Mother""
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,10,The main character embodies the real face of evil and was quite unnerving to watch. One of best horror movies I've seen in recent years. It's very underappreciated so please check it out.
" Not to be treated like splatter horror
",2020-10-14 00:00:00,9,"The black and white effect. Some say its because the horror of the film would be overblown by blood and screaming color. Maybe. I would say being filmed in black and white is also because its what in inside this girl. Color is emotion and she doesn't see life in color. She has no color in her. And that emptiness, that black and white bleakness, is something she has no capacity to change - but she keeps trying.This film terrorizes on a level of simple reality. A true killer can just be someone who only 'feels' when they kill. And that is fleeting. The perfect 'friend' is someone who can't respond, someone who is under her complete control, whether dead or alive.Raised in a void of emotion, she was taught from the earliest age that death and pain is only biology. Add to that seeing her mother murdered and that she possibly killed her father, (shades of sexual abuse there, lifetime or just after the mother was gone?) and you have a perfect meld of someone who will do anything just to feel... anything.And that can leave you with a unsettled shocked feeling, as you've glimpsed a desperation that you realize can exist where you least expect it."
" Pyscho brutality ..Disturbing !
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,2,"Life means nothing to her ..she's lonely and tortures those unlucky
souls who encounter her. We see we try to get it .We see all that makes us sickened and are left kinda in a shocking pain.The Eyes .is as dark as it gets ..worth seeing if you can handle it not for the squemish and the brave will come away disturbed."
" Exquisitely dark, engulfing and disturbing
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,8,"Not many films take my breath away and leave me in a stunned silence, however, this film has done exactly that. The Eyes of My Mother is a very unsettling watch, you dread what is to come and literally cringe at the progression. I was very surprised to find that this was Nicolas Pesce's debut film, one would expect a film of this candour to come from a Director of some length of experience. The visuals are striking and completely suck you into the seemingly vast onscreen experience.The young Francisca is being raised on a rural farm in Portugal. Her mother teachers her various surgical procedures including how to remove eyes. She shows Francisca the lens from an eyeball and explains how we see the world through this small biological marvel.A tragic encounter with a murderous stranger sparks a series of events that shatter Francisca's world. She turns from an innocent young girl, following the path of a happy life, into a girl whose head is turned to a dark, depraved desire to learn about a world that includes psychotic obsession and brutal, violent behaviour.A memorable watch with visuals that will stay with you long afterwards. Not for the faint-hearted, but horror fans will soak it up like a sponge."
" Truly Horrifying
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,8,"""The Eyes of My Mother"" is not a horror movie in the usual sense that we're used to. Something isn't quite right about the protagonist, Francisca, but can we really figure out exactly what it is? Mr. Serial Killer gets more than he bargained for and, OH, please remember not to indulge in one night stands or pick up hitchhiking strangers! The pace is intentionally slow, so go ahead and settle into the uncomfortableness of it. What you don't see is almost more disturbing than what you do see. This movie is truly horrifying, because there are people like Francisca out there."
" Should have been a short story.
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,4,"This is waaaay to long and boring. There were too many times where I asked, ""what just happened?"" The best review for this movie is titled, ""A Prententious and Painfully Slow Horror Film."" Just search for that and be done with reviews."
" THE BEST HORROR FILM I'VE EVER SEEN
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,10,It was one of the best horror films I've ever seen. If anyone wants to see something different the common killing and usual stuff then I highly recommend this movie. It's incredible
" Boring, ""Lynch Wanna Be"" Fails to Deliver
",2020-07-12 00:00:00,4,"I've never written a negative review. I guess there's a fist time for everything.David Lynch's ""Eraserhead"" (1977) was a groundbreaking horror film due to its creativity and ""otherworldliness"". Lynch's direction solicits the viewer's empathy for the main character despite his remarkably bizarre life. It's a fascinating, unconventional work of cinematic art that transports the viewer through heretofore unimaginable events.""The Eyes of My Mother"" (2016), which seems stylistically influenced by Lynch's work (even using black & white film) comes off as an overly morose, boring ""Lynch wanna be"" production; artless in its execution and unable to even obliquely capture my interest. What little plot there is seems exhaustingly simpleminded (instead of stylistically austere). Just try to think as a 13 year old boy would and you'll be able to predict where the film is going.The best part of the film is that it's only 1:16 long."
" Where are those air sickness bags?
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,2,"A tedious, disgusting descent into amoral cruelty and fado-inflamed sadism. I think the director must be a misanthrope. This is a film designed to trash the human spirit. Watch it if you wish to be both bored and nauseated at the same time."
" Probably one of the most terrifying psychological thrillers I've ever seen.
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,8,"One of the most disturbing and uncomfortable movie experiences for me in years. Perverse, yet completely morbidly plausible. I feel bad for this innocent child who grows up and later becomes isolated and accustomed to being twistedly fixated on her dead parents, then on to murdering senselessly. It just gets so, so much worse.. Kudos for disturbing me!"
" Horror flick or art film
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,3,"First thing that makes me say wtf is after about a minute in and you realize this is in black and white. (boring) Next, theres virtually no talking in the film. Raimi, or another horror producer should remake this, and add a lot of gore, music score, and make it in color. I like that theres no FX. The photography is good also. It goes on and on though because of those reasons."
" I loved it, and I hate myself for doing so.
",2020-02-17 00:00:00,10,"The movie has an overall IMDb score low, and I can iimagine why, but it´s worth watching regardless. The events do feel real (if you have lived your whole life in the city you might find it hard to, but they could actually have happened), it is slow paced but we hardly see any repetition on screen ... But I must warn you: it deals with some themes that some people might see as disturbing, and it can trigger some weird feelings. Anyway, do as you will! This is a once in a lifetime experience for slow burn horror movies lovers like me!
ps: if you´re into that sort of Anabelle, Paranormal Activity or any other mainstream horror movies you´ll probably hate it"
" What a unique film! Glad I watched it
",2020-02-05 00:00:00,8,"I'm not giving away ANYTHING to this unusual thriller but I will say this. It's not for everyone and it is not for the squeamish. I had to look away for an early scene. But... if you decide to watch it and stick with it, you will probably not be disappointed. It is one you won't soon forget and unlike many films of this genre, the ending was PERFECT!!! Absolutely spot on!!!"
" Concise art-house horror
",2020-01-28 00:00:00,9,"The Eyes of My Mother is a beautiful looking piece of horror, and the Director was correct to cast in in B/W. He loves the unusual camera frame. Throughout the movie different angles are tried, and it is this willingness to push boundaries that makes Eyes so appealing. The horror is dark indeed, but the filmmaker spares us anything too graphic. This too is successful. It all adds up to intrigue. We are fascinated to know where everything is heading. It's a short film, about 75 minutes on my clock, which is perfect. Very chilly and dark horror."
" Sleepy time I guess
",2020-01-27 00:00:00,1,This movie is so pointless. Not only did it drag on but the ending was anticlimactic. Really boring and I don't know how most of these reviews say that it is disturbing. In other words this movie is meh.
" Loneliness can do strange things to the mind.
",2020-01-02 00:00:00,7,"A spooky, dark and disquieting tale of love, loss and corrupted innocence. Stylish, beautiful, and unnerving."
" Turds come in black and white too!
",2019-12-13 00:00:00,2,I M a lover of disturbing films. This movie is disturbing all right- disturbingly awful. It makes no sense. The lead actress was ok I guess this movie makes the Human Centipede 2 look like Gone With the Wind. If you want a disturbing de don't black and white film black see the Lighthouse. Ignore the high reviews because the reviewers must have been high!
" Dare to see
",2019-11-11 00:00:00,7,"Impressive opera prima by a New Yorker fascinated with Portuguese fados and body parts. It works very well until section 3 (III. Family), when the movie gets away from Nicolas Pesce's hands. Disbelief was handled effectively in the first two sections, but in this third and final movement all probability, plausibility or credibility of the situation went out the window (even within the horror genre), and the tale's dénouement is way too fast and facile. A bit more of scriptwork was needed. Still this is a good motion picture, although a bit unconfortable to watch in a few moments, but I would not tell you not to see it."
" Excellent!
",2019-11-02 00:00:00,8,"This is not a film for everyone, but for me this is an instant classic! The B/W really adds to the atmospheric creepiness. The acting is solid, and the story is really original. If you are a true Horror fan, i say you need to watch this film!"
" The Eyes of My Mother (2016)
",2019-10-31 00:00:00,7,"Directed by Nicholas Pesce. Starring Kika Magalhães, Will Brill, Olivia Bond, Paul Nazak, Clara Wong, Diana Agostini, Fiora Diaz, Joey Curtis-Green. (R)Stark, sinister story of isolated, traumatized girl (Bond as a child, Magalhães as an adult) whose values are so compromised (to say the least) and curiosities so disturbing, that she's capable of horrors that feel vividly real and outlandish in the same venomous breath. To say more would spoil the disquieting surprises, but it's rare for evil to be witnessed in such confused, guileless terms that one questions the true definition of ""evil"" (nature vs. nurture?). Not for all tastes, to be sure, and certainly not the squeamish--there's not much blood-and-guts gore to see, but plenty is implied, primarily through the nauseating use of sound. The presentation is chilling and matter-of-fact, though the particulars of the story logic are fable-esque; more background would have helped, and there are too many irrational leaps to take, especially when the timeline shifts ahead several years on multiple occasions. Despite that significant flaw, the film is still capable of lingering, nightmare-inducing power. The Stygian shadows cast from the black & white photography make some sections of the film feel like they're being transmitted from the depths of an abyss.73/100"
" Stopped half way cause wad faling asleep

Cause of the quite high ratings i keer watching an hour Hoping this was maybe Some surprisingly different horror Movie . But iT wasnt :
" Unique female serial killer flix
",2019-08-23 00:00:00,8,The making of a serial killer. The entire movie is in black and white but well made. The actors are not well known but they all do a superb job of portraying the ramifications of a series of disturbing events that catapult the main actress into madness. I've never seen a horror movie like this one and I never want to rewatch it but I am glad it's off my list. 8 stars for originality.
" This movie is very disturbing
",2019-08-08 00:00:00,7,The context of all the Heinous crimes and murders is well brought. But by God is it disturbing .
" A Dark Slo-Mo Pretty Cool Movie - No Real Visible Horror - Definately No Thriller
",2019-05-12 00:00:00,8,05/12/2019 Just a cool movie about the seclude life of a child through her adulthood. Family and friends always leave her. Bon Appetit
" Resorted to fast-forwarding, and still nothing happened
",2019-04-12 00:00:00,1,"No idea why anyone would rate this movie above a 3. Fortunately it was short, and even shorter when I started to fast-forward it in an attempt to find a scene that was remotely entertaining. I didn't. If there was a 'stupid' genre, this movie would be solidly in it. Nothing about it makes any sense, and it doesn't even contain any good gore. As far as being scary - my reflection is way scarier. Avert your eyes people. There is absolutely nothing to see here."
" Haunting Look at the Effects of Isolation
",2019-04-10 00:00:00,8,"This film I heard about through podcasts I listen to. I actually saw the writer/director Nicolas Pesce next film before checking this one out. To get into my review, the synopsis is a young, lonely woman is consumed by her deepest and darkest desires after tragedy strikes her quite country life.We kick this film off with a woman walking in the road. A semi is approaching and honks at her. She just falls to the ground while the driver gets out and checks on her. It then shifts to a young girl, Francisca (Olivia Bond), with her mother, Diana Agostini. Her mother was a surgeon back in Portugal and now she is raising her daughter. She is teaching her medical things with some of their cows as well as procedures. Their world turns upside down though when Charlie (Will Brill) shows up at their farm. Francisca's father, Paul Nazak, comes home and Charlie has killed his wife. The father knocks him out.This is where things get a little bit odd. The father chains up Charlie in the barn and they bury the mother in the woods by their house. They just carry on like life is normal. One night, Charlie is yelling and father tells to take care of it. She does and not in a way that I was expecting.It then jumps some time into the future. Francisca has grown up to be Kika Magalhães. Her father has passed away, but she still is keeping him in the house. She is carrying on like nothing happened. She does break down though and is lonely. She then decides to try to find a companion, which takes to some even darker turns.Now I definitely wanted to go somewhat vague with this recap, as to not spoil things. This film though really is quite basic in the story though. There aren't a lot of parts to it. What really carry this though are some other things. The first of which is the location. This is actually quite interesting as I grew up in the country. It can be eerily quiet, so things that happen in this could without anyone knowing. Going even farther, I feel like the world moved on while Francisca kind of stayed the same. The house isn't modern and their vehicle isn't either. We don't really know when this film is taking place, which adds to this.Something else is that this film really has good writing. What gets established early on is referenced back to later. I'm a big fan when this is done; because I get sucked in by stories so I really like to know me paying attention to all the little details really comes back for a payoff. With saying that, I really wonder if this young girl is really the daughter of these two. They seem quite a bit older than normal parents age which makes me wonder, but also with something that happens in the film.Going from there, the feeling of growing dread is something that I really dug too. The film is slow-burn, which is quite interesting since the film runs less than 80 minutes. The dread that grows as you see this life that Francisca is living and how things that she did as a child and that her father did turned her into what she is. When you see what she does to Charlie and to others it really is not only sad, but quite horrific.What also really drives this film is the acting. I really have to give credit to Magalhães. She has to play a character that is completely devoid of normal human emotions. A lot of this is the isolation that she grew up in. I can't really say that she is insane, because to be honest, she doesn't seem to know right from wrong. Agostini is interesting in her small role as she tries to teach her daughter things. Nazak is cold toward her and some of things he teachers her take her on a different route. I thought the rest of the characters rounded out the film for what was needed.On to the effects of the film, which seem to be practical and I was for that. There aren't really a lot of effects to be honest, but the blood we get definitely looked good. I should point out that the film is filmed in black and white, which is definitely an interesting stylistic choice that I dug. With her living where she does, I think it adds to that for sure. There is a reveal of what happens to someone that really made me go numb with the realism of what was done. I should end this here saying that the film is shot beautifully as well.The soundtrack of the film was interesting. There is a song playing in the first scene that caught my roommate's attention as the song is about a family that was murdered by their father. There are also some old movies that are being played where we get to hear some dialogue. I bring this up as I know they were strategically put in because it goes along with what is happening in the film. I would say that the use of sound and music was solid in this one.Now to wrap this up, I do have to say that I enjoyed this film. I will admit that the story is lacking a bit. It is quite basic, but for a film like this, it didn't need to be more complex. The acting and the pacing of the film really drives it. It built tension in a slower way, but I thought the payoff was good. The effects we got were good and the film was shot beautifully. The soundtrack was good and that is not only with music, but with dialogue from other films as well. I do think this film has some minor issues, but I really liked it and would recommend giving it a viewing. I thought it was good."
" striking visuals and gory writting
",2019-04-05 00:00:00,6,"Wicked, poetic, unsettling and haunting, but never appealing or rewarding enough, The Eyes of My Mother boasts some of the year's finest cinematography but its style-over-substance storytelling, unable to build more layered and engaging character portraits, feels overlong and hollow."
" Solid
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,7,"Very disturbing and suspensful. Shot in black and white. Creepy and unnerving. Performances are above average nothing I'd say is outstanding. Original and creative story but nothing that gives this moving leverage, its so disturbing of a story with a plot thats too simple to give the story its full potential. I wouldn't give it anything over a 7"
" Its not just a film, its art..
",2019-03-03 00:00:00,10,"But Beware, it stays with you for sometime.. its not just a movie to be seen, its an experience to be had. And the way the story portrays loneliness is poetic in a very dark way. THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR YOUR NORMAL CINE GOER.. Its way more than just entertainment."
" Spellbinding
",2019-02-06 00:00:00,8,"Spellbinding tale of an unwell, isolated young woman who has no idea that she's unwell. Just a mesmerizing performance by Kika Magalhães in the lead, and shot in exquisite black and white. It's a very dark, off-putting movie, and it's definitely not for everyone. Director Nicolas Pesce makes great use of the film's short running time (under 80 minutes) and relatively claustrophobic atmosphere. VERY well done."
" Fatuous Tripe
",2019-02-05 00:00:00,3,"This film may come across quite well if you're naive of the likes of Lynch and the Cohen Brothers, but having seen it done SO much better, to me this film is try-hard mindless nonsense.
To get away with this kind of aesthetic and style, you need a compelling plot for it to hang from, so that it acts as dressing as you journey along, absorbed. This film just strings along a lot of ""arty"" shots with a girl with a black bob and enough loose ends to tie you up in frustration at the sheer over-reliance on genre."
" Just for psychopaths
",2018-11-15 00:00:00,1,"Worst movie ever, has no story. It has nothing to do with logic or horror"
" Great character study in a beautiful psychotic film.
",2018-10-20 00:00:00,10,"The Eyes of My Mother is a film that really pay off on many levels. The cinematic art film on one hand. Yet A slasher picture with no attempts at irony. Hauntingly hypnotic. The film is very delicate and precise in it psychotic violence as to be difficult to analyze or describe. I would go so far to say
The Eyes of My Mother is an insightful, meaningful, and exquisitely beautiful horror film, and undoubtedly one of the genre's most important offerings ."
" Movie Review: The Eyes of My Mother (2016)
",2018-10-14 00:00:00,9,"I've seen hardly nothing about this film, all I can say is this is a hidden gem for us horror fans. This is the directorial debut of Nicolas Pesce, who currently is working on the reboot of my favourite J-Horror film Ju-on entitled ""Grudge"". This films stars a cast of unknowns who have done mainly shorts or a variety of small parts in various TV and film, but in this case it pays off. Diana Agostini, Kika Magalhães really shine in this psychological horror film that is a plethora of gothic horror. The film is originally shot in black and white which truly adds to the unsettling nature of what takes place during the entire 76 minute duration. If Norman Rockwell and Edward Gein had a child, it would be THIS film. This is truly Americana in its darkest form.The film starts off with the Diana Agostini and Olivia Bond (who plays a younger Francisca) as her mom was teaching her how to surgically remove eyeballs from the cows, which is quite a disturbing start but it leads the audience into the person she is to become in her later years. Francisca lived isolated on a farmhouse with just her mother and father, cut off from society alot like Gein was when he was growing up. She and her mother were quite close, this closeness effects her as you will see, especially in later scenes. Their close knit bond suddenly comes to a end at the hands of a stranger, allow me to say that this scene is particularly disturbing and resonates with both the audience as well with young Francisca. This act of violence leads the young girl unbeknowningly down a dark path, as she learns about life, love, and death in her own dark way.Years later and now a mature and beautiful woman played by Kika Magalhães, she tries to coexist with society with some horrifying results. The violence in this film is shielded by the lack of colour of the film but that in no way shields the viewer from the horrors and brutality that take place on screen. There is lots of on screen violence and some disturbing imagery that follows all the way until the abrupt and shocking ending. This film shows the death of innocence and the birth of a monster as it unfolds before your very eyes. 
This is not your typical horror genre piece this is definately a indie film that will stick with you long after the credits roll."
" Beautiful little masterpiece
",2018-10-08 00:00:00,9,"This one blew me away. I have seen a LOT of horror and artfilms over the years and this one.... this one truly got me. 
There are elements from Psycho, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and even japanese body horror and it's combined in a black and white artfilm. Truly an indie masterpiece.
The movie is well directed, well acted and beautifylly shooted. Every single charecter in this movie sees him or her surroundings very differently and the main charecter sees the world kind of through ""the eyes of her mother"". 
The movie tells you what happens if you grow up totally without any consept of moral, society or other people."
" Horrible
",2018-08-12 00:00:00,1,"Very depressing, I only watched the first 15 minutes before turning it off. Great if you like morose films."
" Masterpiece
",2018-05-25 00:00:00,10,"Some people do not like categorizing this movie as a horror movie and even though I understand where they come from, I highly disagree. It's not a typical horror movie for sure, but it's a film that will follow you and that stays with you long after you watch it. It is a very disturbing movie, but not in the way that you would think. The entire movie is shot in black and white which only adds to the beauty of it. The director uses black and white to try and ""reinvigorate"" the visual beauty of old movies and to show that black and white can be just as interesting as color (if not more). And it works. The way that it is filmed adds to the story and makes it much more dramatic and gives it an eerie feeling.As simplistic as the plot is, it really does not take away of the beauty of the film. It starts off with a younger version of Francesca (played by Olivia Bond) who lives on a secluded farmhouse with her surgeon mother and her father. Even as a young seemingly innocent child you can tell that she is no normal child. Something dark and unsettling lingers in her eyes. At this young age Francesca is forced to witness a deeply traumatic event which seems to awaken that darkness from deep inside her.Fast forward a few years later as a young woman we follow her as she tries to cope with loneliness while falling deeper into the darkness (played by Kika Magalhaes ). She is a dark, brutal character who's actions make you terrified of her but in a weird way watching her try to socialize and live a normal life brings out some sort of an innocence in her that makes you feel sympathy for her and Kika Magalhaes manages to bring out both of those sides of her beautifully.The bottom line is that it's a movie that you will either love very much or a movie that you will hate. It is a very hard film to digest after all. For me, I was hooked from the first scene. The eerie, hypnotic cinematography combined with the beautiful soundtrack make it a very enjoyable viewing.That being said, hopefully I managed peak your interest without revealing too much of the movie and I look forward to hearing your thoughts on the movie. If you are a fan of unique and different movies you will definitely enjoy this. This was Nicolas Pesce's directorial debut and for his first film he did an excellent job and I will definitely be looking forward to his future projects."
" A true work of art; stunning and disturbing
",2018-05-01 00:00:00,10,"This is what a horror movie should be. I was disturbed. Unsettled. After the movie, the story and characters stayed with me for awhile. There was true heart and soul put into this into this entire film; the story, the characters, the cinematography, the direction. Every aspect of this movie was well planned and executed.I highly recommend The Eyes of My Mother. It is definitely worth your time."
" a movie made by someone who does not understand art
",2018-03-17 00:00:00,4,"Young director, Nicholas Pesce wanted us to watch a movie with the eyes of the psychopath he has created. So we see a dark horror film with so much emptiness everywhere across the film. But personally, what I never forgive, is when characters act absurdly. I am talking about the father, mother as well as their daughter. Her mother performs surgery of a head of a cow and teaches her little daughter about eyes. I am now sure how appropriate for a medical practitioner to behave in such a way in front of a child.
After a psychopath kills the mother, we see the father becomes depressed and the child cleaning blood - taking care of the imprisoned psychopath in an unkind, psychopathic way. So that means this girl was born without empathy, kindness and all those basic human attributes.
From this point, I am convinced both the father, the mother never behaved like normal human beings.
And I don't want to think about what goes on in this film, how this little girl maintains a daily life.
In the end, even we saw police cars straight heading to the insane psychopath's house. I was thinking, a woman, lived years in such prison, who we found in a scene she has become speech impaired, somehow able to tell the exact place under couple of hours of being rescued.
Another unusual yet terrible thing is when the insane psychopath, who I absolutely have no sympathy for, when was performing rough surgery, the victims didn't even scream. I really cannot imagine what was in the director's mind before making such a story or scene.
We see full shots, sometimes narrow shots through windows, or typically entrance of doorways. I appreciate the cinematography and the way it is directed but there is nothing new about it that we haven't seen before and nothing good about it that we haven't felt before."
" This movie is a piece of vomit
",2018-02-13 00:00:00,1,Movies like this is the reason why some people despise art in general.
" Impressive and Deeply Disturbing Debut
",2018-01-22 00:00:00,8,"The Eyes of My Mother is a chilling psychological horror film. I found this film scrolling through Netflix and knew nothing about it, other than the brief and vague summary. After viewing all 76 minutes of it, I can honestly say I was fairly floored.
The film begins with the young main character, Francisca, tending to the cows on her rural and isolated farm home with her mother, am older portuguese woman who used to work as an eye surgeon. She explains the legend of Saint Francis of Assisi to Francisca and they go inside to clean the head of one of the cows. Later on, a strange door to door salesman comes to their home and asks to come in and use their bathroom. You know where this is going. The aging father returns home to find Francisca unharmed and the man mutilating the body of the mother in the bathroom. Chillingly undisturbed, the father knocks the man unconscious and chains him up in the barn, before making Francisca clean the bathroom and help him bury the mother's body, which she does quietly and compliantly. The next day Francisca goes to the barn to tend to the man's wounds, and inquiries about his desire for killing. When he asks if she plans to kill him, she sincerely responds, ""why would I kill you? You're my only friend. I'm going to take care of you."" Where the film goes from here, I will leave unexplained. It's worth experiencing for yourself with no knowledge. 
There are influences apparent here: I see similarities to both Lars Von Trier's 2009 film Antichrist, as well as Cormac McCarthy's 1973 novel Child of God. I don't know if I would call it better than either of these works, but it is fascinating in it's own right. With subject matter like this, it would be far too easy for this film to devolve into a simple fucked-up torture porn gore fest, but to the contrary, the violence, while there and disturbing, is handled surprisingly elegantly and with restraint. Many of the most gruesome moments are not shown onscreen, and when violence is shown, it is brief and not very bloody. This isn't to say the film is watering down anything, quite the contrary: the film is very deeply disturbing and many of these images will sear into your subconscious and refuse to go away. This is because the director understands what makes effective horror- it is what you don't see, it is the subtle creeping things, it is the things that you notice in the frame that aren't forced into your face. Presentation is everything, and this film's presentation makes it chillingly effective. The use of long takes, wide angles, slow creeping movement in the frame, and especially how the subjects are left small in their environments in many shots, makes these images of depravity all the more disturbing.
Despite this, the film is thankfully more than simply an exercise in how uneasy the audience can feel- there is a good bit to chew on thematically as well. This is ultimately a story about isolation and the damage it can have on a person in the long term. The mother's retelling of the story of Francis of Assisi at the beginning sets up much of the symbolism for the film- Francis spent much time in his life in isolation, and ended up being fatally afflicted with Trachoma (and infectious disease of the eye). Eyes are an important motif in the film that are returned to frequently, as well as what they represent- bearing witness, ""seeing"" into another person and the inner workings of their thoughts. It is the depravity Francisca witnesses as a child that scars her, and there are more instances of these things throughout the film that hopefully one will notice while viewing. This, paired with her lifelong isolation and loneliness, are the determining factors for her descent into depravity. Her being named for Saint Francis of Assisi is apparent and it creates a very interesting juxtaposition. Ultimately, despite the fact the she becomes a terrifying presence, we still fell deep sympathy for her, and to an extent, we understand her eventual fall, with no small thanks to the hauntingly real performance of the main actress.
There are points in the film where you feel the story could be going into ridiculous territory, but it does not move in a predictable fashion. As I was watching this, I was dreading the point where a part of the film dragged, or there was some misstep in the story, but every shot in this film, every line, feels like the director and writer was completely confident in it succeeding, and it does. 
The directing and camerawork are also very pleasing for anyone that analyzes these things in a film. Right from the beginning, this cinematography is fascinating- the warm black and white gives the film an almost otherworldly feel, and the shots, whether it be two characters on a couch inside or a shot of the bucolic countryside, are all framed and composed like each one is a beautiful photograph and it is very visually pleasing. The film seems to be set during the 1950s or 60s, but it is very timeless and almost feels like it is set in a different world entirely. The fact that this is a director debut makes it all the more impressive.
This isn't to say the film is entirely flawless- there is a piece of ADR near the beginning that I can only describe as awfully synced, and there are some scenes around the second act (the three acts are conveniently divided as I II and III) that feel slower and unnecessary to the film. Thankfully these are still somewhat interesting and don't detract from the film, although the film wouldn't be any worse without them. This definitely not a film for everyone: It is violent, it is disturbing, it is terribly sad, and it will certainly haunt you for long after it's over. I can't entirely fault someone for hating this film. But I was riveted from start to finish."
" This movie is no better than an average 10 minute prologue stretched out to 70 minutes.
",2017-11-30 00:00:00,1,"A very bad movie that has no story whatsoever. And despite what the genre claims to be, this is not a horror.You expect something to happen during the movie to make it worthwhile watching, but this movie just teases you with very boring scenes until the very end.Imagine a movie that has a continuous prologue which lasts 70 minutes and then just ends without anything interesting happening.No actions, no story and funnily enough not even a sight of dialogue. Mr. Beans comedy movies have more dialogue.Not worth watching."

It's one of those movies that you can watch more than once, and still enjoy it. (:"
" Haunting
",2017-11-02 00:00:00,8,"The Eyes of My Mother is director Nicolas Pesce's directorial debut, and an impressive one at that. It's an extremely intentional black & white art-house horror film, with more attention to detail than gore throughout.The story centers around Francisca (played by Olivia Bond first and then Kika Magalhães who was particularly awesome), a young girl whose quiet, simple life is turned upside-down by the murder of her mother (Diana Agostini) and, shortly after, the passing of her father (Paul Nazak).** SPOILERS! **I thought the choice of black and white was excellent. There were many scenes that played out like beautiful, striking photographs set in motion. It also dulled the gore (that was more plentiful now that I think about it in retrospect than I honestly noticed in the moment) while letting us focus on more of the emotion (or lack thereof) in the more brutal scenes. But some shots, like Francisca climbing into the tub while bathing her father's body, are made into pure heartbreaking art by the color choice.Charlie (Will Brill), the man who kills Francisca's mother with an unabashed enthusiasm that was disturbing to see, was a great character that I almost wish we saw more of. He just immediately made me feel uncomfortable even before having any inkling of his true intentions.Each scene — every single one — felt very intentionally placed and timed. Nothing was left out, and nothing was there just as a frill it was meticulously planned.Francisca both as a child and as an older teenager (we're never really sure of her true age but she seems to be 20 at the oldest) has this detached fascination about her. You get the sense that she's barely ever had to focus on anyone but herself. Her mother's mention of ""loneliness can do strange things to the mind"" couldn't be more apt. She works in silence, methodically playing out some truly twisted acts with the casual mood one might have while slicing a cucumber (I didn't mean for that comparison to be so accurate but there it is), and yet there's such a desperation about her, such a yearning to be less alone, and an unwillingness, or inability, to see how her desires affect others. Her stealing the woman's baby was another example: watching her cuddle and coo at the baby, finally having someone who will be forced to be her companion, as the child's mother crawled, gasping, towards her was chilling.One of the few times she breaks this blankness is when she finally kills Charlie after he escapes from the barn. Her stabbing him is almost sensual, especially as she rubs his hair and kisses his neck, and it made it one of the most disturbing murder scenes I've seen in a LONG timeUltimately, less is more, and Pesce really knew how to use that to his advantage with a brilliant combination of artful shots, a heartbreaking desire to ease pain and loneliness, and unapologetic views of violence and sadism, a sort of Americana-gone- very-wrong."

Would not waste my time watching this rubbish.

" Mastery of unease
",2017-10-04 00:00:00,10,"There are those rare moments in cinematic experiences when, as a horror fanatic, that in the midst of the banal tropes and fluff of this genre, there is that rare shining pearl that lends a glimmer of hope that there lies the last vestiges of high quality dramatic independent horror. And this movie brilliantly captures that. I can't imagine anyone that would give this movie a poor rating. It is deserving of any award for its quiet mastery of the art of nail biting tension, angst, anxiety, despair, utter hopelessness, depravity and every mother's worst fear. If you're able to stomach this and embrace the sheer agony and complexity of the raw emotions of the protagonist's demented tortured soul and how one can't help to feel pity yet repulsion and disgust simultaneously. It's an emotional roller-coaster few films can capture the essence and dynamics of so masterfully and boldly."

Her mother (Diana Agostini) was an eye surgeon from Portugal and practices her craft on cows with her daughter apprentice. Mom explains there is an eye disease which cause psychosis. Francesca becomes psychotic, but shows no other symptoms that would pinpoint a specific disease.The production is in black and white and divided into three sections like a play (Mother, Father, Family). This makes it look like Gothic art and critics will swoon all over it, in spite of the films short comings. The plot had holes in it. Certainly Francesca had more contact with the outside world than what we saw. Who paid the light bill? How did she learn to drive? Can a person really survive 11 years chained to a concrete floor in their underwear? Wouldn't they freeze in winter? No, the focus was on Francesca, who we really didn't know as a person, other than she was mentally ill. We pitied her. It was a sad film, but not a tear jerker.Guide: No swearing. Implied sex.

" I . . . I don't know
",2017-08-23 00:00:00,7,"I made an account on IMDb for the sole purpose of reviewing this film because I have a lot of feelings. My favorite genre when it comes to movies is horror, and unless something is terribly jumpy I normally don't scare easily. This movie, however is an entirely different story. My friend chose this movie completely at random on Netflix one night, and within, I think 11 minutes, I told him ""what the f*** turn this off I absolutely cannot watch anymore of this."" Fast-forward two months later and he talks me into finishing it, and this movie is truly disturbing in a way that you can't quite describe. I felt sick watching this. That being said, I can recognize it for what it is, and that is an incredibly well executed horror film. Would I recommend anyone watch it? Hell no. Well, maybe."
" Eyes of desolation
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,10,"Sometimes, the road to the most absolute desolation, passes through murder, torture and confinement. In The Eyes of My Mother (2016), Nicolas Pesce's first film, violence does not impress by the use of blood but by its coldness, in the camera, in the actors, in the landscape: an icy nature that, however, in itself does not exclude the recognition in the other. The horror and the disturbance, in black and white (the most suitable media to express the light and the darkness of time) crosses the eyes of the spectators and the characters; and this horror tinged with the sadness of fado, the Portuguese songs that seem even more desolate in the immensities of the North American prairies (almost as in those typical Russian songs, where there is always a husband, a son or a mother, lost in the war, or winter, and that never returns), in the end, recreates an appearance of pain, the illusion of a self-contained picture that closes on itself and from which the viewer can not easily escape. Not every spectator, it is true; for as in some mysticisms, not all human beings will gain access to the soul, nor to the necessary state of mind, which requires the contemplation.Francisca, the orphan, like her parents, seems to have chosen isolation, not because she prefers it, but because it is the only thing she knows. What she has learned from her mother, in this kind of universe of American Gothic, German expressionism and Portuguese melodrama, are not only the skills of a butcher or a surgeon on the battlefield; but also the compassion of all who must work with the flesh. For Francisca's eyes there is no evil; there are only accidents and chances, and there is also no joy in revenge, not even in crime. Just as you have to sew an open wound, they are only things that sometimes, sometimes a lifetime, must be done. And in this fatalism (fado or destiny in Portuguese), which is within the same beings and not outside, it is not the insensitivity towards hurt and pain, neither its frozen glance, but its intense desire not to be alone, which in the end will condemn Francisca to an implacable solitude, and to a new exile: not from the land on the other side of the ocean, like that of her mother, but of all humanity."
" Takes Time to Build
",2017-07-06 00:00:00,8,"As far as ""conventional"" horror goes, this couldn't be more different. It's worlds apart in regards to what we tend to label as horror — no jump scares, no boogeyman to run from, and a distinct lack of gratuitous gore has allowed this film to standout as a genuine psychological terror. It's slow in the progression of plot, but the time it takes works as a boon in the long run. In creating a space of total isolation and loneliness, we're allowed to witness the full transformation of a traumatized (and, admittedly, thoroughly maladjusted) child into a young woman that doesn't have a grasp on the reality that exists outside her bubble of delusion. The meticulous nature of this slow burn story is an honest reminder that this is horror at its most human: this could easily be a reality for any of us."
" Wow, impressive, disturbing, fantastic!
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,10,"Strange, bizarre, unsettling. The subplots are all the more disturbing and explain the premise well. The cinematography is just fantastic! The use of black & white film stock, the lighting in the scenes, the intense focal distances, the lingering distance shots. This is how black and with films, done well, are just so very impressive. It is obvious the detail in each scene was no accident much like and great work, the stage is set for a reason. Make sure you take in the subtle placement of seemingly random objects.The unseen can be more upsetting than the typical goriness you usually come across in most of today's horror flicks. Camera angles, blocking of the actors and symmetry of each bit of the movie is many times lacking in what we are watching in today's horror films, you know what's happening, it is bothersome without buckets of blood. It works. When is comes to effective foley work, the audio we hear just off screen from television, record player or radio, it all is wonderfully orchestrated adding suspense or foreshadowing, remarkable but not in your face. I really also enjoyed the soundtrack, ire at times. All adding to the whole feel of the flick.The writing and dialogue is also amazing. Use of foreign language interaction to make a point makes you get an old world kind of feel, adding to the idea that something is happening. We may not understand culturally, but we are not really sure that is the problem. Why are these characters acting oddly? Our perceptions of what is really evil is put on it's head throughout the film. Fantastic! Who is really crazy, really sick, really perverse? Who should we really fear? As it is in real life, evil at first glance is hard to spot, but something in our cut tells us to be careful.Sometimes writers don't make great directors, but Nicolas Pesce hits this one out of the ballpark on both counts!"
" One of the most unsettling final acts of a movie I've seen in a long time
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,7,"This movie is mediocre in the first 45 to 50 minutes. However, something happens after this that really left me with a feeling I can't describe. The Eyes of My Mother is a directorial debut set in black & white and after seeing it I'm excited to see what else the director does. The cinematography is also effective. Especially in some scenes with a shed and some chains.The acting was good from everyone involved seeing as though I hadn't seen anything else these people have done. The lead actress does a good job of showing the true loneliness of her character.The concept of what goes down in the final act is truly haunting and it's pulled off really well. I don't know if I'd like the movie as much if it wasn't in black & white and I'm interested to see if the director is going to make all of his future movies black & white. If so I'm not complaining because it's something that isn't done that much these days."
" A quiet, disturbing horror film.
",2017-06-10 00:00:00,10,"I went into this knowing a little about it and came out pleasantly surprised. A fantastic psychological horror film and a great character study. I loved the black-and-white filter. It added to the already unsettling feel. The music and camera work also added to the suspense. Clocking in at just 76 minutes, it may seem short but the run time is actually one of it's many strengths. It never feels bloated and never overstays it's welcome. It's a slow moving film, but I never felt disinterested. In fact, I was sucked in from beginning to end. This is indie horror at it's best. I loved it so much, that right after it ended, I ordered the Blu-Ray off of Amazon. Who said that the horror genre was dead?"
" MEMORABLE, in capital letters.
",2017-05-30 00:00:00,10,"""The Eyes of My Mother"" gets under your skin - it's disturbing, poetic, beautiful, twisted, and for this viewer, unforgettable. Most horror movies these days (or any kind) don't have much happening on the subconscious level, a lot of them tend to be more self-conscious, skating along on the surface, with twists and turns in the plot, jump scares, etc., but occasionally a film comes along that taps right into the unconscious, ala ""Night of the Hunter"", ""Psycho"" - I would consider ""Eyes"" to fit in that grand company. The fact that this film was written and directed by a 26 year-old, Nicholas Pesce, (his directorial debut) is amazing - his control and mastery would seem to require multiple efforts - but talent is a mysterious thing. I could go on and on, the cinematography is sublime, the sound design, the acting, everything is pitch-perfect. I'll be anxiously awaiting Pesce's next film, the boy has a vision."
" Awful
",2017-05-23 00:00:00,1,"There is no redeeming quality in this movie, the plot is ridiculous, no likable characters, didn't give me any reason to sit through and give up 76 mins of my time, tries too hard to shock or be artsy. Appeals to empty-headed pretentious type people, they eat up this kind of trash. The fact that this movie is rated as high as it is, makes me want to puke.I'm a big horror fan. I'm very one dimensional when it comes to movies, if it's not Horror, I'm Not Interested. I like to watch horror movies from the 70's to 2017, so me hating this movie has nothing to do with the genre. To each his own, and I personally can't stand this film. Christ if I had the power to switch the rating of 1980's Demented (rated 3.8) with this movie (rated 6.2), I would."

Some are understated and do not try to sell a certain point too much and so forth. This is a real slow burner and just for that will not please many horror fans who like their Horror to be explicit.Don't get me wrong, this does get dirty and mean, but it's also very weird and way disturbing. Like really out there disturbing. You could compare this to things like Maniac, but with a family twist. It's really not entertainment as such, but it does succeed in having a despicable person in the lead and still be engaging for some weird reason. I can't really put my finger on it, it may be the black and white nature of the way it is shot, making it look classy, sort of. Whatever it is the filmmaker succeeded in telling a suspenseful story. If it's to your liking or not will depend on your taste - no pun intended"
" Slow black and white wannabe horror movie
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,4,"For a horror movie I see that The Eyes Of My Mother gets a high rating on here. But it doesn't deserve that rating in my opinion. It's a mediocre horror movie with a very slow story. It's just hard to stay awake, even with the couple bloody scenes. Well not red blood but black and white since this movie is shot in black and white. I don't know why they do such a thing because to me it certainly doesn't bring anything to the movie. Maybe they thought it would be darker or so but to me it didn't work. The idea of the story isn't bad though. It's just the execution that fails. If it would be shot in color and if it wouldn't be that slow, with also a bit more gory details it could have been a better movie. But like it is now it's just not interesting enough to be remembered."
" Incomplete lessons and unexpected events of a girl's life!
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,6,"The film story has a deeper thought than just what you see it as a psychological drama. Everything is simply like what the title says. A young woman grew up in an isolated farmhouse with her father without many visitors. But her interest in the eyes came from her mother who was a surgeon killed by an intruder. So her character was built on those circumstances and where her future head is to come in the later parts.The concept looked much better, but the film was too slow, even though it was a little shorter than the average film runtime. It is also a black and white film, and looked fine for such theme. Even though there were not strong gore. Limited cast and shot most of the parts is a single location and its surroundings. So it is a small budget film with good casting. But I'm having a mixed feeling for it. I think some would like it, and some wouldn't, but the majority would be like me stand in the middle. So I conclude saying it is an okay-okay film.6/10"

" A Prententious and Painfully Slow Horror Film
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,3,"The Eyes of My Mother tells the story of a young girl as she is subjected to a horrific and violent event that leads to her mother being killed at her family's remote farmhouse. As the father comes home, he knocks out her killer and decides to hold him hostage in a barn. Sounds good, right? Wrong! The Eyes of My Mother is one of the most pretentious and idiotic attempts at creating an atmospheric film that I've ever seen. Filmed in the stark beauty of black and white, the film never exceeds more than 60 shots and each shot lingers for far too long in hopes of creating tension. It doesn't. Instead, the film tries to make the most out of its paper thin plot by stretching out everything. The dialog is stretched, the shots are stretched, everything feels stretched so thin that it is hard to even determine whether the film had enough in its tank to fill the short runtime. At 76 minutes, this film should have been snappy and very intriguing. It ends up feeling like 176 minutes. It's painfully slow and boring and it is clear that director Nicolas Pesce was determined to make a feature length film on a subject that a short film could have handsomely supported. Overall, The Eyes of My Mother is one of the slowest and emptiest films I've ever seen. Despite its look and decent acting, the film suffers from a poor script and terrible pacing."

After saying all of that I am giving this film a 10 for a number of reasons. It's unique, disturbing and more horrific than all the slasher, gore-fests out there.I've been a lover of horror films most of my life but have soured over the past 10 - 15 years due to the lack of imagination and cookie cutter plots that have inundated the genre. You can predict almost everything that will happen, plus the acting is usually wooden, etc.Not so with this brilliant film. Filmed in stark black and white, it captures you from the opening scene and doesn't let go. If you watch it on DVD, I would also recommend you watch the director's comments. This is a 27 year old who wrote, directed and edited the film. I predict great films from him.If you like a different kind of horror story, please watch this film!"
" ""Asks a little too much from it's audience""
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,6,"This review of The Eyes Of My Mother is spoiler free*** (3/5)IF ANA LILY Amirpour's exquisite debut feature A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night taught us anything, it's that horrors scratched down to their bare materials including colour is just as effective as or perhaps more effective than those with all the materials. Given that a foreboding soundtrack adds to that a little bit more, this leading to obvious nods to other black-and-white horror classics such as Nosfaratu, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and the eerily creepy The Night Of The Living Dead, there's a certain original tone to this whole black-and-white material.Another filmmaker inspired by this technique is writer-director Nicolas Pesce who adds a lot of tension to his debut The Eyes Of My Mother. An original feature that places its main character Francisca (Kika Magalhaes), a woman living a lonely country life in the middle of nowhere, he gives her a story she feels pain in fact this pain is shown from the first few moments of the film. Opening with her as a young girl (Olivia Bond) learning about what her mother (Diana Agostini) does for a living, in her origin country she teaches her daughter about the eyes of animals, namely cows, and how they are not so different to a human's eyes. They are encountered by an adventurous man (Will Brill) who is friendly at first but when the tides changes and when the film proves its title. Years later her father is struck by death preaching that she doesn't want to be alone, she decides to make this her profession, and she lures people into her home and takes their eyes. It may sound like a psycho-killer slasher but really it's not because Pesce's character study shows that she just wants company she hates being alone. Of course it's not perfect there are flaws; although the character study is unique to a point she doesn't have any emotion this elevating her to a natural slasher villain presenting herself as a female Jekyll and Hyde, also for most of the film's run-time it's shrouded in silence as our character doesn't say very much. At points this film is flawed but it's a stunningly dark brandished nightmare, that's chilling and literally pulls punches to the scalpel before it. It's essentially folk legend stuff that's quirkily directed and delivers a lot of tension. VERDICT: A chilling, unsettling horror which has its elements narrowed down to its bare minimum from the very first shot. It's essentially folk legend stuff that slightly asks too much of its audience."
" Movie too dragging and ending too sudden
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,6,"The black and white and the Portuguese fado really set a great atmosphere in this movie. It sets the stage for a horrifying and disturbing story. But until near the end of the movie nothing actually happens, except for some background story. The few dialogues are monosyllabic, scenes are cut just when they start to get interesting, and the entire movie is interspersed with long dragging static scenes and exaggerated time leaps. Character development here is practically zero.When the real substance of the plot begins, the movie is 20 minutes from the end.The choices made here are confusing. The entire movie is about 75 minutes long, and although they abuse static scenes (making it feel a lot longer, by the way), they couldn't spare 3 or 5 more minutes to make a decent ending. The ending is clear to the viewer, but as with all interesting scenes, it is cut short just before the climax."

To think that a child could evolve into something that morbid is absolutely terrifying and even though this is fiction it definitely had me wondering about all sorts of things.The fact that the film is entirely shown in black and white added to the isolated and grisly atmosphere. The sounds, especially the wind, had much the same effect. And the way the scenes were filmed, following Francisca around, emphasised her gracefulness in all movements, regardless of whether affection or horror inducing.Being Portuguese, it bothered me that the mother and child characters did not speak the language well, especially when the grown Francisca was obviously native. However, they were both amazing and I only wish I could have seen more interaction between them.From then on, most of what happens is very disturbing but also very subtle, requiring you to use your imagination to fill in the gaps. I had not even grasped that Francisca's mother had died until a couple of scenes later. However, there is also plenty of gore, even if muted thanks to the B&W, and the result of this delicate balance is a gruesome film that I am so glad I managed to watch, as it is truly special. There is such a psychological depth to this movie, and a perfect balance between macabre and normalcy that I never knew was possible in a horror film.Even if not perfect plotwise, The Eyes of My Mother will surely stay with me for a long time. It is one of the few I can safely say I would like to watch again.Now let's just hope I won't have any nightmares tonight."
" Not a horror - but fantastic film
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,7,For people who are expecting a slasher or bloody and gore film then this isn't one for you...Probably one of the best films of this year and the cinematography in black and white is brilliant and just adds to the suspense of the film throughout.Personally I loved that this film made me feel uncomfortable the entire time never knowing what was going to happen.It makes you feel sympathetic to the main character but also for the rest of the cast as well in a messed up way! I am not going to let anything away with this film but for commercial horror fans this isn't for you.Think the anti Christ without sex but with a stunning female lead who work solo through out and make us fall in love yet hate and also feel Sorry for her all at the same time! A must see
" Seriously stupid
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,1,"I do not understand what all the hype is about. This is not a horror story. There is nothing about this movie to classify It as horror. It is a black and white drama. The story line is weird and at times does not flow smoothly. Nor does it make sense. I really think the woman has severe mental issues. She is portrayed as very bizarre or at least has bizarre behavior. The movie is long and drawn out with so many irrelevant scenes. One scene you just watch The drivers' perspective driving down the road to her destination. Really? How pointless and boring! The acting was standard, not great but not bad. I really don't get the rave reviews from the critics. You need to read the reviews from people who have nothing to gain by reviewing movies. We give the honest, impartial reviews. The reviews you can really trust."
" bizarre horror story in art-house style
",2017-01-30 00:00:00,6,"This is a difficult one, i mean, it's a horror story but everything is done off-camera so no red stuff or to be honest nothing at all and still some do find it rather creepy.Being shot in black and white doesn't make it easier to watch. It do has an overall art-house overlook so many geeks in the horror genre will stop this flick quickly. But it's worth picking up, at this writing it's all over the world being shown at festivals. Why should you watch it, well, if you're into art-house you will love this or if you do like creepy stories then this is also a must see. You are left with your imagination and you will be pushed in your mind that this could happen with the girl next door. It's all seeing normal but it isn't because torture and in fact child abuse are the main theme. With eyes being poked out and having sex with your victims is very rare to watch. What turns out to be a home invasion turns a complete different way. Be open minded and see this rather bizarre story.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 0/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5"
" Interesting but a bit too thin to be masterful!
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,6,"The Eyes of My Mother is definitely a movie that separates itself from the norm. Telling the story of a Young girl who is thrust into a life of hardship and loneliness, The Eyes of My Mother portrays itself in a very unsettling black and White tone. Whether you call it pretentious or not, the cinematography does a great job at getting you into the psyche that the movie wants! Depicting themes of loneliness and love, the movie manages to create a central villain that is more dimensional than most! Combining this with some horrific acts of violence and a moody score, The Eyes of my Mother is a movie that wont be forgotten quickly. The fact that it goes for only just over 70 minutes is its downfall however, as i didn't think it was sufficient time to really make use of the interesting material that it had! That being said, this is still a movie that i would recommend, even if it isn't the masterful experience that i was expecting!"
" Messed up and yet sympathetic film
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,6,"This is a gruesome and yet abstract movie that will be difficult for some audiences to sit through. Not because it's overly full of gruesome scenes, but because of the psychologically disturbing parts. As a matter of fact, this film surprisingly changes scene before a violent and gory parts are about to take place. The black and white cinematography actually adds to the visual effects and make the film appear more ethereal and psychotic. This film delves into the mental instability of a girl that witnesses traumatic and messed up stuff. And has to deal with seclusion and loneliness that overcomes her. From the beginning the film appeared very psychedelic and brought about a very creepy vibe. What stands out about this film is some of the unexpected turn of events. And how it builds sympathy for the protagonist because of her longing to be loved. Overall, this isn't a film I would see again, despite the very short run time it did feel a bit tedious after a while. However if you are in the mood for a short disturbing, psychotic and ambient horror movie. 6.5/10"
" Sad, depressive, beautiful, ugly, disturbing, sick, tragic...
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,7,"Synopsis (and spoilers) of the first 20 minutes:60's or 70's of the 20th century somewhere in the USA. An isolated farm in the middle of nowhere. A family apparently normal. The mother, former surgeon in Portugal, teaches her 10 years old or so daughter Francisca how to tend the cattle and how to prepare it as food, denoting that from early age she is not sensitized by the sight of entrails. They also speak both in English and Portuguese.One day a strange appears, revealing himself to be a psychopath that kills the mother just before the father arrives. Somehow off-screen (and there are many moments off-screen but with explicit message) the killer ends up beaten and chained in the barn.The years pass and the child becomes a woman without any social nor moral values due to her extreme isolation, incapable of distinguishing good from evil (and the father does not help either due to his apathetic personality or perhaps he became so after the trauma of losing his wife).When the father dies, the loneliness of Francisca becomes overwhelming, being that every attempt at human contact ends up tragically for those unfortunate ones who cross paths with her.My verdict:The movie is in black and white (which plays on its favor), does not contain too many gore, is extremely slow paced even for just 76 minutes of its duration, but the images and message are strong and disturbing enough to be clearly classified as horror. Horror more psychological than visual, but yet highly effective. The only negative aspect I have to point is the fact that the daughter speaks Portuguese better than the mother, which is odd, but since the mother as little screen time it does not affect the overall quality.If you're looking for gore this is not the movie; but if you seek a truly terrifying story, then I highly recommend it."
" Excruciating
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,5,"This is not a brilliant movie. In my opinion, it's not even a good movie. But it achieves what it supposedly set out to do, and that was to portray life from the point of view of a lonely psychopath. And that portrayal is absolutely excruciating.Having grown up on an isolated farm, loneliness is always Fransisca's first and foremost problem, and we the audience are made to feel that in agonizing detail. The movie feels slow, the few other characters have short screen time and are usually mute, and the movie is in drab black and white.Being a psychopath, Fransisca feels absolutely nothing for anybody else, and has no qualms about what she does to others to fulfill her own desires. Once again, we the audience, are made to suffer 72 minutes of this abominable character, and wonder if she is so loathed does she have any sense of self-loathing too?Does Fransisca represent a psychopath? Probably. Is the role played well by the lead actress? Yes. Is the movie worth watching? I would say NO, not unless you have to reference it for a term paper in Psychology 101 or something.P.S. what is up with the title of this film? It has no bearing on the movie, believe me. Just because she misses Mom the most, and her Mom was an eye surgeon, doesn't mean you have to force 'Mother' and 'Eyes' in the title."
" Don't accept the invite!
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,5,"Just another lovely day at your isolated farmhouse in the middle of  nowhere. You milk the cattle, muck out the pigs, feed the captive in  the barn you've held prisoner for years who's eyes you gauged out...  WHAT?!  Yes, you read that right. The protagonist here is a certifiable  headcase who just wants your company, but instead of a nice chat over a  cup of tea, she requires you to stay FOREVER. When she was young you  see, her mother taught how to dissect animals, then she saw the same  woman chopped up in front of her by an aimless drifter. No surprisingly  she's ever so slightly messed up...  Shot in eerie black and white, 'The Eyes Of My Mother' is an  atmospheric horror film with a great premise, but something is missing  to make it a priority watch. It might be too short to leave much of an  impression, the acting generally isn't the best and with so little  happening, things tend to drag a little. The ending too, feel like a  major anticlimax. True, it's hard to imagine the film finishing any  other way, but... yeah.  Could be better. 5/10"
" A horror masterpiece
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,10,"It defies belief that some film makers can make dozens of films throughout their career, garnering experience the entire time, and never make a film half as good as 'The Eyes of My Mother', and then someone can come along on their very first attempt and achieve this masterpiece. Nicolas Pesce on writing/directing debut shows true class and masterful control of his story. Every scene is beautifully laid out and haunting in its own way. This is the work of a master, not a novice.One of the things I liked most about this movie was that it never insults its viewer. A lot of the story was left up to interpretation. We are given small hints towards things in the dialogue here and there, but must make our own decisions on what the truth actually is.The first two-thirds of the film were so strong that I was almost expecting to be let down by the final third. It seems today that films struggle to be consistently good throughout and usually end up mucking up at least one portion of their story. Instead 'The Eyes of My Mother' makes the final third its strongest of the lot. Modern horror tends to rely incredibly heavily on jump scares. In fact it's all a lot of them have going for them. There is not a single jump scare in this film and yet it is infinitely more scary and memorable than 99% of horror films released today. This is a movie that will stick with me for a while and one that I will probably watch again. Do not miss this film."
" Really bad!
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,1,"OK so this is my first review of a movie on IMDb. Usually i don't write reviews, but this movie is such an embaracing to the ""supposed"" horror genre. That i had to write a few lines. In the first place i don't understand the raving reviews about the movie. Really?? Do you even know what is a storyline, or good acting, or movie Direction? Just because the movie is shot in black and has slow tempo it doesn't make it a work of art, nevertheless a good (horror) movie. In the second place what was that? A movie really? Do you call that a movie? This was just a total mess, dumb, stupid, dull, full of bad clichés and wanabe pseudo artistic camera angles. This movie has no story at all, just a bunch of stupid actions that someone decided to write and film. Everything seems forced and its hardly convincing, the actors, the characters, the ""story"", even the music performed by Amália Rodrigues they achieved to murder. And to call this an horror genre...Please! More like a bad comedy."
" Simply awful.
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,1,"Awful. Simply awful; not good as in horror, but.... I don't even know is there a term that would perfectly describe this movie. You can retell movie in less than half of a minute. One day mother talks with her daughter about anatomy. Stranger comes into house, kills mother, daughter treats wounds that her dad gave to him. Father dies, girl's lonely and she gets lesbian friend that she kills. One day she meets mother of a child and kidnaps the baby, mother is being tortured and put in the barn. Kid founds out, lets his mother, police founds out and she dead. No story development, usage of retardation is over the top-FILM NOIR? More like film disappoint me. The End. ABSOLUTE disappointment. Would not recommend"
" Here's Looking at You, Kid
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,8,"Much like the lack of color, it's the lack of what you'll see that lets your imagination make this one of the most gruesome projects in cinema history.A movie critic friend of my raved about this on his weekly podcast (the best podcast out there, that is: Fat Guys at the Movies. Not being biased, it really is the best for movie news, reviews, opinions, etc. I digress) and it reminded me a lot of a favorite film of mine: Frailty. He described the movie as the anti-shock, shockingly disgusting but not for shock's sake, to sum up anyways. Frailty is pretty much the same for me.Frailty deals with a ""serial killer"" who uses an axe on his ""victims"" in a horrific, albeit off-screen way. I dug that technique as horror fans, such as me, have seen truly grotesque films and sometimesit gets tiring. And in the way of story, acting, originality, etc. So, both Frailty and The Eyes of My Mother are both refreshing views in horror.But, that's where the similarities end. Where Frailty is a fairly straightforward thriller, so to speak, The Eyes of My Mother is a bizarre, yet incredibly original story of the journey of a psychopath.In what begins in The Village world, a fairly isolated couple and their young daughter immediately show signs these people are not right. After the brutal murder of the mother, the movie simultaneously stays in reality and down the rabbit hole as the kid growsworse and worse. I feel like I've gone too far into ""spoiler"" territory, but believe me when I tell you: A) that's just the first 5 or less minutes and B) I gave away the very thinnest of synopsizes. It's up to you, pending how strong your stomach is and your mind open, to carry on watching one of the most unique horror movies, let alone any genre, humankind has seen.Oh, and it's also a silent killer. For only being 76 minutes, it a very deliberately paced thriller. As brutal as it is, it's not in-your-face as previous surreal, gorefests show, like similarly black & white: The Human Centipede II. Oh, sorry, I forgot to mention: It's black & white. I only hinted above. Got a good idea why they did that. Several, in fact, but it's still a very nicely shot film despite the lack of color that might have shown more beautiful backdrops.There were a few scenes I found hard to believe, but for the most part, it's scary how true this could be. It can be predictable at times and then WHOA in other scenes. And as upsetting as it was in moments, I truly admired this weird little film and it's no-holds-barred, exclusive vision. A definite recommendation to both horror fans and true movie lovers.***Final thoughts: Funny, this girl – the main star of The Eyes of My Mother, reminded me so much of Angela in Sleepaway Camp. Though the films couldn't be further apart in horror subgenres and I was only initially reminded of Angela for their close looks, I might be more onto something than just the physical attributes."
