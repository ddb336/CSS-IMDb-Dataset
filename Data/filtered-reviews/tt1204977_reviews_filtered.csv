" Lol at the people giving this 6 and 7
",2021-04-04 00:00:00,1,This movie is so bad it's actually ridiculous! Even if you're a fan of horror do not watch this crap. Terrible... the plot is so weak the movie both seems to drag on forever and be super quick because it has no substance.
" Oh so bad!
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,2,"Oh my days, this is appalling, it's like a student movie but worse. In fact I've seen better movies on YouTube made with amateur camera operators, directors and actors. This is a huge waste of everyone's time.
How on earth such a poor story found it's way on to Netflix is beyond me.I was home alone when I watched this, I love a decent horror story, this wasn't even mediocre, it was way worse. I'd have loved to have been scared. Sadly this misses the mark. I spent most of my time either tutting, laughing or shaking my head. Not once was I even mildly scared.
Amateur, cliched and boring Ouija is more of a tragedy, the biggest tragedy being the huge waste of time, money and resources this feeble attempt at third rate horror really is.
Sadly I'm old enough to remember when a decent horror story didn't rely on jump scare music but had enough suspense to actually make the audience feel fear."
" I love this film!!!!
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,6,"Look, I may have only rated it 6/10 but I absolutely love this film! It's well acted and highly entertaining! My slightly lowe score is because it follows a very familiar formular for horrors. It's very well made and well acted, I loved the story too - but for me the second film; the prequel was far superior! It's a shame because this film is gonna be one that's stuck in the non memorable category! I really really like it! I've probably watched it 10 times! It's not perfect, what horror film is- but it's certainly entertaining and if people just give it a chance it's Worthy of a bowl of popcorn!!"
" Horror movie for beginners
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,7,"Ouija is a horror movie for beginners. If you don't like horror movies or you've never seen any and you want to watch your first, this movie is for you. As another reviewer wrote its horror movie 101. A bunch of high school kids play a board game and bring an evil spirit to their lives. They start dying one after the other while the main character tries to stop it. It's not too scary, it's not too gory, it's not too good or too bad. A few jump scares, mediocre dialogue, ok acting and some decent special effects. There's nothing original about it. Perhaps a good movie for early teens who their parents never let them watch horror movies. To those of us who have seen our fair share of horror movies and look for something scary and/or original, this movie is not for you (unless it's the middle of the night and you're half asleep and bored then maybe you can watch it until you fall back asleep)."
" Shockingly forgettable movie.
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,4,This film is so generic and forgettable that I honestly got 70 minutes in to it before realising that I had already seen it before.The film makes it hard to care about the characters due to their mundane and dull personalities. Their decisions are bad even by horror movie standards as there seems little logicaly point for anything that they do.
" Interesting concept.
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,1,"Like the title says interesting concept. So many facts about spiritualism were wrong. And the cursor window is not a viewing window to see spirits. Like wtf did they get this stuff from. Practicing mediumism that's not a thing its spiritualism. I wanted to stop watching right after they tried to use the cursor as a viewer. But to create a whole new practice of ""mediumism"" come on do some research before you put a film together please."
" Not the greatest
",2021-01-07 00:00:00,4,"This movie was basically made fore 12 years old, the scare jumps, the acting, the script is perfect for people of young age that are just getting into horror movies."
" Omg so boring
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,1,"If you would like to waste some time of ur pointless life like mine, go ahead and watch it. But for real now this movie is a huge disappointment for first 50 mins nothing is happening and rest of the movie doesn't even make any sense."
" A fine horror movie
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,6,"I liked the whole idea, decent enough If you wanna see an ouija movie! Hoping there'll be a 2nd one tho"
" Just bad
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,1,Very very bad. I'm glad I didn't get blind watching this. My eyes and ears protesting me for a week now.
" I made an account just to write this
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,1,"I was bored, put on the first movie Netflix suggested and it was this as I just love horror movies. But boy do I regret that. This is one of the worst ""horror"" movies I've ever watched. It's as if the script writer googled ""horror movies"" and copy/pasted every plot clich√© from the lowest rating movies he could find. Every moment I spent watching it was a waste but I couldn't stop. Why? I thought to myself; ""it can't be that bad, right? There must be something original about it if It didn't get sued for plagiarism by now"". When I gave it a bit more thought, I concluded that the s**t movies they copied didn't probably even make enough money off it to sue anyone! For the love of the gods, I even predicted Debbie returning for those 5 seconds to save her friend at the end. So to sum it up, if you value your time, don't be like me and watch the movie. Go watch the news. They are more terrifying. Have a nice day. üòÅ"

" one of the best examples of those teen horror movies that monopoliezed and destroyed the horror scenario of the last decade
",2020-12-02 00:00:00,3,"""Ouija"" is one of the best examples of those teen horror movies that monopoliezed and destroyed the horror scenario of the last decade (fortunately now things seem to be changing).
Like all of these products, ""Ouija"" is nothing else that a compilation of unoriginal jump scares linked together by a story rushly written full of stupid, bland, cringy dialog and flat, empty, useless characters but what makes this one special is the absolute incapacity of the director to create any type of tension, suspense or at least atmosphere. Every scene is extremely flat, every shot is uninspired but most importantly every jump scares is poorly staged, more often randomly and forcibly inserted without ever credibility or a context where they could work.
It entertains only if you are searching for a movie to laugh at"
" So bad it's bad
",2020-11-19 00:00:00,2,The only good thing about this movie is that without it Mike Flanagan wouldn't have got to make the sequel.
" OK for a teen horror.
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,7,"Along with found footage horror, teen horrors tend to be my least favourite of the genre, but here's an exception.Good story, the teens aren't annoying, and it's well acted.Certainly worth a watch if supernatural horror is your thing, some good scares and it's suspenseful.Don't understand how people can rate this 4 and below"
" Sigh...
",2020-10-20 00:00:00,3,"A dull, lifeless, and forgettable mess- Ouija proves to be nothing more than an abundance of cliches and previously done callbacks to other and better horror flicks. This film is quite honestly worse than I expected it to be, and I had rather low expectations. I wanted to like it, I wanted to give it a chance, put those bad reviews to the side. But there is no doubt that this is a bad film, and there is really nothing redeemable about it. The one thing I liked about this film, is Lin Shaye. Granted, she doesn't show up until like an hour into the movie and is barely in the film to begin with, but her performance is really the only good thing about the film, as she flat out nails her role. The other actors in the film are exactly how you expect them to be, wooden teenager archetypes with nothing to do but be murdered one after another. Its a plot and situation you have seen in horror flicks dozens of times before, and honestly, the film just shows how stale these tropes are truly getting. On top of that, the dialogue and script is atrocious, and incredibly predictable. I had an idea of how the film would go after the opening scene, and it went exactly as I thought it would, which is, at the very least to say, a shame. Besides the horrible dialogue and writing, the film also seems quite generic and seems to take much from other horror flicks of this nature- surprisingly a lot from the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. If you pay close enough attention, you can see just how similar a lot of the visuals, scenery, and setting is to those films, and it is quite painful to see that they couldn't even think of an original style for this film, let alone a story, direction, or script. In the end, Ouija is best left in the basement alone and dusty where it belongs, and truly offers a question as to what lengths Hollywood will go to for a simple buck today.
My Rating: 2.75/10"
" Good movie
",2020-10-15 00:00:00,10,"This movie was better than expected, really scary."
" Predictably fun.
",2020-10-11 00:00:00,6,"As bad as the reviews are and as generic a teeny bopper horror movie this is, I actually had fun. I heard that they reshoot half of the movie but I think they wanted it to be more like the conjuring."
" A little above average in ""teen horror"" category
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,6,"In the beginning I thought it's going to be just another stale teen ghost/slasher film. But when the title screen came I got excited. Then it took me a while to figure out what kind of film am I watching. But I kind of liked it.In general it's quite an average film. There's nothing extraordinary in acting or directing or any field. But it's decent, and the lead actress is good. What I also liked is the overall pace and style. It's not a gimmicky marathon of jump scares. There's not even that much graphic horror. But the overall atmosphere works. The movie also avoids many cliches and annoyances in this genre. So, the best way to describe the movie is that --it's not annoying--. Even though the characters are teenagers, they aren't the typical annoying brats who you wait to die. Well, maybe still not very memorable characters, but it's a lot that they're not terrible.The negative aspect is that the story is quite typical and nothing special. Every now and then something interesting happens that nails my attention back to the screen, and there are a couple of good twists that I didn't expect. I'm afraid the story has some plot holes but I'm not really interested in thinking it more than this.Overall it's a movie that didn't bore me but when it was over I felt quite indifferent. But I don't get the trend of really negative reviews. I think it's massively better than ""Paranormal Activity"", perhaps a little bit better than ""The Grudge"", but in general still a little bit too average to be really memorable. Recommended for those who like slowly paced ghost films and drama-horror with emphasis on subtle tension and atmosphere."
" Nice horror movie..!!
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,6,A group of friends try to play ouija board and they talk to their dead friend...then unexpectedly they went mysterious problm and try to come normal situation..
" Horror-bul
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,1,"This is literally ""horror cliches"" the movie. Besides having teens die because they are having sex, which seems to have stopped being a thing in the 80s, this movie has all the boring and not scary bs we've all seen as thousand times! Zzzzz"
" Boring. Uneventful. Not scary at all.
",2020-08-02 00:00:00,4,"I've never seen either of the Ouija films before, but since I'm stuck at home due to Covid-19, I thought I'd catch up on some horror films I missed out on. Well, I probably should have picked something else to watch because this film was so incredibly boring. At no time during the length of the film did I even care about what happens to the main characters, whether they live or die or whatever. The plot is full of holes. It's ridiculous, uneventful, and....for a horror film....lacks the intensity and tension required to keep you on the edge of your seat in anticipation of what might happen next."
" Lame
",2020-08-02 00:00:00,2,"Not alot of things good about this, Lin Shaye is the only one that always manages to act freaky in anything I've seen her in and acts better in the 5 minutes she's in it than anyone else. The rest is just cheesy and ridiculous, the characters make dumb and illogical choices and seem to cope incredibly well with their loved ones dying off. At no point did I feel any connection to any of the characters not to mention they tried to make everything look so scary it just becomes lame, it didn't do anything for me besides making me roll my eyes. The deaths make very little sense and the story isn't anything special. I recommend to skip this one"
" Not bad
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,7,Ouija inspired movies are usually quite boring and I thought this one was actually really good. Good actors and story.
" Not scary
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,2,"I don't expect much character definition from a horror movie but there wasn't even any stereotypical roles here, the lines could've been spoken by any of actors who struggled with a lame script and absent direction. The plot had promise but was executed poorly. Very few actual scary moments - and the 'climaxes' were just people in costume, which was laughable rather than creepy. I would agree with the other user who advised not to take this too seriously and enjoy it for what it is, but I would argue that it takes itself too seriously for that."
" Have fun
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,5,Don't take this movie seriously. Watch it for what it is and have fun with it.
" Not waste of time, but not something to me proud of either
",2020-05-07 00:00:00,4,"Somehow I don't think the actors are bad, but their acting is. I can't explain it. At first I thought that the movie is awful. At one exact point in the 2nd half I realised that it could turn out being very good, but in the end it blew away the opportunity and finished awfulish."
" Okay slumber party movie
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,5,"""Ouija"" is a harmless horror movie. It plays by the rules but in a PG-13 kind of way. It has a few scares and very little, if any, gore. The cast is fine and they all do a nice job. ""Ouija"" is a good movie for a slumber party of twelve year old girls. They will scream and then sleep well later."
" The main actress is so annoying
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,1,"The main actress Olivia cook (Laine) is the most annoying actress ever. Everything about her is annoying, including her voice. The story is terrible and I have waste 90 minutes I will never get back."
" Death is truly terrifying
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,1,"I'm sure when I'm dead there will be nothing better to do than mess with some dumb kids playing a board game.
Terrible idea, bad execution, Oujia is everything that is wrong with modern horror from Hollywood."
" Not surprising
",2020-03-05 00:00:00,4,"I'm not surprised a film got made about a ouija board, and they can make it really good like they do with origins, but this movie is a terrible, cheap concept."
" Truly creepy and a classic original
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,10,"Recently I saw a movie called They (2002). Just calling something ""They"" is bold and brave. If there isn't a thoroughly thought-out movie backing up the title then the weight of criticism these days would probably sink your life for a while. But They is a fantastic movie, full of chills and jump scares, great tension and exciting moments with tasteful, terrifying effects. I'm happy to report that Ouija is equally good. It's a highly intelligent and well thought out movie. There are many, many carefully chosen scenes that are absolutely classic. When I saw the low score for this movie I honestly got a shock. I think that young people these days have a skewed version of what is cool for them, which is rooted in social media trends and the similar consequent weight of historical opinion. Maybe these days a movie has to imitate something classic from the past to make the grade? Whatever. For me, Ouija was a brilliantly cast movie. The actors were engaging, and contrary to a lot of late teen movies they acted normally and there wasn't any sign of exaggerated bickering. The movie was also sweet in its secondary premise, that of sisters. The effects were really well timed, not over used, really effective and entertaining. I note that several of these actors have gone on to play major roles. You just can't get around the fact that a brave filmmaker has now made a really good movie titled ""Ouija"" and come out the other side, totally unsunk."
" Slapdash doesn't begin to describe it
",2019-11-09 00:00:00,3,"A door closing. An eye changing colour. Another door closing. If any of these things frighten you, you'll still find Ouija boring.The acting is wooden (even from the usually good Olivia Cooke), every plot development is telegraphed and predictable, and the whole thing reads like a first draft full of placeholder dialogue.After watching it, I was completely unsurprised to find that half the film had been re-shot and the last 20 minutes completely added from scratch.It's a film with no scares, no good dialogue, no interesting ideas, nothing at all. It's completely and totally vacuous."
" Boring And Cliched, Ouija Could Have Been Better!!
",2019-10-08 00:00:00,3,"While I appreciate the work involved in such a production, its quite clear from reading the reviews of many others on this film that it wasn't just me that found Ouija kinda pants!While not the worst movie in the world, Ouija does dip a toe in the 'so-bad-its-good' waters... For such a big production, the writing is often hilarious (for all the wrong reasons) and at times just plain awful - but then again this comes from the same guy who penned the forgettable Boogeyman film and The Knowing starring Ridiculous Cage!The same guy directs, with this being his directorial debut, and as a director of 7 indie features myself, I often wonder how these guys get such a break - then deliver a sub-par film.To be honest, there really is nothing new here at all in regards to horror so I would say skip this and go straight to its prequel, Ouija: Origin of Evil, for a better film!!Ironically, Ouija lacks any spirit..."

",2019-05-16 00:00:00,4,"When I saw that Lin Shaye was in this movie (from the Insidious series) I thought that meant it would be as good. It wasn't ! It's ok I suppose with a few stock surprise moments but it took so long to get going that I ended up reading my work emails halfway through. Unlike the Conjuring movies and Insidious which hold the tension throughout and have truly horrifying 'ghosts', this was a disappointing watch. Ok if you've nothing better to do. It's all a bit predictable."
" No great shakes.
",2019-04-21 00:00:00,5,"A mostly silly slab of horror with a cast of beautifully groomed American youths, which makes it look strikingly like High School Musical, only with screaming."

",2019-04-19 00:00:00,2,"There's not a lot to say about this movie. It really just features the bare minimum in terms of acting, plot, cinematography, etc. I didn't hate it, I just think the best way to describe it is ""forgettable""."

" Not scary, story missing lots of explanations, but good parts here are there
",2018-12-25 00:00:00,5,Ouija is not scary period but it does deliver some creative kills but I feel like the movie is missing big parts that explain stuff if your looking for a really scary horror film don't go to Ouija it's not a really good horror movie yes there are some creative kills but that's all really
" HI FRIEND

Where can I get Christmas lights that strong?I enjoyed the second killing when our teen does a Charpy V-notch test on the bathroom sink. The ""doink"" sound had me laughing.I particularly liked the first three outlined aspects. The last one, ""teens fight back"" could have been better written.

" Ouija was more disposable than a freshly moistened squeegee.
",2018-10-27 00:00:00,3,"Look, I don't mind the odd forgettable mass produced Hollywood horror. Some of them uphold a unique charm that makes them perfect for a friendly film night with deliciously cheesy pizza. However when the scares are based around a wooden board game with characters undertaking the most stupid actions ever, well, you start to wonder why this was ever a good idea. After the apparent suicide of one of their friends, a group of students attempt to communicate with her through a spirit board, unknowingly awakening another presence instead. One point for Shaye just being in the film (God damn love her), one point for Cooke attempting to save this disaster with some genuine decent acting and the last point for the spirit demon girl crawling through the ventilation tunnel faster than Sonic the Hedgehog (na-uh, no thank you). That's it. The problem lies with its ludicrous, unfocused, monotonous, dull, derivative, unmemorable and predictable plot. You could say the film has 99 problems, but Shaye ain't one. A haunted board game just isn't scary. Setting up the rules and explaining how the game works just adds to its absurdity and wastes precious time that could be better utilised in actually developing a coherent plot. The friends can't act. The ouija board has more personality than them. Damn. Their purpose is just to be expendable as the demon spirit stitches their mouths together. Oh, but don't worry. You never actually see it. God forbid! Just them staring at the camera with bad visual effects on their faces. An alternative rebellious sister for no apparent reason other than to say the inconsequential line ""Yo! Can you hear me? Signal's real bad, only got like one bar"". M'kay I'm leaving now. The ""plot"" is constantly explained as if we're dumb, in particularly the scenes with Shaye and her ""tenacious niece"". And to top it all off, she STILL uses the board game at the end of the film!? Are you mad bro? Stupid characters, stupid board game, stupid film. Be right back I'm just going to find the strongest fairy lights to hang myself with."
" Ouija
",2018-09-01 00:00:00,5,"A fairly unoriginal plot with the odd jolt, a couple of good set pieces and a fine lead performance from Olivia Cooke and a nice cameo from Lyn Shaye(Insidious films)."
" Don't play with it alone
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,7,"I've always loved everything about the spirit world and, of course, films about it.
I can talk about a lot of great movies that have to do with the spirit world (like the Rite with Anthony Hopkins - and whoever did not see it, you have to go and see) and of course there are also some OK films. 
But you can not say that the world of spirits is not an interesting subject that has many aspects.So in the case of a Ouija, it is much like Paranormal activity - the first film actually happens after the events we discover in the second film.In this case, about a year ago, I first saw the second film from 2016 (Ouija: The Origin of Evil). And it actually tells about the events that preceded the first film of 2014.
But it really doesn't matter what order you see the movies. In any case they are both good films (the movie from 2016 is a little better than the first one).In conclusion, I loved and warmly recommend to anyone who has not seen the second film yet, to see it this one first and then to move on to the 2nd."
" Not as Good as the Prequel / Sequel
",2018-08-05 00:00:00,4,"I originally gave this movie a rating of 7. I thought there were some good creepy moments and liked the storyline continuing from previous occupants. Then I made the mistake of watching the prequel / sequel first and re-watching the original second. Big mistake. The Origin writers had no idea what the first movie's history was. They did an awful job trying to give us more backstory on the Origin of Evil. But what they did do was have a wonderful child actress, Lulu Wilson, who was eerie and creepy and unsettling, something the original Ouija did not have. None of the cast stood out or acted well. It must have been the directing, because I have seen some of the cast in other things and liked them. This movie pales in comparison to Origin, but Origin sucks because it did not take the history told in this story and use it correctly. My recommendation, if you like one of these movies, don't watch the other. And if you want to watch both, watch them years apart so you don't remember the inaccuracies. I changed my rating to a 4."
" Is anybody there?
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,2,"'Ouija' moderately drew me into seeing it, with a cool poster/cover, an intriguing if not particularly original premise and as someone with a general appreciation for horror. That it was low-budget, which from frequent personal experience is rarely a good sign due to that there are so many poor ones out there, made me though apprehensive as well as the low rating and poor reviews here. Yet another film seen recently unfortunately, hence some reiteration because the exact same strengths and flaws those films have are present here, that to me was incredibly disappointing considering its potential which it doesn't do anywhere near enough with. 'Ouija' is terrible, with a plethora of problems (huge ones too) and doesn't do enough with its potential, which was hardly small. There is really nothing to recommend other than Olivia Cooke trying her best and actually being pretty okay.Unfortunately, 'Ouija' is shot and edited so poorly, looking like a school project shot on a shaky camera or a phone by an unsteady hand, and the drab and overly-dark colours. It was very clear that the film was made in a rush with no care or enthusiasm. In particular, the camera work was a nauseous assault on the eyes with its excessive amateurish-ness and the lighting is far too dark and a lot of the time inappropriately so.Going on further to the negatives, the story does feel paper thin, disjointed and over-stretched and some of it feels vague, under-explained in the last third where the film especially became duller, more predictable, more senseless and less scary. Too many characters are too sketchy and with nowhere near enough to make one want to endear to them. Their annoying and illogical decision making and behaviours frustrates and are overdone.Making the film feel bland and forgettable with not enough heart put into it. The effects are ropy at best, the sound quality is obvious and utilised cheaply (being too loud in the build ups and people's reactions) and it's best not mentioning the elsewhere lumbering, awkward and histrionic acting that shows a huge indifference to the situation and what is going on.Dialogue can be stilted and rambling, with lots of clich√©s, lots of unintentional humour and no depth whatsoever, while the pace goes to a standstill very quickly and drags on forever with very little going on worth caring about and useless padding, never recovering. Found too many the supposedly shocking moments not surprising or scary and the supposedly creepy atmosphere dreary, due to the excessive obviousness, a lot of dumb and vague moments and explanations and the lack of tension and suspense. Would not have minded the lack of originality (the film is extremely derivative and in a dumbed and watered down way) if the story and atmosphere were at least alright in execution, in reality they were both incredibly poorly done.A lot of 'Ouija' often nonsensical and confusing character motivations, while too many of the things to make you jump or shocked are far from creative or scary and are pretty tame. Most of those attempted in fact are very contrived and will make one roll the eyes than jump. The film often fails to make sense, is very by the numbers and there is no imagination.There is not enough threat, and what there is of it tends to be used poorly, it is completely unimaginative and more odd than creepy, completely failing to show any sense of horror or creativity. Everything here is neither creative, suspenseful or nail-biting and much of it absurd. Some badly sagging momentum too. The direction is leaden, with an all over the place visual style, and like their heart was not in it or ill at ease, with the non-existent chemistry between the characters and actors coming over as constantly random. This is very dreary and amateurish stuff that fails to be scary, interesting or easy to follow, with the deaths being un-creative, too easily foreseeable and lame in execution.In conclusion, very poorly done. 2/10 Bethany Cox"

",2018-06-18 00:00:00,5,"A supernatural tale realistically done, with a theme we can all relate to: losing someone we love. Thanks to a good cast and a believable plot, this was scary as hell. Great visuals, as well."
" Derivative ghost story, unremarkable teen horror.
",2018-02-08 00:00:00,3,"The only thing I know about Ouija-boards is that the name is derived from of a composition of the French and Dutch words for ""yes"" (""oui"" and ""ja"") and that they were originally created as ordinary board games for family entertainment. The fact that Ouija boards grew out to become symbol for the macabre, spiritualism and horror is pretty good marketing, if you ask me! As made clear by the title, a Ouija board also forms the central gimmick in this film, but like all skeptical horror fans know, a good gimmick doesn't necessarily guarantee a good movie! ""Ouija"" is an incredibly uninspired, lame and overly sentimental PG13 ghost story that too obviously steals its plot ideas from other films. This could easily be a sequel in the ""Insidious"" franchise, except that the Ouija board replaces the human spiritual medium (but Lin Shaye is still present), while the death sequences could come straight out of a ""Final Destination"" sequel (notably the freak accident in the bathroom). After fooling around with a Ouija board she found in the attic, a teenage girl inexplicable commits suicide. Her friends, and particularly her BFF Layne, refuse to accept that a vivid and joyful young girl like Debbie played with the idea of ending her own life, so they gather around to seek contact with their friend via the same Ouija board. They quickly discover the board is connected to an unresolved missing girl case from the 1950s and put their own lives at risk by unleashing malevolent souls. ""Ouija"" is a strictly by-the-numbers and commercial horror effort, with predictable boo-moments and fake scares at the most foreseeable moments. The teen protagonists are admittedly less stereotypical and annoying than usually the case in this sort of films, but still you don't feel too much empathy for them. The lead girl, Olivia Cooke, is cute and she surely can act, but she's probably also smart enough to realize that her role in the series ""Bates Motel"" is a more valuable addition on her resume. There isn't any gore (duh, PG13) and the make-up effects are weak. My 8-year-old son walked in during one of the supposedly scariest moments, but he wasn't the least bit upset."
" Don't bother with this ~~ it's amateur boring rubbish
",2018-02-07 00:00:00,2,"NON-NEIN (that's the opposite of OUI-JA you see) 
This is a terribly dull flick, the sort of ""horror"" film that abound these days, with no idea of plot, timing, acting, cinematography, acting, or anything else. And WHY OH WHY do young girls have that whining gravelly voice??? UGH!!!"
" Anti-Anti Depressant
",2017-12-17 00:00:00,5,"4.8/10 The ""How To Not Make a Horror Movie"" documentary guide is a complete blast! Its both entertaining and insightful nature is crucial for the creative growth of every filmmaker and much needed to understand the sophisticated fabric of overwhelming mediocrity. The 7-Dimensional characters are deep as a straight road and the story beats beat the living crap out of your desire to live. It's not either good enough or bad enough to be entertaining. A horrifically unforgettable script and earned horror moments that will leave you wondering if this movie even existed the second you stop watching it. The acting is so seamless, you could never guess that the actors had a gun pointed to their heads. Watch the extras people! Scientists are still researching the sheer brilliancy and depth of the lore make that give a magical, mystical feel to the world of monsters and spirits and some other garbage I don't care about. The world of Oyjia is built with such exact precision and haunting mythology, that Warcraft can just go and suck a... Well, that's another story for another day folks, the only fault about the movie is my current devastating desire to watch the next 15 sequels such as: ""Ou 2 Ija 2"", ""Oujia: Haunted Boongalo"", ""Ouijja vs Jumanji: Dawn of Civil War"", ""Ouija: An Oujia Space Oddysey"" and the much anticipated x-rated spin-off: ""Oucumja: Parahuge Cocks"""
" Ouija
",2017-12-07 00:00:00,3,"I had heard the title for this scary movie a number of times, it was only after seeing the trailer for the sequel, Origin of Evil, that I decided to watch it, despite being panned by critics. Basically childhood friends Laine Morris (Afra Sophia Tully) and Debbie Galardi (Claire Beale) used to play with an Ouija board, now in the present day, Laine (Olivia Cooke) throws the board in the fire, burning it. However, the board reappears in Debbie's room, she is possessed and hangs herself, Laine and her boyfriend Trevor (Daren Kagasoff), younger sister Sarah (Ana Coto), friend Isabelle (Bianca A. Santos), and Debbie's boyfriend Pete (Douglas Smith) attend her funeral. After the wake, the five friends find the Ouija board, Laine suggests using it communicate with Debbie's spirit, strange things happen during their session, including Pete smashing his head into the mirror. Soon after, the friends start finding the phrase ""hi friend"" (a message communicated during the Ouija board session) written in various places, including in a car window, on a tunnel wall, on a desk and on Laine's computer. Thinking it is Debbie communicating with them, they have another board session, but they realise they have actually come into contact with another spirit of the house. Laine looks through the board's planchette and sees the image of a little girl with her mouth sewn shut, the girl warns her mother is coming, then she sees an old woman, and the group flee. Laine later learns that Debbie found the Ouija board in her attic and played with it alone, then Isabelle is possessed and killed, she smashes her head and cracks her skull open on the bathroom sink. Laine and Pete decide to investigate the house, in the attic they finds photographs belonging to the previous residents, and searching the family history, they find out the little girl, Doris (Sunny May Allison) went missing, her mother was suspected of the disappearance. Laine finds Doris's now elderly sister, Paulina (Insidious's Lin Shaye), committed to a psychiatric hospital, she explains that her mother was a medium, and used Doris's as a vessel for the dead to speak through, the mother went mad, stitched up Doris's mouth, and killed herself. Paulina tells Laine about a secret room in the house, where she must find Doris's hidden body and unstitch her mouth in order to banish the mother. The remaining friends return to the Galardi house, Laine finds the corpse and cuts the mouth stitches, Doris's spirit appears to chase the ghost of the mother away, but shortly after, Pete is possessed and is killed at home, appearing as a ghost with his mouthy sewn shut. Returning to Paulina, Laine realises the old woman intentionally lied, Doris is actually the evil entity, the mother was trying to stop the friends summoning her with the board. The Morris's grandmother, Nona (Vivis Colombetti), advises the sisters destroy Doris's body and the Ouija board at the same time, Trevor is then killed, being possessed and thrown into the swimming pool, filled with plastic wrapping, he is trapped and drowns. Laine and Sarah return to the Galardi house cellar, Sarah is captured by Doris and prepares to sew her mouth shut, but the spirit's attention is drawn by Laine playing with the Ouija board. Doris attempts to possess her, but Debbie's spirit appears, helps save Laine and defeat Doris, her body is thrown into the furnace, and Laine throws the Ouija board. The paranormal activity is over, but in her bedroom, Laine finds the planchette has mysteriously appeared, she looks through its glass hole, the picture fades to black, it is unclear if she saw anything. Also starring Matthew Settle as Mr. Morris, Robyn Lively as Mrs. Galardi, Claudia Katz Minnick as Mother and Morgan Peter Brown as Young Sarah. Everyone has tried having a seance in some way at some point, for fun or for reason, this film is based on the Hasbro ""talking board"" idea, unfortunately it is full of flaws, the contrived shocks are minimal, there is little gore and imagination with the deaths, and the story is predictable, that popular seance question ""is anybody there?"" could easily be aimed at the audience, let's hope the prequel is better, a pretty boring supernatural horror. Adequate!"
" Has a lot in common with the worst movies from the nineties
",2017-11-22 00:00:00,3,Ouija is not even a film worth considering. These are the type of horror films they release every year to capitalize on the small box office competition and to lure unsuspecting audience members into thinking they are watching a quality horror film. Far from quality. This is the type of crap they made in the nineties by the barrel full. Do not watch.
" Really boring movie, without story
",2017-11-15 00:00:00,3,"Yep, that's it. Ouija was (by me) one of the worst horror movies ever made. Movie has no story. Literally no story! No deeper meaning, just flat silliness. Music was also not worth. Only thing, that you can enjoy in this movie, are characters. They are really sympathetic. Main character is really cute and sexy, but so STUPID... From beginning of the movie she is acting super dumb and her decisions are so illogical, but get back to the movie. I have nothing more to say. Well, I do not recommend you movie Ouija, but it's just my personal opinion. Fear With You"
" Unappealing
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,2,"The first thing that hit me hard was an unappealing cast. I don't mind ""B"" films or ""B"" actors - if they are so bad, they are good but the cast and film - terrible.I love the idea behind this movie - the Ouija Board! - but the way the movie played out and the actors are non-appealing to me. They sound like valley girls (believe me I have fun spoofing them but these gals I found repulsed me).The story - what story? One girl hangs herself in the beginning after burning her witch board and then her best friend upset for a scene or two. The best friend then gathers the rest of the friends to talk to her dead friend, a demon shows up and the dead ghostly friend saves the day. I could have wrote this one.Maybe I wanted more from this film, maybe I expected a really good film because Universal usually has good movies but this one doesn't do it for me.2/10"
" A decent horror which is pretty nicely done
",2017-09-07 00:00:00,6,"First of all, I would begin by saying that IMDb ratings & reviews are so unreliable that I decided not to watch/reject a movie anymore because of some stupid ratings and reviews. This movie actually gives you that general message of how dealing with an Ouija board foolishly could ruin your life. Nevertheless, it's all about the direction of a horror movie which makes it different and appealing and this one is quite remarkable. Ouija (2014) is a much better horror than Ouija: the origin of evil (2016) which you would find to have got a rating of 6, whereas you would see only 4.5 for Ouija (2014). A lot of people criticized it to be a children's movie (just because playing with the Ouija Board doesn't make it so) or did not quite like the young girls and boys involved with the Ouija board activities here. However, it would be ridiculous to see a bunch of old people dealing with an Ouija board, isn't it? It's very natural to see a group of young would fall for this trap and by mistake could bring something satanic/demonic. You could also find Lin Shaye (who played the role of Elise Rainier in the Insidious series) in this movie who perfectly fits into this kind of horror climax which Ouija delivered. I have no idea how trash movies like Triangle (2009) or average horror with absolutely zero scary scenes such as The Witch (2015) got such high ratings and positive reviews whereas for Ouija (2014), the case is not so. It has the ability to scare you quite a few number of times which you would appreciate while watching a horror. Pure and simple. We don't always like to watch a complicated horror movie which ends in such a way that we have to go to Google and find out the explanations of the stories and their endings so that the spent time would be worth watching it. Why so much effort to understand a movie! Non-sense! I would say, if you really love horror which could easily happen to your day-to-day lives or you love to get scared a few number of times and especially love an excellent climax at the end then this movie is worth-watching. Please ignore the stupid ratings & reviews of a horror movie here on IMDb and watch the trailer by yourself, if it seems convincing, then make your own decision rather than going for reviews of some immature young generation who have only learnt watching horror movies for a few years."
" A good movie to fall asleep who has insomnia.
",2017-08-16 00:00:00,2,"The Ouija board is probably one of the most mysterious instruments of spiritualism, and its ease of acquisition makes it specially appealing to teenagers who likes the supernatural. I have never used it but some of my friends with a taste for these themes have used it or know it well enough to ensure that its not a good idea to use it. Here, in Portugal, its better known as ""Jogo do Copo"" (literally Game of the Glass, because the triangular pointer is often swapped for a glass cup that has to be broken after the game). Basically, my friends told me that any spirit or demon can answer the call and deceive the players, and the board is the source of several possessions or supernatural disturbances. I don't know if that's true, I'm telling what I've been told, but I will not pay to see if it's true or not. As the people use to say here, ""prudent man has died old and suspicious man is still alive"". But let's talk about the movie, that's what matters.The film begins with a good horror premise: an Ouija board that is at the origin of the mysterious death of a young woman. The problem is that the whole plot that develops later is of an awful predictability. In terms of scares, the film also fails roundly. Neither the usual sound and visual tricks were able to make me jump from the seat because I was able to foresee them. The tension, usually compulsory in a horror film, is so absent that it can make us fall asleep. The characters are empty, devoid of personality or some feature that makes us like them, and that makes it indifferent whether they live or die. Some are truly stupid and we just don't care about them. The cast is composed of actors with no talent or experience, who deliver wooden performances, unrealistic and without remarkable merit. Finally, its necessary to talk about CGI, visual and sound effects: although the movie is visually regular, the computer effects are very boring and low, probably because of the low budget."
" Was better after watching the 2016 movie
",2017-07-25 00:00:00,5,"In the scheme of horror movies watching this as a stand alone it was a bit disjointed. It is really a movie geared toward teens to 20 somethings. There were few interactions with adults and the film focused on high schoolers almost exclusively. The second movie was better made and far more creepy and psychologically disturbing. This movie did tie into the other story and if seen after made more sense. I see a lot of horror movies and there are so many that fall below average range for acting quality or storyline. I didn't feel this one was poorly crafted or acted, the characters just weren't very developed and the plot was too disjointed. But they did have a few 'scares' in the mix."
" A good horror movie? That Would Be Two Knocks For No
",2017-07-11 00:00:00,4,"Ouija is a horror film that starts out decently but ultimately has very little merit apart from some pleasant camera work and a few reasonable effects. But, you expect more suspense and creepy ambiance from a ghost film, and Ouija just becomes another predictable vengeful spirit affair (with a bit of Final Destination chucked in for good measure - just without the invention and imagination of those movies), and a turgid one at that. As such, the pacing is slow, and the feeling evoked in the viewer is apt for a movie about the dead as it is totally lifeless. In the final analysis then, Ouija is a dull film and should be retitled Nonnein."
" Average Jumpy Horror
",2017-07-02 00:00:00,6,"A couple of years late with this review. Never mind, but after reading the synopsis and watching the trailer. Looked like something I'd enjoy without having to concentrate too much. And that's exactly what you get with Ouija and some decent jumpy bits too. The story line is pape thin and accompanied by some very awkward acting at times but it holds its own till the end. A good flick to pick and watch on a rainy Sunday afternoon."
" There's Worse Believe that
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,4,Just rented a movie called OUIJA 3 and couldn't find one redeeming quality about it. This movie is NOT affiliated with that one. This movie isn't terrible but still pretty forgettable slightly better than its predecessor so that's a plus. It's plot is pretty obvious so I won't give you a spoiler alert trying to explain its premise. What I will say is the quality of this movie is considerably better than two independent releases playing on the OUIJA namesake. This movie may be worth your time if you have some time to kill sadly nothing more
" Hi Friend This Is Your Basic Unoriginal Above Average Horror...
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,6,"The most amazing thing about this movie is that one of the production companies is the toy company Hasbro, who manufactures the Ouija board. I find it funny and interesting that they use the movie to push their product... something that will contact the dead and will probably cause your gruesome death.This is an enjoyable, though a pretty basic, horror movie. Best friends, Laine and Debbie, play with the Ouija as children obeying the rules that they should be courteous and never play alone. Years later, Debbie uses the board by herself and strange things start to happen, which results in her growing distant from her friends and boyfriend. Using the ouija in solitary leads to her violent death.Laine agrees to house sit for Debbies distraught parents after the funeral as they need to get away. She realises the board had a part to play in her friend's death so rallies the others to help here prove the idea. Of course, this is a bad idea and the spirit they contact starts to plague them in their lives. From here on in, it's a race to save themselves and to solve the mystery of the origin of the board.There's nothing really new in this film that hasn't been covered before. The acting of the entire cast is above average and makes the film enjoyable to watch, as is the direction from Stiles White, who co-wrote the story with Juliet Snowden. Since this is a Blumhouse production there's a cameo from Lin Shaye, who, as always is good in her role (though I will always remember her as the landlady in Kingpin).This is one of those films that's worth watching if it comes onto telly and there's nothing better on. At least worth watching once, though I don't think I'll watch it again... though I will watch the sequel when it's on or if I can borrow it from friends."
