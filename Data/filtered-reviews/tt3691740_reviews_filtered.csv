" A magical little movie
",2021-04-10 00:00:00,7,"This movie ticks all the boxes for a wonderful family film. Endearing characters, magic, and kindness on the big screen."
" All very cute and charming, adorable ...
",2021-03-17 00:00:00,8,"Think of a cute, naive and captivating little creature, the giant good friend is, perfect graphics, reminded me of the equally beautiful ""Jack, the Giant Hunter"" and a mix of ""My Friend, the Dragon"", Chuckubobrinha's Nojinho, yuck... Charismatic queen, delicate Rebecca Hall, all very cute and charming, adorable ..."
" Small children's movie
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,6,Was hard to keep watching but waited for Rebecca Hall (towards the last quarter of the movie).
" If you haven't read the book, don't leave a review, especially a negative one
",2021-01-12 00:00:00,8,"Please refrain from leaving a bad review of this movie if you haven't read the book - that would be completely unfair - also this movie is obviously supposed to be watched in 3D so again, what with all the complaining about the graphics? Great movie adaptation to an awesome childhood book that probably wasn't an easy feet!"
" a Magnificent Modern Family Film for years to come
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,7,"If your a fan of Roald Dahl's most magnificent works, then you'll enjoy this movie! this movie definitely has the magic and enchantment of ""the Neverending Story"", ""Where the Wild Things Are"", ""Charlotte's Web"" and ""Avatar"". the CG special effects are amazing and the casting is marvelous with Mark Rylance delivers as the title character, the fart jokes are okay in my book and truly Melissa Matheson's final screenplay to date after her death. this is a remarkable adaptation of this classic by master storyteller Roald Dahl along with the 1989 animated adaptation by Cosgrove Hall that he kinda enjoyed it (before his death a year later), and so if you have kids in your family, check this one out!"
" Enjoyable to watch
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,6,"Sophie is an orphan girl suffering from insomnia, one night she gets abducted by a giant. Naturally scared at first, she soon realizes that the Giant is actually quite gentle and charming. As their friendship grows, Sophie's presence attracts the unwanted attention of other unfriendly human-eating Giants. After travelling to London, Sophie and the BFG must convince Queen Elizabeth to help them get rid of all the bad giants once and for all.
Mark Rylance is great as the titular BFG and Ruby Barnhill is convincing as the little Sophie. The relationship built between the characters is heart warming. The story is fine, but not particularly memorable. It has a good deal of heart, and the visuals are enticing. The plot, however, is slow in the first half and quite underwhelming, and by the time it reaches the climax, it's already predictable and a bit of a letdown.
On the whole, the film is beautiful to look at as the visuals effects of the Giants are stunning. The score from John Williams is captivating and memorable, the cinematography is amazing and has a great camera-work. This is an entertaining, harmless, and sometimes exciting adventure for the whole family to enjoy."
" OMG people are so far off on this flawless MASTERPIECE, it's a phenomenal visual work.of art!!!!!
",2020-12-02 00:00:00,10,"Here's another example of people just not getting it!! This movie is in the class of masterpieces like wizard of oz, wall-e, beauty and the beast, etc. Its a absolute must see for ALL families. I cant imagine for the life of me how someone could give this Visually stunning film a 5 let alone a 1 or 2 like I saw. Its brilliant and if you're lucky enough to be among the intelligent few who own a 3d tv its magical!!, I thank the universe for the intelligent movie audience in Europe that love 3d like I do so i get to watch 3d movies using a region b player!!! BRAVO mr Spielberg on another work of art , in every way and rylance as the bfg deserves an oscar!!!! People for the love of everything good WAKE UP!!!!!!!!!"
" Simply Delightful!
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,10,"First off, I'm not a huge children's movie fan, but this one was just so charming and cute I couldn't help but like it. The real star is the BFG. The funny way he talks and the emotions on his face really made the movie for me. The little girl does a pretty good job as well.This isn't the kind of movie you watch for the story. It's simple enough, but does the job. It's more for the interaction between the girl and the giant, and in that department the movie delivers. Sure there were some childish jokes, but there were plenty of other moments that made me laugh out loud without involving body functions.I don't get why so many people hated on this movie. Where they expecting Schindler's List? This wasn't that kind of Spielberg Movie. It was more about the interaction of a child and magical friend, akin to ET - and while it may not be quite as good, I still got a lot of enjoyment out of it. If you don't think you're going to be a stick in the mud about it, go ahead and give it a watch. You might end up being surprised at how much you like it, just like I was."
" Loved it.
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,10,I read the book when I was a child. When I saw the movie I was that child again. I absolutely loved it.
" Scrumptious
",2020-10-23 00:00:00,9,"I can't understand the low ratings. This is way better than any kids movie out there. It beats Charlie & the chocolate factory. It's way better than the two Malificent movies, the awful James & the giant peach or the new Cinderella movies. I'm an adult and I love it. I watch this at least once a month. The only movie that comes close to being as good as this is Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland which has crazy off the hook adult humor that couldn't possibly be as appealing to kids as this. I just don't get it. I gave this a 9. Why it's rated a 6 is beyond me. What's not to like?"
" Are kidnapping giants nice? Well I don't think so.
",2020-10-03 00:00:00,1,"This is one of the many giant plot holes that this movie has. BFG knew that the giant country is a very dangerous place for humans because the boy he kidnapped before Sophie was eaten by the other giants. For the same reason, it made no sense Sophie wanted to return to the giant country. BFG also blamed the abduction for not wanting to reveal the giants' existence but had no problem showing up at the palace and mingling with the queen. There are simply too many of these illogical plot holes I could not stand. It deserves one star for the CGI though."
" Utterly charming and heartwarming. Loved it.
",2020-09-27 00:00:00,10,"Im surprised this film has an average review score so low!
From the outset, I was encaptured in the story, having not known the story before.
I couldnt work out throughout who was playing the BFG and I found the voice and his way of speaking so gorgeous that I wanted him to be my friend.
This is a film that adults can lose themselves in and relive childhood fantasy again.
It is sweet, beautifully set, fabulous costume and a wonderful story.
A totally feelgood, tear-jerker with some belly laughs too. A triumph."
" The best fairy movie I've ever seen !
",2020-09-15 00:00:00,10,"I remember I saw this movie with my little sister when it released in the cinema. To be honest, my expectations about this movie were not the best ones, but when I went deeper into the plot and characters I really fell in love with it. What I liked the most was the way in which the main characters "" the giant "" & ""the girl"" interact in the story, it is a lovely and magical friendship that is immersed into action. At the same time, I liked so much the roles they play in the story because they are so charming. Throughout the movie, I could perceive the girl represents the innocence and courage that children of her same age posses in childhood. And the giant talks in a particular way that made me feel so glad. Also, the jokes that are told there are fantastic! So, I think this is why I got engaged with this fairy movie."
" Speilberg does Dahl - and he does it well.
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,7,"This is one of those stories that, like ""James and the Giant Peach"" reminds me fondly of being very, very young! It's a gentle tale of a young orphan ""Sophie"" (Ruby Barnhill) who espies a giant (Mark Rylance) from her bedroom window. He abducts her, takes her to his home and tells her she must remain there for ever because he has seen her! Initially frightened, she realises he is actually quite a kindly old soul who is bullied by the even bigger giants - the ones who kidnap other children and eat them all up. She and the BFG enlist the help of the Queen (Penelope Wilton) to put a stop to their mischief. This is a fun, charming adaptation with good animation to support the performances from Rylance and Barnhill. As with Dahl's original story, there is some humour in the dialogue and the characterisations are thoroughly engaging."
" A boring movie that drags on.
",2020-06-04 00:00:00,1,Spielberg has let us down. Just fart jokes and very boring scenes that lead nowhere.
" BFG stands for Boring Flavorless Garbage
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,1,"This is definitely the worst Spielberg I have seen so far (and I have seen 26 his movies)... The movie is so boring even kids won't find it entertaining, nothing is happening for the first 40 minutes, the CGI looks awful, somehow queen of England gets involved??? This movie is all over the place and it's far from prime Spielberg."
" The journey is about so much more than the shape and color of the paths we've walked.
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,5,"Steven Spielberg's doggedly loyal adaptation of a Roald Dahl classic, sadly, doesn't have much oomph. It's the narrow tale of an orphaned girl, abducted and (eventually) befriended by a steep, thin, heart-of-gold giant, who goes on to discover they have an awful lot in common. Originally a short story that was later expanded into a full novel, I can't remember the book feeling nearly as thin and stretched as the film does. It's got a nice message, some vague warm-fuzzies, a fair piece of physical acting (unsurprisingly, given the cast's stage credentials), but the central relationship is missing some intangibles and the looming threat never actually seems all that important. Spielberg and company took the sugar-coated route, skipping much of the menace that might have earned the film a stiffer rating, and along the way they slashed out its teeth. The dreamy, surreal CG is problematic, too. Often the fairy tale renderings seem more sharp and textured than the live actors, as if they're occupying two different realities in the same space, and that took me out of the scenery on several occasions. Mildly entertaining, but too effects-reliant for its own good. The journey is about so much more than the shape and color of the paths we've walked."
" Long-lost childlike innocence
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,8,"Exquisite children's film, long-lost childlike innocence, children's clear eyes, infinite pure world. While many people find the film too old-fashioned and orthodox, the fact that such cliches can be so entertaining is part of Steven spielberg's genius."
" Disney didn't ruin a book for once!
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,10,"It's sad this wasn't a success at the box office or with most critics. It's sad that most people forgot this even came out. It's sad that Disney chose to not advertise for this movie and it suffered greatly as a result, because this movie is amazing! It's Steven Speilberg directing a movie based on a book written by Roald Dahl with a screenplay by the late Melissa Mathison. It's a win win win situation. The CGI is some of the best (if not the best) CGI I've ever seen. The attention to detail is astounding! The little liver spots, arm hairs, and pores on the BFG are so detailed and beautiful. The film is a fun, innocent little fairy tale romp that is perfect for kids. The story isn't very fluid, (to be honest I don't think I could tell you the linear plot. If you asked me what it was about I'd say it's about a girl and her giant friend who have various adventures), but that's the beauty of it. It's such a simple plot that really has nothing going on, but it's so fun and whimsical you love every minute of it. It's a great way to kill some time if you have it. Pop it in, turn off your brain, and enjoy the wonder that is this film. It took me back to my days of childhood innocence and wonder and I look forward to revisiting this movie many more times in the future.
Grade: A+. 10/10 5/5 stars"
" As always, as always
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,10,"Thanks for not making this movie into a horror movie😂At first, I was a little afraid that it would become a horror film.I like the part where the little girl is wrapped in a blanket. Night is the best time for adventure.A very beautiful and fantastic film. Highly recommended!"
" Love it
",2020-01-25 00:00:00,10,Absolutely love this movie! Fabulous. Love the plot. The actors did great.
" Mark Rylance is terrific
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,7,"Steven Spielberg's 'The BFG' is a definite improvement on the previous adaptation by Brian Cosgrove, as you'd expect.Mark Rylance is terrific as the Big Friendly Giant, with Ruby Barnhill performing well as Sophie. However, the film lost all momentum with Penelope Wilton & Co.'s arrival - from then until the end, it became rather boring."
" Perfection
",2019-12-22 00:00:00,10,"When Spielberg is on form no other director can capture the magic of childhood better. Mark rylance brings a huge amount of heart to the bfg - in fact if this film doesn't fill your heart with warmth and wonder then I'd suggest booking in with your GP to check it's still there. Visually it's a stunner but actually it's the message beneath which prevails, Roald Dahl remains one of our best authors and this is one of the most successful adaptations of his works to date- up there with the Paddington Films for me - a real treat!"
" Not much good what i ex[ect..
",2019-12-17 00:00:00,6,It is totally based on book...if you reed book then you will feel like creep..i will not recommend this if you have already read this story in books...if you are new then go for it...
" A very sweet story of friendship and courage no matter how small (or large) you are.
",2019-10-24 00:00:00,9,I loved this story. It brought a smile to my face though most of its running. It is definitely a bit of fun for the entire family...
" Too young?
",2019-09-21 00:00:00,6,Put it on for my 4 year old. Didn't keep his attention very long. Beautifully made film. Try again once he's a wee bit older.
" The BFG
",2019-09-08 00:00:00,10,"Charming, aesthetically pleasing, well composed, and most of all, giant-hearted."
" Very enduring.
",2019-06-17 00:00:00,9,I was completely captivated by the story and the BFG's gentle and sweet spirit. Also his facial expressions. Very enjoyable.
" Ok
",2019-06-02 00:00:00,6,"A bit slow, I didn't like the Queen stuff, good effects though and Mark Rylance's performance was so warm."
" It's not a bad film. I totally enjoyed.
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,10,"A lot of people are saying that this film is totally bad. But as for me, it's one of the best live action films from Disney. The story is simple, but it doesn't make me bored. I totally watched the whole film from beginning to end. Some scenes are really touchable (especially the final scene. I cried). Some scenes are funny. Some are different. Some are cute. So, it is that kind of films which can give you many feelings.I really like that scene where BFG have breakfast with the Queen. The way they present dishes is so cute and funny. But what I don't understand is why the Queen is so kind to adopt Sophie and let her stay in the palace like a princess. Yes, I know that she helped to defeat the other giants, but is it enough to praise her and let her be a princess? Then why don't they do the same to BFG? I mean give him a nice place to stay rather than let him stay in his old house in the forest?Overall is that don't read bad reviews. Just watch it and then judge because it's totally watchable and so much fun."
" A kind of magic, but...
",2019-05-14 00:00:00,6,"Interesting, but not as magical as expected. The BFG starts very well, and even has its moments of greatness, but it finally fails to live up to expectations."
" Not bad but missing the magic of the book
",2019-03-24 00:00:00,6,"Like so many people, I grew up reading Roald Dahl's books and have fond memories of 'The BFG'. It is without doubt one of Dahl's most beloved novels and so it was hardly a surprise when a film adaptation was announced. Fans of the book, however, may not be too impressed with the film. While it stays true to the story and the character are relatively well represented, it feels like the magic of the book has largely been lost.The film does have some positives, especially the vibrant and beautiful animation which is a joy to watch. Although I do think the whole setting of the BFG is so much better when left to the imagination. It's a decent family film and makes for nice easy viewing, but anybody expecting something on a par with the book is in for a disappointment I'm afraid. Put it this way, if this wasn't an adaptation of a classic novel, I doubt it would have received much attention."
" Besides all kinds of colorful dreams, Kirky can also see them.
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,5,"It's interesting to have a third of the middle part in the Giant Cave. It's boring all the time. Besides all kinds of colorful dreams, Kirky can also see them."
" Impossible to adapt this amazing book to film
",2019-01-08 00:00:00,7,"I loved this book as a child. I still fondly remember it and often recall it as one of my favorites. I was excited to see this big-budget Spielberg-helmed film adaptation of one of my favorite childhood experiences. Unfortunately, some things are better left to the imagination.I think this book is just impossible to properly adapt to film. It's not Spielberg's fault that the source material works best in the head of the reader rather than on the big screen. I honestly believe Spielberg did an amazing job with what he was given, but unfortunately some of Roald Dahl's tone was lost in translation to the big screen format.Not sure if this will ever be properly adapted. If Spielberg can't do it, then who can?"
" Not as captivating
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,5,"Roald Dahl's The BFG is brought to CGI life by Steven Spielberg.Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) is a lonely 10 year old girl living in an orphanage. One night she spots outside her window the Big Friendly Giant (Mark Rylance) wandering around the streets of London. He takes her to giant country, his world of giants.The BFG cannot take the risk that Sophie will tell the world about him. However in his world, the BFG is not that much of a giant. He is friendly, he can read, he collects dreams and he is a vegetarian.The others giants are much bigger, crueller and eat humans. The BFG needs to protect Sophie from the other giants who might smell her.Sophie has a plan to forge a nightmare of giants eating British children and give it to Queen Elizabeth II. This would prompt her to send the army to battle these flesh eating giants.The special effects and the performance capture is very good. The story less so. The film is too long, sluggishly paced, I felt bored and once it gets to Buckingham Palace the film lost something when it entered the human world. There was no whimsy."
" Sweet adaptation
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,8,"More than once while watching this film, we commented on the sweet messages and delightful imagery. Mark Rylance is perfect in the role of the BFG."
" It had everything
",2018-12-30 00:00:00,10,"I took my children to see this when it came out and I left saying 'wow, what a film'. It was very funny, great storyline, great scenes, fabulous characters and most of all...it was very magical.Brilliant."
" Excellent family film
",2018-12-30 00:00:00,10,This movie is just brilliant. I loved the book at school and I thought the film wouldn't be as good but I was pleasantly surprised. 😊
" A wonderful movie to fall asleep to
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,5,"The BFG is a wonderful movie to fall asleep to. The animation is beautiful, the music is soothing and the story is slow enough to not overly excite or engage you. Plus, it's a little strange to see a Steven Spielberg film that culminates in one big fart joke. Nevertheless, Mark Rylance does a fantastic job as the title character, and the movie stays pretty faithful to the original story. If you're a fan of the book, you'll probably enjoy seeing it come to life onscreen."
" A very nice family movie!
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,8,This movie is definitely one to watch with your kids and not only. If you are still a young spirit you can watch it with no fear. It will make you happy! No doubt.
" Seriously unbelievably awful!
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,1,"Watched it recently and now I feel the need rant about this awful movie!The CGI is unbelievably laughable and ruins the experience so much!
The script is awfully delivered by every actor!"
" Great and heartwarming
",2018-12-22 00:00:00,10,"I'm not sure why so many people hated this movie or were disinterested in it. I honestly thought it was an amazing movie. It was touching, the soundtrack was nice, and I had no issues with the plot."
" A charming family fantasy!
",2018-12-02 00:00:00,8,"A young orphan girl wakes to see the Big Friendly Giant (Mark Rylance), he sweeps her away back to his world, a world full of fantasy fun, and perils.The BFG was a difficult story to adapt into a movie, but under the leadership of Spielberg, the filmmakers proved how makeable it was.Ryalnce and Barnhill give great, likeable performances, they're supported by an excellent supporting cast.
The special effects are amazing, it's fantasy elements are its biggest strengths.The riskiest thing this movie does, is it uses a few fart jokes, that will definitely turn away some viewers, but it really doesn't detract from the overall film.There are exciting action scenes, fun comedic moments, dazzling and heartwarming scenes.The BFG is an excellent family friendly adventure well worth taking!"
" charming, and i'm my 60s
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,7,"Began to watch this on tv not knowing it was a spielberg movie--after a while, began to think, this is so good, who made it? visually gorgeous and inventive--witty script--sweet and touching--mark rylance is great as always--what's not to like?"
" The big freakin movie
",2018-10-02 00:00:00,8,"Watched the new Steven Spielberg film The BFG. I loved the book, so I wanted to love the film. It perfectly captured the whimsical elements of the book, while still having its own voice. The animation was the best part, a great bit of eye candy went into the film. Solid film Overall 8 out of 10."
" Disappointing...
",2018-09-19 00:00:00,5,"When I found out The BFG was directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Melissa Mathison, I was looking forward to it having a similar feel to one of my favorite films of all time - E.T. the Extra Terrestrial. However, upon viewing this film, I can say that I was sorely disappointed. This film lacks feelings of whimsy and adventure, something you might expect from a film based on a Roald Dahl book or a Spielberg movie. Instead, it feels rather forgettable and uninteresting.I rolled my eyes so hard whenever there was farting on the screen. I mean really... farting corgis. I would have never guessed I would be watching a Spielberg film that contained a dog farting joke. CRINGE...Getting past the farting jokes, something else I was disappointed about and found distracting throughout the film was the special effects. There were many usages of CGI that looked terrible. Some of the shots looked like the visual effects artists didn't do a good job of blending what was computer generated and what was real. Other shots had computer imagery that looked like they were straight from a videogame. I mean honestly, I expected more from Disney, but it seems like many of these CGI-heavy films still look unnatural. That's not to say there weren't any good-looking shots in the entire film. There are a few moments, such as the scene where Sophie and BFG enter the dream realm, that looked nice.Despite all of that, there are some good things about this film. Mark Rylance's performance is probably the most obvious one. His motion capture performance is playful and fun. Many of the different faces and expressions Mark makes in the film genuinely made me smile. The same can be said for Mark's vocal performance, which was a perfect match for the big friendly giant. Another aspect that stood out to me was some of the small details in the film. The set design in particular had many clever details that really elevated the scenes and made the locations feel more like a fairy-tale. With that being said, I still would not recommend this one. Despite my love for Spielberg, I thought this was one of his worst films, and completely worth skipping."
" Wonderfull whimsy
",2018-09-18 00:00:00,7,"Wonderfull whimsy! Great mix of live action and CGI. Can't lose with an imaginative book from Ronald Dahl. Acting was great, and they would not be able to find a kinder face for the BFG than Mark Rylance. I give this film a 7 (delightful) out of 10. {Fantastic Adventure}"
" Family favorite
",2018-09-08 00:00:00,9,This film is beautiful from start to finish a family favorite in English and in Swedish it's great .
" A deft touch for a sensitive story.
",2018-09-04 00:00:00,8,"This is a fine film, with great SFX and great acting / voice acting. I'm not sure what viewers expect, especially if they have read the book. It's a tricky story to bring to live action (albeit heavily CGI lead). I think they've done this story justice. All our family really like this film, young and old. Watch with confidence that this film has sensitivity and soul."
" Impressive, but not captivating.
",2018-06-08 00:00:00,5,"The film was beautifully crystal clear and colorful. The giant world was incredibly well shot and realistic. The visuals were simply incredible, especially once they entered Dream world, which featured some of the most spectacular images I've seen on screen. The production design and cinematography were awesome!I did find the little girl way too confident considering her circumstances and that was unfortunately not very believable, although her ultimate friendship with the BFG was sweet and rather special. The entire feel of the movie plummeted to a bit of silliness once they went to see the Queen, and it felt it was aimed at a young demographic. It had turned funny (in a non-humorist way) instead of fun. Despite this, I couldn't help but marvel at the visuals. In the giant world, I also found the giants to be too kiddie-ish. I understand Spielberg wanted to make a family film, but it lacked credibility. While adults will find they visuals amazing, the story itself might not be captivating enough for a mature audience."
" One line and a superlative
",2018-06-07 00:00:00,7,Was happily surprised about how wonderful this film was. It's idyllic optimism is barely weighed down by the quick resolution.
" Superb
",2018-05-23 00:00:00,10,"Insomniac orphan Sophie sees something she shouldn't in the small hours, and finds herself whisked away to Giant Country in the company of an oddly-spoken giant who collects and dispenses dreams. But he is the smallest giant, and the others are bullies with a taste for human beans... After a cel-animated British TV version in 1989 (where the Big Friendly Giant was voiced by David Jason), Spielberg directs a big-budget cinema take on Roald Dahl's novel. And it is terrific. Dahl is a wonderful author for children (his adult work is less well-known, but also excellent) because, as well as having great stories, he never talks down to his audience, and never sugar-coats things. The BFG is fun despite, and perhaps also because of, its dark areas. The mix of CGI and real-life is done so well that you can never see the join. Real-life Ruby Barnhill as Sophie plays much of the film, which is largely a two-hander, with Mark Rylance's CGI BFG, and it is to their joint credit that the relationship between them is so genuine and affecting - despite their being on set together, the greenscreen and artificiality must have made it difficult to bond.The look of the fantasy throughout the film is flawless, and effortlessly pulls you in. The other giants are genuinely threatening, but just cartoonish enough to be funny, which takes the edge off the menace. Dahl's source material, augmented here and there, is clearly visible in the late Melissa Mathison's screenplay, especially the BFG's unique, hilarious and gloriumptious take on language. The story is simple but fun.For me, despite the eye-dazzling look of the movie (don't bother with the 3D, by the way, a distinct disappointment after Tintin), the chief joy here was the relationship between the two main characters. Ruby Barnhill is excellent as Sophie, but Rylance as the BFG is simply sublime, the touching subtlety of his performance crystal clear through performance capture applied to a character map based closely on his face. After a long and successful theatrical career, his screen work (big and small screens) over the last couple of years has been breath-taking and here, fittingly, it is magical.This film will be an all-time classic. In case it's not clear, I loved it."
" A minor Spielberg movie
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,6,"I saw BFG and was disappointed again. It was artistically well made, but the pacing was slow and it wasn't about much. By the end of the movie nothing seems accomplished. It just seemed to be about this girl with no parents who's taken from an orphanage by the main character and create dreams or nightmares from blue and red potions. There are other giants there that are more nasty, but there's no goal in the movie. Nothing accomplished with no focus."
" Dull as !

" Wonderful
",2018-04-25 00:00:00,8,"This fantasy film, obviously created by people with wonderful imaginations, was a joy to behold. There is so much fine detail contained within, that I found myself constantly wanting to hit the pause button. The characters were amazing, especially the giants, and although I found the film slowed a bit during BFG's reveal, my happiness was reinforced with laughing out loud moments, well, at least one really good laughing out loud moment. The special effects are top notch and the possibility that dreams come from the northern lights just appealed to this long term resident of the NWT. Overall, my time with The BFG was nothing but a positive investment. Well, well done."
" An Imaginative Children's Story Made More Magical with Spielberg's Seasoned Direction of Special Effects and Rylance's Highly Impeccable Voice Work
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,8,"Adapted from the work of Roald Dahl, a famous writer of other beloved children's books such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, and The Witches, ""The BFG"" is centered around a little girl, who is an orphan, and an unusually gentle giant she comes to befriend through their journey to Giant Country. The story is endearing and imaginative as what you would expect from a Roald Dahl movie adaptation but what really makes it work in the cinematic form is the competent direction and the terrific delivery of the titular role. At the helm is Steven Spielberg collaborating with the late screenwriter,Melissa Mathison, whom he had worked with in E.T. Extraterrestrial. Spielberg, who has directed acclaimed films like Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jaws, Close Encounters with the Third Kind, and The Adventures of Tintin which are known for their special effects, continues to prove his mastery of wielding this technical aspect for a greater drive on story telling.  Mark Rylance (who won an Academy Award for his supporting part in Spielberg's Bridge of Spies) lends an excellent voice work (and facial likeness) for the BFG which captures the gentleness of the character as well as his eccentricities especially his way with words.Given the strong aspects of the movie, this may not be the cup of tea for many mature audiences as the story itself is set in a fantastical world as seen through a child's eyes. Still, I predict that the regard for The BFG will grow over the years (like in the case of Spielberg's Hook) mostly due to the young viewers who are more capable of being moved by the moral of the story and of appreciating the movie's memorable sequences that no one seems to notice as of the moment .The BFG is a solid, great movie for children. For adults, you can enjoy it too, like I did."

" Adorable Movie

" Wishing for a second one!
",2018-01-16 00:00:00,10,I loved this movie! The plot and cast are wonderful. I think a second BGF where Sophie is adopted by the queen or Mary and shows the Bfg helping around the castle. Also helping to solve something that only a person not only big in heart but big in size can help with. Please tell me a second movie is in the works.
" Visually magnificent, but hardly magical
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,6,"Visually, this movie is magnificent. But it lacks magic. Dahl's stories had magic. Spielberg's classics had magic. But this film? They seemed to think that a classic tale with amazing effects and good vocal talent would somehow equal something beautiful. Unfortunately, the math does not work out...the end result is LESS than the sum of its parts. I would have better served to read the book (or watch E.T., for that matter)."
" A weak offering from a usually great director
",2017-12-02 00:00:00,5,"The live-action adaptation of The BFG sees Steven Spielberg return to making family films, a special-effects heavy film that is geared towards younger children despite it undertones involving cannibalism.Sophie (Ruth Barnhill) is an orphan in London who ends up being taken by a giant (Mark Rylance) after seeing him at 3 in the morning. In the land of giants Sophie discovers that the giant known as the Big Friendly Giant captures dreams so he can give them to people in the UK and is bullied by the other giants. With the giants posing a threat to the children of Britain Sophie and the BFG goes to the Queen of England (Penelope Wilton) to warn her.The BFG is a slapstick-heavy film, having nut-shots, smiley vegetables and show pleasure with green gassy farts. It's a film where even the Queen farts. It is a kid-friendly comedy especially for children who enjoy that try of humour but there isn't so much for adults.Spielberg does add a level of whimsy and wonder particularly when The BFG enter into a world where he captures dreams and then gives a family happy dreams. This is done through the colours and John Williams' score and there is a great amount of detail like in the BFG's home. Some great moments are when the camera follows Sophie around a location when she is avoiding being seen by the other giants. Yet some of the CGI for the giants falls into the uncanny valley territory.The BFG has a great cast and Barnhill is a revelation as Sophie, being forceful when needed and performed well considering she would have been working mostly with a green screen. Rylance worked well with Spielberg in Bridge of Spies and he offers a gentleness as the BFG. Jermaine Clement was unrecognisable as the leader of the giants and Wilton is perfectly regal as The Queen. The film even has Rebecca Hall as the Queen's assistant and has connection with Sophie.The BFG is a film that children will easily enjoy but as their get older will not look back at it as fondly."
" Good sorry but terribly slow movie
",2017-11-23 00:00:00,4,"I was excited to see this film as I am a fan of Roald Dahl and his kids' stories. The pacing of the movie was so slow that it made me wonder how a child could enjoy this movie if I was having trouble paying attention to it. The scenery and locations are gorgeous, but I felt like it was more of an artwork that actually telling the story. The last half of the film was much better as things started to unwind and become more interesting, but by that point, I was waiting for it to be over. I was highly disappointed in this movie. It's a beautiful story and beautifully shot, but it wasn't a movie that keeps you hooked the whole time."
" BEST SLEEP MY GRANNY EVER HAD don't watch😭😭
",2017-10-28 00:00:00,1,"Hands down the absolute worst film I ever watched. Went to the theater with my 89 year old great grandma, about 2 minutes in after the trailers finished she fell asleep and didn't open her eyes until the cinema lights came back on. Honestly, she was the lucky one, my great grandma didn't have to experience the torture.The acting was so bad I wanted to cry at various points, the storyline was terrible and the characters had to force their words out of their mouths. Actors were bad, whoever produced it was bad, who ever directed it was pretty bad too. But don't ask my grandma because she had a wonderful hour and a half sleep. If only I could have too.Don't WATCH😤😴😥😰😱😖😡"
" The BFG
",2017-10-18 00:00:00,10,"I recently saw the BFG by Steven Spielberg it is a fantasy and adventure film which was produced by Kennedye and Marsall in 2016 and lasted 1h 57min. This movie is set in American it tells the story of BFG played by Mark Rylance the story begins An orphan little girl befriends a benevolent giant who takes her to Giant Country, where they attempt to stop the man-eating giants that are invading the human world. I personally think it's phenomenal. I wold recommend it because the script is bright."
" A pleasure for the eye and the soul
",2017-09-29 00:00:00,8,"A beautiful tale brought to life by Spielberg. A fascinating universe makes up for the simplicity of the story (which can be forgiven since it's a children's book). Dahl's original story is beautifully retold on screen. The jokes and good ending most certainly make it an amazing, enjoyable family movie that is a pleasure for both the eye and the soul."
" SFX (rental)
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,7,"So for me, it's Spielberg more enjoyable movie since Indy IV as it's shorter and more concise than his 140 historical movies. For sure, the pairing with Hook is inevitable (british fantasy) but i felt more to be in the Potterverse. The 2 lead actors, the BFG and the orphan girl are really impressive and one more time, Spielberg shows that he has a special gift with childhood. I found the London by night and Queen palace really beautiful and the dreams hill totally fantastic. The way Spielberg moves this giant BFG and grasps a whole dynamic moment is truly a signature from a master (it's not the head-achy bombing of frames done by most directors today !) However i don't know if it's still a movie : for me, a movie means reality and that's on it that comes emotion. Here i really wonder what's left untouched by computers ? Were the sets the usual green emptiness ? So it's more like an animation (a bit like his so-so Tintin) and that's why at the end, Hook is still better because nothing can't beat the real thing !"
" Steven Spielberg has done it again!
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,8,"The BFG review Steven Spielberg has done it again! A story about bullying and social acceptance that was wonderful as a book, even better as an animated cartoon but the film is a glorious spectacle of acting, scenery, effects but most of all an underlying message which will be enjoyed by young and old, especially the scene where the queen is having breakfast with the BFG and Sophie (watch the Corgies!

" A great family movie
",2017-08-08 00:00:00,9,"A great movie with a surprising and fun story, great acting from the two leads. The Movie looks great, and the soundtrack is amazing.The soundtrack in combination with the scenes invoke a sense of wonder and innocence at times,the friendly giant is almost immediately a very likable character as also Sophie played by Ruby Barnhill. The performances by Ruby Barnhill and Mark Rylance are memorable, and fun.Steven Spielberg made a wonderful and memorable movie, that i will certainly remember for a very long time."
" a kids movie for sure
",2017-07-16 00:00:00,9,"i stalled watching this movie with my 6 year old, because of it's rating. now i regret it, she loved it. it was a colorful world, and definitely made for kids (boring for adults, i admit). I believe Steven Spielberg has the ability to see the world from a kid's eyes. the special effects were also brilliant."
" Wonderful and mesmerizing, in every aspect artistry.
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,10,"It is much easier (for some people like myself) to expound on criticism than write a positive review enumerating the incredible aspects of a film. I found this so beautifully well-done on all levels that I find words hard to expand this brief synopsis. The IMDb requirements for posting do not allow anything shorter than 5 lines for submission, and so I have done my best to simply say, so much fun watching this film, engrossing and fun. Someone wrote a review claiming that Spielberg's monochrome black and white accounts of historical moral lessons in his previous films are, to put it plainly, a bore. I can't say that every Spielberg film is my favorite, but of the films that are in black and white genre, absolutely fascinating and not trite or boring or trivial or poorly done. He's one of the film masters of our era and I hope the audiences can see the charm so cleverly dispersed and intertwined with cinematic genius. Yeah Spielberg."
" Not completely magical, but sweet and very entertaining
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,7,"The bar has been set so high for Spielberg movies that anything less than Oscar-level quality is often seen as a failure. However, to judge the BFG along those lines would be a great disservice to a movie that has a great many merits, particularly as a family film. Shed of much of the darkness of Roald Dahl's source material, Spielberg breathes a healthy dose of his magic into The BFG, though it never reaches to the greatness of ET. Spielberg, however, does get some very strong performances from Mark Rylance as the title character and newcomer Ruby Barnhill as the young orphan who befriends the giant. The real star of the movie is probably the spot-on motion capture that brings the giants to life. If you're expecting a groundbreaking film like Raiders of the Lost Ark or a crisply directed work like Catch Me If You Can, you're in the wrong movie. But if you have room for close to two hours (which might be a tad overlong) of sweet, touching fun, you should absolutely consider The BFG."
" Belly warming!
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,10,"Oh my what a beautiful feel good movie, this was by far the best novel to screen re- enactment I have seen. The book was a huge favourite of mine as a child, my class teacher read it to us when I was 10 years old and I never forgot it, watching the film brought it all back for me, I was really moved. Thank you SS!!"
" Not that bad
",2017-06-12 00:00:00,5,"So when I saw the reviews I went in with low hopes but the only problem with this story was the ending. This ending was a bad one for 3 reasons 1.the bfg and Sophie don't stay together 2.the the bfg doesn't know how to write, so how is he writing everything down, he may have been taught how to write a little but this ending made no sense 3.the ending where she wakes up in the castle, NOTHING is stated that she was adopted or how she was kept with them,Overall the movie was okay but the ending might need a rewrite."
" Giant Yawn
",2017-06-02 00:00:00,5,"(Flash Review)The movie is rather plot less and more of an adventure with a kind giant and stereotypical yet non-charming British girl. The message of its OK to be different is sort of obscured within the story for a movie that felt to be aimed at 13 year olds. The Giant steals this girl out of an unfriendly orphanage which never ended up being a problem point for the story. Hard to describe this movie, which is a bad thing. Basically, the two become good friends as other bigger giants pester them both. The friendly giant is a dreamcatcher and can give anyone good or bad dreams. So he plants some dreams within the British royalty to help hatch a plan to get rid of the bad giants. I dunno.unique and arguably poor graphics with a few poster-quality images but it needed a better plot or writing or more intrigue. The pacing was off or some scenes should have been trimmed. Failed to meet my expectations."
" Great imagination
",2017-05-29 00:00:00,7,"Little orphan girl Sophie secluded at an orphanage in London decides to be awake at 3 am to watch what happens at the hour when the boogeyman and the witches use to show up. A giant comes through the window and kidnaps her and takes her to the Giants' country where he is just one small giant being harassed and humiliated by the other giants much bigger than him. While he is gentle the others are mean, wicked and man-eaters. Between him and Sophie a very friendly relationship develops itself and she soon reveals herself much smarter than him and starts to conceive and put in practice a plan to fight and get rid of the evil giants. That's from there that story goes on in surprising scenes till the final outcome. The performance of Ruby Barnhill as Sophie is excellent indeed. Besides that we can also refer the appalling sceneries at the Giant's country and the extremely well made impersonation of the giant evil monsters. A story of great imagination to be followed with pleasure."

The acting Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) was fantastic in her role, she played the character of little girl in a perfect way, BFG (Mark Rylance) voice and emotional face also were good not to forget his comedy lines, also the same goes for Jemaine Clement who did very evil voice. The design of the motion picture also was good, colors, castle trees, and dreams. The story was a little bit long."
" Please shoot the people who invented CGI!
",2017-05-03 00:00:00,2,"Please shoot the people who invented CGI! 3 May 2017 One star each for the farting dogs!What the bloody hell did I just watch? Well, I'll tell you...Two hours of randomly assembled scenes of shiny inanity suffused with terrific computer generated artistry. But the artistry was wasted as every other aspect of the film failed to match it.An extremely annoying child with a horrible northern (English) accent meets a puny, self-loathing giant elf. They become chums and decide to ask the Queen of England for help in their quest to stop the really big giants eating all the children. The helicopters swoop in and save the day!At first, I thought this was simply another instance of the arrogance of Hollywood inflicting their sadistic will on humanity. But the more I think about it, the more I think that, actually, Hollywood is deliberately churning out this disgraceful bilge-water so kids will start reading books again! There's no other explanation that I can think of as to how this travesty of celluloid ever got past the 'ideas on the back of a napkin' stage!Even the rubbish TV cartoon version made in 1989 outwits this crap-fest on every level - apart from the aforementioned visual effects!The movie is very slow... not helped by the extremely simple story. The plot seems to have been padded out with lengthy scenes of shiny, bright lights just to meet the minimum required running time that a movie has to have. All the humor is misguided, misplaced and unfunny... ALL of it... although I did enjoy the two farting dogs!Not one of the characters has any appeal... apart from the brilliant farting dogs! You just want to punch the stupid girl in the face and shoot the miserable giant elf in the temple... The entire Buckingham House scene should have been cut out. It was just embarrassing to sit through.Oh, and if your kids do see this - you'd better tell them that if they jump out of tall buildings there won't be anyone there to catch them! Yeah... incredibly, this actually happened!Is Spielberg working like a food critic these days? You know... someone eats at the restaurant, writes the review and the big name foodie gets the credit? I can't believe the same person who directed 'Jaws' had a hand in this clunker!"
" Brace Yourself For The Next Step
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,10,"I loved this movie. A beautiful & classic Fairy Tale perfectly presented. Times change & the fart jokes will just have to be tolerated. Technically it's a marvel. A true photo realistic & live action blend. The Giants are a near perfect melting of live action & CGI. The technical wizardry did NOT overpower the entertainment; perhaps the greatest wizardry of all. Sources say Spielberg knocked himself out in pioneering this great leap forward. A true master craftsman. I reviewed Tin-Tin years ago & at that time I thought this level of integration would be many more years in coming. Technology moves faster & faster. The final thought I have is one of foreboding. Soon; very, very soon, all the great stars of the past are going to return from the dead. Film is a dog eat dog business with no room for common decency. Pandora's Box has really been opened. What will you do when The Duke, Tragic Marylin, Bogart, Elizabeth Taylor, The Stooges & any other film legends who are dear to you come back as some sort of Zombies. How about Debbie Reynolds & Carrie Fisher? Will you go watch Virtual Marylin's new film? Recoil in disgust or horror? They WILL NOT be allowed to rest in peace. It is not Spielberg's fault it is only progress. BRACE YOURSELF.If you want a sad illustration find the 'Audrey Hepburn' Commercial on U-Tube. ""Audrey Hepburn Resurrected in New TV Commercial - Creepy or Cool?"" This is actually old by several years & 'Audrey' looks a bit mannequin-like. IT IS ALREADY HAPPENING. Especially sad to see dear little Audrey brought back from the dead. She was a Anti-Nazi resistance fighter, Nearly starved to death, a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. Truly a remarkable human being. Told you so.Things are really beginning to heat up. James Dean will soon appear as ""Zombie James Dean"" in the upcoming Vietnam Era action film, 'Finding Jack.' It will be a minor role. Sides are being taken in the breaking controversy. It will be interesting to see how well it is executed. Only the beginning."
" Under-appreciated
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,8,"This film, being by Raoul Dahl, is a very British story and Spielberg really captures that well. Special effects are beautiful, the BFG is expressive and engaging, and Sophie expresses angry orphan quite well. Overall, this is a great film. It is not a direct take on the book, but most people seemed to prefer that with Lord of the Rings, so why not here as well. It never needed to be overdone to be charming.Being a fan of John Williams, I appreciate his very magical music. It doesn't have to be Harry Potter to be magical. . . and pretty."
" Too much is shown clearly. Too limited for imagination. There is no ""mistery boxes"" at all...
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,4,"When you read a fairy tale - you dream and imagine yourself. In a movie, a lot of ready things are shown. In ""BFG"" (2016), almost all is shown and designed very well. I got no place to imagine something myself, everything was already shown and told to me. The story contains major plot points in a right place but visually during the whole story, we can see only one-two locations which are shown to us in a limited way, so there are no mystery boxes I found at all! It is more is like a theatrical performance created as the digitally animated movie and it feels like this are the computer generated graphics because sometimes there is no story - there is only VFX, concept arts, and VFX again. The story contains only a few heroes and they are designed as studio decided, so many of them wasn't in my visual taste and there is untold background story about the ""bad Giants"". There is an untold story about the background of ""Giant Country"", about the BFG himself who he was before, who gave him this job, which living beings higher than BFG also exists in his world. His world are too empty with living beings! Also, the story contains not so many questions which creators tried to raise or things to tell to the audience. It feels no more than just an another screen adaptation of another book of the fairy tale. Creators and studio hadn't done a large homework doing this movie.P.S. Excuse me. This is my first film REVIEW written in English and published online."
" Beautiful!
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,10,"What a beautiful story! Everything about this movie is top-notch! The story is a heart-warming tale of an unlikely friendship between a little orphaned girl and a small elderly giant who is bullied by all his fellow giants. Both main characters win the hearts of viewers from the first few scenes. This movie is two hours of delightful adventures that gives rise to laughter, tears and hope. I did not want it to end, and it now ranks as one of my all-time favorite movies."
" Better than expected Dahl adaptation, courtesy of Spielberg
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,6,"THE BFG is the second adaptation of the Roald Dahl children's book, following the 1989 animated version that featured the voice of David Jason. This one's a big-bucks Hollywood attempt at the tale, directed by none other than Steven Spielberg. After he made such a mess of his aimless and interminable TINTIN adaptation I wasn't expecting much, although I'm pleased to report that THE BFG is a rather pleasant surprise.This film is no masterpiece but it is quite watchable and it does seem to remain true to the book throughout; Spielberg's penchant for random CGI action scenes is limited to only one particular moment (the car skating scene). Otherwise, this has a pleasant, HARRY POTTER-style atmosphere, and it utilises some great CGI work to bring the BFG to life. I'm no big fan of Mark Rylance, but his voice is rather good here and fits the character very well. Ruby Barnhill is less assured as the slightly annoying child lead, but Penelope Wilton is great choice to play the queen late on in the story. THE BFG is rather overlong but at least it's never boring, and even the low brow humour works quite effectively."
" Great Movie
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,9,"""Bigger Than Life"" Movie Review of The BFG.The BFG, or Big Friendly Giant, is a heart-warming family film that explores the idea of finding friendships in the most unusual circumstances. The balance of action, magical intrigue, and humor will keep adults and children alike glued to the movie screen. The story follows a young orphan girl, Sophie (played by Ruby Barnhill), who mistakenly observes a giant snooping around the streets of London from her bedroom window in the middle of the night. This giant, The BFG (played by Mark Rylance), snatches her from her bed and takes her with him to giant country to ensure that the knowledge of his existence remains a secret. Terrified at first, Sophie begins to learn about the BFG's life, as well as the existence of other, much less friendly, man- eating giants. Together, Sophie and The BFG plot out a plan to rid the world of these horrible giants, while developing a friendship that both parties are desperately in need of. The screenplay stayed true to the story line of the original novel, and captured the comic nature of The BFG's backward speech. Spielberg's ability to create a bigger than life on screen giant is impeccably done.I do caution; the PG rating may be somewhat misleading, as younger viewers may find some of the giants to be a bit imposing, to downright terrifying. Overall 4 Stars; must see! The movie is derived from the 1982 novel by Roald Dahl. This 2016 movie production was directed by Steven Spielberg in conjunction with Melissa Mathison, who also worked with him on E.T."
" Pretty good adaption of Roald Dahl's classic
",2017-04-04 00:00:00,7,"This is a pretty good adaption of Roald Dahl's novel. Steven Spielberg did a fine job of directing this. The little girl who played Sophie in it was also pretty good at it. One thing I didn't expect though in this film were these so called wizzpoppers. In the novel when the BFG drinks the frobscottle, he gets this tingly feeling inside of him and then jumps up and down giggling and so does Sophie when she drinks it. Then this is when I realized that when I watched the documentary about this film is that a wizzpopper is also a fart. lol. Although I did not expect the wizzpopper to be a fart. I expected it to be something else. Oh well it's pretty funny, but also a bit crude. Also the guy who played the BFG did a good job too. Also another thing I didn't expect in this film was that the BFG had another human friend before Sophie and that was sadly eaten by the man eating giants or was he? Also the man eating giants were sent to this island with all snozzcumbers instead of being put into a big hole like in the book. Also the dreams in the book are invisible except the trogglehumpers aka bad dreams. The dream scenes in this were pretty good too. I also like the ending to this too and the BFG was writing about his adventure with Sophie and that was also part of the book. The visual effects in this are pretty stunning and the music by legendary John Williams was very good too. This film is a very good adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel and is cherished by quite a few."
" Such a shame....
",2017-03-30 00:00:00,4,"This is a total miss, I grew up on Roald Dahl, this film doesn't have any of the magic or story telling that should come naturally with one of his books.The continuous music removes any atmosphere, and I assume this is the opposite of what was intended! The casting is awful, Ruby Barnhill as Sophie is terrible (in fact, annoying) and the voice actors for some of giant's just don't work.Such a shame."
" ""Dreams is actually very mysterious things.""
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,8,"I'm surprised at the low score and quite a few negative comments about the movie from the reviewers at IMDb. Personally, I go for the whimsical, so stories like ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Big Fish"" hold a kind of fascination for me, whether it be the written word or in a picture like this. The inventive language used is quite clever, odd enough to sound weird, but close enough to the English words that are represented to make it sound credible from the mouth of a twenty four foot giant. One of the surprises in the story (since I haven't read the source book), had to do with the fact that 'Runt', the BFG, was actually small by comparison to the other denizens of the Giant Country.Watching the movie with my eight year old granddaughter, I've never seen her laugh so hard or so long as when the three canine pets of The Queen (Penelope Wilton) did their double take upon drinking the frobscottle, sending them into a tizzy of whizzpoppers. It made me stop and reflect on a common element seen in almost every kids movie these days, a reference to passing gas that seems like a prerequisite of the script. Most of the time it feels like a juvenile attempt at a cheap joke, but here it was actually comical to see and I had a good chuckle myself.For my part, I got the biggest kick out of The Queen calling Nancy and Ronnie to inform them of the latest turn of events. So it made sense when I looked up some information on the actual novel, written in 1982, just a couple of years into the Reagan administration. I thought that was a clever tribute to the President and his wife in the picture. I'll have to check out the Roald Dahl book to see if it's mentioned there.The one drawback to the movie to my mind has to do with the unfortunate choice of title. When trailers for the film first came out I couldn't help but wince at the unintended connotation the name suggests. I don't have a particularly dirty mind, but it's hard to miss. I only mentioned it once to somebody and they immediately knew what I was talking about. So I think if they used ""The Big Friendly Giant"" as the title of the movie, it would have worked a whole lot better.Well, be that as it may, I had some fun with this picture, watching it a second time to pick up once again on the nuance of Runt's colloquialisms, stuff like 'bozzwinkles' and 'phizzwizard', all of which adds a charm and colorful character to the story. The young actress Ruby Barnhill seemed just right for the part of Sophie, developing a warm and special relationship with her new giant friend. When she states at one point ""It's just all rather hard to believe"", it becomes an invitation to the viewer to continue on a magical journey made special for the kid in all of us."
" Charming Flop...""Old School"" Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum Fantasy...An Anomaly Today
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,7,"Children's Stories about ""Giants"" or a ""Giant"", is an Anachronistic Nightmare. The World has become so Scary and Technologically Sophisticated that there are other ""Monsters"" Afoot that Invade the Sub-Conscious of the Little Ones.So this is a Tale of Old, or Today might be Called ""Old School"". That may be Why it Infamously Flopped ""Big"" Time at the Box-Office. Disney and Director Spielberg did turn a Profit with its Worldwide Distribution.The Book from Roald Dahl is said to be more Edgy and Frightening then this Squeaky Clean Adaptation from the Prolific and Popular FFD (Family Friendly Director/Disney).Acknowledging that Fact and moving on, this is a Seamlessly Effective Special Effects Fantasy that can certainly Entertain if one Adapts to the Premise. The Film, while Charming, well Acted, and Word-Play Witty is Lacking an Urgency that Moderns are Accustomed. The Third Act Falls Flat and Fails to End this Noble Nod to Dated Delights of the Past.Mark Rylance as the Titular Character has Received Accolades and Ruby Barnhill as the Little Girl do have a Chemistry and Their Bonding is Believable. The Film has a Beautiful Bounty and the Dream Catching Scenes Stand Out along with the Delightfully Detailed BFG Cave.Overall, the Movie is a Minor Spielberg Effort, as it Stands Today, and an Anomaly that Attempted to Go Against the Grain of Modern Modes of Expectations."
" An annoying book gets the full Hollywood treatment
",2017-03-08 00:00:00,6,"Those who have read the Roald Dahl book - particularly those who have had to read it out loud to young 'uns - remember how annoying it is. With its mispronunciations (human beans), nonsense words (swollomp), preoccupation with flatulence and weird plot elements (but WHERE IS Giant Country?) it 195 pages can seem much, much longer. Getting back to Giant Country for a moment, the book takes place in 1983 and presumably, giants have been freely moving between realms for hundreds of years. Only now Queen Victoria thinks to send in the helicopters to end the reign of terror? It doesn't even take that many of them to do it. Anyway, Spielberg's direction holds firm to Dahl's vision bringing his giants to life in a way that seems to conform exactly to how every child pictured them. Except for the uncanny valley problem. Spielberg's digital renderings are near enough to human to make the giants appear like dead-eyed automatons innervated for the amusement of popcorn-munching audiences and waiting for the sweet, sweet release of oblivion after their Spielbergian master tires of them. The scenes between Sophie and the Queen come as some relief. In short, a fully realized adaptation of the source material and all that entails. But if you have to read the book anyway, may as well see the film version."
" Be feeling great
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,7,"The big friendly Giant by Steven Spielberg. What can go wrong right? Well apparently, if you believe in Box Office numbers a lot. Also the movie does have a section, that kind of puts the movie into a full stop. And while that ""dinner"" scene is kind of funny, it really stops everything. It feels like a set piece, conceived for laughs and to pander to the little ones.You be the judge if that worked. Because apart from that, the fantasy aspect of the movie is really good and it works. There is the kid who discovers a whole new world with someone who can be his friend. Although as you can imagine it's not that easy. It never is and the boy may feel a bit annoying at certain points. But he's also charming and the movie wouldn't have worked without him"
" Magical first half, but doesn't quite sustain itself
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,8,"Recently I realized I hadn't see a Steven Spielberg movie for awhile, so I came to IMDb to see what he's been up to. There I saw something called The BFG, which I'd never even heard of - the first time I've ever not even heard of a Spielberg film.Turns out this was his biggest flop in North America - yes, this movie did worse than the execrable Always - and that's a shame, because it spite of its flaws, this is a lovely, magical film.The movie follows the adventures of Sophie, an spunky orphan living in a version of London seemingly unstuck in time and reality, who is kidnapped by a genial giant.The giant is wonderful. Computer animated via motion capture and as brilliantly played by Mark Rylance as his Oscar-winning performance as a Russian agent in Bridge of Spies, the giant is funny, charming, and incredibly real.The animation of the giant is lovely from the first scene of him sneaking his way across London, loping along then quickly and amusingly fading into the shadows. The interplay between feisty Sophie and befuddled BFG is engaging and real. Dream catching is wonderfully magic.Then, around halfway through, the movie goes back to London and something goes wrong.It's not that the movie becomes awful so much as it just becomes ordinary. If the first half of the movie has the magic of something like Cuaron's A Little Princess, the second half feels like some Disney movie from the '60s. In part, I'll admit that this is my reaction to the unlikely premise, but it's a kid movie and it's all unlikely so I can live with that. But somehow it all feels pedestrian from that point on.I don't know why this movie did so poorly. While it could have been better, I think my kid-self would have really liked this movie, and I wouldn't be surprised if this movie builds a reputation over time. If only the second half matched the first."
" not Spielberg's best
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,6,"Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) is a 10 year old English orphan. At the witching hour, Sophie spots the Big Friendly Giant (Mark Rylance) who takes her to the Giant world to avoid her alerting the public of their presence. The BFG is actually a vegetarian and the runt of the group. The other giants are bigger, bullies the BFG, and eat human beings. The BFG collects dreams and Sophie comes up with an idea to warn The Queen by manufacturing a nightmare about the human-eating giants.The Giant world is intriguing both visually and in substance. There may be some holes but it still works. Little Sophie has the required cuteness mixed with a pluckiness. Rylance is great. The adventure could be a lot more adventurous. There is turn before the third act which takes the magic of the story and plants it squarely into the modern world at a specific time. There is one fun joke but mostly, the story loses its magic. There is a way for the movie to fully satisfy its dark fable core but it seems to lose that thread. The movie is still fine but it's missing a truly heartfelt drama. The major difficulty is any comparison to Spielberg's earlier classics. The feeling is different and this will not be one of his celebrated best."
" Well intended, good looking but highly uninvolving movie
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,5,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The BFG"" (2016) is probably the most weak film of the great Steven Spielberg I've ever seen. It is great looking movie, but only because of a very good special effects. Acting by Mark Rylance was also pretty good and... that is basically all the best i can say about ""The BFG"". Story which is based on a book I've never read and and will never do is OK - i do believe that story whatever it is can be done into a good / great film - it is not about story, it is about everything else and the most important - script. In case of ""The BFG"" script isn't good. At all. I kinda lost my interest in this movie since like after first ~20 min. There wasn't anything really interesting, and ye, by saying nothing interesting when you see giants... Directing wasn't good as well i think because movie dragged like hell - it finished it in like ~3,4 days. Acting by Ruby Barnhill was more annoying then anything resembling to a natural performance. And i know i do sound like a hater here but trust me - this is one of the rare cases when you see all money spent on special effects, but there isn't anything good to see.Overall, ""The BFG"" is a huge disappointment for me. When i first heard about this movie by Spielberg with the great Mark Rylance i kinda expected it to be a fantastic experience. After seeing it, it kinda hurts that this became Spielberg worst."
" P!ss off
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,6,"Steven Spielberg makes a children's film based on a story by Roald Dahl featuring a magic giant: shouldn't this be great?Spielberg has grown to become a legend in cinema with massive cultural and critical hits such as Jaws, Indiana Jones, E.T., Jurassic Park, need I go on? I mean he made Schindler's List. What happened?The movie is about Sophie who is abducted by a dream-creating friendly giant. The start was good, it was light, charming, funny, you really like the characters of Sophie and the BFG but that was not the problem, and there is a problem. The acting was really fine, Rylance was good as the giant and Barnhill was very likable. Once again the half of the movie I enjoyed and was very optimistic but then it kind of all went down the s*hole.I mean when you have a great cast, a great director who still can make incredible cinema why this?? The scene in Dreamland, with the tree and the dreams was really good, really magical. But it's like he gave up halfway there. The story suddenly doesn't make any sense. They go find the queen to help them (or something, I don't care) and then you get the most despicable scene I have seen in a long time, in the queen's palace. It was just foul. Cheap humour like that is so beneath the potential that this film had, let alone Spielberg. How can a man like him, a visionary, make something that honestly made me think of Garfield 2. Just so very disappointing. The ending did not make any sense, it was so painfully stupid.The CGI is partly very beautiful, partly creepy and ugly to look at.In the end it's really not a terrible movie or anything, it had some really strong scenes and performances but no. If you pull s*** like this p!ss off. He gave up halfway on a movie with great potential. Is the same year that Shyamalan made a strong comeback, this Spielberg was disappointing.6"
" A fairy tale, nothing too fancy
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,8,"A little orphan girl befriends a mysterious giant that lives in Giant Country. There is little else in this two hour movie. The villains are just big bullies and the story itself is simplistic. Just revel in the amazingly kind facial expressions of Mark Rylance and the wide-eyed girlish charm of Ruby Barnhill and you will enjoy the film.I've seen there are many disappointed people, people that watched the movie expecting a return to form for Spielberg or imagining some rehash of the classic tearjerker story of a child befriending some scary but misunderstood monster. This is neither, as the story is based on a children's book by Roald Dahl dedicated to his daughter that died at the age of 7. Paradoxically, it's all about the dreams of little girls of living a full life and very little sadness."
" Not an enjoyable watch.
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,3,"So, me and my partner needed a film to watch and we settled on the BFG. Within the first 5 minutes we both agreed that the film was being ruined by the character of Sophie. Wooden acting and an annoying and overly pretentious voice. This continued throughout the film and proceeded to annoy us further. The fact the BFG had an uncanny resemblance to Ryan Stiles was on my mind the entire film. The movie has a massive play on British people. It over stereotypes Britain as a pompous country. The Queen also is horribly stereotyped with her butlers and Corgi's. I have a feeling this was done to appeal to an American audience. However, my biggest gripe is the time jumps in the film. So it all starts off in what appears modern day Britain as you see a modern double decker bus going past Westminster. However as the movie plays through the opening scenes with Sophie we see frequent clues to it being around 1940-1950. Moving through the film, we see Mr Tibbs use a walkie talkie from around the 1970's-1980's, also the military uniforms used are of 1990's on wards as are the majority of military aircraft. I know that's an odd thing to pick up on, but it was so annoying for someone like myself. Bad acting, over stereotyped for an American audience, loads of inaccuracies, and the ending was a bit naff. Would not recommend."
" Not a total failure, but a rambling, timid effort to bring a difficult book to the screen
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,5,"It's been a whopping 25 years since Steve Spielberg's last real children's film, when he disappointed children and adults alike with his Peter Pan re-imagining Hook. After a long period of going back and forth between monochromatic, Oscar-wary history lessons and crowd-pleasing blockbuster fare, Hollywood's most famous director is back trying to win the hearts of both children and parents as he did with one of his most celebrated movies, E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982), with a passion project he's been considering for some time. He also reunites with E.T. screenwriter Melissa Mathison (who sadly died last year) to bring the notoriously tricky world of Roald Dahl to the big screen.Insomniac orphan Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) spends her nights either beneath her blanket pouring over books or roaming the halls of the orphanage looking for anything that may spark her interest. While up late one night, she shushes some drunks staggering home from the pub, only to glimpse the shadow of what looks like a giant hooded man. The figure gets closer and closer, until a giant hand reaches in through her window and whisks her and blanket both across the country. The mysterious monstrosity turns out to be a giant indeed, but a big, friendly one, played in motion capture by a wonderful Mark Rylance. The BFG is the runt of his litter in Giant Country, and is routinely bullied by the much bigger fellow giants that lurk on the land outside of his cave. The two outcasts will form a bond that will see their two worlds unite.Brian Cosgrove's beloved animated film from 1989 was incredibly close to the book, and was said to be a personal favourite of Dahl's. Yet a faithful page-to-screen adaptation of a terrific piece of literature doesn't necessarily result in a good movie, and having watched the cartoon relatively recently, I didn't find it very entertaining. Spielberg's update also stays quite close to Dahl's text, and it suffers from the same saggy narrative as the much shorter movie that came before did. Anyone hoping to keep their children entertained for a couple of hours may find them getting restless, as Spielberg is happy to take his time exploring this strange land. It's a decision I applaud, but it doesn't excuse an incredibly slow middle-section, as the BFG introduces the world of dream-catching, snozzcumbers and the joys of farting to the precocious Sophie, complete with rambling monologues and existential pondering.There's also a noticeable reluctance to explore the darker areas of the book, with the giants (played like Cockney bouncers by the likes of Jemaine Clement and Bill Hader) failing to live up their names (Fleslumpeater, Bloodbottler, Bonecruncher). They instead come across as bullying buffoons and not the child-munching monsters they are meant to be. If there is one thing the film gets totally right, it is with the casting of Rylance, fresh off his Oscar win for Bridge of Spies (2015). The wonderful effects by Weta perfectly capture the warmth and innocence of his performance, and his line delivery is pitch- perfect. Spielberg also goes all-out with Dahl's bizarre finale, which sees Sophie recruit the Queen herself (Penelope Wilton) and her trusted butler Mr. Tibbs (Rafe Spall) in her fight against the evil giants of Giant Country. It's a truly weird climax, but it's the only consistently funny part of the movie. Not a total failure by any stretch of the imagination, but a somewhat rambling, timid effort to bring a difficult book to the screen."
" Those people who say they loved the book but not the film have rose-tinted specs!
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,8,"I think it is worth pointing out 2 things:1) Too many people are saying they loved the book but not the film. I can only assume it has been a very long time since they last read it. Perhaps over time they have remembered it differently. Having read the book again immediately before seeing the film I can assure you it is almost entirely faithful to the original text (barring a couple of new scenes).2) If you HAVEN'T read the book then at the very least you should do your research before watching the film. I read a review from some fool who complained that they were annoyed by the giant getting his words all wrong! I guess they just don't get it and missed the point entirely. Perhaps they would have looked beyond that if they had read the book first.All in all, I personally think that though it is not perfect, it is still incredibly faithful to the quaint magic and mystery of the book, with a few beautiful cinematic moments thrown in. And for me there is one truly perfect aspect - Mark Rylance has the most incredibly warm and friendly eyes. Sounds a small thing, but without it, his CGI character just would not have worked."
" Boring
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,1,"One of the worst movies in this genre. The child star was supposed to be cute but she was grating and wooden, she was at times really annoying to watch and it was hard for me to watch the movie. This is the only Spielberg movie where i walked out of the theater than endure more than 30mins of the movie.The movie just starts all of a sudden with a very pompous girl who has insomnia but looks perfect. Her acting was was a pain to watch and i am surprised that she made the cut ahead of so many other kids who would have made the movie a treat to watch. For some reason the graphics and CGI were too bright to enjoy and the camera movement sometimes gave me a whiplash."
" 'The BFG' is so sweet.
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,7,"I'm just thankful that Steven Spielberg is not doing awful period pieces like his last films, including 'Lincoln', 'War Horse', and 'Bridge of Spies'. Yes, those films won Oscars, but I'm willing to bet you've only seen the once and will never see them again. I'm thankful and excited that Spielberg has returned, at least for a few films into his magical world of sci-fi, which he excels at. This time around, Spielberg is tackling the children's story of 'The BFG' or 'Big Friendly Giant', by the great author Roald Dahl ('Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', 'Matilda', 'James and the Giant Peach', and 'The Witches').There are quite a few similarities to Spielberg's opus 'E.T.', in which a creature befriends a small kid and they go on adventures and connect with one another. Even the late Melissa Mathison, who wrote 'E.T.', wrote the screenplay to 'The BFG'. If you're looking for some of those 80's Spielberg moments, then you'll definitely find them here. That being said, iI don't think it all holds as much weight or charm as his early films did. In fact, I think this film plays more to the younger crowd than it does to the adults.Sure, there are things for everyone, but I imagine that farting corgis will only go so far for laughs. If you're unfamiliar with the story, 'The BFG' follows a young orphan girl named Sophie (the brilliant Ruby Barnhill), who is quick on her feet and a food natured soul. There are talks about giants who eat humans in town, and one night, a giant grabs little Sophie. Fortunately for her, this giant (Mark Rylance) is a friendly giant who catches dreams and nightmares from a dream tree and delivers the good ones to humans while they sleep.Sophie and the BFG form a friendship with his hilarious and charming dialect and language, and she teaches him some proper etiquette. Just outside his house, away from the real world, lives a group of mean old giants, who look more like barbarians, and who eat humans and especially little kids. Jermaine Clement from 'Flight of the Conchords' and Bill Hader provide some of the voices for the mean giants here and are quite funny. This world that Spielberg has created is magnificent. The vast views of the sea and green pastures, as well as the BFG's home is so much fun and full of little fun details, that it would take multiple viewings to catch everything. Everything just seems so magical about it.Soon enough, Sophie and The BFG go to the actual Queen of England and enlist her help to take care of the bad giants. The scene where the BFG is in the Queen's castle is truly funny and will be a big hit with the kids. Ruby Barnhill is amazing as Sophie and just emulates a strong presence and confidence in her role at all times. She is charming and fun to watch on screen. I hope she sticks around for a while, because she has good acting chops.Mark Rylance as the BFG is excellent as well, and even though it is all on motion capture, his voice work and movements are simply amazing and life-like. I just don't think there is enough emotional weight or charm that would make this film one of Spielberg's best. Still, this is a great movie and one that I would certainly watch again. And of course, when you get Spielberg, you get composer John Williams, who again, brings another great and memorable score.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
" Good for kids, so-so for anyone else
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,6,"I was dragged to see this movie last summer with my girlfriend because she thought it looked like a cute time-passer. I can't say I had high hopes, as I have never read the book and the film looked like nothing more than a high-budget Netflix movie, although I did have some excitement that Steven Spielberg was directing it and the CGI looked beautiful from the previews. After I walked out of the theater and recycled my 3D glasses, I was thinking to myself, ""that wasn't too bad for a family movie, but did I really HAVE to see that?"". There were positives- the visuals were spectacular, the musical score by John Williams was amazing as usual, and the performances were top-notch, but the problems were that I didn't find the movie rich in story or humor. It feels like a rip-off of E.T. only with juvenile kids movie humor, which made sense, due to the film having been directed by Spielberg and produced by Amblin Entertainment(hence the E.T. and Elliot bicycle moon logo at the intro), and it wasn't as heartfelt as the for-mentioned film, either. The attempts at comedy are amiable and suitably childish for the kind of movie this is, but at the theater I was in, I didn't hear much laughing out of any of the families that were watching the film. All in all, BFG will be enjoyed by the younger children, and anyone else won't hate themselves while watching it, but they'll still most likely be either checking their watches or playing games on their phone. However, my girlfriend enjoyed it immensely, so what can you do?"
" the worst fantasy/family movie in a long time
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,4,"having watched a hefty number of 'family' flicks, from blockbusters to some of more independent productions, the BFG comes as the biggest disappointment of them all.as it turns out, the director's name doesn't add any value to the piece. first of all the characters aren't really likable. the 'monster' is awkward and not funny at all, and the little girl comes as very annoying. the story behind the film is portrayed like someone had a deadline breathing down his neck, the 'humour' is forced and in numerous moments you'll just find yourself facepalming in disbelief - something that shouldn't happen in a good family movie.from the start the story doesn't really engage you, and it won't till the end. the farting jokes (yes..) are probably the pinnacle of bad cinematography applied in the BFG (although 6 year olds will love them), with the final part involving the Queen following closely.it's a really bad one, doesn't bring you much positive emotions (the dream hunting scenes are so 'meh' and look like a rip-off of a rip-off) or decent laughter either. actually the biggest surprise came at the end, as I saw Spielberg's name listed as the director... the only moment I sincerely laughed.someone said it's sort of like 'Song of the sea' - well it's exactly on the opposite end of the scale. there are plenty cheap family flicks that are more bearable than this 140 million dollar (!!!) production.do yourself a favor and skip this one."
" Amazing Family Film!
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,8,"Going into the film I had no idea what to expect except for a Big Friendly Giant. This film completely felt like Spielberg and it was a heart warming film with a little of an unbelievable ending. Sophie played by Ruby Barnhill is a great young actress and her relationship with the BFG played by Mark Rylance made the whole film. At first, the BFG kidnaps Sophie to protect his existence from being revealed but later on Sophie sees good in the Giant and learns that he is the runt of the group of giants. The film deals with dreams the good ones and the bad ones and all in between have a different color. It reminds me of Inside Out. The BFG collects dreams and has the ability to create dreams. Sophie being a tiny human teaches the giant to stand up for himself and to trust more. which leads us to the ending. Sophie and the BFG team up and get help from the Queen and together they get rid of the mean giants. Overall, the film touched upon many human themes and is a well made beautiful film. If you haven't seen it I encourage you to do so. 8.4/10."
