" Gladiator ripoff but didn't have the balls to do anything great
",2021-03-30 00:00:00,5,"I mean, it was a movie, didn't love it didn't hate it. But it was clearly trying to steal things from other good movies but halfheartedly and without passion or depth.A) Gladiator - obviously a rip off, from the gladiators overcoming overwhelming odds, to the emperor/senator being defied moment, etc but just not very well doneb) Rogue one ending, I mean, come on, for such a lame love story, at least let them go off in peace and have a happy ending! I didn't feel like I was really invested enough in the characters to feel any loss at the end - especially when it seemed like they could have gotten away! The horse was doing great! A meteor just landed in front of it!C) Assassins creed possibly with the insane ninja like skills hurling swords and axes into people from 10 yards away, spinny double sword combos, I mean, come on! You were a horse warrior and the other guy was a gladiator, not Jet Li meets The Prince of Persia!!All in all, 5/10, I mean it's not like ghostrider or something - a true 1/10 and it's not an 8/10 like some critics think it is! As if it's 1 or 2 stars away from academy award winning productions lol! Although I guess oscars have been given to some questionable movies, especially in recent years..."
" Don't rush to judge - it's not great, but it is still quite entertaining...
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,6,"It's maybe apocryphal but there is a story of tourists visiting Windsor Castle and reportedly asking why they would build it under the Heathrow flightpath? Well this is a similar sort of affair - why would you build a town on the escapement of an active volcano? Well not only did they, but ambitious prospector ""Severus"" (Jared Harris) has aspirations to expand the town and so he and scheming wife ""Aurelia"" (Carrie-Anne Moss) try to worm their way into the good books of the visiting Senator ""Corvus"" (Kiefer Sutherland) who takes a bit of a shine to their young, independently minded daughter ""Cassia"" (Emily Browning) who has, herself, taken a bit of a shine to the bit of rough that is ""Milo"" (Kit Harrington). ""Milo"" is a slave destined to be a gladiator. He is skilful and shrewd, quickly befriends top dog prisoner ""Atticus"" (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and the scene is now set... Can he stay alive, save the girl from the clutches of the evil senator and escape the impeding volcano eruption? Well, what do you think? It's not the worst CGI-fest that you will ever watch, and the performances are adequate given the limited skills of the writers with some decent (3D) disaster effects towards the end that carry it along OK. Don't expect top notch drama, it's essentially a vehicle for Harrington to flex his pecs and for Sutherland to ham up his role as the Senator with loads of colourful pyrotechnics and absolutely no jeopardy whatsoever... Fun, though."
" Nice
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,6,"The film has excellent moments and, at the same time, not very well thought out situations. The action scenes in the movie are really good. There is a lot of emotion and the visual effects are spectacular. In several scenes of destruction, it is possible to remember the second half of Titanic, where you know that many will die, but you still hope that everyone will be saved. But ... on the other hand, the key scenes in the film that lead the story leave much to be desired. The argument is not necessarily a bad one, but many of the dialogues are weak and forced. The scene in which the romantic couple sees each other for the first time is of a canastiness that not even Mexican soap operas present. And, in addition, there is a lack of charisma and chemistry between the romantic couple of the plot, making the film fail to have the emotion expected among certain characters. Even so, the final balance is positive and it is a film that will probably appeal to fans of history and action films.Film seen on the 19th to the 20th of March 2021."
" 10 to balance the 1s
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,10,"Not everything is a 0 or a 10 you morons. having a 6,7,or 8 movie is fine. Too many spoilt brats expecting gladiator or spartacus everytime they go to the cinema.... its a fun mostly accurate movie with kiefer sutherland for gods sake. its a 7/10 at best but you miserable wannabes give it a 1? Ill give it a 10 to boost the score."
" Better than ratings suggest
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,7,It's a good action paced movie which was well acted. Just a solid watchable movie. Kept me engaged and interested in the characters which is all you can ask for.
" Extremely Underrated phenomenal film!! Its not gladiator its Pompeii!! Loved it!!!
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,10,"1st off it isnt gladiator nor is it trying to be!! Its a disaster movie with an excellent story thrown in. I compare it to the masterpiece titanic. Not as good as that but very very close!! If it was 3 hrs it might be right there with it. Loved the plot, the special effects were spot on not overdone but enough to give it that tension and fear that a disaster creates. The love story wasn't forced and was believable they had chemistry and what an awesome ending!!! The 3d was exceptional and it's in my top 25 3d movies of all time. It actually benefited my purchase of the bluray because of the moronic low 5.5 rating ( really?????????l) I literally stole this gem for 14.95 brand new delivered!! Its so funny how movie goers have become such followers they hear tenet is a great movie and everyone follows suit even though that movie stunk!! Its at least 3 stars below this movie!!! Pompeii should easily be a mid to high 7 or 8. To the cast and crew BRAVO!!! Job extremely well done, also kiefer made a GREAT villian!!! Whole cast from lead to extras ALL were excellent not 1 was mediocre or average!! Rewatch this movie open your eyes and see it's an Underrated gem!!!!"
" Another annoying film of ancient times told with modern culture & fads
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,3,"Unfortunately , movies like this are so focused on the fads of today, that it is hard not to get cynical with the way the stories are told. The need to include minorities & empower them in ways that are currently in, give a disreality to how things were in that time. It would be good to see storytellers researching the times in which they are portraying & try to show men & women of different classes & cultures in the ways that they really would have related back then, Instead we end up with these weird ways of interacting that are PC driven & just plain bizarre.
Since the major tsunamis of 2003 & 2011, everyone is aware of them & of course there was a huge explosion & tsunami when Pompeii went crazy at that time. But what gets up my nose is the way it all has to be bigger & huger than imaginable. We see this mountain of water heading for the island & yet somehow something does not add up when the heroes are able to outrun it & seek safety behind a big wall. But hold on a second. The wall of water coming to the island was like a mountain! And now that fairly high wall is containing that mountain of water? Something does not add up.
The infusion of todays morals & viewpoints seem to get suffused into these shows when in fact the ways people thought would have been products of their times. Instead of seeing PC supporters of human rights why not show how people probably actually were. They were adapted to the times in which they lived. They considered slavery as normal & very few probably questioned it, yet the heroes are always these virtuous sorts who probably did not even exist! More infusing todays morality into another time, thus creating a fake view of history. Stop the sanitising.
And finally, those accents! What is it with US managed world productions that whenever they want to depict ancient Rome, they seem to go for British actors including ones with cockney accents!! Lol!"
" Entertaining but not good
",2020-09-03 00:00:00,6,"It a fun movie to watch if you like the story of Pompei or you just watch it for Kit Harington. The movie is fun but not really good. There are some parts of the movie that seem like the concept was just copied from another movie. Like the relationship between Cassie and Milo. A slave who fights in an arena and falls in love with the boss's wife. Sounds familiar? Think about Gladiator (2000).
The acting is also not great. Some just say their lines and that's it.
Altogether, the film is entertaining but nothing more.
6/10 for Pompe√Ø"
" Entertaining
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,5,An entertaining movie. It's a disaster movie but with a real plot outside of the actual disaster. Too predictable though.Some times I was a bit confused while watching POMPE II. Maybe because I have never seen POMPE I.
" It delivers exactly what it should.
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,9,"What is a movie supposed to do? What is it for? The main reason movies are created is for entertainment. This movie does not fail to entertain, unless you are expecting, quite simply, too much. It's a straight up kick ass action packed CGI extravaganza. It's something to switch off too and simply enjoy the show, with eye candy thrown in for both sexes. So it does exactly what it should.It is definitely NOT a documentary. It is definitely not a recapping of historical events. It is also not a film that will exercise the brain or shock you with a dozen unique twists at the end, so if that's what you require, look elsewhere."
" ALMOST UNWATCHABLE
",2020-08-07 00:00:00,2,"This is just specious history tied to politically correct anachronisms. It seems that well-done historical films had a very short run. They were laughable during Hollywood's so-called golden age, and then we had one brief, shining era-epitomized by the Merchant Ivory films--and now, multicultural over-sensitivity coupled with lack of research has brought us to the current (probably irreversibly) degenerate phase."
" Fantastic
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,10,"Doesn't deserve the bad ratings/comments.Lots of action, and sense of impending disaster with Volcano. Mixed with romance.And I'd say this is a mans man movie with a leading man and ending - no Rogue One Star Wars here he's a proper bloke"
" It's all in your expectations....
",2020-07-09 00:00:00,8,"I read the other reviews, and agree with the few who understood that this was just a fictional story set in a real time, a contrived action movie set in an actual historic major disaster. I wasn't in the mood for anything deep or life-changing. I just wanted to take a break and watch an action film, and I got that. I wanted to like the main characters and to see the bad guys get their comuppance, and I got that. I wanted cool special effects, and I got them in spades!
I had a fun afternoon and enjoyed every single minute of this movie."
" Casting
",2020-06-18 00:00:00,6,Most of the casting choices make sense but who the hell thought Kiefer Sutherland would make a good Roman senator?? I've liked him in other roles he's had but not this one.
" Another ho hum sword and sandal 'epic'
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,6,"As a student of Roman history I have a soft spot for these movies. But they are so rarely any good. Sadly. The main problem is that most are romantic twaddle. Heaven knows there is much compelling factual story material from the great Roman Empire, if treated seriously. 'Gladiator' was 'OK' - certainly entertaining.The TV series 'Rome' parts 1 and 2 were excellent. The story of the end of the Republic and the beginning of the Principate (aka Imperium) is compelling. What is going begging is a series on the last 100 years from 376 to the unravelling of the Western Empire in 476, THE most compelling period in European history which ripped the continent permanently apart, setting the stage for the following 1600 years of bloody tragedy: up til the present. Arguably the greatest tragedy to befall humam civilisation, snuffing out learning for another 1 000 years; ironically restarted with the fleeing westward of the survivors, with their knowledge, on the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire (incorrectly labeled since the 18th century by lazy historians, as the Byzantine empire .... an empire that never existed. On the collapse of the Ottoman empire in 1919, the formal title of the Ottoman Emperor was still 'Emperor of all the Romans')."
" Needed more disaster and less swordplay
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,5,"Kit Harrington is a Pompeii slave turned gladiator racing to save his true love as Mount Vesuvius prepares to erupt in AD 79. As the lava starts to flow he must escape the arena and rescue his love from the evil general before they are both turned to ash.This needed more of Pompeii destructing -as a disaster movie cause I enjoyed that part and less gladiators fighting cause that was bad- sure tons of swordplay but very tame with little bloodshed or graphic violence considering the ""fight to the death"" theme. Was this a Disney movie?The plot is predictable, nothing we haven't seen before in many better movies. Kiefer Sutherland as the bad guy is laughable, while trying to give the intensity of Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator he becomes a caricature. I did like the ending ""just look at me"" surprise, everybody dies. Oh and Kit Harrington looked good."
" Good popcorn flick, but don't expect Gladiator quality
",2020-05-30 00:00:00,6,"This has always been a film that if I'm bored I'll just grab off the shelve and give it a watch, if you're looking for historical accuracy an amazing plot or even world-class fight scenes you won't find it here. What you will find it a fun, action-packed easy to follow and most importantly fun film.Kit Harrington, Emily Browning and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje are all good actors but in this they're a bit of a let down and only average really, the fight scenes are really fun to watch but seem a bit artificial somehow. I've seen a lot of people bashing Kiefer Sutherland in this but personally I actually found him to be a pretty darn good villain, Sasha Roiz on the other hand is a pretty unconvincing ""finest gladiator of Rome"", but he had some good fights.The plot is the usual, complete with corny romance but at least it's not as bad as Twilight. CGI wise here it's pretty solid but not ground breaking.6/10: Definitely a really fun film, has some genuinely inventive scenes but not to the scale of Gladiator. Basically a B movie Gladiator."
" A middling movie.
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,5,The actors and effects are alright; the plot is contrived and terribly predictable.For a film with a fair amount of swordplay there is surprisingly little blood. I'm not sure that really adds or takes anything away.Don't expect too much and you'll probably find this quite a passable affair.
" Gladiator this is not
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,3,Either as a tribute or imitation- it even took a lot of the phrases from gladiator -which just made it even harder to watch nothing different or redeeming in this movie
" Pompeii
",2020-03-04 00:00:00,4,"Let's start with the positive: the movie looks great, the visuals and effects really work. Little else does, though. The cast acts wooden, the story is predictable and boring, borrowing many elements from Gladiator and the end is cheesy as hell. Overall a real waste of time."
" Should've been a great movie
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,4,"They got great actors for this film but their talent was wasted with a very thinly written storyline. You literally have the perfect recipe for what should've been an epic movie... great actors, check. Historical tragedy background, check. Budget, check. Special effects, check. But someone dropped the ball. The love story is rushed and forced. You don't attach to any of the characters really. It could've been the next titanic but no."
" Visual effects try to make it up for the lack of decent narration
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,3,"Classic example of Hollywood movie in which the massive use of special effects tries to cover the mediocrity of the narrative. The storyline is shallow, unrealistic, full of already heard lines and dynamics. The only element of surprise in the narrative might be the ending, which is instead the part where an already seen and predictable happy ending would have been the best choice to give a meaning to the overall story.
The soundtrack is beautiful, but not much space is given to it."
" Plenty of pomp in Pompeii.
",2019-11-24 00:00:00,8,"Enjoyable romp and romance, great cgi, with plenty of action. If you are looking for historical accuracy, then it's probably best you turn over to the History channel."
" Underrated
",2019-11-22 00:00:00,7,"While not a classic, Pompeii is actually a pretty enjoyable disaster/action flick that I couldn't wait to see back in 2014. I remember enjoying it in cinemas and have just watch it again for the 2nd time. I really need to get around to watching the 24 minutes of cut footage as I feel several characters were highly underused, especially Carrie Ann Moss and Jessica Lucas. While the ending still kinda annoys me, I really don't think it could've ended any other way.It's fast paced, has some great action scenes and is an overall pretty decent. Nowhere near as bad as others are making out to be. I wish Emily Browning would make more big budget movies."
" Good CGI/acting - terrible script/storyline
",2019-07-07 00:00:00,4,"Kit Harrington is a brilliant actor, but unable to draw the desired emotions from the audience due to the lack of brilliance in his script.
I found myself yelling ""run you idiots"" and laughing, rather than feeling emotional for two lovers facing peril.
I love a good love story, however the lack of verbal communication between them and general knowledge of one another, left it difficult for me to believe or feel emotionally invested in their story.
Visually the film is a success. All the action sequences and cgi looks great and would surly please anyone who is looking for a good action movie. (Maybe just fast-forward the storytelling scenes)"
" The highlight of this movie...
",2019-07-05 00:00:00,4,"Were the four people with golden masks naratting the fights in the arena. I could watch an entire movie with them.As for historical accuracy, there is no trace of it. Pompeii is portrayed as a town that denounces Rome's values, supremacy, and culture. In truth, Pompeii along with other former allies of Rome fought 160 years earlier in the Social Wars (91 - 88 BC) exactly for being granted Roman citizenship and after receiving that they quickly adopted the Roman culture and even latinized their names.As for the rest, the entire depiction of the Roman army, senators, and cruelty, all I can say it was lame."
" my notes
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,7,Had some questionable parts but had enough awesomeness to cancel it out. loved all the parts with the volcano and the gladiators. perfect ending and a good love story with good action and awesome scenes (2 viewings)
" Terrible movie
",2019-06-21 00:00:00,2,"This was an awful movie. The casting was terrible. Kiefer Sutherland normally reliably great in everything was terribly miscast. Kit Harrington did his best but I have seen him in a few things now outside of GoT and each character has been similar to that of Jon Snow. This was no different. The CGI was ok but it was just so boring and predictable. The love story was ridiculous. Finally the script was appalling. At times they seemed to blatantly replicate lines and scenes from Gladiator. A prime example is one scene where they reimagine a famous battle in gladiatorial combat and when the outcome is different Kiefers dodgy Roman general says he cannot recall it ending that way, yes just like Phoenix did in Gladiator. I really have nothing good to say about this movie really. Really hope Harrington gets his A Game going soon as I really do feel he has potential. Swerve this one."
" It's a disaster movie.
",2019-06-12 00:00:00,7,"I don't get all of the reviewers acting like they were expecting some sort of cinematic masterpiece from a disaster movie.
Yes, it's cheesy and the characters aren't all that well developed, but, for what it is, the acting is solid. There is a plot, even if it is not original or perfectly accurate. The special effects are really well done. I was perfectly entertained. If you went into watching this movie thinking you were going to get anything more than what they give you, it's your own fault.
If you're bored and need to kill an hour and a half, you could do worse than watching this. Sure it's sorta bad, but bad like a disaster movie is supposed to be. I enjoy decent cheese from time to time."
" Got what I came to see
",2019-06-02 00:00:00,10,"I watched this movie for these reasons:1. Kit Harington's abs
2. Epic volcano
3. Watching slaves fight backI got what I came for and expected nothing else"
" I wouldn't watch this again for free pizza
",2019-05-18 00:00:00,1,"What a load of rancid dingo kidneys
Is the fact that Kit Harrington cannot bloody act some kind of collective blindness"
" A masterpiece
",2019-05-14 00:00:00,8,"After watching Season 8 of the Game of Thrones, you'll realize this ain't so bad. No longer the worst on Kit Harington's resume."
" As Bad as Most Other Recent Films
",2019-05-13 00:00:00,1,Not moved in the slightest and I cry at the drop of a hat lately. Script was inane and Sutherland's worst performance ever. How much did they have to pay Kit Harington to star in this disaster disaster?
" Great clich√©
",2019-05-12 00:00:00,7,"It's not original. The plot was shallow, rushed and copied from everywhere. And despite this, the actors did an outstanding job with their characters (Cassia, her parents, Milo, Atticus) and miraculously brought humanity and believability into the very shallow scripts they were handed. I wish they had tried to hit less tropes, and just done those few tropes really well. With that said, the sword fights were exceptional; all of the gladiator scenes were excellent. The tension buildups and complete destruction from the volcano was excellent too.Spoiler alert: I know its fashionable to kill your protags these days. But after all that cheese, I think the appropriate ending would have been to escape and watch the aftermath from afar. That kissing ash sculpture bit was disappointing.I did however like the movie."
" a film made 50 years too late
",2019-05-09 00:00:00,5,"I saw 'Pompeii' in the wrong place and at the wrong time. Movies that heavily advertise their 3D effects must be seen in cinemas equipped with this projection technology. I skipped the movie at its time in cinemas, and I just saw it now at home, in reasonable conditions, but not in 3D, so I lost the thrill caused by the lava waves and fire boulders threatening my body integrity. The story of the film is of course a disaster that is famous from the history books, while the story that was crafted on it is kind of typical for the historical mega-productions at the mid-20th century, plus some melodrama a la 'Titanic'. Too late and too conventional for the second decade of the 21st century. Yet, the catastrophe remains on the screen, the film itself is not a disaster, rather like at the limit of acceptable entertainment.Almost everything that's happening in this movie prepares the special effects of the last 30 minutes. The story is a kind of simpler 'Gladiator' that includes a love story between a Celt slave (played by Kit Harington) and a noble Roman girl (played by Emily Browning) that has just as much chances of being consumed as the people of Pompeii had to escape the disaster. Film director Paul W.S. Anderson fails to infuse too much life into this pretext-story, and focuses on rendering on screen bloody gladiator fights and the special effects of the volcano. These are really well-directed, the realism of the men's confrontations in the arena and outside it being basically the only, let us say, modern features of the film.The actors' performances are acceptable. Besides the two actors in the main roles, the cast also includes Kiefer Sutherland, an actor I like to watch in any movie or TV series where he appears. The special effects are of good quality. Viewers looking for art movies have nothing to find in this film. Spectators who are looking for acceptable entertainment and who properly calibrate their expectations are likely to have a good time watching this movie."
" Romance, tragedy, muscle bound gladiators...Epic!
",2019-03-09 00:00:00,8,"Looking for pure escapism? There's nothing like an epic extravaganza with a story that hooks. It's gorgeous, great special effects, costumes & set design and a cast of familiar faces overacting up a storm. Romance, tragedy, muscle bound gladiators with gleaming muscles, the obligatory chariot chase scene, the whole ball of wax.I know I know, it's not historically accurate & it's nothing new, don't care. Didn't make it any less entertaining.Familiar faces
Kit Harington - brooding handsome Jon Snow from ""Game of Thrones""
Jared Harris - Lane Pryce , accountant from ""Mad Men""
Kiefer Sutherland - currently starring in ""Designated Survivor""
Carrie-Anne Moss - terrific supporting role as Jeri Hogarth in Marvel Series ""Jessica Jones""."
" A combined Pompeii / Titanic review (to save space)
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,2,"Cassia/Rose yearns for authenticity and rescue from an empty life of unearned privilege. Yet little does she know that the very ship she is sailing on is about to hit a volcano. Her stuck up parents know nothing of love so when happy-go-lucky drifter and gladiator Milo/Jack steps into her life the cataclysm du jour will be the musical score to their passionate rebellion against stultifying normativity. Milo/Jack might be resentful of his third class dungeon but his Irish/Celtic charm finds him ready allies in other minorities despised by the English/Roman autocrats. Milo/Jack proves he is the right man for Cassia/Rose by showing her the beauty of steerage/a field in the moonlight. After climaxing in the best sex ever, the couple can no longer ignore the signs that their parent's stupid world is listing/out-gassing. If they want nooky again they must escape and they call on their new found allies who will die to help them get out (literally). Milo/Jack and Cassia/Rose float away on a door/flaming horse and live happily ever after. Or close enough."
" CHEESE LAYERED WITH CHEESE ......!!!!
",2019-01-31 00:00:00,4,Wow what a cheesy film but sort of worth a watch 4.5/10 . I have seen much worse and will never watch it again but ok if you turn your brain off .....!!!!!!
" ""Disaster Film"" Indeed
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,2,"Wow. Seriously, just an all-around bad film. I stumbled on it while home sick with the flu. 104 minutes of my life I'm never getting back.It's poorly acted and the characters leave you indifferent. Kiefer Sutherland's momentary lapses into Jack Bauer are just awkward.The only redeeming quality of the film? EVERYONE DIES!!!!!"
" Anemic clich√©ed story which can't be saved by a late injection of hot magma
",2019-01-16 00:00:00,4,"Too much boring scenes of less-than believable romance, magical negroes (in the worst tradition of Holywood - really making the only black charaster say ""spirits of the mountain"" , really Holywood?) and swashbucking (or in this case - leathercracking) heroics. The scenario and acting is weak even by the peplum standards of the 60ies.Not enough historicism or substance."
" Great Fun!
",2018-12-16 00:00:00,7,"Keifer Sutherland playing the ""horrid roman"", with a plomb! Harrington being the slave with a knack of winning in the arena assisted by a very tall and gifted dark skinned chap, who for me walks away with the acting honours in this film. Most enjoyable romp"
" Pompei (2014)
",2018-12-06 00:00:00,7,"It's a bigger budget historical film which was solely made of commercial purposes and many claims it to be inaccurate but as a positive does not have the flaws the recent Paul W.S. Anderson films has. I always had to watch his films since he made such good films like AVP : Alien Vs. Predator (2004) and Resident Evil (2002) which was guilty pleasure Game-Film adaptations. But he became more weaker in his new films like ""Death Race"" and ""Resident Evil Franchise"". Though it was the case in his new film "" Pompei "" he tries to do something new by changing the subject matter. And he fails to make something new. Though that is the case his new flick appears to be having at least a better script than his other new films. So it was technically a good move by the filmmaker.Overall - 3/5"
" No Warning No Escape
",2018-12-05 00:00:00,10,I Saw This Movie In Theaters And I Really Enjoyed it The Final Act Is The Best Part Of The Whole Movie If Any One Who Likes Distaer Movies I Recamnd Pompeii
" Pompeii
",2018-11-21 00:00:00,8,"No words I'm really enjoyed.
paul proved he is a best director."
" Like Titanic, we know how this ends
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,5,"The film attempts to develop an interesting love story to the background of Pompeii. Celt (Kit Harington) is taken prisoner by the Romans after they wiped out his village. He grew up fighting in the London arena. He is whisked away to Pompeii years later where his great strength as a gladiator and his ability as a horse whisperer catches the attention of a woman of wealth (Emily Browning). As it just so happens, she is being forced to marry the Senator (Kiefer Sutherland) a man who slaughtered Celt's village. Is there a writer in the house?The love story never evolved. Like most fighters, Celt has no trouble with 12 men, but takes him much longer fighting one man. There are no real political statements in the film. Celt believes his gods are punishing Rome, blah.blah, blah.
No F-bombs, sex, or nudity"
" Laugh out loud bad
",2018-11-15 00:00:00,1,"This was such a disappointment. I loved the Robert Harris book about Pompeii and the Rome TV series. But this a very distant relation of both. It looks okay - a bit clunky at times - and the storyline is passable. But the acting is way beyond dire. It is, as I have eluded to, so bad that it is funny. You could see better performances in adult movies, or so I am led to believe! What a total waste of time and money."
" Problems Galore, and Not Just With a Volcano...
",2018-11-14 00:00:00,3,"Unfortunately, there are so many things wrong with this movie, it ia almost embarassing to point them out.Acting first...remember the old silent movies, where every actor had to exaggerate their movements to understand what they were doing? That is exactly the way you end up feeling here, that it was supposed to be a silent movie and added sound later.Next, the CGI, was this supposed to be a super duper 3D presentation? Unfortunately again, the CGI is presented as more of a young childs painting. The colors are wrong, the depth missing, and if a volcano had blown up like that, the entire boot of Italy would be missing today. In other words, the CGI was thrown in for shock and awe, rather than to highlight the movie...Oh, and did I mention, the acting stinks!"
" Way better than the reviews.
",2018-11-04 00:00:00,7,"Despite being overtly sentimental, 'Pompeii' is an exciting Roman epic, with exhilarating action sequences and with less CGI (in the battle scenes) than Gladiator. Keifer Sutherland, is at his creepy best playing the evil character (Senator Corvus). Without the historical romance, this could have been a much smarter action adventure. Still it's a highly rated and a well acted blockbuster and for me ticks (nearly) all the boxes.Received some terrible reviews but i just can't see why!? One to simply sit back and enjoy."
" historical and factual inaccuracy is an understatement
",2018-10-20 00:00:00,3,"'holllow characters and a predictable story'
. The history of Pompeii and its fate was completely ignored and the idea of a tsunami scene was just to be able to show a ship sailling the streets of Pompei !!the sheer number of volcanic bombs is as impressive as it is false.. ashes yes, and a lot of it, small stones too.. the pyroclastic cloud was nicely done if too fiery..I too was relieved it finally ended. what a piece of useless trash"
" Shameless gladiator knockoff
",2018-09-13 00:00:00,2,I'm guessing they didn't get the memo that this movie was already made.... Only 100 times better than this.
" Fictional story based on fact
",2018-08-12 00:00:00,10,"This adventure movie is based on a real event, the destruction of Pompeii by the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD. It is not meant to be a documentary about the event itself. As an adventure-romance it is excellent. Story, acting, and special effects all work well together to move the story along to the spectacular climax. It is irelevant whether the facts are accurately portrayed anymore than they are in Ben-hur, the Ten Commanments, or any other epic fictional piece. The only way to judge it is does it hold your attention, do you care about the characters, and is it enjoyable to see. In this, Pompeii exceeds the general run of the mill adventure movies and remains one of my favourites, whether or not it is factually correct,."
" Cliche story but cool effects
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,7,"Ok, so the story wasn't great and there were a lot of clich√©'s, but I really liked the way the movie was made: beautiful setting, costumes and cool effects. So overall I really enjoyed this movie!"
" Very bad movie...
",2018-07-17 00:00:00,2,The only good thing about this movie was Ariadne's (Jessica Lucas) bust...
" Pity about the pathetic back story.
",2018-06-17 00:00:00,4,"The producers were probably hoping for a 'Titanic'-like romantic disaster film. Sadly, though, 'Pompeii' suffers from silly dialogue and unconvincing, bland acting. I did not find the whole Gladiator back story interesting. The continuous fighting despite the chaos of the eruption was silly and annoying. And, honestly, how many near-death moments am I supposed to endure in one film? Also, the chemistry between Kit Harrington and Emily Browning didn't feel natural. Kiefer Sutherland's acting was similar to stage acting and carried very little weight.The recreation of the city of Pompeii was amazing, and the film did have some incredible visuals - notably the collapsing villa scene, and off course, the final eruption moments."
" Terrible Plotline... worse acting
",2018-06-17 00:00:00,2,This was actually a movie that I spent money to go see in theatre being as the storyline of The Eruption Of Mount Vesuvius was always very interesting. The script should have followed what was known.. not conjecture. I'd have rather given my 12 Bucks to a homeless guy and that would have been a better story and plot.
" Vulcan's Fury
",2018-06-02 00:00:00,3,"It is Gladiator meets Volcano as Hollywood Hack Paul W S Anderson once again strives to make a passable film and fails.Milo (Kit Harington) is a slave called the Celt from ancient Briton was as a child saw his people massacred by cruel Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland.)Milo is now a gladiator brought to Pompeii as the nearby mountain is about to erupt. Milo is due to battle mighty Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) who needs just one more victory to become free.Milo's horse whispering abilities has also brings him close to a roman woman Cassia (Emily Browning) as she arrives in Pompeii to be with her wealthy family. Hot on her heels is Corvus, who wants to marry Cassia and is the new senator of Pompeii.However as Pompeii spews its volcanic ash, Milo sees his chance to get revenge on Corvus.The film is utter tosh. The first hour is a thin story with zero characterisation. The second hour moves from Gladiator to a Roman disaster story."
" Not bad at all
",2018-05-08 00:00:00,8,"To be fair i would put a 7 for this movie but i really don't understand all the low ratings! And i have watched a lot of crappy movies! Very good visual effects, decent acting, sure it's not the movie of the century but it's enjoyable to watch! An average note of 5.5 isn't fair in my opinion."
" By The Numbers.
",2018-01-19 00:00:00,5,"Most of the reviews capture the main elements of the movie. If it missed a clich√©, I missed the missing of it. Just an example. We know that in slasher movies the supposedly dead villain leaps back to life. The earliest and best example of such an event is from ""Wait Until Dark"" (1967). Here, one of the more dislikable heavies -- Kiefer Sutherland as the pompous representative of Rome -- gets to pull the stunt twice.There are three blacks in the movie. They're all friends and caretakers of the white people. One by one, they are picked off. Usually the white hero and heroine (Kit Harrington and Emily Browning) get away alive, but in this case everyone perishes, with the two lovers turned into upright statues of ash.Those clumsy looking human forms that we've all seen from Pompeii are interesting. None were upright, of course. Pompeii was buried under thirty feet of ash, left alone for some 1,700 years, until in the early 19th century some of the men wielding shovels found that their shoes sometimes broke through the crust into hollows below. Then archaeologists began to locate the holes and fill them with plaster. But that's neither here nor there. Without giving the matter much if any importance, I picked up scenes (or suggestions of scenes) from ""Gladiator,"" ""Spartacus,"" ""Titanic,"" ""The Horse Whisperer"". and one or two others I've forgotten.In return for sitting through the formulaic events, you get in return a massive display of visual effects: flaming meteors, boulders falling from the sky, a giant tsunami, fires, earthquakes, landslides, a monstrous pyroclastic flow, and praising the chocolate cake at one of your own restaurants. It's such a shattering experience it will make you think twice. Twice but not three times.Informative datum. Pompeii had a red light district and the cobblestone street was worn down an inch or so by the heavy wagon traffic, like inverted railroad tracks."
" Pointless film
",2018-01-19 00:00:00,3,"I gave this film 3 stars for the fight scenes only.The script was poor, the acting more so. It was Titanic with flames instead of water.The 'lovers' spent most of the film looking rather pathetically at each other.Other than the volcano the only person I rooted for was Atticus. I couldn't wait for them all to be ashed."
" Really not very good
",2017-10-27 00:00:00,5,"This was basically a spin-off and flawed attempt at ""Gladiator."" The film tries, in vain, to piggyback off the success of Gladiator, while forging a new plot based upon the catastrophe of Pompeii. Unlike Gladiator, the acting and general screen presence of all of the actors, including seasoned ones like Keifer Sutherland and Carrie- Anne Moss, was abysmal. I was really disappointed in Keifer. Normally, his acting is spot-on. In this particular cinematic atrocity, he was really not believable, and his accent was really poorly executed. When every actor's performance in a film sucks, there invariably exists a serious flaw with the casting and script. The characters were not cast as regal or noble, just snotty, sarcastic, and incapable of empathy. The graphics were akin to ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" where the ground surreptitiously collapses in every direction, around a sole character. We get it...he won't escape...blah blah blah. Not recommended."
" A good entertaining story
",2017-10-27 00:00:00,7,"If you are wondering whether you should see this movie or not, I think you should see it. It may be historical inaccurate but who depends on Hollywood to learn history?Making a movie about the ancient city of Pompeii is difficult because everyone already knows what happened. The brute power of Nature (although it didn't exactly happen that way) is greatly portrayed by the technology available in Hollywood today; however, I don't think this is the movie's biggest asset.What I enjoyed the most is that the sword fighting sequences weren't overdeveloped by a martial arts expert and they are realistic. The love story develops in a natural way (who never knew someone interesting in the most unusual of places?!) and the end may indeed surprise some, while making completely sense."
" So bad it is almost comical (but not quite)
",2017-10-06 00:00:00,1,"Sometimes is fun to watch a movie on TV just to trade jokes with your friends. Pompeii is one of those movies, so bad it is almost comical (but not quite).The plot is the following: the barbarian hero - weirdly named Milo - witnesses his tribe been slaughtered by evil Romans, under the command of super-evil Jack Bauer, in Roman rags. Milo ends up as a gladiator in Londinium and from there he's moved to Pompeii, because he's just too good a fighter to rot in the province. Along the road he helps Cassia, a damsel in distress and it's love at first sight. Once in Pompeii Milo is incarcerated with a politically correct tough guy (sort of Jules from Pulp Fiction, only with a lot more muscles). Under the flimsiest pretense, Milo and Tough Guy are taken to Cassia's villa, where Milo has another chance at intimate conversation with the girl and also discovers that Jack Bauer plans to marry her (obviously against her will).The following day, the sh*t hits the fan: during the games in the arena Milo and Tough Guy are targeted for destruction by all the other gladiators, but the Vesuvius decides to start erupting there and then. All the main characters try to escape one way or the other. In the best Titanic tradition, unconcerned by tsunami, earthquakes and flying balls of fire, Milo, Jack Bauer, Tough Guy and other Romans still waste time fighting each other. Despite lava and pyroclastic flow moving very slowly, the success rate of the escape will be very low.Kit Harington of GOT fame is Milo. He's cute but really short. All the other male leads are taller and the actress playing Cassia was probably chosen just because shorter than him (in the best Alan Ladd-Veronica Lake tradition). A final word of demerit for the unbelievably bad CGI."
" CGI and historical untruths.
",2017-09-19 00:00:00,2,"I confess I had some curiosity about this movie. Disaster films with volcanoes are no longer new (""Volcano"" and ""Dante's Peak"" are good examples) but a film about a real historical fact as dramatic as the destruction of Pompeii (and the nearby city of Herculaneum) in 79 AD, is somewhat unusual. Unfortunately its much weaker than I thought it would be.The plot is simple: a Celt, captured and enslaved after Romans massacred his family, becomes a successful gladiator and gets the attention of a wealthy Roman girl, disappointed in her culture's cruelty. When Vesuvius erupts, he will have the chance to flee with her and avenge his family, as the girl's forced bridegroom is, precisely, the one responsible for the massacre that has killed them. The influence of films and series such as ""Gladiator"", ""Rome"" and ""Spartacus"" is evident, but the fact is that the script is frankly underdeveloped, with characters so basic that we can summarize each one in a single word. Another problem I felt was the partiality of the plot, demonizing Roman civilization. The end of the film tries to be unpredictable but isn't properly capable of that, besides that makes everything too melodramatic. About historical accuracy... forget it. Who wrote the script totally ignored historical facts. That bombs or that tsunami are obscenities that attempt to the intelligence of those who know the basic about what actually happened in Pompeii.Paul W.S. Anderson has a bad name as a director but this was his first movie that I actually watched. In this case, I recognize reason in the criticisms: he's a weak director, dazzled with the CGI but incompetent in the direction of the cast and the script. Regarding the cast, there are some heavy names like Kit Harington, Emily Browning and Kiefer Sutherland, but the performances were generally mediocre and uncompromising. It is true that the characters are too basic and underdeveloped but the actors also did not feel like sweating the shirt by their characters. Browning, for example, was unable to build a chemistry with his romantic pair. That intense love that should have existed is never there and everything sounds unlikely and artificial. Sutherland, who was the villain, is simply ham and histrionic. The best actor here was Akinnuoye-Agbaje, with a performance capable of harmonizing strength and action with some psychological depth and drama.Visually, the film is a CGI feast and visual and sound effects of good quality and a lot of impact, mainly from half the film to the end. Cinematography helps, emphasizing the colors and with the camera moving quickly in the action scenes. The problem is that these were the only aspects where the film was really good, and this is not enough to make the movie good. It just makes it bearable."
" Twilight meets Gladiator and Titanic making out. (sort of)
",2017-09-07 00:00:00,2,"This movie is what happens when you are trying to create Gladiator and Titanic, but if the Titanic was sinking slowly and nobody was dying for it, Gladiator was ornamental, John Snow looked uninteresting, the hottest lady around is that lady from Sucker Punch, Jack Bauer was evil and bored and Killer Croc... well, he kept his standards, while Trinity looks bored.For history fans, it is offensive over the limits. For science fans, it is terrible. For physicists it breaks every rule known. For toxicologists is laughable. For love story fans, it is really boring. For action fans it is overly long and terribly edited. For CGI fans it is terrible. For practical effects fans... Pfft. Keep dreaming. It offers nothing to anyone. Even at the end you just want it to end before you actually take your life out of boredom. (I wanted it to end around 45 minutes earlier, but beggars can be choosers)Dull at its finest. Clich√© to a maximum level. They tried to make it a safe movie and ended doing a boring mess. I give it a point because my fan fiction about Trinity giving birth the dancer from sucker punch, which marries Jon Snow, whose best buddy is Killer Croc, While Jack Bauer tries to conquer Westeros is a million times better after watching this abomination."
" It's not that bad
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,6,"Why all the hate for this movie? It's not that bad. Yes i agree , it's clich√© and the screenplay is a little one dimensional bur it's easy tio follow and not pretentious. On the other hand , I've never seen a gladiator movie with a natural disaster before. That's something new. And the special effects are beautiful, must be spectacular in 3D. I enjoyed watching the movie as popcorn flick nothing more. 6/10 for the sword fights and special effects. 2/10 for story"
" Ending could have been better.
",2017-08-12 00:00:00,2,"With all the bad movies being made over the last couple of decades, I did enjoy this. That is, until the ending. Being as it was all fictional, the ending could have been much better, especially with special effects. Mostly, I'm picturing a rain shower over the kissing statues and a renewal of life, if you will. It would have left me feeling warm and fuzzy after spending 2.5 hours of my life watching it instead of feeling cheated out of a good ending."
" Not the best
",2017-08-12 00:00:00,7,"I watched this for Kit Harrington. To see him in something else besides GOT. Well, at least he knew something. But there are so many stereotypes. Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back, boy kisses girl, they both die. Atticus dying ""I die free"", shades of STARGATE and nobody gets out alive!"
" You will love it if you love history.
",2017-08-08 00:00:00,8,"It's a movie based on the history of Mount Vesuvius. It erupted AD 79 and it's lava destroyed entire Pompeii. In this movie, you will see the love of the destruction. As I love history, I loved this movie so much. May be I'll go there to visit Pompeii someday. You will observe something different in this movie."
" I think this is a love it or hate kind of movie..
",2017-08-07 00:00:00,6,"Saying that, I didn't particularly fall crazy in love with this film, but I did like it. If you enjoy movies of this type of genre then I say, give it go. Yes, it's titled Pompeii, but don't be fooled into thinking that the movie is based & focuses on Pompeii itself. I do believe that it hardly follows true events of what really happened back when the volcano blew its top, but the storyline they went with & used wasn't that bad.. I thought the special effects did OK & wasn't poorly done & the acting wasn't bad in any way either. I do feel slightly disappointed, they could of really gone to town with the blood, guts & grisly stuff beings as they chose to focus the storyline around fighting, gladiators & more fighting, but the movie lacked any of the sort."
" Kit is hot, the movie is not
",2017-07-31 00:00:00,5,"I only give this movie a 5 because of Kit Haringtons rock hard abs and sweet face. I absolutely love him. Otherwise it would get like, a 3? It's a big budget movie with a terrible script. I don't understand how it can be so bad. But my crush on Kit is stopping me from giving it a really bad grade. Every actor except for Kit sucks in this movie. The director must have been terrible. Thats all. If you want to see Kits abs, google them. They are GLORIOUS."
" When is the Stupid Volcano Going to Erupt???
",2017-07-24 00:00:00,4,"My wife turned this movie on last week when it was playing on the Syfy channel. When I came into the room where my wife was watching, I did a double-take because my wife doesn't really watch the Syfy channel that much. I was like, ""Syfy....whaaat??"" It turns out my bride was watching Pompeii, and she was steaming angry. The movie was scheduled to run from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM on the Syfy channel, and my wife was mad that it was already 2:04 PM and the stupid volcano had not erupted yet. Instead there was a ridiculous gladiator scene going on the screen to amuse the ""Roman Senator"" Kiefer Sutherland (side note: when I saw Kiefer Sutherland, I was like ""Kiefer Sutherland....whaaat?""). The clock hit 2:15 PM, and my wife's blood lust for death by volcano had still not been satisfied. Finally, the volcano blew at 2:24 PM, giving us viewers only 36 minutes (including commercials) to revel in the mass destruction and death caused by Vesuvius. One of the first casualties of the volcano was Carrie-Anne Moss, who was also inexplicably in this film. I think I heard Carrie-Anne Moss say one sentence from the time I started watching at 2:04 PM and the time she died 25 minutes later. Later, Carrie-Anne Moss! I think my wife's anger slowly faded as more and more people were murdered by that evil volcano. She probably would have enjoyed the volcano blowing during the opening credits, but I guess there had to be some kind of love story that included Kiefer Sutherland woven in. I actually think it would be fun to see a movie where the volcano exploded during the opening credits and, as soon as the opening credits ended, the closing credits began rolling because everybody died during the opening credits. A movie like that would free up more time for me to watch other movies. And being able to watch other movies is the main reason why I watch movies in the first place."
" A truly awful attempt at a disaster movie
",2017-06-13 00:00:00,2,"I've never been the biggest fan of disaster movies but I gave this film a chance to see if it could change my mind but no this film is pretty terrible. The premise is set in old Roman times in the town of Pompeii a gladiator is trying to survive a massive volcano while trying to get justice for his family. Kit Harrington who plays Jon snow on game of thrones is the main character in this film and he is pretty bad. There is absolutely no emotion to his performance which makes it hard to care about him or any of the situations he is put into. He isn't given a lot to work with to be honest as his character is written to be really lifeless and clich√© when it comes to pretty much every situation. The one and only character I liked in this film was his gladiator ally played by Adewale akinnuoye-agbaje, he was the only person I cared about and he easily gave the best performance in this film which made him the most fun to watch. Emily Browning plays Harringtons love interest in this film and her character has nothing about her, I didn't buy there romance at all and it made me not care about her at all. Kiefer Sutherland is the bad guy in this film and my goodness he is absolutely awful in this film, one of the most over the top cheesy performances I think I have ever seen in any film. He just overdoes everything in this film and you just end up laughing at him for this film. Carrie Ann moss and Jared Harris are in this film but are completely wasted and really anybody could have played there roles in this film. The story in this film is completely paper thin and there is nothing to it. You won't care about the romance at all which means you won't care about anything until the end and by then it doesn't have any decent payoff. The script has some truly awful dialogue in it that usually just ends up making you laugh or sigh in disbelief by just how dull or ridiculous it is. The style of the film too its credit does have some fun over the top destruction scenes towards the end of the film. But this film is littered with truly awful CGI and truly awful action scenes, clearly the budget for this film was not big enough because pretty much every effect look awful in this film. For some reason during the action scenes after every hit and it is truly jarring to watch. Overall this film is an avoid at all cost type of film, do something better with your time then this mess of a film."
" Pompeii is a bombastic blend of romance, volcanic disaster, and gladiator battles; and a deeply flawed one
",2017-06-12 00:00:00,5,"Pompeii is just another one of your average swords-and-sandals adventure. But is the difference here? There is a giant volcano that plays a vital role in the story. That is because this film is inspired by the final days of the historical Roman city Pompeii before it was gravely devastated by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. This bombastic blend of romance, disaster, and gladiator battles is helmed by director Paul W. S. Anderson following his financial success of the 'Resident Evil' series. It is a fantastic treat from visual standpoint. But from a writing standpoint, it is a hot mess. Lacking in originality and crippled by a charmless script, this historical fails to scale the heights above a dumb popcorn flick, and settles for an unremarkable hack-and-slash adventure that only accounts for half of the excitement it is intended to be. In short, it stands as just another one of your noisy guilty pleasure actioners. Set in 79 A.D., this film centers on Milo (played by Kit Harrington), a Roman slave scarred by the slaying of his mother as a young boy, who escapes from slavery to compete in the gladiator wars in the city of Pompeii, pitted along side fellow Roman slave Atticus (played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) who's intent on killing him to garner his freedom. Upon his escape, he meets the eyes of the beautiful Cassia (played by Emily Browning) who is sadly set to marry the ruthless Roman Senator Corvus (played by Kiefer Sutherland), the man responsible for his mother's death. When the towering Mount Vesuvius erupts with no warning, the entire city of Pompeii is plunged into wide scale chaos. In the amidst of escaping through the shower volcanic fireballs, Milo must race to find Cassia who is trapped inside the debris before it is too late.If you picture Ridley Scott's 'Gladiator' and fuse it with a disaster flick such as 'Volcano' or 'Dante's Peak', that is an accurate portrait of this historical epic is. If there is anything missing, it maybe just a pinch of 'Titanic' in the mix. After all, this movie does follow a love story in the amidst of an impending doom. But the ultimate question is: Is this movie exciting? For a disaster flick, it has its moments of excitement, most of which are granted in the final third during the volcanic eruption. But that is before the hour mark when the movie spends its time introducing the characters and treating us to a series of intense, but lousily edited gladiator battles. Anderson exhibits these sequences using an unfavorable gimmick involving quick cuts in which he cuts the camera nearly every time someone is slashed and beaten with a sword or some bladed weapon. Whether or not the reason behind this is to shield the graphic details to score a PG-13 rating, it tears away the excitement. The real excitement does not begin until the eruption of Mount Vesuvius which marks the film's climax. Anderson greatly composites this sequence with a prolonged string of CGI explosions and flashy special effects that effectively stage the harrowing destruction of the Ancient city. The body count is enormously high, and the special effects bring a helping hand to showcasing the grim atmosphere of this horrifying disaster. Sadly, this is about the only chunk of compulsion Anderson has to offer here. The movie is sorely depraved of decent performances from its cast. This includes Kit Harrington who's brought great appeal as Jon Snow in the TV series 'Game of Thrones', but here his performance is rather stoic. The worst can certainly be said for Kiefer Sutherland who neglects an authentic portrayal of a ruthless Roman senator and instead settles for a hammy performance that comes off more comical than realistic. While it is definitely unreasonable to anticipate something like Joaquin Phoenix's performance in 'Gladiator', Sutherland should been much better than what he delivers here.Pompeii is a bombastic blend of romance, disaster, and gladiator battles that falls short of flair and compulsion, and fails to level up to anything above a surface level popcorn actioner. There is some excitement to be experience here, but unfortunately it all comes in small separate chunks. There is a big, loud volcanic eruption here, but the movie itself is certainly no eruption itself."
" Disappointing
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,3,"Pompeii is probably the one city of the ancient Roman era we know the most about thanks to the fact that the eruption froze the city in time - we know what people talked about, what they worked with, what their concerns were.And yet, the one movie about the destruction of Pompeii unfortunately focuses more on a gladiator than any one else in the city. And that is so unfortunate, since with Spartacus, Gladiator and a few other features, it seems Hollywood has locked itself up with a gladiator that refuses to let them out. So instead of a movie about the actual retired Syrian marine (for example) who worked as a bronze maker and his day to day, we get another hack n' slash. it's lazy, but even worse it's plain cowardice, that Hollywood couldn't make this movie more about the actual people of Pompeii.So it was a disappointment from a script perspective, but the historical accuracy also left a lot to be desired, and the CGI was... abysmal. I'm not one who really notices matte paintings that much in movies, but here it was painfully obvious, and all the damn time.So all in all, what I thought would be a disaster movie set in history, just turned out to be something that should not have been made.Watch Gladiator, Rome or Spartacus instead. It's not about an exploding mountain, but their production values are way higher."
" Saved by special effects
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,6,"I purchase this picture on blu-ray because l have others Pompeii DVD and l want it to complete my collection about the city, but the story is silly and lack of veracity as harbor have big waves, actually the plot doesn't fits with real story and events happened in this city, even Pompeii didn't has large streets and buildings, besides the special effects are great since the volcano until almost destruction the city, forget the story it works as an entertainment only!!"
" The end blew it
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,5,"Overall the movies was good. The cast was good, it all looked very beautiful, nice fighting scenes. Okay it was full of clich√©s but which movie isn't?The movie was good until they entered the arena everything from there was just predictable. After the volcano erupted the movie ended for me. Okay you can have a lot of luck but really? this much? first Atticus that is running to the harbor, helps a girl and runs faster then that flood? and a boat blocks the only gate in that wall, really? of course something else that was bothering me was the always returning bad guys, they were everywhere.. During every chase the ground was falling apart and fireballs crushed near them, but when they started to fight it ALL stopped. Really?Overall the movie was good but the eruption of the volcano should have been the end for me."
" Inaccurate; bordering on absurdity
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,4,"This is what you get when they give $80 million to a bad director & a rotten script but with a good crew.It is as historically inaccurate as imaginable. I recommend listening to the local vulcanologists about the real events. Not your TV cable network celebrity hosts. The real quake damage was days before the eruption because they were repairing the city when it was buried.On this movie, there was no ash & pellets from the sky which buried Pompeii under 40 ft for 2 days.The city was preserved IRL under the ash & pebbles. Not trashed & burned as shown, although roofs caved in under the heavy ash. Any moron knows a tsunami travels away from the source. Not toward it. This idiot had the ocean & ships surging into town. The real tsunami surged across the bay away from the volcano. Did the director & scriptwriter even bother to look up Pompeii on the computer? They certainly lacked any basic common sense. This director is a violence freak and lived up to his reputation & killed everyone.The Romans treated their gladiators & slaves better than this. That was not the southern US or West Indies. Again, morons. Rome had very strict laws about the rights of gladiators.Then they killed off all the heroes & no one survives. What kind of jerk would write or direct such an ending. Who was dumb enough to give this violence freak $80 million for this movie? IRL Most of the real citizens escaped except their slaves left behind, the poor, elderly & stubborn. But most citizens escaped except those who waited too long & had no ship to leave on. They only found a few dozen in Pompeii. Herculaneum had over 100 found under the docks.Even the gladiator game was awful. The only things worthwhile were the costumes, sets & effects and the younger actors.This film is for those poorly educated who don't care about inaccuracies or killing the entire cast."
" Amazing, but not so
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,7,"This movie got everything from a typical historical one, but with a lot of visual effects, action, drama and a little of ""adventure"", shall I say. The characters played their roles in the best way possible and... nothing to argue about that. We have the all-known arenas where slaves fight for their lives, the crowd cheering when someone dies and two men who thought they could regain their freedom. Last but not least, the mountain which erupts in a torrent of blazing lava is the one which causes serious damage to the city and lets people with the impression they could survive such an atrocity. I personally expected an happy end, where somebody could have survived, but the actual thing was something that I didn't expect. It is a great movie, indeed, and deserves to be watched and appreciated for its true value and message."
" Oooh-er missus, that's a big eruption

Director Paul WS Anderson may have been inspired by the writings of Roman Scholar Pliny The Younger, but this not a cerebral movie by any means. The dialogue is hackneyed, the story-line is predictable and the heroes are so preposterously good looking they could have fallen out of a fragrance advert, but it's also loads of rollicking good fun providing you switch your brain off. Needless to say, it opens with a massacre. Young Brit Milo wakes up one night to find his hometown being attacked by a Roman Legion led by the boo-hiss Senator Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland). After seeing his entire family murdered in front of his eyes, Milo barely escapes only to walk right into the clutches of a slave-trading gang. Fast forward seventeen years and Milo, now looking like a ridiculously buffed-up Kit Harington has found himself working as a Gladiator. Well, forced to be one on pain of death anyway. Fate conspires to send him to the city of Pompeii where he catches the eye of Cassia (Emily Browning), the daughter of the local Governor and also falls afoul of Corvus who happens to be in the area. Soon, he's the hero of the arena and his defiance of Rome threatens to cause some major upheaval, until Mount Vesuvius erupts and causes an even bigger, fierier upheaval.Now, if that sounds a bit like the plot to 'Gladiator' with a massive great volcano slung on the end, you'd be right. The lovers from different ends of the social spectrum plot is also reminiscent of 'Titanic' while the city-levelling final-act clearly owes a debt to '2012,' 'The Day After Tomorrow' and a dozen other disaster- films. 'Pompeii' isn't as good as any of them. It's a B-movie with a blockbuster budget and it's so preposterous it manages to ratchet up a bigger body count than 'Gladiator' even before the volcano starts to steam. As daft as it gets though, it's popcorn-munching fun every step of the way, especially when Sutherland is on screen speaking in a preposterous British accent and threatening to chew up the scenery. The fight scenes are very well done too, for while Anderson doesn't have the strongest back-catalogue he can handle an action sequence. The arena battles are bloody, there's a well-orchestrated chariot chase through a burning street and the destruction of the titular town is an eye-popping spectacle, especially when rocks start flying into ships and taking out temples.So yeah, not a good film in the strictest sense but decent enough to kill a Sunday afternoon with. Kit Harington doesn't have the gravitas of Russell Crowe but he's an easy hero to cheer on. His love story with Browning isn't really a love story at all and is closer to a randy teenager lusting after a bad-boy football Captain, but Sutherland's ridiculous villain steals every scene he's in. Loads of people are going to hate this and you can pick holes in it with no trouble at all, but if you want a good old-fashioned Hollywood matin√©e film and don't want to think too much, 'Pompeii' is great. Well, not great, but you know."
" Poorly done rip-off of Gladiator
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,3,"This movie is a poorly done rip-off of the movie Gladiator. Some scenes and even lines of the dialogue are clearly taken directly from Gladiator as is the general plot. Some blatant examples of copying Gladiator are the scene where Atticus discusses seeing his family in the afterlife, Milo throwing his weapon at Kiefer's character, they call Milo ""the Kelt"" similar to ""the Spainard"", blood dripping from his hand being the focus in the final fight scene, etc. Unless you for some reason really want to see a volcano watch Gladiator instead, even if you've seen it.The acting is bad especially by Kiefer Sutherland."
