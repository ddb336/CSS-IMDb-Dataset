" Otherwise great fun but not visually pleasing
",2021-03-24 00:00:00,8,For an old school action fan seeing all these legends on the screen has not gotten old but some unforgivably cheap cgi shots take down the enjoyment a whole lot but it was still great fun and i hope there will be more.
" Meh
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,3,A circle jerk of a bunch of has beens reliving their glory years with a bunch of fresh faces to try and keep them relevant. It's worth checking out if you enjoy action movies but I wouldn't pay money to own it.
" Worst of the 3 films
",2021-02-15 00:00:00,5,"Hooof... I get that they tried to be PC and get a chick in this film... but lordy... No better options than Ronda Rousey??? She is soooo bad !!!!
Had to pause to movie and leave for a moment because she is such a bad actress...
Hopefully they don't do the same mistake in the next one.."
" Not as good as the others
",2021-02-05 00:00:00,5,"They should had stopped with no 2. Its not as good, its infact boring at sometimes. It just dont add anything new to the series. And what an annoying soundtrack. It gave me stress"
" Action scenes barely above average. Acting and dialogue definitely below average.
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,5,"Yes it is good fun to see Arnie and Stallone and Mel Gibson etc fight it out, BUT the action scenes are nothing above average and the in between talking scenes are definitely quite tedious to watch.I hope the other Expandables edtions were better than this one, because this is rather embarrassing to watch."
" My opinion
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,5,"The movie is meh...but my biggest problem with the script is why did Barney (Stallone) leave his original crew for so long during the movie only to hire a bunch of uninteresting cry babies with no personalities.Billy the kid, the new recruit on Expendables 2 was a way better character,likable and with a good backstory.I was super sad when they killed him, they should've leave him for the rest of the franchise...He has chemistry with the old mercenaries. Banderas was good but too annoying,and Gibson was decent but that was all."
" Best of Three
",2020-12-05 00:00:00,3,"Third time is a charm. This movie hits all the right notes. It's still really cheesy and absurd, but there is no comparison between this one and the previous two. It's on a whole different level. It is actually enjoyable to watch. Just grab a bag of popcorn and press play. I still only give it 3 stars because the truth is none of these Expendables flicks are all that great. If these movies didn't exist we would all be just fine."
" One last time
",2020-12-05 00:00:00,7,"The last installment in the Adrenaline-filled Expendable series. Sylvester Stallone is amazing as ever, as the leader of the Expendables, Weasley Snipe is funny with his real references jokes, Harrison Ford is a good replacement of Bruce Willis, Mel Gibson is menacing as the villian, it's obvious that he's having fun with his character. Statham, Ludgren, Crews, & Rourke are all good in their roles, tho they're mostly sidelined in favor of the Newbies, speaking of which, I think their inclusion in the story kinda takes away the fun, this franchise is about the old school dudes having fun, telling jokes and one-liners, taking on bad guys and revisiting the good old days. But it's still cool, that they tried something new, Ronda Rousey is pretty cool.The action sequences are quite entertaining and fun; the gun shootouts and the explosions are well staged, but it's bit tone down 'cause of PG rating. The cinematography is good, and the score does it best and complements the scenes.
Overall, The last installment in the Expendables saga might've lose the wow factor, but has enough humor, guns and explosions to keep one entertained and engaged throughout."
" The Expendables 3: The Expendaning
",2020-11-17 00:00:00,6,"Just going to jump into this one. 3 is worse than 2 but the actors are better. The action, the lack of over the top violence, the awful CG, terrible one liners and what I feel to be mostly horrible use of Ford are offset by how unnervingly good Gibson is in this role. I suppose it's easy for him to play a violent psycho but it was fun to watch. The whole second team thing I could do without. Ford was poorly used except in the moments where he's tough on everyone and flexes his gravitas. Banderas and Snipes are fine but I wanted more, more Snipes especially.By the credits I knew this was a lesser movie and yet it was just as enjoyable as the predecessor so I'll give it a matching grade. By this point, you should know if these are for you and whether to watch it or not."
" ""The Expendables 4"" IDEA
",2020-11-06 00:00:00,10,"I think the next movie gets bigger, longer and extremely weird!
Do the normal action with all the actors that were in previous films add some comedians including: weird al, jack black, (if he isnt way too busy), Vermin Love Supreme and anyone who wants to try out."
" Enjoyed it
",2020-10-18 00:00:00,8,"My personal favourite of the the 3, most intriguing is the ' baddie ' Stonebanks is genuinely mad and upset some of his brothers in arms were killed when they were sent to Capture him, you get the sense he didn't want to lay down any hurt on his old crew which doesn't make him a good guy by any stretch but he did have loyalty, in turn he's set on taking this out on Ross, the first two I found very annoying in parts where as this one just flowed, hope you all enjoyed it too."
" The film has good moments, excellent additions to the cast and a great villain, the production wastes a lot of time trying to develop characters that nobody cares about
",2020-09-19 00:00:00,6,"After a second film that surpassed the original in several aspects, this third part manages to further develop the characters and further elevate the action. The first chapters of the series captivated the audience, not because of the brilliance of the plot (not least because the proposal wasn't even that), but because it reminded the old action movies of the 80s a lot. Now, that same audience wanted other stars in the cast, feeding rumors after rumors. The second part, especially, had a more interesting plot than the first, but he did not lose his good acid mood and increased the number of punch lines, the phrases of films that are famous.Since The Expandables 2 there is a clear option for self-debauchery, whether playing with the age of the protagonists or with facts related to some of them. Mercenaries 3 follows this same line. Soon, the expectation for the third film in the franchise was huge, as was the cast. Sly seemed to have taken down each of the suggestions that appeared on the internet and added to the already existing group of mercenaries a few major actors like Harrison Ford, Antonio Banderas, Wesley Snipes and called Mel Gibson to play the villain. Ready. Another successful sale.A lot has changed between the initial proposal and this last film in the franchise. The first film was a tribute to the action films of the 80s, bringing everything that these films delivered to us: cartoon villains, plans revealed at the last minute, hero shooting everyone and saving the girl, and a lot of gore in between. The film worked well because it embraced that idea and gave in to it. The second, on the other hand, changed its course a little while trying to mix this original idea with the comedy created by the huge number of action stars, and the third film is the conclusion of this change in direction.Australian director Patrick Hughes in developing, in fact, a story involving the characters. There is a whole dramatic arc involving replacing battle veterans with a younger team, underscoring the need for new blood in Barney Ross (Stallone) 's team. With that, it is necessary to present the new characters and their respective skills, which takes a long time, as well as justifying the return of the old people (you didn't think they would be left out of the game, did you?). This whole stretch makes The Expandables 3 by far the series film with the best developed script, but it also reduces the number of action scenes, which are punctuated more at the beginning and at the end of the feature film. Another change easily noticed in this third film is in relation to violence. As much as The Expandables 3 continues to be very violent, there is care that there is no blood on the big screen. All aiming at a decrease in the age classification in the United States, in order to reach a wider audience. However, action fans need not fear: there are good doses of adrenaline, with the right to several impossible scenesStill, it is a film with fun moments. Starting with the rescue of the character of Wesley Snipes, right at the beginning, entitled to the unusual scene of a helicopter hiding from a cannon and the joke involving why he was arrested, regarding the life of the actor himself, who was serving time for evasion. Supervisor. Throughout the film, there are several dialogues in this sense, with the aim of referring to old successes or even problems faced by the film, such as the departure of Bruce Willis for not accepting the fee offered. It's The Expendables making fun of himself, demonstrating the good humor that guides the series. Between catchphrases and catchphrases, for example, fans of Predador (1987) may see Arnold Schwarzenegger this time shouting ""Get to the choppa!"", Instead of the classic ""I'll be back"".Despite the intense opening scene, typical of action films that sometimes mimic, sometimes pay homage, the first half of ""The Expandables 3"" is sleepy. The opening sequence is the one that stands out the most, especially in the pace in which Doc is rescued, where, in addition to the great scene under a moving train (ignore the horrific CGI effects), we are treated to sinister dialogues, racist jokes and puns personal details of Wesley Snipes himself (which is the big highlight). In the second stage, with the arrival of the new group (most of whom present poor performances or need charisma), they can no longer bear to hear explosions. In this respect, the regular filmmaker Patrick Hughes conceives good plans, but fails miserably in the total narrative construction. Ross's motivations for dropping old partners, for example, do not convince his friends or the public. The time-consuming recruitment of the new team follows. Kelsey Grammer plays the guy who helps Barney find his new warriors. As the cliché says, Barney runs into each of them at the providential moment when they are showing off their skills.In the cast, Mel Gibson demonstrates that there is still that actor inside that we know and admire, giving us memorable roles like William Wallace in Braveheart. There is no mistake in his performance and it is a pleasure to see him perform so diligently. His scenes with Stallone are exquisite. Two other actors who also stood out were Banderas and Snipes, both for making laughs with incredible scenes and dialogues, something worthy of the franchise. Snipes starts well, but soon sees his crazy persona take on a tertiary position. Banderas takes the comic bias of the film in his pocket and entertains. Harrison Ford, hired at the last minute after the Bruce Willis stampede, passes by. To close, Arnold Schwarzenegger further reduces his screen time.Compared to previous films, The Expendables 3 is a much more balanced film, that is, he does not overdo the jokes like the second film and does not take himself as seriously as the original. Regarding the story proposal, the clash between Barney and Conrad is the most interesting of the three films, without a doubt. However, the long slide - and ugly - in the most important aspect of all, which is fun. While the previous ones had R censorship and were totally aimed at the audience that grew up watching the films starring Stallone, Schwarzenegger and co, the third one tried to win the interest of the younger ones through two devices: the PG-13 censorship, allowing kids more nova could watch the movie in theaters; and the inclusion of younger actors in the cast, in order to create an identification with the younger ones.
With the formula of the series once again well applied, there is plenty of room for some ""newbies"" to stand out. Powell, Lutz, Rousey and Ortiz, worked very well and knew how to get along with the rest of the cast. Regarding fights, no one impresses more than Ronda Rousey - not by chance, she is a UFC fighter and specialist in solo techniques. Together, they make the beginning of ""The Expendables 3"" an extensive (and unnecessary) preview of what is already known: the return of the veterans in the final part. The new team only serves as a surrender to a spectrum of the action genre that the first two films in the series sought to distance themselves: that of technological paraphernalia, of intelligence on brute force. Formerly obscene, the shooting and fighting scenes become conservative and friendly, with quick cuts and a distance from the painting that show Australian director Patrick Hughes constantly fleeing blood.The film wastes a lot of time trying to do the impossible: getting us interested in the troupe of young mercenaries. They occupy precious space within the plot, do not convince anyone and look like a hindrance. As the story is badly linked, the action scenes end up seeming empty and repetitive, although well done. Better than the original, but inferior to The Expendables 2, this new sequel continues to bet firmly on the originality of the encounter on the screens of certain actors, as happens between Stallone and Harrison Ford or Mel Gibson, for example. For those who grew up watching and having fun with the films of these stars, there is an inherent symbolism in each of these moments. In the end, it is a film that entertains, even if it does not have a remarkable moment like the appearances of Chuck Norris in the previous episode of the series.Regarding the great action sequences, The Expendables 3 unfortunately does not live up to its predecessors, having scenes well below both in terms of quantity and quality. The only really exciting action sequences are the sequel in Somalia and the grand final battle between the old school mercenaries and the new generation against the army funded by Conrad Stonebanks. It is a pity to think that a director with such great potential as Patrick Hughes was unable to create action scenes as competent as his previous film, the great Red Hill (2010).With a literally explosive conclusion, this The Expandables 3 seems to be the closing of the franchise. Even because the wear is evident. The joke no longer works. In sum, the feeling is tired and repetitive. Unfortunately, The Expendables 3 is yet another film stricken by the fearsome curse of the third film. As much as it presents good moments, excellent additions to the cast and a great villain, the production wastes a lot of time in which it could deliver fun scenes to try to develop characters that nobody cares about. And if you intend to continue with the franchise, do something relatively new, don't just call big names for a reunion that has been absolutely sterile. Much is said about making a female version of the Mercenaries, it would be at least curious."
" Mind-numbing and moronic
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,2,"The Expendables 3 (aka Toxic Masculinity 3) is about as dumb as you'd expect. Plot takes a back seat most of the way through so that we can just watch an endless parade of lunkheads blowing crap up. They bring back all your favorites from the first two films, and even waste 20 minutes of our time in the middle introducing a new cast of younger people. I always thought the point of these stupid movies was to give washed up action movie stars one last hurrah before they have to hang it up, but now we have to meet a series of no-name youngsters who will be prominently featured through the rest of the film. Not that I care all that much since every character in these movies feels like the same guy with a slightly different look. They all are basically indestructible, and simultaneously perfect at everything they do. It's kind of mind-numbing when you see everyone playing the same tough, hard-edged dude with zero charisma, and a complete unwillingness to admit any flaws. And, no, adding one token female to the mix doesn't help in any way. Frankly, they couldn't have made Ronda Rousey act more like a guy if they tried.I will give one small caveat to my complaints about The Expendables 3, and that is Antonio Banderas. While everyone else is running around trying to compensate for what the steroids have done to their penises, he is actually trying something different. He's got a quirky, silly personality that genuinely made me laugh. It's like they actually allowed one of the heroes to be insecure and less than perfect, and it was delightful. Otherwise, this movie was just as bad or worse than the two that came before it. This joins a select group of movies I've watched that are overflowing with action, and yet I manage to get bored with them. To be lumped in with a Transformers movie is not a good thing. In fact, in the final big battle, I lost all concept of space and location in the film. People were everywhere and it was impossible to track where the heroes were in relation to one another, which was made worse by the fact that we have like 27 heroes at this point. The Expendables 3 is for the crowd who like something less thought-provoking than a shut-your-brain-off movie, this is a remove-part-of-your-brain movie."
" Living off the edge performances
",2020-07-23 00:00:00,8,"Stallone's performance, gun skills, brotherly talk and acting is top-notch. I wish I could have seen more off Jason in the film. Mel Gibson's performance as villain is good. Terry and Arnold's giant muscular performance is too good. Added by new folks.
The action sequences are very good, not the best though.
I am waiting for more from this franchise."
" What was once a phenomenal action movie franchise, is now at an all-time low with the release of this ""film"".
",2020-07-21 00:00:00,4,"""The Expendables"" (2014), as soon as I heard that it was going for a PG-13 rating, I knew right then and there that this ""film"" would be all wrong. Why make a major action film with all of these actors if you're going to just limit your boundaries by going with a PG-13 rating instead of an R rating? Keep in mind, there are several PG-13 movies that I love, but a big action film like this should go for an R rating. Never limit your boundaries! But, that's beside the point, ""The Expendables 3"" has an overlong and cliched storyline, standard to mediocre acting, and a dull cliched soundtrack. The first two films nailed the aspects of a perfect action film. When you make an action movie trilogy, or any kind of movie trilogy, the first one is typically for character development plus story and action, the second is where you take the concept and expand upon it. The third film is where it's time to try something different. But, at the same time following a resembling format to the first two films. As for the story, they were on the right track on making it a more personal plot. In which, one of their own team members, presumed dead, has returned to take revenge on the Expendables. That's a classic action movie plot, but sadly, it was not expanded upon and it was played too pedestrian as a result of lazy script writing. Film Making 101: most movies and TV shows are nothing but recycled plot lines. The key to a great movie is to take a previously used concept and add something fresh to it. That way, it would be unique to your film, thereby making it stand out. On a side note, this ""film"" is over two hours in length. That's way too long for a basic storyline like this. I don't mind a long film well executed, but it has to keep my interest all the way through. In the case of ""The Expendables 3"", a story like this one should have ranged from 90-110 minutes max. Right after the 110 minute mark, it just starts to drag on. The other big issue with this story is bringing in a group of younger characters. They really drag the story down, what little there is! Speaking of which, the acting in this ""movie"" is standard to mediocre. Granted, most of the acting is still passable, with the exception of the younger cast members. They gave the worst performances in this ""film"". Those actors are: Ronda Rousey, Kellan Lutz, Glen Powell and Victor Ortiz. None of them can act by any means necessary. That being said, maybe they'll improve as their career goes on. Now, I do understand where Sylvester Stallone, the writer of this ""movie"" was going. He was trying to use this ""film"" as a way to introduce the younger generations of acting. But sadly, their marred performances totally distracted from the minuscule cliched plot. The best performances come from the older action stars, such as: Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Wesley Snipes, Mel Gibson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Antonio Banderas, Kelsey Grammer, Harrison Ford, Terry Crews, Dolph Lundgren and Robert Davi. Their performances are great! One of the better performances though is Mel Gibson as Conrad Stonebanks, the main villain. Once again, we have a bad ""film"" with a great villain! As for the soundtrack, it's hit and miss. It does work for the most part, but in some parts it just sounds like it's looped. Almost kind of like it was rushed together at the last second of editing in post-production! Editing in a movie is supposed to be seamless and unnoticeable. When you notice the edits, then you know that something is very wrong. This soundtrack is completely dull and forgettable. There are only two positives in this ""movie"", which are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are nice and give the ""movie"" a decent atmosphere. The only other positive is the special effects. All of the special effects were well-done and still hold up today. ""The Expendables 3"" is a massive disappointment in the genre of action films. I give it 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Stay away from ""The Expendables 3""! There is an unrated version, but it's hardly any different from the theatrical PG-13 cut. I'm just thankful they learned their lesson, because ""The Expendables 4"" (if they ever decide to make it) will be R rated!"
" Things go BOOM!!
",2020-07-11 00:00:00,3,"I keep hoping for something beyond a live-action comic book but after three of these I've stopped hoping. The forced cliches, plodding and often inaudible dialogue and tiresomely predictable plot lines, over and over and over and.......just can't keep me interested enough to watch a fourth edition (a virtual certainty) despite the, admittedly, pretty awesome action photography and special effects.But, as the still impressive box office returns show, Sylvester has got another reliable money making movie franchise going so I'm sure he'll milk it completely dry. I can't fault him for that."
" Star studded cast
",2020-07-07 00:00:00,5,And a let down of a movie! This movie had to have lost money like I lost my money renting it?
" Not good mate. The first was the best
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,3,I usually love these type of films but this was just 2hrs of ott testosterone and what's it measuring. Basically middle aged men to old farts grunting at each other. I really admire Arnold and Sly as they're impressive at their age doing this stuff. BUT Antonio banderas was super super annoying in this film. The less said about gibson the better. Also Dolp lungren was killed off in the first film so didn't understand that.
" Expendables 3: The one with the Rookies.
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,6,"The idea of the franchise in one phrase is ""retro-fun"" bring back all the action stars from the past and put the in a movie together, to shoot everything. The stories in these movies are always going to be placed behind the action, which is fine. You don't watch a movie like this for riveting writing, as long as it's passable and not cringe.With this 3rd entry, they kind of lost the way a bit. They decide to replace the main team with boring, 1 dimensional characters who nobody cares about, and for no reason. Take out all the young characters, you still get the same story over 90 minutes instead of 130 minutes with the same result. (Rhonda was the only decent youngster, the boys were all terrible and basically the same character).However, there are some good newcomers to the franchise too. As much as I love Willis, I think Ford is more believable as a CIA guy, and Willis could have been one of the Expendables (he's John Mclane!). Snipes is pretty good as an unhinged guy who has been in captivity for 8 years. Banderas' Galgo is basically like a Spanish Deadpool but is likeable for his enthusiasm, and you feel empathy for him when you find out what happened to his team.Finally, Mel Gibson as the villain is an excellent choice. His delivery in his lines has more conviction and menace than Roberts villain, and he's more charismatic than Van Damme's deadly but pretty dull Vilain (though why did they say he was Australian, only for him to refer to himself as American?). Too bad Robert Davi wasn't in the movie longer, could have maybe had him as Stonebanks partner for the duration.Special mention also to Kelsey Grammar for adding a touch of class as well. Always a pleasure to watch an actor like him who can make the corniest of dialogue sound well written."
" The film is good
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,8,"The film is good but despite being the weakest in the franchise, it is still worth watching."
" Not as good as part 2, but not bad
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,7,"It is rare in a film trilogy that both sequels are superior to the first film. This one was very good,but took a little too long setting up the story. Also it features more of the younger new cast rather than the action legends that these movies are really about. That being said it still is worth a watch and was well made.
My order of how I would grade these movies is Part2 (7.5),Part3 (7),Part1 (6.5). I watched all three movies on a binge so that are my thoughts."
" A great action movie with all the right instincts
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,8,"Seeing all the negativity about this film I thought I'd chip in. I very much enjoyed this movie! The action is great as is the photography and especially the editing which most moviegoers don't even seem to realise is there. The distinct lack of blood if anything made the movie better because the rapid and kinetic editing is far more pleasurable than watching unrealistic fountains of fake blood and ripped apart limbs to be honest. Basically all 80's Action stars are assembled in this movie which also boasts much better effects than it's predecessors and also a much better written script. So please give this box-office bomb a chance, just because it's not the glorification of violence Rambo V - Last Blood sadly turned out to be it doesn't mean this film doesn't deliver what it is supposed to!"
" GREAT ACTION PACKED FUN WITH AN AMAZING ENSEMBLE CAST
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,7,"I love The Expendables films & part 3 is just as much fun as the other two in my opinion. I know we have a younger team that joins forces with our main team of old school action heroes & lots of people didn't like that but it didn't bother me as the younger team are pretty cool but obviously no where near as good as the proper team of aging action stars.
Now to be really honest i would say that the first Expendables film is the best made & has the best old school style story but each film is an exciting blast of old school action in their own way.
I felt there was more Heart in this film than the others & although a slightly lighter tone as in hardly any blood splatter but it doesn't ruin anything at all as the entertainment value is extremely high with 3rd act as one of the greatest big Action scenes ever & i would say that i personally like part 3 the best & with addition of Banderas, Ford, Snipes, Gibson & Grammer it's a blast of exciting entertainment.
I didn't like the silly pop music & this 3rd film is definitely the most ""Kid Friendly"" & the most ""Marvel"" feeling but it's still a big budget fun action packed popcorn Thriller.
Here we get some new additions & they are Awesome with the likes of the 90's action star Wesley Snipes, he has made some Amazing films back in his day with Passenger 57, Demolition Man (with Stallone), Money Train, Blade 1&2, Drop Zone, Murder At 1600, New Jack City & US Marshalls among others, Snipes is an action legend in his own right & is great here as one the Expendables old members that they break out of prison in the fantastic thrilling opening action sequence. Snipes plays Doc a man who is an expert with Knives & there's some funny banter between him & Statham's knife throwing Lee Christmas. Snipes fits into the rugged ageing old school action hero team perfectly & i said in part one that the team was missing Snipes. Also in this underrated Sequel we get the great Kelsey Grammar as Bonaparte another old member of the team & it's so Cool having ""Frasier"" in the group & he gives a good performance on screen with Stallone's Barney Ross. We also get the Hollywood legend Harrison Ford as Max Drummer, taking over from Bruce Willis & we get Antonio Banderas as Galgo a non-stop talking new member & we get a nice little role from the B-movie action legend Robert Davi as an arms dealer. Now the main villain here is the legendary Mel Gibson as an ex-member of the Expendables named Conrad Stonebanks & it's an Awesome performance from Gibson, the cast of legendary talent is on Fire here!!!
The standout star of the younger team is the sexy & deadly Ronda Rousy as Luna. We also get a bigger part for the King of Action himself Schwarzenegger!!! Back as Trench & all the old faces are back again.Part 3 is a very slick looking film & is probably the most fun of the Trilogy & has plenty of Awesome action scenes & funny banter & two Cinema greats going head to head with Stallone & Gibson.
A really entertaining piece of action cinema with a huge cast of greats"
" Captures the Franchise's Spirt, and Has an Abundance of Blood-less, But Excessive, Violence
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,10,"Yes, it's rated PG-13, and yes it's the least-liked of the three, but I for one, thought it was on par with the other two films in the series.Unlike many people, I don't need my action movies to be sadistic and bloody to enjoy them. I don't need people to be blown up, I don't need to see severed limbs and fountains of blood. I just don't need graphic violence. Sure it can be entertaining, in a morbid way, and sure it's an important ingredient in an action film. But action movies don't need that to still work and be fun. There are many great examples of PG-13 action films that excelled with little strong violence. Taken (2008), any of the post-The Living Daylights (1987) Bond films, the Bourne films, and Live Free or Die Hard (2007), to name a few. Granted, the old-school hardcore 80s and 90s violent action vibe was an attraction of this series, but it's still there. The set-pieces are just as big, the action is almost as brutal and just as entertaining, and the performances are still strong. A movie doesn't need to be a gritty hard R to be fun.Everyone is back from the first film, well, most everyone, with mostly solid performances from the regulars, and some ok performances from the young newcomers. Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Statham, Crews, Couture, and Lundgren are all good as usual. Jet Li has more screen time than he did in the previous film, but he doesn't have very much time to show off his martial arts skills. Schwarzenegger has almost as much to do as the previous film, and he still kills bad guys and makes fun of himself well, even saying ""get to da choppa"" at one point. Part of the novelty of the series are the new cast members every movie, and this one doesn't disappoint. We have Wesley Snipes and Antonio Banderas, who steal most of the scenes they're in, and it was really cool to see Snipes in action again, and Banderas too. Harrison Ford replaces Bruce Willis as the team's CIA liaison, and is brings a certain level of class to the film. Mel Gibson, though, totally steals the show as the psychotic and memorable villain, and he may be the best of the series' antagonists. The young new members are ok, though they're not nearly as interesting as the older guys, and Rhonda Rousey is actually the most memorable of the new recruits.Patrick Hughes, a no-name up-and-comer in the directorial department, actually proves his mettle, crafting some great action sequences. The opening train scene was entertaining, the Somali car chase/shootout was crazy, and the final battle is pretty much about 30 minutes of non-stop, crazy action, with lots of fighting, explosions, and gunfire, and a crazy motorcycle stunt. Seriously the final sequence is great. It's pretty much The Expendables vs. a small army, and there are even tanks here. The final fight is brutal and visceral, and very entertaining, though it probably could have gone on for longer. Hughes is definitely a keeper, going on to do The Hitman's Bodyguard (2017), another favorite of mine. He's the closest thing we have to the new Michael Bay.If you can appreciate a fun PG-13 action flick, than this is for you. The scale of the acton is still there, and the movie does manage to maintain a little of the franchise's grit. Star charisma and creative vision completely drive this thing, and it's quite a spectacle.Actors I'd like to see in the fourth film: Kurt Russell, Steven Seagal, Jackie Chan"
" Action film not very interesting
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,6,A mediocre film . And the final boss deliberately fight with stallone without using his gun is ridiculous. That he risked his life in such a stupid way.
" This movie is alright
",2020-03-05 00:00:00,7,This is a fairly fun action movie with some fun performances but the action being nerfed down to a PG-13 rating definitely didn't do it any favors but it's still decent
" Big budget???
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,3,This movie must have had a hell of a lot of money to spend with so many A grade actors in such an ordinary movie
" Just let yourself go and enjoy the ride!
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,8,"This is what action-movies are all about, or rather, this is what action-movies USED to be all about : One hell of a rollercoaster-ride, a lot of fun one-liners, huge explosions, a lot of characters you actually care about (and love for old times sake) - Banderas and Snipes stands out.And this is a typical movie you don't need to think about and reflect on the moment the end credits start rolling, and yet that's exactly what I did... What was it about this movie that made me like it so much, that made me simply enjoy and forget time and place? And then it hit me, it is stripped of that nonsense political correctness. I mean, there is one female character in the cast (don't know who she is though) but it didn't ruin the experience.Absolutely loved this movie, hope they will continue this franchise."
" I enjoyed this movie
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,7,"After the mediocre first and insultingly stupid second part this one finally delivers what the series always set out to do: elderly action stars in ironic, fun action scenes. The humor works much better here and doesn't feel as forced as before and the new additions are great. Especially Gibson obviously had fun with his villain role. Sure, this still isn't one of the smartest films ever made and it certainly wouldnt have needed the young additions. But at least the film is fun and thoroughly entertaining, unlike the stupid second part."
" Such a waste
",2020-02-21 00:00:00,2,"There is zero redeeming qualities to this movie. Its almost like watching a Lifetime drama about how legit actors can agree on such a pointless, horrid written, and uncareable script you can get. Like serious actors, that can read, still say- ""yep, looks good to me"". The worst green screen shots of 1992 (if we were in 92), a DP who cant shoot and focus to save his life, and a Director who cant even see that he just cast MMA rejects that cant even deliver lines much less be entertaining (Ronda Rousey). Scenes that are placed for no reason, and then end for the same. One liner dialog that is repeated, thats right- REPEATED through the movie as if to say- ""Idk, give another chopper line Arnold- maybe nobody will notice"". I give one star to Sly for starting this off as a good concept and then for whatever reason giving it to the studio to destroy worse with each sequel. So sad kids, so sad."
" Good action movie
",2019-11-23 00:00:00,6,"Unfortunately, the watered down and bloodless action sequences make this Expendables the weakest installment but The Expendables 3 is still a good action movie and the action scenes are still over the top and enjoyable. All the returning expandables once again give great performances. Newcomers Wesley Snipes, Harrison Ford, Antonio Banderas and Kelsey Grammer are all great and very funny. Mel Gibson is a fantastic villain. It's well paced and both the music by Brian Tyler and the soundtrack are really good."
" Action icons blow stuff up, in an adrenaline action kick-ass testosterone flick!
",2019-10-31 00:00:00,8,"The Expendables 3 is a hell improvment over messy Expendables 2. Action icons for 2014 still blows up stuff buildings with tanks. Stallone got back to the roots where Rambo III (1988) left off. I like thid film is not better than the first one but I have enjoy this movie much more than the second one. I like very much, I like this movie so damn much. The Expendables 2 is a boring terrible slow paced dull movie of a mess. Third installment of this franchis is a decent solid action kick-ass testosterone flick. There are many older stars in this film, it doesn't change the fact that they all kick ass. This movie made less money than the first two movies did. This is a prototypical ""good"" action movie -- intense, perfectly executed, original action, shown to the tune of a forgettable and occasionally insulting story.The movie is rated PG-13 but it works, Live Free or Die Hard is rated PG-13 and it worked. Sylvester Stallone did an excellent solid performance returning his old team back with a new one. I like this film, I enjoy it a lot more than garbage The Expendables 2. That is just me people hate film because it has new genartions but I don't care, that want change my likings and joy for this film. Barney Ross (Stallone) is back this time he faces off with his old enemy Conrad Stonebanks (Mel Gibson), who used to be one of his team mates. He betray Barney and his old team but Barney tought he put him down but he didn't. Now Barney dismisses his old team members and he brings a new area of EXpendables who are younger and faster. The lastest mission becomes a clash of classic - old school style versus high-tech expertise in The Expendables most personal battle yet.The Expendables 3 rounds out this throwback trilogy with Mel Gibson coming in as the baddie he is the best of this movie and a bad-ass. While Stallone, Statham headline this final (for now anyway) film in the series. Wesley Snipes and a group of 'newcomers' join in the shootout and explosive fun. Arnold is back in a few key scenes and Antonio Bandaras is off the chain in all of his. A nice tough is Harrison Ford stepping in for Bruce Willis the movie plays out as it should. EX-3 is pure balls to the walls fun. It lacks a feasible plot but bottom line to see this many aging action icons in one film is worth it in the end. I like this movie because we finally see Wesley Snipes in this movie finally Stallone / Snipes reunite and it is their second colloboration since Demolition Man (1993). Yes I love Demolition Man to death, it is one of the best sci-fi futuristic action film to grace to home video screen ever. Welcoming back in-joke to Wesley Snipes who had been sidelined by the Feds for tax evasion. His character Doctor Death was also in prison for tax evasion I am a huge Snipes fan that is Demolition Man is my movie my favorite action movie. Ronda Rousey as Luna is in this movie the only girl she was in the EX team. Ronda Rousey is a former UFC Women's Bantamweight Champion and former WWE RAW Women's champion and as Luna she was fantastic and excellent I love her performance. Antonio Banderas was crazy in this movie also he reunites with Stallone since 1995 Assassins. Kellan Lutzwas also good in this movie I like his performance.There is a lot of shootouts, tanks destroying the building explosions and really balls to the action. We have tanks in this movie the last time we waw tanks in action films were in Rambo III (1988) and GoldenEye (1995) James Bond - 007. Patrick Hughes did directed this movie well much better than Simon West. I love the soundtrack Come With Me Now - Kongos. My favorite scene is in which Barney Ross is almost captured by Stonebanks henchman, but Barney pulls out his Colt Single Action Army and shoots the bad guys one by one. Stallone did an excellent job making the final film in the trilogy.The Expendables 3 unrated version is actually better than tetarical version. I have Unrated Edition on the Blu-ray disc and I don't regret having this film. The third movie actually Works really well. At 131 min, this film should have been the second film. Everything about this movie works, good story, much better acting, better use of Arnie and believable compared with him in 2. Harrison Ford is decent in this little role, much better than Willis, Gibson is a great bad guy, unlike the mess of a JVC in 2 and I loved how Barney Ross tries to protect his crew and hiring a younger crew of nobodies. This really makes you appreciate the old guys, including Banderas, and Snipes. I think this film deserves more respect. I like this film I think this will be my favorite Expendables movie. I love the first one, but I love this one more."
" Old and young Hollywood: how to coexist
",2019-08-26 00:00:00,6,"""Mercenari""'s word continues to extend itself, and arrives to include always more Hollywood bad guys with white hair (Antonio Banderas, Mel Gibson, Harrison Ford, Wesley Snipes), revealing that the play is in the significance of the cinematographic icon, more than in the concrete narration. As the previous films, the technical result is nothing excellent: an hard rock action movie in 80s style, quite stereotypical but finally not so bad.I taught that after the second chapter there wasn't more to say. Instead this movie calls another question, that is the exchange between old and young characters (actors), revealing that the real plot of the film is meta-cinematographical and is focused on the reaction between characters and actors, how this two natures can juxtapose themself each other and coexist.In conclusion, a normal action movie full, mainstream and all explosions, but with some interesting technical questions that can exorcise the risk of a giant and chaotic group of Hollywood stars. But I think it's time to stop: I'm worried for the imminent fourth chapter."
" Does not deserve such a high rating.
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,4,"As a fan of the first two films:
What a let down.
For some reason, unexplained, they ridiculously made a PG13 Expendables, then got rid of the main cast and replaced them with the talentless likes of Rhonda Rousey and some other unknowns.
People watch The Expendables for the amazing line up of action stars, big name badass's from our youth like Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Lundgren, and then there's Statham (England 🤘).
Jet Li was in the film for 3 minutes and doesn't even kick anyone!
I'm not really sure what they were thinking when they wrote the script other than (let's destroy this franchise)
Expendables was great.
Expendables 2 was better.
Expendables 3 was B-movie level writing and directing, oh yeah I forgot about the directing, all fight choreography became void when the director decided to shake the camera about and edit so only small snippets of action made it into the film, embarrassing, amateurish work.
4 out of 10 and that's generous."
" Cartoonish, but still fun
",2019-07-21 00:00:00,7,"The first is the best in this series, and I think the this one is second best. There isn't much story, but the action is good, and there are a few laughs. I wish they'd made these movies with the same people 20 years ago, but hey, at least they finally did. Antonio Bandaras is my favourite."
" Keeps getting bigger and better
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,9,"A saga that keeps getting bigger and better with each new installment. Personally, this is my favorite episode."
" Can't believe people pay to watch this...
",2019-06-22 00:00:00,2,"... but apparently they do, since Expendables movies get made.I like action films, mindless popcorn fun. But this isn't fun. It's ridiculous, not very clever and the action quickly gets boring and repetitive. It didn't even have any funny oneliners. Best one was Arnie saying ""get to da choppa"" but it was telegraphed a mile away so the moment was ruined.Avoid. Go see a John Wick movie instead."
" Good Movie
",2019-06-20 00:00:00,9,Another good movie...liked all 3 movies.Funny..Lots of stars and action.Some just don't get it.Sit down order a pizza and have a cold beer and enjoy the movie.Better yet watch all 3..
" Action, Action and Action
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,8,"This is the third instalment of Expendable franchise and stars an ensemble cast of Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Antonio Banderas, Jet Li, Wesley Snipes, Dolph Lundgreen, Randy Couture, Terry Crews, Mel Gibson, Arnold Schwarzenegger and above all Harrison Ford. As usual and as expected the movie lacks the script and few unnecessary exaggerated introduction of new cast. Action is on it's prime. Screenplay could've been better. Background score justifies the scene. Acting is good and credit should be given to the director to handle such a big and powerful star cast as everyone has got their screen share with perfection. Mel Gibson could've been utilised more and better. Overall a good action movie to watch"
" STALLONE HOGS ALL THE SCREEN TIME ONCE AGAIN
",2019-03-04 00:00:00,1,I'm a huge Stallone fan but i watch these movies to see every action star have their moment. Once again Sly hogs it all. Apart from that the movie is incredibly boring and no thought was put into the screenplay and the making of it. IMO the first was passable but its all down hill from there.
" Don't bother
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,1,"Will probably be remembered as the film that killed the franchise, there was a 2 year gap between each of the first 3, but 3 is now 5 years ago, a 4th is supposed to be in development but it looks doubtful. Characters like Rhonda Rousey who simply can't act doesn't help much, have never really understood the appeal of Jason Stratham he seems to be the same character in every movie he has ever been in. The only saving grace here is Mel Gibson who plays a good bad guy, and goes some way to resurrecting his career after some recent problems, Jet Li drops in for a couple of minutes and not really sure why Harrison Ford did this at all"
" Entertainment with lack of its best former self
",2019-02-09 00:00:00,7,"I loved the movie but expandables 3 is the Disneyland version of its former success. It was meant to be rated R but the studio made a horrible mistake making it pg13. Several scenes would have been way better had it been. The plot and locations where amazing classic cheesy action beautifully done. Mel Gibson gives us the role of a lifetime being the bad guy. Needless to say this movie requires some popcorn a beer and an open mind to get through it. Hopefully the upcoming sequel number 4 will go back to its rated R roots. The fight scenes played out well into each actor and qhat there known for.
Rhonda rousey judo
Sly stallone boxing
Antonio banderas played a character in this film that closely resembles that of the same one he did with stallone in assassins."
" Actually a fun film if you like non-stop unrealistic action
",2019-01-17 00:00:00,6,"Thought that No 2 was awful but No 3 was watchable, not least because they had some real actors like Banderas."
" An Entertaining Shoot-Em Up Movie
",2019-01-16 00:00:00,8,"16 August 2014. Sylvester Stallone has matured over the years and this movie offers up both a more nuanced performance combining both a lot of action along with some drama as well as the attempt at the transitioning from old to new and back to old again. It's sort of a redemption movie for the senior citizen (those over 50). I don't believe that this movie will be a great sell for those under 25 or if they do, that they will recommend it to their friends. This movie is somewhat like Sean Connery's performance in his last return as James Bond in Never Say Never Again (1983).Expendables 3 has some great wry references to getting old, and a surprise Spanish actor's comic performance against type that actually works. What doesn't quite gel is the interaction and balanced portrayal of old and new team members and there seems to be two too many characters on the good team to offer the more exciting details and character development to allow each actor their due. However, overall, this movie was very entertaining, with good pacing, and a nicely developed script that continues on and the movie does a decent attempt to offer the older actors some screen time rather than embarrassing cameos. The climax however wasn't the most original nor convincing nor do I expect another sequel unless this movie makes millions and millions.I did get my money's worth and a pleasant experience with many of our well known aging male action stars - that was this movies delightful sweet moments."
" Good for what you expect
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,4,"Before you watch this film, just think to yourself 'it's the worst film ever made'' in your head over and over...then think you would ''rather cut the words Justin Bieber into my arm'' then say out loud....''It's going to be worse than an Action Film made by the Kardashians...''-Then turn out all the lights and breathe for 5 minutes.Then this film will be better than you ever thought it could be.It's really not that bad if you are in the right frame of mind to ignore physics and just watch things blow up."
" Action Packed Thriller
",2018-12-13 00:00:00,10,Back again with another action packed thriller. This one filled with lots of popular actors has yet again thrilled audiences from all the scene by scene actions!
" The Expendables 3 (2014)
",2018-12-06 00:00:00,7,"Since I was a 90's kid I always liked old action films with the same old plot. It became a tradition of guilty pleasure and I kind of liked that style. All those Chuck Norris, Van Damme and Stallone seeing in different films was really awesome. But pulling a spin-off with all of them in a trilogy and finishing with more old and still young 80's and 90's stars is a great move. Though it had some issues like pre-released film in the internet it also pulled something in the box office.This film is for anyone who liked all the old action stars and there arrogance,style and most of all ""action"". It has been a satisfying trilogy and I personally loved it. No serious stuff. Just homage for the now-expendable actors. :-pOverall - 3.5/5"
" A very good and entertaining film
",2018-10-29 00:00:00,8,"A review written in 2014 by slightly mad 22 highlighted some points this reviewer agrees with. I have now seen all 3 expendable films on DVD. I am an older fan of many if not all the older cast members starting with both Sylvester and Jason. With Expendables 3 the failing of staying with a R rating did lessen the turnout with the fans. Mr. Stallone has publicly made his apologies. If there is a 4th installment I'm sure it will be R rated. However, for me there was enough blood.
The time spent with all the talent in this film and the previous 1 & 2 must be limited due to the time viewers will spend in their seats to watch. Also, in my opinion if more time is spent with the outstanding talent the story would take many turns in the plot. There is just so much time and money for that development.
To point out the best villain I agree is Mr. Gibson. Mr. Banderas gave a great uplifting performance. All the many others of the old cast are great always in their performance in this film and in all their other films. It would be great for a new viewer to spend a weekend and watch all 3. I am sure you would have an entertaining weekend, and that is the business of film making is for viewers to be entertained. I was! I recommend this film for those who like action packed films."
" A reboot is needed!
",2018-10-18 00:00:00,1,"I liked the first part and the idea, but this series needs a reboot badly.I won't talk about this one, but i will only say that I was plesantly surprised to see Mel Gibson. Now for the next part, a whole new cast is needed and a new perspective.First, throw away the newbies.At the begining of the movie Stallone must die in battle with an alien/demonic force.To combat this force a new team must be asembled.Christopher Lambert, master swordsman and demon hunter, Clancy Brown(The Kurgan, Horde Warchief-he is the one who kills Stallone, let's face it Stallone is no match for the Kurgan, Clancy is also an agent of a secret society working for an alien power, Justin Whalin- Christopher Lambert's apprentice, Jackie Chan-master racecar driver, Val Kilmer, master thief, Michael Dudikoff-ninjutsu master, Pierce Brosnan-retired secret agent investiganting the organisation, Mel Gibson and Dolph Lundgreen should also be in the cast.As sidekicks we should also have Bill Paxton-expert in unusual weather phonomenons and Matthew Broderick expert in mutated creatures! A womandshould also be helping the team, and get kidnapped at some pointI Scarlett Johansson would fit this role perfectly!
The leader of the new team should be none other that Snake Plissken! And it will be revealed that Stallone is not really dead, but turned into a cyborg, so the two titans can eventually clash at the end! Rambo vs Snake Plissken! The fight we all want to see for ages!
In the"
" not what The Expendables was made for
",2018-10-18 00:00:00,1,"The additions of younger talent killed this movie, most of it revolves around them and that's not what The Expendables was made for. We barely see the real crew of the 80's action heros and it's been toned down for some reason to PG-13. 
No thank you."
" """"Come on, we're late for a war.""
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,7,"I don't think it was a good idea to bring in a 'B' team to replace the original Expendables, even if some of the members delivered a different skill set. Thorn (Glen Powell) provided some electronics expertise and Antonio Banderas was a blast as Galgo, but after that, I'd rather have seen the mission handled by all the original players. If you think about it, Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) caved pretty easily on keeping his old buddies on board after all that fuss about going it alone with a new team. I didn't expect him to be wishy washy on that point, but if he hadn't, things might have gotten a little tiresome with all the new faces. Mel Gibson made for a pretty effective villain, but the attempts to out-scowl Stallone got pretty tedious after a while. I like the idea of big names like Harrison Ford and Kelsey Grammer showing up in the rotation to keep things interesting, which is part of the reason the newcomers didn't turn me on so much; I'd never heard of any of them except for Ronda Rousey, and only because of her martial arts background. Not to belabor the point, the gunfire and explosions are still part of the formula in this third installment of the Expendables series, but at this point, the franchise might actually be living up to it's name."
" It's time to hang up the beret, Sly.
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,4,"Really, the only good thing about The Expendables 3 is Mel Gibson. The rest of the movie is pretty boring, actually. Even the action sequences are too drawn-out and too choppy. But Gibson makes a fantastic villain and he was grossly underutilized so they could make more time for Sylvester Stallone's mumbling monologuing. Plus, seeing Stallone, Schwarzenegger and Ford look so old and out of place in an action movie made me sad. It's time to hang up the beret, Sly."
" Another action-packed Expendable
",2018-09-30 00:00:00,7,"As movies goes this might not be the most intellectual challenging one. Honestly, the story is really thin, just enough to get some kind of continuity between the action scenes. But then again, that what these movies is all about, isn't it? Full blown, over the top, incredibly implausible action. And it works, and it is fun. And as Barney (aka Sylvester Stallone) says; fun is important.Having grown up with all the action movies in the eighties and nineties, the Expendable movies is a nostalgia trip down memory lane. It is great that they have gotten all the old stars together - that they actually work together without anyone outshining anyone else. They might have gotten older, but they still know how to deliver those one-liners, to make the action work, and just keep the pace. And it is great fun (and I suspect they have great fun shooting these).Expendables 3 won't go down in history as one of those memorable films. But it delivers what it is supposed to. Two hours of solid action-packed fun."
" Great film for Action Film folks
",2018-09-05 00:00:00,9,"Great effort by the Stellar cast, all! The Critics are sometimes a pain in the posterior. I saw this when it first came out, now again today. It's better the second time. It's nearly non-stop action. Everyone did well, and I had a fun time viewing -- what more do you want?"
" Not as good as the second but better than the first. The best one in regards to acting and story.
",2018-08-30 00:00:00,7,"This movie gets a pretty bad rap but I personally enjoy it. These movies are meant to be fun, not Oscar winners. I don't think this movie is as good as the second film, but it's better than the first. However, this one is the best in regards to story (which isn't saying too much) and acting. With the additions of Wesley Snipes, Harrison Ford, and most especially Mel Gibson the quality of the acting improves. Wesley Snipes is really entertaining but unfortunately after awhile he is pushed to the side. Harrison Ford puts a lot more effort into his performance than Bruce Willis did and it pays off. Mel Gibson easily gives the best performance in the entire movie and I want to see him play more villains. He is a phenomenal actor and people need to forgive him for the mistakes he's made as a human being. We all have flaws. Kelsey Grammer is okay but he feels miscast in this role. He's not an action star. This role would have made more sense if it was played by someone like Nicolas Cage, John Travolta, Dwayne Johnson, Samuel L. Jackson, Denzel Washington, or Tom Cruise. Antonio Banderas is trying to play a version of Leo Getz from the Lethal Weapon films and it does not work. Ronda Rousey needs some acting classes if she is serious about acting. She has potential but she is not very good at all in this movie. Terry Crews and Jet Li are very underused in this movie. I know people complain about how this movie is rated PG-13 instead of R. I do think the movie could have benefited from an R rating but the action is still really good. I love seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger shooting from a helicopter with sunglasses and facial hair. He looks awesome. I also love the ending to this movie because it's awesome to see all these people hanging out in bar and having a good time after saving the day. This movie is not without it's problems but it I find it fun and it's cool seeing all these people in a movie together."
" Bloodless and boring.
",2018-06-21 00:00:00,1,"All the oh so grown up movie viewers, that say movies, dont need blood, to be good, are wrong. Especially, in the case of this, now, most likely dead franchise. It starts like the two first movies with a big actionscene. But there is no blood and it feels flat and boring. As does the rest of the movie. I saw the directors cut movie which is longer than the theatrical cut, but still no blood. This so called actionmovie has 50 minutes in the middle of the movie with no action. It has Kelsey Grammar, only known for playing Frasier. He has never been in an actionmovie before, so what the hell is he doing here?? Im guessing actual former actionheroes like Kurt Russell and Michael Biehn turned Sly down. So of course it makes ""perfect"" sense for Sly to turn to a tv actor who used to star in his own show that ended 14 years ago. Mel Gibson and Antonio Banderas are alot of fun. Hrrison Ford gives a solid performance, but like Wesley Snipes, he is wasted here. And the only laugh I had was Gunnar, saying that his mom, used to drive a tank back home in Sweden.All these extra stars, cant make up for a lackluster script and a a bloodless PG13 rating,And then there are the non-stars, The younger team, Barney assembles for no reason at all after firing his own team for no reason at all, One of them looks like a cgi character. I had to watch the opening scene of the second movie, just to remember what was fun about this franchise, It was the blood and guts and the energy among the cast when they still had fun making these movies. Avoid this. Pretend it doesnt excist. And enjoy the first two movies. The second being the best of them."
" THE EXPENDABLES MAY HAVE SOME ISSUES ---AND THEY ARE NOT EXPENDABLE BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS
",2018-05-29 00:00:00,9,"It has been absolutely clear that Sly Stallone is very talented and not a dumb boxer who gets lucky getting his face bashed in. Rambo talks in near baby-talk and sometimes all of them except the first two in each franchise WORK.
 I have not been excited to see a movie coming out in many years. Somehow I missed the Expendables as they came out-- THEN, I RETIRED. Though I fought it at first, my wasted back finally got me down. 
 I worked my way through college and retired as a recognized Addiction Specialist. In my young years-- I did not follow movies except for the ones that HAD to be seen in order to live in America.
 THE EXPENDABLES is so rough and tough and full of action that it seems to want to implode at times-- and it doesn NOT. Something saves the movie each time it starts to drag. 
 People moan at their stars AGING and it infuriates me! The men in these movies were and are ALL absolute ICONS. They are the Burt Lancasters, The John Waynes and the Eastwoods and NONE of those men except for Lancaster in THE PROFESSIONALS does a decent action film that has as much punch and as much weight as THE EXPENDABLES. These moves run FAST-- You have to watch or something will be missed--sadly sometimes it does not matter- AND this is entertaining stuff.
 These men have all given their lives to show business and they are mega millionaires. When I learned about the pay for these guys I smiled and thought-- Rocky, Lethal Weapon, Mr Universe/America, and I could go on and on.. These guys deliver just what men like to see. Men. Fighting men are needed in this dangerous world and every little boy dreams of becoming a tough guy. Many of these men were the best in sports that involve violence or tough challenges like body-building and competition. Even the Chick who is the bouncer (sorry could not find her name quickly) is a bad ass in real life and I read that she insisted on doing her own stunts. I remember when I learned that Steve McQueen actually rode the motorcycle in THE GREAT ESCAPE.. I was already a fan from THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN having him on that bike doing his thing was glorious. 
 I have to return to the age thing before I go. All of you people who make remarks about people aging-- God help you make it to old age. I can tell you that if you live-- YOU WILL GET OLD. It is one of the most frustrating things in life--eventual inevitable loss of youth and finally--for everyone, death. 
 I am SO glad that ALL of these guys got together and did this. I could watch a movie of them just standing around talking. They are our heroes and in these movies-- they remain heroes. The new faces in the movie are ESSENTIAL to bringing in new life and staying with reality. A force such as this in real life has newcomers.. a force such as this could never exist because of the physical demands and odds of dying too soon -- and new faces pop up each day in SEAL TEAM 1-1,000. New faces bring new interest, show others learning and give the old-timers a chance to teach the boys how to be men. That is one of the things that is missing is the TEACHING of their craft to the younger more inexperienced men. 
 An old western called TIN STAR shows the old Bounty Hunter teaching a young man how to be a good Sheriff and how to stay alive. It is in my top ten favorites-- it is the passing along of the secrets of the trade.
 I love these movies and love that each of these guys is showing that they have balls just to keep on doing what they do.
 Merle Haggard was a huge country Singer, Songwriter-- HE NEVER STOPPED. HE was told to do so by his doctor-- and 3 months before he died, his incredible voice was still there-- only a bit less perfect-- and that was forgiven in concert as his audience cheered his very minor mistakes or rough spots.
 He died along the highway just like he said he would in more than one song... I think these men will do the same and that is as it should be. I retired after 32 years of helping addicts. I worked hauling 240 40-pound bottles of water per day ( in the summer) and it paid the bills as I studied my craft and finally went to work helping to change the treatment field just a bit. I taught hundreds--thousands to be professional and to remember that addicts have a disease and should be treated with unconditional positive regard. THAT is what I will be remembered for and my patients will remember that I was THERE-- really THERE with them in the room.
 I think that is what we want in our entertainment--- we want it to steal us away from the perfectionism, lack of respect for those growing older, ( which is again the most ludicrous bias a human being without a fountain of youth can have) and the grind of living in a world that hurts, does not forgive easily and in the end--takes EVERYONE down.
 In a movie like (ALL of) THE EXPENDABLES, achieves that. We get to see superstars rubbing elbows and making it work. I will bet that NONE of these movies EVER flops at the box office. Wanna take that bet?

" The Expendables 3: I stand corrected, a bit
",2018-05-22 00:00:00,6,"Okay fine The Expendables franchise isn't a complete failure in my eyes, this is by far the best one and three movies in shows potential.First of all I want to address a point. I've long since complained about the state of a world where it's highest paid people are actors, singers and sports people. Though I'm a movie obsessive I'll never deny that they are offensively overpaid and Expendables 3 demonstrates that with the absence of Bruce Willis. They tried to get him back in a small capacity, just 4 days work and offered him 3 million. 3 million dollars for 4 days work! In response, he demanded 4 million and they decided to cut him loose. So think about this, a man being paid more for a days work than a minimum wage worker is likely to make in their entire life! That ladies and gentlemen is the world we live in.Anyway I digress.I wouldn't go as far as to say that The Expendables 3 entertained me but it certainly had its moments. The action was marginally better than the previous two films but it's saving grace was the cast. No I'm not talking about the same guys who have been phoning it in for the past two movies, I mean the newbies.
Antonio Banderas stole the movie, he was brilliant. Snipes delivered like I haven't seen him do so in years and despite all the criticism I think Rousey did a great job as well.So fine, it's not the big action blockbuster to end all action blockbusters but it blows the previous two movies out of the water. With a great villian, the new cast and a good lengthy finale it's passable stuff.The Good:As much as it pains me to say, Mel GibsonAntonio Banderas & Ronda RouseyThe Bad:Robert Davi was wastedStill mindless cliched stuffThings I Learnt From This Movie:Every person on the planet without any formal training can wield any type of firearm like a professionalThe moment Gibson was outed as a bigot, he started doing bad guy roles and nailed it every timeI genuinely want to know if it's possible to attain/maintain a physique like Stallones without steroidsCountless explosive shells fired from tanks at a building rigged with explosives won't set them offDisguising yourself as a bad guy complete with helmet without your allies knowing you're doing it in a full assault situation makes perfect sense"
" Time out
",2018-05-14 00:00:00,5,"Let's admit it , despite the amazing cast , The Expendables never gets out of the shadow of its weak plot"
" WOULD YOU LIKE TO HOLD MY GUN?
",2018-04-17 00:00:00,9,"The film opens with the usual impossible rescue scene. This time it is to rescue Wesley Snipes who will be known as Dr. Death. To his dismay they did so because they needed a fifth for a mission, one that fails. Stallone must go after Mel Gibson, who is not dead, really, but decides to retire his team because he fears for their life. Kelsey Grammer helps him recruit a new team, one that is more akin to an MIB force which includes Kellen Lutz, Ronda Rousey, and Victor Ortiz. Things go their formulaic way and the old guys plus the very talkative Antonio Banderas join the picture...again.Harrison Ford flew a helicopter like Hans Solo, Jet Li had a minor role that we can see expanding, and of course Arnold is back.The film is lengthy and spends time to quickly develop all the new players. The banter was not as good as the previous films, but was still acceptable. Banderas' character has ""Peter Sellers"" potential as a screw up who seems to luck into things.What best came out of this film was the potential for the next one.Parental Guide: 1-2 F-bombs. No sex or nudity."
" The Expendables 3 is the most expendable entry of the series.
",2018-03-31 00:00:00,4,"The first was a trip down 80s nostalgic lane, the second was an improvement and an entertaining action film in its own right. This third instalment has lost its grip on classic action films that charged its predecessors, so much so that even aficionados struggle to find enjoyment in this mindless mess. Barney is up against an adversary from the past, in which he decides to abandon his current team and recruit younger members in order to eliminate the enemy uprising. Aside from the predictable old versus young sub-plot, does the story sound familiar? Is that a resounding yes? Well, you would be right. The exact same narrative structure where the Expendables must defeat the disposable enemy mercenaries from creating global terror which then concludes with a short fist fight with the antagonist before they all grab a pint at the local bar and wait for all this to blow over...! Now, we have horrendous visual effects which include but not limited to: false explosions, disastrous demolitions, helicopter dogfights, Stallone's still face and...wait, that's not visually altered? Oh...anyway, the point is the quality of the acting, action and storytelling has lowered drastically. So low, that it comes across as tired and generically uninspired. Introducing new fresher faces to the team was a good idea, but their chemistry is nowhere near as dynamic as Statham and Lundgren. The cheesy banter was non-existent, it's only when the experienced players come onboard that the entertainment value heightens. Snipes taking a dig at himself for tax evasion, Schwarzenegger shouting ""get to da choppa!!!"" and Gibson being his usual crazy self, that is when the dialogue and characterisation strives for fun. Banderas was a welcomed addition however, it just wasn't enough to save this generic boring sequel. Mindless fun sure, but the worst in the series by far. Did 80s action films utilise horrific visual effects like these? No. Stop saving money and remain authentic! Otherwise this whole franchise will be expendable."
" Third Time Around A Tad Short
",2018-01-11 00:00:00,9,"I almost enjoyed this entry into The Expendables series as much as the first two but in some areas, I felt it fell a little short (but not much). This time around, Stallone introduces 4 younger members to his team as well the addition of Wesley Snipes (who paired up extremely well with Stallone and Sandra Bullock in ""Demolition Man""). Overall, I found it as action-packed and enjoyable as the first two but I found Mel Gibson to not be as convincing as the villain as Eric Roberts or Jean Claude Van Damm. Perhaps it's because we tend to associate him too much with the Martin Riggs character in ""Lethal Weapon' or William Wallace in ""Braveheart"". He just didn't seem to come across as the bad guy that well. 
Overall, it's a really good action film to just sit back and enjoy. I just wish Rutger Hauer or someone of that ilk had played the villain."
" bring the popcorn
",2018-01-11 00:00:00,7,"OK, it's not as dramatic as most of the movies the lead players would play, but it's a bit of fun and I quite enjoyed it. The first was, err sort of ok, the second was cringeworthy, but this was fun. Don't expect any suspenseful, dramatical stuff with a plot, this is just a fun action movie you can enjoy and laugh at."
" Mind-numbing, boring action sequences.
",2018-01-05 00:00:00,2,Thank god this is the last Expendables movie. This is easily the worst Expendables movie. I wanna die.
" Awesome, lived up to the prequels !
",2017-12-29 00:00:00,9,"I watched the two first movies, they were action-packed, adventure-blockbuster-ish type movies.. And this one ? it just lived up to them, lived up to the hype, and yes, I sat thru it enjoying the visual effects, the acting, the plot and most importantly the movie as a whole. I am a great fan of the trilogy.What a fine gathering of international stars ! 9/10"
" A good installment of the series
",2017-09-08 00:00:00,8,"After ditching his team as a result of a failed mission, Barney recruits a younger, hi-tech group which will help him get his revenge. Unfortunately, messing with the wrong people combined with the lack of experience will turn the whole operation upside down, leaving the ex-group to play the heroes and save the situation.It's a movie which brings together a huge group of celebrities, making every child's dream become true. To see together actors like Stallone, Ford or Gibson in the same picture is simply awesome, not to mention that there are much more very well-known figures. It's a movie which focuses its whole attention on the action part, the shooting, the explosions and the fast paced scenes, almost forgetting about everything else. Its story is mediocre at most, it's characters are simplistic and not very well outlined, sometimes even making questionable decisions, while its finale is highly predictable. Don't get me wrong, I didn't have high expectations regarding these but a bit more interest regarding them would have contributed a lot to the overall quality of the picture. It's great to see how a couple of people decimate a whole army but you can't create a truly great movie just with this kind of scenes."
" Awesomely Bad
",2017-08-28 00:00:00,5,"Manny's Movie Musings: ""The Expendables"" is awesome; ""The Expendables 3"" is awesomely bad. There are too many characters that are undeveloped, and so we don't care about most of them (the original members are sort of safe, as fans already have an attachment to them); the editing seems like it was done by a film student; it's rated PG-13 (so we get that corny, 1990s style James Bond violence); the action sequences are incoherent and so over the top that they can't be taken seriously, and therefore the audience has no emotional connection to them because you get the feeling that no Expendable will be killed off; and many characters doing things that make no sense. Oh, there is somewhat of a story here: The Expendables are hired to capture an arms dealer, things go bad, and many characters say lots of bad inside jokes that puts this movie into the comedy genre. Lots of wasted money and talent, and lots of disappointed 1980s/1990s action movie fans like me. My most memorable, movie moment of ""The Expendables 3"" is the scene when Mel Gibson (playing the lead bad guy) explains to Sylvester Stallone why Gibson became the way he is. It's the only well acted scene that gave this movie any real depth.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
" Forced PG-13 rating and adding young nobodies doesn't work
",2017-08-02 00:00:00,4,"I didn't think much of the first two Expendable movies but I was curious how the next installment of this movie would turn out. The 'PG-13' rating worried me but the addition of Wesley Snipes, Antonio Banderas and Harrison Ford to the team might make up for it.. right? In the opening scene of The Expendables 3 we see the old team (Stallone -> Barney, Lundgren -> Gunner, Statham -> Christmass, Couture -> Road and Crews -> Caesar) on a missions to rescue Doc (Snipes) from a train. Doc is happy to go home but learns from Barney that they're underway to another mission and just needed one more man for the job. Doc agrees however, and the team goes to Somalia to stop an arms dealer unloading some bombs. While the mission goes more or less to plan, Barney is shocked to see that the arms dealer is none other then Stonebanks (Mel Gibson) who he believed was dead. He opens fire on him and jeopardize the mission, forcing the team to withdraw. Stonebanks escapes in a helicopter and has the ability to take the whole team out with a rifle, but decides to only wound Ceasar and then drop a bomb on them which does no damage because they all jump in a river. Back home, a man known as Drummer (Ford), who has taken over from Church, and Trench (Schwarzenegger) push Barney to go back and take Stonebanks out. Barney doesn't want more of his friends to get hurt so he leaves them to go and meet Frasi.., I mean Bonaparte (Grammer) to find fresh blood (and Antonio Banderas) to get killed instead of his old buddies. But will the youngsters be tough enough to take Stonebanks down?While I thought that the second installment was getting better, the third one is a let down again. I don't mind the ridiculous over the top action that this movie is filled with and I like Gibson here, he actually plays a decent villain. There is also no shaky cam which is an improvement in my book. But where it goes wrong is the forced editing to make it PG-13. With so many knife fights, explosions, people flying around and gunfights, it takes a gazillion amount of fast cutting and patching to keep the violence down. And the movie suffers heavily from it, some action scenes are so badly cut it makes my eyes hurt! The other major downside is the inclusion of some random selection of young actors (I have never heard from) who are going to be the ""new"" team? Who thought that was a good idea? And who wanted to see the 'drama' happening when the old guys meet the young guys? I assumed that everyone who watches these movies want to see the old action heroes kicking ass, not some random kids riding around on motorcycles and hacking into security systems... The 'new' old members are decent though, but I'm not sure if Banderas character was a bit to much. The parody part of the movies is getting old as well, hearing Arny saying 'choppa' so often is getting old fast..The Expendables 3 has some decent action scenes and a good villain character but overall it suffers from the forced PG-13 rating and the inclusion of some random young actors that nobody wants to see."
" Expendables - meet the new blood
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,6,"After an action packed start Sly decides to retire his old Expendable crew and recruit some new blood for a deadly mission in Romania. Needless to say it all goes wrong and it's down to the old guys to come and save the day. As per usual our heroes are immune to bullets, have an unlimited supply of weapons and the plot is as predictable as what day it is tomorrow. But that's all part of the fun. We get a star studded cast though sadly Antonio Banderas still thinks that he's playing Puss in Boots. Probably the weakest of the first three movies but still good fun."
" You Have To ""Get It"" In Order To ""Get It""
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,7,"When examining a movie like ""Expendables 3"", one would do well to establish the ""ground rules"" first, so to speak. This franchise is not meant to be 100% serious. It is a throwback to the action stars and action movies of the 1980s, to be sure, but the tongue is always firmly planted in cheek. That being said, creator Sylvester Stallone takes these films just as seriously (in terms of trying to make them quality undertakings) as anything he has ever done. But, as my title of this review states, you have to ""get it"" in order to ""get it""!For a basic plot summary, ""Expendables 3"" sees the ""old gang"" of Stallone, Statham, Lundgren, Couture, and Crews still wreaking havoc on bad guys...at least in the beginning. After a mission involving the new baddie (Mel Gibson) goes awry, Stallone's character decides it is time to put the others out to pasture, recruiting a new crew consisting of Ronda Rousey, Kellan Lutz, Victor Ortiz, and Antonio Banderas. Along the way, they also pick up some help from Harrison Ford, Kelsey Grammar, Wesley Snipes, and Arnold Schwarzenegger.There are two primary reasons to watch the films in this franchise: 1. For the action; 2. For the comedy/camaraderie. The first part was really heavy on the action, while EX2 was pretty much all wise-cracking comedy. EX3, however, is easily the best made film of the series, featuring the best mix of everything. Though my personal favorite may still be part two (because I love the wise-cracking comedy a bit more than the guns a-blazin'), the film-evaluator portion of me realizes that this is the best overall effort so far.Of course, any Expendables film after the first one is going to be judged on the ""new blood"", and in that aspect EX3 comes through with flying colors. There are a few characters (Lutz, Ortiz) who just kind of fall flat, but otherwise all the other new additions are great. Banderas' frantic comedy nearly steals the show, while Ford, Grammar, and Snipes are perfect for this franchise (old guys getting a chance to mix it up again!). And Ronda Rousey?! Hoo-boy!!All the reviews circulating about EX3 seem to be overwhelmingly negative, but I can understand why, to an extent: if you can't see this type of film-making for what it is, you won't like the movie...simple as that. To be honest, these action-heavy flicks aren't necessarily my cup of tea either, but I can appreciate the diverse cast and the intent of what is trying to be done.Simply put, I was very entertained by this film in the theater (something I can't say for many of the films I've seen recently). While each Expendables movie offers something a little different (and thus will have differing levels of ""favorite-ism"" among fans), it was clear to me that this was the best-made of the bunch with its ability to have a good mix of humor and action spread out through the film."
" This should be rated ""R"", not rated PG-13!
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,1,"This is strong bloody macho movie and you need to rate this as ""PG-13"" to earn money in desperation? I know you need more money in order to get a bigger audience in desperation, unfortunately, you cannot lack too much safety along the way.There's such a serious situation that trying to earn money in desperation also results on not lacking safety along the way. so that means that this movie can still be rated ""R"", even if you need to earn money and get a bigger audience in desperation, but don't lack safety too much along the way at the same time!"
" Baby Expendables
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,5,"The addition of the baby expendables detracts from the movie. The pack of young actors can't act. Sly and his gang aren't great actors, but they don't try to be. The young group tries to act. Nope.It's new school vs old school. New school has a hacker. Yawn.The action is good, which is what's expected in the Expendables movies. The most annoying of the baby expendables is the MMA girl. She's the worst actor of the lot, so of course she gets the supposed character development scenes.The first two are better movies. They stick to the core group - the aging action stars. Let the kids have their movies for the Millennials."
