" Good Action Flick - Tense & Well-Paced
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,7,"Granted, the inside bank heist plot is implausible in 'Bastille Day' (retitled 'The Take' for its USA release), but the director James Watson paces the film so well with non-stop tense moments, and taps Idris Elba innate tension-building talents and ability to deliver quick dialogue (as he does with Sorkin's trademark banter in 'Molly's Game'), that one overlooks the spectacularly unrealistic story of the intended heist.This is a pure entertainment escapism - an action film that does not pretend to be more than it is.Therefore, I'm giving two thumbs up üëçüëç for a good fun-to-watch action flick. Grab a dish of popcorn and enjoy. Note my 7 Rating means it's good (like an 8 by most User standards).Richard Madden and Jose Garcia are well-casted.Is it just me that thinks Garcia looks and acts a lot like Harvey Kietel in his 30s?!"
" Taking Bastille
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,6,"How do I manage to stumble on two supremely generic movies back to back? Killing Them Softly followed by this? Ugh. So, Bastille Day (aka The Take) follows Elba's tough guy agent as he teams up with a super cocky pickpocket played by Madden. It's just such an obvious attempt to do like a buddy flick in the James Bond realm and it never works. Madden's character brings nothing to this and his performance feels so flat all the way through. Elba elevates things just because the man exudes gravitas and I now kinda wanna see him just list off the ingredients of things because that would be the most captivating thing on youtube that day.There's no reason to watch this beyond Elba though. If you're looking for more of his awesomeness and you've seen everything else? Go for it. Otherwise, this one is probably something to pass by."
" Great action movie idris elba kicked a$$
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,10,Finally a story that you can actually follow!! All the cast to a great job here especially Idris Elba. Kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.
" I've seen better acting in a 4th grade play
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,1,I don't know if the director wanted everyone to not act or not but it's horrible. I think they told Rob stark to do his worst John Snow impression. A total waste of time.
" Surprisingly Good, Entertaining, Worth Seeing
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,8,"This 1.5 hours Idris Elba movie was more delightful and enjoyable than the latest Kevin Costner (LHG) & Tom Hanks (NOTW) movies combined. Plus, it is a great inexpensive non-travel way to (re)visit Paris. üòä"
" Not bad
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,6,"This movie had a few things going for it, good acting and a fairly well developed storyline. The characters weren't particularly strong but some chemistry. The storyline had a few good twists."
" Refreshingly Raw and No-Nonsense Entertainment
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,9,"Considering there are no shortage of ridiculously unrealistic buddy cop and team-up style action & espionage movies in existence, this movie is refreshingly raw and gritty. That is, no over-the-top humor, very realistic fighting scenes, and a plot that could actually happen considering the current political climate.They definitely combine the themes of terrorism and corruption with a splash of espionage in this movie which wouldn't surprise me if this art is truly imitating life. Idris Elba's CIA operative character is competent but not perfect. He's not a clich√©d, overpowered Jason Bourne super agent who can speak six languages and win every fist and gun fight. And Elba's body language & swag (along with playing an espionage agent) basically makes this an indirect audition for him to take on the 007 mantle in the future.With the exception of Elba's character speaking to his CIA people and his two co-stars, the majority of the movie is in French with, of course, subtitles. Not sure why this is a complaint with other reviewers (the movie takes place in...wait for it...France). If you can read subtitles, you can follow the movie just fine.Bottom line, don't expect grand car chases, obligatory international breathtaking scenery, or some overcomplicated plot. If you can do without the excess movie-making flair, puns, and clich√©s of traditional espionage movies, you'll enjoy this flick."
" Ok but terrible ending. It's like they ran out of time & creativity
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,5,"Ok but terrible ending. It's like they ran out of time & creativity. Idris character was also flat, uninteresting and a jerk when they could have made him much more interesting."
" It just didn't have it
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,5,"The movie wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. The storyline was straight forward, the acting above average but the script was lacking. The fight sequences were a bit of a letdown."
" Good story, very good action, well worth watching.
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,7,"For some reason, I had not seen this movie when it was released but thanks to the recommendation from another movie enthusiast I got caught up. If you enjoyed the series McMafia, co-written then directed by James Watkins, you will like Watkins' work again. The producers managed to get a good cast, an interesting storyline and topped it with lots of action, none gratuitous, kind of like the first two Bourne movies.Early on, the movie wastes little time before plunging you in the action; you get a sense where this may be heading and can't wait to see how it develops. There's a scene that will really have you on the edge, perhaps even gasping and if you suffer from vertigo you will not forget it; I thought at the time that it was a dangerous thing to attempt, either that or the undetectable special effects were perfect. I sure hope they used stunt doubles, because... you'll see.
The Sean Briar character seemed tailor-made for Idris Elba, going by the several performances I've seen from this actor; either it was or Elba made the lead his own. From the first scene when Briar is introduced, you know he will be at odds with the rules, the protocols and what is expected of the almost rogue CIA agent, but you also know he's one to get the job done. Michael Mason is the second main character, played Richard Madden, from Games of Throne fame, and it's a character with a complex background and an even harder mission, if you can call it such, to complete. I would best describe it, without making it a spoiler, as being caught between a rock and a hard place. Some keen script writing, and you solved the problem of conveying Mason's character complexity, as you quickly figure out.Now some may be critical of how plausible the story develops, but it isn't anything we haven't seen some form of before; a little suspension of disbelief never hurt anyone, besides, it was necessary to go where it goes. I wondered about the budget for this production, for a second, then I didn't care anymore, I just enjoyed what I saw. There's comfort in tried and true formula 'good guys are the bad guys, and money, corruption, is the best vilain', which is what you'll get here. The ending begs for a sequel, I thought; I'd like to think this was intentional, but it ties it all up nicely, which I felt was unexpected given the mostly European cast, production and of course the venue I always like, Paris."
" Idris Elba starts off slow - gets a bit better later
",2020-10-15 00:00:00,5,"At the start he overplayed the ""tough guy"" and came across as fake. It's a decent action flick. Richard Madden is good and makes this movie better. Watch it for the action, not necessarily the acting."
" Cheap and Half-baked
",2020-10-12 00:00:00,2,"I very rarely wish to use absolutes or superlative language when judging works of art and entertainment, especially movies. This is because there is generally a silver lining or niche audience that each film seeks to target. However, 2016 spy-thriller wannabe The Take is simply the poorest attempt at recreating James Bond and Jason Bourne I have seen in the last 10 years.The Take stars Idris Elba (an Englishman) as a no-rules American CIA agent who operates with near absolute autonomy. Elba's character, Sean Briar, plays off like an insolent child more than a big-brained hero who knows better than his handlers. And this is no fault of Elba's. I blame lazy, pandering screenwriting that seeks to create a deep, moody character without offering more backstory than a 30-second bit of ""on the nose"" exposition where a coworker literally tells a colleague (and the audience) what Sean Briar is all about.The Take tris to find a modern take on spy thrillers. It incorporates a low-level pickpocket to make things more interesting. Still, the pickpocket's inclusion becomes more of a writer's convenience than a strong plot point. Additionally, The Take rather unrealistically attempts to recreate the effect social media has on protests and civil unrest, utilizing it like a quick side arm that can be fired and forgotten easily.This movie is not worth your time or energy. Nothing about it is genuinely new or exciting. Simply, it incorporates cheap characters to the extent that you will have 2 hours of background noise to fill your home while you scroll through your Facebook and Instagram feed."
" Good action flick
",2020-10-12 00:00:00,8,"It IS a foreign film. If you have issues with subtitles, just don't watch it. It's kind of like Die Hard meets Jason Boerne quality. Just put your settings on close captioning and you'll get it all....üòâ"
" Good movie
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,8,Lots of twists and turns but not too confusing. Good acting. Good videography. Worth the watch.
" Stared out pretty OK...
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,5,"I haven't ever seen a movie that had so much potential in the beginning and dropped off so fast as this one. It was almost like two different flicks. Sappy, sappy and sappy after about 1.25 hours. Yes, I watched it until the end because I kept hoping that it would get better. Kelly Rielly is a great actor so f you're going to pay her to show up to act, use her man."
" Idris excellence!!
",2020-10-05 00:00:00,10,4 years later I sincerely wish I could have given them kudos when it came out. Much action! Much suspense! Everything I could ask for.
" Utterly forgettable. Wasted opportunity
",2020-10-02 00:00:00,3,"Just what I said in the title. This was an utterly forgettable movie. I realized 10 minutes before the end of it but I did not remember the names of any of the characters whatsoever nor did I feel vested or interested in what happened to them. There was no backstory, there was no developments. I'm not even certain why this movie needed to be made. And I'm a huge Idris Elba fan. What a disappointment"
" Solid, Underrated Thriller with Elba
",2020-10-01 00:00:00,7,"""The Take"" is probably the best endorsement for Idris Elba as James Bond there could be.
Granted that I think more original black characters should be made available to black actors instead of inheriting white roles and properties, but you can really see why Elba has been tossed around, he carries himself with the same grit and confidence Bond, or a Bond-like character would have.The Take has a slick plot involving corrupt cops using fake terror attacks and exploiting mob mentality, outrage, and racial tensions as a way to cover up a massive heist. The idea of other forces manipulating the public based around police brutality is a very relevant idea, and this movie has aged well in that aspect.The cast is strong across the board, with Richard Madden and Charlotte LeBon rounding out the core crew, with all other performers both American, British, and French carrying their roles well.The pace of this movie is tight and clean, very few, if any scenes feel wasted. There aren't any frills or wasted time, everything is urgent, every scene more or less had meaning, and the action, both hand-to-hand (especially on Elba's part) and gun battles are all really well staged, with the shaky cam you see in the first few confrontations getting addressed and worked on later in the movie.The Take isn't perfect and wraps up with a nice bow and has some convenient action movie moments, however it's a very solid action-thriller that for the most part (except a few central to the plot) avoids big explosions and uses smart, technical action at a brisk pace that doesn't feel like 90 minutes. I would definitely recommend this if you're a fan of action in any way."
" Entertaining
",2020-09-30 00:00:00,6,"Decent plot. Elba's character is similar to him in Luther. I'm a big Elba fan and enjoyed his performance the most. Nothing groundbreaking, but overall entertaining and worth a watch if you're in the mood for a simple, fast-paced action flick."
" Entertaining and worth a watch
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,6,"Well paced action film with A decently interesting plot. Idris sticks to his Luther type in a good way. The ""bad guy's"" plan is somewhat original but otherwise nothing new which is why it is a 6 versus a 7. Definitely worth a watch and good way to spend an hour and half."
" Terrible Terrible Terrible
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,2,OMG so bad and preposterous. The plot is so lame and completely ridiculous. I really feel bad for Elba because he tried.
" RETURN OF LUTHER
",2020-09-28 00:00:00,6,"Great Action, stupid story
I second everything mumia-1 says
VERY topical, but writers were too lazy to bring disperse elements together in an intelligent and satisfying way. Who needs a cogent story if you've got enough fireworks to distract e'm to paraphrase our second lead here, from the script
Colorfully, genuinely, thrillingly portrays actual aspects of contemporary Parisian life, I know Paris well, and i felt like i was there watching this.
As for the fireworks, my favorites were the backseat brawl in the security van, and the chase across those steep French Mansard roofs, The rest were all exciting--fast-paced, expertly coreographed, well shot, fast cut,and edited, if not as original as my faves,"
" Descent action thriller.
",2020-09-27 00:00:00,6,"If you like movies of thriller genre, this one is surely worth a try. Good plot , fast paced story, good action sequence and performance especially of Idris Alba. I found end of plot revelation bit letdown but overall descent watch."
" Idris Elba shines in this movie
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,9,"How did this movie fall under the radar when it came out?
The action is really good and the plot nicely written.
It is a tense ride filled with twists. Idris absolutely shines! I would have loved a sequel to this."
" Watch it even if you only watch 7.0 and above
",2020-09-25 00:00:00,7,"Normally I only watch 7.0 and above but I was tired of scrolling and gave it a try.
Nice, undercover CIA movie with a decent amount of action."
" So far out there...
",2020-09-24 00:00:00,4,"I mean really? Really?Leave your brain behind when you start.Lot of action, not much of it very well choreographed."
" Impluasible but we're TAKEN
",2020-09-24 00:00:00,6,"I really hope the French cops aren't this dumb and the CIA desk jockey is not the kind of jerks working there. So many 'holes' in the script, lost count BUT it is an entertaining shoot-up. Watch if you got time to waste. Plus we tour Paris and I enjoy the French language."
" great story
",2020-09-23 00:00:00,8,Great flick. enjoyed rob stark lol subtitles help.
" Subtitles
",2020-09-22 00:00:00,3,"Probably decent if one speaks French fluently, as well as English. Half the dialogue is in French without subtitles. Bah Humbug!"
" No English subtitles--can't understand 1/2 the movie
",2020-09-22 00:00:00,2,"Don't waste your time if you don't speak French. 1/2 the movie is in French with no English subtitles. So, you have no idea what is really happening.I must say that for a movie of this caliber, this is a huge disappointment!"
" A cheesy mess
",2020-09-22 00:00:00,3,"First off they are forcing a relationship between Elba and madden that's clearly not there. So it makes it hard to find any humor or connection with the characters. No charm whatsoever. Also, what's with half the movies Dialogue not there? No subtitles? It was very predictable, no originality. Elba was the only good thing about this movie. Just a very poor attempt."
" Wasting time
",2020-09-22 00:00:00,1,Completely wasting my time. Boring and no Subtitle when they speak French.
" Don't listen to most of these reviews, this is a story of initial judgement and redemption
",2020-09-22 00:00:00,8,"Great movie. You might be inclined not to watch it because of all these reviews that state ""I DON'T SPEAK FRENCH, AND WITHOUT TRANSLATION I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT!"" But you absolutely do not need to understand the French dialogue in order to enjoy this movie! Use your best judgement on the French speaking scenes and you will be okay. Just roll with the punches. Idris Elba does a killer job at playing both good/bad cop. Richard Madden also brings his A game. Such an original storyline gives a great and thrilling movie! It also shines a light on how serious the pressure can be in certain religious groups, even if the main motive isn't religion, but just solely peer pressure from other people. All around, the character building and backstory for everyone involved is 10/10."
" Sounded good, what I understood that is.
",2020-09-22 00:00:00,1,"Movie seemed good, had a good cast, and decently plot. But half the movie is in French so you miss out on most of the dialog due to no subtitles. The English has subs, but none of the crucial French scenes are."
" I don't speak French, thank you.
",2020-09-22 00:00:00,7,"Good movie, but ALOT of French spoken and not translated/subtitled, so no idea what they're saying for long stretches."
" Great if you're English/French bilingual
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,5,"""The Take"" could have been really good. Or maybe it was. I wouldn't know. I don't speak French. One can make assumptions regarding a large chunk of the dialog that had no subtitles, but generally, as for me, I prefer to know for sure what's being said."
" Most of the subtitles for the French dialog are missing.
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,1,"Saw this on Netflix. My french is awful - so anytime the dialog switched to French, and the subtitles weren't visible, I was in the dark.Subtitle person - you had one job and you blew it."
" Inventive story, good action, better know French and English
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,6,"Acting was sound, action was uniquely good, cinematography was spot on, sets were perfect, script flowed well and characters developed well.My only complaint was there wasn't any subtitles for the French bad guys, though there was for the French good guys. This would've been better if the team added that part. I like subtitles to add to the international mix, though half done subtitles and not knowing what is going on is frustrating.Overall a good movie, and almost worthy of being recommended."
" Great movie
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,7,"Love the movie, couldn't give it 10 stars because they don't use captions for all the French being spoken. Not sure why they only give captions for a few of the french parts and there's a lot of French in the movie."
" I would love to watch this movie
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,6,"But a half or so is in French, with no English subtitles, or at least very inconsistent ones.
It might be good, Idris is always great, but I lost the plot because I don't know what half the people in the movie were saying. Shoddy production."
" I come you know French
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,8,"The subtitles for this film absolutely suck. Whenever the characters speak french, the translations only come up when they say basic, easily understood phrases. A large portion of this film is characters speaking in French, with the viewer having absolutely no clue what they are talking about... unless they speak French themselves.Other than that, I really enjoyed this film. I saw it shortly after it came out when I rented it through redbox, but my most recent viewing of it was just a few days ago, via netflix. I think both Idris Elba and Richard Madden are both believable in their roles. Idris plays a strong lawman who often goes with his intuition, which is often against his superiors' wishes. It's nothing new, but he excels in the role. Richard plays a good-hearted pickpocket who unwittingly plays a part in a terror attack. Despite being a criminal, he is out of his element throughout most of the film, and he comes off as a guy that's trying to clear his name and stay alive in the process.Again, both leads are very believable.My favourite parts to this film are whenever Richard's character is committing his acts of thievery, and there are several of these scenes. They always are different and very entertaining."
" Hope you know French...
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,5,"Ok action movie. The use of subtitles was very poor. A lot of dialog is in French and most of it was not sub titled which would have added with character narratives, maybe."
" Half the dialogue is in French, with no English subtitles
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,7,"Half the dialogue is in French, with no English subtitles. Once in a while there will be subtitles for one or two words of French dialogue, indicating that some made at least a small effort. Interestingly, watching this movie on Netflix, all the English dialogue had close captioned subtitles."
" Almost no French translations on Netflix
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,3,Some translation clown at Netflix thought it's a good idea to omit translating 90% of the French dialogs. What a joke!
" Language barrier
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,7,"I always use subtitles since I don't hear well.The spoken English was subtitled, which was helpful, but the long spoken exchanges between the French police/tactical/intelligence was spoken in French, but NONE of the French dialog WAS TRANSLATED and SUBTITLED.Maybe not a huge issue except that the 'good guys' had maybe ten pages of dialog between them. The French speakers provided about 80% of 'The Take's' total spoken word.Now, Idris Elba is the caliber of actor who doesn't need to chatter in order to get his thoughts out.Still, with the Strong, Silent Type in the lead, there was no way to follow the plot. When we thought we'd identified the villians, we had to watch and wait for another character's confirmation of events.I don't know who's responsible for subtitles...but really, our phones can transcribe a spoken voice message. We can speak to lock our doors, turn off our lights, and play our favorite music.#pleasefixsubtitles"
" One of the best chase sequences
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,8,Had a low expectation with this movie but I was surprise to the intensity and action in movie it's really good entertaining.
" Poor Captions.
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,6,"I speak English. This movie was made in English it says. That is the only language they offer us with hearing disabilities. I watched the movie with captions on with Netflix . When English was spoken the captions showed up just fine. However when the actors spoke in Italian there were NO captions at all. You'd expect a movie where about 1/2 the dialogue was in a language to have the transition captions built right into the movie for those of us who do not speak Italian. So the bottom line is that the movie was basically understandable in English for about 50% of the movie. I really think this would fall to the editing department. I could be wrong but NO awards for whatever department that fell flat on their faces and failed & spoiled the whole movie for EVERYONE who starred in, or had a hand a hand in making this film, right down to the viewers"
" No Subtitles!
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,3,"1/2 the movie was in French, yet no subtitles to know what was going on. Missed 1/2 the movie because of this."
" NO SUBTITLES! EERRGH!
",2020-09-19 00:00:00,1,Most of the dialogue is in French but THERE ARE NO SUBTITLES! Not that this cliche plot is very hard to follow but being able to understand the dialogue would be nice.
" Great action movie
",2020-09-19 00:00:00,8,Loved the foot race on the rooftops of paris. Would have given it 10 if the english subtitles were there for french conversations.
" Liked it with 1 negative
",2020-09-19 00:00:00,6,"I don't know french! I liked the movie but when it would go to scenes when they speaking french or whatever it is, i didn't know what they were saying and couldn't put subtitles to translate! So don't show them damn scenes cause I don't understand em lol would have rated better but the language"
" Need subtitles
",2020-09-18 00:00:00,5,I think it could have been better if they only put more English subtitles when everyone was speaking French. I loved all the action.
" A Solid Fun Robbery Movie To Watch
",2020-09-18 00:00:00,9,"09/18/2020 A fast moving bad cops/robbery/corruption movie who's principle characters are played out by fellow French actors Idris Elba, Richard Madden and Charlotte Le Bon. Definitely an enjoyable movie to watch. Watch for yourself and decide? Bon Appetit'"
" Netflix just doesnt have the skills
",2020-09-18 00:00:00,3,"The half movie is in French and Netflix still doesnt know how to implement subtitles when someone doesnt speak english. If you dont know French, then you wont understand half of the movie."
" Netflix failed the movie due to subtitles
",2020-09-18 00:00:00,6,"The use of subtitles is so inconsistent that it's rendered uselessLuckily the French movie follows nearly every American action movie, so it's not hard to followJust wish Netflix showed some effort when it splashed up on the main page as a new movie to watch.Rated a 6. But if I spoke French, I would have rated it higher"
" Meh
",2020-09-03 00:00:00,4,I love Idris Elba and Richard Madden but this is not a very good movie.
" Cracking movie
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,9,Grab a drink and some chips for a rollercoaster movie. Great performances. Good storyline and lots of action
" Action in the best standard of Snatch and Lock stock and two smoking barrels.
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,10,The best standard of Snatch and Lock stock and two smoking barre
" Movie ruining accents
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,5,"It's an ok, middle of the weekend no-brain action flick but my God what is going on with the accents? A medley of British actors with nothing but horriblly mangled American accents, even Idris Elba who fooled everyone in the Wire with his pinpoint Baltimore drawl just massacres the dialogue."
" A brilliant thriller!!
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,9,So I watched this movie on tv I absolutely love Richard Madden and Idris Elba. Was a brilliant thriller with plenty of twist and turns. The acting was superb and the storyline was really good. A good Saturday nite film to watch. The Take will keep you entertained all the way through with plenty of action from both actors. I really enjoyed it a must watch if you have not seen it.
" What happened to Zoe?
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,2,How so conveniently everyone uses Zoe and how conveniently she disappears at the end of the movie. Without her help the ending wouldn't have been possible and she disappears just In time for guys to celebrate their glory.
" Nutshell
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,6,Movie is out of story doesn't know how to end even with the creepy climax. Idris Elba totally wasted with such a talent . Too much predictable sequences. It's mix of too many movies corrupt police officers and bank robbery with some unnecessary elements to deviate us from the plot. Average movie
" Excellent!
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,10,I am scandalized! Why on earth does this good action movie have only 6.3 here!????? I really enjoyed it and highly recommend it to everyone!
" Not a Must see
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,6,I bought the dvd cause of one of the greatest actor I love: Richard Madden. He has already the potential to be the next James Bond. The story itself is a normal conspiracy story about a terror organization that I won't to spoil out further. There are some good shootings on Paris. Watch it if you like to see Idris Elba the other possible James Bond. Don't expect too much. The actual rating matches with mine and my wife 6/10.
" Good action flick
",2020-03-05 00:00:00,7,"Very good, action from start to finish.Edge of the seat action. Keeps you intrigued until the end. Recommend.The story is about corrupt police officers in France who use social media for their own gain to create a diversion for a bank robbery. Somehow (and conveniently) the CIA become involved and use an American civilian (pickpocket) in France who just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. They team up together and try and foil what is about to take place.Still reading?? Why haven't you watched it yet??"
" I'm a sucker for blow 'em up action flicks
",2020-02-16 00:00:00,8,"Well this is way cool. Pickpockets, fragile French maidens and tough as nails tall muscley black people with facial hair. The ability to run all over the roofs of Paris is worth seeing ... how do they do that? I like this type of movie and this is a particularly good example."
" 40 minutes of my life gone to waste
",2019-11-13 00:00:00,4,"Totally unbelievable plot and uninvolving characters. Actionwise, the film pulled all it's punches. Maybe it was targeted towards 14 year old teens or elderly people, who knows. I was fool enough to watch half of it."
" Mixed Bag But Descent and Entertaining Action Movie
",2019-10-19 00:00:00,6,"Action thriller i good it's not great, it's not perfect. ""Bastille Day"" is the work of good performances and interesting story but very predictable, i mean every twist is very predictable, It's not the worst film in the world, but it is painfully mediocre.
The action scenes is good not alot of long takes and the is not alot of shaky cam but alot of cuts unforchantly. As far as action films go, the raised expectations of the first half of the film arguably heighten the disappointment of the clich√©d finale."
" Captivating till the end
",2019-09-26 00:00:00,9,"Full of twists , fast paced and Richard madden in every scene. Perfect action thriller"
" Loved it!
",2019-08-28 00:00:00,8,I really liked this movie. It was exciting and action packed. Would highly recommend!!
" Idris Elba just made his audition tape for Bond!
",2019-08-20 00:00:00,7,I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It wasn't deep and it wasn't meant to be. The action was excellent. I especially liked when Idris' character stops Madden's character as he believes he has escaped the Marketplace on the motor bike. Idris stops him cold and that was just cool. I prefer Idris in Luther but I will take him any way I can watch him. I hope someone gives him a proper opportunity to show his skills. Always a joy when he is on the screen. I think he even performed the song at the end of the movie. I know he D.J.'s on the side. Do I know too much?
" Not bad at all
",2019-07-11 00:00:00,8,"Quite a mixed bag of reviews on this movie. But if you take it for what it is, an action thriller, then it is not bad at all.
Idris and all the cast are pretty convincing and Richard Maddens character is great, maybe worthy of a film in itself?
Charlotte Le Bon is also very good.
The story is interesting and I wanted to see how it would end and that was not disappointing.
My only criticism is that it contained too many unnecessary incidents of foul language. But I hate that in any movie."
" Don't waste your time, really...
",2019-07-10 00:00:00,2,"What a boring turkey this 'action' movie was, It's a wannabe action movie that Hollywood has done so many times before and so much better. 'But Oh!' my friend said, 'it's set in Paris so that's different'. Not it's not, if you're feeling for an action movie with a terrorist theme complete with the duped unwitting female helper rent out From Paris with Love. It has great action scenes, car chases and kick ass foot chases and great chemistry with Travolta as the cowboy reckless CIA agent. This turkey has Idris Elba who sure, was menacing and always looked locked and loaded in The Wire but that was American made. Here he's so wooden and stiff and well, British. The bro banter simply isn't there, just lame corny lines between 2 Americans in Paris or one american and one 'Black guy with an American accent' - yes, that line is actually said!
Ok, so if you're on the Cultural Studies tip, it's worth watching only to deconstruct that 'funny' line in context. Otherwise, rent From Paris with Love seriously."
" Wannabe action movie
",2019-05-20 00:00:00,3,Horrible acting. Idris trying to be a super cool cop. Everything is so contrived and unreal. Horrible screenplay. Ending is such a b grade action movie. Taking the federal bank as if it's a kindergarten bank.
" James Bond Warm-Up
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,7,"'The Take' feels like it has all the major trademarks of the 'Action-crime-drama', which is why it takes a good cast & crew to separate itself from cliches and predictability. The concept is great: an unlikely team-up, a pickpocket gets caught up in a terrorist plot and is forced to join up with a CIA agent. Pair Richard Madden and Idris Elba as the two characters and you have two people that can elevate pretty much anything they're in. The first half does a nice job of subverting your expectations, something the second & third act seem to forget about accomplishing. The reason for that being that the scope of the film continues to increase with each scene, thus losing the thrill of having this being a smaller-scale crime-thriller. At first it feels like the 2016 film 'Focus', then a little more like 'The Purge' franchise, perhaps throw in a little 'Fast & Furious', and you have 'The Take'. A good film in its own right, though, all I could think about was how much I would still love to see Elba & Madden play James Bond one day.7.1/10"

" I wanted to love this movie...
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,4,"... but it was just SO BAD. The ridiculous tropes and overacting, the ridiculously convoluted plot, and the illogical decisions made by the main characters made that impossible. What happened to Idris's accent from the wire? We know he's got it in him - but it wasn't here. Richard Madden... someone PLEASE get him a voice/dialect coach that is an actual American. One good thing - it IS watchable in the same kind of way that grey's anatomy is watchable. Suspension of disbelief and the recognition it is ridiculous. I gave it two stars because it is actually watchable and one more each for giving me a chance to drool over these two for 90 minutes."
" The rhythm is compact and there are not too many sensational or off-line segments.
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,5,"The rhythm is compact and there are not too many sensational or off-line segments. But the plot is not too innovative, the special effects are unsatisfactory, lack of attractive points."
" Idris is as effortlessly cool as ever. Bring on 007
",2019-02-09 00:00:00,8,"Really enjoyed this action thriller.
Great story, interesting characters and great action.
Proof if ever it were needed that Idris Elba is more than ready and capable of taking over the James Bond franchise.
Great screen presence. Super cool. Badass"
" Finally, A CIA/Crime Movie To Rave About - 100% Movie Perfection
",2019-02-04 00:00:00,10,"02/04/2019 Terrific movie where the CIA good guy not only looks the part, he's believable in every way, played by Idris Elba. Exceptional easy to follow storyline and even better actors/actresses. Great movie! Bon Appetit"
" Great movie for its genre. Funny and full of action
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,8,"Great movie for its genre. Plenty of humour and action without the bad CGI, ridiculous stunts, or corny unnecessary banter you find in some movies. Nice twist as well."
" Good enough action thriller, with a twist...
",2018-12-24 00:00:00,6,"Richard Madden plays a pickpocket who gets involved over his head when he steals the wrong packet. This is a great premise for an action thriller, but unfortunately Richard Madden doesn't pull it off as I had hoped. His acting is far too comical compared to Idris Elba's tough-as-nails persona, and the two characters doesn't gel that well together (for me, at least).The film has some great action sequences and very good visuals. It gets more interesting as the film progresses, as we learn there's much more here than meets the eye. The entire film is about a brilliant (inside) plan to rob a bank. This twist was completely unexpected, so the film definitely deserves more than one viewing to follow the leads.In the vein of 2005's 'Chaos' starring Jason Statham, this is an interesting heist/bank robbery action thriller."
" Need english subs for french scenes!
",2018-12-23 00:00:00,7,The movie itself was great. I liked the plot revolving police corruption. I watched the movie via netflix and struggled to understand the scenes with the actors speaking french other then that worth a watch.
" Richard Madden and Idris Elba
",2018-11-10 00:00:00,7,This hot mess is what you get when you put two A+ stars in a low budget movie with crap writing. I get the hint that there is a really good book out there somewhere. If you are not a Richard Madden fan then skip this movie and go read the book. Richard Madden did. This is why everyone loves him and he has people standing in line wanting to offer him scripts
" Pretty mediocre
",2018-11-05 00:00:00,4,"Starts of good but becomes really bad soon after. They should've made it an all french movie maybe it would've been better then, rather than have two main British actors doing an American accent which was sub-par by both. Worth watching if your bored"
" Le Bond
",2018-10-14 00:00:00,7,Michael Mason (Richard Madden) is an American pickpocket in Paris. Zoe (Charlotte Le Bon) is an anti-fascist who is recruited to place a bomb in an empty right wing party building. Sean Briar (Idris Elba) is a reckless CIA agent assigned to Paris. The three are pulled into a conspiracy to heighten the political atmosphere for a Die Hard scheme.This proves to me that Idris Elba could have been a great Bond. The story is a good convoluted thriller. The only thing missing is a truly fun buddy chemistry. Madden needs to be a little funnier to make the pairing better. I'm reminded of 48 Hrs or various other odd couples. This is not quite up to that level. It's not as fun but it's a solid thriller.
" Fairly exciting ...
",2018-09-06 00:00:00,4,"This is another one of those Hollywood lefty films. Accordingly, cops all over the world (in this case France) are either dirty or just plain stupid! Of course, there is always one rogue cop around, in this case, Idris Elba who fulfills the role quite adequately. It's an exciting film with the usual car and/or foot chases and the bad guys will certainly be done in. So now that I've seen it, I will get rid of my Blu-ray copy and hope I can find one more interesting."
" A Cheesy Action Movie
",2018-06-29 00:00:00,4,"A charming pickpocket, a CIA agent with unorthodox practices and a bunch of villains who can mysteriously infiltrate swat teams pretty much tell what the movie is all about. The one dimensional, dispassionate, taciturn antihero character initially looked funny with Arny starring in Terminator movies and alike. However, when others (Van Damme, Rock, etc.) started to mimic the same wooden acting style, they looked and became outright boring. In this cheesy action movie, the ""cool"", disinterested acting of Idris Elba evokes the same bad feelings. The plot is so predictable that the pace of the unfolding events always lags behind your guess. This is an action movie that I fell asleep in the last 20 min. or so. The only good thing about it is some nice Paris scenes in the background."
" The Take boasts a stellar cast but falters with a generic predictable plot.
",2018-05-29 00:00:00,5,"Originally titled 'Bastille Day', however due to a recent attack at the time of its release it was apt to rename this crime thriller. Regardless, changing the title cannot amend the noticeable flaws that hinder what could've been an exciting thrill ride. A thief, gifted with sleight of hand talents, steals a bag which happens to contain a bomb. Now on the run from governmental agencies, he teams up with an American agent to stop the real perpetrators. There is a political message hiding beneath the action, revolutionising against fascism. Riots spawn, security increase and Idris Elba running across rooftops as he protects the Parisian streets from terrorism. I think we can all learn from him in one way or another. But yes, revolutionary message aside this is simply just generic and unfortunately rather forgettable. Elba is a leading actor, we've seen his capabilities before and to some extent he is the main appeal here. The hand-to-hand choreography is well executed, although haphazardly edited occasionally, and does enhance the action required to elevate the story. Madden on the other hand is a beautiful creature, but that's not enough to redeem the monotony in his acting. Le Bon and Reilly were criminally underused, particularly the latter. The plot is easy enough to follow for the average viewer however doesn't exactly provide many thrills for those who have watched similar films before. And that's the main issue, its genericism doesn't differentiate itself above the rest making it quickly forgettable. One twist was well executed however the rest of the plot was predictable. On the flip side, it's a well structured narrative that makes its ninety minute runtime fly by. Even if the first and second acts are uninspired cat and mouse chases. Overall, The Take simply just takes up your time giving you limited thrills. Clean direction, serviceable acting and well executed action can't save a dull predictable plot. Oh, and stay for the credits song, our boy Elba is also musically talented!"
" If this is what stands for a 6/10 IMDB I'm raising my bar to nothing less than 7
",2018-05-08 00:00:00,4,"This is at best a 4/10 straight to TV movie so only watch if you have nothing else in mind. It's not deserving of its IMDB 6.3 score in the slightest and surely must have been manipulated or voted up by the Idris Elba fan club
At the half way mark you will question whether to stop the movie or see it through. 
The acting, plot and production all got significantly worse as the movie progressed and even the end credits are no respite from Idris Elba's terribleness as he offers an ear murdering croak of a spoken word song that to be fair does reward the viewer with confirmation that this is truly an awful movie. Idris you can do better than risk your career leading such a weak script with laughable dialogue and by a writer/director with so little experience which is largely from a few tv shows. 
If this is what now stands for a 6/10 from IMDB I'm raising my bar to never watching anything under a 7."
" The Take
",2018-03-17 00:00:00,4,"Michael Mason (Richard Madden) is an American pickpocket in Paris, thieving to make a living.A case he steals goes off as it contained a bomb. Now he is hunted by the French police and a CIA agent based in the city, Sean Briar (Idris Elba.)They uncover a conspiracy at play to blame Muslims for the bombing atrocities while anti fascist protesters campaign against police brutality.The Take is a routine but underwhelming thriller. There are a few twists that involve corrupt cops but Elba is wasted as the maverick CIA agent who is frankly a bit dull.The film also has too many British actors playing Americans, surely the producers could afford some genuine American actors!"
" Elba's Take.
",2018-02-28 00:00:00,5,"The plot itself was actually quite good, however the execution was generic and dry. The sound mixing was also pretty poor and the composition was dull and sapped away at the excitement the the action was meant to create.Elba's American accent was not polished at all... It was almost, lazy in fact, however his performance was above average and the fight sequences were okay to good.In terms of script, how did Elba's character know that the other CIA lady was killed? There was no way of him knowing. Nobody told him and he didn't have any opportunity to find out. It would've been one thing if he were speculating, but, he was 100% sure. Also, one of the officers that apprehended the Director towards the end of the movie, was one of the officers who were in on the plan, however, the Director doesn't rat him out, instead, he fully accepts defeat; why?Bastille Day/The Take isn't the worst Political Crime Thriller Action out there, however, it was sadly poorly executed, and for the most part, though somewhat entertaining, it did get kind of boring. Was this a paycheck movie for Elba? Sure felt like it. 5/10."
" American & Capitalist propaganda well displayed
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,5,"Alba is a great actor and often plays very well, his performance here was mediocre but still enjoyable. As an action movie it does indeed deliver on action, the story itself however...
..is something completely different. Not only does the story show off the ""amazing"" Americans by saving the corrupt and incompetent French from a possible terrorist attack in Paris, the story also portrays capitalist propaganda in quite a grasping and striking way. This propaganda enters in two steps: (1) the protesters are given quite some attention and keep being labeled as purely anti-fascist to show that they are indeed good guys, the moment they actually charge the police lines and break through is nearly euphoric; (2) then however enters the second step which pretty much annuls the former by showing us that we indeed may protest but the money that is accumulated by banks and the elite is not ours to take, we may not steal from them as it are their own 'rightful' assets. 
The French policemen have come to the desperate decision to take the money from the federal reserve as their group was failed by the administration after the loss of 2 team members during a previous operation. They wanted to get even as they felt undervalued and disrespected, now whose fault is that? 
We can be mad and we may be upset about the inequality or the insane amounts of accumulation over our own backs, but we better not dare to take it back. We may enter the lobby of a bank, shouting and protesting, the vault however is off-limits."
" That's a BIG phone...
",2017-12-01 00:00:00,4,"That's a BIG phone.He was gonna find her THAT quickly?! {DARK} Good thing he has a helmet on... {/DARK} Why doesn't he put his bag around his shoulder instead of swinging it around wildly while trying to balance? That door REALLY disappears.Wild white hair guy.Nice elector ""conversation"".Wild van party.For a pickpocket he is not very streetwise.Poor movie, but good audition tape for Idris as the next Bond."
" Badly crafted actioneer with a couple of good things in it
",2017-11-29 00:00:00,3,"Bastille Day, as it was originally titled for release, is so badly crafted it never reaches the status of a real action feature film. On the whole it is hardly worth more than direct-to-video stuff.Sure action scenes are well done and some plot twists are nice, but the result is just a rushed up series of action scenes and transition/exposition talk scenes. To me it looks like the director is good at shooting music videos or short clips but is totally at a loss with the idea of creating a real rhythm spanning 90 minutes or so.Idris Elba is underused, as usual in movies, so he is not able to bring much more life to that stubborn reckless character. The rest of the cast is OK, they also have very little to work on.Worst of all is the plot. Although some twists revealing part of it are good, in the end it only succeeds in being both nauseous and stupid. Bastille Day graduates here into the Z movie realm: just don't be fooled by the budget and competent cast, producers wanted a quickie and they got what they deserved with this stinking quickie."
" No. There's a lot more
",2017-09-27 00:00:00,10,"Michael Mason (Richard Madden) is an American living in Paris living off his ability to pick pockets. The film catches our attention with a nude woman (St√©phane Caillard) walking through a crowd as a distraction. However for Michael, things come abruptly to a halt when he swipes and discards what turns out to be a bomb. His fugitive days don't last long as he is apprehended by CIA agent Briar (Idris Elba) who operates ""way off the reservation."" Is is attempting to find a girl and a bomber. Meanwhile we know the bad guys are the French police who are blaming radical Islamic terrorists. They have a map of the inside of a bank. The streets are in turmoil.I enjoyed the film. It didn't need a big twist or mystery to keep me interested, the characters did that themselves, often engaging in dry humor. I would rate it on par with 'From Paris With Love."" Guide: Nudity. F-word. No sex."
" A xenophobic romp
",2017-08-21 00:00:00,7,"The action runs at full throttle throughout from Paris rooftop pursuit, a bomb, car chases, several full-on fights, to a bank robbery in the midst of a riot.The acting is solid, the dialogue not bad and the characters just a bit more than two dimensional. The story is quite convoluted but not too hard to follow, if a little predictable in places. Talking of predictable, the bullet-proof all-American hero single- handedly solving the world's problems is a tiresome theme. Why must Hollywood consistently portray the rest of the world as stupid, inept, racist and corrupt? Self-projection maybe?"
" locations are ridiculous...
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,7,"while the movie is fairly good and keeps your attention with non-stop action.... the location usage is ridiculous to anyone who has been to Paris... take for example the chase scene... first it starts at what appears to be around the 16th Arr, and then suddenly he jumps through a window and is now near les halles and hotel de ville.. and then when he runs though les halles and he exits and gets caught, he suddenly is kilometers away in the suburbs near mairie de lilas metro at a small covered outdoor market.. lol.... .. other are just as ridiculous... ..."
" Just action/adventure
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,3,"There isn't much of anything to this movie, other than a lot of fast action, with the usual ""collateral damage."" Idris Elba is an actual actor, but he has no material to act with here. So, for that matter, is Thierry Godard, one of the leads in the French TV series Un Village fran√ßais, but here he gets nothing at all.Every now and then there are allusions to current politics in French - the National Front, etc. - but they don't go anywhere, and are not explained.Not much is done with the Paris setting. No pleasant scenes in the Eiffel Tower restaurants, or along the banks of the Seine, etc.There is no point in summarizing the plot, such as it is, because it's not very interesting. Suffice it to say that, when all is said and done, this is actually about an impossible bank holdup.If you decide to watch this movie - and I can't imagine why you would - watch it late at night when your mind has shut down and doesn't catch all the holes in the plot."
" Really Bad
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,1,I wanted to see this for Idris Alba as he is a very fine actor and I really liked him in Luther. I quickly discovered that the script was the huge letdown in this nag. It is very poorly written and takes liberties that the audience is supposed to ignore of hopefully completely miss. The only other cast member I know is Kelly Reilly who does as good a job as possible given the crappy dialogue. Both Reilly and Alba are British but are asked to play Americans so have to put on American accents to supposedly be CIA agents. I still do not understand why there were Americans in this obvious French bank robbery picture. It served no purpose and they could just as easily have been British SAS or whatever is the latest acronym. Once again a picture getting made when it should not have.
" Don't think about it
",2017-05-07 00:00:00,4,"This is an action/adventure and police story but not a spy story. Any mystery to be solved is typical police investigation.This is probably a great movie for those that enjoy action/adventure movies and don't want to think about it too much.The movie is typical. The American CIA avoids working with the French police. The writers rely on that to give the movie more adventure. The French people are quick to follow the leader in protests, such that they are portrayed as not caring what it is that they are protesting. The French police are not shown doing much to solve the problem except go around beating people up."
" This is a good one!
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,7,"If you like Paris, as I do, the film looks great and gives you the travel bug. The plot was very good. I was surprised. CIA meets pickpocket, and of course, he picks the wrong pocket. I thought they developed the pickpocket's character well, not so much Idris' character, but it still worked. The action scenes are well done and the editing is not bad. Usually on the lower budget movies, editing or sound suffers. That is not the case here. A bigger budget this would have been a hit in America as well.7 stars."
" Take it or leave it
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,6,"I was trying to work in a 'Taken' pun somewhere, but, try as I might, 'The Take' isn't that much like Liam Neeson's 'Taken' saga to warrant its inclusion. If you want to know what 'The Take' is like then I'd describe it as one of those ‚Äì oh-what-do-you-call-them ‚Äì type films. In other words, those films that fall into that middle-of-the-road category that you watch because you kind of like them, but probably won't remember them in X amount of days.The only thing that makes it less forgettable than the rest is the ever-reliable Idris Elba who plays a CIA agent based in a European city (which I think was Paris, however it's been over a week since I watched the film, so details are already a little bit sketchy!). Anyway, a young thief (played by Richard Madden who was best-known for his 'Rob Stark' in 'Game of Thrones') accidentally steals a handbag containing a terrorist's bomb (see, kids? Crime doesn't pay!). So, when it goes off, all the authorities think it's him. Luckily Mr Elba can see the thief through the smoke and picks him up first, allowing the pair of them a little time to clear the thief's name, bring the real culprits to justice and also stop another attack on the capital. All in a day's work for Idris.So, expect the shoot-outs, expect the car chases and expect a reasonable amount of banter between the straight-laced Idris and the anti-hero Madden. I know I'm being a little flippant when I'm describing it, but it's a decent enough affair. It has everything you'll want from a thriller, with the possible exception of originality. It's nothing you haven't seen before (sometimes better, sometimes worse). The two leads play off each other well enough to at least make this worth a watch. How many times you'll want to watch it afterwards may be another matter.If you're a fan of either of the two main leads, or just can't get enough of those films that ‚Äì sort of ‚Äì feel a bit like the 'Bourne' franchise (i.e. chases across European cities pursued by rogue agents) then you may get more than most out of this flick. Otherwise, it's basically one of those 'rent-before-you-buy' type films. If it's on Netflix or Amazon Instant video ‚Äì it should fill a gap in your viewing schedule."
" Don't mess with the Elba
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,7,"And no I'm not talking about a river. The charisma and screen presence Idris Elba projects is amazing. He can throw shades, have a stare-down and just generally make you do things without saying much. If someone like this is on the hunt to get you ... well you better run fast. But this is not just a chase movie. This has unfortunately some roots in reality with its terrorist attack theme.This is something that is hard to stomach and might be too much for some to view, in light of things that did happen in Paris or anywhere else in the world for that matter. But if you can blend that out and just accept this as entertainment and a movie, you will get a suspenseful story, that is intriguing and decent enough to watch"
" Save your time
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,3,"Contrived. Boring. The French to English subtitle translations are heavily Americanized, French don't speak the way this movie shows because it was made to fit the audienceSome scenes where Idris is running or fighting it's easy to see as his interview fir a possible Bond role. The story is not cohesive, zero intrigue, poor acting, and an over attempt to play to current topics make this a disjointed story. It tries to compensate fir lack of substance by faster action and a handful of too-clever moments. There are hundreds of questions and very few answers. My best guess is the movie was made to showcase Elba. He is pitted against the French CIA or some similar agency with moderately witty dialog. The same story of the solo American who is better than the entire foreign department of spies. Skip the movies"
" As good as a Jason Bourne Movie
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,9,"Pick-pocket Michael Mason (Richard Madden) picks up a toy bear in a bag next to a sitting girl not knowing there is a bomb inside it and tosses it. It explodes killing 4-peoole. The gov't see his picture and tags him as a terrorist. This was supposed to be a diversion by bad guys to get almost a billion dollars in bit coins from the French National Bank. CIA agent Sean Briar (Idris Elba) discovers the real story and teams up with Mason to clear his name.This is as good as a Jason Bourne movie. There is a good chase scene in the beginning when Mason runs from Briar across tin roofs and they can be slippery. Hey, I had to hold on tightly to keep from slipping off the couch. Briar asks Mason why he was running if he is so innocent. Mason says, ""You were coming at me. Did you see yourself?"" Mason almost convinces Briar that he is truly innocent and is not a terrorist and Briar needs him to track down the girl with the bag to get to the rest of the gang. Mason says he never thought he would be working for the CIA and Briar says, "" Well you are now."" The banter between Mason and Briar is very good and more good lines can be heard. There are many twists and turns and some will surprise you or maybe not. Hey, I did get one right. (You were lucky this time) The rest of the movie has Mason, Briar and now Zoe (Charlotte Le Bron) - the girl with the bag - on the run from the bad guys. We do see a good vehicle chase scene. There is good suspense all around the tension really shows up at the shoot-out in the French bank. Over all this is a very good thriller and Idris Elba does a good job as a new action hero. Notables: Kelly Riley as Karen, Briar's CIA boss; Jose Garcia as Victor, French Intelligence Chief; and Thierry Godard as Rafi, the chief bad guy.We have a new super-hero running around now. Let's hope for sequels. (9/10)Violence; Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes."
" A fast pace action filled with chases and fighting with no sense of plot and direction
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,6,"The Take also known as Bastille Day is a cheap action film that showcases Idris Elba as the next action star in a movie with a decent direction and performances. This film had the potential of being better if they improved with the script, direction, and even having a thicker plot. The plot follows a pickpocketing Michael (Richard Madden), who steals from others on the streets of Paris. With his skill of distracting people and being unnoticed and skilled as a thief. He steals from a young lady Zoe (Charlotte Le Bon) handbag and walks away unnoticed. Only to be disappointed with a phone and a small teddy bear. He leaves the bag behind a trashcan. And the bag explodes creating chaos on the streets of Paris. CIA operative Sean (Idris Elba) is on the hunt for Michael before the Paris officials can take him in. With Michael on the run from the CIA and the police. He will need the help from Sean to clear out his name by finding Zoe and escaping from a group of bad guys that want to cause chaos. It is a decent action film that I thought it was better than expected. Idris Elba and Richard Madden teaming up as they try to put the pieces together of the bad guys motivation. The chemistry with the characters like Idris playing a guy that has secrets and is good at what he does with his job. Richard playing a lying thief, and gives a lie about what he wants to do with his life. Then, there is Zoe (Charlotte Le Bon) who is caught up with being forced to set the bomb in place but fails too because she does not want to hurt people. The film has plenty of chases and action sequences to make up for a disappointing plot. Idris Elba, Richard Madden, and Charlotte Le Bon are talented actors but being given with a decent script to work with. I also found the plot to be quite disappointing with using the idea of terrorism. A group of guys that want to place fear into the city by causing chaos and anarchy. Lets throw in a few corruptions with the law enforcement. As the movie progresses, the plot become less and less interesting as there motivations are revealed. With this type of movie on a short run time of an hour and thirty minutes. Its one of those things that you can watch if you really have nothing to see or pick it up as a rental. The movie could have been so much more with a smart direction, and better script."
" A movie that could have been generic but enough aspects just clicked and the movie became tense and exciting.
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,7,"""This is crazy. I don't work for the CIA."" Michael Mason (Madden) is an expert pick pocket that is working the streets of France. While sitting down counting his loot he notices a woman throw a large bag away. He walks to it and looks for cash. As he walks away the bag explodes and he is picked up as the only suspect for the bombing. Now Michael must work with the anti-terrorist force to try and figure out what happened and what will happen next. This is a very exciting, tense and entertaining movie. It keeps you guessing and really sets the tone right off with Michael being brought in. You are never really able to settle in and trust anyone. That detail adds something to the movie that is needed and helps you become more involved. Elba and Madden are great in their roles and their acting along with the little details it throws in really transforms this movie from just another ""let's stop terrorism"" movie into something that seems fresh. Overall, a movie that could have been generic but enough aspects just clicked and the movie became tense and exciting. I give this a high B."
" Poor, very poor
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,3,"I don't bash every bad movie I watch otherwise that would be a full time job. Just saw this one on Amazon Prime -would not have bothered otherwise- and it makes a good distraction when you are ironing your shirts, but not more. Action sequences are OK, not great, not bad. The rest is terrible, the scenario ridiculous, the characters very forgettable. Shame when you put together actors like Idris Elba, Kelly Reilly (Pot luck, the Russian dolls) and Charlotte Le Bon (the hundred foot journey). Jose Garcia lands another weird role after Tout schuss which is even worse. 3/10 just for the action. Come on Idris do something!"
" Entertaining thriller - and by the way Keep you valuables secure!!
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,8,"Idris Elba is a convincing action hero and suits this type of action role - realistic enough not too old serious enough but also with a sense of humor. Denzel has been looking tired and puffy, the Rock is too big to be realistic. He also has a good rapport with his costar Richard Madden of Game of Thrones. Richard looked not prince like enough for Cinderella but here he makes a likable enough rogue - a pickpocket who turns out to have a useful set of skills. If like me and many others you have been the subject of some theft in a European city you would know how successful these scum bag pickpockets can be. It's quite eye opening to see it in action on screen. Two good British actors playing Americans. Idris is a CIA agent after a pickpocket who inadvertently picks up a bomb.The timing of the movie with the constant terror in France and it's unfortunate original title Bastille Day may have caused some not to see this movie - but that would be a shame - it's one of the more entertaining action movies of recent years with novel action sequences and a solid story that comes together and doesn't have too many irritating twists and turns."
