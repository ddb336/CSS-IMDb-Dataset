" It might not be the best movie out there... but it holds a special place in our hearts.
",2021-04-06 00:00:00,8,"Now, ofc, we all know The Lego Movie. Earliest memories go back to 1st grade, kids in my class singing ""Everything is Awesome"" over and over again...The Lego Movie was a movie that certain people were judgemental towards, thinking it was going to be another one of those movies promoting their brand toys. Well, it wasn't. It was way more than that.The whole uniqueness of the story, the characters, the animation. It was something that, at that time, no one had really seen before.Knock it off with some funny jokes that even teens and adults can have a laugh at, it was a fun movie for everyone and anyone. I honestly cannot believe someone if they say that they hated The Lego Movie. It was a kid's film. Meant for little kids.You can't tell me that you hated a kid's film, that would just be ridiculous.Yeah, it's obvoius that The Lego Movie isn't the best movie out there. But it isn't the worst either...It's a decent (pretty-good) movie, I think we can all, at to the very least, agree on that."
" Awesome!
",2021-03-31 00:00:00,9,It's entertaining. It's funny. The ending is amazing.
" fun movie
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,8,When i saw the trailer i was like wow this is cool. So watched this and it was so fun and different.
" The Lego Movie
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,8,8/10 - this modern animated classic will keep kids and adults alike laughing and engaged
" VERY GOOD LEGO COMMERC... I MEAN MOVIE
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,9,"This has to be one of my favourite commercials i have ever seen in a cinema, it was a little long though."
" Was Made According to Instructions
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,10,"Movie was amazing. I love almostly all characters ( Especially Batman and Emmet. If you love Batman, too, you can watch Lego Batman ) . Those two plot were united as perfect, they complete each other.PS: I have tried to make my friends watch a lot. However, i could not succes. This is why i am writing this review. watch and fun:)"
" Everything is Awesome!
",2021-01-07 00:00:00,10,Super happy about this movie' it was better than Ninjago and The Lego Batman movie. I did not care for those as much. Much improvement!! Great job with all the special effects!
" Construction toys
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,8,Very funny and imaginative with great voice actors like chris pratt and Elizabeth banks.The lego animation was realistic looking and fun watching the different ways they use it.
" Fanciful and fun
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,10,"Fanciful and heart-felt, and there's plenty of humor. And hoo-boy, that twist!"
" Pretty good.
",2020-12-18 00:00:00,7,"Im glad that the whole film feels and moves like, a couple of kids playing around with toys at a table, metaphorically, quite literally."
" Disapointed
",2020-12-06 00:00:00,3,"Complete scenario taken from Matrix and placed into Lego advertisement. Action scenes are so fast and chaotic that i started getting headache from watching. There is nothing original just cliche after cliche. Ending is a bit on the ok side, will not spoil it why, but that is all i liked a bit in this 1 hour and 40 minutes of a total disappoitment."
" Exciting and hilarious
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,7,"This film is charming and a fun experience. Every character is personified and likable. The design of the characters, the narrative, and the universe are well-designed and cohesive. From the unbelievable animation, all-star cast, hilarious jokes, and incredibly emotional story, this is a great film that can be watched over and over again without getting bored."
" ""maybe that's just me daydreaming about how warner bros, and other corporations are building new generations of their enemies...""
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,8,"When I figured out I was enjoying everything I watched from a list of recommandation, I also figured I should no longer dismiss one I had previously thought of as a joke. I mean, who would have seriously thought the lego movie would have some content in it? I sure didn't. In a way, it's a plastic colored-brick version of the society of spectacles, with a starting plot that feels a lot like the rhetorics of ""the end of history"" of our corporate capitalist new world order, and in this movie, the end of history actually means just that, in the form of superglue about to seal together everything that is, according the the plans provided with the pieces and nothing else. There you got the ""end of history"", ""the society of spectacles"" (with an actual backstage area for the outlaws, who when captured have their ideas recuperated and recycled into plans""), and ""creative evolution"", presented as talking lego characters, fighting against the spectacular capitalism. Or maybe that's just me daydreaming about how warner bros, and other corporations are building new generations of their enemies..."
" perfect
",2020-10-12 00:00:00,9,"There was one sense that hans solo from star wars in that movie .
star wars is part disney it is disappointing to see disney characters in WB's movie."
" Childhood memories.
",2020-10-09 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie in the age of 9 and watched with my friend. We liked it. Story, score and the moments that are funny. A must-see film for Lego fans."
" Well done
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,8,"Great movie, in 30 years, this will be an absolute classic."
" My Favourite Movie Ever!
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,10,"I first watched The Lego Movie in February 2014, just one day after its initial release and it's been my favourite film ever since.One of my favourite aspects of The Lego Movie is its animation. While mimicking the popular stop motion style by utilising frame rates and depth of field, each frame is striking and colourful yet realistic. The characters have great designs and are perfectly detailed with every scratch, fingerprint or imperfection hinting at what is quite possibly one of the best twists in cinema.One element that I have really grew to love is Mark Mothersbaugh's score (especially in the third act).
Honestly, I couldn't imagine The Lego Movie without it. Each new location and idea is met with this compelling and magical score that doesn't feel like it's forcing anything on you.An element that seems often overlooked is The Lego Movie's social and political commentary throughout. I mean at the end of the day, it's a perfect satire of a dystopian and communist world to the point where it becomes almost Orwellian. An example of this is The Octan Corporation which is jokingly referred to as ruling the world. Emmet's complacency to stick to the instructions and pay for overpriced coffee makes him an unaware drone. The fact that Emmet's face is also referred to as generic shows how everyone in this contained universe is manufactured and less organic. Everything is Awesome also shows how we seem to be unfazed by similar, catchy songs that have no real meaning or purpose.Not a single joke doesn't land. The Lego Movie never slows down to let you take in its beauty. Instead it keeps moving from one idea to the next without giving you a chance to breathe. I've seen this film at least 10+ times and notice new references in each scene.LEGO as a company means a lot to me. There's something so fun to me about working on a project and then being able to display it forever. Not only that, but LEGO acts as one of the most creative toys. I've always had a passion for making short 'movies' and LEGO stop motion animation helped me find my footing. But my main love for this company comes from Phil Lord and Chris Miller.The Lego Movie manages to juggle hilarity, hidden messages of conformity, a fun and engaging story (which perfectly parodies the Chosen One clich√©) and a stellar plot twist. I know this may not be the greatest film ever made, but it will probably always be my favourite."
" I loved it
",2020-08-07 00:00:00,10,I loved this movie that's all I gotta say also how did big hero six get the best animated movie of the year Oscar for 2014 this movie should've got the Oscar
" Couldn't stay awake
",2020-07-01 00:00:00,4,I tried to watch this movie for two days but I kept falling asleep. I almost made it to the end but not quite. The characters were okay but the story was boring & failed to hold my attention.
" Excellent adventure
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,8,"The creators clearly had a big love for Lego. There is such great attention to detail here. The animation and style are amazing and everything feels real. The humour and characters were all top notch, and the story is surprisingly engaging. The only flaw is that the pace can be a bit too much sometimes and it can feel overwhelming."
" Good family movie
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,9,"This is a fun and clean movie to watch as a family. We were laughing along with our kids, and had a few good talking points from it too."
" Deeply disturbing
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,10,"Intense, dark, psychological thriller. Kept me awake for days afterwards. Horrifying, made me question everything I ever knew."
" Lego
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,10,I would totally recommend this movie to those who possess a keen interest in LEGO.
" Everything is awesome!
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,10,"If you think movies based off toys are a bad idea, (Transformers) this proves it wrong. I know it's only February, but I think I can easily say this is one of the best animated movies of 2014. And unlike the Lego video games, the characters actually speak. There's also a lot of cameos from other Lego figures, some of which are characters you might recognize. It's clear the filmmakers put a lot of thought and heart into this movie. The Lego Movie is a definite blockbuster. (Yeah that's right, I said blockbuster.) Exaggerated personalities of DC superheroes also make it a great film for those who are not Lego fans.
Grade: A+ 10/10 5/5 stars"
" Cov-19 watch-a-thon day 10 The LEGO Movie
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,10,"Let's get it over with we're half way done
The Ups
AMAZING plot
Fun Score
Great Casting
Great message
The Down's
There are no down's"
" Truly Incredible Film
",2020-02-21 00:00:00,9,"The LEGO movie does an excellent job of portraying how LEGO toys are used. You have people like Finn's dad who collect LEGO sets and have to follow the instructions perfectly, and are very serious about it. Then you have people like Finn who like to build their own things and don't follow the instructions. Master Builder is a term that is actually used by LEGO and it refers to people who make all of the instructions for the company's toys. Being captured by Lord Business is a metaphor for LEGO hiring people who grew up loving LEGO and then being taken in to the company. Lord Business represents a consumer/collector that always wants more sets to add to their collection. I think this was a very bold movie for LEGO to make, because it questions both the company and the community itself. I truly love this movie for so many reasons but mainly because it makes me appreciate what The LEGO Group has done."
" Everything is Awesome about this movie!
",2020-02-20 00:00:00,10,"I was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie was. No comment on the sequels, though.4/5. Can't get that damn ""awesome"" song out of my head."
" 9
",2020-02-08 00:00:00,9,"Well what I can say. I've watched it 5 years ago and it was really good. I liked it ,funny, interesting plot, attractive for kids and whole family."
" High concept and self aware film
",2020-01-26 00:00:00,10,"Right out of the gates, you know this animated film is self aware. The Lego designs are exactly like some from my childhood, and the characters interact with the world just like we would. On paper this might've sounded like another tiresome toy manufacturers attempt to target another medium, but that's definitely not the case. The filmmakers are the key here and they continue a successful streak of comedy films. Their humour is very sharp and they push this self aware nature through the storyline. Strong cast and vast supply of cameo voices throughout. Interesting film and deserved a sequel."
" Charlie Day and Will Arnett were wonderful
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,6,A little overrated from the hype. Charlie Day and Will Arnett were wonderful and made the entire movie.
" An instant animated classic
",2019-12-21 00:00:00,9,"I freaking love this movie. The script is one of the most clever, funny, and sharp I've ever heard. The animation and voice-acting are great.This movie feels like an instant classic, and is one of my all-time favorite animated movies."
" Cute, Adorable
",2019-12-14 00:00:00,10,"Cute, adorable heart-touching and funny. The characters are developed nicely. Animation is smooth."
" LEGO!
",2019-12-12 00:00:00,9,"This movie is such a home run to me and such a surprise at the same time. A whole movie. About LEGO. Who would have thought that it would amount to anything. Yet, thanks to Lord & Miller, what we get is a gorgeously animated, brilliantly written and hilariously voiced movie that is both absurd and smart, comical and heartwarming.There is a moment, a single moment near the end that is a little... Tricky. The kind of thing that strains the reality of the world we're in. Still that's so minor that it doesn't hurt the overall experience.This is 100% a recommend for children and adults alike."
" Worth clearly a 10, gave it a 7 nonetheless
",2019-12-07 00:00:00,7,"...and here's why: It's - I think - mostly intended to be a movie for children. My little one is 5 1/2 and watched it together with me. But, and here comes the big BUT: it's not ideal for a small child (which of course would be the ideal audience for LEGO).The movie has SO MUCH going on, it's - as a reviewer mentioned before - overwhelming. They've put so much stuff (besides love for detail) in this movie, it's just packed with stuff. And this is the sad thing, apart from the very high speed with which all is going down. Every joke is living for just about 1 or 2 seconds max. Way too much to process for a child - and even I as an adult and movie buff had difficulties taking it all in.Of course, not alle references and jokes are intendend for the children but their parents, but it's just all too much. Maybe they thought that they only will get this one chance for a movie and HAD to squeeze it all in... But they should have stretched it to two movies and toned the speed way more down. It would have meant more fun and especially more time to take the lovingly made details all in.And they are plentiful. Let alone the LEGO-made water in the sea, it's so well made and hilarious to look at. And nearly everything else is just plain awesomeness. It looks, as mentioned by another reviewer, like a brickfilm on a big budget - they made it look absolutely perfect.So sad that children below, let's say, 8 or 10 will have a hard time watching it.
Otherwise: hat tip to the makers, it's very nice.Of course, Will Ferrell is a big bonus :-)"
" Great fun and expertly crafted movie that entertains from beginning to end, and best of all it understands the mind of a child
",2019-12-07 00:00:00,8,"A brilliant ride from beginning to end with so many creative characters and an interesting story to tell, starring Chris Pratt as Emmet, he discovers he is ""The Special"" and that it's up to him to take on Lord Business played by Will Ferrel. He meets a cast of crazy interesting characters such as Wildstyle as well as Batman who really does make the movie even cooler than it needs to be. The animation is crazy detailed and really made to look like stop motion with moving lego pieces which is all extremely vibrant, lively and expressive.The song ""Everyting is Awesome"" is catchy and will stay stuck in your head for days after viewing. The humor is great and all the character are very smartly and sharply written and loaded with spark and personality. The whole movie is filled with personality and will leave you feeling satisfied and inspired from such a breath of fresh air in animation that will have you feeling awesome and making you want to play with your childhood legos all over again"
" Must watch
",2019-11-28 00:00:00,10,"This movie was so awesome, it follows the Lego minifigure Emmet after he becomes the chosen one by touching the piece of resistance."
" Perfect family movie that everyone (regardless the age) will love
",2019-11-04 00:00:00,9,"I had no excitement in seeing THE LEGO MOVIE. Mostly because in Italy it wasn't that known nor advertised when it came out 5 years ago. But one Sunday after lunch I catched it on TV and man I was amazed! I really loved it from beginning to end and I also appreciated the style of the movie.The movie begins with Emmett, a Lego construction worker (voiced by Chris Pratt) that has an ordinary life in the Lego universe. He is soon approached by Lucy and Vitruvius the prophet and they pester Emmett saying that he is the chosen one of the Lego people and the only one that could save them. In fact, there is danger in the air: President Business (voiced by Will Ferrell) wants to create the most powerful glue ever made because he wants to glue the entire Lego universe making it static. So it's up to Emmett, Lucy, Vitruvius and many other characters made in Legos (including Batman, C-3PO, Green Lantern, Han Solo and Superman just for naming a few) to stop President Business' evil plan.What I loved about this movie was its sense of style and CGI animation, with colors so vivid and fresh, like a Lego construction coming to life. All the actors do their best, and let me say it: with a voice cast that includes Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks, Morgan Freeman, Will Ferrell, Channing Tatum, Shaquille O'Neal as himself and even Liam Neeson, how can you go wrong? It was also a surprise the part where we see in the attic Ferrell and his son moving the Legos and changing the story just how they wanted to change it. And the songs are very cute.If you never saw this movie before and you happen to catch it on TV, watch it! It's one of those rare family movies of these days that manages to delight and entertain properly both children and adults."
" The Lego Movie
",2019-10-02 00:00:00,6,This movie just seems to throw all the cliches together on a pedestal and make fun of them. I like it.
" this is GOOOOD
",2019-08-01 00:00:00,10,My mom says it is great AND NINJAGO BULLY KAI AND ZANE
" Excellent: 9.5
",2019-07-28 00:00:00,9,"Who doesn't love Legos? For more than a century, kids and adults alike have been transforming these humble blocks into whatever they can imagine, from X-Wings to The Tower of Babel. And while these toys have been transmuted into art, literature, and video games, they had not yet been depicted in film (at least, not theatrically). Well, their time has come at last, and the result is a wildly imaginative and thoughtful film, with all-star voice talent and breathtaking animation. Making excellent use of the various Lego product lines (this is probably the only time you'll see Han Solo and Batman in the same movie), The Lego Move tells a charming tale of how to turn the ordinary into the extraordinary, all the while providing slapstick gags and in-jokes to hilarious effect. This film's major flaws are those that are common among animated features: its silliness can get excessive at times, and some gags are used too many times to retain their comedic value. But overall, this is a wonderful movie, and one truly made for all ages."
" Good but only to a point
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,6,"This animated feature follows an ordinary-living construction worker who is accidentally pulled into a group of people that includes superheroes. Their goal is to stop the evil President Business from destroying the world. The animation takes place in a massive Lego construct.The early part of the film has a clever pace though it seems to depend too much on cartoon violent slapstick for cheap laughs. While there are better humourous moments elsewhere in the film, it seems to miss opportunities to satirize our modern world. It seems to get close to doing so but then stops short.One such example is the rightly named character President Business. He is so mean-spirited, narrow-minded, vicious, and bullying that he could easily have been modeled after certain political leaders of today. There were missed chances to show how such a character is destroying Earth's environment. Instead, the film seems more to follow a far-out science-fiction fantasy premise.I know I'm of the dissenting opinions here as the film is very popular with high critical acclaim. Still, I could only like ""The Lego Movie"" to a point. In any case, I did appreciate its message that ""ordinary"" people might be smarter than what most people would think."
" my notes
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,7,Very funny and extremely creative movie with a respectable story. unique idea with lots of clever ways to use different characters. some very memorable parts too (2 viewings)
" Pure brilliance!
",2019-06-21 00:00:00,10,"When this film came out in 2014, I was not a Lego fan, and I thought to myself ""Why on earth would anybody watch a film about Lego? What has the world come to?""
But, a few years on, and I was heavily obsessed with Lego, and so I decided to buy the DVD of The Lego Movie to see just what I'd missed. And, my God, it was incredible!
It was immersive and witty, hilarious and genius, and no doubt one of the best films I have ever seen! The plot is creative and engaging, and the graphics are incredible, right down to every tiny scratch and fingerprint on the Lego minifigures that add that touch of realism.
If you've not seen this film, then get on eBay and buy the DVD! It'll be the best purchase of your life!"
" Do not make the mistake in putting this one down before you see it.
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,9,"A fantastic animation with a wonderful touch. There have been some incredible family movies over the years and more recently disneys 'Frozen' however going into this with low expectations, they were blown out of the water. What a great movie for everyone to enjoy, its high tempo for the whole thing with a clever and imaginative storyline. After finding success in the gaming industry recently the LEGO has reinvented itself with this movie. Its colourful, funny and more importantly...creative. Do not make the mistake in putting this one down before you see it."
" A funny and Fantacy Movie
",2019-05-18 00:00:00,10,This movie show many thing of life.Like the love of family love of friend or other people that you love. So every one can be a speacail person you have only to belive that you are the speacail one and you will see that you are the speacail one in the world.
" Tops your expectations.
",2019-04-25 00:00:00,9,"I didn't want to watch this movie, I did because one of my friends insisted on it! After only 3 minutes, I was hooked!
It's not a simple childish animation, although very bright and shiny which will be the snack for your eyes. However, there are clear mature messages in the movie; rather political and social.
Of course it's a masterpiece made with legos and an incredible amount of hard work has been put into making it. I loved the new ideas they have maintained in the movie and the characters are just lovely. Don't make any mistakes. I'm not saying ""you could learn a lot from the characters' actions because they are so realistic and connecting"", but they have a lot to offer.
Voiceover for his movie is just brilliant, the blind guy who is basically a prophet/god figure is Morgan Freeman; isn't he that character already?
And, compliments to all the other voices; significantly, Mr. Will Arnet and Will Farrel! Amazing!
Now, you have to understand this is still an animation, so if you're not into it, it might not be interesting.
Also, how cool is that Lonely Island was nominated for an Oscar because of ""everything is awesome"" soundtrack?If you still don't know lonely Island, do yourself a favor, put their names on google and let the amusement and surprise commence!All in all, definitely recommend this."
" It's a full moon out tonight, party people here just feel alright, the place is packed and the mood is right, now have a good time y'all.
",2019-04-23 00:00:00,4,"The Lego Movie works as a premise, with quality dialogue and visuals, but doesn't go anywhere story-wise and overstays its welcome in the third act.A star-studded ensemble, the standouts being Pratt as Emmett, Banks as Lucy and especially Arnett as Batman. With many good moments, though targeting a younger audience than myself unfortunately. I find a lot of it to hold true of the real world, people having the same opinion of no opinion and doing and liking what everyone else does. Which I simply cannot abide.Superman: I super hate you."
" Everything is Awesome
",2019-04-13 00:00:00,7,"Everything is Awesome.
The animation is awesome.
The dialogues are funny awesome.
The story is beyond expectation & awesome.
The entire set up is awesome.
Everything is Awesome."
" Everything is awesome!
",2019-04-07 00:00:00,10,"""The Lego Movie"" is an unexpected masterpiece. An amazing visual style, breathing life into real LEGO blocks makes it a feat of modern animated movies. Add to that a constant hilarious script with jokes flying at you every 2 seconds, a creative story and fun characters and you got one of the most original animated movies in the last two decades."
" A good way to market
",2019-04-04 00:00:00,6,"It's all business.Kids will love this movie.Its too childish so as a movie lover,i couldn't enjoy.Anyway i respect the content which was made to a type of audience"
" I thought this movie was going to be an advertisement, but it's a masterpiece!
",2019-03-22 00:00:00,10,"I actually thought that was going to be an hour and a half long Toy commercial, but it's a true masterpiece! I love this movie! I love unikitty! I LOVE BENNY! Oh my gosh! This movie is the reason that nobody can use the excuse ""it's just a toy commercial"" ever again! It has a great message that anyone can be special and uses the oldest kind of story telling, the hero's journey, in an artistic & beautiful way. However, this movie managed to tell a timeless story using a simple storyline. And that's one of the biggest reasons why this movie should have been nominated for the Oscar's best animated feature, instead of Boxtrolls!"
" okay I guess
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,5,Not the worst movie. But there are better movie kind overrated. There is good acting this movie. It is kind funny at time. I think if it was less of a moral story it would have been better. But still it is a good movie to see. It you like like family movies you should see this.
" An animated classic that no one was expecting
",2019-03-12 00:00:00,10,"After hearing and seeing about this movie, I was very torn. I thought that this was going to be the sellout film of the year that's filled to the brim with product placements galore. At the same time, though, I was optimistic that this would turn out to be better than expected. And right I was, because this film just might be one of the best animated films I've seen so far. The animation is phenomenal, the story is very well written and very creative with it's subject matter, the overall flow is great, the voice cast were all very good, the characters are all memorable, most, if not all of the jokes landed very well, and the overall quality of this film is quite staggering. This is essentially the verbatim opposite of what I, along a lot of other people were expecting, because this film actually doesn't have that much, if any product placements whatsoever. Instead, it uses the legos and the characters in the films world in various fun, cute, and hilarious ways that are all executed very well. Mix all of that with the aforementioned great story (won't reveal to avoid spoilers), and what you've got here is an amazing animated film that is, indeed, awesome, and very much so. I recommend anyone who hasn't seen it yet to go do so, as this is all great fun that is well written, well animated, well executed, and just, overall, well made, making this an animated classic that no one was expecting. Do yourself a favor, and check this out."
" Awesome!
",2019-03-12 00:00:00,9,This movie made me buy some Legos myself lol. Awesome story and action. They can make anything into anything which can keep this movie unpredictable whenever they wanted to. Villain was the best and overall was totally satisfied with the end. Pass the Popcorn!!!
" Brilliant
",2019-02-28 00:00:00,9,This film is a visual masterpiece. The comedy is hilarious. This film has so much heart. This is a movie that can make ANYBODIES day AWESOME.
" Heartfelt and entertaining
",2019-02-28 00:00:00,9,Phil Lord and Chris Miller are geniuses I bet Disney regrets dropping them from Solo
" great movie
",2019-02-22 00:00:00,8,I like the lego movie because the story is good. The lego constructions in the movie is also unique and creative
" Lego my Lego
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,10,"Animation, acting, voice work, story was a nice fun adventure.For a first I am very please with what we got. The characters can be obnixous yet they are all different in their own ways.Its a fresh movie."
" Great movie to watch one time
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,7,"So first of all I liked this movie a lot with my first watch. It's funny, pretty wicked and has a more serious ending. The strength of this movie is eventually it's plot. The movie starts light heartedly and seems like very innocent movie. The first time watch is great so I wan't to discuss about the plot here so spoilers incoming.But before the major plot I want to tell about the things that aren't so great in my opinion. I was some what disappointed when I learned that this movie was CGI animated. It's no a huge problem because it does look good but I still have a problem with the overall look of the movie. It's not necessarily the CGI itself but editing and the speed of everything. There is too much happening on the screen for the most of the time. I think these great looking animations and effects are wasted because most of them last just like 2 seconds. There is not enough time to appreciate what you see on the screen and most of the time there is also too much stuff on the screen at the same time. It looks and is very cool that basically all the things are made of Lego, like water is transparent blue little parts, the sea is made out of Lego and smoke is made out of grey bricks. But on some action scenes there are like hundred different projectile parts on the screen flying around and the screen is just full of stuff and explosions. Then these different camera angles are on for just 2 or less seconds and action is essentially just too fast little moments.Characters are just little too shallow in my opinion. The Hero is supposed to be this no one like in so many movies, that's ok. But supporting cast has some minor problems. The love interest is ok but it's little bit too hasty with her decisions. I know she is meant to be very fiery personality but some things don't make sense. First she is very dubious about the chosen one. But still she doesn't take the attitude to just drag him with her and do things by herself. Instead she still expects him to do things even though she doesn't believe in him at all. I think her character would be more convincing if she just told him to sit around and say ""let me handle this"". That would make it better when the chosen one finally starts to fulfill it's destiny.Plot is great with it's mysterious connections to the ""real"" world and the lego universe. But after the first watch it's not a mystery anymore and that lowers it's rewatch value some what. I really like how the movie shows how child's imagination differs from the systematic and serious attitude towards playing with Lego and it's heart warming when this is discovered by the dad."
" Annoying
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,5,The song everything is awesome is everywhere and the film is for kids not for me the plot is very simple and even a bird can understand
" Brilliant !
",2019-02-15 00:00:00,6,"Wow ! This one was truly a wow movie, loved each and every scene , the concept itself was super unique and I loved it"
" Fast Pace and Wonderful
",2019-02-13 00:00:00,8,The LEGO Movie has been receiving lots of traction lately because of its newly released sequel (as of 2019). I feel the film has 1 main selling of points other LEGO films didn't. It is it has achieved an incredible feat by making it look and feel like it did when you were a kid playing with LEGO's . 8/10
" Wow quickest movie I've turned off
",2019-02-12 00:00:00,1,"I could imagine this movie would be very fascinating if you was tripping like mad on drugs, very hard to watch.Starts off with a Lego figurine bouncing from one end of the screen to the other (which made me very dizzy)coming up with what I could only imagine was an attempt at humour with a stupid song playing 'everything is awesome'.No It wasn't awesome, not even close.Turned off after 10 minute, wouldn't recommend movie."
" One of my favorites
",2019-02-12 00:00:00,10,"I admit I've been a Lego addict most of my life, but this movie is objectively great. Amazing animation, elite voice cast, great humor, and nonstop action. Plenty to love regardless your age."
" Everything is awesome!
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,9,Everything is literally awesome!!! Everything is cool when your party with me everything is cool when were part of a team!
" The original and still the best!!!
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,10,"When this movie came out five years ago, it shocked Hollywood with a record breaking opening weekend, which has been surpassed by other movies. Everyone loved it and thought it was awesome, and it spawned numerous theatrical spinoffs and a sequel, which is underperforming at the box office as the kids who grew up watching the movie are now in their teenage years enjoying black panthers and deadpool and netflix and chill."
" I liked it before it was cool.
",2019-02-08 00:00:00,9,"I mean, it's just great. 'The Lego Movie (2014)' is a smart, unexpected and, frankly, hilarious animation that's actually much more than the sum of its parts - not to mention being much, much better than pretty much anyone anticipated, especially considering that it's essentially an extended advert of sorts (perhaps the best, most product-aware advert I've ever seen). The hit-rate of its humour is incredibly high. It's genuinely funny on more than one occasion, providing several big belly-laughs. Even when it isn't 'laugh-out-loud', there's something amusing or clever that keeps an ear-to-ear smile on your face, essentially, every few seconds. The piece is also remarkably heartfelt. It manages to keenly deliver a few important and considered messages, round off all its core characters in satisfying ways and conflate its masterful but somewhat 'out there' twist with its already established world, all while delivering a fast-paced, mile-a-minute, almost visually-psychedelic adventure. Seriously, there's a moment near the end that comes really close to making me tear up. That's not bad for a picture about talking plastic bricks. Speaking of which, the animation itself is stunning. Everything is made of individual digital Lego pieces, most of which have fingerprints and scratches on them. This, combined with the stop-motion style and dedication to only using replicas of real-world pieces (there's no cheating here), makes for an impressively tangible but delightfully playful feast-for-the-eyes, one that packs so much stuff into each and every plausibly (if nigh on impossibly) real-life recreatable frame. It's just great. It's easily one of the best animated features that I've ever seen. If one were to be cynical and say it were just an extended advert and not a proper film, then I'd fire back and say that, as I mentioned, it's straight-up the best advert I've ever seen, by a wide margin, that's better than a lot of 'proper', non product-placement containing pictures. It's an advert that I'd be happy to watch again and again. Well played, Lord and Miller. Well played, indeed. 9/10"
" Not interested in a sequel
",2019-02-07 00:00:00,6,"If you were a Lego builder, you might like the imaginative take on your own imaginative endeavours. If you are a pop culture junkie, you will like the wide variety of characterizations. If you are a movie fan, you won't be disappointed by this cast and their voice work. I think the movie deserves props for its CGI, creative visual imagination, pop culture characterizations and voice work. But I felt they overreached trying to turn ""You Are Special"" into a transformative moral and I found the cutesy factor wore thin as the movie dragged on. I watched this in preparation for its sequel, which opens later today, to see if it would be worth seeing in a theatre. It fell a little flat for me and there was nothing there to interest me in a sequel. I give this film a 6 (fair) out of 10. {Adventure Animation}"
" 3 words to describe this movie....
",2019-02-06 00:00:00,10,EVERYTHING IS AWSOME! This movie is one of the best animated movies out there in the 20th century! Worth a watch if you haven't see it
" Whaaat!?
",2019-02-03 00:00:00,1,"I have started watching this movie. I could not watch it. No, really I could not. My brain was all about what am I watching at. Nothing is moving but their facial expressions and voices are to reveal what is going on. Everything else is static, not movable.I mean, are you joking with me? What kind of music or additional script can compensate for that? It is indeed just some kid moving the figures around and talking to himself of what is happening? If that was actually done that way, without even facial expressions it would be better, on TV, for kids, 2 years old 5 minutes segment.This is not a movie in any technical sense. There is nothing to like or dislike for me. There is nothing to watch. They say Gandalf was there. Where? One of figurine was Gandalf? Which one? You see, you have to tell me which one.The major problem is actually a camera work. I mean everything is too big and then suddenly you have to pay attention to a face, one face moving which is just one small part of the screen. There is nothing that points to that particular face, but the surrounding is static and big.As an experiment, fine, ok, funny, but no more than 5 minutes. A feature movie. No.The trouble for me is, if this movie has this high rating, what am I going to watch in the future? Nothing. As all people will start liking poop like this one, and I will have to watch ""oldies"" forever.What is the next movie then? La Linea, full 120 minutes feature. But that cannot work. These kind of cartoons are 5 minutes long for a reason.As I said this is not a movie, but if somebody was actually able to parse it to 5 minutes segments, maybe it would work then. It does not work for me, except watching a very small portion of on YouTube. Once."
" Everything is not awesome
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,4,There were some brilliant jokes in this film but overall the film falls a bit flat
" What can I say?
",2019-01-29 00:00:00,10,"Everything is Awesome? Everything in the movie is Awesome? The Lego Movie is Awesome. There we go. This is easily one of my favourite animated films of all time and one of my favourite movies in general. It's not only what I think to be Phil Lord and Christopher Miller's second best film (second to Spider-Verse) but there's just something about it that is so sweetly and charmingly nostalgic about it to me, not just the fact that it's Lego (although that is a main reason why this film resonates with me and many others). Maybe it's the outstanding animation, the self-aware and clever humour, or the messages about Lego and different builders being unique, or maybe just all of them together. But most of all, this film just makes me happy. There is never a dull moment in this film and it definitely deserves every single bit of praise it has gotten over the years."
" The worst Lego film I've ever seen.
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,1,Most of the lego films I have seen are clever and witty. This was just plane lazy.
" Unique and Creative!
",2019-01-04 00:00:00,9,"Amazing humor, great animation, superb storytelling. Even some OK emotional moments. Overall this is a safe, exciting, and fun film."
" Expected a basic kids movie and was pleasantly surprised
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,9,Kids will love it but the writing and layered humor will also please most adults. Very well done!
" AWESOME!!
",2018-12-08 00:00:00,10,"Those people who probably rated this movie low, probably has mental disorders"
" A lego product based movie
",2018-12-01 00:00:00,10,"This a fantastic movie with great animation and characters that are likeable. Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks and all the others the song is annoying though."
" Creative and entertaining
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,9,"This movie surprised me, it wasn't just a way to sell toys for kids. I grew up playing with legos so obviously I was looking forward to this movie. The voice acting/characters were great and the animation was probably even better."
" A Lego version of Toy Story, in a good way
",2018-11-21 00:00:00,8,"When i saw the ads for this one i didn't care much and didn't think it will live up to the hype easily. So i left it to the shelf for some time but recently decided to watch it. And i am happy i did since it's a fun and enjoyable movie after all.You got a protagonist that is ordinary in every way, like the most ordinary person you can find! So he is pretty relatable for most people. Everyone will probably like the fact that they would find some element they enjoy in the movie since it's a mashup of things and anyone could be a fan of most of them. You got heroes, nostalgic toys from your childhood and realistic everyday life in the form of a boy's struggle to play with his dads collectibles.The movie includes some solid action, decent comedy and a variety of characters voiced by great actors that fit the part. It reminds me a lot of Toy Story but this time the toys live their life in a way of spiritual form instead of moving in the real world, with some small exceptions of course. It comes down to a kid's fantasy and his wish to play with his toys and maybe find a playing partner in his serious dad.The representation of everyone involved and the plot unfolded nicely and i think the Legos are a very nice watch and delivers solid fun to its audience. 8/10"
" Ha ha Hilarious!
",2018-11-07 00:00:00,10,"To me, Victoria Claudette Ramos, this movie was... hysterical! I loved two scenes: ""Honey? Where Are My Pants?"" and ""We have come from the planet Duplo and we are gonna destroy you!"" Those parts were hilarious! The scene I vote the funniest... drumroll please... ""We have come from the planet Duplo and we are gonna destroy you!"" That scene caught me rolling on the floor laughing!"
" I misjudged this movie. It has everything to be awesome!
",2018-10-12 00:00:00,10,"I never expected a movie about living blocks of plastic to be this good. It has lots of comedic splendour pouring out at a fast pace, a solid plot with many unpredictable twists and turns and last but not least a really heart-warming message for everyone watching. An all out enjoyable flick for anyone who needs cheering up."
" Happy to be along for the ride
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,8,"The Lego Movie is entertaining. Only about three of every six jokes land, but at least they're swinging for the fences. My kids were completely engaged in this movie, and I was happy to be along for the ride. The voice acting is well done and the animation is clever. This film could have easily turned into a commercial for Legos, but it didn't, thankfully. I would definitely watch this movie again."
" The Lego film that needed to happen
",2018-10-01 00:00:00,10,"Now, I know this film has its annoying spots and very child oriented areas, but when it comes to Lego films of the past, this film is leagues ahead. Lego films in the past either weren't professionally made, or when they were made, the Lego bricks themselves would behave and act in ways that they can't in real life due to their physical mechanics. In past films, mini fig's would move in ways that would bend and melt the plastic, or have human like faces that would scare the crap out of you. Also bricks and mini fig's would be combined with real life environments. So for example you'd have Lego Anakin Skywalker and Obi-wan Kenobi in a cantina, but the cantina looks like it does in the film, not done in Lego. In The Lego Movie however, you can look at just about any scene or area, and you can create that with Lego in real life. For the most part as well, the physical mechancis of Lego are respected in this film too. In addition to the life like movement, with how good the animation was, your first time watching this film you have to ask yourself if its animated or actual stop motion. The animation is THAT detailed. As you go through and watch it, you'll find subtle things like fingerprints or scratches on mini figs, printing on bricks, even mold numbers on certain pieces. This attention to detail is what makes the Lego movie the Lego movie that everyone has wanted for so long."
" Everything Isn't Awesome!
",2018-09-20 00:00:00,10,"The movie itself was great, from the computer animation to the voice acting to the actors who portrayed real-life people. However, with that being said, the film could've done without so many songs. It almost felt like watching a Disney-esque musical. Chris Pratt voicing Emmet was the highlight of the cast, aside from the live action version of Will Ferrell. The story was not the worst you'll see, fairly entertaining. And the new characters alongside the known characters was fun too, a good mix.Other than that, it might get annoying to continuously hear the song, Everything is Awesome! Still a great film."
" Stands alone as a great movie
",2018-09-13 00:00:00,9,"One of my favorite movies ever. Surprising that a movie like this would be so great. You'd think it'd be an hour and a half of ads but it's not. It's got a solid script with good jokes all the way through, great animation, and likable characters."
" Lego Movie
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,7,"A fast moving movie both joke and action wise, which needs a second viewing to catch all those jokes.
A host star names do the voices with Chris Pratt as the likeable Emmett,plus an irresistible theme tune 'Everything Is Awesome '."
" One of my favorites!
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,9,"There are few things that I dislike about this movie. I'll just get the only big one out of the way immediatly: the real world framing device. I already don't like framing devices as a whole, particularly when it implies that the story we actually care about isn't really happening in-universe. This one in particular also contains both the worst writing and the worst acting in the movie, and like most framing devices really isn't really necessary. The only thing I liked about it was the Duplo joke at the end. That being said, everything else about the movie was great! The characters were lovable, the jokes were hilarious, I love the conflict between being creative and having a strict plan with neither one being stated as better than the other, the animation is AMAZING, and the idea that ""The Special"" is not Emmet, but actually it's anyone who wants to be was great! Certainly a 9-10/10 if not for the framing device and a few other small things, but still one of my all-time favorite movies!"
" Awesome!
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,10,"Basically everything about this movie has has been said in the other reviews, so I'll confine mine to two points: 1) The realization that this movie is so good BECAUSE it can be mistaken as one big LEGO advert was a fascinating one to me. They found one extremely satisfying way to make ""the"" LEGO movie and tell a beautiful story (watch until the end!). Had they done something like ""G.I. Joe"", ""Battleship"" or the likes, they would have failed. 2) The way they're using LEGO bricks for EVERYTHING, including and not limited to fire, water, foam, smoke, explosions, laser beams, LED bargraphs, clouds, force fields, motion blur (!) and more, is just mind-boggling and alone warrants watching the film. Everything is awesome!"
" Almost perfect
",2018-06-26 00:00:00,9,"This movie is successful in more ways than one.The soundtrack and score is awesome, the plot is awesome... EVERYTHING IS AWESOME!!!It's obviously an hour-and-a-half long commercial for LEGOs, but it tries EXTREMELY hard to mask the fact.Emmett (the main character) is a LEGO figure trying to fit in, but everyone ignores him. Y'know... the whole ""golden rule"" thing.The rest of the plot... you're gonna have to find out through watching the film.Trust me, it's good!!"
" I don't get how people say this is just one giant commercial!
",2018-06-20 00:00:00,9,"I absolutely loved this movie. The voice acting was amazing, the animation was great, and the jokes never fell flat! But the one thing that perplexes is me is how people can hate it so much. It's not just one giant commercial! If you want a giant commercial look towards the emoji movie, but not this film! Not once in the movie do they say how great LEGO is! There isn't much product placement in it at all!
People also say that nothing important happens because it was all in the mind of a child? Did you even watch the movie? Will Ferrel's character learns to imbrace his inner kid and creativeness!
There is also a great deal of symbolism in the film that adds to it greatly.
I can't wait for the second part!
All in all go watch this movie, unless you're a stubborn, butt hurt man that hates the toy and movie industry."
" Great for all ages
",2018-06-16 00:00:00,9,"A lot of movies can learn from this. It's smart, it's funny, it's surprising, it's emotional at times and the animation is original (characters move and look like actual lego pieces). It has a vision about being special that I don't often see and not only about that. I loved the villain's weapon and the McGuffin, I loved and understood all the characters (especially Unikitty), I loved the jokes. Half of the twists are unexpected while having a story easy to follow.
I can't give it a 10 though because it has a boring scene towards the end. It's not long, but it can make the perspective about the entire film confusing. Also the movie didn't took great risks, it's a pretty standard story, even with the twists and parts of originality.
Definetly worth a watch and still a very good movie despite my nitpicking."
" A really good and funny story
",2018-06-07 00:00:00,8,"I fall in love with Lego since I saw the movie. I became a Lego fan.And wish a better performance they are giving to me in the second part. I am looking forward to it.(Ps. I am a fan of Batman too,so it made me excited to see his funny face .)"
" The lego movie (2014)
",2018-05-07 00:00:00,8,"Incredibly creative, well written, memorable, with a great depth and meaning behind it, helping this film become truly great. One of the best movies of 2014, and one of the best animated movies since Wall-E."
" More than a cheap cash grab
",2018-05-07 00:00:00,8,"In 2013, everyone thought that this movie was gonna suck. A cheap cash grab to increase Lego's sales. Another dumb, bland kids movie, like Frozen and Despicable me. Boy, we were wrong."
" Lego movie review
",2018-05-07 00:00:00,8,"One of the best animated movies since Wall-E. The animation and lighting is spectacular, the cinematography is awesome, the characters are extremely well written and the movie is just very entertaining and well paced."
" Lego eyecandy, that is just too childish to get into
",2018-04-18 00:00:00,6,"I watched this movie in 2014 with my uncle in 2014 for my 19th birthday. Weird right? Well that's besides the point. I thought I was going to get a really cool epic awesome movie for kids based off a fun toy with a punch. Too bad there is no punch part. Let's get into why this is the 3rd most overrated animated film of all time. -STORY-
The story of Lego Star Wars would have worked on paper. It has the set up. A world built. It's basically about a little Lego man who is too normal for his own good. So one day a Deus Ex Machina in female Lego form comes from the heavens to save the red pilled Legoman and whisk him off to become a hero. A somebody. Meanwhile, the evil President Business or whatever is plotting an evil attack to make the world normal or conformist or something by gluing all the character's feet down on Taco Tuesday. Now the protagonist must save the world by getting a team of unlikely heroes straight out of the Wizard of Oz. But not because they are pop culture references made to sell more Lego toys after the movie is over. They basically save the world by being creative. The challenge here is that Steve is anything but creative. Which is funny. That is basically the only funny part for anyone over the age of 11 because the rest of the story seams to not have very funny jokes. The story basically has the characters win by default. After all if I forgot to tell you, this is a chosen one story which is a dumb cliche and is probably written ironically, (just like every piece of dialogue in this film) The conflict between President Business and Steve boil down to daddy issues. I'm not even joking that the resolution happens to be that the real life son has a dead beat dad played by the hilarious HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH FUnny manchild Will Ferrell who has his own creation of Legoland or Legotopia or whatever. The dad turns out to be president Beezwax and wants to glue down the world for perfection. But the two realize they can be creative together. None of the things could be explained in this film other than Legos. No science. Just pop culture references. Honestly, if I watched it the second time. Maybe I'd truly love it. Because as of now I don't. I'm sorry but this movie has a mediocre story. Almost any Pixar movie is better. 5/10-CHARACTERS-
Steve is a character that is nice but too Mickey Mouse for his own good. He is blah. So he must transform and know the truth. Now which of the 2 things do you think he does? That's right he learns the truth. But he does like I said become more creative even though any other character could do better. Wyldestyle- She is cool, probably the best character. She is a hot goth chick Lego. Batman- The film's sweetheart. But really he isn't even that funny. He's actually trying to hard to be childish that it isn't funny by pointing out the tropes of what Batman does best. I hate the cynical irony it has. It's like 2000's making fun of the 1980's and not showing any love. He does cool stuff. That's it. He's annoying.Unikitty- She's a funny little sidekick that is too cute for her own good that it's annoying.Vitruvius- The oracle voiced by Morgan Freeman and it's HAHAHAHAHAHADHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH Awesome le Epic. Not not really.President Beezwax- He is supposed to be a menacing villian but he just like 90% of the characters comes off as childish. Good Cop Bad Cop- The main antagonist of the story. He get's his good side taken away. He's pretty cool for a lego. 7/10 I think you'll like them-ANIMATION-
In terms of art this movie is truely amazing. I've never seen a studio try to Mimic childhood stop motion animation movies through computers. It was so amazing. The lighting effects. Every location looked unique. That's all it really had going for it.-SOUND-
As I said before the dialogue is trying to hard to be childish ironically. But the Sound is unrivaled. I can't stop singing that stupid song everything is awesome. -FINAL VIRDICT 
I couldn't get into to the Lego Movie. Try as I might, but I feel that I'd rather play with Legos than watch a badly written film about them. At least it's better than the Emoji movie."
" Periodically funny, mostly innocent animation which bites off more than it can chew.
",2018-04-17 00:00:00,5,"""The Lego Movie"" plays like a loud Sunday morning cartoon, but which just so happens to have the odd reference to an old movie or life situation an adult might be able to cotton on to thrown in for good measure. It is, like so many of those cartoons, an exhausting assault of colour; noise; movement and energy - experiencing it is, indeed, very much like sitting and watching two (or more) frenetic kids playing with a vast array of Lego paraphernalia - something which, it turns out, isn't too far away from what is actually happening anyway... Despite this, there is buried within ""The Lego Movie"" somewhere the message that there is no substitute for creativity and imagination, which is admirable enough, yet rather ironically the film needed to be reigned in much more for it all to work. The story is also incredibly conventional, in its depiction of heroes; villains; mentors and love interests battling away in a place where a plot to end the world has been hatched. This wasn't something you could say about something like ""Toy Story"", which decided to eschew some of these tropes; brought to life an alternate universe within our own and also depicted an impressive two-fold character study. Meanwhile, a better example of an animated post-modernist explosion which combined rapid pacing and cultural gentrification might be 2012's ""Wreck it Ralph"". American actor Chris Pratt voices Emmett, a lowly construction worker living in a city made entirely out of Lego that is run by President Business (Will Ferrell). Business is a crypto-fascist who controls the population with cheesy pop songs and awful television shows. It is, as Neil Postman once wrote, ""...in the age of advanced technology, spiritual devastation is more likely to come from an enemy with a smiling face than from one whose countenance exudes suspicion and hate."" So slavish to this situation are the inhabitants of Emmett's world that everybody 'greets' the world each morning as one. Emmett is ripped out of his world of subconscious conformity when, one day after work, he spots an intruder on the construction site and, upon confronting them, accidentally winds up deep underground prior to experiencing an out-of-body experience which renders him unconscious. Before he knows anything, he is eye-deep in a plot to do with Business' private Gestapo and the foiling of a prophecy once made by Business' sworn enemy Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) to do with how, one day, a hero will lead the people to victory over the world of orthodoxy and order. Narrative is perfunctory for most of the film; that is until, perhaps cleverly, it wraps its story into what is REALLY happening beyond the confines of the film's universe. ""The Lego Movie"", for the most part, is too preoccupied with dragging you head first through a bush - then through another bush into the Wild West; then through another into a realm of knights and dragons before settling on something else entirely, but not before it has taken you to Cloud Cuckoo Land (don't ask) as Emmett and a collection of allies strive to defeat the bad guy. How one reacts to any of this will be dependent on one's tolerance threshold for sheer nonsense, but nonsense that is harmless fun and which does possess half a dozen genuine laughs (Vitruvius' secret knock, anyone?), while being helped along by the fact everything is made of Lego. Had it been something else other than Lego, such as 'regular' characters going about a 'regular' adventure, would anyone have really provided the film with much more than a passing grade? The makers of the film, Christopher Miller & Phil Lord, cover so much ground and flit from one to so many other places that they allow themselves licence to do anything and reference anything from any walk of life or genre. It isn't often you get Shaquille O'Neal joking about how the enemy were ""...ready for that(!)"" within minutes of Professor Dumbledore arguing with someone over the pronunciation of his name. This is actually fairly lazy, and is best epitomised when they take their characters to the aforementioned Cloud Cuckoo Land, which is, put literally, merely a locale of complete gibberish wherein anything goes. Rooted at the epicentre of the piece is a stiff, egalitarian message to do with how individualism and diversity must triumph over conformity and a refusal to accept amalgamation and hybridity, which is here depicted as pure evil. Again, how one reacts to the film will depend on your own outlooks in life - are pirates and soldiers best suited to battling one another on desert islands and across vast oceans? Or do they all need to come together with the astronauts; cowboys; spaceships; half the cast of ""Harry Potter"" and Robin Hood to have one giant adventure for any of it to be enjoyable.Despite this, the film occasionally branches off for more admirable messages to do with self-confidence and thinking for oneself - using your imagination and being creative, best demonstrated in Vitruvius' line to Emmett that he must ""embrace what is special about you."" But more tantalising is the fact there are so many objects from OUR world in the villain's possession. And why do we hear a human boy remark ""it's your turn to be the hero..."" as Emmett has his early out-of-body experience?By the time the film had ended the first time I saw it (I watched it twice), I had a headache. I was able to appreciate it a little more after the second viewing because I had a better idea of where the chaos was heading, but remain relatively dumb-founded as to why so much praise had been previously heaped on it. Many-a nice thing has been written and said about ""The Lego Movie"", but it struck me as generally a bit of a mess."
" I was ready to hate this.
",2018-03-31 00:00:00,10,"Before I watched this movie, I was prepared to say that it was terrible. Its not. The animation, voice acting, comedy, action, drama, plot, and every element I can think of is done extremely well. The only reasons I'm not giving the movie a 10/10 is because there are some bits that veer away from silly and off into stupid and because its made to sell toys. I would highly recommend this movie. It is extremely funny and entertaining."
" FUN, FUNNY AND MORE FUN
",2018-01-27 00:00:00,9,This not only takes a popular brand and make it into a movie it gives us imagination and creative thinking with a colorful world and a strong story that keeps on building into the end of the film it has moments that make us feel my favorite part was GOOD COP/BAD COP if you want to check out a film check this film out.
" The LEGO Movie: A surprising accomplishment
",2018-01-20 00:00:00,7,"I went into The Lego Movie expecting drivel, I thought it'd be alike the DC ones but without the DC element to appease me. Thankfully I was wrong, way wrong.This HUGELY acclaimed multi award winning Oscar nominated feature length animated lego movie is an entertaining roller coaster ride for all ages.With a vast cast of overpaid Hollywood stars led by Chris Pratt we see original Lego characters team with the likes of Batman, Gandalf, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman and more to foil an evil plot.The first thing that struck me is how good it all looks, considerably better than every other Lego movie I've seen from the flow of the animation to the stunning lighting effects.Okay it is pretty dumb, but it's dumb fun and thats okay by me.Silly but with enough to keep parents entertained this is a roaring accomplishment. I'm not sure I'd consider it Oscar-worthy, but then again most Oscar winners I don't consider deserving.The Lego Movie is a lot of fun and has reaffirmed my faith in them.The Good:Looks incredibleLot of funThe Bad:Still pretty silly in placesMore than a slight sprinkle of Hollywood excess and stupidityThings I Learnt From This Movie:The double decker couch actually sounds quite neatWiping your bum with a hook for a hand is really hardIt's not expected for a person to marry a marshmallow"
" No wrong way to play with LEGO...
",2018-01-16 00:00:00,8,"Fun movie, lots of great moments, but the part that sticks with me is the core message, ""There's no wrong way to play with LEGO... unless you glue them together, then you're evil and bad."""
" Everything is (relatively) awesome
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"'The Lego Movie' is exactly what you expect, but also at the same time, something unexpected. It's a bright, fast-paced, well-intentioned kids' film, but it also has quite a few genuine laughs and touching moments - not that they're out of place, just that they add some levity to the story, which sometimes does get a little too ""meta"" for it's own good.The storyline is quite straightforward - ordinary guy gets thrust into an adventure to save the Universe, defeat the bad guy (Ferrell) and find love, even though he's ""normal"" - obviously, it turns out everyone's ""Special""/unique, not just those that are prominent. What makes it stand out is how they've taken something we all know & love - I doubt anyone born in the last 40 years hasn't played with Lego as a kid - and translated it to a living world. We get to see this through Emmet (Pratt)'s eyes and it's pretty funny how they integrate corporate America - coffee, music & TV shows - into this Lego world. And it's great how the Lego looks real and only animated to move facial effects - and the animated water is great. My favourite bit was seeing Ben the 'generic 80's astronaut' (Charlie Day) - and his enthusiasm for building spaceships - who even had an authentic helmet crack where the chin strap always broke! I remember building weird spaceships for him.One of my main issues is that they've gone to such great effort to animate this world, but then they fly through most of it so quickly that you don't actually get a chance to appreciate it all! Thanks to being a Warner Brothers film, we get the benefit of seeing DC characters - Wonder Woman, Superman, Green Lantern (a great sub-plot with these two!), and especially, Batman. The casting of Will Arnett as Batman is genius - his gravelly voice perfectly suited, as well as his comic timing. The ending - combining live action with the animation actually works - is pretty good and wraps everything up nicely, while also making you care for some of these characters, even if they're little yellow blocks!"
" Batman makes the show
",2017-12-26 00:00:00,6,The first third of the movie I would only give a 4 and then Batman shows up and the dialogue turns hilarious and it seems to go into 3D Action mode. So for that third of the movie I would give it an 8. The last third is humdrum with the appearance of real humans making it humdrum again. So a six out of ten rating overall.
" Oh,I Love It
",2017-12-16 00:00:00,9,"This movie is really enjoyable. I must say that ""Everything is awesome"" in this movie ."
" A good Lego animation
",2017-09-08 00:00:00,8,"In a world where everything is made out of Lego, an ordinary guy, almost invisible to everyone, discovers a piece that can fulfill an ancient prophecy and save the universe from the evil claws of President Business. He joins a team of Master Builders and together they must plan their moves of stopping the imminent evil.It's a movie based on the Lego universe which brings together with all their constructions and contraptions a lot of famous characters like Batman, Superman and others. Although it is based on a clich√© story of an ordinary guy that must save the world, it is mostly interesting and entertaining but you cannot miss the parody-like atmosphere and it's superficiality in several acts. Those wouldn't have been such a big problem if it wasn't for its finale which is too childish and disappointing. I had some great expectations regarding this one so I'm a bit disappointed, but that doesn't mean that it is a bad movie. It's just that I hoped that it would a wonderful animation movie with Lego which frankly isn't."
" It really shouldn't work, but it does
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,7,"'The LEGO Movie' brings LEGO to life in a lively, action packed film. On paper, this movie really shouldn't have worked. Taking a popular kids' toy and making a movie out of it was a big risk and was never going to please everyone. Part of the reason it turned out so well is because it doesn't even take itself seriously. LEGO itself is the butt of many of the jokes in the film.The story is better than expected and the characters are funny and interesting. Visually this film is spectacular. The amount of detail in each frame is mind-blowing. It's amazing to watch. I would have never expected a film based on a toy to be such a hit, and not only with kids. 'The LEGO Movie' is about as good as I could have hoped it to be. If you think about the many things that could have gone wrong with this movie, it's impressive how well it was received."
" A surprisingly hilarious and heartwarming movie.
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,9,"I have¬†always hated the term ""Hollywood has run out of ideas"". Whenever I¬†hear it, it's usually regarding to a movie clearly based off a property that shouldn't be turned into a movie, particularly ones based on games and toys.¬†Movies based on them (with the exception of ""Toy Story"" of course)¬†have barely worked with one notable example being the 2012 film ""Battleship"". So¬†when I first saw the trailer for ""The Lego Movie"", I rolled my eyes and thought that this movie would never work. And you'll be very surprised when I say that I was proved completely wrong. ""The Lego Movie"" really surprised me with its clever humor, heartwarming story, memorable characters, and some fantastic animation. Yes, you read that right. ""I was¬†actually surprised by¬†The Lego Movie""¬†and I'll explain why.The film takes places in a world made out of Lego filled with many mini figures. In the big city, a normal construction worker named Emmet (Chris Pratt) lives in an average every day normal life following the instructions to a good life. One day though, he accidentally stumbles across the legendary Piece of Resistance, one of the elements of a prophecy that would be used to take down the evil Lord Business (Will Ferrell). He then is thrown into a giant war after he is rescued from custody by Wildstyle (Elizabeth Banks) who he accidentally believes to be the prophecy's¬†chosen one. Traveling through many worlds in the Lego universe,¬†its up to¬†Emmet, Wildstyle, the prophesier¬†Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), and even Batman (Will Arnett) to defeat Lord Business and his lieutenant Bad Cop (Liam Neeson) before they unleash the ultimate weapon to destroy the world, the Kragle (which is really krazy glue¬†with a worn out label). I can't say anymore, you just have to see it.The strength in this film is definitely¬†the writing. Both Phil Lord and Chris Miller clearly understood the fun of Legos and were able to craft up a world with original characters and comedy that even pokes fun of clich√©s seen in the past. One notable example is the villain telling his minions to cue his dramatic entrance using smoke and a door slamming open. Writing like this is what makes ""The Lego Movie"" stand out. The animation is fantastic. What really surprised me about it was the fact that it was actually not stop motion like I initially thought, but¬†computer animation. The film was animated by Animal Logic, the company that¬†crafted the realistic¬†movies like ""Happy Feet"" and ""Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole"". The fact that they went from making animals looking very lifelike to simple toys is a pretty big leap and an impressive leap at that. The characters were a whole bunch of fun. Each had at least one to funny¬†line to say, and had at least one unique trait to make them stand out. They also were perfectly cast as well. Chris Pratt brought a real lovable presence to Emmet while Will Arnett cracked me up with his cocky and s egotistical¬†performance as Batman. Will Ferrell even channeled his early performance of ""Megamind"" in his performance of Lord Business. If I had one problem with the movie¬†and it's pretty much a nitpick is¬†some of the humor was a little off. Most of it hit the mark, but some I just didn't catch or it was funny. However, it's really a nitpick.""The Lego Movie""¬†is probably one of the most surprising movies I have seen. With a¬†funny story, fantastic animation and memorable characters, I was left in a very happy mood, something I never thought I would say about ""The Lego Movie"". I hope that movie¬†studios will take notes on how to make movies based on properties really good,¬†because this movie set the bar very high which can be seen as either a good thing or a bad thing. I think that it's a good thing."
" All Pretty Hype - No Substance.
",2017-06-22 00:00:00,4,"This is an atrociously boringly unfunny and predictable movie, though it's beautifully shot. All the faults lie with writers and directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller.The synopsis of the movie is pretty decent and should have resulted in a good movie. A regular Lego construction worker, Emmet, finds out that he's the master builder of an ancient prophecy that states he'll save the world from the craggle and Lord Business.Where the story falls short is the overused and clich√©d jokes and characters and they were telegraphed so early you knew they were coming. For example, Emmet has only had one original design idea - a double- decker sofa; so when asked to build something when they are trying to escape from Bad-Cop and his minions, he builds (you guessed it) his double-decker sofa while everybody else builds the submarine; then when the sub is destroyed by Bad-Cop guess what survives... yep, you're right the sofa. I was groaning and shaking my head. All too predictable.Next major fault is the direction, there are lots of scenes that are dragged out too long, in particular, the scene where Bad-Cop / Good-Cop (which was a very inventive idea) is interrogating Emmet. Bad-Cop gets angry and goes mental and kicks a chair around the room. It's not that funny a scene and it becomes boring quite quickly as the directors stretch the sequence out and actually diminishes the scene.Another thing the films suffers with is the vocal talents. With the exception of Will Arnet as Bruce Wayne / Batman, Elizabeth Banks as Wyldstyle / Lucy, and Nick Offerman as Metal Beard, the rest of the voices just don't quite fit their character. I am not a big fan of Will Ferrell though I have to admit he's not too bad here as he reigns in some of his outlandishness. However, he should have been more intimidating, mean, and menacingly voiced for his character of Lord Business. I felt embarrassed for Morgan Freeman as he sounded tired, for the most part, in his rendition of Vitruvius. Then there was the grating and annoying tones of Unikitty, played by Amanda Brie, who had me reaching for the remote and the off button. I did like the way that they incorporated original voices into the cast as C3P0 was voiced by Anthony Daniels and Billy Dee Williams voiced Lando - shame they couldn't do it with the rest of the ""Known"" cast.The only good thing this film had going for it was the Lego itself and it's CGI generation. Had the rest of the film been as good these scenes it would have been a masterpiece of filmmaking. However special effects cannot carry a film alone.To be honest I wouldn't recommend this film to anybody. There are a lot of much better kids films out there... So go treat yourself and watch one of them. I wouldn't even push this for the Batman element, even though he's one of the main good elements he's still not enough... and he even starts to wear thin as the movie progresses... I'm now a little worried for The Lego Batman Movie."
" A refreshing animation which does practically everything right. An instant classic.
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,9,"I wasn't sure what to expect as I sat down to watch this movie, was it to be too childish, or will it¬†be geared towards impressing adults also?¬†Too heavy on the Lego promotion? Was it to have a solid story or be a weak mish-mash of brainless money spinning tripe? As the credits rolled at the end of the movie I can honestly say I have not been so pleasantly surprised by a movie in a long, long time. Hands down, it is fantastic.The Lego Movie has heart, it has substance and great energy. It's clever, really clever and I appreciate the level of effort and thinking that has gone into making this movie.¬†It is laugh out loud funny, not only in a slapstick way but also through witty dialogue and intelligent, sharp humour.¬†The universe created for The Lego Movie is one of the greatest aspects, the attention to detail is fantastic and nothing ever looks out of place with some brilliantly witty props and surroundings.¬†With spot on casting the Lego characters are¬†brought¬†to life, Liam Neeson, Will Ferrell and Morgan Freeman all play their part especially well in their supporting roles.¬† The story is a simple one, easy to follow but is told in an imaginative and well paced with a good array of characters, clich√©d but pleasant. It's the classic unassuming hero story, good vs potential evil with friendship and loyalty the driving points being the mission. There are plenty of funny moments, some surprisingly downbeat scenes and some well choreographed action sequences.My only real negative is that I feel it was geared a little too heavily towards 3d viewing and when viewing in standard 2d it can feel a little over the top and choppy at times. It's clear which parts would look great in 3d but when viewed standard some scenes can look like quite poor animation.Towards the end, the movie makes a bold move, a move which could quite easily have backfired and undone all the greatness. Thankfully it was pulled off extremely well, delivering just how they wanted it to and didn't feel remotely wrong in any way.The creators got it spot on. Promote Lego to the hills, kids will love so many aspects of it, adults will love it too¬†and the money will come rolling in for sequels, this is a new Universe for the animation genre and I can see it continuing for many years to come. The Batman Lego Movie¬†was released this year and with such an array of characters at their disposal, I expect to see plenty more movies in the future.A very solid 9/10"
" Well conceived, poorly assembled plaything
",2017-06-06 00:00:00,5,"The story involves the search for an object that can stop the 'Kragle'; a dangerous weapon threatening all of lego-mankind.With its mechanical meta awareness, franchise jokes, and a daring third act that shatters (not just breaks) the fourth wall, there is no question that the Lego Movie is clever. The problem is that the self mockery is too heavy. That and a jumbled story line, visually incoherent action scenes, and shallow emotional content make for a mediocre movie.Our protagonist is a modern version of the construction worker character from Lego's first packages. He is as amusingly mundane as the movie tells us he is, but remains mundane in those few moments when he is supposed to amount to something more. He goes from being a spoof on the hapless hero to being just another version of one.The most memorable piece of the movie is the ear worm song 'Everything is Awesome' which is as cheesy as it is addicting. Other highlights are Liam Neeson's Good Cop/Bad Cop, and a happy go lucky unicorn with a demonic alter ego lurking just under the happy face. Lego Batman has enough moments to have made him easily worthy of his own movie (which he now has). We also have all the other DC and Marvel heroes who are there just so the makers can check their names off the list.The ending takes us out of Legoland and into the three dimensional world. Here we get the punchline, the revelation of what exactly the 'Kragle' is. They has a cute idea, but it comes with notes of forced sentiment that fall rather flat.By focusing to much on mocking the gimmick of the toy, as well all the franchise characters, the movie itself ends up feeling like a gimmick. There is no heart, soul or narrative shape, and the scattered laughs don't make it worth the time."
" A must see animation
",2017-05-26 00:00:00,9,"What happens when you mix parody and product placement for a toy brand into one film? you get yourself The Lego Movie, one of the greatest animations of the 2010's. Plus there is also the great voice acting specially from Liam Neeson who plays bad cop/good cop. The film follows the history of Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt), an ordinary and generic lego construction worker who found the Piece of Resistance and is prophesied to be the ""Special One"", the hero who will save the universe from lord Business (voiced by Will Farrel). As I said this movie is a parody of chosen one histories where Emmet is ""the most interesting, important and talented person of the world"" but when he is just a generic lego toy. The irony about this film is that it somewhat criticizes capitalism (the monopoly of big companies , being alienated by these companies, etc.) but it's one of the biggest product placement of all time to be presented in a movie."
" One of the most creative and refreshing movies of the decade.
",2017-05-23 00:00:00,10,"When I first saw the trailers for the Lego Movie, I scoffed at it, thinking that it would be nothing more than a gigantic toy commercial for Legos, but much to my surprise, when I sat down to watch it earlier this year, what I got was a thoroughly creative and fun movie that seemed to resonate more with adults than with kids.In a world populated by Lego figurines, the malicious Lord Business discovers a weapon known as the ""Kragle"", but the wizard Vitruvius tries to stop him only to be left vision-less by Business's robots; he foretells of a being called ""the Special"" will acquire a block known as the Piece of Resistance and stop the Kragle. Some years later, an ordinary construction worker named Emmett Brockowski encounters a woman named Wyldstyle at his job and while trying to follow her, falls into a pit and locates the Piece of Resistance, proceeds to touch it then wakes up with the piece fixed to his back, in the captivity of Bad Cop. Wyldstyle then saves Emmett, certain that he is the Special, takes him to meet Vitruvius in the Old West. Now, Emmett, Wyldstyle and the rest of the master builder community must untie in order to stop Lord Business from executing his plans.Given that the story does follow the Matrix in a lot of ways, it would seem like it would be retreading the plot of the 99' movie a bit too much, yet when you see the Lego world, everything in it feels original and hot off the press, something I wish more kids movies would do rather than rehash the same ideas over and over again and it seems that Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the two guys who gave us ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" and the Jump Street films, and the writers really knocked out of the ballpark with this one.When it comes to the animation, The Lego Movie has some of the best seen in the last few years and is great enough to rival Disney or Pixar. Not only does it have the look of a beginners stop-motion movie with a high budget, but the magnitude of the detail and the imagination put into the animation is nothing short of amazing rather than just using some cheap CGI. At some points throughout the movie, there's simply so much going on that it's pushing overwhelming limits, yet if one is a careful observer, they might see that every single little item from the people to the sky are built in Lego pieces. The numerous ways the Lego world moves, crumbles, is built again, crumbles apart and changes is just a delight to see. The usage of items from the real world being used in the Lego universe is guaranteed to get a massive chuckle out of anyone watching the film, and the aftereffect is a movie that looks so unlike any other movie we've seen before.The script is a non-stop thrill ride of one sidesplitting gag after another not to mention the jokes often come at you so quickly that it's impossible to get them all the first time you watch the movie, and blink and you'll-overlook-it quips that litter the screen. No joke ever seems to overstay it's welcome or is overdone or overstated with some of the best jokes come from Emmett and well as from other characters throughout the film. One thing that the movies so expertly well is how it pokes fun at the whole prophecy story line that has been such a mainstay in big Hollywood movies and the way that they handle it is both hilarious and yet feels new. There are also quite a few pop culture references ranging from Star Wars to The Terminator and The Dark Knight sprinkled thought-out the movie too.The characters of the Lego Movie are a lot of fun to watch and the assemble cast is one of the best in an animated film since Toy Story: Chris Pratt is the prefect choice for Emmett, playing the eager and innocent sides of the character with ease, manages to be in incredibly funny often getting some of the movie's best jokes and also shows quite a lot of character growth as he learns how to think for himself rather then conform. While I'm not a big fan of Elizabeth Banks, she is awesome in this movie as Wyldstyle, hurling out plenty of sharp quips and kicking ass when she needs to, but she is also so much more than that by being more of a symbol of individually which is an interesting take on a female lead in this kind of movie and certainly better than having her hook up with Emmitt at the end. Morgan Freeman is always excellent is anything he's in and here, he brings the same wise-man vigor as Vitruvius while almost making fun of the other mentor roles he's played in other movies and is truly a delight to watch. Will Ferrell is completely devilish and threatening as Lord Business and yet is a complete laugh riot, channeling his Mugatu character from Zoolander with ease. Charlie Day is a joy as the Lego spaceman Benny, Nick Offerman is great as Metalbeard, Alison Brie is enchanting as Unikitty, Liam Neeson is down right hilarious as Good Cop/Bad Cop, but it's Will Arnett as Batman who steals the movie as there are simply too many times in the movie where he has a line of dialog that makes every intentional funny scene even more laugh-out-loud funny.I really don't have any negative things to say about the Lego movie, it's just superb with great characters, top-notch animation and voice acting, wonderful jokes, and one hell of a catchy song. Definitely a movie worth checking out."
" Lego Movie Review Bryce
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,9,"If you like legos then the Lego Movie is the movie you would to watch. This movie was so funny it made my stomach hurt. Unikitty is a unicorn mixed with a cat! Six people were stranded in the water and Batman says, ""It's not like a big ship is going to come.... and that just happened!"" Unikitty lives in a place called Cloudcoocoo Land and there is a giant puppy face that they make speeches in! This movie is so cool it is amazing! There is a cool pirate ship and it is big, a pirate named Metel beard is on it! Batmancame with is bat place and flew through the sun! The main character Emmett made a giant robot with a wrecking ball on the back and a bulldozer scoop for a hand. This movie is so exciting! ON the big ship they needed a hyperdrive for a plane and the Millennium Falcom came and Batman went in and took their hyperdrive! Superman was in Cloudcoocoo Land and he did not like Green Lantern! The Batplane flew to a knight and shining armor place and the Batplane turned into the Batmobile! In conclusion now you know the Lego Movie is a great and funny movie! The Lego Movie is the one movie you would want to watch if you like Legos! I hope you will love The Lego Movie as much as you love Legos!"
" Looks like everything about this movie really is awesome.
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,10,"Originally, I was expecting this movie to suck, because of the Lego TV shows on Cartoon Network, or maybe it's also because of the straight to video Lego movies, but it didn't suck. It was an absolutely hilarious and awesome movie. They actually poke fun at the clich√©s, and it works perfectly. It has now also became of my favorite franchises ever. I have always liked the character Emmet after watching this movie, because he's pretty much just like me. I wasn't very creative when it comes to building Legos, and was always following the instructions. Batman was awesome in this movie as well. I have even seen the Lego Batman Movie recently last month, and it too was awesome. I hope the same thing will happen to the Lego Ninjago Movie six more months later. Now, THIS movie feels like if it was influenced by Yellow Submarine. I know this movie was actually inspired by stop-motion Lego brickfilms, but this movie also feels like Yellow Submarine. And yes, Legos are made to move like stop-motion, unless in video games, maybe. But either way, I love the Lego Movie."
" Everything is Awesome¬Ö well almost everything
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,9,"Lego construction worker Emmet is a bit of a drone; he watches the most popular TV show, he listens to the most popular song and most importantly he always follows the instructions. Then one day he loses his instructions; he searches the construction site for it and stumbles upon the 'Piece of Resistance'. Also there is a girl named Wyldstyle who was looking for the piece. She explains to him that is a near mythical item that will enable the 'Special' to defeat the evil President Business. She assumes that Emmet is the Special but the more she sees of him the less sure she is. Far from being the Master Builder she expected he has just about zero imagination. Before they can conform Business they will team up with Wylestyle's boyfriend, Batman; recruit other Master Builders and keep one step ahead of Business's henchman, Bad Cop.When I played with Lego as a child I never imagined that one day there would be a Lego movie and if I had I doubt I'd have imagined that it would be enjoyed by anybody apart from young children but here I am, almost fifty, and I must say I really enjoyed this film. It is chock full of references to other films in a way that older viewers will love without boring younger viewers who don't get the references. The characters are a lot of fun; Emmet and Wyldestyle are great leads but it is Batman who steals the show, it is no wonder that he just got his own movie. The story is simple enough for younger viewers and the execution is imaginative in a way that should entertain all ages. If there is a weakness it is when the action moves to the real world and we see a boy playing with his father's Lego; here we get the message of the movie and it is about as subtle as a brick (not a Lego brick); it also pulls the viewer out of the story just as it reaches its peak; still it isn't enough to spoil this entertaining film. The animation is great; it is especially impressive when we see Lego creations being made in front of our eyes. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to any fan of animated movies; it is fun from start to finish."

Emmet Brickowoski (Chris Pratt) just wants to fit in with all of his neighbors and coworkers. He believes the best way to do that is by following the strict instructions given to him by the President of the Lego society, Lord Business (Will Ferrell). Little does Emmet know that Lord Business is actually planning to destroy the whole world using a powerful tool called CraGle, Crazy Glue. A prophecy made by an old man Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) predicts that a master builder will find a powerful piece that can stop the destruction.With the help of his henchman Bad Cop (Liam Neeson) who has personality disorders and sometimes is good, Lord Business captures Emmet who wakes up to find that the powerful piece is stuck to his back. Emmet manages to escape when he is saved by Wild Style (Elizabeth Banks) and brought to Vitruvius to discover his destiny.

" Like the Title Song says...
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,9,"Today, before watching an animated movie, the biggest question is ""which element of newness can it ever provide to eyes that have enjoyed hundreds of Disney (and even DreamWorks) classics?"" Indeed, as time goes by and the audiences get more blas√©, the probability for an animated film to meet with commercial success might be relatively high, but whether it would stand the test of time and become a classic is another story. Each of the three 'Shrek' sequels did pretty well in the box-office, but compared to the first opus, they're all pretty forgettable.But this is an adjective I wouldn't use for ""The Lego Movie"" as it is a wonderfully crafted and smartly conceived animated comedy. It doesn't just bring enjoyment; it also possesses such a meticulous attention to little details that you wouldn't mind watching it again in case you missed something. Of course, the very premise of an animated movie made of Lego bricks is to challenge the eyes with as many details as one can spot in a simple blink, that's the essence of the Lego bricks, but the writers or creators didn't just take that high-concept for granted: the special effects are the vehicles to a solid plot and a story with a message that is positive without being dull or predictable.There's a moment where all the protagonists meet in Cuckoo Cloud Land (or was it Cloud Cuckoo Land)? And although some of the characters in the background add nothing to the story, the multiple cameos they form is simply irresistible (they go from Simpsons characters to Ninja Turtles or movies and fairy tales icons) you really have to push the pause button if you want to spot each of them. This perfectionism has nothing to envy on Disney's and reward our expectations as we don't expect uncluttered landscapes from a Lego film. And while it starts with Lego Land and the ominous President Business' building, it also gets out of the urban zone of comfort and make us fly over the vast Western canyons or enjoy a trip on and under the sea, the occasion for many cool effects simulating waves, smokes or clouds.Last time I had as much fun was with ""Rango"" and there's some kinship between the two films besides not being from Disney (or another 3D major studio), they have extremely appealing heroes. Rango had a certain edgy quality but Emmett (Christ Pratt) is simply too sweet for words. It's like the writers, instead of taking the wrong step and making the most possibly original character, went to the totally opposite trajectory, making an even more original one. This is a Lego-man who sees the half filled glass, who cheers at everything, because in Lego life, everything is built upon instructions, you can't do any wrong because that's an option life doesn't include. So nothing can upset him: the lousy one-joke sitcom, the overpriced coffee, his motto echoes the town's hymn ""Everything is Awesome"", a cheesy electronic pop hit that seems to come directly from the 90's. But under this cheerful front, Lego Land lives with an impending doom of evil President Business (Will Ferrell) and according to Vitrivirus, a wizard with the voice of Morgan Freeman, a chosen one will save the town (quite a prophecy, isn't it?), it turns out to be Emmett, but he needs to believe it to succeed. The film takes one of the cheesiest clich√©s but makes it the soul of its message and making something original out of conventional stuff is a stunt I didn't think was possible. And the is the kind of masterstroke I won't dare to spoil but let's just say, there comes a moment where even the comedic inventiveness can't drive the plot, and the writers need an extra push and we make the one discovery that gives its full meaning to the Lego, the reason why anyone can enjoy it.Speaking for myself, I stopped playing Lego when I got a new digit in my age but playing now with my daughter, I rediscover the appeal behind this simple but genius concept, interlocking brick one or another, creating more and more challenging forms, some with a meaning, others not, but avoiding dullness at all costs. There is something in Lego that is so boundlessly creative, that you can't help but feel the need to reinvent stories or scenarios within the limits of your mind's imagination. It's just as if the 3D animation existed before the screen version, and ""The Lego Movie"" was inevitable. And it is perhaps the only animation process where the temptation of portraying the 'player' was so strong, as if there was something subtly existential or deeply metaphysical in that quest for perfection. I had a foretaste after watching the Simpsons 'Lego' episode, there's indeed some great source of creativity behind these little bricks.Nevertheless, this quest for perfection is integral to the film's appeal, so is the need to deconstruct things for the sake of imagination. There was something in that Cuckoo Land that reminded me of South Park's ""Imagination Land"", and this is what the film is about: the power of imagination, and that includes imagining yourself as a hero, and being able to build and to decompose as well. And not to make the film sounds too philosophical, it is also a terrific comedy with superb characters, including Elizabeth Banks as the bad-ass WyldStyle (the jokes about her names never get old), a 80's Spaceman and Unikitty, a hilarious mix of Hello Kitty and 'My Little Pony' style unicorns.Honorable mention to the scene-stealing performance by Bruce Wayne aka Batman and a funny twist on the good cop/bad cop trope, well it's full of pop culture references, they're good but they're not even the best thing about the film.Everything is awesome in that 'Lego' movie and I'm looking forward for the sequels."
" Lego on steroids
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,6,"The Lego movie has an imaginative original story, great characters, dialogues and message. The story mixes a bit of surrealism, absurdity and child-like stories and mixes it with a bit of super-hero stuff and a bit of social critique. The dialogues are funny and witty. The narrative is perhaps my favorite part of the film.The animation is excellent, however this is not the sort of visuals I enjoy. I say this because the film is visually overwhelming, too much happening on every scene, too many figurines in each scene, too much is too much. Besides, the movie has no tempo or pace, or the pace is just run run run -- Lego on steroids. So I watched this movie with some sort of visual anxiety if that can be said. Unfortunately, it is not just a bit here and there, it is from beginning to end, so I felt it was an exhausting watching despite me liking the story overall.The same story, the same Lego pieces, with a bit of more air and a different pace would have produced a rounder more enjoyable film, at least to me.The Lego Movie tries to remind us all of how important is to play with toys, to develop our imagination, and how being silly is actually quite smart at times. Playing with toys has no rules, no limits, it can be as silly or senseless as you want, as long as you are having fun, all is possible."
