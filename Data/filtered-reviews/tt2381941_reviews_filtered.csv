" Nice and not nice.
",2021-03-05 00:00:00,7,"It's unusual as Focus is both underrated and overrated at parts.
Will Smith comes as Nicky an Con artist with emotion, but same acting from him seeking sympathy is what we have seen before. So is Margot Robbie too stands in the same measures as we have seen earlier whatever she does. Brennan Brown is nice to watch.Starts smooth but ends like a falling sandwich, it has the elements but in trembled in the end. But it's watchable. Obviously expectations are always high when such a star cast is there but again not all sandwiches are memorable. But all sandwiches are tasteable. So is this movie Focus, no need to watch it with Focus.Available on Netflix."
" Too much romance... Too many bed scenes
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,2,"Too much romance. Too many unnecessary and annoying bed scenes.
Has a couple cool twists, but the ""romance"" slowed movie way too much, and messed up movie.
I guess Will Smith wanted to stretch his acting bounds, but this is wrong movie to do that"
" Changed my life
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,1,"I'd never seen WS in such a terrible story. His acting is like a punch to the stomach in a hangover. And Margot, oh boy, thank god she's pretty. Yet, I'd be offended if I was a woman. She portraits everything that's bad for a female role. Really poor and stupid story that tried to be filled with absurd charisma. I've never written a review before, so trust me well. Do not watch this horrible film if you value your neurons enough. I am willing to pay whatever it takes if someone can successfully make me unseen it."
" This is move better than willllllly smith he is amazing actor
",2021-01-14 00:00:00,7,This is move better than willllllly smith he is amazing actor
" A good movie to watch
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,8,An old-fashioned film frame Served by a convincing and above all captivating duo of actors. Sometimes in the cinema you have to know how to let perfection and just make the pleasure and enthusiasm speak. Mention to the captivating Margot Robbie who stands out as the new modern sex symbol of US cinema.
" An average con, an average movie
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,5,"Focus is your typical transcontinental-flight-movie. A decent time-waster, provided you don't look too close or think too much.Like many of these movies, it starts off well enough to hook an unknowing viewer, and after a lengthy introduction (40% of the runtime), runs out of steam. The viewer is then left with typical he-knew-all-along cons, mixed with random shots of luck that could have been planned out, leaving everyone with events that don't match the characters' pretended omniscience.If the movie doesn't believe in its own tricks, neither can the audience. Good thing is, the in-flight drinks will have knocked most of out it long before the movie ends."
" Clever and great
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,9,"So many plot twists,so clever plans and im glad Margot is in it,she is stunning"
" ...and see the unseen
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,7,"Very polished, very Hollywood, but well written and enjoyable. Will is Will, Margot is hard to take your eyes off. It's worth watching. ðŸ™‚"
" Slightly below average but it isn't the worst film I've ever seen.
",2020-10-18 00:00:00,5,"Tried to get into movie as hard as I could but it just wasn't engaging/exciting enough. The cast did good job with the acting but there just wasn't anything memorable that stood out. Also too many times the movie was all over the place as well did poor job of explaining certain characters action. I wasn't a big fan of the ending either it was just strange and abrupt. Its not the best movie, but its not the worst. I wouldn't recommend it though either way."
" Not a great con artist film, but still quite enjoyable
",2020-09-16 00:00:00,8,"I've always been a bit of a sucker for movies about con artists. I think part of it is the fact that these movies tend to have a built in twist ending because there's always someone being tricked, and we are rarely in on the con, so this makes the entire movie feel a bit like a mystery that I get to solve as I watch. Many of those elements are present in Focus, and that's why I enjoyed it so much. I did feel like I was a few steps ahead of people in this film, because they telegraph some of the tricks ahead of time, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the ride until the final reveal. The charming cast didn't hurt, as Will Smith is a great leading man for this kind of role, and Margot Robbie has a good report with him (even if their romantic connection wasn't the most convincing.) I also love Adrian Martinez any time he shows up for some comic relief, so it was nice to see him in a supporting role here.I'll admit that Focus is loaded with flaws, though. As I already mentioned they foreshadow elements of the cons way too early, and make it too obvious what is coming. There's also the fact that these people are genuine criminals who aren't preying on worse crooks or evil people. They are straight-up thieves who take from the innocent. We really shouldn't be rooting for any of them, but there's a playful lightness to the crimes that make you think it's not that big of a deal. I also wish they made Margot Robbie's character a stronger part of the film. For most of the runtime, she is just there to receive the exposition, or as a prize for Smith to win. I can totally understand someone thinking Focus is a bad movie, or saying it is horribly flawed, because I can see the problems with it. However, I found enough to like that I'll probably watch it again."
" Bottom line
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,6,"Movies about con games have proven popular when they are done right such as ""Big Hand For A Little Lady"" or ""The Sting"", but if the plot twists become too convoluted you loose the audience - for me this includes ""Now You See Me"" and the sequel.The first half of this movie shows some slick - perhaps TOO slick - conmen and women engaged in a variety of scams, led by Will Smith. The second half devolves into a game of ""you know someone is getting conned, but who?""SPOILERS: In the beginning Smith tells a story about how you fool the mark by shooting your partner, so you know something like that is going to happen and when it does, it's more of a groan than an ""aha"" moment. After that, it just falls apart like a house of cards.Points for some nice twists early on, but after the New Orleans scenes, it gets mired in cliches."
" Great film
",2020-08-02 00:00:00,9,"I honestly really enjoy the film, people say there are unanswered questions and plot holes but honestly I think the movie covers everything after watching it for a 10th timeSPOILERat the end of the film for example when Nicky is being interrogated he says 'lying backs you up in a corner and it forces you to do dumb ' while looking at Owens and I realize now that is telling him to hit the Toledo Panic Button. Which is why Owens says right after something along the lines of, you wanna die' because he was 0-3 when it came to people surviving when he hit the panic button. Little details like this happen in the movie often which answers many peoples unanswered questions you just have to focus. Pun intended"
" Blingy glitz that doesn't really sparkle
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,3,"While sitting in a bar, a confidence trickster (Will Smith) is played by grifter Jess (Margot Robbie) and goes along with the sting when her partner busts, pretending to be her boyfriend and go to rob him. Nicky turns the tables on them, but sees promise and takes Jess under his wing for some more big time tricks before a potential attraction confuses the partnership.Slick and glossy conman and heist kind of picture that is so excessively over the top to the point of being tedious. Once you look past the stylisation and blingy glamour, the dialogue and premise are quite laughably silly and shallow. The one stand out moment is the gamble with B.D. Wong, though Smith's explanation is laughable."
" Intriguing film.A film for connoisseurs who want neither action nor comedy, but just a good film.
",2020-07-30 00:00:00,9,"I don't like movies that don't have action, except comedy movies. This movie doesn't have both, but I'm really intrigued by the story itself. You shouldn't miss a part of this movie to find out what's going on. It's one of those movies where when you switch channels for interesting things and you come across this movie, it kind of makes you watch it without taking your eyes off it. And if you are careful when you catch in some initial part, almost everything about the film can become clear to you."
" It's just eye candy.
",2020-07-22 00:00:00,5,"Whether you've the hots for Robbie or Smith, that and a few nifty twists, is all this film has going for it: Beautiful people stealing things in a slick manner."
" Different kinda romance
",2020-07-09 00:00:00,6,I enjoyed the film very well. The romantic scenes between Will and Margot was lovely .
" I enjoyed this on the whole
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,8,"Yeah I quite enjoyed this film in all honesty. I got Now You See Me vibes quite a lot as the viewer is often left wondering when something happens if it is part of some sort of con/trick. I personally enjoy that kind of thing as you're left guessing a lot of the time and when it gets revealed it's a great feeling.Characters I thought were likeable and I thought the romantic side of things wasn't overdone and the thriller side was more evident, which is a good thing because I didn't click on this to watch a romance film.My only issue with this film is that
1: all other characters weren't in it enough to give me any sort of connection for them
2: the ending was a bit odd. I felt like the film needed another 15 mins or so before ending, but it just dropped to credits. The film ended and you got what you wanted, but I feel like there's unanswered questions still that really needed to be answered."
" Entertaining!
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,7,"This movie is funny , clever and entertaining , you keep guessing till the very end. You won't regret watching it"
" Constructive Criticism and Questions.
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,7,"From the perspective I see this genre of movie, I love it. There's the thrill, the romance, the hustle of each character bringing out concepts of gambling and pickpocketing to turn into luxury level criminals, with side notes of comedy.One detail within the script I can't let go is the scene where Nicky and Jess are held captive and interrogated by Rafael, audience is introduced with an A to Z story on how Nicky stole the EXR.Nicky: ""(...) All I needed was for her to enter your room.Glimpses of Rafael speaking over the phone in Italian.
Jess is inside Rafael's room (which you know it because all hotels rooms have the same pattern) hiding the necklace beneath the clothes inside her luggage bag.Rafael starts to laugh and takes off the silver tape, Jess confesses:
""Garriga's not my boyfriend.""The whole scene goes on, why and how they're not together, Jess even says she has Scrabble in her room at some point, which leads us to this part:
Rafael: ""She's never even been in my room.""I wonder why is this included in the script the way it is introduced or how can it even come after all this discussion? Am I missing something?Besides this detail, if you look up closer to each frame after the shooting, you can still see the Piaget Emperor in Rafael's wrist when Jess curses him, although this is less blatant than the script, it's still there if you stop and analyse, but it's gone when he alleges:
""This is your mess!"" and walks away.Can anyone explain the script or deduce why?
PS: I've watched I Love You Phillip Morris without knowing it was directed by the same directors, and I also watched Cats & Dogs at the movies when i was a kid with my mom and sister. Wouldn't imagine I'd still be watching the same directors after 19 years."
" Must watch
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,10,"Listen! don't believe in other's reviews .
If you will Smith fan then you must watch."
" not very good. Anoying dialogues and plot moves
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,3,"Not very good. Anoying dialogues and plot moves.
Actors are ok, so watched because of them."
" A romantic comedy disguised as a con movie
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,8,"It's not a bad movie.
It is certainly full of good twists and con sequences that play with you and lead you to a good resolution.
It doesn't try to be more that it pretends: that doesn't make it a perfect movie, but sincere and entertaining.The first hour is better than the second one, and I think it has to do with the mixture of genres and the search for the tone.
There are sequences where the genres fight each other, trying to be at the same time a con movie and a rom-com.At the end of the day, not the most memorable plot, but an interesting proposition in the search for the tone, with good actings, well-done twists and con sequences. A movie that delivers what it promises, and nothing more.It's worth a careful and focused look."
" The most joyless and boring experience I have ever sat through.
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,2,"I could not actually sit through this thing. I literally couldn't.Let's talk about the pros.PROS:Margot Robbie is nice to look at, I suppose.
The title is the most intriguing title I have ever heard of for a film.
Will Smith seems as if he's trying to make this film worth watching.
The soundtrack (with The Rolling Stones and other fantastic old rock songs like that) is too good for this hot garbage.
The cinematography is some of the best of 2015, the only reason this film is not a 1/10.
The twists are, ummmmm--NEGATIVES
The screenplay SUCKSSSSSSSSSSSSS.
The acting SUCKSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS.
There is no charisma at all with the characters and Will Smith is just boring to watch due to this.
IT WAS BORRRRRINGGGGGGGGGGG.
It feels as if it is one big first act and one ""two second"" second and one ""half-second"" third act.
The film is annoying.
The film acts like it's so fun when it's really not
AT
ALL.
The pace is some of the worst, second thought, the worst pacing I have ever seen in a film that's shorter than 120 minutes.
It is so forgettable and overlylong, I'd rather watch a SuperMarioLogan video, It might be a awful video, but at least it isn't overly long.I wish I could continue writing this review but it hurts to type this. It hurts to think about this boring POS, I'd just recommend watching literally anything else, like literally, ANYTHING. Go watch literally anything else. You'll just want to run out in the middle of the road and scream for someone to run you over by the 1 hour and 20 min mark, which btw, I stopped watching the film at that point because it was giving me a headache to continue watching.PS. THE ENDING IS THE WORST ENDING OF ANY COMEDY THAT HAS COME OUT IN THE ENTIRE CENTURY"
" the lovers' con
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,6,"I'm interested in this movie because of a film with the crime genre and of course, Margot Robbie the rising star. I think that it cannot be said that a crime movie with the gangsters and the serious guys in a classical way as you would expect. There's just right amount of sense of humour throughout the movie. Although there are some blanks of the script, my concentration stays the same right until the entertaining finale.
As a lead character, Will Smith did a great job. Margot Robbie was fine aswell and fitted her character ""Jess"" who is a little bit spoiled girl and a hot thief.
Especially, when the lovers did meet again, the excitement and the adrenalin kinda rises in the movie. And that spreads to the unexpected finale. I didn't love it but it's kinda worth watching. So, if you love the genre of comedy-crime and got free time, i will recommend it.
And i gotta say this... Margot Robbie looks smokin' hot for the entire movie."
" Bad
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,4,Entertaining but full of silly plot holes and unrealiatic.
" Ignore negative reviews
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,8,"This movie is enjoyable
watched the first past on a coach from Tallinn to Latvia few years ago .Seen the ending when I returned home
A little haphazard ,yet very decent con/movie"
" I really want to like this
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,5,"This could have been a better movie.
One of Will Smith's movies that could have been avoided.
It is all over the place and not really that good, messy.
And I do not like how it is glorifying thieves. There's just something wrong with that in my opinion."
" OMG BAD.
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,1,"This movie was completely lost in the first minutes. The scene at the start where Smith goes to the hotel room with Margo and they do the ""my husband"" routine was incredibly bad. I had to go vomit it was so disgustingly acted and written. First we are to believe that Margo's character is going to take HOURS, they closed the bar down, to get this guy to the hotel room? Seriously, these kinda scams are fast. Second and this is the big one, Smith's character tells the guy to shot him? Completely unbelievable. I and likely you have seen scenes like this where the guy says ""go ahead shot"" or something like that and they have been very believable. This was not one of them at all. Third, the guy never beats him or pistol whips him? They all just become great friends and walk off into the sunset? Complete lose of credibility. (I know they did not walk off as friends in the movie, what I did there was use hyperbole, look it up). Then the scene where he is teaching her some skill for stealing items, the one in the snow, it was again overplayed and not believable. The only way it could be was if she were playing him and pretending to not have any scam skills. That is not at all how that scene played out, it completely seemed to me and the people I watched with as if she really had no idea how to do any of that and was seeing it for the first time. The New Orleans all of a sudden she the most talented person he has ever seen in his life? complete rubbish start to finish. It is a shame really because Smith and Robbie are both good actors and it would have been great to see them in a film that was better written and better directed."
" Movie could've been better
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,2,The plot was actually pretty good but the movie was so confusing and from the beginning of the movie i didnt get it already
" Chef Oshowole
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,10,"Hi @FocusMovieUK,My Name is Deoye Oshowole, i watched Focus movie a while back. Please can you help confirm how my family name got to be used in your movie (chef Oshowole)?I'm sure you can appreciate my curiosity considering this name is VERY unique to my family from a small town in Oyo state, Nigeria in West Africa...Just keen to know the background to this or if this name means something else in another language (will be totally shocked)?Thanks and Best regards,Deoye Oshowole, London, UK."
" Look for Will Smith
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,7,"The first work after the comeback, compared to the expectations, the film itself may be somewhat disappointed. But Will Smithis still so handsome.There are some eye-catching points, but it is undeniable that the coherence of the plot is really a bit poor."
" Please watch Focus!!
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,10,It's the best movie I ever seen! Will smith and Margot Robbie had really brilliant chemistry together and they were the best onscreen couple I ever seen and I hope they do sequel because we've been waiting 5 years and it's time for another because I'm really curious what happened to Nicky and Jess at the end
" A bit above average until the disappointing end.
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,5,"As other reviewers have noted first 30 minutes are solid and the two leads are great. They're both actually fine throughout the whole movie.
Too many plot twists and turns with double and triple crosses. When there are too many double crosses in the plot you don't believe anything. That's the problem I had.
The ending was just not believable to me. Seemed silly. Don't wanna give away details and a spoiler. It's worth watching but it could've been better with a well-crafted plot and a refined ending."
" Really succesesuful movie
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,10,A great act from will smith and margot robbie cast are selected perfectly at the begining the goal of actors gives us very good you can easily get what they want the confilict between two swindler are really great you cant predict some scenes of this movie which is really fun.
" Poor script
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,7,"Esperei um final bem melhor.Mas vale a pena para ver o Will Smith e a Margot Robbie. E o Rodrigo Santoro. No Netflix. Focus. I waited for a very better ending, but it worth to see Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Rodrigo Santoro.#netflix #movieslover"
" Just one thing:

" Good Will Smith Film
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,6,"I never got Will Smith. Then I watched Focus and now I got him. Not in a Kevin Spacey kind of way, i just see him now as the very charismatic leading man everyone else sees him as.Focus is the name. Focus is the game as this film features a sharp script with entertaining characters and the direction achieves genuine suspense and misdirection. Con men are hard to make sympathetic with the whole identify theft stuff, so it shows how good Will Smith is that he can pull it off. The protagonist comes off as smart, charming and vulnerable. Everything you want in an Alfie type film such as this.Margot Robbie is also good, being convincing in her arc from novice to less than novice. A very natural presence and her and Smith have great chemistry. Another shout out would be in a all round solid cast would be Gerald McRaney who though isn't in the film for that long has an equal amount of charm as the two leads.The cinematography is great, but some shots look flat. I don't know why, just some of them lack depth. Maybe it was the editing. Perhaps I'm too used to montages and the like. But really, I'm struggling to find anything bad to say about the film. Maybe the misdirection goes a little too far and makes the drama a bit floaty. But that's it. I'm done.Overall, Focus is a well written, shot and acted crime dramady that is an easy recommend to fans of the genre as well as that Will Smith guy."
" Better ending
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,7,Climax could have been trickier and complex. Overall movie is great but climax kinda ruined the expirience
" relaxing movie
",2020-03-27 00:00:00,7,The chemistry between the stars and their charm sits the key to keeping the film alive and smooth. The film is a film that keeps the audience out of reality from the beginning and end and just wants a pleasure.
" Very distracting.
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,7,Charismatic and engaging thriller comedy with a sparkling script and rich characters.It loses some steam after the second act but it's still a very agreeable movie.
" Focus is fantastic ... but ...
",2020-01-26 00:00:00,8,"This is entertaining, exciting, stimulating, clever and a masterwork ... almost. The last 15 minutes of the film pushed it a little bit too much for me and undid a lot of the rest of the film. But even so, I recognize how good it is and one day I will see it again and know that I will enjoy it, just like I did this first time."
" I LOVE WILL SMITH BUT THIS FILM IS HIS WORST!!!
",2019-12-16 00:00:00,1,"First off I'm a huge Will Smith fan & have been since a young teen, i grew up watching & loving ""The Fresh Prince of Bel Air"" series & have followed his fantastic career from being my favourite Rapper & to big budget blockbuster movies like ""Independence Day"" & ""Men In Black"" & I've followed this great guy all the way up to now 2019, Smith is my favourite actor & my favourite Rapper as well as abit of a role model for me & he's an icon but even the best have their bad ones & his ""Focus"" is the absolute worst film Smith has ever made!!!
This crime caper is just completely Boring as hell & so uninteresting that i had to turn it off halfway through!!!
Even Will Smith's cool charm couldn't save this BORING film.Lots of people have blasted his sci-fi Adventure film ""After Earth"" as his worst but it's definitely Not!!!
I enjoyed After Earth for a what it was & that's a simple sci-fi survival adventure & although Smith is more robotic in his ways & not very emotional he gave a strong serious & intense performance, yes he played 2nd to his son Jaden Smith but i liked the troubled father son relationship, it wasn't terrible & i liked it.Now back to the boring as hell ""Focus"" here although Smith is always very Cool he's very boring & the film is slow & pointless, even Margot Robbie was boring to watch here & yet they were both Excellent in the extremely underrated Suicide Squad 2016, where Robbie played crazy villain Harley Quinn & Smith played the deadly Assassin Deadshot & both worked perfectly together!!!
The chemistry is just boring & dull in ""Focus"" & i couldn't get into it at all, so yes Smith is great & still my favourite actor ever but this is one of his extremely rare ""Bad films"""

" my notes
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,5,"I liked this movie the first time i watched it. i was debating between 3.0 and 3.5 and reluctantly gave it a 3.5. i was then very hesitant to watch it a second time, which i realize was for good reason. this movie isn't good. i was debating between 2.0 and 2.5 but decided to go higher since i enjoyed if the first time. it has some decent visual style. a lot of ppl probably like the tone of the musical score but i wasn't a fan. and that kind of set the tone for the whole movie. i remember the first time watching some of the stuff that happens and questioning whether it's believable. i gave it the benefit of the doubt and was ok with it. on second viewing, i am not. i just don't buy it, multiple parts where i have to suspend disbelief, i cannot. and i am the kind of person who tries his best to go with the flow and give the movie the benefit of the reasonable doubt. but so much didn't make sense. so many things had to happen perfectly for some of this stuff to work. so many times it could have failed if one, or eight, little things happened. i dunno if i was blinded by her beauty, but there were multiple cringe-inducing acting scenes by Margot Robbie. it's possible she was directed this way, but so many of her reactions were so cheesy and not believable. her omg moments were so lame. and the first half of the movie was so much better than the second half. which felt like a completely different movie drenched in lame relationship drama in a relationship you don't even buy. like when did that happen? (2 viewings)
SPOILERS
the football game betting: some of the ""priming"" was really dumb. the light fixtures in the hotel had 55 on it. did they design a new light fixture? lol. even with all that. what if he didn't look around the stadium and picked one of the first players he saw? what if Margot did that when guessing? why did he have to offer to have Margot guess? it theoretically should be just as hard for him to do it. i guess they had to have some reason to have the fat dude on the field, because there really isn't any other reason for that part of the plan. i know they ""primed"" him with a pic of the guy, but that really wasn't necessary. and she asks him what if he picked someone else, which is exactly what i was thinking, and the explanation was that he would keep going double or nothing until he picked him. but what the guy stopped after the first or second time because it would be getting out of hand and hard to trust that he would get paid. it's really dumb. also, what if will smith didn't lose all of those other early bets to get the double or nothing so high. it's madness the final scene: what if the bad guy didn't leave right away?????????? also, i dunno if i'm missing something, but wouldn't a better plan have been to run, rather than the whole confrontation and getting shot? i think there is a lot move that i am missing, this movie just hopes you won't think about it"

",2019-06-12 00:00:00,6,"Focus (2015)Plot In A Paragraph: Nicky (Smith) is a con artist whose role is decieving people for a living but when he meets a young aspiring con artist named Jesse (Margot Robbie) and takes her under his wing.This movie is dull, flat and uninspired and for someone so charismatic, Will Smith is surprisingly subdued!! Margot Robbie is very attractive and can act whilst Gerald McRaney is suitably intimidating.Focus grossed $53 million at the domestic box office, to end 2015 as the 55th highest grossing movie of the year."
" Better then expected
",2019-06-06 00:00:00,8,I liked the acting in this film better then I thought I would; they have a surprisingly good chemistry that I didnt see in Suicide Squad. Pretty good twists and just the right of excitement for a film that is easy watching in the best way

",2019-03-31 00:00:00,3,"I like WIll Smith as an actor, however I don't like the concept of this movie.
The most hateful thing, is that promote crime by making it look attractive.
Make a thief look like a magician.
In reallity those people are the worst part of the society, and their activity left behind only sorrow. The victims loose often irreplaceable belogings useless for the thiefs."
" A well-behaved burglar film
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,6,"A well-behaved burglar film. Why do these movies always turn the plot upside down now? A good plot turns into a joke in the flip. The first half is good, especially in the stadium, the paving, development and acting skills are very good. But after that, it's getting more and more fake."
" original, playful, overall a fun watch
",2019-02-17 00:00:00,10,"This is nothing but a casual review
from a subjective view point, the aesthetic is just so so amazing.
love the concept and the execution.
the plot, and the twists. make a good first viewing.
the magic dont work so much during second watch tho.
like a fine wine, keep it on the shelf for a few years, take it out when you forgot how it tastes.
will smith is hot, margot robbie is hot, the story is clever and charming, what more could you ask for?"
" Not upto the mark
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,6,"Was going with 5, but had to give a extra star for Will.
Watched it; expecting a Con/Heist movie like Oceans, but ended up getting Tom Cruise Rom-Com movie"
" Horrible
",2018-12-25 00:00:00,1,"There isn't much to say about this movie. You can see how weak it is early on. The characters are shallow, no charisma with a romance that doesn't really add up. The plot is so predictable. It's so horrible that when it tries to be funny you simply don't wanna laugh. I really don't get why they make this kind of low quality movies. The only regret is that I continued watching till the end."
" Kinda Boring
",2018-12-22 00:00:00,4,Good Actors and Storyidea but I looked forward to the ending after 30min.
" a professional con
",2018-11-18 00:00:00,10,Review: I loved this movie because it shows you whether good nor with the right mentor you can go far. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Just watch it
",2018-11-02 00:00:00,9,"I decided to write my first review because I'm absolutely shocked by the most of reviews here. People are just trying to find shortcomings in a totally charming and captivating movie.
The plot gives you a lot to think about while the whole film gives you this feeling of pure joy. The vibe between the lead actors is something that needs to be highlighted. Must watch."
" Better than average
",2018-10-19 00:00:00,8,"""Focus"" tells the story of a young man who makes his living as a trickster, catapulting himself into a world of luxury and glamour. When he meets a beautiful young lady, things begin to get a bit hot with serious trouble awaiting him.I actually like the atmosphere of this movie. It combines the nonchalant vibe of the genre with a very professional and clean look. Unlike other reviewers, for me the film is above average and sticks out between the many forgetable Hollywood blockbusters. It caught me by surprise witha few clever twists and made me want to watch until the bitter end. It is of course not a game changer or something never seen before but it is very well made for what it is.All in all I can undoubtedly reccomend a watch. If you're looking for some easy entertainment for an evening's or afternoon's watch, this is by any means a great choice."

" CONGRATULATIONS. YOU'RE A CRIMINAL
",2018-09-25 00:00:00,6,"Nicky (Will Smith) is a big time scam artist who scams people by second nature. He recruits Jess (Margot Robbie) a pick pocket to help him fleece the crowd in New Orleans during a football event. Afterwards the part after being intimate and end up running a scam involving an algorithm for race cars.The beginning of the film was fun and light. It involved slight of hand and scams and I felt like I was watching ""Now You See It."" However once we get into the race car scam, the film becomes boring as we wait for final scam to happen and perhaps the film to return to its lighter self. Unfortunately the film doesn't recover.Adrian Martinez stole every scene he was in. Kudos.Guide: F-bomb. Sex. No nudity."
" Boy, Bye!
",2018-08-29 00:00:00,1,Saw this movie once in 2015. Twice in 2016. Once in 2017. Once in 2018. Now I can drop this review.Seeing it for the fifth time was torture. I got hungry and hungrier and the hungriest in the world. I was conned. Please I need those five times back. I'm giving you guys a 1 star rating because of APPLE. Or maybe I'm being conned or I want to con you into believing that you're worth a 1 star rating.I'm hungry...I need smoothie to flush this con off...
" Amazing
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,10,"This movie is all very true and helpful. I have never given a movie ten stars before, but this movie blew me away with their mind games. The acting is great to with amazing actors."
" Focus a lot
",2018-05-22 00:00:00,7,Profoundly amazing movie.. Must watch for god time.. Either you will be on side you like the movie.. or you will think its overrated.. But for me its decent movie.. with few laughs. If you like my review give me thumbs up.
" Decent but forgettable con movie
",2018-05-04 00:00:00,7,"This was pretty good but not great, honestly pretty forgettable. A few funny bits mostly thanks to Adrian Martinez but I wouldn't call this a comedy as its labelled. Will Smith plays a con artist who takes on Margot Robbie as an inexperienced apprentice and then struggles to keep his eye on the prize after he develops romantic feelings for her. I liked Will Smith in this, he down plays his over the top Will Smithyness taking a more serious approach to his charcter. His chemistry with Margot Robbie is mediocre even though I felt like they were trying to set up a George Clooney/J-Lo sort of thing like in Out Of Sight but missing the fireworks. The locations added significantly to this and you're never really sure who is playing who. The scams are big and over complicated though -honestly that one at the football game with BD Wong had way too many variables to work. Decent back up cast especially with Martinez and Wong and a surprise appearance from Robert Taylor of Longmire who keeps his Aussie accent. Nice."
" Has its moments, but...
",2018-04-24 00:00:00,6,"Starts well, but the movie, as previous reviewers have commented, is both too long and its plot seemingly too convoluted to maintain audience interest. An expert job of scissoring would have saved the day, but this does not occur. The movie goes on and on and on along a familiar track that yields only one or two mild surprises. Fortunately, Margot Robbie is not only super-beautiful but turns in an excellent performance. Unfortunately, the same could not be said of Will Smith who way out-stays his welcome."
" Great actors, terrible movie
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,1,"Will Smith and Margot Robbie (and all the supporting actors) do a great job with what they are given. These are talented actors for sure, as they managed to keep me watching all the way to the end of this awful movie.The problems:
Main characters are fairly one-dimensional and unbelievableThe first half of the movie has nothing to do with the second half other than a couple minor references. There is no coherent story arc, just the flat, under-developed love interest.I suggest watching 'The Score' instead."
" Almost hits the bulls!
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,7,"The idea of the movie is good enough. It is unique and fresh from the oven. How they implemented the theory of sociology and psychology and such things, it is awesome. But, my concern is, if this movie wants to tell people that there are really theories of human behaviour about all of it, why don't expose them much more?
At the beginning until middle of the movies, it is very interesting. But, nearly end of the story, it becomes anti-climax. I'm dissapointed with the presentation of the ''final mission'' which i think done really mediocrity. The only thing helps this film up at the end is the third party which almost unpredictable. 
It was going to be a very good movie, but the ending is not good enough. Almost hits the bulls!"
" Un-Focus
",2018-01-27 00:00:00,5,"This movie will totally make you... unfocused! You might watch the trailer and think: it doesn't look bad, I will give it a try! This is a perfect example of deception. You expect one thing, and you get another, specially if you read the plot summary!! Don't do that, because you will already know half of the movie!! That is what happened to me, I watched the trailer and then read the summary, boy was it a big mistake! While I was watching the movie I was like, when is the thing of the summary happening? Hello! Way half the movie! So if you read it you can skip the first half of the film!! Or you can read mine, which is minute 1 in the movie and find the rest for yourself! Ah! Either way, you will feel like, uh? Where is the plot!!???Yes, fresh Prince of Bel-Air is in there, but sorry, Mr Smith has been going down since After Earth, really a pity, but he is still a box office caller... So the film might earn some money, specially as the first viewers go to watch it, but then, it will go downwards faster than you can say Grey!! In the film there is al Margot big bad Wolf Street Wolf Robbie, not a bad actress, but she will need something better to show how well an actress she is.Save yourself some money and go to the zoo! Watching the monkeys sleep will be a better entertainment than watching this movie. BANANA!"
" Focus

" Will Smith being Will Smith again
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,6,"There are no truly original heist/con movies left. Not any more, not ever again. But seeing Will Smith be Will Smith again (finally)? That was fun. Here's to fewer alien fighters and more real characters moving forward, Will. That's what movie stardom should look like. Hopefully next time you have a more original story to go with it."
" Margot Robbie Is The Best Thing In It
",2017-12-19 00:00:00,6,"Continuing my plan to watch every Will Smith movie in order I come to Focus (2015)Plot In A Paragraph: Nicky (Smith) is a con artist whose role is decieving people for a living but when he meets a young aspiring con artist named Jesse (Margot Robbie) and takes her under his wing. This movie is dull, flat and uninspired and for someone so charismatic, Will Smith is surprisingly subdued!! Margot Robbie is very attractive and can act whilst Gerald McRaney is suitably intimidating. Focus grossed $53 million at the domestic box office, to end 2015 as the 55th highest grossing movie of the year."
" Second half fails
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,6,"Focus What a shame. The first half of this flick is actually entertaining and fun. The mid-movie climax should have been the final climax. Or they should have just built the film around taking down the big mid-flick mark. Whatever, the only thing that matters is that the film is entertaining, which it is. But like I said before, the second half of the film does disappoint and fall flat, just to set up some stupid twist that nobody cares about. 6/10"
" Stylish and fun, however Margot Robbie ruined the second half.
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,7,"I would of rated the film a 9 if it just continued in the first half as a good, flashy, stylish and intelligent film but the second half then turned the film into another horrible Mr And Mrs Smith all because of Margot Robbie and Will Smith's romance. I was cautious about rating this film as high as I did at first, but then I decided that I would because the first half was so good, but the second half was a real stinker and deserved a 5. The film had so much potential at the start but then just slipped off the rails, I guess, and I never actually thought that I could of felt this way for a movie before. The cinematography could of also been a lot better, but because the editing is so good, the humour is funny and the fact that the first half was genius I think I will say that I enjoyed this. Watch the first half of the film, then imagine up a second half, no need for a long review."
" Vapid
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,4,"This is almost a chick flick. Probably few good things: the acting of Gerald McRaney and the sexy curves and beautiful eyes of Margot Robbie. But that doesn't redeem the movie, the plot is silly and if there are any surprises, they are mild and in the end the movie leaves you with nothing to remember it for. It's just one of those very forgettable romantic comedies. If you like those and are satisfied with low-key entertainment then it's fine. But f you're looking for more than this is not your movie."
" For a film called 'Focus' it's a little blurred
",2017-05-25 00:00:00,7,"Okay, I'll admit one of my main reasons for watching 'Focus' is because I saw Will Smith and Margot Robbie in 'Suicide Squad' and thought they were the best part about it. It was only then that I found out they'd already starred together in a crime-caper and, based on their super-villain chemistry, thought it would probably be worth a watch. And I was pleasantly surprisedÂ… to begin with.Smith plays a suave conman who stumbles on a not-so-suave conwoman, played by Robbie. However, she is endearing to him enough for him to feel like he needs to take her under his wing and teach her to refine her scamming ways in order to keep her out from the law's reach just that little bit longer. Luckily for him (and the speed of the narrative!) she takes to it pretty quickly and in a matter of seconds (well, 'screen-time' seconds anyway!) she's as much of a pro as he is. And so, he inducts her into his gang and off they go scamming people during a big festival-type event.And I was quite enjoying this. Yes, you do kind of have to leave the fact that, despite their charming exteriors and witty quips, these are criminals and although it's quite fun and cool to watch them 'work' we'd most likely be a little less tolerant if one of them lifted our camera while they pretended to ask for directions in a crowded public place. Anyway, it was fun seeing them scam â€“ even if it does serve as a warning to watch out for these types of people and the tricks of their trade which allow them to operate.However, about a third of the way through the film everything changes. The group goes their separate ways after their major scam is complete. After this, everything sort of slows down. There's only really one storyline going on which â€“ obviously â€“ centres on our two attractive leads and the single scam that's now taking place. It was about this time that I stopped watching intently and enjoying the light-hearted caper and had that burning desire to check my emails on my phone. That's what happens to the plot â€“ it sort of drifts away from you and you stop really paying attention. I think I may have checked Instagram once or twice during the second act and I'm pretty certain that I didn't miss much. It becomes the sort of film where you can quite easily nip out for a cup of tea and you won't really have missed anything vital.Overall, 'Focus' isn't a bad film. I really enjoyed the first half and the chemistry and coolness-factor of the two leads just about took me through the rest of it. I'm not sure how often I'd bother watching it again. I could probably go many years before really bothering to invest another couple of hours on this one. Definitely one of those films where you're better off watching it for free on one of the internet's 'streaming' services rather than buying the Blu-ray at full price.The first half I'd rate 7/10 and the second half just 6/10, but overall I'm feeling generous!"
" Not the film it's made out to be
",2017-05-19 00:00:00,4,"'Focus' looks and sounds way more interesting than it actually is. From the title and synopsis to its stylish posters, everything suggests a cool, fresh and different film. In reality, it's pretty average. The plot fell well short of my expectations and Will Smith looks as uninvolved in this film as I think I've ever seen him.This title of this movie is quite ironic given that I found my mind wondering on more than one occasion. Any decent film should be able to hold your attention for a couple of hours, but 'Focus' fails to do that, no thanks to an underwhelming plot and unsatisfying ending. All in all, it's not the film it's made out to be. 'Focus' is disappointing and forgettable."
" Focus actor
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,8,"I really would like to give you my review about the part BD Wong played in the movie Focus, and I hope you will place it on IMDb.com for everybody to read.As a partly Surinam/partly Dutch 50 year old woman and absolute filmfan, living in the Netherlands, I have seen quite a lot of movies, mainstream or not, documentary, art-house movies, it doesn't matter, I find almost everything interesting. Two years ago, 2015, I've seen about 300 movies, if not more . . .In the movie ""Focus"" all elements were superb : the script, the actors, the director, the cameracrew and the music. It was one big, beautiful symphony, like perfectly braided hair.AND in particular, I have never â€“ and I mean NEVER EVER â€“ seen a greater star shine in his role than BD Wong did in the movie ""Focus""!!! He plays a dandy, deadserious yet humorous Asian gambler, a business man with too much money to spend , too much free time apparently to spend it, and nobody to stop him from acting like a child when he doesn't get what he wants and setting him straight when crossing the line.I say BD Wong outplayed everybody in this movie, even Will Smith and Margot Robbie, who acted great also and shared some sort of rare chemistry, seldom seen, like between Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper. But BD Wong outshines them all. I mean, he got his 15 minutes to play and by God, did he play! He deserves an Oscar for this role because you don't see BD Wong, but you see only his character, Liyuan, and I think not even the script writers Glenn Ficarra and John Requa could have dreamt of a better performer than actor BD Wong for this small yet utterly well played part. (together with a defining good choice of music and camera shooting angles). In Holland (and France), when somebody excels so greatly, we say ""Chapeau!"". So here's to my new movie hero, whose beautiful voice I also LOVED in ""Mulan"", mister BD Wong : Chapeau!"
" Leave it in his Will
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,1,"Smith is DOA and the writers don't even know Flip in this under-cooked caper that belongs in a jar with other seldom seen condiments. Every attempt to extract any chemistry from the leads (Smith and Robbie) puts out all the heat you might expect from a post grad party at a rural casino. She may yet eek out a career, but his is shot. The mixture is just foolish. Reviews require ten lines of text. Here come four more:....... ....... ...... ...... ....... ......... ........ ........ .... ...... ......... .......... ............ ............... .......... ....... .......... ......... ........ .......... ......... .......etc."
" Horrible
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,1,"I never write on the internet, and yet, here I am. The movie is simply horrible, tacky and terrible acting. Don't even bother. According to the guidelines, my review does not contain enough lines, as the minimum length for reviews is ten lines of text. The problem is, there's nothing more to say. Acting is crap, story line is crap, casting is crap, everything is so far fetch... typical American movie where everything can happen. This is simply not realistic and not interesting at all. I'm so happy I didn't pay to see that movie now available on Netflix. The movie was so boring that I even took the time to look at tomorrow's weather on the weather network. Seriously, don't watch. It is simply not worth it. Here's my ten lines..."
" Not bad, but just tries too be too much, too important for its own good
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,4,"""Focus"" is an American 100-minute movie from 2015, so by now it is two years old. It was written by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, a duo of filmmakers who have collaborated for a really long time and this resulted in some good and some not so good works apparently. I guess this one here is somewhere in-between, maybe closer to the ""not so good"". It features Will Smith and Margot Robbie as the lead actors and while both are really big names, I still don't see that great talent in both of them, especially Robbie. They aren't bad actors, but they are also far from convincing unfortunately when their characters require true range and depth and they can only partially make up for these shortcomings with their great deal of charisma. Then again, they fit nicely in here because this movie (and the script in particular) are also about make-believe. The two filmmakers I mentioned earlier definitely need a lesson in subtlety. There are many many scenes and moments, and eventually the entire film, where they go way over the top and not in a good way at all. The first meeting between the two protagonists is a good example. Yes they want to depict that teacher-student relationship and show us how skilled Smith's character is, but all those tricks, all that he steals from her is just too much. Half of the items would really have been enough. This is a bit of shame as the ""angry boyfriend"" scene before that was actually not too bad. And there are more food scenes like the one with BD Wong (he gave a nice supporting performance and is probably among Asia's best in Hollywood right now), which was somewhat fun to see and the best thing is you don't even have to care about American Football to appreciate it because I sure don't.But these bright moments are quickly made up for and the negative element wins eventually. It's all so pompous, pseudo-intelligent and exaggerated that it's almost impossible to appreciate the film as a whole. Robbie and Smith are just means for the story and they also do not manage to elevate the script. The weakest moment of the film is probably the ending. I was tempted to give it a better rating before that final scene with Smith's character's father, but let's be honest here. A dad who shoots his son in the chest (even with the medical justification) is just too much and this is where the film really loses it all and hits rock-bottom. I guess you can check this one out if you really care a lot about the world of con men, but it is still not a satisfying take and elaboration on the subject either. So maybe only check it out if you are a huge Smith and/or Robbie fan. Otherwise skip it and you are not missing much, especially not in terms of realism and fraud as the biggest trick pulled off in here was to make audiences believe this is actually a convincing work. Thumbs down."
