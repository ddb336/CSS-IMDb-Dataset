" You will need to watch it until the end why the title of the movie is ""The Choice""
",2021-03-29 00:00:00,9,"Surprisingly good plot. Original and real love throughout, certainly the last 20 minutes, the script.I'm not a Romantic movie's lover and it takes a lot to feel emotionally touched.You can count the Romantic movies I love on one hand and I'm only writing a review if that touch is still there seeing it a couple of years later again.No spoilers in my reviews, you have to see it and judge for yourself.Sure some minor details could have been better, if not, it deserved a 10/10. But why complain only about that, as some critics do, when the messaged is so clear and in total the film moves you.You will for sure not regret seeing it (again)"
" Loved it!
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,10,"I really don't understand what all the hate is about, this was a great movie! I laughed, I cried out of joy and out of sadnesses and I thought the actors were perfect for the roles. They were believable and heartfelt performances.
I highly recommend for all hopeless romantics like me."
" Predictable but it's a good movie
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,6,"To a certain extent, this is an unpredictable movie in it being predictable. It's a predictable movie in the sense that, a guy meets girl, girl act hard to get but finally fall in love, they split, tragedy and happy ending. It's unpredictable in the sense that the events of the meet, the falling in love and the happy ending, comes at unexpected scenes.In Overall it's good movie that will put a smile on your face."
" Don't Even Flick Through It
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,1,"Warning other people that this thing is utter crap is the only good thing about it. Don't even flick through it to confirm that it's crap. It's like a bad wedding video.
I do wish that IMDB would go back to the old system, where one could automatically view the ""bad"" reviews first. They always give much more information and are the place to start, even with your favorite movies. Now I have to use 3 clicks, and waste lots of electrical energy in data centers, to get to the real reviews that aren't written by bots or shills."
" Even though this film was quite predictable
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,8,"I found the journey delightful. And let's be fair, it isn't easy choosing between Superman and Travis and one of several questions raised is whether the latter's southern charm and wit will win through in the end. And of course the journey's not going to be a smooth one and it is advisable to have plenty of paper tissues handy for the last 20 minutes or so.
While the leads were charming, the supporting cast were also excellent. In all, a lovely film that is perfect for a romantic occasion."
" No chemistry and bad acting
",2020-12-22 00:00:00,2,"I couldn't stand the characters of the main protagonists and the story was super cheesy, plain and predictable. On top of that, the acting was very bad. Sometimes I needed to look away from the screen as it got too embarrassing. I have no idea how this movie could get a rating of 6.6. Probably because of all the 10 star upvotes from 12 year old girls who like such a cheesy non-sense."
" It goes on and then it goes ... on again
",2020-12-06 00:00:00,1,"It seemed to go on for hours and hours; unremittingly lacking in charm. A very unlovely love story.From reading other reviews, it seems like the Nicholas Sparks standard recipe is to throw in all sorts of events in the hope of eliciting an emotional response from the reader/audience. But there wasn't a single character I found myself able to care about, so it didn't really matter what was thrown at them or how bravely they responded to events."
" No way
",2020-11-17 00:00:00,2,"Chick flick and I was expecting it but nowhere near the vicinity of The Notebook as others suggest. Quite corny actually. Acting is a bit cheesy too, so in a nutshell =disappointed. Puppies were cute though."
" Horrible
",2020-09-22 00:00:00,1,"One of the worst ever, so bad it's fun! Poor acting, texts a joke, details make you laugh. And, she wakes up in the end!"
" If you love romance Than ...
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,8,"My hopeless romantic heart always falls in love with a Nicolas Sparks novel and when made into a movie better yet.Typical playground 101 Travis. Gabby is a young girl chasing a dream to be a doctor, Travis is a local vet who owns a house right beside the ocean and right beside the cottage Gabby is renting.It isn't love at first sight.. and it is love slipping away. Will they find each other again? Or will they let it slide away?"
" Heartwarming
",2020-09-02 00:00:00,9,A feel-good film not original in content but a great under-rated romantic film. I would recommend a watch
" ""Welcome to my stud farm""!
",2020-08-18 00:00:00,1,"Would probably be a much better title! In the opening 10 minutes ""Travis"" has several women, then the one from ""next door"" appears with an accusation about his dog getting her dog pregnant, queue the arrival of another woman who clearly intends to spend the night with Travis.....Apart from the actors aweful accent this isnt the opening sequence to a movie that I would be inclined to refer to as entertainment. We got no further than 15 minutes. So much for the idea of a nice couple of hours watching a highly recommended film....OFF Switch! this isnt for folk who live an ordinary existence an a normal neighbourhood to see a ""stud"" who has his own luxury place and a boat and women falling over themselves to get into his bed!"
" Just laughed all the way though
",2020-07-30 00:00:00,2,"This is supposed to be a ""tearjerker"" according to Netflix, but I ended up laughing for most of it. Why?Because of the unbelievably bad and cringy dialogue and the awful directing choices. I usually love watching chick flicks and romantic dramas and I'm no stranger to crying if it gets emotional, I was shattered after ""The Notebook"" for instance. But this movie didn't offer a single moment where I felt anything but amusement and slight embarrassment.The main actors have no chemistry and when they speak lovingly to each other you don't believe a word of it. The plot is predictable, to say the least...But I still enjoyed the experience. Not because it's a good film, it really isn't, but because sometimes is fun to watch something that is so bad you end up shouting at the screen, even if you're home alone. So, if you fancy having fun like that, I totally recommend The Choice."
" Thank you Reviewers, the 10 star rating is for you, not the Movie.
",2020-07-03 00:00:00,10,"I can't tell you how much I appreciate the user reviews on IMBD. They have saved me from wasting both money and my time.
I nearly spent $3.99 to watch this on prime. I was looking for a feel-good movie to watch because I suffer from Chronic pain. So much that right now I feel pretty irritable. I can tell from your honest reviews that I probably would have ended up completely agitated and with exacerbated pain. I hate movies that are contrived. I find them insulting. A special thanks to the reviewer who commented on the part where the main character receives a marriage proposal that she does not wish to accept and no one will hear her ""no"" and that instead, her family coerces her and tells her that her own feelings were wrong. I grew up in a family like that. My mother constantly telling me ""Nida, you do not feel that way "". ""You are not depressed"". . .just reading that got me triggered, so thanks for the warning, dear reviewer"
" Classic feel good with a weird ending
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,4,"The movie begins with a cute story that build up in a good way, but after the 1 hour mark the movie is rushed and there are plotlines that are started that should not have been there. Over all it feels like it had potential but due to the rushed storyline it is a 4 star for me"
" Memorable
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,5,This was another movie on the list of romantic movies to watch from my good friends list when growing up.This was definitely heartfelt and pulled at the emotional strings here and there.
" Too long and too boring!
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,2,This is one of the most boring movies I've seen in my life. It was a waste of time.
" Nice
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,8,A Nice movie. Actings very good. History very good
" Horrible
",2020-03-03 00:00:00,1,"Terrible movie. I dont know which character is worse, travis or gabby."
" ""The world breaks everyone... But those that will not break it kills.""
",2020-02-16 00:00:00,10,"This movie touched so many chords with me. The thinking about where on earth you were when someone you love is taken, what you were doing, how you were absent when they needed you most. I know it because I wasn't there for Dad and I still think that to this day. The world kills those you love and breaks you as you survive them. The perennial tragedy."
" Ten handkerchiefs ❤
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,10,"Omg - this one topps ""p.s.I love you"" and it takes a lot to do that ❤❤❤"
" Torturous remark of the Notebook
",2020-01-26 00:00:00,4,"This movie was literal torture to watch that I actually had to quit it. It's a redundant version of the Notebook and basically a ""type casted"" version of a story (rather than an actor) by Nicolas Sparks. Can he ever not write a story like this?? It's overdone. Seriously. Even all the movies his books were turned into have the same cover photos! Even the characters of this movie are exactly the same as those of the Notebook.... the way Gabby speaks, her phrases, her tone. I just can't."
" Love it
",2020-01-17 00:00:00,10,I loved everything about this movie!!!!! I cant believe it took me a long time to see it.
" Awful acting & zero chemistry
",2020-01-16 00:00:00,1,"Oh dear what a letdown. The acting was so bad & they had zero chemistry! Why you would choose Travis over that hunk Ryan I don't know! And were most wearing a bad wig?? I was glad she was in a coma for so long so I got a break from her awkward overacting. Only
plus was the beautiful scenery! Give it a miss!"
" Incredibly good
",2019-11-30 00:00:00,10,"Say what you will, but this movie steals your heart and shows you what real love looks like it's full of joy AMD love and funny and sweet people"
" I EXPECTED MORE
",2019-11-12 00:00:00,5,"I loved the book. I have never been the person to read any type of book but I had to read at least one for the week and it caught my attention. The book was magical and it made me ( a person who doesn't like reading) read!! The movie was very dull and it didn't include everything from the book that made it so good. So many things were left out from the book so I recommend reading the book instead because the movie was disappointing. I had high hopes for this movie. I love the book and it is by far the best book I have EVER read ( considering I don't read) so yeah. Do what you will with this information. (Also I love Teresa Palmer, A Discovery Of Witches is a really good show!!! go check it out!!)"
" Another Nicholas Sparks adaption
",2019-10-10 00:00:00,6,"One of the weaker Nicholas sparks adaptations, also one that is easily mixed up with all of the (11) other movies as there's nothing too stand out here. This time we follow the relationship between a med student and a charming vet over the course of a decade as they try to decide what they want out of life and what is important to them.It's beautifully filmed wherever it is they always shoot these movies with lots of water, beaches, boats, rain, birds, and sunsets. There's love, sadness, happiness, a bit of mystery and ultimate tearjerking. Its your formulaic Nicholas Sparks but you know that going in.Benjamin Walker as the main dude is cute but unremarkable, Teresa Palmer just reminded me of Kristen Stewart. Couple things that annoyed me; this has a ""7 years later"" thing take place but none of the characters change whatsoever in that time. Children are born, but everyone is exactly the same as the last scene. I mean at least alter their hair a bit. Enjoyed the dogs, although the puppies used were not golden retriever puppies or puppies at all just some small breed of dog."
" Definitely a good watch
",2019-07-21 00:00:00,10,"I was a little sceptical of this movie at the start, however after watching it completely I was pleasantly surprised by this film it was truly great. I would certainly reccomend this movie."
" It's worth a watch
",2019-07-16 00:00:00,4,"I love Nicholas Sparks older books. A Bend in The Road, The Rescue, True Believer. I will still read/watch his newer ones but not the same!
The Choice movie highlights too much on sexual attraction and less on a deep emotionally mature relationship between the 2 main characters. Nicholas writes this well it just did not translate to the movie."
" Okay movie acting kinda off
",2019-04-23 00:00:00,5,The main girls acting wasn't the greatest and I would get cringy at some scenes.. but cute typical story of girl next door.
" English Review
",2019-03-29 00:00:00,10,"Do you believe in fate, or something just happening in the spur of the moment? By asking this question, this book proves fate does happen. An unexpected love sparked between two totally opposite characters. Gabbie Hollands, a medical student that's in a long term relationship ready to settle down, and Travis Shaw, known as a ""lady's man"". This isn't a typical romance movie, this has so many different things compared to any other movies. They fall in love with a different path, that leaves you crying and laughing by the end. This heartbreaking love story will leave you wanting to watch it again and again. I recommend this movie because the way the characters talk about being with each other, and their choice. The choice. The choice leading them to where they are now. It motivates you to want to fall in love, they way they did. With all the laughter, smiles, adventures, stories...everything. It leaves you an undying love for well....love.
This movie is about Gabbie Holland (medical student) and Travis Shaw (lady's man), neighbors, and just two people who got off on the wrong foot. Every choice they make, leads them to such a bigger experience than expected. The unfathomable adventures and the undying love that forms between them. Gabbie's boyfriend went out of town for a job trip and Travis and her started hanging out more. Soon it led to a new storyline and happy but also very sad moments."
" Very enjoyable
",2019-02-17 00:00:00,8,"I am always boggled by people giving bad reviews to romance movies that follow the formula for romance movies. Boy and girl meet, have some issues, resolve the issues, fall in love, a complication arises but it's eventually over come and happily ever after is finally achieved. This is the formula and for many of us that is all we need or want. We don't want too dark or complex, we don't want too much raunch, we don't want cerebral character interaction and we don't want it to be too different or clever. We just want an enjoyable romance movie that is well acted with some humour, some pathos and some heart. I watched The Choice not expecting anything more than a romance movie and that is what it is. The acting was uni-formally good, the scenery sublime, the characters very likable but not perfect and it moved me to tears in a few scenes. Predictable and cliche, sure, but very enjoyable even so."
" Really ..
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,4,Giving birth to seven week old puppy's or are they grown chi his hua's... and other sort of vet nonsense. I could not watch it anymore.
" Very, very slow
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,6,"I have now watched a couple of films from Nicholas Sparks' novels mainly because my daughter loves his books. I also wanted to watch this because Teresa Palmer was in it.I don't know what it is about these films, but they are so slow. Frankly I tend to fall asleep during them. The plots are always rather sketchy on detail and to be honest the endings are somewhat unsatisfactory.If you want to while away a couple of hours watching I leave it to your discretion. The scenery is nice and the dogs are cute."
" ""...some choices change everything...""
",2019-01-04 00:00:00,7,"In the opening scenes of this film we see Travis (Walker) mulling over an unknown choice he has to make, en route to hospital, flowers in hand. Most of the film depicts the events leading up to this point.Now, I stumbled on this film by idly setting it to record on a PVR (without knowing the slightest thing about it) and then watching it later on. To be honest when I usually do this, it is about 50:50 whether I bother to watch it at all; quite a few films get deleted without ever being seen all the way through; this percentage goes right up if it is what might be termed a 'chick flick' of merely average quality. However in this case, right from the start, I thought this was a well-crafted film, beautifully photographed and with a good soundtrack. I won't say I was hooked but I was sufficiently intrigued to watch it all the way through and to my surprise I was rather moved by it.So my advice is that you should start watching this film with no prior knowledge and no expectations whatsoever; however if you are reading this it may already be too late, you may have already been told the main plot points, that the movie is terribly formulaic, yada yada yada. Too bad; watching a film is all about suspension of disbelief; this film is no different to most in that respect, and I'd argue that this one is best approached with almost no prior knowledge or expectations of any kind.Maybe one or two expectations are OK; that of the North Carolina coastline being beautifully photographed as a backdrop to this film, and a nice soundtrack, not too much in your face. All movies paint a certain, usually somewhat unrealistic, view of reality, and this film is no exception; for example I don't think the coastline is ever filmed at low tide, when it is somewhat less, er, photogenic. The whole film is arguably similarly rendered, which hardly unusual and is the storyteller's prerogative, even though some folk might object to it.Maybe if you are a chap who wants a movie to settle down and watch one evening in the company of a significant other, this would be a good choice; with too much prior knowledge (and a cynical head on) it would be easy to dismiss it as formulaic and schmaltzy, but if you are in the right mood this is a heartwarming, life-affirming story, nicely told. If I'd read half the reviews on here beforehand I probably wouldn't have bothered to watch this film at all, but I didn't and I judged it on its own merits, and to my great surprise it gets seven out of ten from me."
" So unrealistic
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,2,"At first I gave it a 4. But there are so many annoying mistakes in the movie. Thinking your dog is pregnant from the neighbors dog, 3 days after you moved to your new home. A retriver giving birth to, at least 8 weeks old, chihuahua puppies. A woman who can talk and walk like she had a nap for 20 minutes, after being on a ventilator, in a coma for god knows how long. And then there is the acting of Teresa Palmer , wow, and the script. nerveracking. The 2 is for the scene in the kitchen (with perfect music) and the acting of Benjamin Walker."
" Great movie
",2018-12-05 00:00:00,8,Excellent movie! I felt feeling I haven't felt in a long time.
" The Choice
",2018-11-02 00:00:00,10,"Main characters: Teresa Palmer (as Gabby Holland), Benjamin Walker (as Travis Parker), Maggie Grace (as Stephanie Parker)
Director: Ross Katz
Year released: 2016
Time and place (in movie): 21 century North Carolina
Genre: drama/romanticSummary (SPOILER ALERT): the movie ""The choice"" is about a girl named Gabby and a boy named Travis. Travis lives in North Carolina and Gabby just moved next-door because of her Study. Gabby has a boyfriend and finds Travis very annoying at the beginning. Later her boyfriend goes away for a few days and she was warming up to Travis so they decided to eat dinner together and from then they were sort of a thing. But Gabby's boyfriend came back and she didn't know what to do. Travis was heartbroken because he fell in love with her. She later broke up with her boyfriend and Travis found out when her boyfriend gave him a punch in the face, so Travis immediately went up to Gabby's parents house, totally unprepared and without a ring (which he later did get from her mother when he was at the house) , he asked her to marry him. She said yes (after 3 no's). they got married, had kids and lived happily ever after until Gabby got in a car accident and got into a coma. He nearly had to make the decision to shut off the device that kept her alive, when she just woke up and then they really lived happily ever after.My opinion: I liked the movie because it really drags you with it. I didn't find it that predictable and it also wasn't badly acted. It has a lot of dramatic twist in the movie like when she just suddenly got hit by a car and I am a fan of dramatic and romantic movies so that's great about the movie.Recommendation: overall I thought it was a really good movie because everything was well thought of like background music, location of shooting and the actors really fit the part. That's why I give this movie 5 stars and if it were possible more because this movie has been my all time favourite for a long time now, and I think it doesn't get enough credit."
" Spoiled for Choice.
",2018-10-24 00:00:00,3,"With very little chemistry between Palmer and Walker, a story so predictable, eye roll inducing and disgustingly cliche while being quite disjointed in the process, makes The Choice a nauseating experience.There is so much that is wrong with this film, one could be spoiled for choice. It's morally questionable at best, Walker has absolutely no charm whatsoever and Palmer's cute little girl next door portrayal comes across as a girl with a head full of helium.The script is awful, the casting is arguably worse. The pacing is terrible and the love story is not believable, instead of being unbelievable.It had its good moments somewhat,here and there, like its running theme of contradictory love illustrated by Travis' proposal and Gabby's response, Travis' endearment being seemingly crude and of course, Travis and Gabby's first interaction being that of water and oil colliding. However, none of that was enough to save this movie.You cannot make a love story where one lead's love is based on cheating, and not just cheating but rather, SHAMELESS cheating furthermore, especially when the character who's being cheated on is one we like, while having the other lead being pursued by a woman that has admirable honor, who we also like. All that accomplishes, is to turn the leads into villains who get their happy ending.I really like Teresa Palmer, which is why I chose to watch this movie, but sadly, Palmer has a tendency it appears, of picking movies that seem good, but end up being like helium; tasteless and colorless.The Choice is just simply too predicable, ridiculous and disjointed, with a plot lacking integrity while you have a young Travis who believes in love and loyalty, just for him to have Gabby compromise those very qualities a few minutes later. 3.4/10."
" Not a Fan of Nicholas Sparks, But a Fan of The Choice
",2018-09-22 00:00:00,9,"I'm not a fan of Nicholas Sparks because I don't like romantic stories designed to pull your emotions like taffy in all directions. So, I watched this movie having no inkling of an idea that it was based on a Nicholas Sparks' book. It seemed like an easy, rainy, Saturday movie from the get-go. Teresa Palmer did a fabulous job of being a likable and believable character and Benjamin Walker played a role with emotional highs and lows expertly. When things started to feel like a runaway train near the end and I was afraid where everything was heading, I had to pause the movie and look it up online to see what it was about. That's when I found out the movie was based on his book. I never would have watched The Choice if I knew what it was about, but I'm pretty glad I saw this particular movie. It made for an enjoyable Saturday flick."
" Beautiful
",2018-07-21 00:00:00,8,This is one of the most beautiful romantic movies i have ever seen although the plot is not perfect
" Too much out of reality
",2018-07-03 00:00:00,6,"I don't usually dislike Nicholas Sparks' movies. Yes, they're way too cheesy and romantic... but isn't that the reason we like them?
This one though goes a bit too far. Girl meets a boy she doesn't even like and the day after she's cheating on her boyfriend with him. She also go and meet the guy's family while the aforementioned boyfriend is away on business. Boyfriend comes back, finds out everything, gets mad and leave. The day after he asks the girl to marry him. If this wasn't already unrealistic enough, the guy asks the girl to marry him too. It has been what, three weeks at most?
After all this, the second part of the movie begins. The girl and the guy are now happily married, but she gets into a car crash and consequently into a coma. The guy is left alone with his two kids and the choice whether to get her off the machines that keep her alive. In my opinion, this part is better than the first one but at that point I was expecting so many improbable events to happen that I wasn't surprised when the girl woke up (after it was said the chances were less than 1%) and with zero brain damage.
In conclusion, the story itself wasn't bad, but I would have personally widened up the time windows (e.g. made the boyfriend be away for months) and switched the marriage proposals with just forgiveness. The story would have been the same, just much more believable."
" No need to put a spoiler alert, we can predict the story ourselves
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,3,"This story is so predictable, I can't believe they took the effort making it. By the way, non-native English speaker here, is that accent of Travis even real? It seems so over the top. Plus, and this is neither here nor there, but what is up with the helmet hair of Travis? They seem to blow dry it in the same shape as Queen Elizabeth."
" Boring, Zero Chemistry
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,1,"Honestly I had high hopes for this since I enjoyed the book but I hated this movie. I feel like the main characters had no chemistry whatsoever and it felt like they had known each other for a nanosecond before Travis was adamant that he loved Gabby. At least in the book their relationship was developed more so you actually could believe they were in love. I found it hard to get past Travis' ridiculously overdone southern accent, everyone else in the movie has a relatively normal sounding accent that is believable. It sounds like a stereotypical hillbilly accent and was just so off putting. Also, when Gabby's dog has puppies, the newborn 'puppies' were clearly at least a few weeks old. Anyone who has actually seen newborn puppies know that those dogs looked nothing like they should have. With a budget of millions it's ridiculous that they couldn't find some actual newborn puppies to put in the movie. Ridiculous error aside, I thought this movie was boring and completely unbelievable. They could have spent more time on actually developing the characters and made the movie a little longer. Even my Mom who is a sucker for sappy romances and all things Nicholas Sparks thought this movie was awful. This is definiteley one of the worst renditions of a Nicholas Sparks book I've ever seen."
" Great Love Story; Even Greater Cast; But Was Something Cut?
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,10,"It's safe to say that I will love most any movie with Teresa Palmer and if it's a romantic movie; all the more so. My reason for posting this though is to see if anyone else noticed what seemed quite obvious to me. With Gabby in a coma, the dog finds her wind chime which inspires Travis to build a gazebo at their special place along the beach. I say inspired but he was more obsessed at doing this than inspired. Suddenly after completing it, the chimes begin chiming and he is off to the nursing home. We see on his phone that he has missed several calls. He gets there and finds her awake and she tells him he is late. That's it. He never explains why he is late, what he has built for her nor how that helped him continue to be positive. Surely they cut a scene at the end where he shared this information with her, no? Yes, they end the movie at the gazebo but not one word about how it came to be built or as I mentioned, what caused him to miss all of those calls. It seems such a scene would have been one of the most romantic scenes in the movie. Instead of her telling him in the backyard that she heard him while in a coma, that dialogue would have been even better had he taken her to the beach and surprised her with the gazebo and how he came to build it."
" Amazing movie <3
",2018-02-02 00:00:00,10,"Well you guys want a romantic movie that is unique, beautiful and worthy of your time, and you came here to see reviews for this movie whether to watch it or not. 
My opinion is that this movie delivers every thing you want and more. Was worth every second of my time, the acting , the story , the scenery everything was just perfect. I will give it a 10/10 and would definitely recommend this to every romance lover out there."
" SO Beautiful guys
",2018-01-08 00:00:00,10,"So Beautiful guys The beautiful Maggie Grace (Taken) plays Travis' sister,"
" The Choice
",2017-10-17 00:00:00,10,"If you are ever in the mood for some tear-jerking romance and drama, The Choice, is the movie for you. The movie is based off of the Nicholas Sparks novel, The Choice. It takes place in the most romantic setting, a small coastal town, and it is full of young love. The Choice is about a man named Travis Shaw, played by Benjamin Walker, who is a cool, easy going, and good looking man, who is currently in an ""off and on"" relationship with his high school girlfriend, but is not ready for commitment. Gabby Holland, played by Teresa Palmer, is a stubborn young medical student, with a long time boyfriend, who recently moves into the house next door to Shaw. At first the two don't get along, because of Travis's smug and egotistical nature and Gabby's fiery and stubborn mindset. However, over time the two start to grow fond of each other, and they will have to decide whether or not their love is real and if they will be together. Directed by Ross Katz, The Choice is a well acted, heart warming, romantic drama between main characters, Travis Shaw and Gabby Holland, who will have to make a decision on whether or not their love is worth fighting for. The Choice is a great movie because of its well selected cast. I think that Ross Katz, the director, along with screenplay writer, Bryan Sipe, did a great job making the film come together as a whole. They choose very talented group of actors and actresses to make the movie come to life. In the film, Benjamin Walker played the lead male role, Travis Shaw, and Teresa Palmer played the lead female role, Gabby Holland. This talented duo was able to bring out the unique personalities of their characters. They both did an amazing job at making it seem like their feelings for each other grew gradually throughout the film, and the connection between the two characters was incredible. The love they had for each other, draws the viewers in and makes them feel connected to the film. The Choice also had great drama scenes. At the beginning of the movie, you can already sense that there is tension between Travis and Gabby, and as the film progresses you can still feel the tension building between the two, even after they begin to fall in love. When things between them are at a high, Gabby and Travis will be forced to make a choice that will affect whether or not their love is worth fighting for. I think that Nicholas Sparks writing really came alive through the film. Each dramatic scene was acted and planned so perfectly that the drama that was woven into the romance of the story, putting the viewers at the edge of their seat. The Choice was also very heartwarming. Throughout the film, there is definite growth within the characters as individuals. Supporting roles like Stephanie Shaw, Travis's sister, played by Maggie Grace, and Monica, Travis's girlfriend, played by Alexandra Daddario, have important and heartwarming moments together that help to shape him into a even better man. The transformation and growth of character relationships in the film was also amazing. As the love between Travis and Gabby grow, the more intimate moments they have together. The relationship between the two is so full of love that it will touch your heart. Overall, I think that The Choice is a great movie. It has great actors that makes the movie come to life, and it is full of dramatic and heartwarming scenes. It is hands down one of my favorite movies, because I love how even though there's ups and downs in the relationship in the movie, it still somehow seems perfect. The Choice is an amazing movie for teenagers or adults, it will keep you at the edge of your seat but also touch your heart."
" Major Flaw
",2017-10-13 00:00:00,7,"OK I am a sucker for a good movie set with a lot of emotions. What I don't like and do get annoyed with is, when producers or people that make the movies take us for idiots!! I would have rated this movie higher if it not had been for some simple details. Do they really think we were born yesterday-please pay attention to detail. If I would have made a mistake or have a flaw like this in my real life job I would get fired or be let go for such mistakes. Why, well first of all puppies are not born with their eyes open, able to walk, or partially grown right after being born. Furthermore the puppies didn't even closely resemble the mother. Yes you tried to pass that off on us-pure idiocracy! Trying to get past that I liked the personality Benjamin Walker put into the role of veterinarian Travis Shaw. The movie had feeling, humor, real life tragedies, and qualities in a movie I like. Also liked the message the movie gave us on making choices. The cinematography also added to the movie which was set in coastal town in the Carolinas. All in all an enjoyable ride with a roller coaster of emotions, good on a rainy afternoon."
" Remarkable, truthful writing. Great acting
",2017-08-01 00:00:00,10,"There is nary a moment in this film where the writing let me down. The characters are beautiful and real and reflect challenges in the human condition. There is beauty and meaning in love and making life together and this file captures the important small and big moments. The acting is profound and sublime rendering a great, yet simple, screenplay to real life and emotions. I cheered and cried through it all and felt the play of real life through it all.P.S. I never write reviews,but the negatives of this film just compelled me."
" Sort of mediocre romance film
",2017-07-16 00:00:00,5,"The Choice (2016) really isn't a romantic film of very much quality. This is no Notebook, a good romance is a movie that has well defined characters, good chemistry between those well defined characters, and good dialogue to complete it all. This film is very cheesy most of the time and the acting is very very bad in certain places. The actors simply didn't sell me the majority of the time. There are a few scenes where I enjoyed the interactions between the main characters. I was disappointed though at how few times I liked the performances by the two main romantic leads. And let me just say that Tom Welling had better take a serious look at his career as an actor because his performance was abysmal in this movie. I mean it was embarrassingly bad. I actually did like Alexandra Daddario's performance though, she was good and I believed every bit of her acting. The script is entertaining and sugary sweet in some places, but most of the time it is pretty derivative and stereotypical. 5/10 for The Choice. I do not recommend this romance film for viewing."
" Awful movie (and this comes from a chick flick-lover)
",2017-07-16 00:00:00,2,"I watch chick flicks very often and I almost never care about how mealy and predictable they are. It's easy to watch and dream away with these kind of movies. Just hoping your life could be like those movies for one second. But this one didn't had me dreaming away for one second, on the contrary, it made me feel irritated, bored and frustrated all at once. To start with, it's not OK to make a whole movie about a love story that's just based on high-level cheating. It romanticizes the idea that cheating is acceptable. They make it seem like she didn't even felt bad about it. After that I didn't have any sympathy left for either of them.And if that wasn't worse enough, the movie itself was just awful. Too predictable, even for a mainstream chick flick. People are not aging at all, characters are totally not developed (it doesn't go any further than ""I act like an a**hole but i'm not"") and there is just nothing sincere when they're acting, it all seems like a joke. Even though I like Teresa, but this movie just made her look awful. Just don't waste your time, just don't. Don't let the 'Nicholas Sparks'- label fool you into thinking it'll be a good movie. It's no walk to remember, it's a movie to erase from your memory."
" Finally, a love story that brought me to tears for all the right reasons!
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,10,"I don't know why some people have to be overly critical in their reviews. This was a well written, well executed, beautiful movie about love. Just enjoy it for what it is and stop over thinking it. I'm officially a fan girl of Tessa. Benjamin Walker was romantic, believable, and what every woman wants! Finally, a love story that brought me to tears for all the right reasons! I loved it!"
" My personal Favorite from his Novels to Movies, Teresa Palmer is Outstanding
",2017-06-03 00:00:00,10,"I always really enjoy Nick Sparks novels to films, or even just the films. I have read The Lucky One, Safe Haven, Notebook, Dear John, Longest Ride, and of course ""The Choice."" I am 34 year old man that is not usually a chick flick kind of Genre person but Nicholas Sparks has a rare ability to make his love stories so authentic, and he also creates another level of something I personally can relate to in his movies, especially growing up in the area of where all these movies take place and are filmed-shot at. ""The Choice"" really grabbed a hold of me because it reminded me of a summer I had here in Myrtle Beach, SC. The feeling that Teresa Palmer is able to portray in this film is unforgettable to me, it took me back to a summer romance that just makes me have mixed emotions of incredible lifetime experiences and how Love is so rare and magical. I mean that type of Love you see instantly here in this movie when Teresa Palmer gets Travis to change his ways and fall fast into a place he would never let his heart go before, and y'all all know that its true and we all do that or have done so in our lives! If you cannot relate to their summer fling turned forever Love, than you just have never lived in my opinion! This movie made me have a great time because it made me smile, laugh, reminisce, hurt, cry, and feel all emotions of my own life experiences all bottled up into one film. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has had that summer fling whether it turned out like Travis and Gabby's or just stayed what it was and is a great memory to look back on like me, and smile saying I have no regrets! Maybe I am a bit of a hopeless romantic and realized that after watching this film a few times!"
" Morals and Ethics do not matter as long as you are 'meant to be'
",2017-05-29 00:00:00,3,"I saw this a few months back and recently I watched an older Nicholas Spark- novel - turned-movie. I must say the common human behavioral characteristics involved in his movies are one of lies, deception and unfaithfulness.This movie above is no different, Gabby is a feisty medical student and Travis is an easy going vet. Gabby already has a long term relationship with a doctor with whom she cheats on, this is justified because 'fate' has chosen this to be.This disregard for moral standards shows itself in the movie, the dialogue is very planned and almost seems unnatural for Palmer (who hides her natural accent very badly) to deliver her lines in a convincing manner, the movie tries to hide this with the usual exposing of female physique and the mid-movie romp between the main characters. Walker was a lot less convincing and overplayed his role as a Southern smooth talker and his haircut did not do him any favors there.This is your typical Nicholas Spark big screen movie...too long and too predictable."
" Predictable and errors
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,1,"I was looking for a good movie on Amazon Prime, this one had 5 stars so thought it would be pretty good. The first 15 minutes are completely predictable - like they used a romance movie template. The girl's dog, which appears to be a golden retriever and looks much too old to have puppies, is pregnant and she blames his dog. Supposedly she's only lived next door a few days. Miraculously her dog has puppies within a week or so (should have been 2 months). she desperately runs to his house for help (he's a veterinarian). He comes over to help with the birth - she disappears, then they cut back to the dog. And, imagine that - the dog had chihuahuas - yep, not even newborn ones, but ones with wide open eyes, tails wagging, and ears in the air. I'd suspect they were at least 6 months old.Had to quit watching, I'm embarrassed for the production company and director."
" Mildly Entertaining
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,6,"The latest movie adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks novel, ""The Choice"" is about two people (played by Benjamin Walker and Teresa Palmer) who seem to be of differing personalities who meet cute, start a romance, and one is going to make a choice that will affect their lives forever.So let me do a quick break down of this movie. Despite some heavy drama thrown around during the second and third acts, ""The Choice"" is basically a romantic comedy. As such, the couple ""meet cute,"" meaning they meet in a cute, funny, and interesting way. This important element is catastrophically bad in ""The Choice."" I almost cringed at the horrible dialogue when Walker and Palmer first met. Fortunately the dialogue improved somewhat in their subsequent meetings, although still at the level below what is expected of a good screenwriter.Now to the second act, where things really start to get interesting. The romance and drama get amped up, and most of the corny dialogue is replaced with slightly more serious and believable fare. But all this time, I keep thinking of the lack of chemistry between the two leads — a crucial part of any movie, especially that of a rom-com — and how Walker was miscast as the male lead. Another big strike against this movie; but as the movie goes on I started focusing more on the characters instead of how the actors looked together. Saved by the bell here.Then there's the third act, which is mostly about the choice one of the leads has to make. In order to not spoil the movie, I won't mention anything more other than it is a Nicholas Sparks story, so prepare to have your emotions played with.My most memorable, movie moment of ""The Choice"" is the scene when Walker professes his love for Palmer, telling her in his own way that he wants to be with her forever. This is the most dramatic and authentic part of the movie, filled with raw emotion without artificial sweeteners or cornball dialogue.Sparks fans will most likely have a kinder attitude to ""The Choice."" But fans of great rom-coms will be disappointed, but still mildly entertained.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
" No surprises, and Not The Notebook
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,5,"I'm only going to give away one spoiler, so if you're hoping for none, don't read this.The notebook was touching, a bit unpredictable and certainly pulled at the heart strings. The Choice not so much.It wasn't bad as some and certainly not as good as many many others. The only spoiler and first thing that ruined it for me was when the Golden Retriever gave birth to 3 chihuahuas as if they were her puppies. You couldn't borrow some retriever puppies for the shot? Really? That set the tone for me. Less and less believable. Sorry folks, this gets a generous rating of 5."
" feel the pain and Love in The choice
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,8,"The presence of Teresa Palmer & Benjamin Walker are very much pleasurable in total Movie. It was really give me a very Nostalgic feelings. The Romantic situation is seriously very much impressive. And the Director is also success to touch the viewer's emotion. The little Pregnant of Alexandra Daddario also make me pleased.. The colour, the Framing, The Location, and overall the Direction was really Mind blowing. Love it"
" The movie is great!
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,10,I have read the book before watching movie version. And I really like it. I mean there were some differences but the movie did it very well. The differences made it looked like we read new chapters of the choice. It still touched my heart though. It's short and not taking too much time to get going like in the book. Recommended!!
" It was a good movie, but not as great as I thought it would be
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,6,"It was a decent movie, but I couldn't help but compare it to The Notebook. The Notebook was definitely a better movie.The Choice had some details in it that completely drove me crazy. One of them was about the Golden Retriever that has puppies. When puppies are born, their eyes and ears are not open, they can't see or hear anything, and they are small enough that the female dog doesn't die when she gives birth. The puppies shown, ""directly after"" birth, were at least 3 months old, if not older. Their eyes and ears were open, they were alert, and they were huge, a female dog would die trying to give birth to them at that size. But the main thing about them is that they are NOT Golden Retrievers, they are Chihuahuas lol there's a HUGE difference. Just look at the ""mother dog's"" face, and then look at the puppies faces, they are shaped completely differently. With how many puppies there are in this country, you'd think that the directer and crew could've gotten off their butts and looked for puppies that match the age and breed that they're supposed to. It's really stupid that a detail that should be so little constantly came back into my brain through the whole movie.The script also bugged me. One example of it is, ""Come bother me, baby"", are you serious? There's nothing romantic about that line at all. I'd be completely turned off if a man said that to me.All in all, it's an okay movie, but it's not something I'd watch more than once. The Notebook at least is something that people actually want to watch again."
" Perfect People Defy Everything
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,4,"I must admit it is hard to resist the temptation. The scenery, the life with friends overflowing love is so good that it makes you feel like a complete total loser. Not because the people in the movie are very successful for rich or whatever. Because they are living the life that everyone secretly (or openly) desires. A wonderful house on the waterside. boats, dogs, a nice, respected job, a family presence, afternoons and weekends with friends and BBQ with loved ones. On top of all that, a perfect love. Can it get more any picturesque than that? Beneath the surface, there is nothing though. No content. ıt is just like an ad made to make you feel miserable about your own life.I love when people fall in love without ever, not once, talking about life, politics or music. When the guy that finds it hard to commit - his mother died when he was young-abandonment par excellence- suddenly becomes he most domestic male on the planet. When dogs never die. When the sunset is always incredible and when there is a secret island you can go whenever you want. When people come back from comas.I wonder how people reconcile these movies with their lives. With the bills, illnesses, heartbreaks, shitty apartments we have to live in, water leaks.I gave four to this movie because the scenery was really good. The rest is crap and made to exploit our deepest dissappoinments in life. That's all."
" Failed my hopes every couple of seconds..
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,1,"I am super surprised this was adapted from a Nicholas Sparks work. I had a few friends saying this was absolutely amazing and they couldn't get enough and it brought them to tears over and again, so I gave it a try. I tried to settle in after the first 15 minutes, but I still wasn't feeling this movie at all. I will say, the only thing I liked about this off the start was the scenery, which creates a ""romance in the air"" feeling that we all love from Nicholas Sparks. The characters really ticked me off, especially the main two.. isn't that awful? What got me the most was that this attraction seemed based off of nothing to me, that they didn't have anything in common, they're just attracted because they are polar opposites and a ""challenge"" to wrangle, kind-of-thing. Teresa Palmer's accent was very believable, sounded like she was from California, but no Australian detected. And was impressed with Alexandra Daddario's southern accent, especially as the movie developed. I have positive things to say about that. Again, was just really annoyed with the two leads, felt like they didn't belong together, saw no chemistry, found the Gabby character annoying instead of endearing, and just really felt this film was a waste of time. I did, however, love Travis' dog. So there's that."
" heart touching romance
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,10,"There are seldom such films that touches my heart and i wish to watch it a few more times. The best book adaptation film after Notebook from Nicholas Sparks. The romance it carries is such beautifully personified by both the characters. The country side scenario of Wilhemina, NC was such soothing views along with the movie plot. Such simple story yet portray a powerful romantic voice. Teresa Palmer was magnificent. Nothing too fancy on her role but a strong personality and the chemistry with Benjamin was enjoying to watch. The dialogues specifically were fantastic and especially the proposing scene. The story says a lot about unconditional and powerful love and that was perfectly crafted by the actors and director. I did not read the book but i think it was no less than it. Will watch it again with loved ones."
" Take note, book this great romance!
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,9,"I can't believe the negative critiques!! You have a good idea before the film starts that this is going to be a romantic story so if that's not for you then don't watch!!! I, however, wanted to see another story by the brilliant Nicholas Sparks and, even though I approached this film with a little hesitation and doubt because I didn't know the main actors, I was absolutely rewarded with a wonderful, poignant and heart-rending story which I loved. The setting is idyllic and the fabulous cinematography admirably captures this and the performances are superb I'm not going to detail any of the story but it kept me enthralled and I'd say it's on a par (at least) with the Note Book! Bright, fun, moving and charmingly captivating."
" Teresa Palmer is absolutely mesmerizing and amazing to watch in The Choice
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,10,"Absolutely enjoyed this film for Teresa Palmer, otherwise known as ""Gabby"" is so beautiful through her acting, personality, and appearance. With the addition to Benjamin Walker, otherwise known as ""Travis"" they compliment and build off of each other so very well that the movie is actually brought to life and shows so much more meaning then the film can grasp. Gabby is truly a wonderful lady and I'm sure she resembles a lot of the true personality traits of Teresa Palmer herself in real life for her acting was so breathtaking that it was like second nature to her. Truthfully I don't watch a lot of movies that deal with romance and never heard of Nicholas Sparks but from my mother and sister. I am a normal down to earth, happy go lucky guy who enjoys a good laugh.These aspects that most people rave about don't interest me, such as a movie actually isn't real life, but yet The Choice has found my Number #1 best movie slot in my mind, The Choice truly moved me and through Teresa Palmer's stunning work I see life truly is ""held together by choices, all shapes and sizes, right or wrong doesn't matter, because life just keeps unfolding, It won't wait around for you, If you sit still it can pass you by altogether, I guess I'd like to believe that all of these choices are made for us as soon as we enter this world, because if that's true, then we're exactly where we're supposed to be""(Gabby). This quote from The Choice is held true to me in my belief thanks to Gabby, for I would not had heard it if it wasn't for her, she always says what needs to be said and says it perfectly. Thank you Teresa Palmer for you are an astonishing actress and in all my dreams would I get to see you one day."
