" CRINGE
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,1,Aged actors trying to act 20 years younger!! Awkward and unfunny.
" Exactly what it's supposed to be and it's enjoyable!
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,7,"I don't understand the hate around this movie. This is basically an SNL movie... have you ever watched SNL? Does it scream ""high brow humor""? So I'm not sure what people expected here but it's exactly the type of comedy it promises to be and everyone in it is really good at it. Is it Oscar worthy? Definitely not but that's not the point. Just sit back, relax and have a few laughs!"
" Wasted (in more ways than one)
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,3,I do not normally watch this kind of thing but as I like Fey I gave it a shot. Really has American 'humour' sunk so low these days? It is supposed to be a comedy but do middle aged women really behave like ten year olds? Small wonder the USA is in the state it is in. Does every utterance the F word now?. Is the only humour that makes the USA audience laugh sex/toilet humour?
" A caustic comedy is sketchy and hit and miss, but fair entertainment
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,6,"Two single sisters (Amy Poehler and Tina Fey) in their 40s, one responsible, the other not, learn that their parents are selling the family home they grew up in. Upset, they decide to sneak in one last big party at the house and invite old friends. What could go wrong?There is plenty of caustic wit in the film and two very energetic leads from a pair of 'Saturday Night Leave' comedians who play well off of each other. Of course the film is very sketchy as would be expected with long periods of the film that works less well, but has enough to keep fans of chick flicks entertained."
" Awful
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,2,"Please dont waste your time on this horrible movie, I spent half of the run time cringing over how bad the comedy was."
" Enjoyable film
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,9,"I like this film have watched many times, never gets boring, good acting, funny scenes during their house party, good soundtrack.
Good acting, love Tins Fey, and Amy Poelher are a great team."
" Potential
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,5,Please stop telling Samantha Bee she can act and/or she's funny. She's sad and pathetic. A poor man's Kathy Griffin.
" I love Tina and everything she does
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,9,Even my husband who doesn't like chick flicks liked this film.
" Expected better...
",2020-01-21 00:00:00,3,"With the cast, and buzz of the film, I went into it blind and had high expectations. That being said. Boring plot, less than funny jokes. I didn't not laugh once. A boring, horrible performance. It was almost that they are begging you to laugh. Not impressed. It was bad all the way through. Only reason I rated it what I did, was the special features. They were funnier than the actual film. Dont waste your time."
" Sisters
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,9,"I don't get why pp say it's bad. I thought it was funny and had great pp in it. My husband and I laughed a lot it was entertaining
I love Amy P"
" Super clever and fun!
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,8,"Those who trashed this movie are just WRONG! It's not brilliant, but lots of fun and plenty of laughs. Worth your time! Tina and Amy are precious!"
" Silly fun
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,7,"I like this movie. It makes me and all my gal friends laugh. Why? Because it's pretty real to life. Parties get out of hand, people get drunk and contemplate the meaning of life, nervous flirting with guys, parents make decisions that make you feel lost. I honestly don't know how anyone can absolutely hate this movie. Judd Apatow does the same $hit but with an all male cast and it gets high ratings, but somehow this movie is considered trash? Hmmm...."
" Hilarious film!
",2019-08-05 00:00:00,10,Some people say this film isn't funny but they are wrong. Clearly they have no sense of humour and don't like laughing. Great film which I have watched more than once.
" Such an overall wonderful movie!!!
",2019-08-04 00:00:00,10,"Sisters is such a great movie with an incredible cast and storyline!!! It has laughter throughout the movie, love, lessons learned!!! I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE ABOVE THE AGE 18. A+++ Film"
" my notes
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,5,Meh. had lots of funny parts but also lots of unfunny parts and girly moments (1 viewing)
" Top three worst movies ever made...
",2019-06-21 00:00:00,1,"No use analyzing the plot of one the most idiotic movies ever made. The leads mugged their way through this garbage, but they're not talented enough to pull it off. No wonder Hollywood is dying..."
" Love this movie!!
",2019-04-21 00:00:00,10,"This is a hilarious movie, Amy & Tina are brilliant together!!"
" Party goes on too long
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,5,"Movie night with Iris.Always made sense to pair up Poehler and Fey. This takes a while to get into it's stride, is amusing enough in the middle; and then like all parties drags on too long."
" Sisters feels more like an over-extended SNL skit.
",2019-02-05 00:00:00,6,"Fey and Poehler are back. The dream duo of modern comedy that essentially reinvigorated 'Saturday Night Live', and with other female-centric comedies gaining great success ('Bridesmaids' in particular), this certainly needed to make an impression. Fortunately, it is one of about seven modern comedies that actually makes me chuckle on multiple occasions. Unfortunately however, it's just a two hour house party with minimal sisterly substance. Two sisters find out that their parents are selling their childhood home. Enraged by this revelation, they choose to throw one last wild house party with no regrets. The themes of nostalgia and growing up are buried beneath a script that is comprised of outlandish scenarios from an uncontrollable house party, and that is the film's biggest flaw. Substituting warmth and endearment for its characters with crude behaviour. Yet, despite the formulaic repercussions these sisters find themselves in, it is just so damn fun to watch. Fey and Poehler have such electric chemistry that the improvisation and jokes naturally bounce off of each other. Their energetic performances are infectious and will certainly put a smile on anyone's face. Sure the plot is just a bunch of random skits with SNL cast members, but the well executed editing makes for a cohesive (if forgettable) story. Whether it be Rudolph as a 'Game of Thrones' fan who flaunts her success or Cena as a tank of a drug dealer, there are plenty of memorable characters and scenes. For example, the pronunciation of Hae Won never fails to crack me up. A simple harmless joke that snorts a line of cocaine and cranks it up to maximum volume. ""Hey, One!"" ""No, it's Hae...Won"". Sweet ballerina music boxes, I live for those jokes! As always some of the one liners land, others miss completely. And at nearly two hours long, the house party does outstay its welcome and reminds you that the theme of growing up has been diminished. However, the superb lead performances and humour prevents this from just being a bunch of formulaic shenanigans involving alcohol, drugs and sex."
" slight but often quite funny
",2019-01-06 00:00:00,7,"In Sisters, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler play siblings who come to their childhood home and decide to relive the glory days of high school with a big party. It predictably rages out of control.This movies parodic takes on teen movies and aging are sometimes very amusing, although the movie sometimes veers uncomfortably from reality-based relationship comedy to over-the-top absurdities (i.e. the ballerina statue scene).The result sometimes lags, but the best moments, like a wonderful scene in which Poehler desperately tries to pronounce a pedicurist's name, are hilarious. (The pedicurist, Greta Lee, winds up at the party, although the writers seem unclear on what to do with her and for some reason she suddenly has hearing aids right at the end, which is huh?)Early on my girlfriend reached the ""I'll give it 10 more minutes"" point, but she wound up liking it. I kind of liked it all. It's not something for the ages, but it's cute, and that line about the different reasons to party when you're young and old is super clever."
" inane, vulgar rubbish
",2018-08-07 00:00:00,1,"By a distance the crudest and most pointless film I've seen to have come out of modern Hollywood(I've avoided others that I reckon must be equally bad).I bet this went down well with people under 30 but from my over 60 point of view it I blushed for all the people caught in a cinema watching this thinking they were seeing something funny and warm.The weird sisters were trapped in a perpetual teenage world view and their parents deserved better.Is there anyone so chained to the childhood home that they would act this way?Every scene was written by someone with a tin ear for humour.If in doubt make it sexual or toilet .The phallus on the wall is somehow a suitable symbol for this crass film.The two actresses involved ,somehow highly rated,should go and wash their mouths out with soap and water,then use their talents for better ends.I've heard a lot about how great they are but in scene after scene their reputations were diminished.God awful."
" ""Sisters"": A Fun House Party You Won't Remember the Next Day
",2018-06-07 00:00:00,6,"3 out of 5 stars (average)""Sisters"" is a film not made to be analyzed, but enjoyed. If you enjoy raunchy humor, you'll like this, but if you don't, then hit the deck.The film isn't saying or doing anything unique with its premise. It won't make you think about your life in any conceivable way, nor will it be something you watch for years and years to come. ""Sisters"" is enjoyable while it lasts, and in this case, that's just fine.As the title suggests, it follows two sisters, straight-laced Maura (Amy Poehler) and foul-mouthed Kate (Tina Fey having an absolute ball). Maura is reeling from a divorce 2 years ago, but is still successful. Kate has just been evicted, and has a daughter who is tired of being the mature one in their relationship. The sisters couldn't be more different, but love each other regardless.A problem arises when the parents (an underused Dianne Wiest and terrible James Brolin) inform Maura that they are selling the family home. Kate doesn't take this well, but suggests that the two have a party so that Maura can loosen up a bit, and bed the hot guy down the street (Ike Barinholtz). What follows is a night full of sex, drugs, and growing up for both sisters as they have their final night of fun in the house.This film is not amazing. I don't understand why other critics have been so harsh on it. They are correct in saying that both Poehler and Fey are funnier than this material and that it isn't very original, but they seem to forget that it could have been a lot worse. When I saw the trailer for this film, I thought to myself: this is either going to be funny or really, really bad. I admit that the film does have issues, but they are mostly overcome by watching Amy Poehler and Tina Fey have a good time, which, let's face it, is why most people will come to see this. People don't go to comedies for depth and understanding of the world, they go to laugh. If you like either of these actresses, then this film will make you laugh.Acting-wise, Amy Poehler is playing that same old Leslie Knope good girl that she always does, and doing a good job at it. It's so satisfying to see her let loose and have some fun, as her bubbly personality shines through. She also has good chemistry with Ike Barinholtz, who does a nice job of fulfilling the oh-so-difficult comedic love interest role. He isn't amazing, but he is good.Tina Fey is in fine form here, and surprised me the most. Normally playing the straight man (or woman in this case), Fey is living it up as the crazy, profane woman who says whatever comes to mind and doesn't care who it offends. I was unsure as to whether or not Fey could pull that off, but she does quite easily, making for a mostly enjoyable performance. WWE star John Cena's portrayal of a drug dealer is also hilarious, as Cena is able to get laughs just by standing in the middle of the floor, delivering stone-faced comments while the partying is going on around him. Cena has never been a very good actor, but the character plays to his strengths, making him a highlight. The only weak spots are the parents. Dianne Wiest is an extremely classy actress, so I cannot begin to fathom what brought her to this. She fares somewhat better than husband James Brolin, but I never want to hear her say the ""F"" word again. Brolin is terrible in this. He sleepwalks through the little he has to do, mucking up the one funny line they give him at the end. Yes it's a small complaint, but it is noticeable among the other performances.The film utilizes raunchy wit as its main source of humor. If this is not your cup of tea, then you will either last five minutes before walking out or have a 2 hour endurance test. I like raunchy humor when it's done correctly, meaning that the jokes are funny rather than just using the ""F"" word for the sake of it. If you want an example of what I'm referring to, then watch the horrid ""The Change-Up"". Or don't, it's terrible. Anyway, this film was clearly written for Fey and Poehler, as the two work off each other like a well-oiled machine. They are even good in the obligatory dramatic moment near the film's end, something that great comediennes can accomplish. Their banter is the primary reason to see this movie.The film also has a fine partying atmosphere, something that could make or break the film. Once the party gets going, we are bombarded with flashing lights, dance music, and shots of people doing crazy things. It all works to put you into the party zone without making you want to locate your Designated Driver and go home early. I have not seen a large number of ""house party"" comedies, but I might check some more out in the future.Again, this film is enjoyable because of the fun seeing real life BFF's Tina Fey and Amy Poehler on screen together. Their last outing, Baby Mama, did not have enough back-and-forth between the two, undermining its dynamite premise. This film does separate them from time to time, but it's for good reason, and they are funny even when apart. All in all, these Sisters are crazy, fun, and enjoyable, and sometimes, that's all you need for a good time at the movies.Rated R for Crude Sexual Content and Language Throughout, and Some Drug Material"
" Silly, Funny
",2018-05-20 00:00:00,6,I laughed a lot and would recommend for a blah evening when you just want to veg out and have a few laughs
" Started off at a 5 and slid to a 1
",2018-05-20 00:00:00,3,So very disappointed that these two would even put their names on this movie.
" Annoying as hell
",2018-05-09 00:00:00,3,"I dont like the fact that they chose these actors to do such movie, it would've been much better if they chose teenage actor who can actually pull it off, not a 30 year old acting all younf and stupid and rude. It really annoys me how Tina fey is acting like a 5 year old."
" Throwing everything against the wall to see what sticks inevitably means there will be a bunch of junk laying on the floor.
",2018-05-07 00:00:00,5,"Sisters tries really hard. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler certainly have chemistry and some of the best moments of the movie come from that chemistry. Still, the film falls flat on its face more than once.The movie is mostly cringe humor. It's filled with one character or another doing something embarrassing. While this can be done really well if used correctly, Sisters seems to hit everything with the cringe hammer until it cries.This isn't really expected, and neither is the abundant use of bodily and sexual humor. There are some great moments in the movie relating to these, as well.The real issue with the movie is it feels like the writers went at it with a list of ""funny"" situations and tried to fit them all into a loose theme."
" IS IT PAST THE TUTU?
",2018-04-29 00:00:00,7,"Maura Ellis (Amy Poehler) is the younger and more stable of the two sisters. She is overly helpful to a fault. No seriously, It is a fault. Kate (Tina Fey) the younger sister can't hold a job and is a bad influence for her daughter (Madison Davenport) who is more adult than her. When their parents sell their home the film turns into a high school reunion film with the sisters taking on opposite roles for the night...that is a high school reunion plus hot Asian chicks which are in vogue right now.I admit I had many laugh out loud moments in a comedy that also had a lot of misses. The crude humor made me think this was a teen sex comedy for middle aged women. Not as good as ""Bridesmaids"" but if you liked that film, you should smile at this one.Guide: Plenty of swearing. No nudity. Samantha Bee in a sex scene, sort of."
" Gets you tired
",2018-04-24 00:00:00,3,First time I don't like a movie where Tina fey is in. It is just not good.
" Genuine laugh out loud
",2018-04-22 00:00:00,9,"Too long, yes, but had me grinning start to finish and some serious laugh out loud moments. Great performances all round. Loved it."
" Watch if you want to be lobotomized
",2018-03-20 00:00:00,1,"I don't have a sister, but after watching this, I'm glad I don't. According to the writers, all they do is constantly shout and embarrass one another. You know it's bad when John Cena is actually one of the best characters in a movie, but that is sadly the case. His character's very brief scenes were the only times I laughed in this whole thing, except for when the Mark Wahlberg look-alike fell on a ballerina music box and got it literally stuck up his rectum. I don't know if I was laughing out of frustration with the sheer absurdity of it all, like having a kind of mental breakdown from trying to tolerate this crapfest for so long, or if it's just because I hate mark Wahlberg. Maybe it was a bit of both. Either way, it was tragically the high point of this otherwise steaming pile of you know what."
" Pleasantly surprised !
",2018-03-17 00:00:00,8,"I was putting this movie off because I really like the actresses, but was afraid that movie wouldn't be good. I actually really liked it, had some laughs, and just really liked their dynamic."
" Enjoyable enough for what it is
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,7,"It's not uncommon to see Saturday Night Live alumni on the big screen together. Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi, Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy, Adam Sandler and Rob Schneider, the list goes on. Now step forward Amy Poehler and Tina Fey who co-headline this enjoyable comedic romp to show that anything the boys can do, the ladies can do just as well.Kate (Fey) and Maura (Poehler) are sisters who have led very different lives since leaving the family home. Kate is a hairdresser whose free-spirited life has seen her own daughter become disillusioned with her, while Maura is a kind-spirited, recently divorced nurse who always puts others before herself. When their parents announce they are selling the family home, the two sisters seize the opportunity to have one last big party in the house before the uptight new owners move in.If you were lucky enough to catch Poehler and Fey back in the days when they were co-anchoring SNL's Weekend Update segment, you'll already know that they have great chemistry together. This is also not their first feature together, having previously co-starred in 2004's MEAN GIRLS and 2008's BABY MAMA, not forgetting hosting the Golden Globes. The two actresses are clearly having a ball here, cast as close but ultimately differently natured sisters, both responding to the trials and tribulations the world has given them in their own way. Fey is particularly fun here, really relishing the opportunity to play a character who is as vulgar with her language as she is carefree with her life choices.Inevitably with this sort of family-themed anarchic comedy, there are some life lessons to be had here. The choices we make in life and the bond between siblings are all explored in Paula Pell's script, which does at times cross over into cliché territory. SISTERS allows itself to slow down a bit too much in these moments to the point where the film looses some of its pacing. It's not enough to hamper the fun though, which is mostly consistent even if a few running gags don't quite hit as hard as they hoped (a mispronunciation of a Korean nail salon worker's name is played just that bit too long).While this is undoubtedly Poehler and Fey's film, the large supporting cast all get their moments too. As their parents James Brolin and Dianne Wiest register some decent laughs, as do fellow SNL alumni Maya Rudolph and WWE wrestler John Cena, who crops up for a cameo as a heavily tattooed drug dealer named Pazuzu (he also gets one of the film's most laugh-out-loud bits of dialogue).SISTERS' humour is heavy on the crude scale; there's things going up bums, jokes about masturbation and stories of peculiar sexual encounters. Much like TRAINWRECK earlier this year, SISTERS is not afraid to run with the female driven gross-out comedy element, and it's all the better for it. In fact, if it wasn't for some of the sagging issues when the inevitable third act life lessons begin, SISTERS could well have been a contender for comedy of the year. As it is, this is still a very enjoyable time in the company of two of Hollywood's funniest comediennes."
" Wait a minute...WHAT?
",2018-03-07 00:00:00,4,"Wait wait wait...what was that ending?At the end of the party, the entire swimming pool sinks into a giant sinkhole. Then, in what can only be a few days later (if that), Amy's character is swimming in the backyard pool as though nothing happened? So they fixed the sinkhole AND replaced the swimming pool AND had it ready for swimming, all before Tina's character had a chance to wipe ""I Love Balls"" off the fridge??!?"
" just a cash grab
",2018-01-24 00:00:00,3,I guess that proves that women can be just as sick as men. Hollywood is dead and now what passes entertainment is take a women and writer her as a man...
" Mindless? Check. Fun? Not so much.
",2018-01-16 00:00:00,3,"Sisters has pretty much everything going for it except that one thing that you really need to make a good comedy - being funny. It's not that I expected much from the movie - mindless fun was all I was after. I did get the mindless, just not the fun. Amy Poehler and Tina Fey are about as funny as they come, and it's obvious that they have a great chemistry. Supporting cast are stellar comedic talents too. Except, I couldn't get one decent laugh during the movie. Gigs were off, writing was pretty bad, plot was meandering and the 'characters' were just vehicles for the stars to do what they thought would be funny. It's kind of sad, really - this team can do much better!"
" Childhood Home Attachment
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"(Flash Review)At what lengths would you, as an adult, stoop to keep your childhood home more than just a memory? Poehler and Fey play adults with parents looking to move and downsize out of their family house. Poehler and Fey are not having any of it when asked to clean out their childhood bedrooms that haven't been touched since they moved out. Now back in town and remembering old friends, many of which now have children, they decide to throw an old school house party as a break from reality. How wild will it get? How much damage will be done? Will the parents still be able to sell or will they still decide to? Overall, this had better humor than most modern comedies these days of the same flavor. With ample crass and lewd moments, there are some actual smart gags and their overall tone is more light-hearted than dark. Unsurprisingly, the core story started to weaken toward the end as they had to deal with the actual plot. If you like the duo of Poehler and Fey, you'll enjoy this."
" Underrated Romp but Good
",2017-10-10 00:00:00,8,"Yes, there are those who don't like this movie. I can understand that. Like with so many others, this is one movie that I like that not everyone else may like. I actually saw this with my mom and aunt (who are, of course, sisters) and they thought it was good too. My mom and I thought it was pretty funny; as usual, my brother was not one who was easy to win over. Ever since I was practically forced to watch ""Mean Girls"" back in 2004, I have found myself drawn to Tina Fey and Amy Poehler time and time again. I enjoyed them but loathed that movie. Anyway, with this underrated gem, Amy is the reserved Maura who finds herself more in love with her work than anything. As for Tina, she's the party woman who has a hard time trying to get through to her daughter. Then there come the parents (James Brolin and Dianne Wiest), who tell them the news that they're selling the childhood home that the ladies grew up in.So the ladies plan a last-ditch effort to have one final party before the house is sold. They invite all of their old high school friends and purposely leave off one: a character played by Maya Rudolph. As the party begins, Maya tries everything in her power to get access to the party and fails. Once she does get into the party, it goes from bad to worse.When that happens, the parents are the voice of reason and manage to get the ladies to grow up and bond as sisters. When all is said and done, the bond that they have is tighter than before and they actually enjoy one another's company. Granted it may not be a riot as some people say, it is still funny nonetheless. Watch it at least once. If necessary, twice. You may find something that you may enjoy."
" Am I the only one that DIDN'T like this film?
",2017-05-22 00:00:00,3,"I went to see this movie right after we saw Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip (admittedly, we snuck into this one). This movie wasn't a good experience, but it wasn't as bad as an experience as Why Him was.Tina Fey and Amy Poehler seem to have some talent with them. I never really seen anything that they're in, but they had okay performances here. But for a comedy, it wasn't very funny. I don't recall laughing. At all. But yet, the whole theater was. I'm sorry, but I just don't find Tina Fey cussing up a storm funny. I guess that scene where she rolls around on the floor like a child was kinda funny, but I remember it being kind of forced.There's nothing much to say about this one. I didn't really like this one. The only thing I did like about it was John Cena."
" Sisters Review
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,8,"Who's funnier than Tina and Amy together? Not really anyone, that's who. These two being in Sisters together proves it.Synopsis: Sisters Kate and Maura Ellis are summoned home to clean out their childhood bedroom before their parents sell the family house, much to their dismay. Looking to recapture their glory days, they throw one final high-school-style party for their classmates, which turns into the cathartic rager that a bunch a ground-down adults really need. Starring: Tina Fey, Amy Poehler Director: Jason MooreSo, I have heard a lot of people compare this movie to Step- Brothers. First of all, people need to stop doing that. They judge movies in the wrong light if they compare. Secondly, Step-Brothers was a horrible movie (yet something else people need to stop saying in that Step-Brothers is a funny movie). As it is, Step-Brothers doesn't compare to this movie.There was little to nothing wrong with this movie. The only thing that I had a problem with was the fact that a mom didn't have tabs on her own daughter. I am a parent myself, and I wouldn't let my kids go away for a few months without knowing exactly what is going on. That's just me though.Just have to put this one out there. Cena was hilarious for the little time he was in the movie. And it wasn't even Cena. Most of the supporting cast, including James Brolin and Diane Wiest, had some of the funniest parts in the movie.Some people look at movies and wonder why they had been made. I have done that on more than one occasion. With this movie, I did not do that. I wonder why this movie was made sooner. The funniest part about it is that there is supposed to be comedy throughout the movie. The movie did have a bit of comedy, but it was the story that drove the movie.Final Thoughts: Watch this movie. That's the best thing I can say, just watch the movie. You'll thank me for it later.Rating: 8 out of 10"
" Middle Aged White People Can Party Too
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,5,"This movie is really about the party and not much else. It's as if they said, ""Hey, wouldn't it be a great idea to have a movie featuring a party with a bunch of middle aged, middle class white people?"" And then they wrote a lame plot around the idea of a party.The party has every aspect of a great movie-party as if they had a checklist. Music, dancing, copious amounts of alcohol, illegal drugs, driving under the influence, a girl-on-girl fight, a noise complaint and a visit from the police, destruction of property, etc. The only thing they didn't have was nudity.My suggestion is that you go live your own life. Go out with your own friends and have fun yourself and don't waste your time watching this lame movie."
