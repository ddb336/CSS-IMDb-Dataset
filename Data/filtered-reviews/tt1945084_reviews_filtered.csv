" Yikes!
",2021-03-10 00:00:00,5,"When I got this from the library I thought it was a film I'd seen before, with a woman trapped in an apartment in a suspenseful situation. What I found was the same basic concept, enhanced (?), or perhaps propelled, by a blood bath which Quentin Tarantino might have created if he were in a really bad mood. Tarantino would've given us a few laughs to break the tension, however.I give this 5 stars instead of the 2 I think it deserves solely due to the performance of Salma Hayek. She put a lot into the performance of a story which did not give her much room for expression. I don't think that Everly is quite as two-dimensional as some reviewers stated, but it's not a great role. Ms. Hayek did what could be done with it."
" This is a really bad and depressing movie
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,1,"Lots of guns and shooting, but no story. Depressing. Don't watch."
" My New Favorite Holiday Movie
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,8,"Everly (Salma Hayek) is an overworked woman who has had it with her boss and her job. Unfortunately, her employer doesn't have much of a retirement plan so when he wants her terminated, he really means it. Having not seen her family in four years and wanting a better work/life balance, she takes her frustrations out on her co-workers who are also angry at not getting a Christmas bonus. Her family also gets treated poorly when they visit her at work.
The special effects crew worked overtime on what starts out as an action/thriller but soon morphs into a very, very dark comedy that'll make you appreciate having the opportunity to work from home.
The beautiful Hayek shows off her acting chops whether it's taking a stand against workplace sexual harassment or using a machine gun against the HR department. Die Hard and It's A Wonderful Life both take a back seat to this Christmas gem. You'll have to watch it to see if everyone lives happily ever(ly) after."
" Really Enjoyable Action with Horror elements
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,7,"Fantastically over the the top, good fun action. I don't understand why it doesn't have a higher rating. Hubby and I both thoroughly enjoyed it."
" Rather dull Christmas action
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,4,"For all it's action full of guts and blood the movie left me bored. Throughout its runtime I kept checking the time in hope that the end is near. By the last half hour I was completely checked out. The acting is downright awful, most of the actors are just terrible, especially Salma Hayek. The best performance can be attributed to the crazy Japanese torturer who in some ways was genuinely creepy. Furthermore the jokes were not funny and felt juvenile, as if they were written by a 12 year old. On top of that, it's one of those movies that tries to portray Europe as America. Luckily, in this case it's confined to one apartment building but in my opinion it still looked rather European. I usually like movies that take place in one building or room but for some reason this particular setting was very dull. The aspect that I liked the most about this film is that it takes place around Christmas. The songs combined with the decorations create a genuine Christmas atmosphere which I always appreciate. And because I love finding new weird Christmas movies this gets a 4 instead of a potentially lower rating."
" Too vicious!
",2020-12-03 00:00:00,3,"Hey, I like action. And I like Selma Hayek.
What I don't like is torture porn. And this was just too close to that.
Throw in the cheap emotion (it's just too easy to manipulate the audience once kids are involved) and what had the potential to be something like Kill Bill became rather too I Spit On Your Grave for my tastes."
" Decent little comedy
",2020-11-23 00:00:00,5,Wasn't bad. Its kinda funny. Wouldve been better if they made Selma more bad ass but Hollywood can't write for crap anymore.
" Messy action flick.
",2020-11-09 00:00:00,5,"Have some great use of practical effects, but the acting and history makes you cringe with dislocated humor everywhere and every time.I have seen better low-budget movies with less bad timing for humor and better plots."
" Just Go For It
",2020-10-12 00:00:00,8,"(deep breath) A florid ballad of subtle, deeply-entwined themes expressed in an artistic symphony of cinematic choreography or a good shoot-'em-up?
Pick one. Three chances, last two don't count.
Although I'd pay to watch Salma Hayak wash dishes, I avoided this title simply because I was weary of the same old formulas. ""Working"" at home has me literally devouring content but like an assembly line. Movie starts, shrugs begin and it becomes just another background noise to the dozen other distractions. Might sit down and actually watch for a few minutes at a time but ultimately it passes, as forgettable as a political ad. NEXT!
Well, let's try this one... Whoa! Big surprise. I bet there are DOZENS of movies I don't like but just let rattle on in background; many more I simply end in the first minutes. I only review movies I believe are due special mention for good OR bad and this one definitely was marked for review. As in it's the next day and the first thing I'm doing so I won't forget.
Here's why this is an eight for me: 1. ZERO dinking around. Hit that switch! I embrace deep, complex storytelling such as... say, The Shawshank Redemption but usually we all just zoom in wanting a quick double cheeseburger vs a 5-course formal dinner. Sometimes you just want to get to the meat 'n cheese. In the mood for some ""I Spit On Your Grave"" justice but with ALL these type movies I do not like the (essential but excruciating SKIP for me) long build-up of abuse. As ex EMT I've seen plenty and can ""take it"" but don't like wallowing in watching the good guys rack up their share of torture, etc. to get to the Righteous Revenge level. Without spoilers, You Get The Gist without the usual painful witness of a first half full of nothing but cringe.
2. Is this a ""serious"" movie, camp or mix of both? Yes... er, no. None of those but... um... maybe... ah... You be the judge. Heck, I'm still not sure WHAT that was but witness the objective evidence of soon sitting down and watching. By the reviews I'm thinking this element tripped up some expectations either way or mix of both. So I bet some ""Oh, no way"", ""Why did he/she do that?"", ""That's unlikely"" elements might seem ""pushing it"" for a so-called serious movie vs dozens of the same things we don't even blink at in other movies such as superhero flicks or even Adam Sandler comedies. There didn't seem to be any solid answer on this one. Don't go in with too many expectations and let it speak for itself. Kudos for the sharp bits of humor that had me laughing out loud. Deftly done... a rare skill these days.3. I guess 1 & 2 say it all if not TMI. This whole thing has only inspired me to get back to the basement lab and the variable time vector experiments ... there's a lot of alternate universes to search before finding the one where Salma is my wife. (No, really! See? She's making eye contact through the screen, right at me and me alone!) Sigh. (Secret Lab Log. AU #3,657,894: Progress of sorts. Actually part of Salma's HOUSEHOLD in this universe. The search goes on, tho assistants have quit and can't pay rent. Ha! Well, they called Howard Hughes crazy, too and ... waitaminute ...)"
" Torn
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,5,"First off, I'd like to thank the executive producers that funded this film for offering one of the most beautiful women in the world enough money to get her to agree to play a character in a film that wears nothing but tight-fitting clothing, very little of it at times, and all the while contorting her rocking bod in a variety of different ways from start to finish. For Salma, judging from the quality of many of your past roles and productions, I imagine that you were paid well and likely in an amount that few who are reading it would freely turn away from. Regarding the acting, dialogue and plot, mediocre at best and cringe-worthy (even LOL) at times. This is clearly a film where it is best that you leave your brain at the door, provided that you have anything to work with in the first place. The camera work, lighting and sound is solid Hollywood crew fair, so hat's off to all of the behind the scenes crew that likely worked their tails off. I'm giving this a 5 because of Hayek's beauty, the crew's solid work and because I was rarely bored even if I was laughing at something that the filmmakers didn't intend for me to laugh at."
" Sick movie
",2020-09-27 00:00:00,3,Only good thing in this movie was Salma who is so gorgeous and sexy.
" Salma
",2020-09-18 00:00:00,4,"I went into this with pretty low expectations and I can gladly say, it surpassed them! Not by a lot, but still. I'd never heard of this and thought it'd be nice to see the lovely Hayek in another flick but WOW is this generic while also trying to be really serious and really not all at once! It doesn't work particularly well on any level but it is mildly entertaining and it's still fun to see Hayek kicking some butt. I wouldn't ever go out of my way for this, but if you're looking for pure background noise, this is pretty good for that."
" Good acting
",2020-09-17 00:00:00,8,"Salma Hayek made this movie... her acting skills show in every scene. I would never expect her in an action movie but she pulled it off! Not only is she one of the prettiest women in Hollywood but she's a very good actress as well. Watch till the end, you will enjoy it. Don't forget the popcorn!"
" One apartment and gun swinging ninjas and hookers
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,8,I was surprised by this movie.. it was a lot of fun if your looking for shootem up style ... kind of reminds me of A Tarantino film. This one is worth the watch
" The worst thing since Xanadu
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,1,"No Spoilers - there aren't any.It only had to be mildly entertaining... it isn't. Lots of poorly choreographed gun fights. but some money was put into it, just no style brains or heart. Salma, we'll try to forget this one, please don't do it again."
" An ultra-violent revenge romp that is never boring
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,5,"In this 2014 action thriller directed by Joe Lynch and written by Yale Hannon based on a story by Lynch and Hannon, Salma Hayek (replacing Kate Hudson) plays a former yakuza sex-slave who is forced to fight back against a legion of killers who are out to collect the bounty on the heads of her and her family. It's a pretty ultra-violent revenge romp that is never boring thanks to some fast paced action that are creative enough to keep things from becoming stale too quickly, and Hayek is good in a role that lets her channel her inner GI Jane, even if Lynch allows her to be objectified by the camera despite the fact she's playing a character who's impetus for everything is a gang rape. The movie premiered at Fantastic Fest in 2014, before being released on iTunes and receiving a limited theatrical release by Dimension Films. Critics hated it, but there's enough bloody violence and gore (it is filled to the brim with severed heads, disembowelment via acid, and blood-spurting arteries) that those who like their action filled with blood and guts will get a kick out it."
" Everly
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,2,"Joe Lynch's action/dark comedy movie ""Everly"" is a fast moving slog, if that makes any sense. Everly stars Salma Hayek as the titular character and follows her as she defends herself against the Japanese mob (presumably Triads. This is never elaborated on.) and tries to keep her mother and daughter out of harm's way.The reason I call it a fast paced slog is because the action is brisk and competently filmed; albeit relatively unremarkable in its choreography. It's the scenes in between the action that bring the movie down. While Salma Hayek commits to the role and gives a solid performance, the movie's writing is lackluster. The main antagonist is barely present and doesn't make much of an impact, especially when compared to one like Hans Gruber of Die Hard, a movie that clearly inspired Everly.All the characters aside from Everly are nothing to remember. Neither Edith or Maisey are developed in any way, which makes sense because Everly has been estranged from them for 4 years, but the movie insists on bringing them to the forefront of the story. They make for a good motivation for Hayek's character but fail on being compelling by themselves. As for other characters, there's ""The Sadist"" who comes out of nowhere with no pretense or mention after his death, and seems entirely out of place in the relatively down-to-Earth story; resembling a comic book villain. There's also ""Dead Man"" who is interesting but is only used to add a layer of unnecessary ""philosophy"" to the dialogue. His lines consist of pointing out things to Everly that she could've figured out herself which would've strengthened an already decently strong character, and lines like ""A sanctuary sometimes resides in the eye of the storm.""Dialogue and tone is often over the top with lines such as the previously mentioned, sometimes eliciting chuckles and other times groans. There's a copious amount of whores that file in one after the other, often getting killed or killing each other, alongside pretty much all of ""The Sadist's"" dialogue that feels like it was borrowed from a poor man's Kill Bill. Other times there are recognizable Christmas (hey look, another Die Hard parallel) songs that play during action sequences, which then promptly cut off and veer into torture of characters. Hammy and bleak dialogue follows firefights which are in turn followed immediately by wannabe family drama. It's all over the place.Moments such as Everly trying to get her mother and her daughter to get some money that was hidden in the apartment where the movie takes place are set up to be limited-time scenarios deflate due to terrible pacing; Everly trying to get them to take the money and leave as fast as possible, which turns into a scene where her mother ignores this and scolds Everly. It's frustrating to see a time constraint set up and then done away with in less than 5 minutes. The writing is odd to say the least.The things that stick out in a positive way are Hayek herself, (and her mesmerizing cleavage) and the gore/practical effects. Hayek fully embraces the role and its requirements, mediocre comedy, gun-toting badassery, undercooked backstory, and all. It's nice to see squibs and charges go off in an action movie; an increasingly rare occurrence these days. However, even this comes with a backhanded compliment: sometimes the gore/torture feels distasteful, like it goes on too long and revels in close-ups of things like battery acid being dripped onto Everly and a man being prodded (literally) to insult himself.In total, Everly provides some decent action with solid practical effects, a good central turn from Salma Hayek, and not much else. Everly is a brainless and mostly sadistic film that stumbles over itself time and time again. If you're in the mood to watch a bad action movie, Everly has got you covered.29/100"
" Crazy Film!
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,5,Silly but fun action flick. Salma Hayek was sexy and badass! 5/10
" So much potential
",2019-08-08 00:00:00,4,But overall this film just goes too over the top too many times. In an extreme and grotesque way. Wish they'd dialed that WAY back and just made it an awesome action film with Salma. Kinda regret ever watching this.
" Everly move you make, we'll be shooting you!
",2019-06-12 00:00:00,5,"Since the start of the century or so, there seemingly exists an additional new sub-genre within the world of action/thriller cinema, which is best described as ""Shoot 'em Up"" films. ""Shoot 'em Up"", starring Clive Owen, itself is obviously a good example, but there's also ""Crank"", ""Hardcore Henry"", ""Free Fire"", ""Taken"" and this ""Everly"". You guessed it; - these are films with very thin plots and without any proper character development, but they primarily focus on non-stop violent action, excessively over-the-top gunfire action and a practically immeasurable body count. They are entertaining if you're in a completely undemanding mood, I reckon, but they are quite unmemorable as well. Moreover, despite all the action and bloodshed, these films are actually sort of boring, because they constantly repeat the same old ""bang-bang-you-are-dead"" routine.The sole difference between ""Everly"" and the aforementioned titles is that the indestructible killing machine here is a woman; - and one of the sexiest specimens on the planet, I may add. In fact, one might even shallowly state that any film starring Salma Hayek in a tight and bloodied tank top is worth checking out, regardless of the quality. Hayek, pushing 50 but still looking as fit as a 28-year-old, depicts the private luxury prostitute of an Asian crime lord, locked up in a fancy apartment. One day, however, Everly decides she doesn't want to be Taiko's prisoner anymore. The film opens with a heavily injured Everly and a room full of dead Asian gangsters already. I feared the script would be another structural mess with flashbacks but, to my surprise, the plot simply continues from there onwards and Everly only takes on new and other opponents. She tries to reach her mother and estranged 4-year-old daughter, and she receives help from a slowly dying but remorseful Asian she refers to as ""Dead Man"". Apart from a few notable highlights, including the battle of the prostitutes and the sickening games of the aptly named The Sadist, ""Everly"" is mundane and passable. The violence is really graphic, but never shocking or even remotely upsetting because writer/director Joe Lynch (""Wrong Turn 2"") couldn't decide if he wanted a serious or a light-headed film."

" nothing made sense in this movie
",2019-02-03 00:00:00,2,"Nothing really made sense. Why didn't they, and the big yakuza chief just kill her since they put out a $50k hit to get others to kill her? What was the point of sending in the weird pair of sadist-masochist? Who sent them and what was the purpose of sending them. What was the point of sending up the guy with the dog?
Why on earth would she invite her mother and child into the bloodbath? - yes nominally to get the money but she could have just thrown it out the window to them.
Was there no fire escape to try to exit?There is no plot, just Salma Hayek shoots a bunch of people and gets slightly wounded. She is also not a very good shot; she can't seem to really kill people by shooting them while they are standing in front of her. At the end of the movie the floor is littered with bullets - not the casing the full bullets."
" Bound Meets Kill Bill
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,7,"Perfect Saturday afternoon diversion with lots of fast-paced action. There's barely a moment to breath as trouble comes around the corner or up the elevator or across the street with little time to reflect. Some expected mom/daughter exposition, half in Spanish. Don't look for complications. Think more like playing Hitman on easy, as the bad guys just keep coming and falling. Everly takes her lumps (big ones) though, her health bar goes to zero, then we get a parting surprise. Enjoyed every minute, even the predicable moments."
" An Uneven Action Thriller
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,8,"23 April 2015. Selma Hayek finds herself literally thrown into a Kill Bill No. 1 (2003) and Pulp Fiction (1994) fantasy movie which oddly enough almost succeeds. This dark comedy unfortunately turns quite black, almost gangrene in nature by the end of the movie. However, what is rather special and unique about this movie is its predominance of humor within the serious nature of assassination attempts and up to the last third of the movie, Everly manages to be one of the blackest laid over a humorous foundation that rivals almost any dark comedy. Additionally Selma Hayek's character intriguingly enough pulls off escape after escape in the confines of a single apartment that never really, truly offends the logical senses. Almost every action taken by Hayek's character almost seems plausible, and the script never crosses the line into pure imaginary fantasy unlike so many special effects filled action thrillers. What really pulls this movie down is its sudden change of tone towards death and drama that overtakes the nature of the movie. Until the very end, which is done quite well, this movie thrusts the audience into a roller coaster with the wheels coming off and destroying what might have been a fabulous, entertaining movie. What actually happens is this movie presents a good performance by Selma Hayek, a plot that seems to resist illogical craziness, and yet introduce a sadistic element that seems at odds with the rest of the movie. Nevertheless, if one overcome watching almost two movies in one, with one almost a X-rated violation of human nature, then this movie is worth watching for both its inhuman and human nature exposed large."
" Darker exploitation movie.
",2018-11-24 00:00:00,7,Everly is a bit fantastic in scenario and plot but it makes up for all the pot holes with some very sexy action. The lead actress is really tough and looks amazing to. The director knows how to play the audience to a certain degree and seems more authentic than the average Q.T effort. A harp back to the real exploitation movies of the 1970's.
" Light, violent entertainment
",2018-08-13 00:00:00,6,"Entertaining, gritty, funny, violent action packed & gory. Really good film!Don't take it too seriously or think too much into it. Just sit back and enjoy the ride, as it intends."
" Ridiculous, gory action fun
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,10,"It's a pretty good movie in the extreme action violence exploitation film genre, where it's bloody to the point where it's more ridiculous than actually realistic. Blood and gore galore. This is for fans of movies like Hobo With a Shotgun or Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky.It's a very simple but entertaining premise, where Salma Hayek is stuck in an apartment, while she fights off waves of bad guys coming in trying to kill her. The entertainment comes from the variety in the assassins being sent in to kill her, from gun-toting hookers, to katana-wielding Yakuza guys, to evil SWAT guys, to some bizarre sado-masochists. Ridiculous stuff.If I had to complain about anything, I'd say I would have liked to see maybe fewer shootout scenes and more martial arts instead, which would have been perfect for a movie like this. Swords and knives do come into play, but not enough for this to be considered a martial arts movie."
" Salma is a very poor actor.

" Don't you say her name
",2018-01-15 00:00:00,5,"Everly (Salma Hayek) is a prostitute for the mob who was disobedient and gang raped (off screen). She then goes into a berserker mode with a gun she had left in the commode tank top. More people show up to confront her, but she has an arsenal at her disposal and resolve to live to save her mother and daughter.The action, which consisted of a lot of shooting, blood, and killing takes place in an apartment building so the scenery doesn't change.This is a low budget ""Kill Bill"" type of thing. We don't get to know the background to the on going killings until later in the story, and even then it wasn't much of a tale.Guide: F-bomb. No sex. Hayek- back nudity only. Blood squirts"
" If you loved The Mexican trilogy, this is your movie
",2017-12-20 00:00:00,7,"Can't understand why there's so much bad rating about this movie. This movie is perfect! There are some minor flaws, as others action movies have, but this... It's just perfect. It's like Desperado, like there's more money for Robert Rodriguez to do a better a better movie. If you don't care about perfectness, just watch it to have some fun with some crazy action movie, go and watch it."
" A mob boss sends hit men after his ex girlfriend
",2017-11-18 00:00:00,4,"In my honest opinion I am being generous to give this movie a 4 rating. Salma Hayek worked hard to play this role but this isn't the kind of part that is best for her. Having said that, this movie is entertaining but the story isn't very believable. Akie Kotabe's part was absolutely miserable and he played it well but so could anyone for that matter. As far as character's go all these characters were shabby to say the least but I still enjoyed this flick. I advise anyone who wants to watch this movie to do so with an open mind and to do so without being too critical. You don't want to miss the last thirty minutes."
" Horrible, repulsive, no redeeming features
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,1,"What can you say about this repulsive, mindless film?If you liked Boondock Saints, you'll love this. Have we become so desensitized to violence that we now need films like this to titillate and shock us? On what planet would a decent person be *entertained* by this bloodbath? You've heard of food porn? Well, this must be death porn, or gore porn.The plot is...are you kidding me? There is no plot. Just cold, unfeeling, dehumanizing death, torture, and destruction.I felt numb after watching this film, like a little part of my soul died with every thud of a corpse."
" One hell of a ride
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,5,"This is the story of a kidnapped woman who faces down hit men sent by a mob boss/her captor while trying to protect her family from his wrath.This is pure over the top fun, at times very brutal. It's a film that feels like something that Luc Besson or Robert Rodriguez would of done. Its a crazy ride. Being set mostly in one room it keeps you engaged and captivated through the way it is shot. Selma Hayek returns to her early action film roots and shows she can still kick ass. There are some scenes that are brutal and some what disturbing. its a crazy wild fun ride that has less plot and more over the top action, true action fans will love this film."
" Comic Book ""Non-Credible"" type of film
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,4,Too far fetched to be taken anywhere near seriously. Always love seeing Salma but this film becomes predictable and boring way too soon. Kill Bill does it so much better and its a shame. Salma needs more parts that give her a chance to really act. Frida is an excellent example. Hope later opportunities are better for her than this.
" Not Sure why this is Scored so Low
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,8,"Maybe this isn't a perfect movie but it is pretty original. Set in one apartment, it mirrors the life of Everly, a woman who's been held there as a sex slave for four years. Certainly, the bad guys are fatally inept, but that is the seed of most action movies, today.A good action movie not only requires action, but also decent acting. Salma Hayak is definitely a competent actress. There's a nice mix of grief and fatalism in her personality. Yes, you are pretty aware that the bad guys, even when they have her dead in their sights, will make a mistake and she will capitalize on that mistake in the bloodiest way possible.The ""dead man"" who spends a good deal of the movie on Everly's couch, is a nice tragicomic addition to the movie. He's a man who knows he will be dead soon and tries to redeem himself in the most low-key way possible.All in all, a nice tight little action movie."
" Lots of Room To Die!!!
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,10,"""Wrong Turn 2"" helmer Joe Lynch co-wrote ""Everly"" with freshman scenarist Yale Hannon, and they have fashioned a gripping as well as ghoulish action yarn that confines Hispanic starlet Selma Hayek to an urban apartment complex where she shoots, slashes, and blows up dozens of armed and dangerous adversaries that are determined to kill her. Blood, gore, and more will challenge anybody with a tender soul who tries to take in this bloodbath of a movie. Villains die in every imaginable way and some that you'd prefer not to imagine. Our heroine survives a baptism by fire (literally), lead, and tempered steel in the form of Yakuza swords. As the eponymous character, Selma Hayek is a sex slave for an Asian crime lord, but she has had enough of his infamous ways and chooses to fight back. Ladies, if you've just experienced a nasty break-up, ""Everly"" may serve as way to get over her ex-partner. You made find closure in your own affair with the gruesome scene where our heroine dispatches the dastard that has put her through Hell and still threatens to kill her young daughter. Nothing about this brisk, brusque, 92-minute shoot'em up and slice'em down saga qualifies as ordinary, and ""Everly"" lives up to its R-rating with ""strong bloody violence, torture, nudity, sexual images and language."" For the record, however, Selma doesn't shed her apparel and parade around in her birthday suit. No, I haven't seen ""Wrong Turn 2"" yet, but I'd put Joe Lynch on his watch-list after having partaken of this gritty, grueling, cynical thriller that turns our heroine into the equivalent of Rambo on a rampage. Mind you, she doesn't come out of this melodrama without a scratch and her adversaries outnumber her from start to finish until a long-overdue SWAT team arrives with bodies littering the premise like confetti. You've never seen Selma as she is in ""Everly."" I'm not sure that a title like ""Everly"" fits this actioneer and if it isn't a cult film, it should be. Basically, our heroine has been held captive in this apartment complex where a crime boss keeps his gash stashed and she rebels with an automatic pistol that she has apparently hidden in the water tank of her toilet. Despite the claustrophobic quality of the setting, Lynch never lets the suspense abate, and some of the characters, such as the Sadist (whose comeuppance is appropriate) are quite memorable. Don't expect a lot in the way of poetic dialogue because these characters are locked into a life and death struggle throughout the mayhem. Lynch has orchestrated the events perfectly and he knows when to let things get a little goofy. More often than not, the bloodshed is over the top, and the body count stacks up to double digits. Selma looks good despite all the Hell that she goes through before fade-out. This one gets my strongest recommendation apart from a load of quibbles that would only get in the way of the film's momentum. Reportedly, Lynch lensed this concise little gem in Serbia."
