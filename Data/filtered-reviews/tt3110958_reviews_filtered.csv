" Unforgettable genius story!
",2021-03-05 00:00:00,10,Emotion tops! Thats it! üíüYou know THE cliffs before. But they tweaked it to another level AGAIN!
" The magic is gone.
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,4,"It usually is difficult for a sequel to live up to its predecessor. With 'Now you see me 2' I think they just tried too hard.The film picks up where the original left off - although now a year later. All the same characters are back, except Henley (Isla Fisher). I think this was their first mistake. They should have created an entirely new story around the Four Horseman, instead of treading on the past. The first film was mysterious and exciting. Now, they attempt to make it more complicated, and concentrate more on The Eye - quite frankly which added more confusion than answers.There's also far too many comedy elements, hence I didn't take it very seriously. The film is also laden with 'magic tricks' that's simply too unbelievable. The more they tried to explain them, the more ridiculous they were. (Especially the card trick scene when they stole the chip, and the plane scene...!!!). The plot also doesn't really offer anything new. It's pretty much a same old, same old premise - only with magic tricks here and there.The finale wasn't all that bad, although the reveal is not believable at all. I generally enjoy Daniel Radcliffe's post Harry Potter work, but he wasn't convincing in the role of one of the film's antagonists, Walter. With Michael Caine back as Tressler, and Morgan Freeman as Thaddeus Bradley, the film gave me a sense of deja vu. There was little excitement and the film wasn't as fast-paced. Quite frankly, the magic is gone."
" Box Office Hungry
",2021-02-03 00:00:00,2,"For a movie about magicians, the behind the scenes crew did not do much to disguise the fact that this movie was box office fishing at its finest. Relying on the success of the first edition, in no way, shape or form is this movie executed well at any point. The reluctant 2 points given are merely earned by the natural abilities of Woody Harrelson. But not even he could stop me from wishing I had watched 2 hours of amateur YouTube magicians instead.A yack of a film."
" Such GARBAGE!!!!!!
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,1,"I made an account just to review this movie. This is one of the worst I've ever seen. Complete junk. I spent $4 to watch this on Redbox and wish I could file for a refund.
It's. That. Bad."
" Fantastic 5.
",2021-01-21 00:00:00,9,"Fantastic 4 adding chatterbox and funny Lizzy.
9 stars, because it wasn't quite as good as the first movie.
Also fun, intriguing and keeps you guessing. Definitely not predictable."
" Now you see me leaving the theater too üèÉüí®
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,3,"Harry potter is a meanie who, despite being a wizard, uses no magic in this film. Batman's butler, alfred, was in the movie too.The card throwing scene stretched on for too long, by the end of it I felt like i had been through the 100 years war. It was slightly redeemed when the lady took off her bra tho.*bumps into you pushing you inside a chinese dragon* lookatthebuttonthatsaysyespressthebuttonpleasethisisallihaveinthisworldineedmorehelpfulreviewstokeepmeafloat"
" Horrible
",2021-01-14 00:00:00,1,This is one of the worst films I've ever seen at least terminator took 3 entries to really go down hill this took 1 now you see me is one of my favourite films of all time and this is one of my least favourite films of all time Daniel Radcliffes performance rivals Jared Leto's joker for most botched performance one of the main characters left after the first movie replacing her with a way less good actor and giving basically no reason for her to be dead and they only do magic in the last 15 minutes of the film this is the most disappointing film I've ever seen and the worst sequel! 1/10 keep in mind I gave the original a 10/10
" Disappointing
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,5,"The sequel was disappointing compared to the first film. The story lacks vision and imagination. The only thing that was interesting and worth watching was the card trick used to steal the stick. Besides that it was all down hill.
Jack Wilder is seen in two different places at once. Jack is playing three card Monty and then seen as he hypocrites Chase on a bridge."

" Potter in stead of plot
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,4,The first was muah. This is worse. Budget went out on Harry Potter in stead of a plot.
" Do You Like Con Shows?
",2020-12-28 00:00:00,8,"How much you like 'Now You See Me 2' depends on how much you like 'Leverage', 'Mission: Impossible', 'The Sting', 'Maverick', etc. The protagonists are magician, but so was Rollin Hand in the early seasons of 'M:I'. And most cons rely on the same thing the magicians do here: make the mark(s) look in one direction, and pull off their tricks in a different direction.'NYSM2' is just a con movie, but with the various magicians filling in the con roles. They toss a computer chip around on a playing card, but that isn't any different from a bunch of pickpockets pulling the same scam at the end. And the ""throw 'em out the airplane' gag at the end is the kind of thing you'd see in most of those shows.The cast is likeable enough, and the bad guys are swarmy jerks. Almost everyone snarks, but that's pretty typical for this type of genre.Woody Harrelson doesn't have much to do except provide some ""hypnosis"" and goofiness. Which is probably why they gave his character a twin brother, who the fact that he's a twin brother really doesn't _do_ anything. Caplan and Radcliffe, as the newcomers, are pretty good. Freeman and Caine are the old-timers, who are okay. Eisenberg is his usual self. Franco doesn't have much to do. Everyone else is... there, but don't make a big splash.Overall, the movie is entertaining. It's not as convoluted as some of those aforementioned shows' plots: it's a little dumbed-down for a 21st century audience. And it's got all of the usual American theatrical plot points: Dylan is still avenging his father, and ""this time it's personal!"" what with Caine and thus Radcliffe's characters looking for payback. But you'll have to pay attention, and some of the ""stage magic"" isn't. Like Atlas and Wilder disappearing in puddles of water/flinging cards, etc.But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong. What do you think?"
" The first cardtrick is kinda freaky!! DIF anyone guessed the wrong one???
",2020-12-23 00:00:00,8,The first cardtrick is kinda freaky!! DIF anyone guessed the wrong one???
" It's better than the overall grade suggests but...
",2020-12-10 00:00:00,7,"The first time I watched this movie I was still in high school and I loved it. Four years later, I'm constantly recommending it to my younger sister (who is still in high school) but I'm not as big fan as I once was. All the fun, magic bits are still kinda fun but I guess it's true that magicians should never reveal their secrets.Characters are less interesting than I remember, with Lula being the biggest disappointment. She is no longer this cool, outspoken and loud character I wanted to be like - she is just loud now. And for all the future script writers, one way too make a female characters be ""like all the other girls"" is to make her state that she is not, in fact, ""like all the other girls"". Btw, I finally understand why everyone keeps saying that Jesse Eisenberg acts like he doesn't know ""Social Network"" is over.Furthermore, as far as I can remember, all other important movie bits (background, costumes, script for like 75% of time) were perfectly fine. Or rather, perfectly fine for when you have nothing else to watch."
" Barely entertaining, what a let down
",2020-12-05 00:00:00,5,"I really didn't expect much from the first one and really liked it, which might be why this one disappointed more than it should as I had good expectations. While the actors are still doing a good job, the whole thing is pushing suspension of disbelief past the point of acceptable, and everything is quite predictable especially the ""twists"" and tricks, which is major issue when that's all your movie is about. Unless you are really bored and have nothing else to watch, I'd pass on this."
" Less magic in this sequel
",2020-11-23 00:00:00,6,"Eighteen months after escaping from the FBI, the Four Horsemen return. Their mission is to expose the corrupt CEO of a tech company whose latest phone will harvest data to sell on the black market. One again all is not what it seems.Sequel to the 2013 original, the cast largely reunites for this new escapade which once again was a hit at the box office. However, this one is more miss than hit but there is enough action and fun to make it watchable, even if it is a little overlong."
" Poor quality follow-up.
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,6,"Sadly, this has neither the charm nor the originality of the first film - even despite the efforts of veteran's Sir Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman. Mark Ruffalo and the four horsemen are vying with each other and a really mis-cast Dan Radcliffe to try and procure a secret chip that could decrypt and control just about everything from government secrets to your steam iron. The action scenes are repetitive and go on too long, and the comic touches from the first film have been thrown under the bus somewhat. Woody Harrelson has become even more annoying and though Jesse Eisenberg tries hard, and for the most part still manages to keep it off the rocks, there is precious little for Dave Franco or Lizzy Caplan to get their teeth into. Does not bode well for the third instalment - the plot seam is already pretty much exhausted and what was an interesting concept in the first film has been subsumed into a visual effects-fest with very little substance."
" Highly Recommended
",2020-10-28 00:00:00,10,"As a matter of fact, this movie soooooooooo amazing, and It was one of the best movies I saw, i highly recommended don't miss it..."
" Yes You Saw Me...Now See Me Again
",2020-10-28 00:00:00,6,"This is essentially the same movie as the first.Its still entertaining, the characters are fun, especially Woody but they basically took the ingredients of one cake, moved them around a little and made another cake. I love cake but aside from making coin I feel like this movie needed more of an artistic reason to exist.Its same same but enjoyable :)"
" I enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed the original film
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,7,"Now You See Me 2 is a 2016 mystery thriller starring Jessie Eisenberg(The Social Network),Mark Ruffalo (13 Going On 30),Morgan Freeman(Bruce Almighty) and Woody Harrelson (Zombieland).The story picks off after it was revealed that Dylan(Ruffalo) is an illusionist as well as an FBI agent and he must track down the horsemen from a former magician(Daniel Radcliffe from Harry Potter fame) who wants the horsemen to retrieve a chip.
If you love Inception then you'll probably like this too. It's one of those films where you have to pay close attention too or you'll be scratching your head and not knowing what is going on"
" The 4 Horesemen...
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,5,"Rock! A very good escapist film worthy of attention; however, whatever inspired the casting director to choose Savannah Guthrie for a role in this picture is a real bona fide head-shaker...a more bland-looking, talentless soccer mom weighed down by great heaps of ho-hum never dragged its dessicated carcass across the screen as her,; no doubt, this project would have been better served by utilizing her suspect'skills' by running her off-set for bear claws, juice and dunkins coffee. Hollywood...please, please spare us from exposure to such gross mediocrity. It is bad enough that her voice and visage must be seen, daily, on (N)umbskulls (B)oring the (C)ommunity....hire a monkey in her stead."
" Uninteresting, hurried and loaded with clich√©s.
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,3,"There are several films about the world of magic and illusionism available, and many are great. This film is just one more, and it followed one of the best, to reveal itself as one of the worst.The story is simple: after the events of the first film, the Horsemen separate and wait for instructions from the Eye. However, if some get tired and give up, others insist. Finally, they are summoned to expose the secrets of a new technological application but everything goes wrong: exposed to the world, they flee and end up in Macau, where they will have to find out who is the person who betrayed them.What can I say about this film? That many of the most interesting and entertaining features of the first film have simply disappeared. Director Jon M. Chu was able to reveal himself to be a nullity by making a hasty film, full of unrealistic and imaginative situations, as well as clich√©s like the evil twin or the illegitimate son who wants to please his father. Even as a piece of entertainment, this film is quite weak and unable to honor its predecessor.The cast is inherited from the previous film, with few modifications, but they are at a distance from giving us a good job because they weren't entitled to some decent material. So, we have again Jesse Eisenberg, more arrogant than in the first film, James Franco and Woody Harrelson, who will also give life to his character's presumptuous twin brother (a stupid script option, at the very least). Mark Ruffalo, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine also returned to their characters, and I would say that they are the best actors here. The problem is that they could not do anything to improve the film given that they did not have much visibility (Freeman and Ruffalo, who appear only when necessary, are really underused sometimes). The exit of Isla Fisher (quite intelligent given that she saved herself from a film that would not add anything good to her career) was filled by the entrance of Lizzy Caplan, as a fun character that makes you smile, adding moments of spontaneity and irreverence to a film that, without it, would be more boring. The villain was incarnated by Daniel Radcliffe, but he looks like a cynical caricature, and I was never able to take him seriously.Technically, it's a fairly regular film: on the positive side, I would highlight cinematography, with a good work of light and color, enhanced by the authentic color of the streets of Macau, a former Portuguese colony in China where much of the film takes place. The sets and costumes are good enough and there is some realism and verisimilitude in CGI and in visual and sound effects. The soundtrack, it seemed to me, is inherited from the previous film with few modifications."
" Loved it!
",2020-10-15 00:00:00,10,Not going to say much about it but didn't want it to end! Can't wait for the 3rd
" Bad, Bad, Bad.
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,2,"The first movie was enjoyable, but had to believe, especially the ending. However, this piece of junk discards everything that movie worked toward. The plot twists, the misguided revenge, nothing from the first movie is retained. I made it to the end, but I had to force myself. Perfect example of taking an enjoyable premise and trashing it for the sake of a sequel."
" Not the best
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,5,"Not a very good storyline, was quite cliche and not that much magic scenes. Bunch of good actors, but poor storyline"

" Makes the first movie worse!
",2020-08-26 00:00:00,4,When a movie alters the story of the first movie and makes it worse... This is that movie.
" It's good.
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,8,"It's good, not as good as the original but it's a worthy sequel. It's also the only movie you get the hulk fighting Harry Potter and alfred."
" And for their next trick...
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,4,"Still wanted by the FBI for a money heist, a band of talented magicians find themselves kidnapped and wake up in Macao by those they stole from who are now threatening the group unless they carry out an audacious heist for them.This sequel to the 2013 original film is marginally better and is slick and glossy. But the magic tricks, like the CGI is not clever, but showy, as we all know this will always be CGI and the magic illusion of cinema. In other words it is all polish and no substance. Daniel Radcliffe makes for a gratingly annoying villain, while Caine sleep walks through his standard late career cameo performance."
" Not what expected but...
",2020-07-03 00:00:00,5,"At the end of the day it entertains the audience, it surely does but it is better not to go with high expectations if you loved the first one, I'd say it's harder to watch because of the repetitive narrative that ends in a mess, don't get me wrong...it's still bold with the whole ""magic theme"" in order to apply it in a criminal stage.I didn't enjoyed it as much as the first one but I'm still excited for the 3rd part."
" Bad, just bad
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,2,"Does not live up to the first one. The plot is bad and all over the place. And repeating same plot as previous on so not much originality. I couldnt finish it to the end, stopped it like first 30 mins."
" Oceans X-Men 2
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,6,"I like magic, I like heist movies... And this one, much like the first one, is a combination of those two. I just wish it had a bit more interesting ideas. It's a fun movie, but very predictable and sometimes a bit disappointing. Also the twist at the end kind of ruined the entire film for me because it comes out of absolutely nowhere and makes zero sense when you think back to all the events of these movies, but everyone just acts like it's a normal tuesday night. With all that being said, I still had fun watching it and if you turn off your brain and just let the movie entertain you, it's fine."
" So lame!
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,2,"What is wrong with the Hollywood writers lately?! There is a multitude of bad scripts and this movie is based on one of them. The ploy is convoluted and barely believable and the acting is subpar.
I lost interest in the movie within 30 minutes.
Pure crap!"
" Stop making this nonsense!!!!
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,3,"Big letdown from the first one. Too many twists one on top of each other, and gives the impression that the writer was trying too hard on this one. A classic example of overthinking. The card scene was bordering on absurdity, not to mention the airplane trick. Like nobody on the plane noticed? Seriously? Not even during takeoff? Ridiculous!"
" And Now You See A Pile of Poop
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,3,"I'm baffled that this film received more than four stars. I got about 20 minutes into the first one and bailed. Stinky #2 got on my nerves from the opening scene, then I dozed off, then I woke up when there was some loud street fight. I watched about ten more minutes and said ""fk this"". Am I the only one annoyed by the 'no biggie' attitudes of the main characters? I never felt like they were truly in danger. It's just one boring, chaotic dress rehearsal. I picture a twelve year old sitting in the director's chair. This film, and the one before it, are Romper Room mayhem and there's nothing appealing about the script or the acting. Very disappointing. I shouldn't have been foolish enough to think the sequel would be any better, so I take responsibility for being suckered twice. At least I didn't spend a penny to see either one. I still wasted my time, other than when I dozed off. It's crap, don't bother with this movie."
" Ignored the bad reviews...
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,7,"I ignored the bad reviews, went along for the ride and had a good time!"
" The third one MUST be called ""Now You Don't""
",2020-05-07 00:00:00,9,"I felt like this second installment was stretched to a comedy, but still has what made the first movie great. Whatever that is. I love it."
" Now You See Me 2 (2016)
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,8,"Now You See Me (2013) was unique. It stirred movie goers due to it's amazing perspective on magic.The sequel keeps it going. It expands the whole universe and the magic too.The story unfolds when the payback comes from the other side. The victims of the prequel are now going against the four horsemen.The new expansive universe of the film franchise and magic is striking, mind bending and visually stunning.An amazing personal film experience.Highly recommended.
Overall - 4/5"

" STUPID AND UNNECESSARY
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,3,"If the first one was a little over mediocrity, this one is very bad. The writing is very bad, with a lot of plot holes and nonsense things. It was clicked, dumb and an unnecessary sequel. The acting was unimpressive and Daniel Radcliffe was horrible."
" Seems to have very little purpose or direction
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,3,"The original Now You See Me was not a masterpiece. It had a fun idea and fun characters to go along with it, but it also felt muddled. For example, the whole shadowy organization, The Eye, behind it all felt completely unnecessary. The movie could just have been a fun little heist movie with four magicians deciding to get rich by using their talents. There was absolutely no need to throw in bargain bin Illuminati with rumours of real magic.And of course that bargain bin Illuminati is exactly what they chose to focus on in the sequel. Because of course it was. Gone are the quippy one-liners, gone is the flash and razzle dazzle, gone is the magic. Instead our main characters are on the run. It's all very dark and grim. You can trust no one and the police is right on their tails. Instead of them being two steps ahead of everyone else - you know, the fact that made the previous film so fun to watch - now they're constantly two steps behind. Of course they'll prevail by the end - it's still a movie - but it doesn't feel earned.And let me raise one gripe above others. There's very little magic in this film. Towards the end we start seeing them pull shows once more, and at point it becomes interesting, but before that, almost nothing.Okay, there's one very long scene with card tricks and more specifically card throwing, but that felt so pointlessly unneeded and complicated that it become unintentionally hilarious. If you don't want other people finding the card you're holding, perhaps don't throw it across the room a million times.That being said, the actors were still very enjoyable. Mark Ruffalo gets a lot more screen time this time around and his subplot was the most enjoyable by a wide margin. Perhaps more of that would have fixed the film. Then again, I came to this film to see the Horsemen, so having even less of them could also be very bad.Not a good sequel. Usually these things try to cram too much of what made the previous film work down our throats, but this falls into that other dangerous category: not knowing what made the previous film so good."
" Expect The Unexpected!
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,8,"Now You See Me 2 refreshing but not surprising as the first one, tries to be entertaining as the first one but it doesn't reach the same level, i could say every opportunity was taken to deliver the best vibe as before, the team is back with the good cast and (Daniel Radcliffe) was added it was surprisingly great but unfortunately (Isle Fisher)s role was taken by (Lizzy Caplan) she can't totally live the role she doesn't suit it, the story was questionable and not clear, i will keep my expectations high as there is a third movie on way, highly recommended if you were a fan of the first one you will enjoy this one too, 7.5/10‚≠ê"
" I thought it was a bit better than the first
",2020-03-09 00:00:00,7,"I thought the first movie was decent, but was boring and confusing at times, however that wasn't the case for this movie. I found the plot intriguing throughout and was easy to follow for the most part; the ending was a bit confusing though. I also thought that it was a bit for fun and entertaining compared to the first movie which got boring for me during the middle and towards the end of that movie. The action and magic scenes were good, although there wasn't that many magic tricks compared to the first movie. Overall, it's a decent movie depending on the type of movies you're into."
" I like 'Now You See Me 2' more than the film it follows

There are a few silly scenes, like the one that involves Henry Lloyd-Hughes, but even those are still entertaining. Daniel Radcliffe is good in this, too."
" Great sequel
",2020-02-05 00:00:00,10,"The acts just get better. After the events of the first film, the horsemen get played by tressler. But who's playing who?"
" Unnecessary Sequel, But Still Fun
",2020-01-20 00:00:00,6,"Yeah, this was entirely unnecessary considering how poorly the first movie was recieved (though I personally loved it). That said, it does delve deeper into the personalities and relationships of the horsemen, particularly Dylan and Danny (Mark Ruffalo and Jesse Eisenberg respectively).The addition I did not appreciate (though understood) was Lulu. My goodness, this girl was annoying. Half of her lines are sexual innuendo that grated on my nerves.Aside from her, the actual movie was fun and reminiscent of the first movies. While not a breakthrough storyline, the visuals and acting are fun and enjoyable. I'd still recommend this if you liked the first movie."
" Lots of surprises
",2019-12-16 00:00:00,7,"I like the fact that unlike many new movies, it is slow and has meaningful conversations and smooth transitions. Compared to it's prequel it has less actions and chasings but still has good magic tricks. I love the movie but the way the story ended, had me unsatisfied and in my opinion, it is the weakest part of the whole series. I wish it had a better ending, storywise."
" Enjoyable
",2019-12-09 00:00:00,8,"An enjoyable magic movie. Some of the acting is questionable as are some of the action scenes, but it is a fun, easy going movie to watch. I did find some of the heroes a bit smug and annoying actually and kind of wanted them at times to get caught. Not as good as the original but still a good watch."
" Stupid movie
",2019-12-03 00:00:00,3,"This is a stupid movie! It is just as bad as the first one was good!
Unbelieveable bad script, like really, really awful."
" The Horsemen.

I am really excited for it's sequel and I wish the title should include ""The Horsemen""."
" Magic

" Can't wrap my head around this thing
",2019-11-03 00:00:00,5,"Who knows what, who is tricking whom?? Everyone is everywhere when the plot requires. Idk what the hell is Morgan Freeman's role in both the movies. FBI is shown so stupid their helplessness is laughable. People are cheering criminals.
They didn't even try to keep it a bit realistic."
" Plenty of magic... just not magical
",2019-10-30 00:00:00,6,"These comments assume you've seen the first film so don't need further details about returning characters.Eighteen months have passed since the group of magicians known as 'The Four Horseman' outwitted the FBI and robbed their previous sponsor, Arthur Tressler; now they are about to stage their return. Well three of them are, Henley Reeves has been replaced by new girl Lula May. They plan to use their skills to expose a plot to steal personal data from anybody buying a new piece of software... things don't go to plan and the four must flee. Things take a surprising turn as they slide down a chute from a New York rooftop and land in a restaurant in Macau! Here Merritt McKinney is bet by his brother, and enemy, Chase, who takes them to Walter Mabry, a former employee of Chase who wants them to steal a chip that will give him access to any computer. Meanwhile their associate, FBI Special Agent Dylan Rhodes is on their tail along with Thaddeus Bradley, the man they left to rot in jail. What follows is a succession of magic tricks that culminate in a final reveal in London on New Year's Eve as they face an old adversary.If the plot sounds a bit convoluted that is because it is at times. In a way that doesn't matter as it is there to provide and excuse for magic tricks and misdirection. Unfortunately this is often a problem as many of the tricks require the viewer to accept that a person can unwittingly be hypnotised in an instant or believe in tricks that clearly rely on CGI or other special effects. Also some of the tricks go on too long; notably how they pass the stolen chip between each other as they are searched. On the plus side, if you can suspend your disbelief, there are plenty of fun moments... I particularly liked Lula's simple bit rather disturbing tricks. The cast is solid and clearly having fun; that fun is infectious at least while watching the film. Once it was over I felt it had passed the two hours well enough but imagine most of it will soon be forgotten. Overall hardly a must see but fun enough."
" Now I'm Waiting for the Grand Show!
",2019-10-27 00:00:00,8,"The movie was great! I'm expecting to see its second sequel, but please more Magic Thefts and more Surprising Misdirections and Unexpected Happenings please!"
" Bad title
",2019-10-21 00:00:00,6,"Not sure why they didn't name this ""And now you don't."" Huge lost opportunity."
" Should never make Sequel
",2019-10-08 00:00:00,2,"What is this? bad story, no twist,bad ilusion and magic. Who wrote this trash.Henley just gone like that,and come lula. What for? what exactly her role? just flying the pigeon?
how about jay chou? standing,be there and be cool .
The Horsemen here all just fool, not like 1st movie they are full of skill,proud of them self and doing just fine alone,here, they are just a little tief that got played by everyone and tossed here and there.
Atlas has no brain, Jack best show was his hypnose? , Merrit clumsy and no strength.
The card trick,when they stealing the chip is way too long ,bad trick and unrealistic,not funny,no excitment, who would get tricked like that?
This movie has no momentum, no character. All is absurd."
" Worthwhile watching
",2019-10-01 00:00:00,7,"If you like entertainment, then this is worth watching. Might not be as good as the 1st one but whilst stuff like this seems implausible, that's the purpose of movies, or at least some of them-make believe! An interesting story line with good against ""not good"" and an interesting finale which may come as a surprise. Lets hope if you do ""no 3"" its better than this one and just as good as the 1st. Lizzie Caplan is a good substitute for Isla Fisher!"
" Not good
",2019-09-14 00:00:00,6,Well it was kinda just kinda good but not like the first sequel
" A Farfetched Sequel... Not As Enjoyable Or Magical As The Original...
",2019-09-11 00:00:00,6,"What made the first film so good hinders this sequel. Trying to rival the original story's complexity, ingenuity, and content the writers, Ed Solomon and Peter Chiarelli, decided to go down the ancient secret organisation route. This makes it similar to John Wick's universe, though it's not handled so well. Whereas it's assassins in Wick, it's magicians and tricksters who are the secret hero watchmen.You can just about believe a group of five people trying to make the world a better place. But make this into a shadow agency... of magicians and you're asking a lot of your audience. Also making it a continuation of the original instead of a new stand-alone story wasn't the best of ideas. Especially when you start to change the morality of the characters.The director, Jon M Chu, does a fantastic job with the mess the writers gave him. In particular the electronic skeleton key theft. On paper, and in your mind, this entire routine is ridiculous in its absurdity. However, in Chu's hands, it comes off respectfully and almost believable. In truth, it's Chu who is the glue to this film. Without his, or similar directors, deft touch this movie would have been dire indeed.The acting is passable, though only Eisenberg and Harrelson go the extra distance. Eisenberg is spot-on as the assertive, confident, and powerful showman. Harrelson adds an extra dimension by also playing Merritt's twin brother and ex-partner Chase. He pulls the two personalities perfectly. The way they play off each other is great. It's Freeman, Caine, and Radcliffe that are the weaker actors. This could be down to the writing of the characters or how the director saw them. Freeman's Thaddeus Bradley isn't as well constructed in the sequel. I think this is down to the fact that he's now a minor background character. Caine does his Caine thing, though it would have been nice to see a softer side when he's with his son. Radcliffe doesn't do bad guy. In fact, with the beard he sports, I'm amazed the horsemen weren't rolling on the floor with laughter. If you have that amount of money wouldn't you have a well-styled and trimmed set of whiskers?I would only recommend that you watch this film if you've watched and enjoyed the original. If you haven't seen the first yet, get it watched - it's a good movie - then, only if you're at a loose end with nothing to watch, you can give this a try. It's not as good, though on a cold wet afternoon it isn't a bad alternative to a soaking bicycle ride."
" Magicians of mediocrity
",2019-09-04 00:00:00,6,"""Now you see me 2"" doesn't shine. The first chapter tried to innovate the thriller genre unifying illusionism and robbers, creating a funny entertaining movie. The second one isn't able to do the same thing: the magic is used just as a spectacular thing to make the events more catchy, but the plot remains weak and without strong points. Characters, especially the one acted by Ruffalo, results pale and without a clear moral position. Anonymous."
" Doesn't match the original film

" It was ok, but missing Isla Fisher
",2019-07-18 00:00:00,5,"It was an alright follow up. The ending dragged on a bit. It just wasn't the same without Isla Fisher. Don't get me wrong Lizzy Caplan is good, but the movie would have been so much better with the complete original cast."
" Reasonable heist flick at the start. Totally falls apart at the end.
",2019-07-10 00:00:00,4,"Every time someone tries to shoehorn Morgan Freeman into one of these genre knockoffs (Ocean's 11 knockoff in this case; that 'Wanted' one he did with Angelina Jolie was some kind of Da Vinci Code-esque piece of cheese with The Loom of Destiny at the end), the whole thing just goes sideways.This was a perfectly serviceable stylish-if-not-believable heist movie until the last half-hour when the supposed 'reveals' introduce about a million plot holes and 'WTF?s' until you wish it'd just be over already, because it's killing whatever positive feelings you managed to have about it.If you're in the mood for a heist film, go watch Ocean's 11, 12, 13 or 8. Any of them are better than this, even the ones that critics said were disappointments."
" my notes
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,3,"While the first movie had some questionable parts and things that are hard to believe, this movie just went completely over the top with things that don't make any sense. if you tried to pick apart this movie, it would just be full of flaws, plot holes, and things that just seem impossible. they just tried to make it bigger like with most sequels, and it didn't work. I absolutely HATED the addition of the character Chase, and i didn't really like the replacement for Isla Fisher. Although watching the first one again, Isla fisher is the worst part of the movie IMO. (1 viewing)"
" the closer you look, the less you see!
",2019-06-27 00:00:00,10,Made me believe that magic is real. I was awed. Made me WOW the entire time watching this. Waiting for part 3

" Now You Don't
",2019-04-28 00:00:00,6,The sequel of a mediocre magic movie but this time with a different female actress and a much more interesting villain played by Daniel Radcliffe. Daniel Radcliffe allows the series to go from a group vs. the government to them actually having a villain to antagonize them. It attempts to develop the overall plot following the order of magic people set up in the first one but sacrifices some of the characters charm to do so. The development of Mark Ruffalo's character is good but makes little sense that it is only now being introduced rather than already being established earlier. In general it seems to be a kind of duplicate to the first but very slightly worse.
" Not quite as good as the 1st but damn close!!
",2019-04-26 00:00:00,8,"Put off watching this after reading a review stating 'Sadly, this lacks the charm, wit and, yes, magic of the original. You'll like it, just not a lot. ""Totally disagree. While not QUITE as good as the 1st (seriously, how many sequels are?) it comes damn close.
Fabulously entertaining, great to see this cast back together, they work off each other so well. The story-line & dialog terrific, the card switching shtick particularly memorable.
Pure unadulterated entertainment, let's hope for a ""Now You See Me 3""."
" Don't ""coming soon""
",2019-04-23 00:00:00,7,"The second part is done well. But still I think that the first part was made better and more initiative. With regards to the two parts as a whole. Then in the first part there are questions whose answers are hidden in the second part of the film. And in the second part there are questions whose answers are hidden in the first part. Interesting puzzle.
I don't think it's a good idea to keep filming. Since the material is already set out as clearly as possible."
" Waste of time
",2019-04-05 00:00:00,1,"I don't know, why I've watched this after the first one was meh. Number two was really number two. Total nonsense and waste of time."
" Just as good as the first!
",2019-04-01 00:00:00,10,Now You See Me and Now You See Me 2 are a couple of my all time favorite movies that I keep in rotation for nights that I can find something else to watch.This one was just as good as the first although I do miss Isla Fisher. The cast is still great and they work well as a team.
" A star each for Caine, Ruffalo, Freeman - 0 for the movie
",2019-03-25 00:00:00,3,"What's more annoying than Woody Harrelson? Woody Harrelson playing a dual role - so double the silly smirky strutting. Add in the new trope kooky girl who is a typical millennial casting - self-consciously grasping to be clever, mouthy and loud with nothing intelligent to say. (How many of THOSE do you have in your office?) We're asked to suspend belief that any of their tricks can be done - especially the ""hypnosis"" thing - so the least they can do is not aggravate us with the casting. I really liked the first movie - but will not watch #3."
" Still enjoyable with the same bag of tricks.
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,7,"Sometimes the enjoyment of a particular film almost guarantees I'll go to see the sequel. Now You See Me 2 (2016) is no exception. I really liked Now You See Me (2013) because the genres of ""magic"" and ""heist"" merge so easily together. Now three years later, and I certainly looked forward to this sequel, despite not knowing how the plot could advance any further than it had at the end of the first film.While the sequel did not disappoint, with numerous illusions, plenty of action, and loads of comedy, it felt like it was the same old gimmick as the original. Sure, there was a little more exploration into ""the Eye"", but most of the plot of the second film centered on the consequences of the robberies from the first film (almost weighing it down, in my opinion). The addition of Daniel Radcliffe as a winking nod to his Harry Potter character was fun as a reveal, but didn't offer much in terms of plot development. In fact, I almost liked Woody Harrelson playing twin brothers more, but that's likely due to the comedic value.Unfortunately, because Now You See Me 2 focused almost entirely on the background of Agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo), I felt it was held back to its full potential. None of the other characters really grew that much, but they were rewarded for working together (after running into a few snags), much like they did in their first appearance on screen. Don't get me wrong, the formula works for me and I was entertained, but maybe this franchise would have been better served as a TV series instead of a potential film trilogy.Still enjoyable with the same bag of tricks, I give Now You See Me 2 3.5 stars out of 5."
" In short, it's not a qualified sequel.
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,6,"The effect of the picture is still very good, but unfortunately there are other shortcomings: magic design slowly slides to the effect of not reasonable, the plot is also to reverse in order to cover up the hard pull, the rhythm is intermittent. In short, it's not a qualified sequel."
" Dont think to much
",2019-02-17 00:00:00,6,"If you let yourself go with the flow of the movie you will notice you will enjoy yourself. Good acting, good effects, good timing, all beter then the first instalmentBut any form of critical analys, or even thinking during the movie will ruin the complete experience. The script is abysmal, some scenes dont make sense and often undermines it own setups.So just dont think."
" Should have been called a film slightly inspired by Now You See Me!!
",2019-01-29 00:00:00,1,"One of the best films I have seen in recent years was 'Now You See Me'. Brilliant film, lots of wonder and twists, an excellent movie. This however is a very very poor sequel, where is the magic, the awe, the twists, the things we loved from the first movie? The only thing that stood out was Daniel Washington's performance which was every bit as good as the first movie. But take that 2 minutes out of the movie and the rest was very disappointing."
" Frodo loses from the eye!
",2019-01-21 00:00:00,9,Different script than Tolkien used. This time frodo loses from the eye. A secret society of wizards that do magictricks. :)

" I enjoyed it!
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,9,"Again interesting enough to me.. Misdirection, confusion, desertion, & I still couldnt predict. Both in the 1st movie & in this one I was assuming Strikers father was still alive. Funny thing is will there be a part 3 maybe called ""Now You Don't"" & will his father be alive then?
Speculation is all I have."
" 2018-12-10
",2018-12-11 00:00:00,6,Too much special effect made this movie too unreal which is not in a good way. Watched this because I had a good impression of the 1st Now You See Me. Sad that it ended up disappointed.
" Not as good as the 1st but still fun
",2018-12-06 00:00:00,7,"If you liked the 1st film, you'll find this enjoyable but not as good ! I liked the links to the 1st film but, have to admit, there was something not quite the same in this sequel."
" 6
",2018-12-03 00:00:00,6,"Average movie, kind of liked it but it's really messy and when I'm saying messy it means that there are too many things happening at once so the film is getting bland and can't attract audience attention."
" JUST PERFECT!
",2018-11-05 00:00:00,10,"There's nothing else to say, really. The actors, the plot, the suspence, everything, is so well planned out, you don't see any, like any, of the plt twists happening. Tbh, in the beginning I was not that pumped that Isla wasn't going to be in the movie (like, my ship n all), but God. Lizzie Kaplan. She was just perfect. And then, another ship was created and wow. I feel like there's NOTHING negative anyone can say about this movie. I adore it!"
" Sequel that is equal in suspense and twists!
",2018-10-29 00:00:00,10,Quite often sequels are normally a let down as the original is always the best however in this case not so! This sequel is as slick suspenseful and wonderfully acted top class for drama thrills and suspense with magic thrown in what else could you want!
" Come on?
",2018-10-15 00:00:00,8,"The irony lies in the fact a lot of 'reviewers' have the audacity to say other 'reviewers' are wrong. I studied film at university, so i know what i'm talking about. I thought it was entertaining (granted plot holes) but who cares, i just wanted a popcorn action/thriller/comedy to enjoy. And guess what? i did. Get off your high horses as you have no idea as to what you are talking about, it was about pace and juxtaposition between characters, elements that are vital in film. A beginning, middle and an end (if you follow those rules) Ivory towers indeed."
" ""I wonder which one of us gets to play the bimbo"".
",2018-10-03 00:00:00,7,"I probably need to see this more than once to get the full nuance of what's going on with the Four Horsemen, but I just don't have the patience. If anything, the picture is just as slick and entertaining as the original, but with boatloads of incredulous stuff that wouldn't be nearly possible in real life. Like that entire card sleight of hand sequence in Macau - not a single slip up, every throw perfectly synchronized, and clueless guards to make a getaway possible. The most thought that was put into this movie was someone's idea that the late Lionel Shrike owned a watch specifically made for him, with the name 'EPACSE' Chronograph printed inside the face. ""Escape' spelled backwards in case you missed it. And escape is pretty much what you're ready to do with all the dizzying special effects and CGI that makes real magic an impossibility. I'd rather watch Copperfield."
" A Sequel that Never Gives itself a Reason to Exist,
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,5,"Now You See Me 2 is a very mediocre film with a thin plot and a talented cast that are never given a chance to shine here. What the film does still offer is some visually terrific sequences, even when it can get convuluted, it is always fuj to see these magicians use their skills and it's a soecial thing this series has to offer that no other film series has. The plot is very flat, I really enjoyed the first Now You See Me and was looking forward to seeing how they continued this story, but they really did not try to break any boundaries or try to excel beyond any success they had with their predecessor, it was simoly by the numbers. The cast look like they are having fun, and that certainly makes it more watchable, but their is little to no scope added to their characters, we do not learn anything new or benefit in seeing them grow by watching this film, it offers little pay off. An uninteresting sequel. Lightly plotted and thinly developed, I would advise giving Now You See Me 2 a miss. 
The Four Horsemen are recruited to pull off an impossible heist. Best Performance: Mark Ruffalo"
" A nice fairytale
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,7,An updated fairytale among good and bad interesting tricks in the plot.. very good direction.. they were some gaps in the end.. but the message came through.
" The soundtrack by Brian Tyler, folks! The soundtrack!
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,7,"I could have written this review for 'Now You See Me I', as my appreciation for Tyler's work started there, but I thought I'd skip it, as he outdid himself in the second part. Yes, the NYSM films are arguably one of the most plot hole ridden franchises in Hollywood (not speaking about the non-decision if magic now is actually an existing thing or not), but strangely I found that after watching the first one and simply accepting the aforementioned fact I was able to really enjoy the second one. And I will re-view the first one as well with this attitude. Those are simply enjoyable films with good actors, nice scenery and lighthearted stories. But I want to direct your focus on something else I rarely read about here: The music by Brian Tyler. You may say about him what you want, but he really created an exception here. In our times, real pop-rock drums (I am not talking programmed drums and loops) as addition to orchestral music have fallen out of grace - Tyler was one of the first to bring them back. And boy, he knows how. In my world, the NYSM score is one of the most inventive soundtracks of our time. Not only does Tyler create a really powerful combination of orchestral and pop/rock music, he also manages to deliver a theme (or leitmotif) one is able to whistle after leaving the theater - also something that is not standard anymore, as soundtracks have become more like acoustic wallpaper these days. The music is really versatile in the most profound way. Just listen to 'The Setup' as a prime example. He morphs through all kinds of style from pop, rock, soul, swing and jazz in one single piece. And his real drums lend a power to the music that is unprecedented. Others have also started to incorporate this style of drumming in their music, but never as virtuosic as Tyler does here. If you like popcorn flicks, give the NYSMs try, and if you're into movie scores, keep your ears open. An oh, by the way: Listen to 'Can you dig it', his end title version of 'Iron Man 3' - it's right up there on the same level."
" Not as bad as reviews claim
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,7,"Now You See Me 2 is the sequel to hit original Now You See Me released in 2013. The film picks up a year later, with the Four Horsemen lying low, having formally joined secret magician society The Eye under Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo), an FBI mole and man behind the curtain to the events of the first movie. They're growing restless waiting for their next big assignment, while Rhodes plays dummy to distract the FBI. However, after they're joined by new horsewoman Lula (Lizzy Caplan) and given a mission to expose a tech magnate whose cell phones will phish private user info to buyers, things go awry. Soon, the Horsemen are separated from their mentor, plagued by enemies old and new around the world, and Rhodes has to team up with an old foe to sort out the mess.Although can be seen as both, though one of the biggest thing the sequel has over the first film is it tells an actual story instead of an incoherent setup to one. There's a big difference between mystery and confusion, and the first movie fell way on the confusion side, using twists to hide a muddled narrative. Here, we get to the actual concept: stage magicians using their talents to expose powerful crooks, liars, and thieves like a Vegas-bound Impossible Missions Force. Although this film may not be as suspenseful and mysterious as the original, where the final twist felt for organic and surprising, Now You See Me 2 isn't nearly as bad as some critics and reviews are claiming. There isn't much of a dropout in quality from the films."
" More Dull Than The First
",2018-07-31 00:00:00,2,"This was just a very boring and difficult to follow film. Lots of it didn't make sense, and if it wasn't for the ending, I would have given it 1/10.
Lizzy Kaplan is a good actress but her role was over sexualised, and not at all believable. Overall I did not particularly enjoy this film."
" Good Movie
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,8,I don't care about people who said this movie is bad. For me this movie again give me amazement in magic trick the horsemen did.
" Great overall but feminist bs hurts it a bit
",2018-07-24 00:00:00,6,"Great movie overall just like the first installment.. but everytime I see a movie getting a female character outta nowhere and taking the time to portray her as someone smarter than any of the of the guys.. and mocking them.. I just get facepalm.. 
First movie was great cause the red head was a great asset to the team and as important as the others.. that's it.. no feminist ""we can do it!"" mottos.. Notice you never see the other way around.. a guy being introduced in the story and ridiculing the female characters.. why? Because the harpies would freak out and label the movie chauvinist misoginist blablablaAnyway, still worth the couple of hours I spent watching it tho"
" Awful
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,1,"I expected bad, but i got mind numbing throw stuff at the screen shout profanities awful. 
Whoever wrote the screenplay needs to question their career choice. Same with the director. The actors did a good job at amplifying the dysfunctionality of this movie, so kudos to them i guess.
If the concept of suspension of disbelief came to life as a sentient being and watched this film it would immediately seek out the tallest building and leap off its roof.
I think the best thing about this movie is that it pretty much guarantees that there will not be a Now You See Me 3 (I hope)"
" This film is insulting
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,3,"When I went in the theatres with my friend I was excited I guess but it was a complete bore...none of the tricks made sense which added in so many plot wholes the acting was horrible and the cops basically just guessed where they were and there plan...and the ending even gets more confusing because the bad gay was a good guy all along and the guy they hacked was then on there side so why did they just do it then a there if they were good why did they need to go threw all of that because that film could of been 15 minutes long but it was more than an hour and a half because ""magic"" I guess I only give it 3 stars for the visuals."
" Entertaining
",2018-06-24 00:00:00,6,"I'll start by saying you'll probably need to watch the 1st part over again, it was difficult for me to remember who is who, the script should probably have included some sort of 'reminder'?
It is not a movie for oscar nominations nor will it be memorable but is entertaining all the same, a typical 'pop corn movie'. Nothing bad about it.
Some of the plot could have been simplified a bit, it looks like the writer needed to add some spice but it got a bit overdone.
Do not try to think what can be possible or not, is just a movie, a make believe thing to pass the time, not a tutorial video for magician :D"
" It does not quite do the trick
",2018-06-22 00:00:00,6,"This time, we know the horsemen are not common thieves. Their new mission goes awry however when it is hijacked by a petulant villain who forcibly uses them to retrieve the very same piece of tech they wanted to expose. 
How will they be able to achieve their goal and get out of the frying pan without jumping into the fire without their mentor around ?
If this does not sound very subtle, it is just because it isn't.We can't really worry about anything or care about the backstory. We can go along with the entertainment despite the feeling that everything will be alright in the end. The good guys will somehow defeat the childish villain and the evil twin (I kid you NOT) and everything will be explained. And that's the problem in a nutshell. No tricks or special effects can change the fact that it is pedestrian."
" Less confusing than the first one
",2018-06-21 00:00:00,10,The people that are still saying this movie is terrible is also the same people who still don't understand the movie itself.Though it did leave out a few details it is the best magical franchise of its kind.
" Entertaining but not magical
",2018-05-23 00:00:00,7,"2013's Now You See Me was a glossy cross-genre movie in which a group of four stage magicians - the Horsemen - created assorted illusions the purpose of which, it transpired, was to remove money from corrupt big business and return it, Robin Hood-style - to those from whom it has been stolen.This sequel reunites the cast (with the exception of Isla Fisher, whose token female place is taken by Lizzie Caplan), with the addition of Daniel Radcliffe, and this time they are on the defensive as things go somewhat awry. They have to figure out how to steal a high-tech bit of kit from a computer company, and various magic techniques are brought to bear in a rather improbable but very enjoyable robbery caper.The whole thing is rather improbable, to be frank, but that didn't spoil it: it's quite clever, and it's great fun, and that was quite sufficient to enable me to suspend my disbelief, especially throughout the rather silly but hugely enjoyable finale (they explained how the three card monte worked, but they never explained how Jesse Eisenberg did his disappearance).The cast are all fine - even Radcliffe, who seldom impresses me as an actor, is OK. The Horsemen work well as an ensemble, and there are some revelations which refer back to the first film, although you don't have to have seen it in order to appreciate them.It's not quite as good as its predecessor, but it's still great fun."
" Spoiler; this sucks
",2018-05-19 00:00:00,2,"I actually think this one is better than the first one, but I am sorry, it still sucks so much. I gave this film two stars because it was better than the first film, that just sucks in every way. This film actually had some feelings, it had some heart, but still, it just did NOT make sense! So stupid premise, so little purpose, so bad acting (except Michael Kane). I am Sorry, but this is just a bad film, and I hope you did not pay anything for it."
" Harry Potter VS. The 4 horse men
",2018-05-05 00:00:00,7,"Well what can I say? In my personal opinion the film is bit of an improvement over the last one. The magic effects were pretty. I liked the card that they did when they were having a security. The ending could have been better though. I like Daniel Radcliffe as an actor but if I had to be brutally honest I didn't really like him in this movie at all in terms of character and acting but he is good in the Harry Potter trilogy. Well if you enjoyed the last movie before, you might enjoy this. Can't wait for Now You See Me 3."
" It's a Parody - And People Missed That
",2018-05-02 00:00:00,7,"If you have any intelligence at all, you will, not only by seeing on IMDB page it says ""COMEDY"", but also, find by watching the film that is is a PARODY. For instance, there's (the actor of) Harry Potter that doesn't believe in magic and believes in science instead.The issue is though that in my opinion, FIRSTLY it should've tried even harder to make things go overboard, with all the effects and stuff. I mean the CGI is exactly the point to the parody -- but people also mistook it for a serious film because the film doesn't go crazy enough with it. SECONDLY, it's should've parodied all the characters heavier. The characters clearly are meant for parody as well but they don't strike you like that hard enough leaving the experience a little blunt.Don't skip the film just because unintelligent kids here couldn't figure out it's a parody.Overall, it's decent entertainment if you understand you are watching a comedy (parody), not a serious mystery film which it clearly doesn't claim to be."
" It was magical!
",2018-04-21 00:00:00,9,"I read some (not some,there a lot) very bad reviews about this movie but i can't understand there point.What i get that they were trying to say that there is another level of tricks in this movie and there is no explanation and they can't understand how things are happening.
Really?
Remember,if you can understand magic, then there is nothing like magic.
This is what this movie is about.BTW there is explanations for twists in this movie but who needs explanation for magic.If they tell you how they were performing those tricks,there will nothing remain like magic.
For Example,in action movies like Fast and Furious Series,there is not explanations for those impossible stunts like how a car can fly?Moreover Now you see me seires is all about magic.They are saying that they are showing magic.If people can easily umderstand their tricks,the purpose of movie would collapse.
So these points in these reviews are baseless.
Its like to watch harry potter and ask how they were performing magic.
Its against the definition of magic that you can understand it.
Come to the acting,almost all the cast is experienced and i found no issue with that.But i should say that the speed of the events occuring in the movie is bit high.Pace could be bit slow.Also i found some comments which were saying that this movie was looking all about tricks.
No it was not looking all about tricks it was really all about tricks.
It was a movie based on magical tricks.The difference was they give you story and yeah there is story which is also mgical.
In the end it was entertaining movie!
Note:Before watching this movie,you should make it clear in your mind that you're going to watch magic and after watching agian you shoud recall that you've watched magic!
Then there will be no questions in your mind like how those tricks were performed and you will find this movie entertaining!"
" terrible
",2018-04-05 00:00:00,2,"Just writing this to warn people : don¬¥t watch it! The acting, the dialogue and the plot is terrible. I¬¥m thinking How on earth did the actors even agree to do this movie? I am happy I watched it on Netflix, because I fast forwarded most of the second part. It was so boring, and it really didn¬¥t have a point! A big pile of mindless tricks just doesn¬¥t do it. I literally can¬¥t believe this movie is rated 6.5 ??!!!"
" Think I've seen this trick before!
",2018-03-28 00:00:00,6,"Has it's fair share of entertainment, but you can't beat the story of the first. With new characters introduced and a new setting, I actually found myself relaxing instead of guessing, as the plot twists and turns, like any magic trick it becomes less enjoyable the second time around, still worthy of a watch for the follow up, but as a stand alone film it doesn't quite hit the spot"
" Not good
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,4,"I liked the first one. It was enjoyable, though it wasn't a great movie, and there's a reason it didn't win an Oscar.
This sequel is just plain bad. It takes everything enjoyable about the first one, and removes them.
For some reason they thought the stuff that didn't work as well as other parts was the stuff people wanted to see, so more of the nonsense was added.
Kind of boring, but not enough so to nap through."
" Now you see me 2 - Rubbish - aghhhhh!!!
",2018-03-22 00:00:00,1,"Don't know what category - Rubbish!The first film was hardly any better so why make a sequel!The plot is a real mess, the film is unwatchable! 
I'm surprised that I stayed until the end!Poke out your eyes with hot pins would be more enjoyable!"
" SPECTACULAR! (ignore the bad reviews, go see for yourself!)
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,9,"Now You See Me 2 - a perfect sequel to one of my favourite films of all time. Looking for something fast-paced, fun, with amazing actors?This movie has it all.About a year and a half after successfully outsmarting the FBI, the remaining of the Four Horsemen (Jesse Eisenberg, Dave Franco and Woody Harrelson) have concealed themselves from the public of New York City accompanied by a new addition to the team: Lula (Lizzy Caplan).However, during a comeback act, the Four Horsemen somehow manage to wind up in Macau, China, where the greater part of the movie takes place; and where I believe the best scene occurs.My favourite scene, which is famously known as the card scene, happens as the Horsemen carry out their cunning plan after having been instructed to steal a computer chip for a criminal named Walter Mabry (acted exceptionally by Daniel Radcliffe).This action-filled scene is guaranteed to make your heart race, as the Horsemen attempt to sneak the chip out of a Science Centre. Practically-done tricks combined with CGI makes for a spectacular scene. The mise-en-scene captures tension with the soundtrack, acting, and camera shots that follow the card as it's being flicked back and forth between them. Wide-eyes and nervous jokes made by the Horsemen are what add character to the scene. Especially when it feels as if you've stepped into their shoes.Suspense rings throughout this entire movie. The many plot-holes build excitement and interest as well as the appearances of well-known acting stars."
" The story continues
",2018-02-26 00:00:00,7,"How to explain it? 
Some people will love it, some will hate it, but overall it is a great sequel to the first one in my perspective, loved every bit of it, it is not over the top for 10/10, but overall it is great to waste some time enjoying the magic show.
Yeah they were some mildly boring scenes but overall the movie is good and it is worth the watch.7/10"
" A trick too far
",2018-02-12 00:00:00,6,"The original 'Now You See Me' film was an incredibly enjoyable affair. It was possibly one of the finest examples of how, if you were willing to suspend your disbelief to epic levels, you really could have a great time watching it. It was Hollywood glitz and popcorn-munching fun all the way through. The - A-list - cast was perfect and played off each other brilliantly, depicting a quartet of modern day Robin Hood-style magicians who stole from the rich and corrupted through the use of their dazzling illusions and, in turn, gave back to the poor. I suppose its success basically guaranteed a sequel would be greenlit. And, where I do give the film credit for doing its best to follow-on closely from the events in the first outing, this time round it's just too unbelievable to be convincing - no matter how hard you try to suspend your disbelief.I really wanted to like this film - and I guess I did. There were plenty of neat moments here and there, it's just I wanted to like it a LOT. And I didn't. The story picks up a little while after the events of the first one and the most noticeable difference for me was the fact that Isla Fisher hasn't returned this time round. She's therefore instantly replaced by another female magician who slots into the team a little too well. Then we get to the meat of the story where the twists and turns start to overtake general common sense and credibility.The rest of the cast return, but the main newcomer is Daniel Radcliffe who entraps the magicians in an attempt to use their collective skills to steal something for him. And, as I mentioned, the 'magic' set-pieces are indeed well-filmed and cool to watch. However, the story just doesn't add up. One of the main complaints from the first one was the 'twist' which left some viewers feeling a little short-changed. Here, the film tries to 'out-twist' the original by taking the story in all sorts of directions which leave you truly confused as to who is on who's side and who is trying to double-cross who.I know that part of the fun with watching magicians perform is trying to guess how the trick is done. With the first film you could just about believe that the feats they carry out could just about be actually real if all the circumstances were just right. In the sequel, everything feels a little cheap as you naturally try to predict how they accomplish these feats, only to find out that the ways they do them are tantamount impossible.Overall, it's an enjoyable enough film, but it does try to be a little too clever for its own good and therefore ends up being too unbelievable to be credible."
" Now I've seen it
",2018-02-10 00:00:00,4,Agree with the critics here. Empty film full of magic tricks. The only fun is to guess how or what. The big crowds cheering make no sense at all.
" Shocked!!!!!!
",2018-01-30 00:00:00,8,"Overall it was a fun and enjoyable movie, but as it was said in the first one:
The Closer you think you are, the farther you'll be."
" Nothing groundbreaking...
",2018-01-27 00:00:00,5,"It can be a fun film if you know what you are getting into, but is lacking in parts. The concept is interesting but sometimes is too far separated from reality. The acting is just okay, nobody gives a fantastic performance. Daniel Radcliffe's character is very strange and his dynamic with Michael Caine is under developed. Furthermore, the comedy is rather misplaced or just has bad timing. The cinematography is bland but the final shot is quite unique! One scene - despite being a little silly - is very fun. As they have to pass a card to each other without being noticed, the film gets creative with the way the magicians pass it to each other. The settings are pretty, and can stand out from just a typical city. Overall, a fun action film but nothing groundbreaking."
" Not bad
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,7,"In all I thought this film was ok. The magic was good and I particularly liked Mark Ruffalo's fight scene.I liked Woody Harrelson playing his twin brother and liked how they built more on thier skills; also trying to teach thier skills to others in the group.
The bit with the computer chip on the playing card seemed rather pointless as they clearly didn't need to move it around as much as they did; and how they moved it around thier bodies just seemed unrealistic.I thought the bit at the end with the horsemen doing small pre-shows in London and explaining the magic to the crowd was a bit weird; we went from one man debunking magic tricks to four people debunking magic tricks?
And to what purpose, to show the crowd how they caught Radcliffe and Caine at the end, which no one really needed to know anyway.
And Morgan Freemans revelation really made no sense; he was on the fathers side but worked against him then he died so he stayed a bad guy? Overly complicated and un-necessary.But I think what really let this film down was giving away the story line before it had even begun; in the first film it wasn't until the end that Mark Ruffalo linked everything together to M√©lanie Laurent on the bridge, but here everything was explained up front and I think that almost killed it.
I just hope NYSM3 will go back to how they worked in the original."
" You are chosen as to what you will become.

They are attempting to keep spying software out of the hands of evil capitalists played by Michael Cain and his illegitimate son Daniel Radcliffe presumably dead. The first part of the film was low entertainment compared to the first feature. We knew how they got to China before it was explained and the pass the card scene, started out cute, got Lizzy out of her bra, put grew old fast and was beneath the writers to use magician slapstick.However, once the scene shifted to London, it was business as usual. A third sequel is in production. While I wanted to see more of Woody Harrelson, creating an idiotic evil twin didn't make it. We get to learn more about the past and ""The Eye."" If you loved the first one, you'll like this one. There is a quick refresher in the beginning, but it was not designed as a recap.Guide: No swearing sex or nudity"
" big names, poor movie
",2017-10-29 00:00:00,4,"Amazingly ''Now You See Me 2'' has proved to be even worse than its already mediocre prequel. This movie just piles impossible and dull acts of ''magic'' on top of each other resulting into no suspense, since you know for a fact the ''Horsemen'' will escape 100% of the time and nothing bad is going to happen to them, because either them or their higher ups have plotted everything out perfectly.I was not a fan of the first movie as it had the same vibe, but this was way worse, i sincerely do not understand why do they have to implement all these crazy plot twists that are not even clever. It appears as if the creators of this just think it is cool to change the way the movie is heading every 5 minutes to give us cheap shock value and wow the audience. It does quite to opposite sadly, since most of the viewers will easily get annoyed with seeing the same stupid cheap tricks and their impossible escapes over and over again. This movie proves that even though you have an incredible cast of actors at your disposal, they can not save you, when the plot is this blatantly dumb.This movie might be very interesting for kids or young teenagers, since it packs the action and cool visual tricks, that kids would definitely enjoy, not the greatest flick for mature audiences though. I hope this is the last past of this franchise, unless they change something drastically. 4/10 for some good acting and decent visuals."
" What happened?
",2017-09-03 00:00:00,4,"The first movie wasn't anything to be proud of but it was at least entertaining. This sequel jumped way too off base from its foundation for a franchise that hasn't gained that kind of leeway yet. Also, Lizzy Caplan is awful. I understand the new thing is to have ugly girls hook up with handsome men as this is Hollywood's low-IQ attempt to get back at all the movies before where ugly men always hooked up with beautiful women. However, at least in those old movies the ugly guy had a redeeming quality that made him appealing. Lizzy Caplan is boring, ugly, forced and useless. Her character does not matter to the story which means she is supposed to be a comic relief but she is more like a foot. Her and that shoe lady from Sex and The City could be twins. They both look like feet. James Franco's brother obviously just read the scene right before he shot it, as he sounds like he is reading from a teleprompter. Jesse Eisenberg is still wondering if he's cool. Woody Harrellson doesn't know where he is. Daniel Radcliffe looks coked out but mad about it and makes a joke that he dabbled with magic in school...cause the filmmakers want to remind you he was Harry Potter as you definitely forgot. Michael Caine is snobby and British, just in case you forgot that this is the only character he plays. Mark Ruffalo is confused. They should make a movie with Ruffalo and Mark Wahlberg and call it The Marks. In the movie they will both just say ""huh?"" and look confused. They shall win golden bodies."
" Better Than the First One
",2017-08-30 00:00:00,7,"(Flash Review)Now You See Me 1 tried to be overly cool, amazing and serious but failed to obtain those goals for me. This new one added a solid comedic angle which helped and was pretty funny at times. That helped it feel fun and allowed me to suspend my disbelief and not to pick apart plot holes too much. The high-level plot is a group a magicians try to reveal the unethical practices of a tech magnate to clear their names from the first movie. Some neat scenes and plenty of CGI magic. Speaking of magic, there aren't many neat illusions and any big magic/illusion is later spoiled during the plot. Woody Harrelson was really good. He had a twin brother (played by himself) that was really cartoony in a good way. Radcliffe played his bad guy role very well I felt; good acting. Anyway, it was moderately entertaining and lightly amusing with some fun visuals."
" didn't mind it
",2017-08-25 00:00:00,7,"A couple of caveats here: I'm not an expert on this type of film, and I didn't pay to see it in a movie theater, both of which color my review.In ""Now You See Me 2"" the Four Horsemen (Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Lizzy Caplan) are back a year after their Vegas act, where they rob a bank in Paris and give the money to the members of the audience. This time Dylan Shrike, still posing as an FBI agent, asks them to expose a company who has a computer card that can get into any computer and manipulate the data.Again, they come up against their nemesis, Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine) whom they robbed a year ago, and his son (Daniel Radcliffe), who want not only the card but to bring down the Horsemen.The whole thing culminates in a huge New Year's Eve show in London.I thought this was fun and entertaining, not to mention outrageous, but that's part of the fun too. I don't take these things too seriously. I enjoyed seeing Michael Caine, Daniel Radcliffe, and Morgan Freeman in their roles as well as the Horsemen.Often in these franchises, the second film isn't as good as the first. This is no exception. Maybe the third will be better."
" The Good, the Bad, the Ugly: Now You See Me 2
",2017-08-25 00:00:00,6,"I wasn't a fan of the first Now You See Me, and I wasn't too impressed with this one. Don't get me wrong here, the acting was decent, and I'll let you know where the movie failed for me. So, let's get into it.Synopsis: One year after outwitting the FBI and winning the public's adulation with their Robin Hood-style magic spectacles, The Four Horsemen resurface for a comeback performance in hopes of exposing the unethical practices of a tech magnate. The man behind their vanishing act is none other than Walter Mabry, a tech prodigy who threatens the Horsemen into pulling off their most impossible heist yet. Their only hope is to perform one last unprecedented stunt to clear their names and reveal the mastermind behind it all. Starring: Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Lizzie Caplan, Mark Ruffalo, Daniel Radcliffe Director: Jon M. ChuThe Ugly: The worst part about this movie is the same as the first movie. It's the story, plain and simple. How could people not put two and two together in the first movie when it came to Ruffalo's character? The same happens here. Here we find out who the leader of the eye is, and what the motivations are, but it is pointless because it nulls the first movie. Such a major let down on story telling here.The Bad: Yes, the acting was good to me, except for one person. Radcliffe is a good actor, but here he seemed lost in the shuffle. Too much was going on throughout the movie. He just couldn't reveal his acting chops.The Good: It's not the acting that made this movie a decent one for me, it was the illusions. From the stories out there, the actors did most of the tricks themselves. Granted, there were a few parts that relied more on CGI than on actual old school tricks, but it was still a fun ride watching them. The tricks are what made this movie.Final Thoughts: Wait for it to come out on TV or something. Don't go out and buy it or Red Box. There is no wait here.Rating: 6 out of 10That's it for me folks.

" Rating: C-
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,4,"I expected a movie similar to the first one: a lot of big flashy moments, fast-paced, well acted and without making any sense sometimes. However, this time, it didn't work out. All of the big moments are easily forgotten in the next scene because they don't do anything for the movie, they're just there. Also, the post- production of this movie is horrible, there are a lot (really, a lot) of editing mistakes throughout the movie, where people are standing in one position in one scene and right in the next cut they're completely different. I usually don't look for this type of error in a film, but when they're too much, it becomes kind of annoying (especially for a 100M$ budget).Mark Ruffalo as Dylan Rhodes carries the entire movie, he is the only one with an actual purpose to be there. All the others are fine, they just don't have anything worth mentioning ... Except for¬†Woody Harrelson. He plays both¬†Merritt McKinney and his twin brother and, not because of the actor himself, but it didn't go well. Actually, it's terrible, I have no idea what they were thinking when they cast him for the twin brother as well because this character is one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen ... And they kept having him in most scenes! He's like an Ewok or Jar Jar Binks (Star Wars) ...Still, the movie has a good start, it gives Mark Ruffalo's character a heartfelt backstory, but then it starts to crumble. While in the first movie, they only had some scenes that didn't make sense, this one it's full of it. All of the magic tricks that they explain, I don't need an explanation for, they are obvious because of the hints they kept giving. Now, explain how Jesse Eisenberg's character disappears by falling and transforming himself into water. I'm not a skeptical guy, I love mystery movies, but this one wants to be realistic ... Using CGI magic.You can watch this movie, it's entertaining and it's mostly fast- paced. Just don't expect that good of a movie.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"

" Big Disappointment
",2017-06-26 00:00:00,3,"I was hoping that the makers of this movie would have learned from the mistakes of the first one. The first movie was almost good but overdid the unrealistic aspects of the so called illusions. This one went even further in the wrong direction. The concept of these movies is a good one and magic and illusions can fascinate the viewer, however this does not do that in any way. The characters are very one dimensional and are totally unconvincing as magicians. There are some good actors in here that could not save what was a poor story with even worse direction. It would have been good if they had a better plot and illusions rather than both being completely silly and not in any way clever or impressive. Maybe they should have watched some Penn and Teller, David Blaine or Dynamo to get some good ideas for dramatic illusions that could actually work. Will I watch the third one? Maybe when the DVD gets reduced to a pound but otherwise no."
" Better than the first.
",2017-06-07 00:00:00,6,"First of all as a Christian i know this is an Illuminati movie as well as the first film and they try to say that they are powerful which is hilarious, i simply see these movies as entertainment and entertainment is non-threatening which is exactly what the Illuminati are.Okay so the first movie is entertaining, but this sequel goes into more detail with the tricks which is clever and much more eye catching. Some of the dialogue is unnecessary (example the dialogue about ""but can God do this"" or whatever he said) there was no need to even go there, but like i said this is an Illuminati film and they try and portray themselves as something special which they are not.Apart from that piece of dialogue, the rest of the dialogue is not that bad, the first movie had ""Merritt"" (Woody Harrelson) saying some creepy things to the woman in the first movie and language like that is excluded here, there's a love-interest chemistry scenario between ""Jack"" (Dave Franco) and the new woman ""Lula"" (Lizzy Caplan) but it's decent compared to the awkwardness of ""Merritt"" and the lady in the first flick.Now You See Me 2 has a style of rhythm poetry which is different and takes some getting used to, the plot is over the top, but overall it's a 90% watchable motion picture.Everyone looks sharp in this cine especially Mark Ruffalo and Jesse Eisenberg who have both clearly got rid of their mop haircuts.The film score composed by Brian Tyler is very very catchy, it sounds extremely similar to the music from the first film but the music in this second one is a bit more funky and isn't always 100% orchestral.The pacing of this movie is okay, the only thing the first film has which is better is the scenery.Looking forward to the upcoming third instalment."

Bad stunts, London acting like a ""blooming"" overexcited American crowd, Daniel (Harry) Radcliffe (Potter) being the bad guy, come on! Even Mark Ruffalo suffering from daddy issues? Boo hoo little boy, he isn't the cool-act magician we were expecting to see. How can this movie be a good second chapter?The single good thing about the movie: Lizzy Caplan, she ROCKED IT"
" Not a bad sequel
",2017-05-23 00:00:00,6,"'Now You See Me 2' is very entertaining but you have to see the first film to understand the characters and plot of this one. I personally think fans of the original should like this one as well as you do get a lot of magic scenes from the movie. The film had a perfect run length and it's just as entertaining. The plot for Now You See Me 2 holds together well. The Four Horsemen -- world-famous magicians who use their ""powers"" to expose greedy criminals -- are in hiding, and the fifth ""Horseman"", revealed in the first film, to be FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo), calls the team back into action for a gig meant to expose a crooked cell-phone tycoon. Only, the gig turns on the Horsemen, and the team finds itself in the middle of a convoluted vengeance plan with deep connections to the first film. Only three of the original Horsemen remain, the pickpocket Jack Wilder (Dave Franco), the surly J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), and the hypnotist Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson) Woody Harrelson, in this movie, gets to play his original character, Merritt McKinney as well as Merritt's fey, quirky and mysterious twin. I have to say, I am not a fan of Woody Harrelson anyway, and didn't like him in the first movie either. Unfortunately original female member Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher) has left the team. In this film she's replaced by a new woman, Lula (Lizzy Caplan), who almost immediately points out the tokenism at work: ""I'm the girl Horseman!"", however she seemed to be there for the sake of having a female in the team and the friendship between the original team and her seemed awkward. One antagonist making life difficult for the Four Horsemen this time out is Walter Mabry, a wealthy entrepreneur who exists ""off the grid"" and coerces the Four Horsemen into stealing a fantastic new computer ""stick"" for him. He also has an important connection with a former target of the Horsemen and as a result the money they stole sort of belonged to him, and he'd like reparations. Mabry's is played with a great dose of devilishness by Daniel Radcliffe. Once again, on the heels of everyone is an exasperated team of FBI agents who, in my opinion, barely registered as a threat. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine also reprise their roles as Thaddeus Bradley and Arthur Tressler respectively. This sequel is clever, well-paced and entertaining. I don't think it is as good as the first film however and there is a seriously preposterous scene *spoiler alert* where the Horsemen try to smuggle a valuable computer chip out of a secret facility. Suddenly suspicious, their escort orders the guards to search them. The slender chip is attached to a playing card, which the Horsemen attempt to conceal through sleight-of-hand tricks amongst themselves. As the pat-down continues, the magicians' moves grow more elaborate. After a few minutes, the card is flying around the room in defiance of all known physical laws‚Äîfrom one Horseman's hand, to the bottom of another's shoe, up through another Horseman's sleeve, down a pant leg, under a collar, into a bra, and so on. Now You See Them 2 has plenty of energy and if you loved the first one you'll like this one, although I don't think, as much."
" Avoid at all costs
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,2,"There's bad movies, there's movies so bad they're good and then there'es that: NYSM2. Bad title, bad actors, no plot, horrible CGI there is nothing to save the movie from total disaster. I haven't ranked a movie so low since ""London has fallen"" but what can you expect from a director whose credits are some Justin Bebeeere stuff, GI Joe nonsense and Step Up soup? Do not buy a ticket, do not rent the movie, just stay away and we might avoid a number 3!"
" It's Not Magic....Just Poor Filmmaking
",2017-05-18 00:00:00,1,The 1st Now You See Me was entertaining but Now You See Me 2 is confusing and poorly done. I can understand why Isla Fisher did not do the sequel as she probably read the script and wisely kept away. Too bad Lizzie Caplan didn't follow suit. This is not a film she wants on her resume. And what the hell is with the stupid idea to have Woody Harrelson play twins?? It appeared as if his twin brother was retarded but I'm sure that is not what the film makers were going for. The poorly developed story is all about flash and effect with no substance. They aimed this directly at those who loved the 1st film and were sure to flock to see what ever crap they put out for a second attempt. I have always had an issue with sequels as the film makers usually don't spend too much on a good script or writer and depend on the success of the first film to put bums in seats. This is most definitely the case here. The director also has very little regard for the audience and must think they are idiots who can't think for themselves as he does ridiculous things and expects us to just let them go. Don't be a sheep and flock to see this crap.
" Gets better
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,8,This was better than the first. I was iffy about the first movie and the few seconds of trailers did not do it justice. I am happy my son said to watch it because it got me curious for the second. I did not like that Radcliff was in it. The actor who played Harry Potter talking about magic... Oh the irony. This movie was great. I hope it gets better and no more Radcliff. Jesse Eisenberg is very good at this.
" The magic is gone in this sequel
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,6,"I was very excited to see Now You See Me 2 because the first film was fantastic and exceeded expectations. Surely they would have enough magic to make a great sequel. However it was not the case, the film was respectable on its own but a poor follow up to the first film. After the triumph of the first film they didn't need to and shouldn't have made another film. The first film ended off perfectly. It would be nice if for once Hollywood wasn't so concerned with making money and cared about the integrity of a film and any legacy it might have. You don't see Christopher Nolan making Inception 2?This film lacked the magic that occurred in the first film. It was predictable which is the worst thing that can occur for a film about magic and mystery. Lizzie Caplan was a terrible addition to the horseman and it just didn't work. Worst thing is the poor plot, you went from a good one in the first to a thin weak one."
" worst movie ever
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,1,"This movie is a complete waste of time. Don't watch it, because you will be disappointed. The story is bad, the characters don't make any sense, and the final annoy you so much. The director should be banned from making other movies. I wanted to die myself throughout the whole of the movie."
" Not enough magic
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,6,"This film definitely should have been titled, ""Now You Don't."" Despite my bitterness toward this, I was looking forward to the return of the Four Horsemen this past May. And while this is not a well- made film, there is still a lot of fun to be had.Led by illusionists Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) and Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), infamous magicians known as the Four Horsemen are back to entertain and thieve using their skills in deception and sleight of hand. Daniel Radcliffe also joins the cast as tech genius Walter Mabry, who forces the Horsemen to steal a chip that will give him control of all of the world's computers.What made ""Now You See Me"" so entertaining was the chemistry between the Four Horsemen and the energy they brought to each of their shows. A nice subplot about a lone detective hunting down the magicians in between their shows also kept the viewers' interest as they awaited the Horsemen's next spectacle.This sequel offers an abundance of plot and new characters, but not enough spectacle. While Rhodes' subplot is somewhat interesting, the resolution of it undermines the impact of the first film's plot twist. The replacement of Isla Fisher's Henley Reeves with Lizzy Caplan's Lula as the female Horseman was also an unwelcome change.However, in the little time they do have in the spotlight, the Horsemen are once again electric. Their charisma and charm give the film just enough magic to overshadow its flawed storytelling and direction."
" A failure, but have a generous 5/10
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,4,"The first movie, basically a supernatural fantasy, had a mix of charm, charisma and glamour. This movie, by comparison, only shared the supernatural factor. The good. I liked Harry Potter's cameo and was rather cheering him on. He was right, we all need to get off the damned grid and get our privacy and therefore freedom back. I felt sorry for him when he got busted. The bad: the entire cast were poor apart from Harry Potter and the English gent with the moustache. Woody Harrelson played twins in this movie, neither of them likable. I assumed that the twin would be behind a neat twin swap trick, or what's the point? Maybe they erased that twist from the script. The twin character was grating, just awful. The other two horsemen guys didn't hold my attention. The new girl tried hard but had a thankless task as she lacked the looks, style and class of the first girl. The original Horsemen were not dismissive of her for nothing: she had no stage presence, no showbiz dazzle. Indeed she seemed to be a kooky escapee from a rom-com (and suddenly, at the end, she had indeed hooked up with one of the Horsemen or whoever.)Her character ended up doing some lame (yet impossible!) pigeon tricks as her contribution to the climax. Yet early in the movie she performed an extraordinary talented magic decapitation trick that, upon a quick rewind, turned out to be literally impossible. And moments later she vanished, which, again, was impossible unless the door was nearby and wide open, which we could rule out by the puzzled look of the (non-gullible) magician's mug. And cartoon-logic impossible feats (blatantly CGI) are par for the course for the entire movie. But even that would be forgivable if it were not for the boring bits with belaboured exposition by Freeman Morgan (contrast that with the effortlessly fun exposition by Harry Potter). Why is Morgan in this movie and, indeed, in half of all Hollywood movies? It's like Hollywood accountants think he gives a movie a marketroid stamp of token street cred or some such, probably because 95% of reviewers feel compelled to say how ""talented"" he is (virtue signalling praise of a non-white actor?) As in, ""Freeman's really talented, but he sucked in this movie, but it wasn't his fault, it was the writer's fault"". The writers screwed up, but so did the director, this movie lacked soul beyond the script's bloated defects. The dreadful twin should have been cut out. The actors seemed detached, they didn't seem to have any heart. The ""girl Horsmen"" gamely tried to liven things up a bit, but the movie was generally dark and slightly depressing."
" In terms of plot, this is a complete mess
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,3,"I didn't care much for NOW YOU SEE ME, a sub-OCEAN'S ELEVEN heist/caper movie with a few magical, sleight-of-hand touches, but it looks great compared to this lacklustre, rushed-out sequel which is set in Macau for some reason. Most of the team from the first film are back with the exception of Isla Fisher, who is replaced by CLOVERFIELD'S Lizzy Caplan, now a flavour of the month in Hollywood.Sadly, the first film's semi-realism is done away with entirely in favour of increasingly ridiculous set-ups and situations here. Woody Harrelson was grating in the first movie but now he's back and playing his own twin as well. He's really irritating and smug to boot. The most interesting casting choice is Michael Caine playing Harry Potter's dad; Daniel Radcliffe is the villain of the piece but completely wishy-washy and unimposing. Mark Ruffalo is the only one who come out of this with his head held high, but even he is ill served by the nonsense of the plotting."
" Harry Potter meets Hustle
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,7,"Without the first film, you won't know what's going on: Dave Franco ""died"", Morgan Freeman went to jail, Michael Cain lost a load of money (all names on the IMDb page) and the other horseman evaded capture. But, having watched the first film, you already know the formula and they stick to it quite well: things start of bad, get worse, brief rally, go badly again, but ultimately the good guys succeed. Yet, compared to the first film, the characters chemistry doesn't seem to flow as well - Lizzy Caplan seems like a teenager compared to Isla Fisher, and two Woody Harrelsons are not as good as one - resulted in my not caring so much about them working as a team. Part of the surprise of the first film was the twist at the end. This time, it didn't feel so surprising. The set pieces are well shot, with all the showmanship elements that the Horse Man seem to require to attract their audience. And while it seemed things were wrapped up at the end of the first film, at times it felt like they've used this sequel to flesh out the original, rather than add a new chapter to the Horse Man, with an expectation that there will be a big reveal in the third film.One annoyance, as a Londoner, is how obvious they make it that much of the action takes place in Greenwich, London, while acting like it's not. The opening scene says tunnel to Manhatten, but it's really a tunnel under the Thames, fine. I get all films use locations and make them up how they wish, but if you're going to use obvious landmarks - like the Cutty Sark or Greenwich Market (as opposed to the aerial shots of Covent Garden they use) - having a character ask ""where's your entry? South Bank? Greenwich? Greenwich..."", while they're obviously stood in the world famous Greenwich University, seems like a redundant line to me. Likewise the bad guys using a map on the other side of the river? Given what their main target is, this just seems sloppy.If you liked the first film, then you'll see this one to progress the story line. But like any magician, they need to do bigger and better on their next trick, and this doesn't feel like they did."
" Really let me down
",2017-03-23 00:00:00,1,"The first was so much fun and so good. This one...what happened? This was just bad. I hope you don't waste your time hoping for a fun time this is just a bad movie. Not sure how it went so far off track but I did not like it and felt bad while I was watching it. It seemed like a bad imitation of a movie. There are some great actors in this movie so how did it end up this bad? Even the great actors seemed to be really fake when they acted, it was not believable. I was not interested for a majority of the movie and it seemed to take forever to go anywhere, when it did make a point it was a let down. Overall this just didn't work. I really enjoyed the first movie, this one left me frustrated."
" A very short review of ""Now You See Me 2"" (2016)
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,7,"My enthusiasm for ""Now You See Me's"" hero magicians waned just a bit after seeing last year's sequel. It was fun enough, though, so I'd give it a 7 out of 10.Much of my enjoyment was hampered here by the use of an overly convenient plot device that was also utterly ridiculous ‚Äî one of the ""Four Horsemen"" protagonists can simply employ hypnosis to persuade anybody to do anything. It seems like a godlike power, and it feels like a pretty big cheat on the part of the screenwriter. (I think anyone familiar with hypnosis knows it absolutely doesn't work as depicted here, anyway.)If even one of the protagonists has this ability, why do they need to employ legerdemain to commit or stop crimes in the first place? Instead of disguises or sleight-of-hand, couldn't they just program unwilling confederates to do everything for them, at minimal risk to themselves? And why steal anything in a conventional sense, if they can just brainwash a target into ""giving"" it to them?Like the first film, though, ""Now You See Me 2"" is entertaining, if you take it as an escapist fantasy. It's still a pretty creative premise, and it's still nice and funny. (The exception is a bunch of jokes connected with a twin brother for Woody Harrelson's character. The character, also played by Harrelson, was annoying and creepy enough to make me cringe.)One nice addition to this film was Lizzy Caplan as the new female ""horseman"" after the departure of actress Isla Fisher. Caplan is charismatic and fun to watch, and she has good comic timing.I'd recommend seeing this, if you enjoyed the first movie."
" Demands too much of the viewer while offering little in return
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,3,"I watched the first installment of Now You See Me expecting it to be fun and clever, which it was. A fast-paced romp, it touched on classic themes of both heist movies and magic movies, while remaining original in its twists and turns.Now You See Me 2 borrows from similar themes, but demands an impossible level of suspension of disbelief from the viewer. I'm not usually one for eye-rolling, but I found plenty of opportunities in these two hours.As in the first installment, we are again asked to believe in a theatrical take on hypnosis that is unironically comical in its brevity and delivery. We are further expected to believe that there are numerous masters of this art, all of whom can be instantly captivated by one another on a whim. While I cracked a smile the first time, it's clearly nothing more than a convenient way for the writers to fill obvious plot holes.Laws of physics do not exist in this film, beginning with the horsemen's impossible card- bouncing shenanigans. Later, in a more glaringly obvious gaffe, one questions the water- drop strobe effect that a filmmaker apparently saw in their high school physics class without listening to the teacher's explanation. While enough strobes would indeed have appeared to ""freeze"" the raindrops, they would have continued to drench both performer and onlooker relentlessly.Then there are the moments left unexplained, from the belt taken without a master thief noticing, to the ludicrous moment of Jesse Isenberg dissolved into a puddle (good lord that somehow seems even more ridiculous as I type it), to just how exactly none of the numerous security guards noticed a damn playing card being thrown around a clean room. And when in the world did they find the time to set up all the gear for their final acts?While the film had some bright spots (Ruffalo's fight/escape scene comes to mind), not even the performances of good actors could save this movie from the impossible tasks the writers asked of them. I really wanted to like this...it just wasn't in the cards."
" Unrealistic & Lacking in details (Compared to the first sequel)
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,6,"When I first found out that a sequel for the first ""Now You See Me"" was coming out, I was very excited because I was fascinated by the first movie. It was a unique movie about something mystical and clever- magic! However, I was quite disappointed by the second movie. While the first movie had a fine story line and some intelligent scenes that caught the eyes of the audience, the second movie seemed to focus mostly, and almost only on the visual effects. It was very entertaining to watch the magical scenes, but it was way too unrealistic and lacked in depth of explaining the actual tactic of the magic performed. The first movie did a much better job planning the acts they performed all around the country, making the magic more interesting and still thrilling. There was just one scene in the second movie that seemed clever to me- the scene when the team passed around the card with the chip around the room without being noticed by the guards. Although such scenes may seem unnecessary in the actual plot, I think they are the highlights of these kinds of movies and the reason why most people watch these kinds of movies."
" You had me stop watching at Eisenberg
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,3,"So yeah, I saw the first film and meh. I was looking at Daniel Radcliffe's IMDb page for another review and I saw he was in this so I put it on my watch-list. But funny story, about ten or twelve minutes into the film Jesse Eisenberg appears on screen and I literally stopped watching the film and deleted it from my DVR. The strange thing is that it was more of a reflex than a decision. I can not watch another second of Eisenberg in anything. If Chris Nolan was to make a movie starring Jesse Eisenberg I wouldn't watch it.. and I watch EVERY Nolan film.. in theaters.. sometimes multiple times. But from what I did watch of this film and the fact that the first film is completely overrated, I'm not missing out on anything."
" See me or no see me?
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,9,"This sets place after the events of the first movie, which a sleeper hit. A success no one expected, but the sequels I guess in such cases are to be expected (yes Part 3 is a go for 2019). So while I was more than cautious with my expectations considering this movie, I was more than entertained by the end result I had the pleasure to watch.Don't get me wrong, this is not perfect and does have a couple of hurdles. But as with most magicians they do a great trick in diverting your attention. And of course there is one set piece which seems completely redundant in light of a twist that reveals it needn't be that complicated. But if you start questioning the fun factor, then you won't be able to enjoy this anyway. Yes this is supposed to be fun and light and it is both of those things. Sit back, relax and take this in as it is meant to be ..."
" Just plain silly
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,3,"Daniel Radcliffe is in this movie, so that's pretty cool... aside from that, everything else is a downgrade from the first movie. The characters are less interesting, the dialogue isn't clever or funny, Woody Harrelson's second role is annoying and the most important aspect of any film about magicians or ""magic"", the explanation of their performance a.k.a. the twist, is lazy and makes no sense. I liked the first movie of the franchise. I didn't think it was fantastic, but definitely entertaining. The second movie made me furious at times because they seemed to think that trying to outdo every twist of the first movie would guarantee the second movie to be good. It didn't. They bombard you with these twists that don't make sense, leaving you thinking ""so at this point anything is possible because anything can be a twist"". You get a sensation of not fearing for the main characters because everything happening on the screen will be negated at some point of the movie. You expect every bad twist, you only wonder what illogical explanation they're going to offer this time."
" Original Riveting. Sequel Ridiculous
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,2,"The original ""Now You See Me"" was riveting; the sequel is ridiculous. The original did a perfect job of blurring the line between magic as an illusion and magic as supernatural. ""2"" in a futile attempt to top the original, crosses the line into puerile preposterousness. ""2"" was in fact so inane that I can't even summon the enthusiasm to write a review panning it. I wasted over two hours watching this...I'm not wasting any more time writing about it."
" Meh
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,6,"Similar to the first installment, this one was full of techno-glitz and short on compelling drama. Characters are shallow and the plot is too contrived and difficult to follow. I don't want to work hard to follow what's going on, nor do I want to have things conveniently semi-explained after a series of illogical scenes with numerous holes and gaffes.The premise of this movie holds a lot of promise. The execution failed to live up to that promise.About my reviews: I do not offer a synopsis of the film -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of ""terrible"", with 5 being ""mediocre"" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good.

" No magic to be found here
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,3,"I really wanted to like 2013's Now You See Me. I love a good fun movie and I love being bluffed by clever magic, hence why I enjoy The Prestige to this day, but Louis Leterrier's financially successful and well-liked film was a dumb, daft and overblown experience that was neither as smart, sassy or suave as it thought it was, and I found myself thoroughly disappointed with the box office hit.Fast forward to 2016 and Australia's Isla Fisher has jumped the magic ship along with Leterrier, who has passed the directional baton to Jem and the Holograms and Step Up 3D mastermind Jon M. Chu, who has enlisted the comedic workings of Lizzy Caplin to fill in for Fisher and added a double dosing of Woody Harrelson and the world's most famous wizard Daniel Radcliffe to help enliven proceedings with this unwanted sequel, but while there's just as many flashing lights, colourful characters and ADHD storytelling as the first film, Now You See Me 2 is not surprisingly an even poorer attempt at movie magic than its throwaway forefather.To talk much about Now You See Me 2's plot would be giving too much credit to an event that pays near on zero attention to detail in trying to even make a miniscule attempt at making logical sense, and while it's fine for a film to look to entertain rather than adhere to logical rules of our existence in this universe, Chu's film doesn't even entertain throughout its overdrawn runtime.From incredible feats of card manoeuvring, manipulation of the weather or conference interrupting shenanigans, Now You See Me 2 certainly tries to be cool and its able cast that all look incredibly bored with their lot in sequellife (#showmethemoney) are pretty ""hip"", this experience feels tired and devoid of life, not something you want when what you've signed up for is supposedly a magical joy ride that will shock us with its reveals and make us gasp at its twists.The addition of Radcliffe adds a sprinkling of life to this rather dead-on-arrival and much too self-confident follow up, but this series that started out sounding promising, only to deliver a forgettable first entry and now this even more lacklustre sequel, is a one that needs to be laid to rest in the magicians coffin quickly, which sadly will be put on hold as the unappealing third entry to the franchise is brought to life over the coming years.1 ¬Ω bouncing playing cards out of 5"
" What a mess
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,2,"First of all I'm surprised that there's a sequel to 'Now You See Me' in the first place. The first film was a classy new take on the heist movie, but I certainly didn't think it needed a sequel.But Hollywood obviously dictated that it did,so nearly all of the original cast reunite for this rather silly follow-up that isn't nearly as good.It all starts well, but soon we're on a pointless jaunt around the world, with some poor dialogue and ridiculous plot points along the way. The minute Woody Harrelson ends up playing his twin I knew the game was up and that this sequel would join a long line of 'weaker than original' cash ins. It's a shame really, because this has a talented cast, who seemed game to make this a hit.The absence of Isla Fisher divides fans, some missed her, some didn't. I thought that while Lizzy Caplan brought something different to the role of female horseman, it didn't really work.A real mess of a film."

" Now you see me 2
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,7,"Now you see me 2 is a movie where the start line keeps you guessing just what is really happening. It makes you pay great attention to detail and everything in the movie so you can try to figure out what is going on because the director, Jon Chu did a great job of hiding the secrets that help the horsemen complete their stub its and keep them from falling apart. It is a movie of many quick cuts, pans and zooms to try to hint at how tge horsemen are completing their stunning tricks and to keep your eye away form them sometimes so that for most viewers the story doesn't come together until the end, so they will stay on the edge of their seats. It does a great job of making you feel as though the villains have the upper hand and are going to win and flipping everything around to show that the heros have been in control the whole time even if they may not have known it."
" Deus ex machina
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,2,"Almost every single incident that occurs throughout this entire movie, every line, every bump, every movement, is a coincidental plot device used to assist one of the main characters in escaping some sort of predicament or overcoming some obstacle which they may encounter. This occurs so often and (might I add) with the subtlety of a giant neon sign with flickering lights displaying the words- ""PLEASE NOTICE THIS ITS IMPORTANT BUT WE WONT TELL YOU WHY""-It's almost insulting to the viewers intelligence. This is a movie about the subtle art of slight of hand and illusion its supposed to be mysterious, at least attempt to be subtle in your ""coincidental plot devices"" I know this is a fictional story and in such cases we can be liberal with reality, fine i accept that; however if you are going to give not one but three of the characters the ability to instantly hypnotize people, making them do basically whatever the hell you damn well please, the rest of the show, the fancy lights the trickery all that just seems pointless. Oh but there is a catch people can only be hypnotized when they are off guard. Fine wait for mr baddie to be off guard do your vodoo magic on his mind and make him give his money back to the poor or whatever it is you require. What are the rest of the horsemen needed for. I can go on and on and on and on but you get the point. Don't try to be a ""who dunnit"" type mystery when you can make anyone do what you want when you want that's goes be on lazy writing."

Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep are the first names that spring to mind.Woody Harrelson has just got one of those faces, and acting methods, that makes me want to punch him, the screen and the casting director. I'm afraid this started as early as Cheers. And in this film we get him twice playing twins.Did anyone else want Michael Caine to kill the horseman pretty early on?"
" Usual underwhelming sequel
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,3,"Now You See Me was a big hit of 2013, not brilliant, but more than adequate. The powers that be in Hollywood then decide to make a sequel which feels like a remake but far less adequate. The main cast was the same as the original, except Isla Fisher, who was replaced by Lizzy Caplan, the script was probably written over a lunch meeting, and the sets were bright and noisy, probably to avoid how little acting was going on. I remember Michael Caine when collecting one of his many awards years ago, saying that he had starred in over 100 terrible movies simply for the money, obviously he is still doing it. Avoid, unless completely bored."
