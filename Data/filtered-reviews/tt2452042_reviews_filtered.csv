" This is a snooze fest!
",2021-04-01 00:00:00,2,"It is really boring,They took the plot from A Goofy Movie,Why is Blue Sky making ripoffs of so many disney renessaince films? I am gonna watch ratatouille to get this overrated disaster out of my mouth."
" Charlie Brown between Mickey Mouse and Homer Simpson
",2021-03-31 00:00:00,8,"This is a mock ""romance"" about Charlie Brown's efforts to gather enough confidence to talk to the ""Red-Headed Girl,"" the new kid in town and in his class, whom he admires, mostly from afar. It's a step up from the Valentine's day special, where we never actually see her, but a name would have been nice. Charlie Brown occupies a space between Mickey Mouse and Homer Simpson in the American cultural pantheon of ""normal"" male characters: ultimately good-natured, like Mickey, but without the success or circle of adoring associates; and incompetent, like Homer, but without his numerous vices. The movie emphasizes Charlie Brown's good side, which I appreciated, and, although his classmates still often make fun of him, they too appreciate him. His virtue lies not in his good looks (already bald? How old are these kids anyway?) nor his innate abilities (he does not actually have the highest score on the test, which he duly admits to the whole school while receiving his award upon recognizing that he signed the wrong paper). Instead, he is caring for others, even to his own detriment, for example in subjecting himself to intense shame during the talent show to save his little sister from the same fate. In this sense, he's a rare (and timeless) model. My kids enjoyed the movie more than the specials. I'm not sure I agree, but we all thought that the adaptation to computer graphics was flashy yet still managed to stay faithful to the more rough-hewn hand drawn animation of the earlier comicstrips and specials."
" I am shocked at this movie.
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,3,"This is a full length ripoff of A Goofy Movie! Roxanne playing as The Little Red Haired Girl,What the hell is this? Snoopy going on a road trip with The Red Baron. I give this 3/10."
" A gentle, reassuring, yet thrills-free cute little movie!
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,10,"The kind of feel-good movie for an audience which is in dire need of steady pace and sweetness! The most exciting stuff happening are related to Snoopy's imaginary romance set in a WW1 dream world. But the lack of thrills is not disappointing at all, since the movie showers the audience with positive messages.Charlie Brown fails time and time again, yet he never gives up despite his insecurities. Extremely shy most of the times, especially with respect to his Little Red-Haired Girl crush, he does not lack bravery and strength when set to do the right and honourable things. He is gentle, yet energetic, not a born - genius, yet he's thriving thanks to his persuasion. He sets the right example for kids and adults alike. His crush matches his personality by motivating her decisions for all the right reasons.All in all, a charming, light-hearted comedy about self-growth, camaraderie, friendship and innocence."
" The greatest Peanuts movie!!
",2021-02-08 00:00:00,10,"The first computer-animated Peanuts movie is so damn funny, and full of kissing, throwing, and dancing!!!"
" Have a metaphor about repetitive adaptations
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,7,"A sweet and passionate film, both in the plot and in the visual. I almost cried several times, but maybe it's because of the nostalgia, lol. I also liked the metaphor about repetitive adaptations, always importing what the work teaches or remembers for the character of the human being."
" Excellent animation ... but too damn boring
",2020-11-21 00:00:00,3,"I was so excited to watch it, but after 15min it gets so boring. Too bad..."
" ADORABLE CHARACTERS!
",2020-11-05 00:00:00,10,"A Tribute to Charles M. Schulz
I really enjoy The Peanuts Movie. It reminds me of the classic Charlie Brown movies, but even better! Even though the Peanuts creator, Charles M. Schulz passed away in 2000, this movie is a tribute to his memory and the legacy that he left behind.While the members of the Peanuts Gang look and act like their lovable selves, there are many updates to this film. The animation is much more detailed than the previous movies and viewers are able to watch it in 3D. There are many new upbeat songs in addition to the much loved tunes. ""Better When I'm Dancin'"" by Meghan Trainor is a great addition to the original songs.The Peanuts Movie is about Charlie Brown trying to break his losing streak so the little Red Haired Girl (voiced by Disney's Francesca Capaldi) will view him differently than his friends do. He tries to change his luck in a dance contest, a talent show, flying a kite and writing a book report. Also, Snoopy tries to defeat the Red Baron in order to win the love of his life Fi Fi, voiced by Kristen Chenoweth.My favorite character is Snoopy because he is very funny. His story is well written and filled with love, comedy and adventure. Some of the funniest characters are Lucy, Sally, Snoopy and Woodstock. They got great laughs from the audience including kids as young as three. All the voice talent perfectly suits their characters. Fans of Linus, Schroeder, Pig Pen, Peppermint Patty and all the others will not be disappointed.The moral to this film is, ""if you see yourself as a winner or a loser in life, you are probably going to act like one. If you think you are a winner, act like one and others might think so too.""I rate The Peanuts Movie 5 out of 5 stars because of the colorful animation and it being true to the original Peanuts Gang. I recommend this movie for ages 3 to 15 or any people who have enjoyed the other Peanuts movies. At the end of this film there is a 3 second clip. The credits are very long so be sure to stick around until the end."
" Simply fantastic
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,9,"This film did a fantastic job of capturing the charm and style of Charles Shulz. He would be so proud of all the detail that was paid toward making his 2d drawings come to life in 3d without losing all the charm that made the original comics so beloved. Not only that, but the story itself is vintage Shulz. Gotta love a film that pays so much respect to its source material. Kudos to the creative team that put this all together!"
" Marvelous work
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,8,"Wonderful and uplifting animation movie. Charles Schultz created a masterpiece and this work, co-produced years after his death, by his son and grandson, is one of the few original releases after his passing.The movie uses a well balanced level of 3D animation, that produces an advanced look, while preserving the feel of the original animation specials. The plot is as much a compilation of previous Peanuts specials as it is a truly original work, but the situations are woven together with care and continuity.The effort is innocence and goodness incarnate, and this makes it a very welcome change of pace from other productions that somehow feel themselves compelled to delve into some somber situation. Instead, this movie devotes to its audience a full 90 minutes of good laughs, warmhearted moments, and sincere moral lessons.Children will simply have an enjoyable time watching the movie, while adults will happily stroll down memory lane. There is little doubt that for the son and grandson, that was the goal of this movie, both as a valentine to Charles Schultz, but also a nice and modern take on the famed classic."
" Ahhhh Memories!!
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,10,This takes me back to my childhood and the many charlie brown holiday specials. Love these characters and this movie was amazing. Definitely worth a watch!!Tim Treakle
" Utterly Charming!
",2020-08-19 00:00:00,9,"I grew up on Peanuts. Never missed the comic strip on Sundays, watched every special on t.v with my cuddly toy. Snoopy at my side. So, having the pleasure of viewing this feature length film of Charlie Brown and and the rest of the Peanuts gang, I can firmly state I was thoroughly charmed! I found myself smiling throughout. Well done for bringing back an old face. Charles M. Shultz would be pleased!"
" Delightful for people of all ages
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,10,"It may be my personal bias, but I can't think of another film that speaks to me better on a personal level. Charlie Brown as a character isn't just a blank slate for kids to imagine themselves as, he's shy, a screw-up, a daydreamer, nervous, but in the end, bravely does what needs to be done. Even if you don't relate to this, you'll be delighted from beginning to end."
" The heartwarming of the Peanuts gang
",2020-08-11 00:00:00,10,"This movie brings back the nostalgia of Charlie Brown. Sunday comics were always a bright part of my week. The Peanuts were always front and center. My dad would had them to me as I flipped through and used Silly Putty to stretch the faces of my favorite characters. Now with a son of my own and a digital age, this is just a memory.The characters are great, the small stories withing the overall story is great. Classics like Snoopy and the Red Barron, Lucy and Linus, Schroeder, and of course Charlie Brown and the Little Readheaded Girl. This movie has the laughs, even if you are 3 or 73 years old.The main theme in this movie is great for kids and adults: Be yourself, people will see you for who you are, even if you don't.The movie teared me up as I identified with Charlie Brown most of my life. My father even calling me that even now. Loved every minute.-The Denton Traveler"
" That Was Adorable!
",2020-08-11 00:00:00,8,"This movie, from start to finish, was a tribute and love letter to both Charles Schulz and the decades of kids (and kids-at-heart) who cherished and grew up with Charlie Brown over the years.
This movie is funny, which is a nice change. The movie has genuine humour that fits the characters that deliver the lines, generating a laugh out of me, a grown adult.
The casting was fantastic, coming as close to the original voices as they may ever get. Leading the cast is, of course, Noah Schnapp (who would later go on to much-deserved acclaim as Will Byers in the Netflix series Stranger Things) as Charlie Brown. They're big shoes to fill; the entire movie was riding on his shoulders, but he hit the mark every time he was needed to.The plot of this film is lifted right from the original cartoons: the Little Red-Haired Girl moved in next door and poor Charlie Brown, smitten with love and living with every single force in the universe working against him, has to overcome his insecurities and approach her. We also get a subplot with Snoopy and the Red Baron. They really didn't get lazy when it came to effectively using nostalgia, with classic plot points and recreations of classic moments.It's not perfect, however, and it's in those recreations that things start to drag down a little bit. While some of them are well done and provide a cute little nostalgic moment for the viewer, some of them are forced, poorly delivered and downright cringy. It's not the fault of any of the actors, but the throwbacks should've been used a little more sparingly.That being said, there are some genuinely nice throwbacks hidden among the lesser ones.This is definitely a must-see for any fan of Charles Schulz or the Peanuts gang in general."
" Delightful
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,8,"I liked this movie a lot! It's funny, bright, charming, and super wholesome."
" The Old and the New
",2020-07-30 00:00:00,8,"The Peanuts movie is such a great movie mainly because it perfectly captures the aesthetic of Charles Schultz's legendary cartoon strip. Everything, from the humor, to the simple, clean animation, to the voice acting, is amazing. In its transition to 3D, peanuts has managed to hold onto all of its old-school aesthetics."
" Sweet
",2020-06-04 00:00:00,7,"The animation of this film stood out, as it 3D but also true to the style of the original comics and cartoon. I think this is the best screen adaptations of Peanuts because it gets the pacing and story length right, rather than taking a small comic strip story and stretching it out to feature length. The characters and gags were all well done and memorable as always."
" The Peanuts Movie (2015)
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,6,"Directed by Steve Martino. Starring (voices) Noah Schnapp, Hadley Belle Miller, Alex Garfin, Mariel Sheets, Venus Omega Schultheis, Noah Johnston, Rebecca Bloom, Micah Revelli. (G)First movie based on Charles M. Schultz comic strip in over three decades; focus is placed on Charlie Brown (Schnapp) and his hopeless crush on the new girl in class (""the Little Red-Haired Girl""), with the occasional interlude set in Snoopy's fantasy world where he engages in dogfights with the Red Baron. Animation, rendered in a bright form of flattened three-dimensional art, has lots of elegant style, but is a bit too crisp and polished compared to the original comics, negating the scratchy minimalism and melancholy that is such an important part of its identity. Contains numerous charming moments and nostalgic references, but also deals out brief, frantic bursts of action, which is also hardly in the same spirit as the source material; a soundtrack that includes songs from Meghan Trainor and Flo Rida certainly doesn't help matters either. A mixed bag, but gently appealing, and more forgiving or casual fans should have a good enough time. Snoopy and Woodstock's voice are provided by archival recordings of Bill Melendez.63/100"
" Wonderful Movie
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,10,"This is one of my very favorite animated films because of it's pure goodness. It has some silly, some fun, and some good old wonderful moral points that I loved recognizing in my own life. Good for any day and any age."
" On par with Pixar
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,10,"We have a contender for Best Animated Film, everyone! It won't win, because it's not Pixar, but if it was it would definitely win. Unlike some movie adaptations that have come out this year that completely disregarded the source material (Looking at you, Fantastic Four!) this feels very true to the Peanuts and what they're all about. The animation is at times even better than some Pixar films. It's all CGI, but the characters look hand drawn, while at the same time having depth. It's a very unique looking film, and has definitely set a new standard for computer animation. While the film doesn't really have a plot, and tends to quickly jump from one scene to the next, I thought that overall the movie was very cute and is definitely one of the best films of 2015!
Grade: A+ 10/10 5/5 stars"
" nice
",2020-03-09 00:00:00,6,"Properly stylized and true to its origens. in the end its still a little simple even for a kids movie, but its fine overall. not much else to say really.6/10: a good take"
" What?! This faithful masterpiece bombed?
",2019-12-23 00:00:00,10,"Like my classifiaction says go back what was that I really mean that Peanuts Movie was diffrent from other movies theaters had in the 2010 decade had. I liked to watch it It was a good movie in my mind. It should've never flopped in theaters. This film so fast when they had other shows that were worst then this it was show on theaters about 2010-2015 but the box office didn't meet it's standard for their their hidden gems. if you want to call Megamind, Free Birds or Igor great, those movies are dumb. Box Office has really lost their minds to put on shows like that but anyway I give this my Seal of Awesome."
" This movie was adorable.
",2019-11-09 00:00:00,9,"I was unsure at first because of the animation style, it was much more modern than the charming animation style of the 60s and 70s specials. However, despite the 3D CGI animation style, the original charm of the cartoon specials remained intact. I liked how the animation didn't seem as finished just like the original Peanuts specials. In the film, just like in the specials, the trees and other plants in the background remained static. Even when it was supposedly windy. This film, like many of the Peanuts specials, had two storylines: A Charlie Brown storyline and a Snoopy storyline. In the Charlie Brown storyline, the film deals with Charlie trying to work up enough nerve to talk to the Little Red Haired Girl. In the Snoopy story, Snoopy finds an old typewriter and works on writing a novel. His novel deals with the World War I flying ace trying to save his crush Fifi from the clutches of the evil Red Baron.This movie featured many in-jokes from the specials and comic strips. The typical Peanuts sentimentality was also present as were the lack of adults. The wonderful Peanuts music was present throughout the film. I wish they wouldn't have included a modern song, but it doesn't detract too much from the film. There were also bits of the comic strip that popped up throughout the film and also the fun 60s style graphics that would also appear periodically. It was such a fun film, I will definitely be purchasing my own copy.I read that this film was written in complete cooperation with Charles M. Schulz's widow and the other members of his family. Schulz' son and grandson wrote the screenplay and apparently the Schulz family had to have approval over all aspects of the film. They also used archive sound recordings of Bill Melendez' Snoopy sounds for Snoopy's ""voice"" in the film. I did think that the Peppermint Patty voice was slightly off. The other Patty (who normally has brown hair and wears an orange dress) in this film was blonde and wore a green dress. Neither of the Pattys inaccuracies affected my enjoyment of this film."
" This fan of the vintage comics approves
",2019-10-20 00:00:00,8,"A surprisingly charming retread of familiar characters that has elements of the show and also the original comics.Its fragmented plot never spends too long on any particular idea and gains drive from the central point of impressing the Little Red Head girl but along the way becomes a warming depiction of friendship and all life's little struggles and disappointments.it's 2.5D approach to the animation is chic, modern but is still true to the iconic look.Laughs and delights a plenty."
" Snoopy and Charlie Brown: The Peanuts Movie
",2019-08-03 00:00:00,6,"I may have watched the classic Snoopy or Charlie Brown cartoons a couple of times when I was a kid. It's a bit of a Marmite thing for me, I know peopke like it, but Charlie Brown is a depressing loser kid, at least Snoopy is likeable lol. I'd heard of the 60s short movie, A Charlie Brown Christmas, but this is the first full length feature film I'd seen featuring the characters from the Peanuts comic strip, also the first made in 35 years. Basically, Charlie Brown (Noah Schnapp) is the accident-prone child, with a long-running streak of failures. A Little Red-Haired Girl moves into the neighbourhood, Charlie Brown is infatuated with her, but worries his clumsiness will prevent her from noticing him. Lucy van Pelt (Hadley Belle Miller) says he should be more confident, so Charlie Brown decides to try a few activities, to find one that may get the new girl's attention. His first attempt is to participate in the school's talent show with a magic act, with help from his dog Snoopy (Bill Melendez, one of Peanuts' original animators), and his best friend, yellow bird Woodstock. But something goes wrong during the act of Charlie Brown's sister Sally (Mariel Sheets), he helps her out, humiliating himself in the process. Next he wants to impress the Little Red-Haired Girl, Charlie Brown signs up for the school dance and Snoopy teaches him some moves. At the dance, Charlie Brown gains positive attention for his skills, but slips and sets off the sprinkler system, the dance is cut short and all the other students look down on him again. Charlie Brown is partnered with the Little Red-Haired Girl to write a book report. He is initially excited to have the chance to be with her, but she is called away by a family illness, leaving Charlie Brown to write the report by himself. Charlie Brown decides to write a report on the intellectual novel War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy. At the same time, following a standardized test, Charlie Brown finds he is the only student to get a perfect score. His friends and the other students congratulate him, and his popularity begins to climb. However, at an assembly to accept an award, he finds out that the test papers were mixed up, the high score belongs to Peppermint Patty (Anastasia Bredikhina). Charlie Brown declines the medal, losing all his new-found popularity. Then his book report is destroyed, and he admits to the Little Red-Haired Girl he has caused them to both fail the assignment. Before leaving school for the summer, Charlie Brown is surprised when the Little Red-Haired Girl chooses him for a pen pal. Linus (Alexander Garfin), Lucy's brother, convinces Charlie Brown he needs to tell the Little Red-Haired Girl how he feels about her before she leaves for the summer. He races to her house but sees that she is about to board a bus for summer camp, he thinks it is already too late. He takes a kite out of the Kite-Eating Tree, the string becomes tangled around him, and the breeze drags him in the direction of the bus. Charlie Brown's friends are amazed to see him flying a kite, something he has always failed to do, they follow him. When he reaches the bus, Charlie Brown asks the Little Red-Haired Girl (Francesca Capaldi) why shy chose him despite his various failures. She tells him that she admires his selflessness, determination and honesty, and the two promise to write to each other. In a subplot, Snoopy finds a typewriter and writes a story about the First World War Flying Ace, trying to save his love interest Fifi (Kristin Chenoweth) from the Red Baron. Snoopy uses the events and situations surrounding Charlie Brown as his inspiration to develop his story, coming across him and the gang many times along the way. Also starring Noah Johnston as Schroeder, A.J. Tecce as Pig-Pen, Rebecca Bloom as Marcie, and Marleik as Franklin. Charlie Brown is fairly likeable being the very unlucky but ambitious boy, Lucy is amusingly snappy, and the other supporting children are fun, obviously it is Snoopy the beagle that almost steals the show with his adventures involving his doghouse. The film does have three-dimensional characters and locations, but the style of animation sticks very closely to the original comic strips, from the character expressions to their cartoonish actions, it should make you laugh, and works well for both fans of Peanuts, and the new generation, a fun family computer-animated comedy. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Animated. Good!"
" In spite of my age, I cried alone in a theater.
",2019-07-06 00:00:00,5,"I was a little sad because most people except for me were family!The image of Snoopy's CG was very good. I heard that it was hard to keep his face in any views. So some cg models were prepared. Probably, his nose moves sometimes.
I thought characterizing famous characters seemed to be difficult. They can't be recognized as 3d characters of them without depicting faithfully. They're not satisfied just that it's starting to take shape."
" My kids love this movie
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,9,The tag line says it all. My kids absolutely love this movie. It was nice seeing modern animation with the original characters. I even found myself laughing at this film.
" Great movie.
",2019-05-01 00:00:00,8,Just like I said about epic this is a good movie with a good animation style which is based on a comic strip
" A classic in the making
",2019-04-28 00:00:00,10,"Any fan, new or old, of the Peanuts gang will love this movie. Who can't relate to Charlie Brown and Snoopy? The movie focuses mostly on Charlie Brown as he fumbles through his ""born loser"" status and does his best to impress the Little Red Haired Girl when she moves in. Snoopy also has a similar storyline. This is well worth watching to catch Lucy, Linus, Schroeder, and all year favorite characters!*** out of ****"
" Snoopy is back
",2019-01-21 00:00:00,5,"Charlie Brown wants to impress the little Red Haired Girl who has moved into his street. However everything he does to impress her causes further commotion. He hopes to dance with her but trips and sets off the sprinklers at the school hall.Meanwhile Snoopy has fantasies that he is on a biplane battling the Red Baron up in the skies.Charlie learns a lesson that he should be himself. In his case being neurotic and getting things wrong.The Peanuts Movie adds 3D animation but also tries to retain its charm and some nostalgia with its animation style.However it is too long, too padded and falls flat.I was not sure even who it was even aimed at. Young kids may not know Snoopy and older folks would find the film to be old hat."
" Entertaining 3-D Comic Animation
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,8,"8 November 2015. When a full feature film version of a classic comic strip retains its old fashioned, traditional charm like contemporary Rockwell Painting reprints, its pretty hard to complain. Except for a somewhat slow paced patch in the first third of Charlie Brown, this sharp, crisp outline cartoon figures merges well with 3-D technology and includes familiar voices of characters many in the audience grew up with. Finally, Charlie Brown gets to experience the full range of emotions and literally ups and downs. Interestingly, the movie ends on a promise for a new evolution of the Charlie Brown series. Adults get to fall in love again with simple time of childhood dreams and childish paranoia and fantasy playfulness while a new generation of children get to experience a truly violence free but meaningful story lines that often get lost in the truly simpleton, action-oriented animated movies of today."
" Surprisingly not bad
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,6,"The Peanuts Movie is surprisingly not bad. It has a unique animation style that is both unique and feels true to the original cartoons. It's not like this film adds anything new to the franchise, but it's a good introduction for the up-and-coming generation to Charlie Brown, Snoopy and the rest of the gang."
" Amazing!
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,10,"This movie is just amazing, the animation is amazing, the jokes are amazing. I love this movie"
" Great.
",2018-12-17 00:00:00,8,"Anyone knows the ""Peanuts"", Charlie Brown and his dog, Snoopy. Even those who do not like comics have seen or know the drawings of the late Charles Schulz. Of course, I'm no exception and I can even say that, along with the Disney characters (Mickey, Donald Duck etc.), this was one of my first contacts with the comic book universe.In this film, entirely in CGI, we can see all the characters of the comic strip, as Charlie Brown lives his first love and tries to catch the attention of his beloved doing something remarkable, and failing round with every attempt. The film ends well, of course, and it may be more appealing to adults who already know and love the characters than they do for more childish audiences, who will see and like it, but may not yet know the characters. For adults, and for connoisseurs, the film is enjoyable because it strictly respects the comic strip. The characters have not changed at all. They are as they should be, as Schulz imagined and designed them. Even the stroke and the color were respected, without any attempt to modernize or rethink the drawings. Something that we have not seen and that we miss, for example, in films like ""Tintin: the Secret of the Licorne"", of 2011, that raised so many expectations to gore them almost entirely next.I had few expectations when I first started watching this movie. I thought I was going to be too childish, or that I was going to run over the legacy of the original creator. I'm glad I was wrong. Although not too adult to take away children, it is faithful enough to the original material to please everyone and also captivate the affection of adults."
" Charlie Brown meets CGI
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,3,"Review: I am torn with this movie because I love every aspect except for the fact that they destroyed it by choosing to use CGI instead of keeping it a cartoon like all the other Charlie Brown movie. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this three out
of a possible five stars."
" Holding to tradition, The Peanuts Movie is timeless
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,10,"The Peanuts are timeless. Charlie Brown is timeless. We still read the comics and watch the holiday specials every year because there's nothing quite like them. They're wholesome yet comical. This rendition manages to capture what we love so much about the classic Peanuts and incorporates it with a new, unique twist that provides a nostalgic but fresh take on the characters that we hold so dearly."
" FIRST THERE WAS WAR. THEN THERE WAS PEACE
",2018-04-27 00:00:00,7,"This feature is similar to ""You're in Love, Charlie Brown."" It includes all the cliche bits we have seen a dozen times before. BTW I have never really warmed up to Woodstock which they insist on putting into every film.I loved the old cartoons, and indeed they attempted to use similar voices. In that regard they did fairly decent except for Charlie Brown and Lucy, the two main characters. The film starts out in winter and seems days later it is the middle of summer. The film avoids all holiday or religious themes as Chuck does a book report on ""Leo's Toy Store"" by Warren Peace.The theme is that Charlie Brown is a good man with good intentions under all of his ""failures"" and that is what is important. It was so much like what was already done, I was not overly entertained."
" Great film!
",2018-03-18 00:00:00,10,"This was a very cool film. I like how they stuck to what Chuck was!
Anyone remember Rose is Rose? Calvin and Hobbes?"
" Too light
",2018-01-17 00:00:00,6,"First off, it's my obligation to mention I the reviewer personally only watched the Charlie Brown and Snoopy cartoons every so often and couldn't say I grew up on them, but as an adult now certainly have a feel for what it was all about, its atmosphere and spirit; it's just I wasn't a diehard connoisseur.I preface this review by saying that as the nostalgic effect on me was only temporary and evaporated pretty soon into the developments. However, it felt SO COOL and exciting to see Charlie Brown and Snoopy and the whole gang again and they did a fine job hyping up the event in the early stages. They did an amazing job reconstructing the Charlie Brown appeal both in spirit as more tangibly in the drawings: this here is a 3D rendition of the characters and backgrounds, only boosted with computer-generated virtual motion and it's absolutely superbly done: all the authenticity and pure Peanuts aesthetics preserved, but adapted into the modern mold carefully and most subtly and with excellent attention to detail.However, as mentioned the effect only lasts so long and this film needs to be critiqued as a film for adults, as millennial kids hardly know anything about it and it is obviously aimed at the then-children/now-adult portion of society. So it's a film for grownups; nostalgic grownups; not kids. And as a film for adults, it's just way too thin. It's got the good old morals, the story is easy to follow, the characters each in their own way are funny and cute... but the parts with Snoopy vs the Red Baron turn self-indulgent very quickly and overall the emotionally-charged laughs quickly turn into mere snorts then into polite smiles.It's cute, it's fun, it kept the spirit of the original and preserved the visual appeal outstandingly....but it's not enough as a FILM. A generous 6/10."
" Enjoyable kids film
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,6,"'The Peanuts Movie' (or 'Snoopy and Charlie Brown: The Peanuts Movie', as it's billed in some places) seems long overdue, seeing as Charles M. Schulz's Peanuts comic strip has been around since 1950. Since he passed away in 2000, Schulz's children have done well continuing on his legacy, as this film honours him and Peanuts well - the animation is quaint at times, but detailed and colourful when needed.The whole Peanuts gang is here - the klutz Charlie Brown (Schnapp), the nagging Lucy (Miller), Charlie's best friend Linus (Garfin), the odd-pair Patty & Marcie, Charlie's sister Sally, the followed-by-a-cloud-of-dust Pig-Pen and, of course, Snoopy the beagle and Woodstock the bird. The film's set in winter, so there's plenty of snow and ice skating, and plenty of opportunities for Charlie Brown to embarrass himself. Plot = new girl moves in across the road, Charlie Brown spends the entire movie trying to impress/talk to her!This director has form, with 'Horton Hears a Who!' and does well to keep things happening, especially when Snoopy's daydreaming and dogfighting in the European WWI skies against the Red Baron! The other adult reference kids won't get is Charlie Brown reading Leo Tolstoy's 'War and Peace' - a 1,200+ page book for his book report - and asking for ""Leo's Toy Store"" at the library! I didn't like the weird sounds they used in place of adults/teachers, but otherwise it's well made."
" Just like the original: amusing...and too long
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,5,"The good news is that this movie captures the best of Peanuts animated specials: adult neuroses via childlike dialogue, amusing visual gags, charming characters. The bad news is that it also captures the worst of those tv shows: minimal plot, random/long Snoopy interludes and self serious thematic speeches. The animation style was perfect (and beautiful), but the movie was still uneven."
" Simply Wonderful
",2017-12-09 00:00:00,9,"I have never seen ANYTHING Peanuts related except the occasional comic strip (blasphemy I know ha-ha), but I LOVE this movie!The animation is wonderful, it stays true to the original comic style, while bringing it successfully into 3D animation.The story/characters are very wholesome/entertaining (Everyone has a character moment). Also, this film doesn't ape off previously iconic moments, its a lovely little movie on it's own merits.A must watch!"
" Could Not Have Been Done Better Any Other Way
",2017-10-30 00:00:00,8,"Even though Calvin & Hobbes will always remain my favorite comic strip of all time, Peanuts definitely remains another favorite for its simplistic charm, humor and lovable characters. So what happens when it gets adapted into a movie by Blue Sky Studios? Well, just get the son and grandson of the creator of Peanuts, Charles Schulz, to co-write and co-produce the film, and you get a film worth watching like this.The plot centers around Charlie Brown (Noah Schnapp) trying to prove he is more than just an average kid, and trying to win over the affection of a little red-haired girl (Francesca Capaldi) and soon becomes popular by doing what he thought never could have happened, and a subplot where Charlie Brown's dog Snoopy (Bill Melendez) imagines himself as the WWI Flying Ace trying to take down the Red Baron and save his love Fifi (Kristen Chenoweth) all in story form. What would be a rather weak and pretty average plot in other movies works really well in this movie, because Peanuts was always simple, easy to follow, and fun to get into. Not only does this movie succeed so well in capturing the charm and wit of the comics and cartoons, but it even captures it's style of humor and nostalgia. The jokes move at a quick pace, the visual gags are well animated albeit a little repetitive, and the sense of childhood sentimentality remains delightful in every way.One semi-controversial quality about this movie is that the animation is CGI, but thanks to the wonderful animation team at Blue Sky, they were able to turn the classic Peanut characters into 3 dimensions, and still make them look l2D. The characters look just like how they did in the original cartoons, the animation on them is simple and fluid, the backgrounds look very beautiful as well as imaginative, and even the effects look superb. Also, there are little instances when there is some 2D animation mixed in, so don't think 2D animation is lost in the film. Not to mention, there are dances and movements very similar to classic dances performed by the Peanuts in a Charlie Brown Christmas.As for the characters, they're all the same gang that we've come to love and expect. First off, there's Charlie Brown, the lonely kid with bad luck who wants to make a change in the world. What makes Charlie Brown such a memorable and likable character in this is that we feel for him and want him to succeed, and he'll do whatever it takes to be a winner, like being honest, brave, and caring to his sister and dog. There's also Snoopy, his little companion dog who is by his side and is there to entertain the audience, Lucy Van Pelt (Hadley Belle Miller), the bossy and snobbish girl who acts like a real jerk to others, and the Little Red-Haired Girl (yes, that's her literal name), the love interest who admires Charlie Brown for the person he is.There's also characters who support Charlie Brown like Linus Van Pelt, Marcie, Schroeder, and his sister Sally Brown. Even Peppermint Patty and an unnamed little kid have a good connection to the story and aren't just there for the heck of it. Fifi herself is just Snoopy's average love-interest and that's it though, she's not fully dimensional, but she does give Snoopy a nice goal to find his true love. Although some characters like Franklin, Violet, Patty, Pig-Pen, and even Shermy and Frieda are just there and don't contribute that much to the story, the rest of the characters still make the movie fun to get into.But it wouldn't be Peanuts without a good voice cast and splendid music to go with it. Since the old Peanuts cartoons always used child actors instead of adults, this one has child actors as well, and they were perfect. They all gave out the perfect vibe for each character they voiced, and it really sounds like they put their all into it. They even took archive-footage of Bill Melendez's vocal effects for Snoopy and Woodstock, and they fit in rather well. And the best part about the soundtrack is not only the original, lighthearted, and even epic score by Christophe Beck, but also the jazzy, upbeat, and whimsical music by original Peanuts composer, Vince Guaraldi. The film does contain a couple modern day pop songs, and they flow beautifully by aiding the story and characters, as well as give quite humorous montages.With the charm, wit, humor, and overall fun that the original series contained put in a blender, The Peanuts Movie offers enough nostalgic memories to the people who grew up with the cartoon, and is faithful enough to introduce a new generation onto the cartoon and series. This is a must- watch for anyone who loves the Peanuts, or is in the mood for a film for the whole family. There once was a quote by Charles Schultz himself entitled, ""If I were to be given the opportunity to present a gift to the next generation, it would be the ability for each individual to learn to laugh at himself."", and that sums up this movie perfectly. This movie was not made just to make a quick buck, it was made to present Peanuts again and let it enter the hearts and memories of children, just like how it happened back then. Adults who were once kids will soon introduce the comics and cartoons that they grew up with to their kids, and this movie is a perfect example on introducing the world to the Peanuts from generation to generation. Of all the Charlie Brown's in the world, this movie was the Charlie Browniest."
" The Peanuts Movie Review
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,10,I am a massive Charlie Brown fan and I went to go see this December 22nd 2015 in 3D and found it very cute. It is a movie that fans of the original comic strip will appreciate but even non fans will get appreciation out of it. I recommend this movie for anyone with kids.The films plot is about Charlie Brown trying to win the affection of The Little Red Haired Girl while Snoopy goes up against The Red Baron.what is good about the movie is the Animation to not only respect Charles Schulz's original drawings but to make their eyes and mouths 2D And heavy use of black lines.however the bad thing was I Felt that The Red Baron scenes were not needed that does not help Charlie Brown win The Girls affections
" Not Small Peanuts
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,8,"When I heard that they were making a CGI Peanuts movie a couple of years back, I got nervous. I didn't want them update this classic material, of which I proudly grew up on with my whole family, to modern times, so it can laughably become dated in the next decade. To my delight, they didn't do any of that. The film is as true to the original comics as any Peanuts TV special in the past. They use the 50 year old, tried and true formula, and even in the decade of IPhones, and memes and hashtags, the Peanuts are still as charming as ever. Seemingly frozen in time, it tells a story of how Charlie Brown tries to overcome his status as the neighborhood sad sack, and be as cool as the other kids. He realizes in the end, that you need to love yourself, in order for others to love you. Meanwhile Snoopy goes on another Red Baron adventure, and it's created fabulously in CGI. I don't think the film is as deep or as insightful as I wanted it to be (no Pixar edge), But I adored the animation, and the seamless voice work from the all-children cast. Hearing archival audio from Bill Melendez for the voices of Snoopy and Woodstock was a fantastic touch."
" Sweet and nostalgic
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,8,"A sweet movie about the shy Charlie Brown who has a crush on a the new girl. He tries to impress her by ""being a winner"" instead off the boring kid that he used to be. Meanwhile his dog Snoopy goes on a flying adventure to rescue his new found love, Fifi...I liked this movie a lot. I loved that I finally get to see the face off the red-head from the Cartoon.I liked her as a person. She was seemed really smart and sweet. This movie is really funny great but even though I don't like the new art style that much but I got used to it. The characters were great and just like the series which maked me feel nostalgic since I am a big fan off the cartoon.I think the movie's message is that you should be yourself and believe in yourself to never give up. I love a ""feeling good movie""Although I find the Snoopy flying story a bit boring but otherwise this movie was great but it could have been a bit longer or more Charlie Brown scenes and less Snoopy flying around..."
" Maybe it was a cash grab all along...
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,5,"Note: this is a six out of ten kind of deal but I'm ranking it five out of ten just to slightly offset the current ranking. So I finally got a chance to watch this and I'm sad to report it is a letdown. I should say it is a letdown if you are a huge fan of the original cartoons and comic strips. I did not have a problem with the animation or voice actors or anything technical that took away from the pen to paper or pencil to paper traditional stuff. The actual plot/story/jokes/etc are all generic and lack any soul. All the jokes fall flat. For the first 20 minutes of the film they jam-packed in all the lovable little quarks we grew up watching in the old movies but it feels almost like whoever wrote them into the story did it like an annoying little checklist they had to get out of the way and not because they fit into the story or anything. And the stupid film keep showing Snoopy battle the Red Baron over and over again. Sure, the message of the film is a good one but the movie isn't good. It is hardy average."
