" Awesome
",2021-04-07 00:00:00,10,"If I could give this a higher rating than 10, I would. This is one of the best faith based movies I've ever seen. This movie will strengthen your faith and make you want to pray more and let God fight your battles for you. Every actor did phenomenal in their role and Karen Abercrombie was exceptional! I would have thought she was a minister in real life. I would strongly recommend this movie!"
" Very inspiring!
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,10,I loved this film...very powerful message and challenging in its message of the power of prayer!
" OPP (Other People Prayers)
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,4,"Now if you thought I meant anything or something else by OPP you may just be Naughty by Nature ... Pun very much intended. But this may then not speak to you, because this is about Jesus and about believing and about Christianity. About doing the right thing. This may or could also be considered ""propaganda"" by some - and I'm not telling you how to feel about it either way.What I am telling you is how you should be prepared when it comes to this movie. More prepared than just telling an attacker to put his knife down in the name of Jesus ... you probably should not try this at home - or whereever you are being robbed at. Now you may have concluded that I may be a bit of an .. sarcastic person and you would have made quite the right observation. Still I do understand that some people of faith may very well see this and feel empowered by it. Not trying to take anything away from them.And while this may be aimed at a certain group of people (not just religious ones), I'd say it is meant to be enjoyed by all Christians no matter their skin color ... as long as their believe is strong. I may be wrong of course - however if you are not bying into the whole premise of the movie, you better stay away, because this will be quite the cringe worthy watch otherwise ... (I did like the competition at the end and the result, that sends a nice message too ... though the very last frame is praying again ... whatever that means to you)"
" A Christian Woman's Marriage Improves When She Comes Out Of The Closet.
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,2,"I'm a Christian and faith based movies are my favorite genre of film, with The Prince of Egypt and Ben-Hur on the Biblical end and The Apostle and Silence on the Christian end.I also enjoy the Kendrick Brothers movies(like Fireproof and Courageous). I understand that they're not Citizen Kane, but they have their heart in the right place and I find them moving and faith-inspiring. On that note, I used to like War Room, and in fact a couple years ago I watched it on Christmas Day. But there are issues that I have had with the movie that I can no longer ignore. That's what I intend to analyze here.The plot follows a realtor named Elizabeth, who's marriage is falling apart since her husband Tony is selfish, away from home all the time, a womanizer, and simply a jerk. Elizabeth gets frustrated and doesn't know what to do.(Divorce is never brought up, but Jesus would have allowed it in this case- Matthew 5:32 arguably could be used for this justification.) Enter Ms. Clara, a very devout Christian who is selling her house.Ms. Clara gets nosy about Elizabeth's marriage, and finds out that she isn't very active in her faith. So Ms. Clara shows her a closet- her War Room. Here, she prays out her concerns and God over time eventually answers them. She therefore encourages for Elizabeth to make her own War Room and pray for her marriage to heal. And it also works for her. After all, there is no Satan in here, this is the War Room!From a Christian perspective, I do kind of like this movie. I don't think it's boring, and there are moments I really enjoy. For example, there is a scene where a man with a knife tries to rob Elizabeth and Ms. Clara and instead of complying, Ms. Clara says: ""You put that knife down, in the name of Jesus!"" That's a funny scene, and other portions are enjoyable on their own.But there are numerous problems with the movie, in story and in theology. I will start with theology first.Prayer is certainly an important part of Christian living. Jesus encourages us to pray, and even though He was God in the flesh He constantly prayed to God the Father. But how prayer works in the War Room is not Biblical, nor does it work in real life, where the moral is supposed to be lived out.Here's a prime example: In one scene, Elizabeth is in her closet praying after receiving a text that her husband is having dinner with another woman. She prays for God to ""stand in his way"" and as soon as she says ""Amen"", he gets up from the table and pukes from food poisoning.""God, stop Tony from being adulterous.""""Okay, I'll give him FOOD POISIONING!""What is this, the vengeful God of the Old Testament? Also, I understand that this is supposed to demonstrate that God can answer our prayers, and that is certainly true. But God is not a genie. We shouldn't expect Him to be Robin Williams in Aladdin.I was abused when I was 14(7.5 years ago) and I had to pray everyday for about a year for it to end. My stepfather was never sick from my prayers, nor did God intervene during a prayer. I had to wait for His will to come through for my suffering to end. If I had prayed to the god of War Room, I wouldn't have gone through half the things I did.But apparently that's how prayer works here. The more Elizabeth prays, the better Tony becomes. Kendrick Brothers movies are no stranger to this philosophy, but usually it happens overtime. Grant in Facing The Giants didn't get his new car, fertile wife, and winning team all in one prayer. That all came gradually. Here, it seemed to be boom, boom, boom- blessings from Heaven on sale.Onto the story level, War Room has a ton of problems as well. The Kendrick Brothers like to put comedy in their films, and they are usually some of the best scenes. In Fireproof, they have the Wrath of God hot sauce scene, and in Courageous there is the scene where Javi orders lunch in Spanish in a threatening manner.War Room has jokes that may work the first time but go stale overtime. Ms. Clara delivers a few of these. When she sees Elizabeth using a smartphone, Ms. Clara says: ""Oh, you have one of those smartphones. I can only talk on my cell phone. It must be a dumb phone."" In another scene, Ms. Clara is showing Elizabeth around her house and she says that one of her favorite rooms is her ""sitting room.""""What do you do here?""""Mostly sit.""THAT is the humor here. Elizabeth also has a smelly feet problem and many jokes are about that! In another scene, a postman subtly jokes about her bad morning breath.The movie is 2 hours long and yet there are scenes that could be cut out. For example, Tony and his daughter Danielle do a Double Dutch tournament and it has no service to the story. Yes, it shows a Dad re-connecting with his daughter, but that was shown before. (I used to watch a YouTube channel called Christian Nutrition, and he mentions that it's pointless in one of his reviews- ""The Cheating Scales of Bullamanka."")I also mentioned how Ms. Clara gets nosy about Elizabeth's personal life. Even when I liked the movie, I found it cringy that she would be so pushy and preachy to Elizabeth. Again, I'm a Christian too, but if I walked into a stranger's house and they started saying I need to pray more and all that, I would feel really awkward.The Kendrick Brothers usually make good Christian movies, that is, when compared to movies like God's Not Dead. However, I have to consider this to be a fork in the road for them in all honesty. I didn't even cover every issue I could point out, but you get the idea. I do support their work though, in fact the post-War Room movie of theirs, Overcomer, is their best film yet. (Consider that to be my ""reverse recommendation"".)Here's my main advice to them- Martin Luther once met a cobbler who had just become a Christian. He asked Luther how he could be a good Christian shoemaker. Luther told him this, and I'm paraphrasing: ""A good Christian cobbler doesn't show his faith by putting crosses on his shoes. He shows his faith by making good shoes.""I fully support the Kendrick Family making faith based movies, but I don't think they should be like War Room, which simply has a cross on the cover. Instead, they should put faith to film simply by making good films.Post-Review Note: One of my favorite YouTubers, Say Goodnight Kevin, has a review that digs deeper into the problem War Room has. It's an excellent video and a worthy alternative to the movie- you can see the major scenes and see it's flaws explained well. He also has a podcast where he interviews the director Alex Kendrick in the 2nd episode, which is riveting.In the podcast, Alex says that he welcomes constructive criticism for his movies. I hope, if he reads my review, that he takes this to heart in the well-meaning way that I intend. He is one of my favorite directors, I just hope he heeds my critiques."
" Wonderful film
",2020-12-23 00:00:00,8,"The movie demonstrates in very clear ways the power of prayer that many Christians have experienced on a regular basis. The movie goes a step farther in revealing a Biblical prayer strategy for destroying the work of the devil in a person's life. The movie builds people up, gives them hope, and reminds them of God's ways, and the wonderful victory that is found only in Christ Jesus. U"
" Grace!
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,8,Definitivamente esse filme não é pra qualquer um. Você tem que querer conhecer melhor a Cristo e a si mesmo. Eu amei de todo meu coração pois Ele é o Senhor da minha vida. This movie is definitely not for everyone. You have to want to know Christ and yourself better. I loved with all my heart because He is the Lord of my life.#movieslover #christianmovies #netflix
" Great film!
",2020-12-09 00:00:00,7,"Overall a great message of hope and redemption! The style is similar to all Kendrick movies, in which, the acting can be a little forced and it looks more for tv, but the storyline is always very good."
" Refresh an idea to raise as an army of God
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,9,"This is simple explanation about how is the prayer should be done as ever told since Christ era, no need to be seen by others and that's the key to truly get an answer., I'm glad to watch this movie for giving an idea what should be done since long time ago"
" This movie looks like it was made by me.
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,1,"Boring cinematography, trash acting, I mean come on PureFlix, make something with at least some effort."
" Absolutely Fantastic
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,10,Talk about the power of God to intervene in our everyday lives & do the impossible.
" A must-watch!
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,10,I love this powerful movie! It is so well done and life-changing.
" Great movie
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,9,"Great movie to inspire ,loved it.... will watch again and would recommend.."
" Made my filmmaker son laugh.
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,7,"I liked this movie a lot, but the best thing about it is that it made my filmmaker son laugh . He's pretty critical of Christian movies, but he liked the older woman (""the yoda character"" he called her) mentoring the younger. It's well worth watching."
" Inspiring and uplifting
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,10,"This movie is a very believable and engaging representation of very real relationships and issues. The characters are entertaining, funny, lovable, and easy to identify with. The story kept my attention and made me cry, laugh, and left me feeling encouraged and stronger in my faith."
" Great movie!!
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,9,This movie was amazing. The characters were believable. It dealt with real issues and struggles of today. I set up my own wat room after watching this!!
" Miss Clara makes this movie
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,8,A message we all need to hear and the faith of Miss Clara we should strive for. There is much power in prayer. The ending prayer of Miss Clara I have watched over and over again. Certainly worth seeing.
" Very good
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,8,"An amazing Christian movie with wholesome values. What else do you need? This movie is fantastic and underrated. My teenage son said he didn't like it, but I think he will soon with the help of God."
" The POWER of PRAYER demonstrated in War Room
",2020-04-08 00:00:00,8,"Love how this movie emphasizes the importance and power of prayer. Demonstrates how we can all be prayer warriors, developing our own special place to pray with purpose. Love how the character of Clara is so persistent with her real estate sales agent to encourage a change in her prayer life. I watched it with my girlfriend and we were each so glad we watched it and how it will help us develop an improved prayer life."
" Great movie!
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,10,"This movie was great both in the story line and in the acting. It shows a real-life family who is struggling with things that many people can relate to in one way or another. When the family comes to a point where all hope seems lost and they decide to place their faith and trust in Jesus, the story shows how their lives are transformed for the better.This movie shows the power of prayer and relationships and truly encourages others to always remember the power of prayer and meditation. It is a family-friendly movie that I would encourage all families to watch together!"
" The Power of prayer
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,8,A beautiful Christian movie on the power of prayer. A must watch-watch for the entire family.
" A motivational movie
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,8,"This is definitely one of those encouraging feel good movies. It had a lot of good scenes and some of the dialogues do stay with you after watching. A good storyline that reminds us of the power of prayer. And yes as a movie made on a tight budget, some of the slickness of a Hollywood movie is lacking. But if you are willing to overlook that, it is a truly motivating movie"
" Loved it
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,10,"Yes I am a Christian and yes I pray every day. And yes I loved this movie. It's a great story and a great example of what is possible when we are ready to fight for things of value rather than take the so called ""easy way out"".A great faith based picture which will encourage you to seek God and fight through hard times, highly recommended!"
" Myasia Review for a Great Movie
",2019-12-08 00:00:00,10,"This movie does a great job with getting the audience attention and making it both great for parents and children to watch. War room displays humor and heart by having a couple who have great careers, a nice home , and the perfect daughter. But in reality there life isn't so great as it seems. The couple is always at war with one another leaving the daughter stuck in the middle . They have to seek guidance from an older woman who simply tells them to stop fighting each other , and to start fighting for them . In the end, they are counting on the power of prayer to save their marriage. This particular movie really touched me , and I'll definitely go see it again if given the chance . I think others should go see it too."
" A perfect guidemap for marriages
",2019-10-25 00:00:00,10,"This is the goto movie for every marriages that are going through a rough patch. Highlights in the best way, what we can do to change the things that bother us. Surrendering, submission, forgiveness and redemption all brought together beautifully."
" Healing!
",2019-10-01 00:00:00,10,This movie is powerful. It made me laugh. It made me cry hard. It made me think. And it reminded me of the grace and mercy that the Lord gives me.
" More a video sermon than an actual movie.
",2019-05-17 00:00:00,4,"If you're looking for a movie with extremely cliche and stereotypical characters spouting stiff and unrealistic dialogue, this is the movie for you. Honestly, it would have worked better as an after-school special than a full-blown movie. I understand the concepts it's trying to convey, but perhaps a non-fiction book would have been a better format. In fact, I think this movie almost does more harm than good in its goal to reach non-Christians. Or was that it's goal in the first place?"
" Non-Christians need to stop attacking this movie for it's message!
",2019-04-11 00:00:00,9,"I'm convinced many reviewed this movie without even seeing it. IMDB should not allow people to attack a movie because of it's message. This is a Christian movie, made by Christians. WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING?! An even better question is, why did you bother wasting your time watching a movie that you knew you were not going to agree with? I would not watch a movie glorifying atheism.
So, if you're reading this, just ignore all of the whining about the message of this movie, because obviously an atheist/non-believer is going to give it a low rating.
I'm an intelligent and wise adult, so I am, of course, a devout Christian. But I don't get on here and look for movies about things that I don't like or don't believe in the message  and attack the movies message. I'm almost sure that's NOT what the folks that run this website want. I'm not sure really why they even allow it. But anyway....even putting the movie's Christian message aside, the movie great. The acting will not win an Oscars, but it's dramatic and uplifting and Christians will love it. Non-believers probably will not, so if you are an atheist, why bother watching something you know you're not going to agree with or like?"
" i liked it
",2019-04-07 00:00:00,8,"I think Dish gave War Room two stars, but i watched it anyway and am glad i did. they made the case for the genuine personality changes that took place in the characters. not a big one for agenda-driven films, this crossed the threshhold into a film that was worthy of being seen regardless of having an agenda. if i am going to watch this type of film, this message of faith and trust, that, to the extent it can take place, would help a lot of families. am i drinking the kool-aid? maybe, but it is a good kool-aid to drink. the actors did a good job. the mom reminded me of Michelle Obama, and i wonder if that was done on purpose. i don't like Michelle Obama. this film was Conservative in message, but seems to have a perhaos misleading Democrat element, in that a Christian association with the Obamas would not be an accurate representation."
" War Room
",2019-03-25 00:00:00,7,"It's the power of prayer...
it's easy to keep our realtion with God..
not easy to forgive.. but with God we can
great movie"
" The efficacy of prayer
",2019-03-18 00:00:00,4,"Prayer changes things. Yes, prayer is a panacea. Miss Clara made my day. The ice cream scene was my best. Nonetheless, man shant live by bread alone."
" Indifferent
",2019-03-12 00:00:00,3,"Our fellowship screened two movies this Sunday. WAR ROOM (2015) and CHAINS (2019). I've been questioning my Faith for the past two years. Now I call myself a Christian freethinker. After watching these two movies I'm getting the more confused and indifferent. WAR ROOM prescribes prayer as the solution to every problem, in the case of WAR ROOM a woman in an abusive marriage just needs to pray and all will be well (not true!) Divorce is the key. In CHAINS, two families suffer because of the sins of their parents (one parent's sin is unforgiveness while the other is rape). I left the fellowship feeling traumatised and I dunno why. I shouldn't have seen this movie. Even though our pastor raised prayer points from the movie which I prayed too, I want to delete this movie from my head. The world isn't an ok place."
" Not the movie for me.
",2019-03-07 00:00:00,1,"And by ""me"" I mean not somebody who tends to go for these movies. Christian movies tend to fall into two camps. There's the one made with a good story, good acting and is used to tell a story to change hearts and minds. And then there's things like this that are only good for preaching to the already converted. One of these movies is good. The other one is bad. Can you guess which one this is?This movie is pretty much what you get when you think a sitcom writer making a movie. Namely you get sitcom writing. Let me give you an example in the main character of the story Miss Clara. She's the wise old lady character that sits in her chair and delivers the zingers. You know the type. She takes no guff from anybody and always has a line to put people in their place. She mentors a young wife who's husband is cheating on her and being a bit of a slime by stealing and selling medical supplies on the side.That's all well and good and honestly I'd have no problem with something like this but the way to do it is where we get the title from. She's got her ""war room"". That's a closet that she tapes up prayers and shouts them to God. In other words trying to get God to intercede on her behalf. But here's the thing. If God is omnipresent. And God knows all. And God sees all. Why does he need somebody telling him what to do? Shouldn't he know? Of course he should but then we wouldn't have a movie now would we?So much is made about free will but in this we see a woman pray to God to give her husband food poisoning so that he doesn't wind up sleeping with another woman. How is that exercising free will? It's not but the makers of this movie seem to think it's okay to do.And then in the end we get a rather chilling voice over in which Miss Clara preaches to get religious folk into places of power to in effect take over. That's not necessarily a good thing. We have a separation of church and state for a reason in this country. All you need to do is look at religious countries and see how messed up they are. I mean, isn't that what's going on in the Middle East? And look how well they're doing."
" This Movie Changed My Life!
",2019-01-24 00:00:00,10,"I can see how this movie could be taken different ways by viewers who are in different places with God in their own lives.Personally, I believe this was the most amazing movie ever put together! Not because of the acting, the production value or the writing. Although nothing to scoff at with the low budget they set out with. This is the most amazing movie ever because it teaches you how to pray!!!I was raised in the church and was always there until I was about 16-17, I went about a decade straying from Gods path, and found myself truly needing a HUGE wake-up call. I was struggling in every single area of my life, similar to the story.After realizing I needed to change, I have been praying more than ever the last few weeks. I've been going back to church, and I had been purging sin from my life in every way possible, yet something was still missing...My mom kept telling me about this movie and gave it to me to watch.I finally felt like I was at an all-time low, yet I was praying and trying so hard to be close to god, so I called her and said what do I do? She asked me If I had watched this movie and I said no I still haven't. She urged me to do so and I did...Let me tell you, I have never written a movie review. I love great movies and I haven't seen many if any Christian movies since my youth.THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING MOVIE EVER! IF YOU ARE STRUGGLING IN LIFE OR WITH GOD YOU MUST WATCH THIS MOVIE! IT TEACHES YOU HOW TO PRAY THE RIGHT WAY!As I said I was raised in the church, went to Christian schools, and really thought I knew what I was doing when it came to god. Yet I felt as if I knew nothing after watching this movie. I learned how to make a prayer strategy, kick myself off of the throne of my heart and let God take the reins. I prayed harder and longer than I ever have before as soon as I finished the movie. If you watch this movie just to watch the movie, I'm sure you will enjoy it. If you watch the movie to learn how to pray and immediately apply what you have learned, you will have the best prayer and new strategy for daily prayer you have ever been graced with. I felt immediately better, I felt as if God finally took the wheel, and now I have him fighting all of my battles, I stepped aside, and I truly feel the power of Christ. Every Christian home should teach their children how to pray like this and watch this movie. I am so thankful for the people who made it. Thank you!!!! I can't wait to show it to everyone.Hats off to you all and thanks again!
#1. Create a prayer strategy!
#2. Get in that War Room!
#3. Start strategizing with God so he can go to war for you!He will take over! Thank you again I feel so blessed to have seen this movie!!! 💚"
" Virtuous Motion for Marriage Victims
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,9,In a world that have so many problems within the family especially the marriage institution this perfectly shows you how to ride out the storm by an lawful Female Character named Elizabeth Jordan who was definitely a long-suffering woman to be bearing all these issues from her husband Tony Jordan. Elizabeth became a Christian after this elderly lady Miss Clara introduced her to God and also show her some strategy to fight her martial problems. After she learn them she created a place in her closet for her prayer room identified as War Room.
" Aunt Esther with a plan
",2018-08-14 00:00:00,3,"I was actually ready to like the film except that a coda put on at the end of the
film after the story was concluded. Makes it abundantly clear that War Room
takes the my way or the highway view of God.T.C. Stallings and Priscilla Shirer are at first glance a happy and upwardly mobile
company. He's a top salesman for a pharmaceutical firm and she sells real estate
while also raising their daughter. Not obvious is the fact that the marriage is
straining on his end and Shirer is at her wit's end to try and save it.She comes under the influence of Karen Abercrombie an old church lady who
is something of a sage. Her remedy is strengthen your own faith through prayer and sooner or later hubby will come around.Stallings is even given another chance by his company after confession and
restitution of all the money he's been charging as expenses on those road
trips for sales. That was a bit much.Abercrombie comes across like Aunt Esther with a purpose. The coda I mention refers to her prayer voicing over some newsreel type film asking God
to raise up a nation of believers in every walk of life who will impose fundamentalist values on this country whether we like it or not. If nonbelievers aren't welcome it's our way or else. Not a message to warm my
soul I can tell you."
" An honest review without being tainted by Christian haters and a blind devotion to Christianese films
",2018-07-08 00:00:00,7,"Reading the reviews, all I see is 1s and 10s. My word, is there no such thing as true objectivity anymore?I've been following the Kendrick brothers films from the very beginning. Their earliest works are admittedly cheesy bad, but an extremely limited budget could be to blame for that. Watching this film, I felt it was quite an improvement and it is good to see that with each new release, they have attempted to up the production value a little more. Trust me when I say, the acting is WAY better than the earlier projects, although art direction, continuity and other issues still can be improved. While no Hollywood blockbuster, the film has the same kind of quality as a made-for-TV Hallmark film. A little syrupy at times, but overall enjoyable.In regards to the message, I find it laughable when the haters jump on and complain that religious producers should not make movies that bash their religion over your head. That's the whole point. It's their art. Art is designed to communicate the message of the creator. If you don't like the message, don't watch the art. No one's bashing anything. Those who watch the film, do so electively. Nor did I ever get the sense, as many of the critics have suggested, that the main character, a wife, should just stay in an abusive relationship and do nothing and prayer would magically make all things better. That message is not preached in this film. The film's objective was not to focus on the external stuff we do to improve our lives, it was designed to focus on the spiritual efforts. Just because it focused on one, doesn't automatically mean the other doesn't exist. And the movie made it really clear that one doesn't pray for things to magically get better, it prays that we would get a better sense of the understanding and heart of God, and through that, OUR own actions actually DO change. And it's the changing of our actions, brought about through prayer, that can often change the external. Yes, there were cheesy moments. Yes, there were typical feel good moments. But that's what the target audience wants and is looking for. If that's not your cup of tea, that doesn't mean it makes a bad movie. The story moved, and that is what is important, even if the story seemed predictable, and at certain moments, seemed like certain plot twists were added last minute. The movie is less about the plot than it is about the message, and that does become painfully obvious at times. The message was thick, but going in, one should know that this is by design, and should be expected. While the message was heavy, I never felt like the film was preachy. And for that, I feel they did a really good job. I could nitpick about other things, such as art direction (better lighting, camera angles, variance in pacing...), but I think I will end the review here. Acting: 8, Story: 6, Art Direction: 5, Production value: 6, Entertainment value: well, I guess that depends on your world view, apparently. I'd give it an 8."
" One of my favorite movies
",2018-04-18 00:00:00,10,This movie inspired me in so many ways. It helped my marriage a lot. Stephen Kendrick never fail to amaze me! I am so ready for the next one! Thank you so much!
" This movie grew on me!
",2018-02-20 00:00:00,7,"This movie grew on me.I usually don't watch these types of movies because I thought it would be a preachy cheesefest but this one grew on me the more I watched it!It has its moments of good and bad and its not selling itself as something it isn't which isn't a AAA movie, but it's a movie with a good and helpful message. So if you're more concerned about the content of a movie give this a try!"
" Victories don't happen by accident
",2018-01-13 00:00:00,10,"This review contains some plot points, but the film is not really plot driven per se.The movie opens with a narration by Miss Clara (Karen Abercrombie). Her husband, who had worked in a war room had died. She creates a prayer closet which she calls her ""war room."" Tony (T.C. Stallings) and Elizabeth (Priscilla C. Shirer) have martial problems. Elizabeth is a real estate agent who is selling Miss Clara's home. Clara has decided to take Elizabeth under her wing.I don't need to go any further at this point. You pretty much know the rest as God answers all prayers to those who know how to prayer correctly according to the Bible. There are themes of ""paying it forward"" and that ""God is in control.""The film is inspirational and my African-American friends thought if I watched this film, I would become a believer. My sister believes if everyone listens to country music, America would be great. This is another re-invent Christianity production complete with a church campaign kit, just like ""Do You Believe"" where a pastor ponders the cross for the first time in his life... and please buy the church kit which always give me mixed feelings on people profiting off the Bible.The end of the film closes with a prayer for America, while having good intentions and being inspirational, doesn't leave much room for religious diversity. 5 stars as a spiritual film."
" Its the message the counts
",2017-09-16 00:00:00,8,"Its a shame that this film has been negatively criticized the way it has been. This just demonstrates that some wish to close off their ears and not wish to hear the message behind the film. Its not the acting that should matter but the message itself. Its sad that in a world where there is so much hurting, some people do not wish to turn to prayer. It is perhaps the one thing that we need more than anything else.This movie should not solely target Christians but more especially it should reach non-Christians. I think that was the main purpose behind making this film. Its terribly sad that the world nowadays no longer wants to turn their eyes to the maker. They just want to turn to things that will not help them spiritually. I know who I am in the eyes of my maker and I will not waste an opportunity criticizing this film. Of course, there may have been one or two things that were not perfect about it but should not mean that we should ignore the underlying message behind it. What the world needs now more than ever is to repent and turn their eyes towards Jesus. I pray that film should not simply be a tool for criticism but it should reach those that are lost and continuing to hurt out there. I wish to reiterate that its not acting that counts but the message itself."
" Great movie for Christians wanting something uplifting and wholesome to watch.
",2017-08-25 00:00:00,10,"I just watched this movie at the suggestion of my mother. I laughed and did a lot of crying. Some of the negative critics may ask why but when you're a Christian and you know God is speaking to you through film or the bible or prayer it can be extremely touching. I loved everything about this movie. I loved the characters the acting, the story line. I look forward to watching it again tonight when my husband gets in. I don't believe this movie was meant to cram religion down people's throats. Christians want moves that will uplift and inspire us and this definitely did it for me. For those who aren't saved and couldn't find the good in this movie, I'm praying in my new war room for you."
" Is Prayer Enough To Solve Marital Difficulties?
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,10,"The new Kendrick Brothers' film ""The War Room"" is a humor-filled Christian movie that provides the inspiration message of the power of prayer. It stars first-time actress in Priscilla Shirer,who happens to be a Christian preacher, together with former football player-turned actor,T.C. Stallings.The story primarily deals with the husband-and-wife Elizabeth and Tony Jordan,who works as real estate agent and pharmaceutical salesman,that are currently undergoing marital problems.Tony is introduced to be verbally abusive husband particularly to his wife and works a lot to the point of not spending much time with his his child Danielle.Then,Elizabeth deals with a client named Clara in one of her house sales.Clara introduces to Elizabeth having a closet room wherein he spends time with God in prayer and tells her the importance of having a relationship with God.Elizabeth takes this message and begins to form a closet room of her own at her own and she starts doing her prayers as well as having a relationship with God in order to save their marriage and to address her marital difficulties particularly her relationship with Tony.Things begin to change in the process that made Tony become a better person both as a husband and a father.The End!!!No question that it definitely provides the viewer an inspiration message of prayer and having a relationship with God.The movie tells the viewer that prayer is extremely necessary in times of trials and challenges.This will turn off some viewers particularly non-Christians and people who do not believe in the power of prayer.These same people may view the transformation of Tony as unrealistic considering that he changed simply from being verbally abusive and adulterous to becoming a loving husband as well as a caring father only through the prayers that Elizabeth and Clara have made in their respective closet rooms.These same viewers want to see more such as Tony and Elizabeth go through marriage counseling and numerous dialogues to commit to their marriage.To them,prayer wound not be the simple solution to their marital problems and difficulties.Besides,was prayer enough too to make Elizabeth a more understanding wife?Being a Christian,I personally believe that prayer is an effective spiritual weapon.No question that lifting our personal battles to God is already a lot through prayer.Fellow Christians like me will definitely appreciate it.They will be inspired to pray and check their own relationship with God.It will also give them hope especially in tough and challenging times.Just what I have stated,prayer is a powerful spiritual weapon that may take care of our problems even worse than what Elizabeth was facing in this movie.It will also renew their trust and faith in God."
" Fully spiritual movie

" Most Mind Blowing/Exhilarating Production
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,10,"I am not a Christian but i believe immensely in God and this movie took my breathe away literally. I loved every minute of it. It touches base with so many adversities we have to face in life each day, some more than others but it was so inspiring. The power of prayer. Christian or not this movie helps teach and train the mind to disregard things that don't matter, things that tarnish our minds, our brains, our actions and relationships and it helps us to focus on what is important and how to receive inner healing. My gosh really really loved this movie, have to watch it again. Thank you to all for the beautiful story line, the directors, producers, actors/actresses and all those who help bring this sentiment to life."
" Boring cliché that hides bad writing behind heavy religious themes.
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,1,"The whole movie is riddled with bad effects, lines and even worse acting. Some parts of the acting are soo bad I literally cringed in my seat, it was a burden to sit through this movie with my family. The directer seems to have assumed they could cut every corner by throwing an ""amen"" or an ""praise Jesus"" here and there. They are trying to make a quick buck on peoples beliefs. My sister refused to talk about the shitty parts or even acknowledge they existed because she is so religious. I guess the directer got their wish..."
" Movie of the Century!
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,10,"This is such a POWER packed movie! I smiled, laughed, cried & worshiped GOD right in the movie theater. From beginning to end, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. This is a movie that I can watch over & over again and never get tired of it. From the producers of the movie to the actors & actresses, this was very well written & played. I applaud you all, kudos to you! There should be more Christian, GOD fearing movies like this that inspires, encourages, convicts and changes people's lives. I will FOREVER be changed by this movie, I will NEVER be the same again! All Glory be to GOD!!!"
" Possibly the most cringeworthy film ever made.
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,1,"It's not that I am against religion or that this review is anti-religion. It's because War Room has one of the worst morals I have ever seen.This movie is just propaganda for the kind of irrational behavior which plagues the world: the kind who lives in the past, the kind who take the bible way to seriously, the kind who don't vaccinate children against diseases, the kind who refuse to acknowledge equal rights to homosexuals or women, the kind who resort to violence if you say or do something against their religion. THE KIND WHO OPPOSE HUMAN PROGRESS.That kind of people created this 2-hour film and it is made especially for them. Do not fall for it, please skip it entirely. Thanks for reading."
