" Really funny
",2021-04-03 00:00:00,8,It's a very crude film I wouldn't recommend watching with your parents. It's very funny and crazy the story is very good and has excellent jokes.
" I was appalled by this film. Appalled, I tell you.
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,10,"I was appalled the first time I watched this movie. and then outraged the second time.Just to be sure I watched it 3 more times with my friends, still the same. It is childish, puerile and offensive on every level. AND SO DAMN FUNNY. I laughed like a drain all the way through, De Niro is hilarious as the randy old Grandpa, Aubrey Plaza is insanely funny and quite filthy. Poor Zac Efron is a delight as the hapless bridegroom. The beach scene where he is wearing nothing but the cuddly hornet had me crying with laughter. The wedding scene where bridezilla Meredith (Julianne Hough) gets her comeuppance is wonderful. I also loved the two cops with their own very personal take on what constitutes the law and Tan Pam (Jason Mantzoukas) as the local dealer is someone I'd like to know. OK it's not high art, or Cinema with a capital C. But it is really, really funny. I wish they'd had ""Spring Break"" when I was younger. If you don't laugh at this movie we can't be friends."
" Worst movie ever
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,1,"Worst movie I've ever seen. I was stuck in a show with friends who fell asleep seeing this, otherwise I would have left, ruNning as fast as possible away from this awful horrible movie. I hope DiNiro got paid lots of money for this role. He went way down in my estimation of him as an actor. I not only did not laugh once, I had to put my head in my hands half the movie. Whoever wrote this should never make another movie. Anyone who likes this must be a very immature person who doesn't know anything about comedy."
" Efron has no DE Niro.
",2021-02-11 00:00:00,10,I gave 10 stars. Five to Robert. Five for Ef-N-Ron hubba hubby... how do you spell his name. NOUN.
" Dirty Grandpa is a movie.
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,1,I have seen a lot of movies in my life. Dirty Grandpa is one of them.
" Only one question...
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,2,Robert De Niro still realizes that he is Robert De Niro???
" De Niro... Why?
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,2,"Dirty Grandpa is directed by Dan Mazer, written by John Phillips and stars Zac Efron, Robert De Niro, Aubrey Plaza, and Zoey Deutch, among others. It tells the story of a recently widowed husband forcing his uptight grandson to join him on an adventure to Florida during Spring Break. Despite its poor audience and critical reception, Dirty Grandpa performed quite well during its run in theatres during the early months of 2016.I won't be the first to say that Dirty Grandpa is bad. It's very bad in fact. There is tons wrong with this movie and its apparent right from the jump, the concept of a mismatched duo going on a road trip is a very tired plot, however, the least a movie of this nature can do is be funny and Dirty Grandpa can't even do that. Much of the humour relies on gross-out, raunchy jokes, that sadly do not work and are very played out. I did not need to see Robert De Niro jerking off, saying the n-word nor having sex, there was nothing funny about it other than he is a respected actor and an older gentleman, so ""ha-ha, that must be funny! Old people jerk off too"".If the road trip aspect wasn't enough of a cliché, the writer incorporates a marriage into the equation, with an old connection making their return into a character's life. Basically, Zac Efron's character is about to marry someone who is controlling but during his road trip with Robert De Niro runs into an old student of his and we all know where this plot point leads to even before it begins. It's a very tiresome story that begs the question of why this movie was even green lite in the first place, it features a pretty star-studded cast who can be pretty funny but the end result is just an unfunny, cliché ridden movie. Even Aubrey Plaza and Jason Mantzoukas who have been used in funny ways in other movies are reduced to caricatures who are loud and very one-note. It's extremely disappointing to see the cast wasted in this way, but I have seriously no clue why this was made or even rewritten considering how almost all of the jokes fell flat.Nothing about this movie was that good, it was loud, dumb and one of the most formulaic movies I have seen in quite sometime, however I can't deny that I didn't hate myself while watching it. The story moves at a very fast pace, that the 1 hour and 42-minute runtime did not feel long whatsoever. I was never bored or checked my phone during this movie, so despite it being so crudely made I must admit that I was entertained throughout. This does not mean that I enjoyed the film or can recommend however despite the horribleness this film oozes I'm glad it didn't make me want to peel my eyelids off, I am giving Dirty Grandpa a 2.5/10"
" Not funny!
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,1,It was just awful! It could be funny but unfortunately the plot was bad and also the actors
" It does what it says on the tin....
",2020-12-01 00:00:00,5,"Yikes, it's a coming of age film - for just about everyone concerned. Robert De Niro is an ageing gent who, having just lost his wife of 40-odd years - is intent on letting the badger loose. To that end, he recruits his rather straight-laced, soon to be wed, lawyer grandson ""Jason"" (Zac Efron) to drive him home. The journey proves anything but straightforward as they hit Daytona Beach on their road trip, meet a pair of lively girls and their gay pal and have some escapades that opens the young man's eyes to the aspirations of his grandad and, increasingly, of himself. De Niro has a bit of previous with this kind of role - though it's certainly more in your face than, say, ""Meet the Fockers"" (2004); the language isn't just a bit blue, it's fairly graphically explicit as he seeks sex with a perfectly willing girl Efron's age and at times it's actually quite poignant as he refuses to allow his age to consign him to the scrap heap. The humour is crass an a bit puerile, though - and the film really shows up the limitations of Efron as an actor. He is terribly wooden and never looks comfortable even when naked and high on drugs. The story tries, quite pitifully, to reconcile some more serious elements into the script - grandad is a Vet whose family don't know, is dysfunctional and that scenario is supposed to lend it some gravitas. Well, it doesn't. The ending is a twee, poor amalgamation of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" (1994) and ""Smokey and the Bandit"" (1977) that left me squirming in my chair. Both stars work well enough together, and fans of both/either will probably enjoy De Niro's refreshing frankness that epitomises that age is no barrier to having sex, and Efron - well he gets his ass out a few times. That's about it...."
" Rude. Hilarious
",2020-11-30 00:00:00,8,Was not expecting either Efron or Danny de Niro to be so rude but if it's teenage boy humour you want then this movie delivers
" There's no fool like an OlLD FOOL
",2020-11-25 00:00:00,1,"Ah, DeNiro...how your old carcass got talked into starring in this farce is beyond me. Foul language and profanities are launched multi-staged from this cinematic rocket pad, only to lift off, fly upwards only a few pathetic feet, and then topple backwards to blow up, showering the audience with...well, unlike Robert's character, I''ll refrain from being crude. Suffice it to say that Mr. DeNiro is much, no doubt, like this in real life---a nasty-mouthed, foolish old has-been not content until he embarrasses not only himself multiple times over, which he did, but also the Hollywood community at large, which he also did. This turgid mess of a 'movie' isn't redeemed one smidgen by Z.E., either.( I won't spell his name, so his future in film won't be torpedoed). Worst of all this, ah, 'film', for lack of a better choice of word, somehow aggravated my chronic intestinal issues, and it took several days of hot baths, crackers and bland foods to get right. But as the large intestine said to the small intestine, this, too, would pass...and so it did. Like the movie."
" Ups and Downs
",2020-11-09 00:00:00,10,"What's not to like about a bit of comedy? Well, I guess there were a couple of scenes that were a little cringy, the whole shopkeeper thing was a little odd, and for that very reason I wanted to rate this a bit lower.However, De Niro and Effron were great together, and I'm becoming a fan of Deutch who I hope to see a lot more of. I also found myself laughing out loud quite a few times which doesn't happen much in movies these days, so for me the score was rising.Lastly, checking out a few reviews here, as you do, and I see someone called this movie offensive. I find it so excruciatingly sad that so many people these days are void of humour and find offence in just about anything. So I couldn't possibly give this movie anything less than a big fat 10. Can I say fat?Advice: If you're one of us that still like a bit of silliness and enjoy a laugh then give it a go."
" Below average
",2020-11-05 00:00:00,2,"I really like how the African-American community has represented and a sacred Hindu symbol Swastika has been potrayed in a very discourteous way, overall this movie is jst like any other stereotypical Hollywood movie 2/10"
" Awesome Spring Break Movie!
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,10,Great movie for ordinary folks who still like 'dirty old man' movies. Nothing here is PC. It's dirty and crass and reminds me of the 'good le days' of my youth (older guy here). It's definitely one of the best movies of its type out there. I downloaded it a few months back and just watched it my 4th or 5th time. The jokes don't get old and there are some good social issues interweaved into the story that gives it a great ending. I won't give any spoilers. I'll just say to watch it and enjoy!
" ITS NOT PC
",2020-10-11 00:00:00,9,"I urge anyone who hasn't to watch the longer uncut version. It's dead funny. This film is not PC but it's not offensive either, it's vulgar, sarcastic silly. Zac Efron seems to have a talent for these movies, he does them well. Robert DeNiro seems to enjoy them too. That's why I think it's good. I get the feeling everyone involved was enjoying themselves while making it.I laughed for two hours solid.
Definitely worth watching"
" Good Friday night comedy
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,7,"Lots of great jokes in this. Found myself laughing pretty good throughout.
Someone says he encourages his grandson to cheat, which isn't true at all. They clearly weren't watching the same movie.
Some say it's offensive yet the main character (DeNiro) literally beats the crap out of people making fun of character for being gay and makes them apologize?
Very few dull moments. Worth a watch."
" funny but a little inconvenient but not disturbing (7.1)
",2020-09-16 00:00:00,7,"It's a pretty simple plot and the usual story, there's not much that makes this movie different but I still think it doesn't deserve this score.
I think it is too low than it should be. I frankly liked it, had a good time, had fun, and laughed. Especially grandpa(Robert De Niro) made me laugh so much.University environment, a beach I think you will enjoy it, of course, it's a simple movie but not bad. I think it's a little too inconvenient but not at an annoying level."
" Terrible
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,10,I have this film a 3 because it was frankly...dross. There were times when it threatened to be funny...but then it drove past the gags. It was too long and needed a good script editor. The jokes were childish and juvenile but I don't care about that if it makes me laugh.I upped my score to 10 after reading reviews saying it was insensitive to xy and z. Grow up. Who cares? It's supposed to be fun. Remember that? When ppl didn't get offended the sky was blue. This film wouldn't be made now. If you don't like it and are easily offended turn it off.
" Outrageous scenes that make no sense
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,3,"Never would I have thought to see De Niro do a film like Dirty Grandpa and here we are.Dirty Grandpa shows Jason Kelly take his grandpa on a trip to Florida and he soon learns that his grandpa isn't as clean as he thought.This film has humour that may offend tons of people. It's crass, gross and even shocking at times. It's crazy to think that someone as great as De Niro would do a film like this. Ultimately though, Robert De Niro is the best part of this film. Never has he been more vulgar and offensive but at times it does provide for some great jokes and his chemistry with Zac Efron is entertaining to watch. There are some moments which did get a laugh from but most of the jokes don't land since majority of them are so cheap. The story is something we've seen hundreds of times which makes it fairly predictable.What really annoyed me were some of the characters and the situations. Jason Mantzoukas as the drug dealer was so annoying. I hated how much screen time he got and everything that came out of his mouth wasn't funny. Adam Pally as Efron's cousin gave me the same feeling. Every time he was on screen, he was constantly irritating. Some of the situations De Niro and Efron get into would never happen in real life. It seemed like the script only added these situations for the sake of a joke but it just made the world of the film so unrealistic and stupid. Dirty Grandpa just feels like a collection of outrageous and shocking scenes that make no sense whatsoever.There isn't anything that makes this comedy special. It just tells you an abundance of cheap and dirty jokes. If you're looking for a film with an actual story that makes sense filled with characters you actually care about then Dirty Grandpa isn't for you."
" Can't stop laughing!
",2020-07-21 00:00:00,10,I've seen it 6 times now and I still can't stop laughing from start to finish! Perfectly cast and crude ridiculous humour that has those now easily offended laughing the night away. Excellent film!
" Doesn't deserve the hate
",2020-07-03 00:00:00,7,"Yes, it's crass and vulgar but it's actually funny. In this PC / Woke world people are obviously going to hate this movie because of many different -isms but if you choose not to be offended it's actually a funny romp with good performances from Zac and Bobby. Wouldn't it be a sad world if every movie was super PC and woke?"
" Funny,Funny,even Hilarious.
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,10,"One roller coaster of a film.Laugh a minute.It's the type of film you'll have to watch over and over to take in all the jokes,both spoken and visual. De Niro and Efron are on fine form. Danny Glover is his oh so fleeting appearance is fantastic. He asks his old 'Nam veteran buddy (De Niro) who Afron is: ""Who's the lesbian? Is he here to scissor with me?"" Honestly,you will piss yourself laughing at a lot of the scenes. I wont spoil it,but the photo slide scene towards the end will have you laughing out loud. BRILLIANT!!"
" Great movie
",2020-06-19 00:00:00,9,"I watched dirty grandpa like I had seen no other film, it was interesting everytime I watched again and it felt like i was watching it for the first time every time"
" Robert De Niro sells his soul for the cheapest of laughs
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,2,"How can the same guy who gave such legendary performances in some of the greatest films ever made find himself doing this? Has anyone in Hollywood cheapened their legacy more than Robert De Niro did when he took this role?The 'humour' is needlessly coarse and highly predictable. Pretty much every single gag in this movie has been done before (and a lot better). The level of acting from all corners is truly atrocious. Jason Mantzoukas was quite funny in The League but he really should have retired from acting after that as he is absolutely horrific in everything else. Zac Efron isn't the worst thing in this movie but he is terribly cast- he really doesn't work as a shy, humble prep boy. And as for De Niro? Well he could have been caught prostituting himself on a street corner and it would be less humiliating than this. Disastrous."
" What can you expect?
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,4,"Jason (Zac Efron) is about to get married. His grandmother has recently passed away and his grandpa Dick (Robert De Niro) is grieving but can't shake one of the last things she said to him; to go out and enjoy his life. After being emotionally blackmailed into going on a trip to Florida, Jason takes his grandpa in good faith to spend some quality family time but little does he know that all Dick wants to do is go on a rampant sex spree! Dan Mazer (I Give It A Year, Da Ali G Show) is the guy behind the camera calling all the shots here and he definately brings all the awkward gross out comedy of his prior work here while also bringing out a central double act in De Niro and Efron that is quite fun to watch at points. I thought Efron in particular is great in the moments where he smokes crack for the first time and has an epic party! De Niro is of course a legendary actor and much of the shock factor presented is the fact that you're seeing him say these unbelievably obscene things on screen and a certain image of him relaxing in a male fashion, shall we say, that will not leave the mind for some time! It is in pretty poor taste which isn't always a bad thing in comedy but it's main issue is it reminded me a lot of Mike & Dave Need Wedding Dates which was desperately unfunny and, although I did giggle a couple of times in this case, it does have a similarly uncomfortable air about it"
" Hilarious
",2020-03-22 00:00:00,7,"It's been years I haven't laughed so hard on a comedy movie. De Niro showed us once again why he is one of the best actors of all time. To all of you that only like the ""bad guy"" de Niro, you should skip this movie. For the real fans, it's a must watch!
Let alone the cliche of a ""romance"" ,this Movie was hilarious from the beginning throughout the end!"
" A disgrace to anyone who appreciates cinema.
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,1,"This was a god awful piece of cinematic garbage, and the fact that the Robert De Niro from Taxi driver/ Goodfellas decided to take up a role in this movie was an utter insult who appreciates the art of cinema."
" This film changed my life
",2020-02-27 00:00:00,9,"After 15 Budweisers one evening I decided to watch the $45 HD DVD of Dirty Grandpa I won from a lit-cigarette eating contest during the Sturgis Bike Rally last year. My god, what an incredible film! I could not believe my eyes-Robert De Niro is in this movie... as the titular Dirty Grandpa! Have you ever wanted to see Robert De Niro waddle onto a set, sigh deeply into the camera and tiredly demand the occupants of the room to ""shake them boobies""? I hope you have two hands to count every time this happens! Have you ever wanted to see Robert De Niro inhale a paint can of Jack Daniels while shouting racial epithets (confusingly) directed towards Zac Efron before he realizes that the cameras are rolling? This is your movie! Have you ever wanted to see Robert De Niro do slapstick comedy? You will struggle to hold it together as Robert De Niro refuses a stunt double, insisting on jumping a suspension bridge by himself on a snowmobile before botching it and toppling over like a wet sock full of batteries. And that is just in the first ten minutes! I got roughly halfway through the film before I fell asleep but when I woke up the remainder I saw was almost a literal repeat of the first 45 minutes, both of which I liked! I now watch this movie every two weeks to more or less repeal my entire nervous system when I run out of Tylenol 3s and I can't convince the local pharmacy to comp me for a ""fifteen week vacation."" If you can buy this movie for less than $30, don't! It deserves more of a commitment from you. That's why I purchase a DVD for every distant relative every Christmas so they know why they should remain distant."
" Everything you expect
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,6,Another raunchy Zac Efrom comedy? Nope a Robert De Niro raunchy comedy. This movie had some decent laughs.
" Baudy, fabulous, funny movie!
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,8,"I got this for my birthday from my eldest daughter, and boy does she have great taste!
From almost the start this is a raucous and raunchy ride in the filth train, every scene has some sexual innuendo and most have outright first filthy smut. It's fantastic!
Pretty much an ensemble cast too as they are all brilliant in their roles. I want to say that Aubrey Plaza stands out but she is on par with the others. Zoey Deutch is showing why she is one of the most desirable women, and Zac Efron showing that he does have acting chops and comedy is definitely his thing.
Bob...what can I say.
Watch it and love it!"
" Grandpa
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,6,"Oh , it was so funny and all of us need someone like his grandpa to remember us our way is wrong and we should stop it and live in the way we feel good"

" One of the BEST comedies made in resent times!!!
",2019-11-17 00:00:00,10,"Just super funny, the cast was awesome and when improve situations were raised, they knocked ot out of the park. Probably the funniest movie I have ever seen
De nero in!....Absolutely Deliciously Funny!"
" Dirty.
",2019-10-26 00:00:00,3,"As belying to its actors talents as it is sexist, racist, homophobic and just plain dumb, I benefited only from the prior knowledge of what I was walking into. The one slim hope that remains is that De Niro's paycheque was substantial enough to finance future projects, ones that the crew of ""Dirty Grandpa"" might witness and be indoctrinated by the competencies of better filmmakers."
" Hilarious!!
",2019-09-29 00:00:00,8,"Very funny, crude movie! Efron has successfully moved away from his clean High School Musical character and shown how funny he can be. Di Niro's best comedy too."
" Funny insane FUNNY !
",2019-09-07 00:00:00,10,I was allmost pissing my pants when i saw this movie the first time ... seen it like 20 times more .. and i JUST love de nero in this movie ... its insane that a 76 old actor can out class and out do everyone that even try to get close ... the other actors in this movie really trys there best ... thx ROBERT ur a GOD of movies in my eyes

" What a waste of my time and of a great cast!
",2019-08-24 00:00:00,1,"I couldn't watch the whole thing. Horrible. No problem with dirty jokes, but those were too much, and not even funny! Man, I feel sorry for De Niro."
" What a waste of time and money.
",2019-08-12 00:00:00,1,"This is the second Zac Efron film I have seen this week on Netflix and I cannot believe he can lower himself to do such crap. What are Zac Efron and Robert DeNiro trying to prove? It's obvious by the box office how much people avoided going to see this. The director and writer made a hopeless, revolting, bad language film. If I has started counting the abusive language from the beginning in this I am sure it would total over many hundred words.Come on Zac, you are so much more capable of this, in THE LUCKY ONE you gave a wonderful performance and also in HAIRSPRAY, and THE TED BUNDY movie, but man don't destroy your career with the other crap you are doing.If this review makes it to the public I will be surprised."
" Not fantastic or even good. But better then you would expect.
",2019-08-07 00:00:00,3,"This movie had me laughing out loud a couple of times, perhaps 3 or 4 times. Robert De Niro and Zac Efron are both great in this and great together also.
Zac Efron plays this successful but uptight guy, that's having to hang out with his dirty and somewhat crazy grandfather, it's a fun idea for a comedy. Many can relate in some way and it's always fun when old people act out with no inhibitions for some reason.
But this movie sadley became ridicules as it went along and followed the exact same formula many other american movies of this type done before, which to me, made it so much more uninteresting and just silly and predicatble. Which was a shame also, when you have a talant like Robert De Niro it could have been more adventures to have a deeper script but still with the element of comedy there. Could have been great. Now it's just passible. Still not as bad as you would expect. (assuming your like me and don't expect that much from these type of movies)."
" Dirty Grandpa

" A film for young guns

" Painfully bad
",2019-03-18 00:00:00,3,"First things first: I did not finish watching this movie. After about 40 minutes I had enough. Right from the start it is toecurling unfunny. It desperatly tries to be incorrect, shocking and funny but close to never is. Somehow it feels like watching a way to long stretched sketch played by your unfunny friends or amateur comedians on a failing wedding party. You know the embarrising feeling, right? This movie is horrible, a failure. Period."
" I Gave It A 1. -0- wasn't an option.
",2019-03-04 00:00:00,1,"Absolutely the worst movie I have ever sat through. And it was a precursor to DeNiro going off the rails. The guy needs to hang it up. And leave the politics as well. DeNiro WAS at one time pretty picky in what roles he took. Someone must have pictures of him in some compromising situation or he owes money and is doing a ""Go Fund Me In Crap Movies"".
Seriously, I see some reviews her that say a lot about the ""humor"" some people possess. A few gave it above average scores. Not many though. I'll never see another DeNiro movie. Ever."
" a dirty American family comedy

" So bad, it's good
",2019-02-16 00:00:00,5,"I watched this when I was super high. I don't think I've ever laughed harder at a film. Twice I had to leave the room and I was literally crying throughout 90% of it. It is such an absurd, atrocious excuse for a movie that you have to laugh at whoever was behind it. Great experience"

have a thing for raunch geriatrics and DeNiro finds Aubrey Plaza. And Efron
finds an old college contemporary who knew him when he was into art and
photography with Zoey Deutch.The two get into quite a number of scrapes and DeNiro has some moves that
Efron couldn't conceive that grandpa had. DeNiro was mostly a career army
man and did some classified service at the time for Uncle Sam.I might have enjoyed this more, but I really have to resent having a drug dealer
and a serious one at that as a comic character. Nothing funny about the product Jason Mantzoukas sells and it ain't just some good weed. Wrong message going out there.Still the romping DeNiro and Efron do is fun to watch."
" Forget the reviews and you'll definitely enjoy it.
",2019-01-22 00:00:00,6,"Forget the reviews and watch it. This movie will give you lots of big laughs and is a fun pass-time. From the title it is clear that it doesn't intent to convey any sophisticated messages, and yes it will be cliche and predictable. But that's all it was meant to be. Something to make you laugh when you watch it together with friends on a Friday night, while having ice cold bear and snacks. Robert De Niro is hilarious. Unfortunately he is the only brilliant part of the film, but he still manages to save it in the end. The movie's is verbally bold and uncompromising which makes it enjoyable. It certainly does not offer any rich cinematic techniques and bring you enlightenment. I mean, did you expect Zack Efron to deliver a memorable performance or the rest of the cast? Take this movie for what it is. It's a tasty snack, thanks to De Niro. It was meant to be that and does not fail to deliver."
" Seriously unfunny!
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,1,"This is probably the worst film I have seen in a while. I think Zac Efron and Robert De Niro are good actors so I don't know why they chose to star in this awful film. There was no chemistry between the actors and I think my children could write a better script, it just wasn't funny at all. Aubrey Plaza is not a good actress in my opinion and her character Lenore was revolting. The film was just gross from start to finish with a stupid, unbelievable ending!"
" You talkin' to me?
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,3,"Robert De Niro must have been in some serious debt for taking this role. Definitely the lowpoint of his career.There is nothing funny in the movie, all the humor it's trying to pull off are gross/shocking scenes. The kinds that 5 year old kids laugh at until they outgrow it (probably by the age of 10)."
" Bizarre and not original
",2019-01-04 00:00:00,3,"They try to be funny in this movie only with obscene scenes. But the problem is that scenes are too silly and not funny. Also, the story has nothing original."
" A Rip Off of a Not So Great Movie Either
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,6,"The first time I watched this movie, it was bad. Even the charisma of Zoey Deutch and Robert De Niro can't help the mediocracy breathing through each vain of the movie. The ending was so ""straight to video"" level, I can't help but to wonder ""Why can a movie like this get produced into a full lengthed feature film?""Then after, I happened to rewatch an 80's movie ""Who's That Girl"" starring Madonna and suddenly it strucked me: ""Dirty Grandpa is a rip off of Who's That Girl"". At first I didn't want to call it a ""rip off"", I would prefer ""a reference"" or ""a homage"" but Google did not back me up with any evidence connecting the two.So both of them have different stories but the same elements. Both of them are about marriages, the two stories are about a man doing errands before his big day. The difference here is that in Dirty Grandpa, the main character picks up his Grandpa, in Who's That Girl, the main character picks up a mysterious woman. Both the grandpa and the woman have ""crazy"" characters. Both the main character are laywers but want to be something else. Both marriages are canceled in the end of the story. Both main characters get attached to another girl. The Bride in both stories are annoying.If I have to choose wich is better, I would choose Who's that Girl. At lease that movie made me have several rewatches when I was little. Even now I think Who's That Girl is backed up with a more grown up script.So the mystery is solved. If you are wondering ""Who the hell gave an Idea to a such frivolous movie"" you have an answer. It's a rip off of a not so great movie from the past"

The humor is so low, it feels like something out of 1950. The dumbest ""girls are hot and crazy, this generation is full of pussies, gays are dumb, haha I punched you in the dick, the war was cool"" type of trash. Some people seem to have thought this is still funny but this feels like it was written by an old sour man born in the 50s. Terrible movie."

" Meet the grandpa
",2018-06-13 00:00:00,3,"With a title like Dirty Grandpa, you can fathom this is a crude, low brow comedy. It wants to shock you and beat you with a serious message of having fun because life is short. The trouble is it is not funny with a rather generic and forgettable plot. A lot of the crude comedy has been done before in those Hangover films and its rip offs.Jason (Zac Efron) is a bland corporate lawyer engaged to hectoring Meredith (Julianne Hough) who is even more boring. When Jason's grandma dies, he gives his grandfather Dick (Robert De Niro) a ride to Florida after the funeral. Dick is foul mouthed and on the lookout to have sex so soon after his wife has died. His crude behaviour shocks Jason who catches his grandpa jerking off to porn. Dick meanwhile is appalled with his straightlaced grandson who is following in his father's footsteps. Dick thinks he is getting married to someone unsuitable. He should be having fun, deep down he thinks his grandson is a free spirit. Dick wants to have fun after 40 years of marriage and life is short for him.Jason encounters Shadia (Zoey Deutch) an old college friend who he finds a genuine affection for, when he is not getting into scrapes and scraps with his grandpa who himself is romancing the much younger Lenore (Aubrey Plaza.)To my kids, Robert De Niro is the guy from those 'Meet the Parents' series of comedies. When I was younger De Niro was the guy from Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The Deer Hunter, The Godfather II. We would debate whether he was the greatest actor in the world.Dirty Grandpa just shows that Hollywood doesn't know what to do with old great actors like De Niro and Pacino who seemed to have been reduced to making embarrassing comedies. Maybe Sean Connery and Gene Hackman had the right idea by just walking away from the industry."
" Hilarious
",2018-06-06 00:00:00,8,Absolutely hilarious. I have never laughed so hard! Aubrey Plaza to be amazing in Dirty Grampa. De Niro was also spectacular. He must have loved doing this film as he has some amazing lines! There are some continuity issues but they can be forgiven as its a comedy and who cares! When you need a good laugh watch Dirty Grampa!

" Not The Best Raunchy Comedy
",2018-04-23 00:00:00,4,"I saw this film because I have enjoyed Zach Efron in Comedies in the past and I'm a big fan of Robert De Niro. Unfortunately it ended up being just as blah as I figured it would from the trailers. I found myself checking out of this film periodically because it was just another film that had been done for with a slight alteration. We've seen this kind of movie time and time before and I guess the writers thought ""What I'd we add a Grandfather to the story?"" And then bam, you've got Dirty Grandpa."
" What language is this in?
",2018-04-21 00:00:00,2,"I thought it was English, but, after watching 20 minuites (a loose term), I'm pretty sure, it's written in Toiletish. Honestly, I couldn't understand half the stuff they're talking about. Abbreviations and terms that have no meaning. No meaning. Just like this film. What an embarrassment to Zach Efron and Robert De Niro's career."
" Good shock value, poor story
",2018-04-05 00:00:00,5,"The story makes little sense other than create an excuse to expose sexual behaviors and stiff bodies. And know the mob is in control in Florida. Somewhat amusing, somewhat shocking, somewhat excessive."
" The fall of a titan
",2018-04-01 00:00:00,3,"""Dirty Grandpa"" is just another modern attempt at a crude and raunchy humor thrown in a cesspool of R-rated comedies. It's a niche that sells tickets by the ton due to the gigantic stars attached to the films and by making the audience try to let of steam from a hard day's work with vulgarity and crude sexual humor. That's my two cents on the contemporary comedy film and make no mistake, ""Dirty Grandpa"" gets every box ticked from the checklist above.
There are established stars that work out greatly in raunchy comedies and then there are serious actors who do not fit in that environment.The film centers on a young lawyer, player by Zac Efron, who is about to get married it two weeks. Unfortunately, his grandmother passes away leaving his grandfather, Robert De Niro, a war veteran, shattered into pieces. He tries to console his grandfather and is deceived into going on a spring break road trip, hoping to find his youthful self again. 
The script has no quality to it, just another spring break type of story with many disturbing scenes involving De Niro, especially his character's awkward relationship with Aubrey Plaza's character.I idolized Robert De Niro for many decades, from ""Mean Streets"" to ""Casino"", he was the embodiment of the gangster persona. His performances left you chills long after the movie ended. Since the 00's he has been doing mostly light comedies or family friendly movies. 
Now, with seeing the vast majority of De Niro's filmography, I have to say that ""Dirty Grandpa"" is definitely one of the lowest, if not the lowest point of his career. This is not due to his performance, but to the fact that he agreed to take on this role and embarrass the guy that once put raw energy into his characters. The film really left me in an unpleasant mood, a bit shook up on how an idol fell to the common rows.""Dirty Grandpa"" is a childish film that will make you never look the same way again at Robert De Niro. One of the most disappointing cinematic experiences I have ever had!"
" Horrible

Straight laced Jason discovers his Grandpa has a few vices along the way as circumstances takes them to Daytona during Spring Break with an old college friend (Zoey Deutch) and her girlfriend (Aubrey Plaza) who has the hots for Grandpa.The film digresses from a unique crudely hilarious film into a Hollywood formula romance as the humor tapers off with stale gags. Aubrey Plaza was better than Viagra in her role. The film makes fun off societal norms in favor of the drug filled, save the planet and party bunch...but then that is to be expected. Funnier than most teen sex comedies minus all the gratuitous nudity.Guide: Plenty of swearing. Brief sex. Very brief nudity."

",2018-02-04 00:00:00,6,"That it had immature sexual humor & language and that DeNiro wasted his time playing a dirty grandpa. Yes, that is how completely moronic the PC crowd has become. check out bobthemoronman if you don't believe me.
As for the film, it is meh. It does have immature sexual humor & DeNiro did waste his time, but that I expected going in and makes the upper limit on the film a 7 probably. The good parts: Aubrey Plaza & the guy playing the drug dealer, John Msomething. I thought Aubrey was hilarious in the first half-dozen or more episodes of P&R that she was in. Eventually, her character became obnoxious & annoying just for the sake of being obnoxious & annoying. In this, Aubrey is slutty just for the sake of being slutty & there is nothing wrong with that; She is hilarious, from beginning to end & esp at the end. 
Add to bucket list: I wish to die while eating out Aubrey Plaza's pussy.As for the PC crowd? Get stuffed."

" Hilarious Comedy!
",2018-01-28 00:00:00,6,"Robert De Niro and Zac Efron star in this 2016 comedy.
De Niro (Meet the Parents) plays Dick Kelly, a recent widower who 
goes on vacation with his uptight, grandson, Jason (Effron). Jason
discovers that his grandpa has a wild side to him and things turn
crazy for them along the way. Dermot Mulroney and Julianne Hough 
also appear. This is a hilarious film and De Niro is great as usual.
I recommend this."
" No denying De Niro
",2017-12-30 00:00:00,5,"Dirty Grandpa's redeemed by De Niro; he's such an expressive actor, and this film touches on an important topic: prejudice against the elderly; bravo for tackling an important topic (whether it was intentional or not). I just didn't find Dirty Grandpa funny; Borat: that movie was funny; laugh wize Borat or The Dictator craps on Dirty Grandpa."
" Can you give a zero star? - Because this one needs it.
",2017-12-29 00:00:00,1,"This film was so painful to watch. Nothing new here, it's just a spring break movie with Grandpa as one of the college kids. De Niro and Efron must have read some other script to even have been on board. The supporting cast delivered their lines horribly. The characters of Tan Pam and Cousin Nick lacked any formal education in acting. The 2 cops in the film watched Superbad and thought they could be Bill & Seth - not even close. Maybe it was the script or possibly the direction, but I felt the film lacked any funny material."
" F as in F word funny
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,9,"I'm honestly sick and tired of the special snowflakes crying out because of the supposedly insensisitve and oh look how it's demeaning to gays or whatever. It's freaking humor, you retarded idiots. It's supposed to be funny, I don't care what part of your special feelings aren't safe. Cinema is a place of make and make feelings. Don't you like it? OK, don't watch it. Do you go with the family to an R-rated film? And expect it to be family-friendly? Go die. In a wildfire. With them. I want my movies to ENTERTAIN, not to plead allegiance to feminazi and YES I am a part of reality, the reality of their so- called rape-culture patriarchal manure make-up- words. It's called real life. In real life you don't have safe spaces. In real life, you get hurt by words only if you haven't been punched in the mouth. Well, I've been punch in the mouth enough to know words DO NOT HURT. It's a nice movie with funny references, I'm enjoying it and a lot of my female friends did. 10/10 for being an entertaining value, and not condoning to lunatic sensitivity-land. KUDOS to the writer and actors."
" Whom was their targeted audience?
",2017-09-07 00:00:00,3,"This movie is terrible from the beginning to the end. It fails in direction, script, it is not at all funny. They went for a somewhat of sexual and black humor, which neither really succeeded. It felt like I heard all the jokes and I've seen all of the scenes already, even thou it was the first time watching it. As I've summarized, I don't understand whom they targeted to watch their movie? It can't be the under 16 population due to the type of humor, it can't be serious adults, and I highly doubt any teenager, student or anyone with basic intelligence could like this bunch of scenes. But it doesn't surprise me, modern cinematography created much worse things than this, pop culture is ruining more than just the movies. What surprises me is that Robert De Niro actually starred in this movie. I really admired his work especially as The Godfather is my ultimate #1. But lately his movie choices are quite questionable.To conclude, you probably already know if it is worth watching it. I would definitely suggest not to waste your time, but there always is someone that like the movie no matter how bad it might be. I knew what I was up for before I've started watched it, and I knew what my review will look like. But still, I gave it a shot, part of being bored and part of having lack of good movies to watch, however if you are in the similar situation, don't do as I did, try to catch some other movie or whatever else you can think of."
" Hilarious!
",2017-08-22 00:00:00,9,"I have a hard time finding movies these days that keep my attention all the way through and keep me laughing, but this one did just that. I suppose it appeals to those with a certain sick sense of humor. If you're someone like my mother who doesn't see the humor in pooping and farting and penis jokes, etc., you won't like this. But if you're the opposite, there will be times you'll laugh so hard you cry!"
" Vulgar humor that mature audiences can get a kick out of on chemistry alone.
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,8,"Dirty Grandpa is in no way a super unique expertly crafted academy award worthy film, if you're going into it with expectations that high because De Niro is in it, put on the brakes this film is *not* for you. If you are sensitive to vulgar, filthy language you're not going to like it one bit. Which I believe is why critics have been incredibly harsh in their reviews of this film. Honestly, most films that end up rated low by a critic I feel completely opposite of after my own viewing. The chemistry between Zac Efron and Robert De Niro makes it worth a watch alone. If you can't handle seeing De Niro curse like a sailor and be insanely inappropriate and different than the types of roles he is most known for, again this film is not for you. I've seen this movie several times and though some of the vulgarity can be somewhat cringe-worthy at times, it's still hilarious. Sometimes when movie dialogue makes you squirm you know you're really feeling the full escape most people are hoping to slip into as a break from the oft too serious real world, and you feel the full on blast of a ridiculous raunchy comedy. For a De Niro you've yet to see on screen behaving like a bawdy horny teenager after being married for some 40-years as Dick Kelly. Zac Efron as Jason Kelly the vanilla, straight laced type, about to jump into a life everyone else has dictated for him as he settles in like an old man who does the same boring thing each day, eats dinner at 4pm and is in bed by 8pm yet is probably still in the prime of his 20s. Fans of Aubrey Plaza rejoice! She's on point as the slutty college gal Lenore, yin to Dr Niro's yang, and equally as foul mouthed and inappropriate. It's a fun film if you're not too prudish have a well deserved, even though somewhat awkward laugh!"
" Hilarious!
",2017-08-01 00:00:00,10,"I really REALLY didn't want to like this film. I was coxed into watching it with a friend, I read the summary prior to watching and the whole story line seemed outrageous and totally not my thing but I went along with it anyway. Now whilst the story line certainly is outrageous i found myself laughing start to finish - its certainly NSFW and i wouldn't want to watch it with any of my relatives as it was quite crude in places, but if you take it for what it is, it's hilarious. 100% would happily watch again."
" Very corny, indeed!
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,7,"This is one of the best adult comedies I enjoyed. Come on, I thought DeNiro was so hilarious.

His soundtrack is so nice- it makes me Hold on, Hold on, Hold on..."
" Hey this made me laugh
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,7,"Now I had nothing to do with this film but I am defending it because it set out to make you laugh and I did. If you have a problem with ""Frat Boy Humor"" then you won't like this. Stick to PG movies.Most of the time I agree with critics but this time they are 100% wrong. What critics seem to forget is this ""What is the story"" ""What is the category"" ""Does the film accomplish what it set out to do""? Well to me it is ""Yes"" to all the above. Now the film is not realistic but even reality shows are not real. In this film Zac Efron is taking his grandpa to Florida so his grandpa can see an old friend. Along the way the experience ""Spring Break"". So in reality this film is a road movie but the film is a comedy and the film has many LOL scenes. Give this film a chance. This is not ""High School Musical"" so keep the kids away from this."
" De Niro still rocks
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,7,Normally don't have patience for crude comedy but had to check it out as a Robert DeNiro fan. Definitely didn't disappoint (even with crudeness). Had plenty of laughs and plenty of insensitive crudeness to cover every area that would offend folks BUT it's advertised as this so only view if you can accept it for what it is! Maybe if viewers did a better job researching/listening to the advertisements they wouldn't be disappointed or expecting more than what's intended (sighing).Great job of acting by all and even has a moral to the story for most!
" Much better than expected
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,7,"Jason Kelly is a young, upwardly-mobile lawyer at a law firm in Atlanta. His grandmother has just died and his grandfather, Dick Kelly, needs someone to drive him to Florida. Little does he know that Dick really just wants to go to Spring Break in Daytona...From the promos this looked pretty juvenile. It is, sort of, but works. The main reason that it does so is Robert De Niro as Dick. He gets the best lines, particularly some great put-downs and banter, and delivers them perfectly. What's more, the humour isn't all of the puerile variety and there are some clever punch-lines and scenes along the way. Quite subversive at times too.Plot is pretty basic and predictable but it's not bad. Overall, well worth watching, unless you're someone who is easily offended and/or has no sense of humour."
" Mediocre Rated R raunchy comedy with Robert Deniro
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,6,"There has been a rise of adult / rated R comedies which some gems like 21&22 Jump Street, Neighbors 1&2. Dirty Grandpa falls under the less inspired of the raunchy Rated R comedies. The only saving grace (or at least the question you ask yourself throughout the film) is how and why is Robert Deniro in this film? Deniro has been in everything including the Focker movies and Machete so I guess this kind of made sense... have a drug induced, overly sex, non-PC movie. The story itself is pretty much uptight lawyer who's getting married (played by Zach Effron) needs to take his grieving grandpa home and almost immediately his grandpa wants to ""bang"" everything in sight. This leads drugs, sex, and super awkward situations and mixed in with a lot of crude jokes and very crude jokes that hits almost everything from mild racism, homophobia, and plenty of dick jokes.I found the movie amusing enough to finish, it's definitely a forgettable comedy."
" Raunchy, but stops just short of being gross
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,8,"I had several laugh out loud moments. Aubrey Plaza was particularly amusing. If a viewer is uptight, I can see how the raunchiness would turn him off. The viewer whose sensibilities are no so delicate may find it enjoyable. There was a freshness in the raunchiness that made the movie very entertaining."
" Dumb but hilarious
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,6,"Lots of people trashing this film. It's dumb as hell, entirely predictable, but incredibly funny. De Niro, is on fire, holding it all together with some of the funniest put downs I've heard in a long time. Zak Efron is the straight man, literally, and works well as a foil for De Niro's wit and timing. If , anything, I'm wondering if there was an even grosser version left in the edit room. Lots of gratuitous drug references that spin the old moral compass around, and a bit of an odd fit, so park your brain for a while and enjoy the ride, it's not a significant film, but it moves along nicely for a running time of almost 2 hrs. It's a credit to De Niro that he can take on this kind of role and make something of it."

After the funeral of his wife, he insists that he and Jason drive him from Atlanta to Boca Raton, and that it be the very next day, since that's the day he and his late wife always went to Boca. Naturally Grandpa is out of control now that he's single for the first time in four decades, grief being no barrier to going on a hunt. Jason ends up partying at Daytona Beach for Spring Break where he also meets with another woman.What eventually occurs in Dirty Grandpa are a slur of outrageous gags and sex/homophobic jokes, and many jokes that are far over the top intended to offend and shock it's viewers. I think that the film has succeeded in that sense, and there has been a majority of critics reviews and common fans alike which sound rather offended by this film. There are a few funny moments and some laughs but things are still very predictable and not as enjoying as this film should have been. One can see why this film has already seemingly been forgotten. As a rewatch 06/30/19' opinions remain same, Dirty Grandpa isn't that funny and much of the comedy is forced, with a predictable result."
" Just not funny
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,1,"This movie is just plain awful.It has tired old jokes, a plot that has been used so many times that you can tell how it will end as soon as you begin to watch it and a conflict that would not be a conflict in any world with sane people.It seems like one of those movies where the main actors got an A role and had to play in this B role because it was in their contract. I don't care about the crude humor or anything the other people were complaining about because I assumed it would be that sort of movie before I even watched it.I honestly have no idea why anybody rated this more than 1 star but I did not laugh once when watching this movie and I was with friends and we had been drinking even..."
" so funny
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,10,"This movie is so good I was laughing so hard. You might think it is just like any other American comedy movie. Well, it might be, but it is really unexpected. At least to me. I've never seen Robert Deniro playing that role. I think its just hilarious. I was laughing from the very beginning of the movie. I totally recommend it to everybody. I have to say I'm not a huge fan of Zac Efron, but he did good here, I always see him as the High School Musical Star. He is been doing good stuff lately. Best movie for a Friday Night. I think I'm going to watch it again right now, lol PS I don't know why I have to write at least 10 lines to be able to post a review. This is just meant to say what you think about the movie, not to write a novel about it. I guess I have just a few words left to write. Watch it, you won't regret it"
" Really unwatchable mess
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,1,"Mr De Niro continues to flush those glorious days of Goodfellas and Raging Bull down the toilet with this...quite possibly the most unwatchable comedy ever made which is a reason why I won't take long with this stinker.There's all sorts of jokes for all the family, sex jokes, toilet jokes, fart jokes, molestation jokes, rape jokes, homophobic jokes.Oooh, fun for all the family.Meanwhile I'm sat here wondering, why the hell is Robert De Niro in this? Surely he should have learned by now and same goes to Zac Efron too.Even a drink won't get you pass this one, trust me."
