" A wonderful and memorable story with its implementations. Hooked right away.
",2021-04-10 00:00:00,8,"I didn't know anything about the movie when by chance I started watching it in the middle. Of course, it wasn't like a maximum of 15 minutes, basically immediately hooked.And then I finished looking at it quite impressed. The surprise was great when I realized Angelina Jolie was the director. Of the actors, only Jai Courtney knew in advance, but not necessarily well-known stars make the film good, here it was noticed.Great movie until the end and still remained in the thoughts afterwards. Nevertheless, only 8 stars when not 9 or 10 can be too hefty to give. Sure, I had to think about 8-9 for a while."
" Great movie
",2021-03-18 00:00:00,9,Movie was very good acting outclass.the scene where every prisoners punch is so terrifying.
" Not good
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,1,The flaws are ubiquitous and egregious. Sad state of affairs during the pandemic that we reach for anything and this is simply a waste of your time; bereft of anything good to say.Wash dishes or clothes or vacuuming is more beneficial (well always a good plan).Have a nice day.
" Great movie but read the book
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,8,Incredible story and beautifully done by Angelina Jolie but you owe it to yourself to read the book. Amazing. The book brought me to the movie. What an amazing story! What a life this man led! üíù
" Very good movie
",2021-02-03 00:00:00,10,Yeah this movie is pretty good I highly recommend it
" Slow story telling
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,7,"I would rate this movie a 9 or even a 10 but , the story telling is just so slow if this movie was 90-100 it would be AMAZING, idk about you"
" Meh
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,6,"I expected a better movie. It is not bad, and have I had the possibility, I would have rated it 6.7/10. It just does not deserve a full 7/10 in my opinion.The movie just never got me, no emotion, and way too black and white, almost theatrical."
" Inspiring Movie!
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,5,"Based on a true story :
Louis Zamperini often found himself in trouble as a child, but he turned his life around with the help of his older brother and channeled his strength into running, later qualifying for the 1936 OlympicsLouie enlists in the army when World War breaks out. He survives an unimaginable 47 days stranded on a raft after his plane crashes in the Pacific before he is seized by the Japanese navy. After being sent to a POW camp, Louie becomes an extremely brutal prison commander's ideal victim. The movie will tug at your heartstrings and will inspire the viewer through the touching story of Louis Zamperini."
" Could've been awesome
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,5,"Whilst the concept and the the acting of jack o'Connell were promising (and jack didn't let us down) I think the antagonist was a caricature and overacted so much that it brought me out of the story. The whole film felt cheap and poorly put together which was a shame but shows the director needs more practice. I didn't enjoy this, it didn't pull me"
" Unbroken
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,6,"True story of Louis Zamperini, an Olympic runner who, during WWII was stranded at sea for 6 weeks when his plane crashed and was rescued and imprisoned in Japanese POW camps for the rest of the war and endured terrible cruelties.Quite an epic, covering a considerable amount - olympics, flying, adrift at sea and in the camps, which makes up the bulk of story. All done most thoughtfully and, despite his heroism, it is largely free of derring-do, thanks to the solid direction by Jolie and a wonderfully controlled, understated but moving portrayal by Jack O'Connell. Of particular note are the scenes between Zamperini and his camp commander and later notorious war criminal played by Miyavi, which are often unbearably tense."
" Unbroken
",2021-01-12 00:00:00,9,"Okay, I've read Hilenbrand's book, which is simply riveting. Louis Zamperini's story is almost unbelievable and the movie cannot possibly do it justice in just over two hours. This could easily have stretched to four hours, but today's cinema-going public haven't got that kind of patience. The film is well done and I was certainly thoroughly entertained by it, knowing in advance it would never be as good as the book, but it certainly didn't leave me cold, demanding my ticket price back. Just watch this for the good movie that it is. Yes it could have been better, but it's a very good attempt by Jolie at the book. I just cannot understand why so many people have given it bad reviews. IMDb puzzles me greatly at times, especially when some awful movies get glowing reviews. Is there some sinister network of people out to sabotage certain movies? I really don't know. This is a very decent movie and Jolie should be proud of it."
" A really good WW2 movie
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,8,"I just watched the movie and I think it's another really good WW2 movie. It shows us that all that is needed to survive is loyalty and courage. In my opinion all these violent scenes are necessary, since they make us realise what the previous generations went through, which we should all bear in mind, so as to appreciate what we have. Louie is a higlhy influencial character who teaches us that we should never give up no matter what we may come up against."
" Appalling
",2020-12-25 00:00:00,1,"This is a truly abysmal film. There is no plot to speak of - presumably the well-worn theme of ""plucky Americans show those pesky Japs who is the boss"" was considered sufficient. Mind-numbingly boring passages alternate with scenes of appalling brutality and cruelty perpetrated, needless to say, by the Yellow Peril. Jack O'Connell's talents are wasted on this meretricious rubbish. It is a vile and immoral film which should never have been made."
" Watch The Railway Man instead
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,5,This is a vastly overblown film which concentrates far too long on the subjects time on the open seas and his brutal treatment in a prisoner of war camp.Clearly his later life was of too much significance to be covered by title cards at the end
" Good idea, but cheap plastic screenplay
",2020-12-18 00:00:00,2,"Despite of my deep respect to real heroues behind the real story, and good intentions of many involved, this movie is one of worst plastic, cheap screenplays ever. It is empty, lacks that bitter taste in your mouth, just before you squeze a tear, as this movie simply has no soul. Sorry.
Most of action scenes are polished, men have grease in their hair even after 45 days in small boat. Thir facial hair does not grow, their faces are fresh and shiny shaven every day, and after a month in a boat in the middle of the ocean their tan is lightly red, just as they were attending 8 hours shift on field, not a 30 days struggling battle for life.
Through all the film actors faces are unreal, plastic, they show no emotions, you simply do not simpathize with them, so you do not feel the pain, which was intent to be shown. Bad acting, not skilled actors.
I do not miss known actors here, but rather some involvment in the movie. I miss the crew convincing me they are really in life denger, or when flying that fortress, it looks more like a cheap video game than a real thing. I do not feel being with them there in the sky, becasue they did not create such feelings for me.
I rated 2 due to respect of all staff behind the scenes, and for good intentions. Othervise I would rate less."
" Wow
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,10,I am in schock ! People can be so evil....... So sad......
" Worth the Watch
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,8,"So I was sceptical within the first 30 minutes of watching the film, as it seemed like it was going to be another 'drag it out as long as possible' type. However, I was pleasantly surprised that it turned out not to be that kind of movie at all!The first hour can be a bit 'slow' for most viewers, however, I believe this first hour sets the scene wonderfully for the 'main body' of the movie, the POW camp.
The camaraderie that is encapsulated in this film is done brilliantly! You get a real sense that these POW truly are on the same team and they're all fighting for their own survival, but as a group.
The way that the movie reached the ending could have done with a bit more explaining to it.I am by no means, an expert at writing reviews and nor will I ever be. But I wanted to leave my little piece of how I enjoyed this movie and I was no disappointed by it in the slightest."
" Very Good
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,7,"First off, I have read the book by Laura Hillenbrand (an outstanding author). This film is very good and does it justice. Kudos to Angelina Jolie (director) and the Coen Brothers (co-writers). Also Roger Deakins (cinematographer), plus Jack O'Connell and Domnhall Gleason (actors). There is something about a story so strong and well written it is a nearly impossible task to match it in a 2 hour film. With this in mind, I rate this 7 stars. Personally, I would have preferred a straight documentary. I read ""Seabiscuit"", which Ms. Hillenbrand previously wrote. It was also made into a film. The main difference being it was presented in a dramatic form, but with a documentary monologue by the excellent orator David McCullough. Both are excellent reads. Personally, I prefer ""Seabiscuit""; it is a better film. However, both films are well worth watching."
" This could've been so much better
",2020-11-12 00:00:00,8,"I have the feeling that I'm only giving it an 8 because I am emotional and with good imagination so I may have filled some gaps here and there. But with the gravity of Zamperini's story, this movie could've been so much more impactful. With such story as his, the audience should be crying half the time. I would. But I didn't. Not even once. And that's a waste."
" Showing other side of the war
",2020-10-08 00:00:00,8,"Having watched many war movies, this had definitely moved me from within.
It always showed hope and when it ended, I was literally crying as well filled with positive energy.
A must watch for people who love war movies and want to see what actually happens in a POW camp!"
" The worst movie ever
",2020-09-16 00:00:00,1,"This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen. Everything is so forced, it is trying way too hard to be an inspirational movie, the actors are so flat. It is utterly pointless, what a waste of time and energy. This makes my faith in humanity drop even more. Angelina Jolie should stick to acting. I wish I could have 2 hours of my life back. I can't for the life of me comprehend how they spend so much time and money on crap like this."
" Fantastic movie A must watch
",2020-09-14 00:00:00,9,"Really very nice movie
If you are war movie fan or like true story based movies definitely this movie is for you."
" If u can take it, u can make it.
",2020-09-14 00:00:00,8,"Unbroken is a journey of a man through tough times. Brillantly shot and written.
The life of Louis Zamperini is Inspiring,motivating,incentivizing. A moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory. The scene where so called Bird force Louis to lift the big piece of wood over his head, his fight with the nature when he was struggling in the sea, his commitment towards his beliefs, his patience as a prisoner, his sacrifice towards fellow prisoners , His confidence level, inner strengths and many others. Must watch"
" Decent start and then just looses the plot
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,4,Starts off quite well and has a nice build up. After few days on the raft the movie looses the plot completely... No story... Just a drag
" Waste of a great story.
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,2,"A truly great story was processed by Jolie who turned the great story into a cringe fest that I had to turn off out of frustration for what might have been. The actors were selected on their looks and should never be allowed to ""act"" again. Shame on you Jolie, are you really that out of touch with reality?"
" Mediocre at best
",2020-09-10 00:00:00,5,"I do not know the book. And I do not care about heros. I care about good story telling and exciting cinematography when I watch a movie. ""Unbroken"" begins promising but turns out to be rather boring and not very commited to its characters. Angelina Jolie does not know how to dig into other people¬¥s souls, that¬¥s for sure. None of the characters becomes of any interest, I don¬¥t know anything about their whereabouts, their goals and what they do to survive the horrible Japanese camp where they meet the nasties villain which is played by an eye-rolling actor who only knows one dimension of his complicated character. This movie reminds of one of many war movies from the 60¬¥s, it¬¥s not brave enough to tell the truth about a gay torturer and tries to be more hard-boiled then it finally is. The result is not satisfying at all."
" Something Missing. But still love it.
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,7,"Great movie...this movie make me think different about Japan from the view of America. There should be another angle i.e. from the Japanese view, which will make it more beautiful."
" A truly remarkable story
",2020-09-03 00:00:00,8,"As war stories go, this is one of the most remarkable i have ever seen interpreted on the screen. The no holds barred approach to the portrayal of Zamperini's story in Unbroken goes a long way i feel. This film doesn't sugarcoat the struggle faced by Zamperini and really allows viewers to understand the horrors of war and what it can turn people into. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who enjoys an incredible story!"
" I wish I was unbroken after sitting through this!
",2020-09-01 00:00:00,5,"A good hour of this film could have hit the editor's floor. And when you give a man way more punishment then his body could actually take... you cheapen everything. The lead in was the best... but was not suppose to be the main part of the story.
Very good acting... a good story... but a lot of kicking a dead horse."
" Never forget
",2020-08-19 00:00:00,10,"A fairly accurate portrayal of what the Japanese armed forces did to hundreds of thousands of people during WW2.
This film helps us to remember those victims.
Never forget."
" Weak Sauce
",2020-08-17 00:00:00,5,"This movie lacks gravity. Which is peculiar because it's one of the most suspenseful true stories of all time.
The book was riveting. So let me make this clear- it is not the story that lacks gravity. It is the movie.
The director/writer is not to skilled at adding weight to a scene, putting emotion into scenes, building up to a scene. It is just flat. Which is a serious bummer because like I said it's the craziest most emotional story of all time.
The first time in movie history that a true story has been DOWNPLAYED by Hollywood. Why? Why would they do this? The story is AMAZING Hollywood material, but they dumbed it down for some reason. Maybe to fit a pg13 rating? I don't know why.
It clearly has a massive budget that they think will hide some of its more massive flaws. One of the biggest being the crap writing. This movie really has poor dialogue. This movie is a classic example of a big budget cover up, they have all the big budget traits- fair actors, great set design and lighting, great filming locations, great cgi and cameras, but the movie is just shallow.
They turned an amazing deeply moving story into some shallow easy to watch Hollywood compilation of scenes."
" Unbroken: The story of Victim and Forgiver
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,7,"The biographic movie based on the life of an American hero 'Louie Zamperini', an Olympic runner, depicts the journey of his life events as he joined the army during World War II. Tragically, his plane crashed and they stuck into the Pacific Ocean where after the survival of 47 days drifting on rafts, the Japanese caught them and put them into the POW camp, Tokyo.The movie is full of emotions as it appeals viewers an inspiration articulating the idea of never giving up and fighting in all situations till the end and how a persons life event transform souls into some other highness as he completes the journey from Victim to forgiver when the main culprit comes to visit him at last. It leaves the audience in tears as the screen has shown intense brutality and coldness by Japanese armies towards slaves as gradually the people become empathetic to the main character.The screen has the strong power to capture the audience and bound them but as we read the book, it looks like Angelina has missed many important features that seem more valuable events in Louie Zamperini's life story."
" So much left out.
",2020-07-12 00:00:00,5,"This was a good movie...IF one did not read the book!
So much was left out that the movie left me feeling ""incomplete""."
" Not for the Faint Hearted!
",2020-07-06 00:00:00,4,"After the first 30 minutes this film descends into a battle for survival for the individual for whom this is a true story. Having competed in the 36 Olympics in Berlin, he, like most americans joins the war in 1942. This is the story of 1 man and his fight to get through the brutality of war and isnt for children, given that HE survives 47 days on a raft, without food (eaten by 1 of the survivors!), then taken by the japanese, then becomes victim of a vile corporal of the japanese army who is hardly fit to be called a human being, given his hunger for brutality. If you CAN stomach 1 individual being subjected to continued violence for more than 70 minutes you may well enjoy this....had I read thru the film prior to watching I would not have bothered, making this film doesnt make much sense and the title of Unbroken is a puzzle. For me the only saving grace is that the hero does survive the end of the war and becomes a Christian, which Im guessing the director had no idea how to put into words"
" Man's inhumanity to man....
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,7,"There is always something more horrific about the stories from the Far Eastern theatre of World War II - and this one really does exhibit all to clearly the atrocities carried out on the POWs by their captors. Specifically, this feature concerns US Olympic athlete Louis Zamperini (a very much on-form Jack O'Connell) who is recognised by a soldier (Watanabe - previously a rival athlete) tasked with guarding him - who proceeds to make his life a living hell. We, as an audience, are spared little of the brutality and cruelty imposed on Zamperini - and on the prisoners in general - and though physically and emotionally exhausted, we find ourselves witnessing an astonishing demonstration of determination and pride in the face of this mounting adversity. Amongst a solid supporting cast - Domnhall Gleeson and Garrett Hedlund are great, but Angelina Jolie really has managed to elicit the best from her two lead men here with Miyavi, as Watanabe, superbly menacing, but in an almost pathetic fashion. It is quite a tough watch but certainly well worth the effort."
" Very nice movie...
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,9,I watched this movie in my mother tongue in tamil. Really very very interesting movie. Every scenes are very nice... My sincere congratulations to the director for this work.
" Inspiration
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,8,"Well, it's such a great movie with unique story.
I really liked it."
" Incredible story but I failed to connect
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,7,"Incredible bio pic about the wartime experiences of Louie Zmaperini, an Olympic track star who survives a plane crash in WW2 and later fights for his life (for 47 days) against nature & sharks while stranded at sea and still later as a Japanese POW.Everything about this movie is well done and on a grand scale, the acting, (Jack O'Connell) the reconstitution of the period, the screenplay, cinematography, etc. Yet after viewing this incredibly moving story I was still left feeling strangely underwhelmed. The problem is all the characters (except maybe Watanabe) are without any depth, so there is just a disconnect or lack of emotion and the film didn't ever grab me the way it should have."
" Hands down... THE BEST PICTURE OF 2014
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,10,"This movie was absolutely epic... a true humanitarian movie that really hits home... it had everything, from amazing visual effects, to drama as an olympic runner to pain and heartbreak as a pow.... should have won best picture!!!"
" Pretty decent to be honest
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,8,"I'm actually quite shocked how much I liked this!I actually thought this was going to be quite mediocre (especially as jolie is directing!) but it doesn't Surprisingly disappoint, I know you have probably looked upon here for reviews and seen quite a few people slate it..(some reasons make sense) but it's not one to miss.Incredible story and pretty well acted, the brutal aspect was not missed and didn't shy away from the reality. Some films you can end up quite bored or looking at your watch half way through but no need for this oneNow it could be improved on little areas like the post war years, the ptsd, the Japanese commander not wanting to see him again, his forgiveness but apart from those aspects it's decent."
" Serioulsy jow can it have over 7 rating
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,1,"Boring, boring. Nothing happends, no exitement and nothing to remember. How can it have over 7 rate"
" Failed movie
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,3,"Starting from a good story, this movie is a failure as far as I am concerned as I didn't feel involved in the future of the raft survivors and then the camp prisonners.
The way it was told and shown just wasn't it for me.On the odd side, I felt it strange that Angelina Jolie, a female director, decided to shoot an movie, with almost exclusive actors and no actresses."
" One of my favorite movies!
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,9,"So powerful. If watched after reading the book, one should see this movie NOT as ""triumph of the human spirit"" but as a mighty display of the power of God to save a sinner. That is what Luis, the man behind the true story, would want us to see!"
" Good story, terrible Film-making
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,5,"A good life story is wasted with really bad film-making, editing and performances. And to make things worse, it is too long and several scenes should have been removed."
" The book is better
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,6,The book have a lot of more interesting details and history.
" Overlooked
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,3,The two men rescued in the raft should have brought food and water with them instead of their shaving gear!! (Shouldn't they have had facial hair being stuck in that raft all that time = Director's goof!!!!)
" Robbed at the Oscars!
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,10,"Why, Academy? Why didn't you nominate this for anything? This movie was amazing, and if I had seen it before 2014 ended it would have been on my top 10 list for sure. Jack O'Connell did a phenomenal job as Louis Zamperini, and rivals Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of Alan Turing in ""The Imitation Game."" I can't decide whose acting I liked better. I felt a range of emotion watching this film that I haven't felt in a long time. I was actually yelling at the screen at Takamasa Ishihara who plays Col. Watanabe, the antagonist of the film, because he felt genuinely evil. I wanted to reach through the screen and punch him in the face. This is such a powerful film, and it's a shame it wasn't nominated. I was so amazed at the hardships Louis had to endure, and genuinely felt for him. Everything about this film is amazing. The acting, the writing, even the score. There's something very unusual about this film that was a pleasant surprise to see. Religion is a key factor to the films plot, and it isn't mocked. That's something we need in more films. It's a shame that the real Louis Zamperini passed away before this film was released. I'm sure he'd be proud. This is one of those films that you absolutely must see before you die. It's so inspiring, and puts everything in perspective. Bravo, Angelina Jolie. Bravo.Grade: A+ 10/10 5/5 stars."
" Terrible Movie
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,1,"Maybe Angelina Jolie should stick to acting instead of directing, but I don't think she's very good at acting either."
" Disappointed
",2020-03-14 00:00:00,5,"Maybe if I hadn't read the Laura Hillenbrand book prior to watching this movie I would have given it a higher rating.....maybe, but I had read the book and having done so found the movie to be severely lacking in capturing the story of Louis Zamperini."
" What's with all that negative reviews
",2020-03-12 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed that massively. It did go on a tad longer then it should have but I didn't mind that at all. Jack O'Connell can act, he was absolutely superb and a joy to watch. I'm actually not family with the true story so I don't know if it's right or wrong but I enjoyed it that's the whole reason I watch films and it's for the enjoyment. I also think Angelina Jolie did a fantastic job as director and I don't get the criticism, I think people are just being picky."
" Not a fun film
",2020-03-07 00:00:00,6,"Absolute respect to Louis Zamperini who by all accounts has a story so ridiculously packed with misfortune, luck and mountains to climb that many have speculated if it's really possible to create a film about this man, who died at the grand age of 97 in the same year of this film's release. I'm going to exercise all of my self restraint and not make the obvious joke about him dying of boredom watching this film.The first issue is the run-time, at 2 and a half hours of Prisoner of War Camp with no letting up is a real slog. Seriously, The Deer Hunter is less of a slog than this and that's similar material, and for over 3 hours. I was going to deep dive on my issues but after such a long film, I'm just gonna save us both time and talk more generally on the film as a whole.There's just a lot to take in when you're depicting inhuman events that really happened. These events you expect to see shown in a human way, ramped up to 11 at just the right time, but instead 'Unbroken' looks like a fever dream that is populated by actors who seem unclear on what they're doing.I say this for two reasons. The Fever Dream - I'm not sure how to put this but - there is seemingly no weather in this film (it only rains when it impacts the plot, the rest is glowing sunshine), which gives the very real events depicted an unsuited uncanny valley/Truman Show vibe.As for the supporting cast, I didn't get a solid sense of characterisation from anyone other than Louis Zamperini, and I found some of the acting to be misdirected, which left me wondering if nuances in the script were at times, lost.This was a Christmas movie, and I think I know why. Jolie approaches the material with all the bible-thumping zeal of an Evangelist. ""Repent!"" she cries, ""Repent!"" as she lays yet another misdeed onto the laundry list of misdeeds visited upon Zamperini.Compare this to films like 27 Hours, which while not the same scale of misery, it interspersed its more gruelling scenes of horror and fear amongst the beautiful ones of a life that lead up to those awful moments - pacing. It was effective because it highlighted parallels between ""then"" and ""now"" in the film that were poignant, it gave you a break and it heightened the emotion via contrasting it. That process is non-existent in this film.I hate to say it but I think the problem with this film is one related to class. This movie was not made to entertain, it smacks of that sombre Puritan vibe of American Thankgiving, ""sorry for the killing but thanks for this turkey which we killed because we killed all of you"". Jolie may feel the need to repent at Christmas time, being a highly monied individual, from a highly monied family, but Mrs. Gary Nobody who works six days a week in Tesco or Walmart and only has Christmas Day off to spend with the kids, doesn't need such a self-flaggelating experience as the one delivered by Unbroken."
" Fight
",2020-03-06 00:00:00,9,"I was going to score with an 8, always when I like them I put this score, but the story of his life and his fight made me place a higher score.
I almost lost my life, because a car crashed when I crossed the street, I don't know if I will ever forgive, what Louis shows is that faith and hope are very important to move forward in life"
" ( American B+ Movie) My Ratings 9/10
",2020-03-03 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed this movie. I think it was well done and painted a picture of the time that many movies fail to fully grasp. It was a bit long, but when adapting a novel into a movie, it's hard to produce a good film without eliminating a chunk of excellent material. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves history, drama, or a good lesson in perseverance."
" Horrible director-
",2020-02-10 00:00:00,1,"Why does the lead character who has been lost at sea for 40 days fighting for survival look shaved in a raft, while his friends are dying, with a goatee even later in years in a hostile prison camp? He's shaving in a raft while being shot at etc?? Continuity you find in Storyboards. I was friends with the Zamperinis . This isn't a director. This is a poser!"
" Scratching my head
",2020-02-04 00:00:00,4,"What is happening. Quite unsure why this has occurred this way. The movie moves like a snail, to cross street. But when it is there, it is picked up and thrown back to where it is from. A lot work for nothing. I think Jolie is a good director, but this is no good. Hope she does better in future."
" Long and suffering
",2020-01-30 00:00:00,6,"2 hours of watching a man suffering. All the hallmarks for a great flm were there with a good story, excellent cinematography and a proven director; however the story didn't translate to the big screen, you could feel the same emotion reading a text book. I'd recommend to read the biography, if there is one and then watch Bridge over the river Kwai.Beaumondo"
" Am I the only one?
",2020-01-25 00:00:00,7,"Why is nobody working anymore during the ""push-up"" scene? Even the Japanese are flabbergasted, which made the ""best scene of the movie"" a bit unrealistic."
" Strong story. Solid war movie.
",2020-01-22 00:00:00,7,"I'm a bit late for the ""debate"" of Jolie becoming a director, I know. This movie is after all 6 years old by now. But, I don't understand why Jolie got so much hate for trying to direct. I asume it has to be about ""know your place"" kind of thing.No, this is not a masterpiece of a movie and the best movie ever made. And Jolie doesn't deserve to be praised to the heavens, win an Oscar and later perhaps become the first female president of the USA, I mean, who knows, might happen. Perhaps starting a whole new age with a nation of female superpower. Where the feminine is ruling over the masculine. Up is down, black is white. And males are slaves to the females, cheap workforce and nothing else, building the women's world and empire, for them. And the males with best genes, are kept in stock, in certain constructed confined settlements just made for them, to be taken out and used only as sex slaves and their ""special juice"" for reproduction, when needed. The new world order. Where females rules as a superior class and males are just to be used for their bodies. I don't think we actually have to really fear this happening. Even though how likely it might sound.Yes, Jolie is a women. Yes, she's a famous, successful, rich, actress. And all of a sudden she wants to direct. Who does she think she is? For starters, does she not know how privledge she already is? She should just be happy and contempt with her successful acting career. Not wanting to direct. Why should we, the viewers, be forced to watch her attempt to be a creator of the vision for an whole movie?Well, while valid points. I have to review this movie for what it is in its final form, besides all that other stuff. And... it's actually pretty good. Strong story, very much worth telling, since it's based on reality. I'm glad someone made a movie about it. Is it the best movie ever made? No. Is it the best war movie ever made? No. But, I have to say, that personally, it really moved me. And it was well shot and well acted. It's a solid 7 for me. A movie that is good to watch when you need some inspiration going trough hard times perhaps. Which is not a bad thing at all. I can't actually see anything horrible wrong with it. The scope of the movie is actually pretty big and executed very well. People involved, that Jolie brought together, knew what they were doing and manged to do something (while not the greatest piece of cinema ever made) something worth seeing, to the least. So, why should Jolie not direct? I really don't get it."
" Oscar level
",2020-01-13 00:00:00,10,"If you're not seeing the level of acting here you are blind!!! Best movie I've seen since Green Book! Yes,I'm behind."
" One of the most facinating motivational movie I've watched 'til date....
",2019-12-11 00:00:00,8,"This movie is about the life of Louis Zamperini an olympian and later on a war veteran too...the movie gives some flashes of his boyhood and then what majorly shown in the film is how he becomes part of a well know war of America and Japan.....
It shows a brilliant direction and cinematography and makes it a perfect piece"
" Well done but.....
",2019-12-11 00:00:00,7,"This movie has a lot going for it, great acting great directing, and a great plot. When I started the movie I didn't realize how war heavy this was going to be so maybe I wasn't in the right mindset early on. There were many moments where I found myself cringing over what was happening to the main character in this movie along with several others. It occasionally bounced around too much in time periods and I wasn't as invested in the characters as I feel I should have been. Although I am giving this movie 7 Stars, I do not believe that this is a seven star movie that I will watch again. Time will tell."
" Could Hear the Heartbeat of War Prisoners
",2019-12-10 00:00:00,8,"I always go through the movie reviews & try to see the different sides which I have missed. And I noticed people have brutally criticized this movie because of their dislike on Angelina Jolie.This movie is one of the best in years. Watched 4 times, and could not ever mind Angelina when watching. There is no female lead but the performances are eye-catching. The cinematography is excellent, and so the makeup. All the locations can make the audience feel like they are standing next to Louis.'Unbroken' does not spread anger towards any party. At some level, even felt pity for the Japanese Sergeant.Will be watching this again. A great inspiration for the movie makers."
" Quick Ending
",2019-12-03 00:00:00,6,True story - which is behind belief. Great acting by Louie and the guy that plays the Bird is particularly terrifying. I thought the ending was a little too quick. Otherwise a great movie
" Not that good
",2019-10-21 00:00:00,5,"Ok, but doesn't go into depth with war detail, CGI isn't that good, The plot is lackluster."
" Unbroken - I was broken after this turkey
",2019-10-12 00:00:00,3,"Other reviewers have been very eloquent and specific in their reviews and I cannot match their perceptiveness but I have to leave some review to state how disappointed I was with this very poor film which could have been a cinema classic if the book had been adapted in a better way.
This film will have huge appeal for sadomasochists as a great proportion of it was taken up with men being hit with a stick and punched in the the face, suffering unspeakable punishments and terrible hardships.
I feel embarrassed if this was an attempt by Jolie to show that women could make as good a movie as men, book by a woman, directed/produced by a woman, and casting director. It's ironic that Jolie seems to have targeted this directly at Academy awards looking for a big scoop yet the only Oscar nominations went to men and Alliance of Women Film Journalists nominated it for Movie You Wanted to Love, But Just Couldn't. There are great female directors but this wasn't one to remember. The book by all accounts is a massive best-seller and Laura's two non-fiction books, this one and Sea Biscuit, have sold over 10 million copies and Unbroken has 28,000 reviews on Amazon almost all 5 stars whereas this film averages just over 50% on Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes.
I can only imagine the Coen brothers must be mortified to be involved with this film as the screenplay was truly dreadful and I suspect the brothers put their name to it and took a cheque. The film did make money as I think the box office went well off the back off big names, a great story and book, and massive PR and marketing.
I love gritty war films, tales of great human endeavour, strength and courage, guts and determination, athletics, triumph over adversity, true story - this book had it all, the film had all the potential ingredients of a historic top 100 greatest films of all time in the genre of The great escape, Forrest Gump, Castaway, Hacksaw Ridge, Shawshank, Green mile, Saving private Ryan, but Jolie ruined it and she churned out a TV 'B' movie which dragged on and on and an inspirational life story was turned into a monotonous bland documentary with lots of gratuitous violence.
Yes we get it the Japanese prison warden was a cruel evil man but the story had more to offer than an hour of beatings and blood. The book reported that Watanabe stated the prisoners were 'enemies of Japan' so the film reiterated this mantra ad nauseam. These men were confined in close quarters together for months on end in awful conditions, in a liferaft, in various prisons and camps and yet there was nothing but the briefest, unemotional dialogues of the ""pass me the salt old boy"" type. There was no character development or relationships and bonds. Staring at photos of loved ones with a glycerine tear running down the cheek is a very poor substitute for great dialogue and acting and makes for a low-quality film. The hair and makeup was a joke as a nobody grew a beard after a month in a liferaft or in remote prison cells. None of the men outside of the main stars got any dialogue and just moped around looking dirty and glum and then when forced to punch our hero in the face they hit him as hard as they possibly could then moped away again. The important scenes of drama and emotion were very poor and the whole film really felt like a docu-drama as opposed to making a great story into a great film. The casting was poor as the main characters were picked for looks and the ability to look skinny when starved rather than any acting ability, in particular Watanabe was especially weak and lacking substance.
If you want some great Japanese war acting go watch Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence and Bridge of the river Kwai and for athletics and war what about Chariots of fire, for bombers what about Dam busters and Memphis Belle.
What a wasted opportunity to make an all-time classic, I only hope a talented, experienced director gets to do a remake one day.
Truly the best part of this film was the beautiful track 'Miracles' by Coldplay but unfortunately you had to wait until the credits rolled to hear it!"
" Unbroken broke my heart
",2019-06-06 00:00:00,9,"When I heard about Louie's story I was heart broken because how the Japanese did to him, they beat him, touring him and hating him. The movie really showed how the bird hated Louie so he had the camp punch him to show him respect, he got hit 220 times. Then how they survived on the raft, they also kept their minds sane. Wow the movie is really hard to watch."
" Those haircuts!
",2019-05-28 00:00:00,5,"Second time to watch this movie and I just cant stop admiring everyone's haircuts whilst pow's in japan.
Not only are they all clean shaven but those haircuts are amazing, short back and sides all round, even styling for some (un)lucky inmates.
Plausible movie ruined by a simple lack of directive attention to detail.... Angeline!"
" When you get the job just because you're famous
",2019-05-10 00:00:00,2,"I'm getting desperate!
The last four or five movies I've seen on Netflix have been very thin gruel and this one doesn't thicken it up at all.The Terracotta Warriors could have done a better job than the entire cast, who admittedly have to handle a story that's been done a million times, 999,999 of which were better than this one.Jolie obviously doesn't have a clue when it comes to directing and this movie has all the hallmarks of the boss being surrounded by yes men who are scared to call out lousy work.OK , so the hero is an Olympian and knows how to suffer.. so do riders in the Tour-de- France, so did Arctic explorers (although they're volunteers)
His story is no different than all of the other POW's who had to endure those sadistic Japanese camps so why him?This stinks of somebody waking up in the morning and saying to themselves "" I want to make a movie.. doesn't matter what it's about, I just want to do it""There's absolutely no plot or message, so it wanders aimlessly to an ending that looks like a New Year's review on the TVI don't want to denigrate the terrible experiences that prisoners of the Japanese went through but this isn't the vehicle to show what incredible hardships these men suffered."
" Actor as Director
",2019-03-27 00:00:00,2,It is seldom an Actor is good as a Producer. Clint Eastwood may be one of the few exceptions. Actors should remain in their profession insetad of destroying a good story. So please Angelina - don't produce any more films.
" Rather sadistic
",2019-02-16 00:00:00,5,"This film is based on the life of Louis Zamperini who was a U.S. runner in the 1936 Summer Olympics and later served in World War II in the battle against Japan.There are many scenes well filmed by director Angelina Jolie and the film serves well as one person's difficult story during the war.The main trouble overall is that the film spends too much time prolonging torture, torment, and humiliation scenes in a prison camp. Indeed, such information is important but the film could have reduced some of these difficult scenes and spent more of the film portraying how Zamperini managed to deal with the experiences after the worst times were over and how he managed to reconcile such torment.A brief review of this film at Toronto's Now Magazine finished with the phrase ""Strictly for Sadists"". While, I don't completely agree with the comment, I fully understand it. - dbamateurcritic"
" Overrated.....
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,1,"I could not wait for this film to end. All the characters lacked personality and acted like robots.. This is the sort of film that is on Christmas Day, with the rest of rubbish films.that no one watches."
" Waste of all resources
",2019-01-24 00:00:00,1,Angelina jolie and coen brothers! This is a very basic tv movie and it has no depth or excitement no characters involved just about 1 guy beaten out and tortured for 2 hours!
" Being Something Through Competition and Survival
",2019-01-15 00:00:00,8,"3 January 2015. There is likely a balance to be struck between reality of a relatively famous person's life and the dramatization of it onto the big screen. Assuredly there might be even more amazing life stories out there and there might be even more captivating ways to selectively develop movie appeal. Yet as a director and executive producer, Angelina Jolie, has produced a film that appears to encompass a balance between real and interest in this movie. The audience is introduced to brief scenes of a young boy who doesn't believe in himself as an Italian in America outcast, to a big brother prodded athletic competitor, to a fearsome World War II experience over the skies of Japan, to lost at sea, and then prisoner of war.This movie fuses a sports and war theme into a biographical display of endurance and survival. Unbroken brings the intensity of competition as displayed by Francis Osmet's 1913 U.S. Golf Open in The Greatest Game Ever Played (2005), the physical and mental torture of Michael Caine in the espionage classic and BAFTA Best Film The Ipcress Files (1965), the struggle of survival of The Life of Pi (2012), Mel Gibson's Golden Globe Best Foreign Picture nominee Apocalypto (2006) or Steven Spielberg's Best Oscar picture Schindler's List (1993). The difficulty faced by Jolie was sustaining the momentum and power of the movie with the different pacing elements without an action-thriller-adventure theme. Instead Jolie faced the difficulty of a biographical sports, sustained survival theme like that faced by Tom Hanks' Golden Globe winner in Cast Away (2000). With what Jolie faced, Unbroken appears almost unscathed in its ability to bring forth this true life, heroic story."
" Great Movie, about real hero's.
",2018-12-07 00:00:00,9,"I don't understand the negative ratings and the ditto comments towards Angelina Jolie, I think it's a great movie, I did not read the book so I had no expectations, but enjoyed it very much. I also think that the film told the story very well, the heroism, the brutality of the Japanese and the will to survive. I salute Angelina for a directors debut of this quality."
" a strong spirit sadly doesn't pay off
",2018-11-21 00:00:00,2,Review: I found this to be an interesting movie because it shows you how strong the human spirit is. The direction and screenplay are both surprisingly good. The casting and acting aren't bad either. The stage crew did a really good job making us feel like we really were in world war II while watching the movie. All in all I would give this two out of a possible five stars.
" Can Faith Keep You From Breaking?
",2018-11-13 00:00:00,9,"The 2014 film, Unbroken, is the true story of Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini, who survived 47 days at sea and two years in Japanese prisoner of war camps during World War II. Directed by Angelina Jolie, Unbroken is based on the 2010 book of the same name by Laura Hillenbrand. Jack O'Connell plays the role of Louie Zamperini, and Domhnall Gleeson and Miyavi join him in the supporting roles of Phil and Watanabe. The title appropriately describes Zamperini's spirit and body despite the harsh conditions and abuse he endures during his life. Unbroken powerfully portrays the amazing life of Louie Zamperini and shows how belief in yourself and strong faith can help people survive the harshest of life's circumstances.Louie grew up as a troubled Italian immigrant. Thanks to his brother, Pete, he turned to running to stay out of trouble and release his frustrations, and he was chosen to be an Olympic runner for the United States of America. In the 1934 Olympics, Louie set a last lap record of 56 seconds, and the experience left him looking forward to the next opportunity in Tokyo. These Olympics were not in his future, and instead, Louie was commissioned by the military as a Lieutenant. During a rescue mission, his plane crashed and only three survived. Louie survived on a raft for 47 days and is eventually found by a Japanese Warship. The Japanese take Louie and his one surviving companion, Phil, to a Japanese prison camp where Louie is personally tortured by, ""The Bird."" Louie is extremely tough throughout his journey and uses other people's faith and belief to build him up.The movie is the life story of Louie, so much is portrayed from his perspective. Though the movie is very plot-driven, the theme of ""if you can take it you can make it"" is a prime focus. Pete, Louie's older brother, coined this quote to encourage Louie to make it despite the adversities he faced. Louie is always experiencing troubles, and yet he is always able to channel enough strength to power through. There were many times in which Louie could have easily died, but he carried on and survived. Louie thrives on the faith of others and their belief in him to continue. At the beginning of the film, Louie's mother is praying that her family will be helped and that her son Louie would begin to behave. He also admires his fellow soldier, Phil's faith. Louie uses the encouragement of his brother and others to first make the track team and later survive the abuses of war. Another example of his perseverance is when Louie is running in the Olympics, and he begins to fall behind. He then hears his brother Pete in his head saying, ""Come on Louie"" and he runs the Olympic record for the final lap of his race. Louie was also part of a bombing in which Phil, the pilot, was praying that they were not hit by a bomb and Louie is calmed and given hope from Phil's prayer. Finally, when Louie arrives at the prison camp, he meets a cabin guard who tells Louie that he can survive his beatings, and he takes this advice, as it reminds him that ""if you can take it you can make it.""The movie tells the story from the perspective of Louie and some characters are missing for parts of the story. For example, when Phil and Louie get separated, there was a significant part of the movie where viewers are uncertain if he survived the war. In addition, Pete provided significant influence and support to Louie, but viewers do not get to know him as a person. ""The Bird"" was a horrid person both in real life and in the movie, but the story provides no background on him. His history may have added an interesting perspective to the movie and how he became so cruel.While Unbroken is action-packed, emotionally moving, and full of historical details, there are elements of the movie that may disturb some viewers. Violence and death are common elements of the movie. In the beginning, soldiers are killed in air battle, and Zamperini's friend, Mac, dies after about 30 days at sea. During the years in the POW camp, Zamperini and other suffer unimaginable abuse at the hands of the Bird. In one scene, Zamperini is beaten by what looks like hundreds of soldiers and is left to suffer on the grounds of the camp. While these scenes may be too heavy for some movies, they are not as graphic as many other war movies. The movie is rated PG-13, and much language and violence that was common to war is not present in this film. Editors likely eliminated more realistic elements of war to allow for a wider range of viewers. Another element of the movie that could be improved relates to some of the scenery and filmography. There are scenes in the movie that did not seem to be real or historically realistic. The initial scenes from the airplanes look too clear and perfect to be a war scene. The plane flew smoothly despite bullets penetrating it and killing some passengers. Also, when Zamperini is taken to the Tokyo radio station to speak to Americans, the buildings and setting seem too modern to be World War II Japan. Unbroken is a well made historical film that tells one man's victorious survival through great peril. Louie is quite a likeable character who will appeal very much to people in the ages 12 and up. Despite the lack of some realistic war elements, this film is still overall historically accurate and touching. This movie is best suited for families with older children, or history fans interested in WWII or American heroes."
" I don't want to blame it on Angelina Jolie's directing, but. . .
",2018-10-31 00:00:00,4,"While the story of Louis Zamperini is truly amazing, Unbroken doesn't quite reach the bar. This movie is missing the heart of the book it is based on. The acting is fine, the sets are good and the visual effects are well done, but it doesn't have the emotional punch that it needed. I don't want to blame it on Angelina Jolie's directing, but. . ."
" Not an easy film to watch but worth it nonetheless
",2018-10-31 00:00:00,7,"Well, Angelina Jolie has established she can direct and she can direct well.The movie isnt easy to watch but dont get me wrong, it is because of the content. Jolie has been able to convey a tough subject artfully, depicting violence and pain in equal measure with human redemption. The scenes towards the end of the movie are quite powerful.Jack O'Connell has outdone himself from the last time I saw him in Eden Lake. To give such a powerful and emotional performance at the age pf 24 is remarkable.. This one deserves every accolade that comes his way for his portrayal of Louie Zamparini in this movie."
" Wonderful movies
",2018-09-19 00:00:00,10,"Amazing movies, it is underrated on imdb, i want to watch it again and again, and also wait for second pary"
" People are missing the point.
",2018-09-15 00:00:00,7,"This will be a quick review, as having watched it for the second time recently I feel I understand was Jolie was trying to do here. I've read a lot of reviews saying it's just 2+ hours of grim and hopeless misery, save for the last 5 minutes of the film. It might shock people to know that that is the point. The whole point of the spending so much time on the raft, or in the POW camps was to showcase how bad it was for the longest time possible - it mirrors what Zamperini went through, and isn't supposed to make you feel triumphant or warm. No matter what happens to you, you stick through it - but sticking through it doesn't mean every little victory is felt as such. For those waiting for the fanfare of surviving being punched by every other prisoner, I got news for you - there wasn't. The movie only takes liberty in this regard with the lifting of the timber. The point I'm getting at is that the movie does away with the traditional 'stiff upper lip' theme that a lot of war movies present, despite the fact that the mantra of ""If you can take it, you can make it"" being echoed throughout the runtime. There was no reward and no accomplishment felt when Zamperini continued to endure the torture and the starvation, and the movie hammers it home by making sure we endure as much of it as possible. Of course this doesn't' make the movie perfect, the flashbacks to Zamperini's childhood are all too cliched, and stand out like a sore thumb in contrast to the rest of the film's subversion of expected emotion. The ending also feels a bit weird, and suddenly goes upbeat as we read what happened to Zamperini after the war. This was possibly due to the tragic fact that he passed away the same year the film released, and it felt only fair to celebrate his life, despite that not being the point of the movie. In summary, the movie is not going to be for everyone. It is grim, dark and showcases the endurance Zamperini made in detail, and thats exactly the point. It is also shot fairly well, and Desplat's score is something to be noted."
" Nice haircuts despite the depravation!
",2018-09-10 00:00:00,5,"Reasonably good movie, entertaining, reflecting a true story.BUT...... seriously bad continuity regarding credibility..... throughout it all, the soldiers maintain immaculate haircuts, in a modern style..... really..... and the movie is supposed to be taken seriously! 
Not the only flick guilty of this by the way, keep an eye open in future and you'll often see this."
" This is what we have to learn
",2018-08-09 00:00:00,8,This is unbelievable movie which actually happened in real life. We have to learn what we've done in history cuz I'm Japanese.
" Do not watch if you have read the book
",2018-07-21 00:00:00,1,"I know that it is hopeless to think that a movie can possibly live up to that of the original book, but come on Angelina? Really? This was a terrible terrible TERRIBLE adaptation of the story. There is absolutely no character development. You learn a total of two names the whole movie! I can't possibly imagine Zemperini himself would have given this ""movie"" more than 1 star. There is an obscene amount of development and crucial events left out of this film. All the heart and gut wrenching sections of the book are turned into a sloppy two second portrayal of entire chapters. I honestly think Angelina was sitting there thumbing through the book and thought ""oh, we better put this CRUCIAL event into the movie, um. Louie, go stand over there and look dazed, perfect, got it."" COME ON! It made me so sad to have read the book and then see this pathetic attempt to relay even a fraction of the story. SO SO SO SO much is left out. If I hadn't read the book I would have been completely lost. The Bird was a complete sociopath, absolute lunatic that I sincerely hope is somewhere very hot right now. This movie showed him as a disgruntled guard that was a little power hungry. COME ON, ANGELINA!!!!!!! At least try to put some depth to him. Did you even read the book?????? At the end of the movie I was so surprised that it was over. I thought this can't possibly be it. There is so much left out. Made me very very very sad to think that this is the movie representation that a great man is remembered by...... agh....."
" Jolie was running her own race!
",2018-07-18 00:00:00,1,"I read the book and laughed and cried with these men, and Angelina Jolie raced through this like she had a checklist. I could hear her yelling OK NEXT SCENE! the parts that were touching, were overlooked, and the parts that made you care were skipped over. The rescue from the raft skipped entirely and was tantamount to explaining their survival. 
This movie left me feeling empty, wondering if anyone involved actually read the lifechanging book from whence it was born. 
Characters you should hate and have nightmares about, left you feeling nothing. These were REAL MEN. HEROES. The team that did band of brothers could have made this into something that changed history of cinema, instead we got a hollow outline, that left me tired and a little bored. What a waste. Read the book Instead. I love movies and hate those who always claim the book is better but in this case, no truer words were ever spoken."
" I've watched it many times and still 10/10
",2018-06-12 00:00:00,10,First of all this movie protrays everything beautifully. There are no non needed or overused scenes and it's pretty damn entertaining.
" This Movie Touched Me
",2018-06-04 00:00:00,10,"I absolutely loved this movie, and as a Marine Veteran everyones story is always different but one will never understand unless you have been in that person's shoes. To watch this movie from beginning to end from his point of view I could not possibly imagine what he went through. It was like one thing after another but by the Glory of God he was still standing and left ""Unbroken"" This one will definitely go on the shelfs of top movies I have watched and may God rest his soul!"
" A must...Must....MUST Watch

" IF I CAN TAKE IT, I CAN MAKE IT
",2018-05-02 00:00:00,6,"This is based on the true story of Olympic Gold Medalist Louie Zamperini (Jack O'Connell) and his internment in a Japanese POW camp. As a POW war film, it wasn't as good as many of the fictional offerings. The intent of the film was to be inspirational. Louie lived by the motto, ""If I can take it, I can make it,"" not my first choice for a life motto. Apparently it is his spirit that was ""Unbroken"" as they broke his body and damaged his mind. He was held captive by ""The Bird"" (Takamasa Ishihara) a man who talked to Louie like a dysfunctional lover saying, ""Don't look at me."" to the point nausea.At one point the troops are moved and as a bombardier, Louie had to personally see the damaged his kind caused, but there was no emotional, ""what have we done"" scene. In fact at the end, he credits his faith as carrying him through his internment and surviving enhanced interrogation techniques, yet we see minimal evidence of that while he was imprisoned.It is a film that fails to convey the message that was in the book, except as a post script. At one point I had a Mel Brooks moment and thought what a great musical this could be using the songs, R-E-S-P-E-C-T, and ""Working in a Coal Mine."" My bad. This was a limited inspirational adaptation.Guide: No f-bombs, or sex. Male rear nudity."
" AVOID.
",2018-02-11 00:00:00,1,"The timeless contract between director and cinema-goer is to make us care about the movie, to change our thinking in some way, to transport us, to make our lives better. Unbroken does none of these. In some ways, it is similar to Scorsese's Silence, which is two hours of unremitting medieval torture, or I√±√°rritu's Revenant, which was diCaprio grunting through snow for 2+ hours.Jolie's Unbroken is a litany of Japanese cruelty and brutality. Up to a certain point, it shows how realistic WWII POW camps were, but this is not a documentary but a movie. It is meant, according to the unspoken contract mentioned above, to take the viewer on a journey, make him care about a character, see a character grow (even despite tremendous adversity), and give the viewer some kind of emotional cathartic satisfaction at the end.In Unbroken, though, Jolie minimalises any character growth in a rather spartan ""show the viewers and let them figure out what is going on"" methodology. As a result, Zamperini, our lead character, simply exists from one scene to the next. He does not show any emotional growth arc whatsoever. He simply takes all the multifarious beatings his captors give him as though that were enough. Ms Jolie, it is NOT. We need to see a character move as an active participant in the story, as a maker of events, not a passive recipient. To put it bluntly, here is the storyline (spoiler alert.)Zamperini gets captured. He gets beaten often and mistreated. The End. Sure there is a brief storyboard at the conclusion of the movie which fleshed out the character a little, but it is NOT ENOUGH. I suspect that Ms Jolie believed that the various scenes that she so treasured would trigger the same emotional responses in her audience as her, a sadly mistaken belief. Towards the end of the movie, I was badly needing Zamperini to DO something instead of just accept further beatings. We saw NOTHING of his internal journey, NOTHING of any form of resistance, NOTHING but an endless series of beatings and Watanabe, his tormentor, saying the same things over and over and beating him without any point at all.The end, when it came, was a glorious relief, and I say that in a negative sense. Count this a failure, Ms Jolie. Do better next time, if there is a next time."
" Astonishing true story told in enjoyable fashion
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"'Unbroken' is a great film, helped immensely by the fact it's based on an almost-unbelievable true story. Laura Hillenbrand's novel was one of the best I've read in the last three years and while the movie isn't quite as great (they never are!), the story of Louis Zamperini (O'Connell)'s extremely eventful life from 1936-1945 truly needs to be seen to be believed. Quick synopsis: he learns to run, goes to the Olympics, joins the U.S. Air Force during WWII, is shot down, stranded at sea (for seven weeks!), eventually captured by the Japanese and spends over two years in a POW camp. Sounds impossible, but what's more astonishing is that he then went on to live for another 70 years!Jolie's directing debut is solid, with some nice transitions from the current to his past and the narrative moving along at a good pace for the first 90min. my one issue with the film is that the final 45min or so drag a little, as although there's plenty going on during his time in the POW camps (i.e. mostly inhumane torture), the film seems to lose a bit of it's spark. Brisbane/Moreton Bay does a good job of standing in for the South Pacific too!This is not so much a film about war, as about survival, courage and hope. There's so many times when he could have just given in and let all the terrible things happening to him defeat him, but he doesn't. It's truly amazing to know it actually happened! The ending is handled well and the actors - particularly Ishihara as the psychopathic 'Bird' - are solid."
" Uninspired
",2017-12-14 00:00:00,5,"Angelina Jolie aims to direct a prestige film with a stirring score and a screenplay that involved the Coen Brothers.Unfortunately you get a film that has seen it all before written all over it, a film that lacks depth and some of its pure hokum The scene where Zamperini's fellow POWs are forced to line up and beat him up is just so laughably bad and Jolie makes sure the final scene is bathed in sunset colours and never realised it was all utter tosh.Jack O'Connell gives a spirited performance as Louis Zamperini, a former Olympic athlete turned bomber pilot who crashes, he and his crew survive for days in the sea before being captured and sent to a Japanese POW camp.We have little idea why the camp commander takes a dislike to Zamperini and why he shows such brutality towards him but Zamperini stoically and defiantly takes it all. I do think he deserved a better a film."
" Thanks Angelina Jolie
",2017-12-02 00:00:00,6,"""Unbroken"" tells quietly one of the most remarkable stories ever. Louis Zamperini was a heroic individual that this film does not pay tribute to. It's forgettable and generic. Angelina Jolie's direction is just awful, I would have taken any other director to do this film than her. The meaning of Zamperini's legacy is brushed over repeatedly, thanks to Jolie's contributions. The film's premise is meant to be inspiring, but strays way far from it. For the positives, though few, it's shot beautifully, and the acting benefits the film. Like ""Free State of Jones"", I'm delighted that the film exists, but it could have been so much better just like the latter film. ""Unbroken"" is damp compared to the ground-breaking book, as it numerously repeats itself hoping that the audience will forget the meaning of the scenes are constantly matched, which qualifies for it to be tedious."
" Great movie, great acting = must see
",2017-11-16 00:00:00,7,"A deserving 7 to 7,5 out of 10 with great acting by Jack O'Connell in a role of Louis Zamperini.From an amateur point of you and someone who just enjoys watching all kinds of movies this is a great kind of inspirational/biography I enjoy watching.Today where there so many movies coming out, if your looking for this kind of a movie you should definitely watch this and you will not be disappointed and you will be amazed about some memorable scenes and a great story it share with its viewers."
" Fantastic, beautiful movie if you've never read the book lol......
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,8,"IMDb reviews are always perplexing, hence why I don't really come here all that often. After watching this movie, however, I had to jump in to clarify what a great movie this is and how to differentiate it from the negative reviews - based on your familiarity with the story. I had never heard of Zamperini's story prior to seeing this. With that in mind, I didn't have nearly a high enough standard to hold the film up to as fans of the book did. That standard is plenty high though, as far as war films go. Would absolutely recommend seeing it if you're not familiar - Zamperini's struggle almost doesn't seem real it's so epic in scope.I've seen quite a few naysayers on here complaining about the lack of character development and overly brutal torture scenes that go on and on. Although I agree the character development could be more dynamic at parts, WAR is WAR! The director Angelina Jolie did not sugarcoat life as a POW - it is quite literally suffering, torture, and death 24/7, particularly in Japanese camps. Anyone asking for ""less torture"" is doing a serious injustice to the pain our armed forces endured. You SHOULD know their pain, and know it well. Others also said the movie felt ""heavily routine"" and bland. Again, having never heard of Zamperini, I find it hard to understand what's routine and bland about going to the Olympics, falling out of the sky into shark infested waters for 45 days on a single life boat, surviving not one but two POW camps, and in the end, forgiving your own captors that tortured you. I kept thinking the movie was going to randomly end at any point and Zamperini rescued, but this was delayed in a fantastic way. I get that the book had a lot more aspects of the struggle going for it, but this is 2 hours people. Lots of audiences already find that too long, sadly. Jolie condensed what she could as best she could with the Coen brothers imho. I also liked to trying comparing this to Hacksaw Ridge, another excellent competitor in the selfless war movie genre. Both have fantastic stories and harrowing moments, but HR seemed weirdly more clich√© than Unbroken did, to me. HR didn't have enough slow moments to breathe, subtle character moments that show you things off-camera that help set the scene (wide expanse of the Pacific Ocean in unbroken, Macks foreshadowing nervous demeanor). The dialogue at times also seemed heavily Hollywood-ized instead of the more realistic soldier dialogue from Unbroken. There was something more haunting about seeing every one of Zamperinis' friends fall victim to their circumstances than the expected-to- die soldier companions in HR. There are truly some remarkable things in Unbroken that make it an absolute worthwhile film to watch. Anyone saying otherwise is looking a little too deep."
" A stock tale let down by directorial inexperience
",2017-08-22 00:00:00,5,"UNBROKEN is a WW2 movie that once again has the hook of being based on a true story. This one's about an Olympic runner who becomes a bomber pilot and who ends up in a life raft in the middle of the Pacific after his plane develops a mechanical fault. This occupies the first half of the running time; the second half moves into prisoner of war territory. This film received a lot of attention for being directed by Angelina Jolie, but it feels very much like she's copying Clint Eastwood's style; he, of course, directed her in CHANGELING, so it's a basic imitation more than anything else.Sadly, Jolie makes some novice mistakes here; the story goes on far too long at times, and ends up being full of sappy, cheesy stuff at the climax, stuff that had me wincing in embarrassment; it was so gritty earlier on, too. Jack O'Connell gives a fine performance as the lead, but this does feel too derivative of the likes of LIFE OF PI and in particular MERRY Christmas, MR. LAWRENCE."
" Well-made but too bland and middle-of-the-road
",2017-08-09 00:00:00,6,"'Unbroken' is set during WWII and tells the incredible true story of an Olympic athlete, Louis Zamperini, who survived 47 days in a raft at sea, only to be caught by the Japanese and sent to a prison camp, where he is tortured by a sadistic Japanese commander. It's an unbelievable story and one that had the potential to be turned into a memorable film, but 'Unbroken' doesn't really do the story justice.The main problem with the film is its surprising lack of any real emotion. It left me cold, I didn't feel a connection with any of what was happening on screen. Louis is such an easy character to sympathise with, he's somebody you naturally want to see survive and succeed, but I never felt that when I was watching the film. 'Unbroken' is an easy film to sit through because it's so well-made, but I felt detached. It lacks character and is too bland to be remembered."
" Poor representation of an amazing story
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,3,"I read ""Devil at my Heels,"" and was amazed at Louis' story. I was surprised I had not heard of Lucky Lou before, and was excited to see the movie as well. I finally got around to seeing the movie on cable, and it was a let down. I know that books and movies can be different, but watching this was like watching a made for TV movie, not a major film."
" Unbroken
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,7,"I had heard about this wartime movie during the time it was in cinemas, I already wanted to see it because of its inclusion during awards season, but then more so when I realised it was directed by actress Angelina Jilie, and written by brothers Joel and Ethan Coen (Fargo, No Country for Old Men, Inside Llewyn Davis, Bridge of Spies). Basically Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini (Jack O'Connell) is an Italian-American young man from Torrance, California, in his childhood he was a troublemaker, and often picked on by other kids for being of Italian ethnicity. But Louie grows up more disciplined, becoming an accomplished distance runner, earning him the nickname ""The Torrance Tornado"", qualifying for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany, coming 8th in the 5,000 meters race, and setting a record for speed in the final lap. Then Louie joins the armed forces in World War II, becoming a bombardier of a United States Army Air Forces B-24 Liberator bomber, during a bombing mission against the Japanese-held island of Nauru, the plane is badly damaged in combat and crashes in the ocean. Louie survives, alongside Russell ""Phil"" Phillips (Domhnall Gleeson) and Francis ""Mac"" McNamara (Finn Wittrock), they live on two rafts, over the next few days they survive on the remaining rations until they run out, then on fish and rain water. On the 27th day, they get the attention of a passing Japanese plane, but it flies over and fires at them, damaging the rafts but missing them, Mac dies 6 days later of exhaustion, and finally on the 47th day, they are found by Japanese sailors. Louie and Phil are captured and become prisoners of war, taken to Kwajalein Atoll and kept in a dungeon, Louie finds out nine U.S. Marines have been held captive on the island, all have been beheaded. One day later, the Japanese ask Louie and Phil to tell them about E-class bombers and the Norden bomb sight, Louie states they flew D-class, on another day they are dragged, disrobed and kneel on planks, they believe it is their execution, the two are shocked that they are crudely washed to be shipped to mainland Japan, but they are separated and sent to different POW camps. Louie's camp, ≈åmori, in Tokyo, is headed by Japanese corporal Mutsuhiro ""The Bird"" Watanabe (Takamasa Ishihara, aka Miyavi), he treats Louie cruelly, being a former Olympian and an American officer. Louie escapes torture when two Japanese newsmen give him the opportunity to broadcast a message home saying that he is alive, but he refuses to broadcast a second message with anti-American propaganda, so back at the camp Watanabe has each other prisoners punch him to teach him respect. Two years later Watanabe is promoted and leaves the camp, American forces bomb Tokyo and the camp is damaged, Louie and the other internees are forced to move to Naoetsu prison camp, Louie is horrified to find Watanabe in charge, he continues to suffer exhaustion and beatings. At the end of the war, Louie and the other prisoners in the camp are set free to return to their homes, Louie wanting to find Watanabe realises he has fled, back home in America, Louie kisses the ground and hugs his family. At the end of the film, a slideshow shows what happened to the real Louie Zamperini, he was married with two children, Phil survived and want on to marry his childhood sweetheart, Watanabe went into hiding for several years and evaded prosecution despite being listed in the top 40 most-wanted Japanese war criminals, and Louie lived out his devotion to God, forgiving his war-time captors and meeting many of them, Watanabe however refused to meet him. In 1998, Louie relived his time as a Olympian, running a leg of the Olympic Torch relay for the Winter Olympic Games in Nagano, four days before his 81st birthday, he died aged 97 on 2nd July 2014. Also starring Garrett Hedlund as LCDR John Fitzgerald, Jai Courtney as Charlton Hugh ""Cup"" Cupernell, Maddalena Ischiale as Louise Zamperini, Vincenzo Amato as Anthony and Luke Treadaway as Miller. It is a pretty amazing story, self- proclaimed regular guy, who competed in the Olympics, survived 47 days of exhaustion and starvation at sea, capture and torture, and being singled out for special punishment in POW camps, Jolie directs conventionally, but really draws you in with the visceral scenes of struggle, balanced with some lighter moments, a most interesting wartime drama based on a true story. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Sound Mixing and Best Sound Editing. Very good!"
" I am a sucker for anything Japanese packaged by western media.
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,7,"Saw this film like I usually do, in the background while doing something else. The film I must admit is forgettable, however, the tone, pace and excellent climatic moment was worth the price of admission. Few films grab my full attention and this film falls into that category of background noise. This film is more of a rental than an actual Blu-Ray purchase, but a must watch! Oh, how can I forget that this is a A. Jolie film, which was a big surprise for a casual movie watcher as myself. Kudos to females who make good products in a mostly male dominant market."
" Normal Epic Movie
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,7,(Flash Review)Go America! This movie certainly touches on American pride as many scenes illustrate American grit and determination in the face of adversity and fear. This movie follows the life of a young man who is fleet of foot enough to qualify for the Olympics as well as a strong- willed American soldier during WWII. The movie cuts between his childhood track days and his time as a soldier. There are many epic and well-produced battle scenes and Olympic settings yet leaves the viewer with a mix of bland and good emotions. Perhaps a lack any true surprises; you could see the plot arcs. Good acting from no-name actors. A few clich√© moments but they blending into the storyline just fine. Simply put: a very well done period piece; entertaining with emotional hooks yet failed to truly grip you.
" Really appreciated that
",2017-06-28 00:00:00,9,This movie is very fantastic thanks for the great performance of Jack O'Connell and Domhnall Gleeson. the writers wrote this movie in very fantastic way that make you cant stand up from your seat for any reason and the director make this movie a real wonderful one. I cant believe this story was real.
" Not a great movie
",2017-06-01 00:00:00,6,"This is based on a true story but it gets boring when they are being filmed stranded in the ocean for half an hour. In addition, its repetitious to watch Zamperini get punched by the general. The film has great actors but lacked so much potential to be good. I think overall this could benefit from a refilm, so I give this a 6.Rating: D-"
" Great True Story Of An American Hero
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,9,"Expertly directed by Angelina Jolie, ""Unbroken"" is the true story of U.S. soldier Louis Zamperini (played by Jack O'Connell) who survived weeks in a raft in the ocean after a plane crash, then is taken prisoner by Japanese soldiers and brutalized by the commander of the P.O.W. camp.A dangerous bombing run, an attack by Japanese Zeros, a search and rescue operation that turns into a disaster, the agonizing weeks of starvation and thirst in a life raft, flashbacks of Zamperini's troubled childhood and redemption, and the never ending days of torment in two Japanese P.O.W. camps give the audience insight to who this amazing person is and how he was able to survive the hardships during World War II.My most memorable, movie moment of ""Unbroken"" is the scene when O'Connell is in the life raft with two of his friends who also survived the plane crash; there is a wicked storm and each wave is as big as a three-story house. O'Connell grips tightly on the ropes attached to the raft, praying to God to help him make it through this horror.""Unbroken"" is a story made more powerful because it is true. Both the beauty and ugliness of the human spirit are shown, with the ""better angels of our nature"" winning.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
" The main characters are incredible; the others not as much. 10 stars!
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,10,"Because the story focuses on several main characters, and those characters are exceptional and tell this powerful true story in the most engrossing way possible, I give this film 10 stars. Admittedly, the home scenes (which start off the film) are slightly more bland and the characters are flatter but I think that make sense - they serve as a backdrop to Louie as an adult, as a runner, and into the military. The adult Louie is portrayed very well. The drama grips you - it made me cry at times, look away in horror, but mostly, this movie inspires me every day. It is a story of personal strength and a touch of faith, patriotism, family, friendship, and mostly, the triumph of the human spirit - not just as a clich√©, but as an incredible reality. This movie can be frightening but if you've got someone to hold onto while you watch, it's worth every second. You won't forget it because it won't leave you. It is powerful, awe-inspiring, and empowering. There is dawn at the end of night, beauty in a black coal mine. Be moved."
" A Soulless Film Devoid Of Any Meaning (And That's Really A Shame)
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,2,"When I read Laura Hillenbrand's ""Unbroken"" novel, it was a visceral experience...perhaps the most power non-fiction book I've read in my entire life. I'll never forget the name Louis Zamperini because of it. Sadly, this film adaptation of Louis' story tells only the most generic form of the story possible. All the real emotion and raw power of the story is excised.For a basic plot summary, ""Unbroken"" is the story of Louis Zamperini (Jack O'Connell), an Olympic runner who joins the military (eventually becoming a bombardier) to serve his country during World War II. While on a rescue mission, Louis' plane is shot down, forcing he and two fellow soldiers to spend over a month on a floating life-raft. They are finally rescued...by the Japanese military, who bring them to a camp occupied by a sadistic leader known as ""The Bird"" (Takamasa Ishihara). A trip through the coal mines also ensues, and Louis has multiple occasions where he could be nearing his mental and physical breaking point.The reason ""Unbroken"" fails so miserably, however, is that my brief description above is actually more exciting than anything that happens in the film itself. Basically, it is just a ""collection of events"" in a general sense. One thing happens, then another thing happens, and so on and so forth. The emotional underpinnings that tie all the events together in the novel are completely absent. I'm not exactly sure why this is (especially with a screenplay written by the usually-solid Coen Brothers), but it likely comes from the direction of second-time director Angelina Jolie. Either Jolie cut out the meat of the story due to her own personal biases, or she just isn't polished enough yet behind the camera to know exactly what she is doing. Either way, the result is a film without a soul.Also not helping this effort is that there is not a single truly great acting performance to be found. O'Connell as Louis is ""just okay"", but even then there doesn't seem to be much brewing underneath the surface of the performance. None of the supporting cast stick out whatsoever.One final glaring mistake: Jolie chooses to not cover (besides a few captions at the end) the end of Zamperini's life which, to me, is the most emotional hard-hitting part of the whole story. In case you haven't read the novel, this is where Louis struggles with terrible post-traumatic stress and basically hits rock bottom in alcoholism. After joining a Billy Graham crusade and giving his life to Christianity, he then makes a journey back to Japan to try and find ""The Bird"" and come to terms with his wartime experiences. To not show this in the film is a crime, IMHO.Viewing this movie was actually quite sad to me, as I know how much better it could have been made. If this version of the story is the only time you hear about Louis Zamperini, it will fade from your memory rather quickly, a shame considering how truly inspiring the man's story is. Instead of diving headfirst into the gritty, visceral issues that shape Louis' story, Jolie pulls too many punches and tries to create almost a family-film environment (released over the holidays, very little actual war violence compared to actual events, etc). This creates the most general movie experience possible, I have no respect for that approach to film-making."
" Never Lose Hope !
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,10,"I don't know why The Critics don't like this movie ?This movie is one of my favorites movies of all time, it's an excellent work, Angelina Jolie confirmed to all that she is a good director and she can also able to work on a large projects. On This Movie her directing was good but it doesn't make you dazzled so much big! BUT honestly the story was incredible, i felt the pain of Louis Zamperini's story who never give up, the Olympic championship hero who turned to a prisoner in world war II, such a wonderful story and painful at the same time, the cast was brilliant from jack a talented young man .. This movie give me hope, teach me to never give up and to always keep going, struggle, work hard, and never never lose hope !!This Film is worth seeing without any doubt !! <3"
" terrible, avoid - you have been warned
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,1,"It is rare that I stop watching a film part way through, very rare. I like to give all films a proper look but this one was so very bad I could not face any more clich√©d scenes. Just to let you know I stopped when Jack O'Connell's shouted at his fellow prisoners to hit him. I suppose it may have happened that way but Japanese POW's were by and large treated appallingly and usually starved so seeing well fed POW's doing this stretched credulity too far yet again, hence the switch off. For yet more unbelievable scenes see the (1) catching, killing, and eating a seabird & then vomiting (2) catching a shark and punching it to death (3) patching the shot up life raft and the shark attack ‚Äì all too ridiculous for words and so predictable. However, the worst thing about this film was its incredibly boring plot line. Louis Zamperini would probably be spinning in his grave over this turkey of a film. Take my advice avoid if you can."
" A triumph of the Human Spirit: Endurance and Perseverance
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,8,"""Unbroken"" is based on the excellent award-winning inspirational book (2010) by Laura Hillebrand, who has an eye for detail and description. It is a biography of the exciting life of Louis Silvie Zamperini of Torrance, California. This review includes several details that were omitted in the movie, included to clarify certain situations.Louis Zamperini (C.J. Valleroy as young Louie, Jack O'Connell in the title role) was restless and incorrigible as a Californian youth. Bullied, he was a juvenile delinquent. His older brother Pete (John D'Leo, Alex Russell), however, began to take more interest in him and became his mentor when Louie decided to run track. Pete rode his bike as Louie ran alongside him; later he ran far ahead. By high school Louie was setting state and national records: ""The Torrance Tornado"" became the fastest high school runner in US history. At age 19 he was already in the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games even though his body was still too young (undeveloped) to win a medal. Nevertheless he surprised even Hitler when he ran the fastest last lap of the 5,000-meter race in 56 seconds. Although robbed of his chance to break a world track record and run an under four-minute mile at the now-canceled 1940 Olympics, Louie continues to train in the vain hope that war will end by 1944, the next scheduled games. At film's beginning Louie is a flight lieutenant, a World War II bombardier on a B-24 Liberator that has just completed a successful raid on the Japanese-held island of Nauru in the south Pacific (1943). Although the airplane is shot up and crew members are wounded, the crew limps back successfully to base at Funafuti (now Tuvalu). The next mission involves rescuing a downed B-24 crew near the island of Palmyra. But Louie's crew is given ""The Green Hornet,"" an airplane that was not really fly-worthy. Sure enough an engine fails at an inopportune time and the plane has to be ditched over the vast Pacific Ocean (27 May 1943). There was no bail out because of the notorious shark-infested waters. Three of eleven crew members survive (Louie, Phil, Mac); they occupy two rubber rafts lashed together. One of them, friend Allen ""Phil"" Phillip (Domhnall Gleason) has a head wound. The scenes involving the albatross and sharks are as described in the book. Sharks constantly ran their bodies and fins along the raft bottom; the men could feel them (Yikes!). The book describes how more than one of the smaller sharks actually leaped onto the raft; a timely oar saved Louie's head. Then a twenty-foot long Great White slammed against the raft bottom, sending three men into the air. Luckily they landed atop the raft. Francis McNamara (""Mac,"" Finn Wittrock) eats all of the rationed chocolate, the only food. Eventually catatonic, he expires. In violation of the Geneva Convention, a Japanese Zero strafes them. After a record 47 harrowing days of thirst and starvation at sea on rubber rafts, the two survivors receive both good and bad news: they are rescued by the enemy. After interrogation at notorious Kwajalein, where prisoners were previously executed, Louie and Phil are eventually sent first to Ofuna Prisoner of War (POW) camp, then Omori in Tokyo Bay. Right away Louie is targeted by sadistic Japanese Corporal Watanabe (""The Bird,"" Takamasa Ishiara), who constantly beats him unmercifully. Although the Geneva Convention excludes officers from work details, many are forced into labor. Not working meant that one-half of the already meager rations were cut. Getting enough food to avoid starvation was problematic because of pilferage. Foods allocated for prisoners were stolen by both Japanese military and civilians and sold on the black market. Although Red Cross relief packages had been sent to the POWs, they too were confiscated. To avoid starvation, POWs had to do their own pilfering! (At war's end 1500 unopened Red Cross boxes were discovered locked in a prison storehouse!) The book further describes how Louie and other men were used as test subjects for experiments in biological / chemical warfare. Cloudy liquid forcibly injected into arms caused dizziness and nausea.Serendipity strikes Louie when Japanese intelligence discovers that American military has mistakenly assumed his death. Knowing that the capture of an American Olympic athlete has propaganda value, the Japanese allow Louie to radio broadcast a harmless message that he is alive and well. After that Louie gets a nice meal in a Japanese cafeteria. But Louie is soon approached by high level Japanese civilians, who want him to disparage America over airwaves. As Louie cannot act in good conscience, it is back to POW camp with Watanabe. Towards war's end, Louie is transferred to the grimy coal barges on Japan's west coast (Naeotsu). War's end and homecoming cannot come soon enough (1945). The instincts that helped Louie endure his mutinous youth had helped keep him alive in despairing situations. Although his post-traumatic stress disorder and religious conversion were skipped, closing captions briefly explain that Louie married and later returned to Japan to forgive his captors for their cruel treatment. The exception was Watanabe, the Bird; he was assumed dead. Not until 1997 did Louie discover that Watanabe was still alive; he died in 2003. The ending shows the real life footage of Zamperini as an old man running the torch for the Winter Olympics (1998), not far from his old POW camp. Louie lived until 2014, dying just a few months before picture release.Although the movie doesn't cover Louie's post-war years, it is still entertaining. It was nominated for three Academy Awards and won several others. One should not expect the picture to be as detailed as the book. Perhaps the feature could have been extended by, say, thirty minutes; Angelina Jolie directed. The screenplay is decent enough and Roger Deakins' cinematography is excellent. Jack O'Connell plays the tough Italian wonderfully and is inspiring as a man constantly beaten down but who mentally defeats his enemies."
" Good
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,8,"Unbroken is a movie directed by Angelina Jolie. It's based on the novel Unbroken, written by Laura Hillenbrand. This novel is about the trials, and adversity in the life of Louis Zamperini, a POW during World War II. The movie as well focuses on Louis Zamperini's journey, what he went through, and his story. The movie begins with Louis in a plane with a few other men. While in the plane there are periodic flashbacks giving the viewer insight into Louis life before the war. These scenes are helpful, giving the viewer a taste of the overall picture. However they can be quite confusing, switching back and forth from past to present. Once the plane has landed the movie goes onto explain Louis' childhood, his relationship with his family, and his childhood struggles. After learning about Louis life and family the movie goes into the overall story of his experience during World War II. As a whole, the movie reflected the book quite well. The characters and structure were pretty much identical. One of the differences between the two, is that the book begins with Louis' childhood and works its way up to the war, while the movie jumps between past and present, before getting into the larger part of the story. Another difference in the book is that when the story is coming to an end, there is much more talk of his family, and what happens in his life after the war. The movie did not cover this as well. The movie ends with a few pictures of Louis family and friends but nothing is really mentioned in detail about his life after the story. This movie is a very inspirational, true story of survival under the worst conditions imaginable. Louis' story really makes the viewers, and readers realize that life for us is not all that hard. This movie is very well executed and is very engaging to anyone who views it."
" After almost 80 years still a unipolar view of Japanese
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,7,"I thought it was overall a good movie with a fairly accurate portrayal of the history. I have not read the book and was more interested in the POW story, which is an interest of mine. One thing that often comes out of POW stories is the intensely personal experience without any context given to the enemy. Most of the guards in these camps were either Korean, Taiwanese or, Japanese rejects including American born Japanese who weren't trusted. These Nisei often had a chip on their shoulder because of the discrimination they experienced. The non Japanese guards were also looked down on and got slapped around quite a bit. Slapping subordinates was part of Japanese military discipline and so they didn't see anything wrong with doing it to prisoners. If the prisoners didn't take it the guard lost face and the situation escalated. There actually were plenty of individual acts of humanity and kindness from guards which never seems to make it to film. The casualty rates among POWs were brutal, so overall it is not wrong to portray the camps as nasty inhumane places. Many of the deaths were due to malnutrition. Again it must be remembered that the Japanese were reduced to boiling grass towards the end - starvation of the civilian population was a war tactic caused by bombing and sinking of shipping. Finally, the movie does acknowledge towards the end the Tokyo fire bombings. But the scale is played way down. 200,000 civilians burned to death on the night of 9th March 1945 alone.

",2017-01-05 00:00:00,10,"Every so often a film comes along that inspires me to overcome all challenges and energizes me with an almost divine zest for life. Unbroken is one of those films. It's heroic without being campy, it's tragic without being grotesque, and it's historic without being too detailed. It depicts the worst human suffering through true story; a story so overburdened with pain and trauma that most filmmakers would make it unbearable to watch, but somehow Angelina and the Coen brothers manage to keep it highly engaging the whole time. I would recommend it to anyone, especially those who are suffering from the worst illness of all: privilege. It's a punch in the face and a reminder of what matters in life."
