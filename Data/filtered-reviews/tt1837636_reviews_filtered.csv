" Shokran, Herzog, but..
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,4,"Herzog brags in all of his relatively lengthy interviews about how well-read he is, speaks God knows how many languages. But when he made an attempt at the Middle East he ended with something that is, at best, a bizarre mix of Lawrence of Arabia and the English Patient. Merely a fantasy of the average *well-read* German tourist, who got enchanted by Moroccan sand dunes, and possibly hashish.The real story of Bell, together with her real contributions to the genesis of the modern Middle East, have all dissipated under Herzog's excessive obsession with her romantic life. Bell is almost completely unknown to most people, outcasted somewhere in the shadow of T.E Lawrence. This movie failed to accredit her voice and her legacy.There is some honest attempts to capture the beauty of the desert, that I can give to Herzog, but nothing more. As a final note, and as an Arab, it was incredibly awkward to watch a bunch of Moroccan actors, speaking in perfect Moroccan dialect, when they were supposed to be playing Arab Bedouins!"
" Interesting fact
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,7,"It's hardly known but Bell, a significant historical personage, neatly drew from memory the lines of what became the modern Middle East. The lines, entirely arbitrary and not reflective of tribal relations, ethnicity, language, or religious sect, were designed to clarify the rolls of the British, French, and Russian empires in 1916. Her map was attached to the Sykes-Picot Agreement. She was the only woman accepted as an almost equal by Kings Saud and Faisal of Arabia."
" People are being too critical
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,7,"Moat of the reviews on this movie are being too harsh. People are always upset about historical mistakes and things of that nature and they may have some right to be, but in the end its a movie and its meant to entertain and take us away. In my opinion this was a decent movie with good acting by Nicole Kidman and an interesting story. The setting, scenery and soundtrack took me away and by the time it was over i felt like i had gone on adventures as well. If you want an exact portrate of Gertride Bell's life read a book or watch a documentary, if you want to be entertained by a good film, i'd reccomend this."
" Werner Herzog misses a trick.
",2020-12-09 00:00:00,3,"Herzog directs romantic tosh instead of the strong woman epic this film demanded. Gertrude Bell, best looked up on Google to discover her achievements, particularly her work for the British government during the first world war in the middle east, was a remarkable woman. Nicole Kidman is also a remarkable actress but is badly let down by Herzog here by making her something completely alien to the Bell I looked up. Kidman needed the proscetics she had in The Hours for a start to at least give her something of Bell's appearance, instead she just looks beautiful like she did in Cold Mountain. Robert Pattinson is a joke as T E Lawrence at 6'1"" where Lawrence was 5'5"" and again looks nothing like him. There is no sense at all of what Bell had done to warrant the responsibility given to her by the government. Just soppy love interests fabricated out of the two men she had attachments to. A good film should have been made out of Bell but this isn't it, plus it's tedious and boring as nothing much happens. Shame, a trick missed. It's more like an Arabian travelogue."
" Dialogue so cheesy it is near impossible to bear...
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,4,"I mean, honestly. What was Herzog doing when he wrote this? Was he over excited on fizzy drinks and playing with barbie dolls acting out fantasies? Because that is what watching this feels like.The dialogue is so unbearably cheesy it's painful to sit through. And so silly it makes you laugh. I am making particular reference to Kidman's and Franco's characters. The way they speak and that weird whispery wanting to be whimsical way he always talks to her has me sitting there in confusion to whether the character is having a stroke or having her on or something. But then it turns out no. That's just how they're talking and I just finding myself laughing and cringeing in despair.The whole thing is full of stupid whimsical over acting as if they're all on some sort of hallucinogen. Touching faces because they're mushy, saying stupid things like ""I sit up there when I'm lonely and I'm always lonely :("" for her to then go ""aww"". Going up a tower like a pair of kids to find a vulture and he goes ""I wanna kiss you"" for then to slightly move towards he and then run off into the dust like a pair of 5 year olds. It's stupid. And who thought that girl crying at the dinner table was a good idea? It's stupid.I mean, honestly. I only managed to get through 35 minutes before it got too dumb to bear. I went into it thinking it'll have a Lawrence of Arabia feel or feeling of ""The English Patient"" to it. No. It's just gormless and stupid."
" Will the Real Herzog Stand Up
",2020-07-22 00:00:00,1,"It is beyond belief how a supposedly accomplished director and documentarian could take a character like Gertrude Bell, in a land like the Middle East, during a pivotal time in history, and turn it into a mere costume romance, White Savior (I suspect she was more the problem than any solution for the region, like the men) and totally blind orientalist film which mashes dates up unashamedly (""historical"" my foot). It's definitely a chick flick (massively boring one!) with little meat at all. What a great insult to trivialize Bell, who, in spite of her machinations in the region, was apparently a real outlier in her time. Even painting her with the same evil brush as the men would have been far more interesting and realistic. Does Herzog (and Hollywood - no, don't answer that) really think that women only care about romance? That we'll sigh and turn it off if there is anything intellectual or interesting whatsoever? Please give us more credit. I'd rather see what made Bell tick, why Middle Eastern men welcomed and perhaps respected her (besides wisely realizing they needed to network the powers that be), and more realistic conversations, not just, ""I am honored..."". This film begs comparisons to Lawrence of Arabia, not in scope, but T. E. Lawrence is a character here and was a ""friend"" (not sure how to describe him) of Bell's. Yet even Lawrence was somewhat trivialized by director David Lean in Lawrence of Arabia, in favor of scope, 70mm, and desert romance. But this film doesn't have the outrageously, gloriously filmed desert, Omar Sharif, or the amazing overacting of Peter O'Toole to save it.Herzog is apparently blind to the realities and ethnicities of the Middle East, correct languages (would a Brit speak French in Britain?), and on and on. While there are actors of Middle Eastern descent, their ethnicities don't always line up correctly with the region or character (and Herzog, as an experienced documentarian, should know this and care about all these things). Not that any actor is unable to play any part, but it's an historical film (or purports to be) and this is a symptom of a disrespectful disease in film re non-Western characters and actors. And of course, there are European actors playing Middle Eastern characters. Not a lot, and mostly incidental, but the Shop Keeper is very European and dubbed, and quite embarrassing. Hard to take the historical aspects of the film seriously after his appearance.This is no low budget flick, with great locations, if not claustrophobic, cinematography, with wonderful costumes, yet Herzog turns it into a movie of the week which could have been shot on the back lot. Kidman, who I normally love, just phones it in here and cannot save this pile. She is one note throughout, and not displaying the range and charisma I have come to expect from her. She is not a good simpering romantic and to cast her in such a flacid role was a mistake. Herzog should have just hired a young (we are supposed to think Kidman is 20+ yrs younger), shallow, actress and saved some money."
" Forget the history, watch the film
",2020-07-02 00:00:00,7,"Forewarned by the numerous negative reviews here I did not read up on Bell before watching.
There are two basic approaches to writing historical fiction. One way is to research the known history and insert what you need to make a story of it without introducing contradictions or absurdities. The other is to use what you like from the record, ignore the rest, then invent whatever you fancy. Herzog seems to have taken the second course. What is on the screen may be a travesty of the facts, but it does hold together, though a bit too melodramatic to fully convince.
The acting is excellent, Kidman presents Bell as a complex, admirable, and totally credible character. Was she like that? I don't know, and within the context of the film it doesn't matter.
The story is episodic, there is little to link the episodes other than Bell's love of Arabia and her need to explore it. But each episode is well written and watchable, even if a little stagey. Was Herzog trying to evoke some earlier era of film making? Only a student of film history could tell, but it does have a kind of Fifties feel.
The settings are magnificent, the sense of place works well, both the grand scale of the country and the rather small scale of the human occupation of it. There may be more accuracy here than Herzog is given credit for.
Trouble has been taken over detail, but I did spot the same rebab player in two very distant locations."
" Botched Up Great Biography
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,4,"I had high expectations because it's a Herzog movie but I was utterly disappointed 30 minutes past the film but I still decided to go through the entire movie to see. The only good thing I can say about the movie is the cinematography but the editing messed it up as well. As a huge Kidman fan, I expected no less. Technically she did what she could based on the horrible script she was given to work on. I know she always goes by the director instead of the script but Herzog failed to deliver an average film. Two hours would not be enough to present the adventures of Gertrude Bell. They could have focused on how Bell became the ""Queen"" of the desert and how she won the hearts of the people of the desert despite religious barrier but this was not presented to us. After every visit by Bell to a tribe or community , the film will suddenly jump to the next adventure of Bell. The 36 minutes devoted to the relationship of Bell and Cadogan was unnecessary and that one is already a red flag of bad writing. What was Herzog thinking when he hired James Franco? His English accent is offensive to say the least. After seeing the movie, I realized that a 5-part mini-series would be fitting to tell the story of Ms. Bell. I would give this 1 had it not been for the effort of Kidman to elevate the poor material even if she failed to do so."
" Nicole Kidman (I swear, she never ages....)
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,8,"""I doubt there is anyone in the world so happy as I am now. You are baptized of the desert, and there is no other salvation for you.""Biopic about an extraordinary noblewoman Gertrude Bell who of her own free and unshakable will explored the deserts and visited the tribes of the Middle East during the early 1900s, gaining such intimate knowledge of their leaders, customs, and conflicts that she became the West's leading authority when England began drawing territorial lines following World War I. The opening 45 minutes could have been condensed as it details Gertrude's relocation at her pleading request from England to Teheran and her first love, an undersecretary at the embassy. This portion is important to her story but it's a stretch for even Nicole Kidman to convince as a couple decades younger while her love interest James Franco seems ill-fitting in both his attire and English accent. Once she begins exploring the Arab world so different from our own is when the movie magic happens. Werner Herzog is no stranger to filming in extremely challenging environments, and the cinematography of various remote locations of sweeping deserts, treacherous salt flats, and dizzying canyons are spectacular, even rivaling the benchmark shots from David Lean's 'Lawrence of Arabia.' Speaking of Lawrence, Robert Pattinson is surprisingly effective and more brashly candid than Peter O'Toole's messianic portrayal. I'm not surprised that I'd never heard of Gertrude Bell as much of history is indeed ""his story"" and this film is a valuable eye-and-brain-filling cinematic addition to ""herstory"".""I'm here to inform you of my plans to travel to the Djebel Druze.""
""You can't be serious.""
""Yes, I most certainly am.""
""No one has traveled to the Druze in decades.""
""So it's about time."""
" It gets boring fast
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,5,"Would you have rather seen Florence of Arabia than the classic 1962 epic with Peter O'Toole? Then check out Nicole Kidman in Queen of the Desert, where she explores the great, beautiful desert. Ironically, T.E. Lawrence is a character in this movie, played by Robert Pattinson. There are so many wonderful things you'll get to see if you rent this movie, including the breathtaking scenery of Morocco, filmed on location, archaeological treasures from centuries past, and James Franco with a British accent.Let's get the cutie-pie out of the way, since he's not in the movie for very long. He gives all the women in the audience a fair warning when he romances Nicole and proposes to her with an ancient coin: after slitting the coin in half, he tells her that they'll each take one piece and if one of them dies the survivor will keep the entire coin. So ladies, don't get too attached to him.After the eye candy has left the screen, Nicole traipses around the desert and asserts herself as a political asset among many conflicting groups and nations. If you know who Gertrude Bell is, you'll probably be really interested in seeing this biopic, but if you're not in love with camels and the desert, you'll get bored fast. As she meanders around in the sun, the plot meanders with her, so you'll have to pay close attention if you don't want scenes to blend into one another. I liked the first half better than the second, but it's not hard to guess why.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. Many scenes are filmed with a slightly shaky camera that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!"""
" A bit baffling...
",2020-02-18 00:00:00,7,"...inasmuch as; here was a real-life woman who did so many extraordinarily adventurous things/exploits at a time, historically, when few men did the same, and who left a contentious legacy, who was by all accounts and standards exceptionally intelligent, and yet the story told here is almost devoid of drama, and we never gain any insight into what this astonishing (some might say, 'bizarre') person/woman was actually thinking at any given moment, besides extreme boredom during the opening scenes in her native England. Furthermore, the dramas of others' whose lives she affects are left entirely open-ended; her unfortunate cousin, love-sick to the point of stalker-like madness for the man who then proposes to her instead - and then kills himself in apparent despair when his beloved and intended goes home for 9 months and doesn't come back - the cameo young servant at the consulate in Tehran who hands her a letter from the mailroom while confessing that he would lay down his life for a woman like her, the faithful guide/sherpa on whom she totally depends during her long desert wanderings/travels and who has by her own admission saved her life many times...what becomes of all of them, we wonder? And are we really to believe that, having consented to write him many passionate and ardent love-letters after he promised her to 'put things in order' with his wife but returning to find out that (a) he hasn't, and (b) he has enlisted to fight in a fierce war on a dangerous front, that this strong-willed personality would meekly say ""I see...""?!? Unusual though she was, by her writings we know her to have been an emotional poetic person as well as a shrewd intellect, with plenty of personal opinions, so we cannot blame Nicole Kidman for a vacuous performance but must surely place the blame firmly at the feet of the director. While Herzog has always avoided Hollywood cliches and pat conclusions or summations, in this film he goes too far with his open-endedness and leaves the viewer with far more questions than answers. I began Googling about Gertrude about a third of the way through the movie because I needed to understand better about her background, to try to gauge her motivations to various situations, but by the end of a protracted fest of beauteous desert shots plus mysterious Middle-Eastern music I remained basically baffled. Plus, Pattison's portrayal of T.E. Lawrence was tediously immature, which after watching Lean's famous 'Lawrence of Arabia' starring Peter O'Toole's perpetually shell-shocked hero was a bit indigestible. I do applaud the impetus to put a proper historical frame of reference on this long-overlooked political player and explorer who was also female, and I did enjoy the joyfulness of the (brief!) love scenes between James Franco's character and the (presumably) still very young Gertrude (Gertie? Apparently not - nobody dared to use any nicknames on this imposing person, so it seems...), and of course I very much appreciated the equality of Middle-Eastern characters juxtaposed with the then-colonial and frequently superiority-deluded British, though I was a tad troubled by a distinctly suspicious and hostile glance directly at the camera by an Arab merchant in a marketplace which made me wonder whether the crew had forgotten to get permission from people not paid to be extras?! Hmmm, more bafflement..."
" Much Better Than Expected
",2020-01-12 00:00:00,9,"I really like this film. The combination of a brilliant director with (perhaps) the greatest actress alive (in my opinion) is a wonderful situation. Werner Herzog and Nicole Kidman turn this 128 minutes into a truly epic film. It seems much longer, which is always a good thing for me. The fact it is based in truth is the best part of all. A must see film."
" Could have been so much better
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,3,"I feel that with so much to tell us about the life of Gertrude Bell far too much time was spent on her romantic episodes. Although they are vital to the story it took an hour for her to be leaving Great Britain for her first post in Terhan.
A few paragraphs written before the closing credits did not do justice to what she achieved.
I was so disappointed after wanting to see this film for so long."
" Wener Herzog Sells Out
",2019-12-24 00:00:00,3,"And - since he's both the writer and director - can't point the accusing finger at anyone else. All the camera angles in the world won't make Nicole Kidman look convincingly young, and I feel sorry for anyone stuck with James Franco. But they needed names to finance the picture - and I guess the financiers weren't all that interested in historical accuracy, either, since there are scenes that are simply unbelievable as well as having no basis in fact. And what an empty premise in the first place: that a woman strikes out on her own because of a lost love. It's because of this stupid romance that the first half hour is completely wasted. The film is an insult to the memory of a remarkable person, and Herzog should be ashamed of himself. We know he's capable of so much better."
" Undistinguished Biopic!
",2019-12-08 00:00:00,5,"I have to be blunt. Reading Gertrude Bell's Wikipedia entry arguably provides more thrills than watching Werner Herzog's misfire of a biopic. Although a contemporary and, as this film suggests, a likely friend of TE Lawrence, Queen of the Desert, doesn't even come remotely close to telling Bell's story with the same sort of grandeur and vision that David Lean achieved with Lawrence of Arabia.Bell led a life of adventure and achievement, in a range of diverse locations and across a variety of disciplines that Herzog doesn't really even attempt to explore. Hell, the woman even had an interesting death (as far as deaths can be interesting I suppose). He only focuses his cameras on Bell's middle eastern travels. But then makes the mistake of trying to define much of Bell's life through a couple of failed and unfulfilled love encounters with men associated with diplomatic posts. A great deal of onscreen time is spent in various embassies and at different functions, that I'm afraid I consider time just wasted.When Herzog finally decides to turn to the desert, we are presented with some breath-taking, but often quite brief scenes. We see her begin to interrelate with a number of Bedouin tribes in abrupt, fairly forgettable exchanges, which never succeed in portraying how she ended up being such an influentially historical figure in the region, whose reputation rivalled that of Lawrence himself. Then there are factual inaccuracies that Herzog allows/makes for no real artistic objectives. Basic things such as her being confined to Ha'il for 11 days, not over 3 weeks as mentioned in the dialogue. Occasional years and dates are mentioned onscreen, but shouldn't be taken too seriously. Using the film's timeline, the film appears to begin in 1902, when an obviously young Gertrude first achieves her ambition of travelling east due to her influential father. The only trouble with that is, by this time she was actually 34 and had made copious trips to the Middle East.Queen of the Desert was both a critical failure and a rather huge commercial flop.
It's such a shame that $36 million should be wasted on a movie that doesn't really begin to explore what made this independent, intelligent woman ahead of her times tick."
" Queen of Nonsense
",2019-10-25 00:00:00,2,".. and show-offs. Long time ago I started to think it can become a habit for some actors to show off in all their movies. After watching this total waste of time (and effort, and money for sure) I know now that my earlier thoughts are correct.What a boring pure nonsense, queen of nothing."
" Herzog's storyline style
",2019-10-05 00:00:00,8,"Having followed Herzog's career, this is a half fiction half documentary movie which goes on with his style, open screenplays, risking a lot and trusting the soundtrack, the actresses and actors and the emotions... the result is a beautiful movie, maybe not as deep as Nosferatu or Aguirre, but crafted."
" Sand is coarse and gets everywhere.
",2019-07-10 00:00:00,7,"Well, I'd never heard of Gertrude Bell before watching this movie, so I learned a little something - assuming that the movie was rooted in some truth. Nicole Kidman plays the adventurer in the early 20th century who wandered the Middle East, thumbed her nose at her native England's attempts to co-opt her for their own purposes, and tried to educate herself about the people, places, and history of the region. The movie is beautiful to look at, but it's really Kidman's commanding performance as the headstrong Gertrude (yet another instance of a bored English upper-cruster) who loves and loses and loves and loses, sometimes with the assistance of men, often without. Gertrude's approach to dealing with the various Bedouin tribes is to employ compassion and eschew condescension and imperialism, and her efforts pay off. James Franco and Robert Pattinson are on board as fellow go-getters, but neither really sticks out. Which is seriously fine, as this is definitely Kidman's show all the way. You can think of her as a female Lawrence of Arabia, but you might still be shortchanging her - at least Gertrude didn't have delusions of importance or grandeur, at least not according to this movie."
" A crime against film
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,1,"Now I know why Queen of the Desert only has 6 likes on Facebook. It's. That. Bad. Werner Herzog took a remarkable woman and reduced her to nothing more than her love life.Gertrude Bell was so influential that she helped draw the boundaries of modern Iraq, but you'd never know it from watching the movie.It's a crime against film. Want to learn more about Gertrude Bell? Read the book."
" Phony Story About a Brilliant Woman
",2019-05-25 00:00:00,3,"This woman did everything, and she did it without whining to crowds about victimhood or entitlements. Very few people do I hold such a high regard for as I do with this woman. Earth-shakers and human volcanoes only come around once in a lifetime. Their spectacular life's stories are given to Hollyweird and some goof's poetic license takes over and tints their heroic tales with fable. For that reason, I was so upset with their second hate-version of 'Steve Job.' Sadly the same I feel has happened to the trailblazer, Gertrude Bell. What I've read about her, tells me she deserves better than this. She was no squeamish Hollyweird whining imposter, she was real. This strong human had an exciting and interesting life and this life should stand on its own. People like her are very rare. Well directed and have always liked Nicole Kidman."
" Travelers Guide to the Arabian Lands
",2019-05-23 00:00:00,6,"(Flash Review)During global strife in the Middle East, the British government strategizes a plan to create order and boundaries between nations. Gertrude Bell, coming from high British status chooses to leave that life and in order to wander through the beauty of the desert and making friends with people in every nation and soaking up their ""poetry of life."" She made countless contacts, made genuine friendships and gained trust throughout unstable lands while reporting back to British officials. This film was picturesque in a minimal way and it really showed her love for the land and the cultures yet I wish the film had more boldly shown the true impact and unique influence she had rather than leaving it to factoids at the end. It also lacked any sense of drama or true challenge of her adventures."
" If you're looking to power nap
",2019-04-25 00:00:00,3,"This movie was a huge snore fest. I kept waiting for something... anything really to happen to justify the time spent watching it... that did happen. Even the scenery was bland. Deserts of sand blowing with eroding stone are not my idea of break taking scenery. As for the romanticism that also did not happen. The character building just wasn't there that would make you ""feel"" passionate about the characters. As a matter of fact I felt contempt for how shallow the characters were.I gave it a 3 simply because I like Nicole Kidman and I do think her acting was on par but if she wasn't in the movie it would be the only zero I've ever given."
" Nicole Kidman gives a brilliant performance
",2019-04-22 00:00:00,8,"Very nice movie. It moved along a little slow in some parts, nice storyline."
" Great if it were the first part of a trilogy...
",2019-04-19 00:00:00,5,.... they are missing her greatest contributions ... who ever dreamed up this ending was probably hoping to continue the story. Terrible as it is a stand-alone!
" Larry of Arabia without the excitement
",2019-04-19 00:00:00,5,"Long, subdued, and intensely boring. Gertrude Bell's life must have been more interesting than this film; otherwise she would have died of boredom at a very young age. Beautifully filmed and well acted, but it's over 2 hours long and very little happens besides Bell riding dromedaries hither and yon, talking with this guy and the other. For some odd reason, none of the foreign language conversations are subtitled, so you spend extended times having no idea what anyone is talking about! Every man she falls in love with kills himself. Maybe it was boredom."
" Ishtar flashbacks!!!
",2019-04-12 00:00:00,1,"Watching this unrealistic and silly movie was painful at best. The cinematography was absolutely beautiful. Everything else was horrible. I started getting Ishtar flashbacks and if I'm not mistaken, Ishtar was rated one of the worst movies of all time."
" Beautiful film, amazing story, brilliant acting
",2019-04-09 00:00:00,10,"This is a very beautiful story, the rating should be at least 9 stars.
I wish more people were able to appreciate beauty. Thank you to the film crew for bringing this beautiful film to us, much appreciated!"
" A fairly pathetic flick
",2019-01-28 00:00:00,1,"Quite a pathetic flick. Replete with animal abuse. Oversentimental. Lacks intellectuality. Feels rather like a low-budget production for which the director managed to score some world-class names. To top it all, the flick is boring.
The only positive thing about is Gertude's depiction as a non-mudshark - the accuracy of her sexual worth is, obviously, difficult to verify, although I would argue that a proper woman has nothing to seek in the parts of the world she spent most of her arguably adult (adult to what extent - again - is disputable) life.
Either way, this is a sort of a movie that will appeal to lowbrows. If you're into ""The Pianist"", the ""Barry Lyndon"", the ""Farinelli"", the ""Atonement"", ""The Reader"",""Les MIserables"",""Alone in Berlin"",""Disobedience"", ""The Shape of Water"", etc. - you'll find this flick annoyingly un-cerebral.Could it be worse? Yes. With even more animal abuse, with a miscegenation-pushing propaganda (which invariably and nauseatingly involves a White Woman and a nonwhite, including arab/ muslim, male or males) - sure, ti could be much worse yet. But as it is, it is still rubbish. A waste of 2-odd hours of your life."
" Just stupid

We say Farsi only in our native language just like Germans say Deustch as the name of their language!
Alexander was a junky who attacked Persia and raped Persian womens and childrens and burned Persepolis and the whole city and took life of many peoples but these two lovely birds were in Persia and they shared the coin of the Alexander *The great* to show their love!!!

" A dull overproduced piece
",2019-01-04 00:00:00,4,"The film that attempts to tell a story of a great woman (instead of a great man) falls into defining her through her relationships with men. Though the film has some good visuals, its screenplay is dull and characthers banal and without depth. Much more could have had been done with the subject matter but the end result is too screched that it leaves a meaningless expression at the end."
" An epic portrait of Gertrude Bell, an English explorer, polymath, and astute political analyst of the Middle East.
",2019-01-03 00:00:00,8,"This may be Werner Herzog's most conventional film, but its mostly untold true story knows what it means for a woman to choose a life of adventure and intellect."
" At its best At it's worst
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,5,At its best .... at its worst it's just a boring plotless film.
" Surprisingly Good
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,7,"I am surprised that I had never heard of this movie until The Movie Channel showed it this month. It must've had a very short release here in the U.S. To get the complete story, see the documentary ""Letters From Baghdad"" (2016), narrated by Tilda Swinton, as Gertrude Bell, which was shown on PBS, and was so good, that I didn't even want to watch this one. I did enjoy this one, in spite of their trying to insert romances with men that were less than portrayed. She was truly an independent individual !"
" Remake of Queen of the Desert Necessary
",2018-11-10 00:00:00,2,"As a T E Lawrence and Gertrude Bell lay historian, this film was a real disappointment, miscast top to bottom and did not reflect reality of Miss Bell's challenging exploration of Saudi Arabia and the Fertile Crescent i.e. Iraq, Iran, and parts of Syria, almost too slick and clean to accurately reflect life on the ground as a very early European explorer of these regions. Multiple language linguist i.e. dead & living languages, archaeologist, cartographer, artist, poet, letter correspondent, equestrian, expert marks person, cultured, cultivated and supported both financially and spiritually by her father. Oh, what a bloody shame, eh>"
" Truly Understated!!
",2018-11-02 00:00:00,9,"Such a piece of art. No, there isn't much (if any) action but the beauty of the scenes and script and overall plot drive the movie. Nicole Kidman is simply amazing and it is her character's story, as well as the story of the Middle East, that compels you to watch. If you want brilliant and beautiful yet long, watch it.

" What a beautiful movie
",2018-10-06 00:00:00,10,This movie will leave you blissful and hopeful after watching it so beautiful. Made me want to know more about the history.
" A waste of time movie
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,1,"Hard to watch, boring and almost painful. Kidman comes across as spoiled child and not as the serious soul searching explorer."
" Worth watching
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,6,"An okay movie about a very important woman, the attempt to tell her story is important, as was her possible role in history"
" A Bold Woman Behind the Scenes of Middle Eastern History
",2018-08-22 00:00:00,8,"Be forewarned: This is not an action movie. However, it is about bold actions taken by a person who did amazing things at a critical time in world history. It would be an amazing feat today if someone did what Gertrude Bell did BUT, keep in mind, she did these incredible things over 100 years ago. Yes, the pace of the movie may seem slow but I interpreted that as fitting with the desert where things do not tend to happen quickly. The pace is like the poetry of the desert that Gertrude speaks of. So, if you want superheroes, sex, and aliens, look elsewhere. If you like stories about little known aspects of history and a focus on someone who was behind the scenes as world-changing events occurred, this movie is perfect for you."
" Poorly executed characters secenes and lowering accomplishments of Gertrude Bell's
",2018-07-18 00:00:00,5,"She was a woman with so many accomplishments when women were next to nothing. In the film all you hear about is single lines stating this accomplishments and the rest is she doing childish argues to go somewhere new and let man save her from everything and show her everything!!! The small periods of romance are so hytened in the movie that left no place for her personality and it seems like they tried to show that she did everything for her lost loves!
I am not much of historian or anything but as an Iranian I am sure what they show as Tehran (Iran) was totally wrong. You see people in Moroccan/Syrian/Arabic clothing which definitely does not belong to Tehran, you hear people speaking Arabic then you hear actors and actresses trying to read poems in Farsi. It is even a pity that they did not learn a few lines of farsi and pronounce everything with a not very accurate translation (as far as I could read the texts) even locations featured in the movie are nothing like Tehran, the palm trees that you see in some scenes can not be found by hundreds of kilometer from Tehran which means that the love birds cannot go for a short ride to such places. 
You also see a ton of actors and actresses that enter the plot and they have such a short appearance that their dialogues become silly. Take the 1 year love story of the daughter of consul in Tehran that ends with her crying, leaving dinner table and nothing more... I cannot get why this was necessary and many of Gertrude Bell's achievements were not! Was it necessary to see that the man she loved was loved by other women? What does it tell us? Should we compare her personality to a spoiled teenager who is only care about fun and shopping? Do not let me start with Robert Pattinson's role! Who chose him to be Lowrance and how silly he was depicted here...
I really don't understand! 5 star to me was for them trying and some how some accurate scenes..."
" Stultifying
",2018-07-07 00:00:00,3,"Anyone would think that Werner Herzog has lost his power to compel with this and the disappointing BAD LIEUTENANT: PORT OF CALL NEW ORLEANS. QUEEN OF THE DESERT is a lengthy biopic of British explorer Gertrude Bell, but in Herzog's hands it turns into a tawdry, drawn-out story bogged down by romance and glossing over the interesting parts of Bell's life. The first mistake is in casting a fiftysomething Nicole Kidman in a role that should have been played by a woman thirty years younger. I don't care how much plastic surgery Kidman has had, but she doesn't look or act like a young intrepid woman at all. Kidman delivers a typically superficial performance, concentrating on her note-perfect accent over anything approaching depth or insight. She's bland. The best actor here is Robert Pattinson as Lawrence of Arabia, but he has very limited screen time. The rest is a blur of well-shot desert landscapes and stultifying human drama, and I'm afraid it's my worst Herzog viewing yet. Perhaps he should stick to the great documentaries he still makes, like INTO THE INFERNO."
" Why?
",2018-06-21 00:00:00,6,"That is the unanswered question here. Why? Why exactly was Gertrude Bell so fascinated with the desert states she explored. She rode camels a lot. She walked a lot. She appeared to be tall. All superficial things about this character. But we all that camel riding and walking got boring after a while...and not a very long while at that. Clearly there must have been a fascinating woman there...but you'd never know it by this film. 128 minutes is not too long for most films...but it was too long here.That's not to say the film has no redeeming qualities. Oddly enough, I can't stand James Franco. But here I found his performance very engaging...although it took me a while to realize who he was. Of course, as one of the good things about the movie, we only see him in the early scenes of the movie.Nicole Kidman did a fine job as Gertrude Bell. That wasn't the problem with the movie. The problem was the script and the directing. The most interesting casting may have been that as Robert Pattinson as ""Lawrence of Arabia""; quite interesting...but he's no Peter O'Toole. And I found it interesting to see Jenny Agutter, who I lost track of since 1976 in ""Logan's Run"" (I know I just dated myself).The film wasn't bad enough to turn off, but it did take me several sittings to wade through the plodding plot. It's a shame...I have a feeling there was a fascinating story here."
" Garbage movie about a terrible person.
",2018-05-23 00:00:00,1,"Herzog does history; and history loses. 
The malignant schemes of Churchill, Lawrence, and Bell, which would fuel many of the problems of the modern Middle East, are seen as somehow ennobled simply on the basis of gender balance; when it was Bell, who once described Shi'ites as ""animals"", who may have been the worst of them (though it's a tough call).
And, as others have noted, the dates are all wrong. 
Dreadful, Werner; political maneuvering at its worst."
" A Victorian era woman rises above her station!
",2018-04-30 00:00:00,8,"This interesting Herzog film tells the viewer that ""some"" Victorian women wanted to do other than the status quo!Gertrude Bell was such a woman, she was one of the first to attend and advanced in scholarship FAR beyond her classmates..Women simply didn't get advanced education in Victorian era!While some posters have vented that this movie is simply about a ""rich bored girl"" that travelled the middle eastern areas, history shows that Bell, along with T.E. Lawrence knew and understood various middle eastern tribal dialects/languages and the philosophy of those people they lived with and visited!Bell and Lawrence due diligence was FAR beyond the norm of the typical Victorian era leader/politician/historian and most of all...military commanders!The middle east today is merely a glimpse from the past, a place that has more or less ""remained the same"" for the last 1000 years, because ""western/European"" interest never got past their ""white mans burden"" mentality! Bell and Lawrence ""knew"" how the ""locals:"" felt about their countries..Well done Herzog, another classic, well directed, well acted, well written. A woman can do anything she decides to learn how to do!!!"

" Most underrated movie in a long time
",2018-04-20 00:00:00,9,"The critics who fall all over each other for crap like Marvel comic book movies, Transformers and the like, panned this movie. Well, they blew it. This movie has the typical Herzog exceptional cinematography set to absolutely beautiful music. Very few directors in the history of cinema have Herzog's ear for just the right music. We're not talking about putting the records you collected as a teenager in your movies like so many other directors do who cater to imbeciles. This story is intelligent, feels like a documentary. It's beautiful. Of course, Herzog also touches on his man vs nature favorite theme. If you're a fan of Herzog, ignore the critics (they've become useless) and see this film. Trust Herzog, don't trust the critics ever again. It's like listening to a poem."
" Revisionist History
",2018-04-18 00:00:00,1,"I hate movies that go to the earth and the moon to look historical, but are not. This is JFK goes to the Middle East. The opening scene, (1914), has a group of Senior British Officers ,and Winston Churchill,(First Lord of the Admiralty in 1914), discussing the Sykes-Picot agreement. Just a few small problems, in 1914 TE Lawrence was a Lieutenant assigned cartography duties in the basement of British Headquarters, Winston Churchill never visited the Middle East during WWI, he fought in trenches in France. The Sykes=Picot Agreement was leaked in the May-June of 1916, two years after this meeting is suppose to have taken place. At that point I went numb, and just finish watching the movie. I'm sure Gertrude Bell had some role in advising the British, but this movie makes a mockery of whatever she did do. The fact that this movie was made in 2015, and not released on Showtime til 2018, speaks volumes."
" Beautifl showcase of a fascinating, talented, and independent woman.
",2018-04-15 00:00:00,10,"Movies are a great way to reach a wider audience and spark interest in further reading, but this one has an inaccuracy in it with Henry Cadogan. Other than that, it is excellent. It ought to have made more money, but ""most"" people don't care enough about learning new things. That is the reason why it didn't make a profit.The movie beautifully brings Gertrude Bell to life, and succeeds in showcasing her brilliance and her fascination with learning about the world, plus her talent for diplomacy. Male jealousy of her achievements is shown from the outset. She just doesn't care, and that is one of the things that made her great.Ms. Bell expected and required men to accept her on her own terms."
" A beautiful film
",2018-04-15 00:00:00,10,I've watched this film several times the music is haunting and Nickole Kidman is excilent in her portraile of Gertrude Bell plus it's a historical piece the way she understood the people their way of life and how Politics can muddy up life
" An Entertaining Movie based in History.
",2018-04-14 00:00:00,8,"It is ridiculous that this movie has a 5.7 rating. It is a very interesting and entertaining work based on the life of an incredible woman. I really can't get people who don't understand the difference between a MOVIE, that's main objective is to entertain and a DOCUMENTARY that is meant to inform. I enjoyed this movie and thought Werner Herzog's respect for the truth of Gertrude Bell and the region came across on screen. Nicole Kidman gives a fine performance as Bell. She comes across as an earnest, seeker of the truth of the region and it's people, much like a latter day, more civilized, female version of Sir Richard Burton. I liked Robert Pattinson as T.E. Lawrence. It was a subtle performance and a scary one to take on, because Peter O' Toole, ya know? The rest of the cast is solid.Any movie set in the Middle East, done by a westerner, will suffer in comparison to 'Lawrence of Arabia' and Herzog does a good job of not trying to compete with spectacle, though the movie is beautifully shot. He focuses on the interaction between the people and Gertrude's attempts at romance. I didn't know anything about Bell before watching this movie. She was really a remarkable woman and I thank this film for bringing her story to life for a modern audience. If you're not the type to nitpick over whether or not the term 'a lot' was used at the turn of the 19th century and you like historic movies that prompt you to learn more about it's subject matter, you will enjoy 'Queen of the Desert'."
" brought back memories
",2018-01-26 00:00:00,10,"I was in the Peace Corps in Turkey in the early '60s. 
This film brought back memories in so many ways.
My roommate and I, traveled extensively also when we 
were not involved in TEFL in a town in SW Turkey. 
I still remember details about our time and cherish it all.
So much of what we saw is gone now due to deliberate
destruction, e.g. Palmyra, or due to war in the region.
I loved the film and realize movie license when I see it.
Apparently others do not.
(Also have studied Bell and she was amazing given the time
frame when she lived. It was still like that in some ways for
my roommate and I living and traveling even then in the ME)"
" Historical Renactment of Importance
",2018-01-07 00:00:00,10,"As the Ottoman Empire was collapsing Gertrude came in with knowledge of the tribal systems of the people and was able to help the authorities set up kingdoms with appointed Kings from the appropriate lineage to assauge the people. Thereby making the transition to life after the Ottoman Empire peaceful and firmly undergirded. The acting, settings and captioning made it an easy and enjoyable film to watch. A useful tool in the study of Gertrude who was the ""Uncrowned Queen of the Desert who was divinely assigned to appoint Kings""."
" Bewitchingly insufficient
",2017-12-17 00:00:00,9,"While modern events conspire to ensure that we understand at least a little of the Arab world, it needs to be recalled that - for centuries confined within the Ottoman Empire - that world was very much a closed book to Westerners, and all the more tantalising for that. In the Late Victorian and Edwardian eras, that was all beginning to change, as the Ottoman Empire began to collapse and British and other Empires were muscling in. British aristocrat Gertrude Bell (1868-1926) fell into that period and was - by some near-miracle - at the heart of the process referred to. And no matter how hard it tries, this film cannot really inform us how Bell came to be regarded by Churchill as the most influential woman in the British Empire. And, since documentaries and biographies can do that, the film must be seen as something of a failure in its own terms.However, (and this is a big however), where Herzog wins us over is with the amazing way in which Nicole Kidman's Bell (admittedly better looking than the original) carries all before her, clearly proving so stunning, awe-inspiring and irresistible to most of the influential men she meeets (be they British or Arab) that they a) mostly cannot help but take her seriously, b) end up respecting her and c) fall for her romantically in a big way! Pictures of the real Bell suggest she was not lacking in magnetism in her looks. but she clearly must also have had something far more imbued by her personailty, and this movie goes at least some way to showing us that, if not enlightening us properly as to what it entailed.And, stunningly, we are shown how the regal nature of Bell develops in line with her growing joy and delight in everything the East has to offer. This is interesting, given that her desire to be there, to have that adventure, came before her expertise. Hence in her first scenes in Persia, Bell is wide-eyed and still rather ignorant, but also entirely open and willing to any influences that come her way, absorbing all of that and growing in stature as she does so. Since this first part of her education in things eastern comes in a package with head-over-heals romantic love and intellectual oneness with James Franco's (admittedly cumbersomely-accented) British diplomat Henry Cadogan, the first half of the film works extremely powerfully as a romance.At this stage of the film, we in the audience empathise powerfully, as we also gasp at the sheer wonder of Persia - its birdsong in scented gardens, languid pools of water, its poetry, art, architecture and ancient civilisation. We are also drawn strongly into the developing attraction between soulmates that is portrayed, and are thus hit severely when Bell learns that she will never see Cadogan again, much as she still adores him. I nearly lost control of my emotions at this point, I'll admit, so potent was the empathy inspired with the character's emptiness and misery. Fortunately, this was not to be the last love Bell experienced, though tragedy again struck; but by this part of the film - Kidman's Bell is astounding us with her utter lack of fear as she goes on exploring deeper and deeper into unknown Arab lands. Again it is entrancing scenically, though here we fuly encounter the film's failure to make us understand how Bell achieved what she did. This is then a much less successful second half, despite it's unquestionable beauty of production, and the amazing separate situations it depicts. What is lacking is the flow of narrative that enlightens us more fully. The dots are just not connected here.Robert Pattinson's take on TE Lawrence is more down-to-earth than Peter O'Toole's all those years ago, but the portrayal is satisfying enough, though the film scarcely touches on how it must really have been to have two such powerful personalities working together. Given that both came together with Churchill and others, as the film hints, we need far more than Herzog is able to offer us in this respect. Hence, for neither the first nor the last time a biopic leaves us longing to learn more about its hero. Clearly, that is as much a failure of a film as it is a success; but in the end I've opted to give ""Queen of the Desert"" a 9 for what it hints at, if failing to fully present."
" Not bad
",2017-12-10 00:00:00,6,"This film was on TV last night, so I decided to watch it as the theme is set in the desert, which I like. Plus James and Nicole as leading roles promised a good film + that Twilight guy. But... it turned out that the film was not really that great as the names in it.My main problem with the film is that it is set in the middle east - Syria, Iraq and other countries around, but as someone who has been to Morocco 4 times, I could tell that all the places are in Morocco: Marrakesh, Ait Benhaddoun, Ouarzazate, Merzouga and so on... So that definitely killed any authenticity to the film.I have no idea about that lady. Her life seems interesting, so will read more about her.Not a bad film, but nothing extraordinary either. If you like the Orient, North Africa and the desert, you will enjoy the scenery6 from me."
" The desert knows no minutes
",2017-11-27 00:00:00,8,"This is a biography of Gertrude Bell (Nicole Kidman) who was an intellectual woman who lived in the disintegrating Ottoman empire. She was beloved by the locals as a westerner who understood their heart and soul. She knew T.E. Lawrence (Robert Patterson) who was technically beneath her and aided Churchill (Christopher Fulford). She was an author, poet, archaeologist, diplomat, traveler and spy.While I liked the film, I didn't love it as much as I wanted to. Please forgive my misogyny, but her biography has a very female point of view, not that it was a bad thing, it just seemed to dummy down her life. The first 40 minutes of the film concerns her early life and suitors as well as her lover Henry (James Franco in a clean cut role). Her life in the desert shows her meeting T.E. Lawrence and love for Charles Doughty-Wylie (Damian Lewis). The film seemed very poetic in nature as we are read portions of their love letters. The nuts and bolts work of Gertrude Bell took a back seat to art and style as Kidman played Bell with class and distinction.It seemed more of an art film, then a biopic.Guide: No swearing. Brief implied sex. Kidman in a wet transparent undergarment...because sometimes love letters and poetry are not enough."
" BEST MOVIE Awesome
",2017-11-05 00:00:00,10,"I don't know why a lot of people didn't like this movie , i thought this was an amazing movie , i would totally recommend this movie to everyone , everyone must watch this movie. Nicole Kidman did an awesome job in this movie, i thought that the beginning of the movie was very beautiful i like how they started with the dessert and the Persian farsi vocalist amazing i loved the vocals i thought that klaus badelt was awesome and the crew, everyone did an awesome job for this movie i think. I dunno why there are many bad reviews about this movie is not worse than other bad movies out there really."
" Don't bury Herzog yet... this may be his best!
",2017-10-14 00:00:00,10,"Phooey with all the comments that this is not ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" or that it doesn't have the passion of other Herzog movies like Fitzcarraldo. I loved it. And, I say nay to the reviewers who praise the cinematographer, but say Herzog, the director has lost it. As I see it, Herzog is the guy telling the cameraman what to do, and Herzog has the last say in film editing. And, visually, this movie is stunning. AND, the musical soundtrack is awesome, even better than Lawrence of Arabia (except for that unforgettable theme.) Then there's Nicole Kidman. She certainly does it for me. I was with her all the way. Never did I think, ""oh, she wasn't right in that scene."" It all felt right all the way to the final shot of the ""back side"" of the camel with Nicole riding into the sunset. A couple of things, I haven't seen anybody mention: First is another dimension to this movie and a possible reason Herzog did it. It provides a dramatic perspective on what the Middle East was then, and what it is now. It's an antidote to the Western ""crusader"" perception of Middle Easterners. The second comment I haven't heard is that this movie at times comes across as a documentary, which is why I think some label it as ""dull."" But, the line between documentary and ""movie"" movie is getting blurred these days. I'd rather see a ""movie"" that comes across as a documentary (which this one does) than a ""documentary"" that appears to try to be a movie. ""Queen of the Desert"" is very ""educational."" I learned a lot, as if that's the kiss of death for a real movie. No problem for me. I was highly informed (I had never heard of Gertrude Bell) and highly entertained."
" A Cup of Tea with Your Desert
",2017-10-09 00:00:00,2,"Poor choice of actors as portrayals were not convincing (mostly just eye candy appeal), and acting seemed to be mostly rote memorization and regurgitate. Writers tried to rescue with emphasis on romantic scenes which were also not convincing. Adding a Lawrence character was almost a charade. No sense of the hard work that Kidman's character, Bell, must have put in/endured. Lots of desert scenes which seemed more Hollywood cute than a sweaty gritty actual depiction"
" Mr Herzogs first feature film
",2017-08-26 00:00:00,4,"Frankly disappointing. I had expected more of Werner Hertzog but perhaps it was not so surprising for his first feature film - unfamiliar territory ? For years I have studied the exploits of Gertrude Bell in the Middle East. She had a profound political influence in Mesopotamia. In effect she drew the boundaries of present day Iraq. Included within these boundaries were the Kurds , the Sunni and the Shia. We are felling the effects to this day. However Mr Hertzog seemed more interested in her love life - such as it was. I watched with my brother - he is even more interested in Gertrude Bell than me. He has visited the various sites associated with the Bell family - Red Barn in Redcar,N Yorks , East Rounton and Mount Grace Priory. Definite thumbs down from him. I suppose a ""romantic"" element was inevitable to attract an audience."
" Boring grandiosity
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,1,"I stared in disbelief as Nicole Kidman entered and I was expected to believe she was a young maybe early 20's woman. I love her don't get me wrong, but that was beyond any sense of reality. Her simpering sugary overly acted ""love"" affair with Franco made me gag on it's sugary soft spoken sweetness and Franco always looked like he was about to turn to the camera and say, just joking wah wah wah. I don't even know what this movie was supposed to be about as my mind kept straying to other things. Should I go to the grocery store or just order a pizza. Should I do laundry now or wear an outfit I don't really like but is clean for work tomorrow. What is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow. At about the halfway mark I threw in the towel and just looked up the actual woman. Her biography was far more interesting than this tripe that the director wanted to go who knows where."
" ""To wake in that desert dawn was like waking in the heart of an opal...""
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,8,"Indeed, one of the first feminists to make a major mark on the world was Gertrude Bell and this cinematic dramatized biography, while magnificent to view and sumptuous in visual details, is not what we have grown to expect from writer/director Werner Herzog who has studied history, literature and theatre and founded his own production company in 1963. Has staged several operas, besides others in Bayreuth, Germany, and at the Milan La Scala in Italy. Herzog has won numerous national and international awards for his films. We have come to depend on his illumination of great people of history: in QUEEN OF THE DESERT he seems anchored in created a vastly impressive period piece rather than focus on the extraordinary accomplishments of Gertrude Bell.As the description states the film is a chronicle of British socialite Gertrude Bell's life, a traveler, writer, archaeologist, explorer, cartographer, and political attaché for the British Empire at the dawn of the twentieth century whose impact on the decisions made about the lands of Arabia and the Middle East were of major importance. She was a woman who left the comforts of life to become and intrinsic part of the great desert she loved so passionately. Gertrude is played with grace by Nicole Kidman, her love interests are Henry Cadogan played by James Franco (impressive in a romance drama for a change), and Charles Doughty-Wylie (Damian Lewis). The supporting cast includes Jay Abdo as Gertrude's guide Fattuh, Christopher Fulford as Winston Churchill, ad Robert Pattison as Col. T.E. Lawrence (aka Lawrence of Arabia).The photography is splendid (Peter Zeitlinger) as is the musical score by Klaus Badelt. QUEEN OF THE DESERT is a fine evening's entertainment – if only the film had focused more on the incredible life and achievements of Gertrude Bell"
" A lot better than I thought it was going to be.
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,8,"Truth be told, I haven't seen many Herzog films (although I wish I had now) which is probably why I enjoyed this more than that person who said ""a typical Herzog."" I thought the cinematography was really good and accurately displayed how Gertrude Bell viewed the countries in her perspective. Nicole Kidman was good in her role and so was the rest of the cast, who all gave good, realistic, stable performances. The editing to join the scenes together was very good, and because of the really good editing the film had a nice flow to it that can let you be carried by the film's wind. The true story that this film was based on is also very interesting, and was a good choice for a movie.Overall, I think you'll like it if you're like me and haven't seen many Herzog movies. Sorry about the bad review, but don't worry, I'm working on it. Right now, I'm just stating what I liked about the film, and if you'd like it or not. My personal opinion is 8.0/10, mostly because of the adventurous, exotic and foreign tone and the beautiful cinematography, and I think you'll enjoy it if you don't have too critical a mind."
" Beautifully filmed and interesting - not an adventure story
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,7,I can see why this movie wasn't a box office smash - it's not an adventure tale with battles and lots of excitement. This is a biopic of a brave British woman who explored the desert areas of what is now Syria Iraq Jordan etc in the early 1900s and got to know the tribes and later help draw up boundaries of the newly formed countries after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Her ill fated romances punctuate the story.Nicole Kidman convincingly plays a range of ages from 20s to I guess 40s. Robert Pattinson looks a bit goofy and out of place as TE Lawrence. But even more strangely cast is James Franco as an English civil servant. He whispers his dialog so his accent isn't terribly disastrous.The photography in the desert is quite stunning.Interesting.
" Quite enjoyable if you don't know your history and have not read the book 'Desert Queen'.
",2017-06-06 00:00:00,6,"This film was an attractive costume drama which would not have been out of place on Masterpiece Theater, but anyone familiar with Gertrude Bell's achievements and who has read the book 'Desert Queen', will be disappointed at how much was left out. Yes, she was born to a wealthy family, had a brilliant mind, earned a first class degree at Oxford - even attending Oxford was a rarity for a woman at that time. She mixed in the best society being very well connected socially, and also enjoyed the company of many intellectuals of the day. Yes, she fell in love with Henry Cadogan and mourned his death for seven years. She had been prevented from marrying him by her overly possessive parents on some very flimsy grounds - he was a gambler and had no fortune, when they could have easily set up a trust fund for her which he could not touch. Her parents apparently even opened her mail to ensure that she was not being led astray. Her dutiful devotion and love for her parents may have caused her later infatuations and unrequited love for the wrong men. Her friendship with the married Doughty Wiley was shown, as was her iffy working relationship with T. E. Lawrence who supported her while being quite catty behind her back, but her later unrequited love for Henry Fitzsimmons, who used her but refused flat out to marry her, was not. Nor was her long and very close friendship with King Faisal of Iraq, which began when he was Prince and whom she had been instrumental in supporting on the throne. As Faisal's wife and family remained in Mecca and Gertrude became his close adviser, many suspected that they were lovers.Her years of round the world tours to get over Henry's death were left out. Eventually she began her journeys through the middle east and gained the knowledge which put her in the center of things in WWI as a source of information about the Arab tribes, and supporter and close adviser to King Faisal. She was present at the Paris Peace Conference when the winners, desperate to get their hands on the oil, divided up the middle east between them, largely reneging on the promises to allow the Arabs their own kingdom and instead installing puppet kingdoms under British and French mandates.The film ended with a very brief meeting with Faisal and his brother Abdullah, and an epilogue about the creation of Syria, Iraq and Saudi Arabia where Gertrude Bell had helped define the borders and choose the rulers. But there was much more to the story. After the heady success of helping to create the modern middle eastern kingdoms, being appointed Oriental Secretary awarded the CBE, and being Faisal's right hand woman, called upon every day not only for advice, but companionship, games, tennis, Gertrude found herself becoming less and less important as her task had ended. It probably did not help that she was a woman and had trodden on quite a few toes on the way up. Men would have felt threatened by her and wives would have been jealous. She concentrated her efforts on her writing and establishing the Baghdad Museum, but her life had become empty and no doubt she felt unwanted and useless. Faisal saw less of her and spent more time in Europe 'taking the cures'. Her family fortune disappeared in the post war changing times and she was reduced to living alone if not in poverty, but 'straightened circumstances'. In 1926 she died of an overdose of sleeping pills, which was ruled an accident.Other than leaving half the story out, the other serious flaw was the miscasting of Faisal and Abdullah and their very brief appearance at the close of the film. The two actors should have switched parts. Abdullah, the great grandson of today's King of Jordan, was short and round faced, Faisal was tall, thin, charismatic and extremely handsome. His leadership of the Arab revolt was the reason for the allied win over the Turks. From the film one would think she had only met with Faisal for one minute. Showing more of her relationship with Faisal would have perked up the film enormously. Overall, this topic should have been a Masterpiece Theater miniseries running for at least six hours."

I lived through one: 1958-1968, when being a kid in America was marvelous. Sorry you guys missed it. Werner Herzog's movie, Queen of the Desert, is set in another one of those golden periods, from the end of Victoria's reign to the First World War, when the Brits ruled practically everything, the sun never set on the Empire, pip pip cheerio stiff upper lip wot wot, and fin de siècle English upper crust lower middle aristocrats could traverse the tottering Ottoman Empire with quite a degree of impunityuntil it all changed, as golden decades are wont to do.The movie depicts Gertrude Bell, a real life lower middle aristocrat who gets it into her head between cotillions to go do something adventurous. Given the bunch of lower middle aristocrat idiot suitors her Mum keeps throwing at her, I am sympathetic. (By the way, Mum is played by Jenny Agutter. Jenny Agutter! Remember her from Logan's Run, An American Werewolf in London? Oh yeah, you remember. Seen her popping up quite a bit lately, including Captain America: Winter Soldier. Nice). Gertrude's Dad suggests a trip to Tehran, which isn't the crazy idea it would be today; back then it would be like a trip to Rio: exotic, interesting, an incomprehensible language, somewhat dangerous, but civilized.So, she goes, sponsored by her quite delightful British Consul uncle, portrayed by Mark Lewis Jones, who has the best lines in the movie (except for one short stint at the beginning when Nick Waring as Sir Mark Sykes delivers a series of insults worthy of Peter Capaldi in In the Loop). There, she falls in love with Henry Cadogan (portrayed by James Franco in the wooden, non-expressive acting style he perfected as Green Goblin), who ends up killing himself, and then Gertrude falls in love with Major Charles Doughty-Wylie (played by Damien Lewisyou know, Captain Winters in Band of Brothers) who volunteers for Gallipoli, which is pretty much suicidehmm. Mayhaps those idiot suitors back in merry ole dodged a bullet?Anyways, grief-stricken because of driving men to suicide, she takes off for the deserts of the Middle East, meeting Druze and Bedouins and Lawrence of Arabia and Ottoman Lieutenants and single-handedly changing the course of Arab historywell, no. As much as Herzog wants you to believe that, just ain't true. Bell was one of many persons involved in the modern shaping of the Arab peninsula, including at least one other woman, Lady Anne Blunt, who reached the city of Ha'il before her.Nicole Kidman portrays Gertrude from about age 17 to well into her forties with nary a whiff of extra makeup or softened lens, at least that I could detect, and that's nice. She's a queen in her own right and does a rather excellent job of idealizing and overblowing the heroic woman-hear-me-roar aspect of Bell that director Werner Herzog is obviously intending. Which is a lovely 21st Century notion, but Pax Britannica was more responsible for Bell's safe travels than anything. That, and the tolerance–and amusement–of the Druze and Bedouins."
" Way different than the screening that I saw
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,8,"Last spring I was invited to see a screening of Queen of the Desert. I was so honored. I of course signed the usual documentation stated I wouldn't state anything until the film was released, which was so hard because I felt that the screening was so good.I studied this part of history as part of my bachelors degree in history. I even went to Oxford University and took a class on the British perspective. So I felt I had a great understanding about this subject. I am a fan of the actor's in the film, especially Robert Pattinson and said so after the screening.So after the screening, which I did mention that I would go see it when it was released. I waited patiently for it to be released her in the U.S. Which at times it looked like it would never be released.When I finally saw it was going to be released On Demand I was ready. So what a surprise when I sat down to watch it and it was a complete different film than what I originally saw.Now, first it was still a great film, but just not the one I saw. I did enjoy the new cut, it had more of a historic aspect to it than the one I saw originally. To me, that may not reach a wide audience. I believe all the actor's did a great job. I also liked this version more than the screening because there were more scenes with Robert Pattinson. (I did mention I am a fan).The film itself is beautifully made (now its not Lawrence of Arabia and anyone comparing it to it shouldn't)* and the music is also just so fitting.I would recommend this film if you have an interest in how the middle east was before it was the middle east, a fan of any of the actor's involved, or of just some great photographer in a film.*this is my opinion."
" A Much Better Film Than Currently Rated
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,8,"I do not understand how such a remarkable and beautiful movie is rated as low as this (5.6 now). I do agree that James Franco is not right for the his role as Henry Cadogan. He is a fine actor, but this role doesn't suit him. Other performances Nicole Kidman, Damian Lewis, Robert Pattinson and Jay Abdo are either good or impressive. I think this is one of Nicole Kidman's finest performances. The story line is god and needed to be told. The photography is terrific. This is a memorable film. Dr. Dan Finley, Panama City, Florida"
" middle east adventure
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,8,"movies affect people differently. I enjoyed this movie very much. most don't, apparently. (it sat on the shelf for quite a while). Nicole, gertrude bell, is a bored English woman in the early 1900's. looking for excitement, her father sends her to Tehran to live with relatives. once there, she falls in love with james franco, looking very handsome. eventually she roams the middle east dessert absorbing the beauty and mystery it provides. this is all before there are defined countries, like Syria, Saudi arabia, etc. and everything is controlled by tribes led by sheiks. oil hasn't been discovered, yet. it's not a sweeping epic, but there are shades of Lawrence of arabia. Nicole looks beautiful, as does the film. although it is based on a true story, it's hard to believe. just sort of take it all in and enjoy on the big screen. it would all be lost on TV."
" Not nearly as bad as its reputation suggests
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,6,"""Queen of the desert"" (2015 release; 125 min.) is a bio-pic of Gertrude Bell, a/k/a ""the female Lawrence of Arabia"". As the movie opens, we are told it is ""Cairo, 1914, British Arab Bureau"", where a group of men (including Winston Churchill) is debating how to reshape the faltering Ottoman Empire. Someone mentions they should maybe consult Gertrude Bell. The movie then goes to ""Twelve Years Earlier"", where we see Gertrude restless in her parents' strict British upbringing. She begs her father to let her get away from it all, and he finally gives in, sending her to to British Embassy in Tehran. At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is the latest from writer-director Werner Herzog, equally known for both feature films and documentaries. Here he brings to the big screen a 15 year period in Gertrude Bell's life, during which she traveled the Arabian peninsula and deserts relentlessly, earning her the nickname ""the female Lawrence of Arabia"" (T.E. Lawrence in fact appears in the film as well). Herzog is known as a very solid storyteller, so it comes as a surprise that the storytelling isn't stronger, in particular the first half of the movie drags far too long for its own good. As we are watching the movie unfold, it is clear that this is a big budget movie, and in the end the movie functions as much as a travelogue than anything else. There are some notable acting performances, none more so than Nicole Kidman, in what I consider her best role in YEARS. James Franco is in the movie for a good half hour (as the Secretary of the Tehran Embassy and Gertrude's early love interest), and an unrecognizable Robert Pattinson as T.E. Lawrence.This movie premiered over 2 years ago at the Berlin Film Festival to less than stellar reviews, and pretty much sank like a stone upon a wider European release. Imagine my surprise when the movie opened this weekend out of the blue and without any pre-release hype or advertising on a single screen for all of Greater Cincinnati. The Saturday matinée screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great, and even though the movie gets only 2 screenings a day, I would be surprised it if lasted more than a single week on the big screen. That said, given its reputation, I had zero expectations going into this, and much to my surprise the movie isn't nearly as bad as I had expected it. The lovely photography and scenery, and a very likable performance from Nicole Kidman, did the trick for me. If you liked ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (and who doesn't?), you should definitely give this a try as well. Keep your expectations low, and chances are you'll find this fairly enjoyable."
" not bad , not bad at all
",2017-03-31 00:00:00,5,"first of all i am one of those who gets bored very easily and don't too much generous when rating , i see honestly that movie is one of those who slaughtered and the people , critics be offbeat with it yes it is not perfect bit it is waaayyyy better than others , it has a very nice moments and good cinematography , it had a good acting , strange scenes , yes historically i am sure it is inaccurate but you can watch it as a documentary of the desert and yet it is one of rare films who didn't attack the arabs , t6hey got another point of view and this is new"
" Stick with Priscilla!
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,4,"The life of the adventuress and explorer Gertrude Bell might just seem like the kind of subject that the director Werner Herzog might embrace but this stately, grandiose epic is more like something James Ivory or even David Lean might have tossed off and which, for over two hours, moves at a snail's pace. Nicole Kidman does what she can with the part of Bell but is defeated by Herzog's own ponderous script and she is surrounded by some very dull men, (Damian Lewis, James Franco and Robert Pattinson as a slightly camp Lawrence of Arabia), and despite the locations it's not even a particularly attractive looking film. If you must spend time with a queen of the desert stick with Priscilla whose adventures were a lot more fun than Gertrude's."
" A Tragic Anachronism of Female Objectification
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,2,"How is it possible, in 2015, for a respected filmmaker to produce such a sadly anachronistic view of this intelligent woman, who defied the extreme limitations of her age and led a truly remarkable life? I am astounded by the profound denial of factual content in this cinematic version of Gertrude Bell, by no means mundane in reality – and the reduction of this multi-dimensional human being to a mere object of surface ornament. Is this Herzog's idea of a joke? Or is it symbolic of the state of his imagination – a vast desert? Even Kidman's Oscar-winning acting prowess cannot save this from being a pale and shallow impression of a person deserving of a far greater – and deeper - vision. For those who are really interested in learning more about Gertrude Bell, steer well clear - I am still desperately trying to find anything that bears a faint resemblance to her life in this 122-minute- long 'pop video'."
