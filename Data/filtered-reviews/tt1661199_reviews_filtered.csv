" Okay remake, but it's a bit boring and overrated remake overall
",2021-04-09 00:00:00,6,"While it may have some boring changes, it does have some right things. The story is almost like the original animated film of 1950, but with some boring changesPros
1. Lily James did a wonderful job portraying the female protagonist and is quite charming. The blue dress on her looks gorgeous
2. I'm proud that the prince has more development and more lines
3. Backstory of Cinderella and her parents
4. The goose coachman is fine, as with lizard footmen, but Bruno and the old horse will always be better.5. I love the 18th century costumes and powdered wigs on the servantsCons
1. Lady Tremaine was too ugly to be young! Her red hair is just a stupid idea and Cate Blenchett is an inferior to Eleanor Audley and she did awful!2. The Grand Duke's character is ruined by becoming a bad guy
3. No mice having roles
4. Not a musical as it took away some memorable songs such as A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes
5. No Bruno the Dog
6. The lizards were a bit unnecessary but their human forms look nice."
" The Best Cinderella Movie
",2021-04-07 00:00:00,10,"I have loved Cinderella since I was a small child. I have seen every Cinderella movie ever. This is my all time favorite movie. I love the theme. I love the way the Peince looks and her. I love that Cinderella is such a beautiful person both inside and out.This is a beautiful movie of loss and love. Of struggles and life. Courage and Kindness. Beautifully written and performed.Great amazing movie. Thank you all

" Stunning version of the Cinderella/Tuhkatriinu
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,10,"9th point goes to Sandy Powell - her blue dress is most beautiful dress in the world!
And the 10th point - for Sir Branagh! Hea put all the possible warmth and shine in this movie! (Only now I understand, why I wanted to see in Tenet someone more bad - he's real life person did not disappeared even in most bad scenes.)"
" Utterly charming and magical.
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,9,"Well, what a surprise this was. I found it to be wonderful, heartwarming viewing, I know that won't appeal to all these days , but it's my kind of thing, and it made me feel warm and fuzzy.
The CGI was used well and didn't overpower the film, and hats off to the cast.One I'll now buy on 4k disc, as I'll happily revisit this every so often ."
" Jesous! Was really damn good!
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,8,"I watched it with my kid-daughter...and I loved it more than she did!
Was trully great movie. And very emotional too. I didn't expect to be that good!"
" MD is amazing
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,10,For me the star of the movie is Mark D (who plays Cinderella) such beauty and grace what an absolute delight to watch. Saw MD in other films but really here such a shining star
" Fun Disney remake
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,7,"Fans of Cousin Rose from Downton Abbey will want to rent two movies to see her adorable energy and dazzling smile: Cinderella and Mama Mia 2: Here We Go Again. She's just delightful, and she puts you in a good mood when you see her twirling around at a party. What better choice to play Cinderella?
In this lavish Kenneth Branagh remake, there's a twist to the story that many versions don't include. If anyone felt Cinderella and Prince Charming (played in this movie by Richard Madden) didn't have enough interaction to fall in love, they'll be happy this time around. They meet in the forest at the beginning of the movie, with each identity a secret from the other. A bit of banter, a few smiles, and they're drawn to each other before the ball. I always liked that part of Sleeping Beauty, so I was glad to see it in another fairy tale.Cate Blanchett plays the wicked stepmother and Helena Bonham Carter plays the fairy godmother - but wouldn't it have been even more entertaining to see the roles reversed? Blanchett seems far more ethereal, and Carter has typecast herself with modern audiences with a wicked tinge. You'll also see Sophia McShera and Holliday Grainger as Anastasia and Drusilla (since this is Disney, the names could be kept!), and Stellan Skarsgard as the king. And, a bonus to these real-people Disney remakes is the repetition of the original music! Hum along as Lily James gets bedecked in her beautiful butterfly gown and glass slippers to go to her ball, and enjoy this family-friendly flick."
" Soooooo MAGICAL!!!!
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,10,"Beautiful cast, everyone in this film acted so naturally. Just like the classic, this is breathtaking."
" Cinderella
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,10,Cinderella is my favorite movie and Lily James is my favorite actress.
" Another life action that falls short
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,4,The story of Cinderella is prety straight forward and we all know it. The actors themseles are for the most part competent but the script falls short in every way. cinderella is portaid as someone who literaly doesn't have the ability to stand up for herself in any shape or form. Even if she's given the change at the end of the movie. Wich I realy just can't relate to so I also had a hard time feeling sorry for the character. The final confrentation with her step-mom could have been so much more but it realy fell short. I also don't feel much for the CGI animals but that didn't realy bother me. This movie tries to be a movie for a young and older audiance at the same time. But it ends up hurting itself a lot in the proces while sending some mixed mesages and creating quite a few plotholes.
" Magical and dreamy
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,10,"This film doesn't disappoint. It's a feast for the eyes, the sets and costumes are truly magical and just what you want from a fairytale. I think Lily James was perfectly cast and has a natural innocent beauty about her. King of the north Prince Charming is lovely. I really enjoyed this version."
" Cinderella and drisella
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,8,Sophie mc shera plays in downton abbey together with lily james.
" Stop remaking classic films!
",2020-11-25 00:00:00,1,Rhetorical question: Is Hollywood so creatively bankrupt that they cannot come up with any original ideas for films anymore?
" Plays out slightly differently compared to the '50 production - to positive effect
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,7,"An improvement on Disney's past attempt from 1950.I do like the animated version from the studio, but this 2015 release of 'Cinderella' makes for a more enjoyable experience in my eyes. Lily James and Richard Madden are smart choices to play Cinderella and Prince, while Cate Blanchett is impressive as the Stepmother. Helena Bonham Carter (Fairy Godmother), Stellan Skarsg√•rd (Grand Duke) and Nonso Anozie (Captain) are also noteworthy.The premise has a few changes, the ending plays out slightly differently compared to the '50 production - to positive effect. It also makes the nastiness of Blanchett's character unmistakably clear, I actually felt hatred for her - which wasn't the case, at least to the same extent, with the original.Good viewing."
" love love lov love lov it
",2020-10-27 00:00:00,10,"Didn't this film have a 7.4 recently or is it just me anyway I love this movie it is heart warming pretty great acting and makes you smile cry and feel her pain
Cate Blanchett plays the evil stepmother so well it amazes me and I love the little cgi mice they are so adorable
oh and the blue dress was the main highlight of the film I mean I'm so used to ever after from the 90's but now this has branded me in the heart and became my favorite
it also has great character development to a story we know so well just love it and will buy it next time I get paid"
" A few too many pumpkins...
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,6,"This is a film with two aspects. The better is the beautifully created fairy tale/love story that uses animation and visual effects sparingly and carefully to help recreate some of the magic of the story. The other part, however, is the writing and the casting - and those, sadly, aren't too much to write home about. Lily James and Richard Madden aren't quite as sickly as Gemma Craven and Richard Chamberlain (""Slipper and the Rose"" (1976)) but then neither do they have their chemistry nor charm. A fairly glittering supporting cast that includes Sir Derek Jacobi, Helena Bonham-Carter and an oddly off-form Cate Blanchett range from indifferent to downright hammy and some of the dialogue really does make you cringe! It's a watchable effort from Sir Kenneth Branagh, but the whole is nowhere near the sum of the parts."
" Best remakes
",2020-10-18 00:00:00,10,"A quite beautiful adaptation of a Disney classic
Right now Disney's current trend with their live-action films has been a series of live-action re-imaginings of their animated classics. Obviously this has proved to be a rather polarizing tactic amongst certain fans, namely because they believe that these are intended to replace the original films. Well I can assure you that this ain't the intention. You see the internet has this mentality about remakes that they're supposed to replace the original when that's not the case. Hell, even if they don't end up being very good, the original is not tainted in any way. And that's been the case with Disney's live- action remakes, even the ones that haven't been well-received like the 'Alice' films and 'Maleficent'.'Cinderella', however, was the first of these remakes to actually be well-received by critics and rightfully so as it truly is a beautiful new adaptation of the story that Disney first told in their 1950 animated classic. The original 'Cinderella' is easily one of my all-time favorites when it comes to Disney's animated films so I was really excited to see this new version and I absolutely loved it. Sure it's basically just the same story as the original but it manages to update it by doing some things better than the original. Namely, the relationship between Ella and the Prince in this version is much more developed compared to the original where they immediately fall in love and only share a few scenes together. Lily James is absolutely fantastic in the role of Ella while Richard Madden proves to be, for lack of a better term, a very charming Prince Charming. Of course the rest of the cast is fantastic as well, from Cate Blanchett's excellent take on Lady Tremaine to Helena Bonham Carter's scene-stealing turn as the Fairy Godmother.But like the original, the film has gotten some flak from feminists over its title character, Cinderella. The argument is that the character is too passive of a protagonist who only sits around waiting to be rescued. Now this is an argument I've never really agreed with. Sure Cinderella doesn't really do as much compared to some future Disney princesses but there's more to her than that. She really deserves the credit. She gets thrown her way by her evil stepmother and stepsisters. The film very much maintains the theme of encouraging people to 'have courage and be kind'. And let's face it folks... those are good words to live by in today's age.Like I said before, these Disney remakes aren't replacing the originals. They're just here to serve as interesting new takes on their original source material. And as much I know I'm going to get a lot of flak for this by those who are opposed to the remakes... I think this new Cinderella is better than the original. Don't get me wrong the original is still an animated masterpiece but as a whole I feel that Kenneth Branagh delivered a fantastic adaptation that both reflects the original while also being its own thing."
" Nice graphic
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,10,"Beautiful movie to watch, it's so friendly to watch it with your family. Thanks for producer."
" Not ""wowed"" entirely...
",2020-09-11 00:00:00,5,"This movie...is so far from the original story. Growing up in the 90's, Cinderella has always been a classic tale of ""taking someone as they are despite the glitz and glam of one night"" and this remake portrayed only some of that. The movie fell short of a lot of the original story that I was looking forward to and added a lot of fluff to stir up some commotion. In the original Cinderella, Ella's character seemed mature and honestly unbothered by the mistreatment from her stepmother and stepsisters, her vulnerability overpowered majority of the movie while trying to retain her innocent kindness that really read as weakness the entire film. The stepmothers role took on a more wicked personality showing a blatant disregard for the wishes of not only Cinderella but the King as well. Her easily manipulated sidekick the Grand Duke caved too easily to a threat leading our Captain to swoop in and save the day...clich√©.Don't even get me started on the ""fairy godmother"" who spoke as if Cinderella was supposed to know who she was or what she was capable of...her arrogant tone when it came to her magic was frankly irritating, and not humble like that of the original film.Cinderella was prided on its musical additions and this remake showed no accommodation for that. It was a ""cute"" film, just very far off from the original."
" It's classic and beautiful!
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,9,"I must say that this is the most beautiful Disney princess live-action movie that I've ever watched.
The storyline is still the same as we all already know, however the cast, the scenery, the CGI, the dress, the music, everything is perfect.
Lily James and Richard Madden are completely astounding!
Worth to watch!!!"
" ""The Gingers Three: Evil in the Kingdom""
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,6,"Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.I'm honestly concerned that this isn't a movie that anyone is going to watch again and again, but it's a solid watch, and a definite improvement over the 1950 animated classic, though I can't say this touches ""Ever After"" for me.The original story was somewhat lacking, but had fantastic animation for the time, along with voice acting and writing parallel with the movies of its time. I'm somewhat sad to say that is a fair difference in quality compared to modern standards.Disney very much kept this dumbed down for younger audiences, and I expect them to have more fun with scenes like ""lizard footman eats a fly"", but in the very least they steered away from realistic cg talking animals (a creepy factor in many of the live action remakes), though they do make a very specific nod to it at the beginning of the movie.While I do think they managed to improve on almost ever facet of the original, it certainly isn't without flaws.The casting is all over the place, which, I'm sure, affected the odd character development. Oddly, the less important characters, the men, in this case, are fine, I really have zero to say other than I rather like Nonso Anozie in anything he's in, and I did think the bit about ""Kit"" was a rather inspired thing.I understand that Kate Winslet has had a villainous kick the past few years, and she plays ""stuck up snoot"" very well, but seeing Helena Bonham Carter come in to give us ""the fairy godmother who ain't got time for dat"" really makes me wonder if they just weren't paying her enough to care. It would have made more sense to let Winslet elevate the fairy godmother (one of the only things that really wasn't) and let Carter goes Bellatrix Lestrange as the Wicked Stepmother.Sophie McShera did a marvelous job of making me hate her character, and Holliday Grainger kept making me see Katherine Heigl if we could keep her away from tanning beds, so they both did a marvelous job as wicked stepsisters (honestly, probably the best performances of the movie).For some reason though, they made a very strange decision to make all the wicked women gingers, though not with a very convincing dye job. I don't know if it was supposed to be representative of their tacky fashion and the ability to dye hair at the time, or if Disney really thinks gingers don't have a soul, but it was a blaring message, if illegible.What makes me think that they don't care at all is Lily James. She's lovely, she did a good job with the role as written, and I'm dying to see her in anything else to see if any of the oddities were her, or she's done just as good as Winslet with the roles they were given.Cinderella is traditionally a ""fairest in the land"" look, given that it's the middle of Europe, I imagine northern was exotic once upon a time, or at least certain people thought so she is traditionally very blonde and very fair. Lily James is neither (in this, despite some of the posters), so I thought they were taking a more Germanic look with a more honey colored hair....but it is also very oddly colored, and perhaps we wouldn't have notice if it wasn't for her very prominent BLACK eyebrows (which I have nothing against, I actually think they're lovely) which would have been simple enough to die to match. Alternatively they could have abandoned blonde altogether (plenty of versions do). It is just very odd to spend millions of dollars to do something purposefully (and repetitively) to make it look like they don't care and objectively make their movie worse.Overall, it's this sort of attitude that seeps into the movie at different points. It could have been a masterpiece, but instead, everyone knows it's a guaranteed paycheck on the title alone and made something that ends up being rather average despite itself."
" A masterpiece!
",2020-09-07 00:00:00,10,"I am shocked to see such a low rating for Cinderella because this movie is truly a masterpiece. Every actor, every scene, every costume, music, just about everything in this movie is AMAZING!
The Prince is breathtaking, those blue eyes and his smile... ohh. Cinderella is a gem on her own, and the Ball dress of hers is beyond imagining.
Please do not believe all those negatives reviews and watch this timeless movie that undoubtedly will bring out all kind of emotions, such as sadness, happiness, compassion.. It will make you smile, giggle or cry.
Believe me, It will make you believing in miracles again."
" A dreamlike world
",2020-09-03 00:00:00,7,"Glittering skirts and crystal shoes, these things in the girl's dream, were moved to reality by Disney, the film made a beautiful dream come true."
" Cheesy With Terrible Message For Girls
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,5,"I can understand wanting to do a ""post modern"" take on a classic. Stick to the fairy tale, make her sweet and loving, bring in the Prince Charming and the Fairy Godmother and the Magic, yada yada, happy ending. But this takes it too far. I know from watching ""Ever After,"" a far better telling of the story, that Cinderella can be a warm-hearted, kind girl who can fall in love and be vulnerable and romantic while STILL being strong and smart and red-blooded enough to feel anger, fight back, defend herself and fight for things that matter. This one is just a sappy, passive victim. Not just ""kind,"" but squishy and kind of a simpleton. For all her talk of having ""courage,"" she doesn't use any of it to protect herself or even the Prince for that matter. Toward the end when she is locked in the attic, presumably forever, she just dances in circles and hums to herself.....she ""isn't sad"" because she is just sustained by her memories of dancing with the Prince and her happy childhood! Oh, ok then! Her little rodent friends have to engineer for them to hear her singing, just like her Fairy Godmother had to get her to the ball, etc. Ugh. The movie is well-crafted and the acting is pretty good in terms of suiting the style and target audience, I guess. The (not so ugly) stepsisters are fun. The animation is well done, though there is too much of it and it just makes the whole thing feel phony and oddly claustrophobic. I thought the dance scene was well choreographed. But overall, it felt simultaneously over-stimulated and tepid. This is not the heroine I enjoy watching or would want my daughters to watch, even for a fun romantic escape movie. Also, while I certainly don't agree that the character or the actress who plays her is ""ugly"" as a few reviews said (seriously?), she's not particularly beautiful either. Generically pretty with nice hair (which probably isn't hers) and smile. I actually kind of like that because she's more relatable and it shows you don't need to be a 10 to be lovely and lovable. Still, I'm not blown away by the character's beauty or her personality. Or her clothes. The ball gown is a garish color. It's clear a lot of thought and work and MONEY went into it so it could and should have been a bit more spirited and memorable."
" this girl absolutely is no match for the Cinderella 1950.
",2020-07-12 00:00:00,1,"ONLY ELLE FANNING WAS THE PERFECT MATCH OF HER DISNEY CHARACTER THIS GIRL AND EMMA WATSON ARE THE WRONG CHOICES FOR THE ROLE OF DISNEY PRINCESSES. Emma Watson and belle are both beautiful but they don't match !!! same for lily James and Cinderella.
My heart is foaming when I compare the animation princesses and their actors."
" A perfect remake of the original
",2020-07-09 00:00:00,8,I don't understand what people expect out a Disney remake of Cinderella. The movie sticks to the story and core ideas of the original. Cinderella was written has a fairytale story and that's exactly what the movie conveys. THIS IS A PERFECT MODERN REMAKE OF THE CLASSIC FAIRYTALE STORY CINDERELLA. And I absolutely enjoyed it.
" a little simple
",2020-06-26 00:00:00,7,"I expected more from this movie, I was very excited when they said they would bring it to the cinema, they fell short."
" My favorite...
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,10,... of all the Disney Live action movies and of all the retellings of the Cinderella story.
" Its ofcourse a good movie but i expected some changes
",2020-06-15 00:00:00,6,"Well i really dont like any weak lady who cant protest against the ills happening against her.... tolerance can sometimes be stupidity .... i mean her stepmother sitting on her house and on top of her head ....its necessary to be kind but too much kindness is weakness as it was for her .... well i know it is how the story goes .... but i have seen other disney princess story remakes ....like maleficient (i really loved it) , beauty and beast and aladdin .... they have changed the story line a bit .... but i feel that is desirable .... i would have loved to see cinderella as a bold protesting lady in this story as well"
" Another dull, uninspired. aggressively boring remake
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,1,"I hold the opinion that every post-Maleficent modern live action remake of animated Disney movies is a soulless attempt at squeezing money from who are to one degree or another nostalgic for the original.
That by itself wouldn't be that bad, every remake wants to make money and by its nature preys on people's nostalgic feelings. However were all of these movies differ is that there seems to be no attempt to make an entertaining movie that can stand on its own.
Even making a shot for shot adaptation would be marginally more entertaining than what this movie delivered.For context I saw this movie because it was a friend's birthday. Her favorite princess is Cinderella.I am certain that she does not remember watching this film.What I got out of watching this movie was that it cemented my belief that Disney is making these movies on the cheap knowing that they'll get an immediate return and hope that people keep falling for the hype enough to make a fat profit. I've never met an actual person, including rabid Disney fans I'm friends with that have ever praised any of these live action remakes except maybe the original Maleficent (not very many good things about the sequel) which I consider as the only one to have substantially made any positive change .To sum up, take the plot points from the original. Remove half the cast (no talking mice in this one). Remove the song, remove anything remotely interesting. Add in some pointless backstory for the stepmother that told us, the audience, she's a bad lady and there you go. I can't say these are spoilers because every one of these remakes do the same thing."
" A natural rendering of a fairy tale without the sugar
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,8,"Probably the best version of this story made so far.
All the characters are believable and the ones we need to like are indeed natural and likeable.
The story makes sense for a tale of fairy godmothers and pumpkin coaches but it also plays well, with each action making sense within the narrative of the film.
I honestly didn't think I'd be saying all this for a live action film rendering of the cheesy disney classic but, here I am.
This is well worth the watch especially with kids and it doesn't deliver the dodgy gender politics of the cartoon version or try to deliver a woke sassy 21st century version, it's just a really well balanced enjoyable watch with characters you can like and respect."
" Truly magical
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,10,"I adore this film. It's so beautifully done. The aesthetics of the sets, the costumes are incredible! Especially the costumes worn by kate blanchett, Cinderella's ball gown and wedding gown were just gorgeous. The script is so lovely with lovely morals, especially 'have courage and be kind' which has really stuck with me, 5 years after I first saw the film. I am disappointed that it isn't more highly rated. Those who hoped this film would be similar to the original animation and are disappointed by it need to think of this film as an adaptation, not a remake. And enjoy it for it's alternative features rather than being disappointed by what they think is missing. In this adaptation I loved how we got to know the prince, especially as he had hardly any involvement in the animation. Kit's relationship with his father was so touching, I was in tears after their last conversation. Cinderella's relationship with her mother and father was enriching and emotional as well. Performance wise, Richard madden as always was captivating, charismatic and of course, charming. Lily James was poised, gentle and enchanting as well as stunningly beautiful. Kate blanchett was incredible, she was so convincing as the stern and emotionally scarred step mother. Helena was fabulous as the fair god mother, it is the first time I've seen her play a soft role and she did it well! She was fun, playful and kind. The inclusion of the animal friends was great, not as much screen time as the animation but just enough to keep you happy and increase the magic and spirit of Disney. Over all absolutely delightful film. It really fills me with a sense of wonder and leaves me feeling wonderful."
" A beautiful fairy tale
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,7,"The story is still an old story, beautifully dreamy, fashion design and art director praise, Cinderella transformation and dancing two scenes are too beautiful. Blanchett really steals the show, Lily James is also quite cute, Helena has less drama, but what other fairy godmother is as interesting as her."
" A gorgeous dream
",2020-05-07 00:00:00,7,"Pumpkin car, dance, costume, crystal shoes, all the elements in the fairy tale are restored by Disney, making many people's childhood memories come true. Thank you"
" Not terrible but boring
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,6,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. While it does fix some problems with the original animated movie, there's not enough to set it apart from other ""Cinderella"" adaptations."
" Only for Lily James
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,8,Though others things may be good but most captivating for me have been Lily james and her blue dress.
" This is torture
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,1,"The story is so slow and boring I was in pain. Worst movie I have seen in a while. Don't do this to yourself. Stop, please."
" Not sure how it could have been any better
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,9,"This film has a special placed in my heart as it was the first film I took my eldest daughter to the cinema to see. She was mesmerised the whole way through (standing up for most of it!). It is a fairly accurate direct remake of the Disney cartoon version but wisely reducing the screen time for the annoying animal characters and (perhaps not so wisely) removing the songs. It expands the earlier part of the story and shows how Ella became a servant to her stepmother and stepsisters logically. The sets, costumes and cast are all excellent and whilst sumptuous it is not completely over the top like the remake of Beauty and the Beast. Lily James is lovable but not in the sickly way the cartoon Cinderella was. Blanchette is fabulous, hissable but damned attractive at the same time. The ugly sisters are not ugly but provide some of the laughs. Madden is actually a Prince that is handsome enough for the role (loved his costumes) and as usual Bonham Carter steals the film in the 10 minutes she is on screen as the fairy godmother.For once the live action remake is better than the cartoon original and I was teary eyed at least 3 times Those who gave this a low rating probably didn't see it in a cinema with a little girl."
" Not bad but not good
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,6,First of all i enjoyed movie also Cate Blanchett was perfect.They didn't changed classic story which i also like.I think main problem was Cindirella as character was too weak.She is nice sweet poor girl in story but i think she also need something to make her more powerful for movie.
" Who is this for??
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,1,I really don't understand for what audience was this rubbish made. Children asked me to quit it after 5 minutes and adults almost vomit. Totally nonsense dialogues not believable and stupid.What a pity.

",2020-04-21 00:00:00,6,Disney's female villains are each more stunning than the last.
" Beautiful
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,9,One of the best shown fairytales out there. The beautiful scenary and the grest acting all work. The final project is an gorgeous movie that leaves an message. Would definetly recommend
" good
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,8,"Cinderella is one of my favorite fairy tales. First of all, thank Disney for making him into a live-action movie. I believe many little girls have a Cinderella fairy tale in their hearts. They hope to have a prince to marry themselves, or after their parents quarrel, they are afraid to find a stepmother who is as vicious as Cinderella's stepmother, and then lead the same miserable life as Cinderella.
The casting of the film is very successful, Cinderella's"
" The movie basically restored the story.
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,7,"Cinderella is one of the stories that little girls all over the world often hear in their childhood. It can be said that the movie basically restored the story on the basis of the fairy tale, from the casting to the scenes, costumes I think are satisfactory, a childhood dream is fulfilled. By the way, Disney's female villains are more stunning than each other."
" A wonderful love story
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,7,"It told us a wonderful love story. The poor girl, Cinderella, was ill treated by her step mother and self sisters. But finally, she got her true love with the prince.
It made me moved because Cinderella is such a brave girl; she doesn't care about the gap between her and her beloved one. I learn from it that miracles are often created by our own effort."
" Fairy tale.
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,7,"Beautiful costumes, romantic love stories, whether in animation or live action, fairy tales are always full of charm, especially the story of Cinderella's crystal shoes. Although the story has no particularly new ideas and surprises, I still like it."
" Everyone has a fairy tale in it. It is a beautiful existence.
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,7,"Cinderella is a beautiful story. The actors in it are invincible in interpretation of each character, which is a romantic film that people can remember well. Inside is the most beautiful. No matter how difficult it is, as long as you have a brave heart, any problem will become easy. Cinderella is a kind and beautiful girl. She is smart, strong and brave, innocent and kind. Do n't give up or give up. Even if we meet in such a dark time, there will be the day when the dawn of victory comes. And her mother and sisters are full of evil, even so Cinderella has always maintained a kind heart, and the prince inside is handsome and brave, but also compassionate. Cinderella and the prince are born in a pair, and should go happily, But Cinderella's stepmother didn't agree."
" Magical
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,8,"Without thinking too much about the animated original, this film was truly magical. Cinderella was never a favourite of mine, but this new version certainly is. The step-mother was given depth and background to her character. All the acting was brilliant. The story had emotion and had me in tears a number of times. It was just sweet and beautiful. Warmed my heart."
" Lily James is a great actress but not beautiful enough to play Cinderella (7.1)
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,7,"A very famous fairy tale that everybody knows, it is very difficult for this fairy tale to be a bad movie because the story is good any way a bad job can't occur when properly transferred.
The movie was fine I think it would be the most.3 rules should be in a fairy tale movie these are the best choices of costumes, the fact that the images take you to a fairy-tale world, you really feel inside that fairy tale and finally the casting team and especially the prince and the princess or the leading actors.
I think this movie was the only bad thing about actors the Prince is a little older and Cinderella is not very beautiful more like a normal girl but in fairy tale very beautiful.
I didn't like Cinderella in particular, but the movie was great in general, I watched it 3 times and never bored. and the director is good."
" Cinderella
",2020-03-27 00:00:00,7,I have seen the story of Cinderella in my childhood. It is simple and beautiful. I believe that good and evil will be rewarded
" Every girl has a princess dream in her heart.
",2020-03-23 00:00:00,7,"As a girl, all the childhood fantasies of princesses, all the glittering and beaded aspirations, were like stars on a blue dress, all starting with the magic words of the fairy godmother, ""bibbidi-bobbidi-boo."" I have seen the story of Cinderella in my childhood. It is simple and beautiful. I believe that good and evil will be rewarded. Many years later, the girl has become a mother, with her daughter to experience this dream country, warm and wonderful. Beautiful castle, good comely rilla, evil snobbish stepmother, silly and naughty sisters, ancient fairy godmother, handsome and elegant prince, beautiful princess dress and glass shoes, golden and magnificent pumpkin car... When I saw the words of the past leap out of the paper, and become three-dimensional and full of imagination, I also like a moment back to childhood, intoxicated in the fairy tale world."

" Great film
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,9,I'm a big fan of Disney princess movies. This movie completely fulfilled my childhood dream of being a princess. Cinderella's dress and glass slipper are so beautiful. The costumes of the supporting cast are super elaborate. I really love this movie.
" Beautiful dress
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,8,"Cinderella is my favorite fairy tale. It told us a wonderful love story. The poor girl, Cinderella, was ill treated by her step motherand self sisters. But finally, she got her true love with the prince.
It made me moved because Cinderella is such a brave girl; she doesn't care about the gap between her and her beloved one. learn from it that miracles are often created by our own effort."

",2020-03-17 00:00:00,10,"Disney's Live Action Remake of Cinderella was just magical! I loved the music, story, & great acting as well. Must see, especially with family or close friends."
" Typical fairy tale fare
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,6,"It's pretty much what you would expect. Although we all know the story of Cinderella, I was hoping for some plot or character twists that might make the story more interesting. One thing I really disliked was the interpretation of her mother's last words. Although a good message ""Be courageous and kind"", this was interpreted as ""Be a wimpy doormat"". You can be courageous and kind while still standing up for what's right. Cinderella unashamedly allows ""the house that her parents loved"" to be abused by obviously evil outsiders without saying Boo. What an insult to the memories of her parents. Mind you, unlike the traditional fairytale, Cinderella here is not a small child, but a young woman who was outgoing and popular in the village, so I am disappointed that she lacks any sense of boldness or justice. The CGI was adequate. Story is predictable. So in summary, it's a good light-hearted family movie where you can walk away with a smile. However, this is not a movie for you if you are seeking new interpretations or interesting plot twists."
" The best romance movie I've seen in a long time!
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,10,"This was a pure eye-popping dazzle. Lily James was pitch perfect for the role. The vibe was so overwhelmingly good, endearing and heartwarming.Courage and kindness."
" Disney's forced diversity agenda
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,2,"Writers and directors for Disney have to respect the source material and stop cramming black, Asian and Hispanic actors into European eras and stories which they are completely out of context. It's called ""cultural appropriation"", guys. It works both ways.Don't let your kids see this, show them the classic animated version. I took my daughter only really to see the Frozen Fever short on the big screen, we left when the diversity agenda of this terrible remake became apparent.Kenneth Branagh defiles everything he lays his hands on (Thor)."
" Stunning visually..
",2020-02-21 00:00:00,10,The set design and decorations were beautiful. The blue ball gowns' detail and the way it swished around with it's many layers was exquisite. The wedding dress was absolutely stunning with it's embroidery. This film was a treat for the eyes as well as being wonderfully performed.
" i love Lily James!
",2020-02-18 00:00:00,9,Lily James is very charming & beautiful portraying Cinderella. This movie has enough charm and heart I even cried watching it.
" Very bad
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,3,"What a disappointment I took with this movie, I didn't see the time it ended to rest from such visual torture, why do the classics hurt in this way? Although I have to say that Cinderella of 1950 seemed bad to me too but not as much as this.Really, the costumes were very good along with the decoration, so I give it a 1.Sorry for my English."

" A real farytale
",2020-01-11 00:00:00,10,"The movie is something else! Great cast! Lily James and Richard Madden were the best; they just made the movie more magical and dreamy. Every time I get done seeing this movie it has the same effect on me, I have seen it so many times and I never get tired of watching it! Guys you have got to watch this! The animated version is nothing compared to this movie. I also liked the fact that they outdid themselves with Ella's dress and that her hair was kept down instead of putting it being up in a bun like it was in the animated version.
The actresses who played the part as her step sisters did a great job as well as Cate Blanchett playing the role of the step mother. The crew who edited the movie outdid itself on the graphics, the magic was perfect! Thank you for making such a wonderful remake!"
" Cinderella Verizon 20.15
",2020-01-10 00:00:00,8,"(Flash Review)This 2015 version is a high quality and modern faithful telling of the classic tale. Stellar visual effects, striking cinematography, lavish costumes and opulent sets complimented with the fun magical transformation scenes make this a pleasant viewing. The acting was solid as well. This production will hold up to rewatching with your children. It does the original justice."
" Walt Disney would be proud!
",2020-01-09 00:00:00,10,I really like this movie. I really don't understand how some could give it one star? How could this movie not make you feel good? Lily James is terrific and the animation is at its best. One of my favourite Walt Disney Movies in years.
" It was a decent popcorn movie
",2019-12-31 00:00:00,6,"When I saw that the stepmother had found the glass slipper in the trailer I was excited to see where this would lead. I was disappointed. I don't know what I was expecting but her to simply want to strike a deal for her and the stepsisters wasn't it. Cinderella herself was such a goody two shoes it's honestly surprising she didn't agree. The one annoying thing is the constant overuse of ""Have courage and be kind."" Which in this films case translates to be a doormat and don't do anything about your living situation.In the animated Disney version, Cinderella was a child when she became an orphan. Her stepmother kept her confined to the property. She was isolated and alone with no one but birds and mice to rely on. She's likely never been beyond the property line in years and the ball is her one and possibly only chance to get out even for the night. Then the family rips her dress to the point of being unrepairableIn this one she was at least 16-18 when the father died. So she's often traipsing off to the market to meet up with a friend. A friend that literally asks her why she stays! Implying she could leave at any time. She wants to stay as it was her family home. A home she literally leaves in end. Also if she's upset about something she goes for a ride on her horse. Which is where she meets the prince. Which honestly makes his the whole I need to find my mystery girl stupid. Announce that the prince seeks out the pretty blonde he met in the woods.The whole dress scene is stupid as well. They...gasp, horror rip her sleeve. Instead of running off crying about it, she could have run upstairs sewed it back in a couple of minutes. Then tells fairy godmother not to change it much. Proceeds to completely change it.At the end of the animated one while locked up Cinderella tries to open the door banging on it and gets her mice to help get out.This one goes back to doormat status. Instead of trying the door begging, something. Nope sits down at the window and instead of opening it and calling out for help just sits there and sings. Only saved because the mice feel sorry for her and open the window. She never knew or seemed to care that the prince or anyone was there. And the care she had for dad's house she couldn't leave because of?Gone, forgotten off to the palace to live."
" Beautiful portrayal
",2019-12-12 00:00:00,7,"This was well casted and I loved the visual effects of it. The infamous transformation was perfection. I wished there was more Fairy Godmother (Helena Bonham Carter) as she was expectedly fabulous, but her part was disappointingly short."
" Only Live Action Remake Worth Your Time
",2019-12-08 00:00:00,9,"This was the one that started it all for the recent back to back Disney live action remakes. However, all the remakes that followed can't capture what this one did, nor hold a candle to it. The message throughout the film about the importance of being kind, patient, and good despite the circumstances is put to action so wonderfully. Everyone is fantastic in their roles, I loved Helena Bonham Carter as the fairy godmother - can't imagine any other actress bringing the proper whimsical quirks to that role. As recent films have shown, Disney has a habit of fixing old ""plot holes"" from their animated classics in the live action remakes. This one has that too, in the part where the prince is searching for Cinderella, as well as how the stepmother and step sisters don't instantly recognize Cinderella at the ball, but these little loose ends are fixed in such a subtle way. They're not forced or cheesily done like in the live action 'Beauty & The Beast.' I highly recommend this one, it was done in a really fantastic way. As my title to this review mentioned, it's really the only live action adaptation that Disney has made (in recent years) that's really worth your time. Wish they had accepted the success with this one and left it as their only live action from the decade."
" Beautiful and magical!
",2019-12-07 00:00:00,9,"I am a 48 year old woman and have seen Cinderella adaptations many times.
All I can say is that the little girl inside me loved it!! So did my 20 year old daughter that I watched it with. It was magical and beautifully filmed. The acting was superb. It was all that a fairytale should be."
" Cinderella is Back. Now in Live Action
",2019-11-21 00:00:00,7,"Astonishingly, Cinderella is a good remake. The changes to the original are so minimum but they add something like personality to the Prince Charming.The acting is reasonably excellent, and the visuals are as spectacular as Disney can do. The casting is on point for this movie, every one fit their role perfectly.Evidently this movie isn't a 10 because the second time you tell a story isn't as impactful as the first. The film just play safe by not being too risky so it's merely entertaining."
" A Fairytale worth seeing time and again
",2019-11-11 00:00:00,10,"I've seen some negative reviews for the movie and I've seen some positive as well.
I can't really add much more that what's already been said in favor and against.
But I can say that this movie is a great Fairytale that I have watched a half dozen times. And as a Fairytale goes, it can't be judged on realism. As I've lived the life of realism and its definitely no Fairytale. But I can say this movie brought this 49 year old man to tears at the end, because even a 49 year old man wishes for a Fairytale ending."
" Beautiful
",2019-11-08 00:00:00,10,"A beautiful take on a magical classic. A very nicely made movie in every way, topped off with a great cast.Honestly what more can I say? We all know the story and this is a fantastic way to bring it up to date and yet keep it typically Disney. Adored by my four year old, and myself too.The poor reviews prove that the world is full of heartless evil godparents that simply make the movie all the more magical."
" Magical and charming
",2019-11-06 00:00:00,10,"It's a more emotional and engaging movie than the original and one of my top favourite remakes of all time. Lily James does an excellent job of playing Ella ""Cinderella"". She sings excellently (as I found out in Mamma Mia 2) and she brightens up every scene she's in - a true joy to watch. She also makes the character very relatable and I was crying at several of the emotional scenes.
Cate Blanchett is perfect as the Evil Stepmother. As my brother put it - she owns the character. She brings a slight humanity to the character, but at the same time makes you utterly hate the Stepmother.
It has some similarities to Ever After, another adaption of Cinderella, but only minor and is different to all Cinderella adaptions that I have seen.
The Stepsisters were great comic relief and everyone does a great job in their respective roles. The movie even gets away with not revealing the names of some of the important characters.
The person who plays the Fairy Godmother (I've forgotten her name) is perfect for the role. She makes the character funny and lovable.
Awesome and amazing movie! Highly recommended."
" Next time get a blond...
",2019-11-04 00:00:00,2,"Might have been good with someone else playing Cinderella. I was so put off by the blond wig on an obvious brunette, it totally ruined the movie. While she may be a gorgeous brunette, as a blond, I just found her ugly."
" Great film
",2019-11-02 00:00:00,7,It is good and very fun ride to go on and really good cast with Lily James Cate Blanchett and others.
" A movie for the family
",2019-10-18 00:00:00,10,"A Disney movie that's easy to watch many times over. Lily James does an excellent believable job as cinderella, you can't help but just fall in love with her character. Cate Blanchett hits it out of the park as the stepmother, she portrays a whole new level of nasty. Well written remake of a classic. Disney should make more movies like this."
" Magical!
",2019-10-14 00:00:00,9,"Magical to say the least! Cinderella was truly magnificent. Like the beloved fairytale, Cinderella (Lily James) is a servant girl to her two ugly step sisters (Sophie McShera and Holiday Granger) and her cruel and unspeakably vile step mother (Cate Blanchett). However, when the king (Derek Jacobi) hosts a royal ball in order to find a suitable wife for his son (Richard Madden), who should appear but that servant girl dressed in a dazzling gown and glass slippers that were given to her by her very own fairy godmother (Helena Bonham Carter)? From the romance to the slightly altered plot, this movie was spectacular! The screenplay, although based off an old fairytale, still managed to be original and entertaining."
" I may be getting old and sentimental but I enjoyed this.
",2019-10-02 00:00:00,9,"I missed the opening but as soon as the father remarried to a woman with two daughters I knew what was coming. "" My kids and most kids hated it"" Really did you do a survey? I can only assume that the people who write those mean spirited and spiteful reviews are mean spirited in nature and they are likely to be raising mean spirited kids too! Maybe they should avoid watching
fairly stories altogether. This not a sort of movie I would normally watch, in fact I have not watched such a one since my distant youth, but I found it truly moving. The acting was skillful especially Blanchet's. The only odd note was the captain, I suppose it is obligatory to have at least one Afro American actor in a movie these days but I did not see any others! That is not to say he was lacking but one coloured person in a completely white society is odd to say the least"
" Well
",2019-09-20 00:00:00,2,"Okay First of all, I liked a couple of minutes of this movie despite the weird and uncomfortable use of dialouge. The First minutes because of Ella's backstory were the most descent, and the Prince is revealed to be with the royale troop at the moment when they arrive at Tremaine's house. The rest of the movie however is in my opinion Just a big mess, and Come on you never give a Prince a name like kit, at least not in a movie like this was."
" Beautiful Remake
",2019-09-16 00:00:00,10,"This movie by far is my favorite Disney live remake. The movie is visually stunning and captures the very essence of what makes Disney so magical. James, Blanchett, Madden and the rest of the cast were superb and Branagh hands down brought the magic ten fold. Best Cinderella (Barrymore's Cinderella a close second) film made to date and will remain timeless it was that well made."
" Enchanting
",2019-08-29 00:00:00,10,I loved it! It was charming and funny! Even though it's a small part I absolutely loved Helena Bonham Carter's interpretation of the fairy godmother.
" LILY JAMES WAS AWESOME!
",2019-08-10 00:00:00,8,"First of all, Lily James was awesome! Wicked Cate Blanchet damn. Probably one of the best adaptation of disney classic."
" Other DIsney money-spinner lacking style or enchantment
",2019-08-07 00:00:00,2,"Kenneth Branagh has inexplicably been chosen to take the helm for the latest in Disney's money-spinning line of live action versions of their classic princess stories.
You know the drill storyline-wise but special mentions go to Cate Blanchett and Helena Bonham-Carter who pop up (not quite enough, however) as heavily stylised manifestations of the wicked stepmother and fairy godmother of the piece.
Branagh hasn't done a Tim Burton, whose fairly recent retelling of Alice in Wonderland was dripping in his signature style, nor has he matched the dizzying enchantment of Disney's Oscar nominated fairytale, Into the Woods.
Cinderella is just a straight-up reissue of a classic children's story with perfectly charming actors, sets and costumes, but nothing by way of modernisation or reimagining.
The original 1950s animation had more by way of sassy one liners and a sense of mild peril, and if it's older children in need of entertainment, they're better off with one of any of the retellings of the last ten or so years involving dowdy waitresses/library geeks/bowling alley attendants 'rescued' by the seemingly unattainable jock/millionaire businessman/rock star.
Branagh's Cinderella seems more like a festive TV special than silver-screen worthy and it's now clear why Disney have had to tack an exclusive Frozen short film onto it as a trailer to lure cinema-goers."
" A Remake that Fits!
",2019-08-03 00:00:00,7,"Despite removing original elements such as the (character of the) mice & songs, Cinderella manages to ground itself as a thoroughly enjoyable remake. Adding a whole new segment of her early life and multiple scenes of the Prince with his Captain (best friend), and other alternations this remake also features a fantastic cast that help elevate the original material."
" My opinion
",2019-07-30 00:00:00,10,Wonderful film and fun and imaginary .. Every shot in the film was beautiful and charming Thank you
" Have Courage and Be Kind
",2019-07-28 00:00:00,9,"A lovely, sweet take on what is possibly the most well-known fairytale. The changes that were made in this adaptation were necessary and helped emphasise the storyline. I don't think anyone could have portrayed the innocence, wholesomeness, and genuine embodiment of Cinderella more than Lily James. The original movie is one of my favourite Disney movies of all time, and I believe the live action does both the film and the princess justice. The animated Cinderella is kind and compassionate, but also low key sassy and does her best to stand up for herself and never loses sight of her worth - and I appreciate so much how the live action Cinderella kept those same qualities, but added even more to her personality. I also really appreciate that both her parents are quite a big part of the film and help influence and encourage Cinderella to always be kind, no matter what.
Cate Blanchett was (not surprisingly) also phenomenal as the stepmother.
This is definitely a Disney remake done right, and is the only remake thus far that has the special Disney magic and doesn't feel solely like a cash grab."
" Love It!!
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,10,"This movie is simply amazing
One of the most beautiful Disney Movies come to live action in the best way possible, and Yeah I know maybe kids won't like this but adults can like this right?
It just a movie that brings us back to our childhood and i totally loved it"
" cinderella
",2019-07-17 00:00:00,7,"Disney did it again with this gorgeous live action remake.
lily James was born to be Cinderella her acting in this film is flawless and so believable and captivating. every single actor did there part justice in this film and not a single person stands out as being bad or even mediocre. the prince is so much more developed in this film we actually get to know him and more about his life and family. the chemistry between the two leads is absolutely breath taking. this movie is romantic, emotional. touching, magical and enchanting every thing it should be. this movie is just an absolute delight."
" A Great Remake
",2019-07-12 00:00:00,10,"This movie marks one of my all time Disney favorites. The visuals are great, the animation is gorgeous and the music is just fantastic. But of course, that's not all what's to love about it. Cinderella doesn't lack the heartbreaking feel as most movies would, and could bring most people to tears as it gives an explanation as to why she is called ""Cinder"" Ella. We get a clearer backstory of Ella's past and Cate Blanchett rocks the role as Lady Tremaine. Not to mention they've shown that even the prince deals with his own family issues unlike the 1950s version. A great remake, in my opinion."
" Disappointing, and the weakest of the live action adaptations so far
",2019-07-09 00:00:00,6,"To be fair, Cinderella is not the most complex or interesting in terms of plot or character development. This version is cute, beautifully created, and very family friendly. However, it was disappointing that the music of the animated version was not included, and it was an utter waste of Lily James as Cinderella that they only had her sing a song during the end credits. Take note, Disney- the iconic music of your films is a major draw, and not including it really diminishes the quality of your adaptations. Beauty and the Beast was way better, in part because of the music."
" The Yawn Machine
",2019-07-07 00:00:00,6,"Well, well. Where should I start? What should've become a major blockbuster, turned out to be a pretty big failure, in my humble opinion. I didn't ""get it"" and I didn't enjoy it, frankly. And as much thought I poured into it to better ""digest"" it, I just couldn't, simply because it all seemed so fake and I did not feel any fairy tale in all this children story. It almost felt like rubbish to a certain point to me. Don't judge, but I clearly say the truth. At least, let's leave it up to the kids to enjoy. I just guess grown ups like myself are a lit bit harder to please than these kiddos :)."
" A very different film from what you may expect...
",2019-07-05 00:00:00,9,"There are so many films based the Cinderella tale. I think one of my favorites is ""Ever After: A Cinderella Story"" from 1998. I figured this would be just another Cinderella spin film, but no, it's shockingly pure and simple, perhaps a metaphor for Cinderella herself, at least as she's presented in this film.It's actually this presentation that actually leads me to deduct one star. I had a little trouble inserting myself into the wold of the film. Except for perhaps one or two scenes, we're to believe she's some kind of perfect angel and it felt a bit strange. Is she a real girl or not?The ending pulled things together well enough and so I suppose almost all is forgiven..."
" Enjoyed every bit of the movie!!
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,10,"This Cinderella movie is the best, I love how her character is stronger than the old Cinderella we used to hear about. Great casting!"
" Amazing
",2019-06-04 00:00:00,10,"No one could have done a better job playing Cinderella, more so than Lily James. Lily brings everything a princess should be to the screen. Adding a magical twist to the usual blue ball gown, Cinderella went from one of my least favorite princess films, to one of my favorite princess films."
" Enchanting
",2019-05-28 00:00:00,10,"Just when I thought I was thoroughly sick of the endless reboots and remakes, Disney's 2015 Cinderella proved that Disney magic was alive after all these years. Classic story of courage, kindness, and love, produced with world-class writing (even if meant for children), direction, cinematography, music, and acting, featuring a spectacular castle dance scene and Lily James' radiant and alluring smile. Count me enchanted."
" Disney's Cinderella live action turned into something unwatchable.
",2019-05-10 00:00:00,1,"Cinderella is indeed one of my favourites when I was a kid and it still is. But when they make live action, it becomes very bad. Compared to the animation, live action is really really bad. This film might be a good one for the others, but for me, it's kind of unwatchable. There are a lot of things I don't like.First, Cinderella is beautiful and warm. But the actress from the live action is not. They should choose the other actress. If they did, I think the film might be better. Second is the performance. I noticed that the acting is really bad, especially the leading role, Cinderella. When she was acting she's excited, it's kind of the worst acting I've ever seen. I really hate that acting.Thirdly, the dress. The costume designer is the worst in the whole film. Cinderella's blue dress which is supposed to be Fairy godmother created. I mean the one who created that dress is fairy godmother. So, the dress should be the most beautiful dress. But that blue dress is very ugly. I can't believe that dress is made by fairy godmother. And also fairy godmother's dress is also very very ugly too. They should have put more efforts to the costumes.Changing of the story is acceptable, so, I don't comment on it. So, as for conclusion, I really had high hope for Cinderella Live Action film, but all I got was disappointment. Moreover, it is one of the worst films I've ever watched."
" Breath of ""Freshness""
",2019-05-02 00:00:00,9,"If you want a smiling heart. This is movie is full of an awesome adventure, delicate drama, fabulous fantasy, a sweet romance. The music is delightful. The visionary colors, costumes, are delicious. So refreshing to watch. Thank you, Lilly and Richard, and Kenneth for this sweet movie. The best left for the last comment, the entire family can enjoy Cinderella. Refreshing. Proud member of the juice box club at 65 years old."
" HAVE COURAGE AND BE KIND
",2019-04-17 00:00:00,10,"The movie gives us some background information on Cinderella (Lily James). We get to meet her real parents before their expected deaths. We also see her privileged life and education prior to living with the cartoonish step-sisters and overly evil step mother (Cate Blanchett) who enters the film with her own ominous sound track.The character of Cinderella is developed beyond the typical one dimension. She is a woman of character who knows right from wrong. She has been elevated from a kept woman or ""Cinderella principle"" to the woman behind the man. Hey, it's a start and step forward. The prince has wicked blue eyes (Richard Madden) that even a guy would have to notice. The fairy godmother (Helena Bonham Carter) was a Disney delightful character."
" Oy
",2019-04-09 00:00:00,3,"I appreciate that Hollywood is trying to cast non-stunning women as leads, I truly do. But as an avid Cinderella fan, I just had a hard time believing someone could fall in love immediately with dark brown eyebrows and bleached blonde hair. Cate Blanchett is a magnificent force and I feel for her that this script was so poor and her co-stars were so lacking. I waited forever to watch this because I had my doubts, I should have followed my instincts on this one."
" Cinderella Review
",2019-04-07 00:00:00,7,"You know this by now. An orphaned girl (James) is kept as a servant by her wicked stepmother (Blanchett) but shown a way out by a prince (Madden) and a fairy godmother (Bonham Carter).
This live-action take on Cinderella, which sticks closely to the Disney animation, is primarily for those who found Frozen a bit radical. It's for those who like a fairy tale where men are men (riding horses, bearing swords, wearing britches so snug they may imperil their paternal prospects) and every woman is an aspiring princess. Progressive it's not, but as a traditional tale it is well told and beautifully presented. Its lack of knowing nudges is almost radical.
In Kenneth Branagh Disney has found reliable hands, a director who can keep a story briskly trotting along and all the style in service to the content. He also has a sharp sense of humour and knows that if the setting is absurd, you don't have to lean too hard on line delivery for the joke to land. Where similar films like Mirror Mirror and Maleficent have strained so hard for camp the effort killed them, Branagh recognises the story is camp by nature and doesn't need further winking. Which isn't to say for a second this is subtle.
There are a lot of 'turns' in Cinderella. You can see the bite marks in the scenery, but the largely British cast nibble rather than gnaw. Holliday Grainger and Sophie McShera are despicable fun as the cruel stepsisters, looking like the Shining twins rolled through Barbara Cartland's knicker drawer. Helena Bonham Carter does her energetic Tim Burton pantomiming but with sparkling lightness instead of swivel-eyed darkness. Hayley Atwell has a good old faint before popping off as Cinderella's much-missed mother. They're at the tipping point of going over the top, and the film is better for it.
The main event, obviously, is Blanchett's devious stepmother. She isn't just given a big entrance, she's given a big entrance for every scene (there's one shot where she simply opens a door, but contorts herself into an arch that should require pulleys). Branagh has apparently riffled through every female star of the golden age and grafted the best to Blanchett. She's Rita Hayworth yucking it up with the boys. She's Marlene Dietrich glaring out of the shadows. She's Vivien Leigh smouldering from under outsized hats. She is also one of the characters for whom Branagh and screenwriter Chris Weitz have tried to find some depth. We get a monologue about why she's become so calloused and see her face harden at every mention of Ella's mother. That, thankfully, doesn't mean we're meant to sympathise with her. She's still dreadful, but dreadful with purpose.
All this noise and gesticulation makes it tough for Lily James and Richard Madden, as Ella and the Prince, to create an impression. Theirs are the least dazzling roles - Cinderella's arc is largely a makeover bookended by washing up - but they are endearing in their eternal optimism rather than tooth-rottingly sweet. The one nod to modernity is in making the mantra of ""have courage and be kind"" applicable to both leads. Most Disney fairy tales would not have a scene of the prince curled up, crying next to his dying father - a touching, smart surprise.
This is the Disney princess model of old with some new technology, but that's a formula which built a studio. If the gender politics don't make you grind your teeth then the light humour and sparkling visuals should keep you happy, if not ever after, at least for 90 minutes."
" A Fairytale to Remember
",2019-03-20 00:00:00,9,"Cinderella is certainly a truly beautiful masterpiece. It doesn't matter what other people say. No matter how old I am, I am going to cherish this movie. The costuming was beautiful, very elegant. I love the unexpected twists and how Cinderella saves herself. I did not approve much of the classic Cinderella story, because the prince needed to determine a shoe size to determine his true love. But this movie, it shows that true love comes in any kind of love, and it's just an amazing, simple but elegant story."
" absolutely magical, a flawless film
",2019-03-06 00:00:00,7,"A glittering, stirring surprise, Cinderella is a sophisticated and engrossing retelling of the age-old fairy tale. Cast, designed, and assembled gorgeously, the fantasy quickly and completely captures the eye and imagination of its audience. It is a thoughtful, lovely, and effortlessly enjoyable piece of work.
A lavish film that pops with joy, warmth, and just the right touch of clever archness. A fantasy whose appeal seems unceasing and whose richness is expansive. A treat for all audiences, Cinderella is a singular delight."

In my eyes, a bad version of this story has never been made.

" Forgettable
",2019-02-03 00:00:00,4,This movie is just the same version of Cinderella that we have heard so many times it didn't really feel very inventive
" great film!
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,9,"The 2015 Cinderella improves its original in every way possible. From Lily James' performance to the minor yet tremendous plot changes, the film's story pays off in ways I didn't expect. Add on some gorgeous production design and an underrated score by Patrick Doyle!"
" Surprisingly pleasant
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,10,"I was never much into the whole Cinderella story, no matter how it was told. Sure, I know the story because I read it when I was a kid, but it never impressed me.However, I really enjoyed this movie. I don't care it's clich√© (most fairytale are), I don't care it depicts the classical story (I despise ""original"" remakes anyway).What I do care is that it's well played, it has good costumes, good effects, good lines and if the actors are also beautiful (which they are btw), than all the better. :) Besides, Cinderella ought to be beautiful, otherwise she wouldn't be Cinderella. :)And now I can't believe I waited almost 4 years to see it. :)"
" An Uneven But Lavish Spectacular Fairy Tale
",2019-01-15 00:00:00,7,"17 March 2015. Oddly enough, this visually epic, lusciously presented live action version of Cinderella has its amazing moments but at the same time inconsistent tonal qualities. Without the traditional musical accompaniments, this famous fairy tale of the movie must depend on a superb script and directorial expertise to maintain a grand fairy tale extravaganza quality. Yet at the beginning of the movie there is more is presented more as a period piece than a fairy tale and the tempo slows way down with lumbering exposition and dramatic license that takes some of the magic away from the movie. The fusion of both substantive live action drama along with the lighter fantasy elements are uneasily blended together.It is the amazing magical moments between the lead characters, Cinderella and the Prince that the true inspirational fireworks explode into a compelling experience. The opportunity to flesh out the evil stepmother and stepsisters is sidestepped which would have been more consistent with a more dramatic and fully developed fairy tale. Johnny Depp in Finding Neverland (2004) offers up the nicely balanced serious but lighter tones that would have provided the solid foundation on which to present this more lively version of Cinderella or to have gone with a musical live version that would have allowed the music to enhance the fairy tale experience like Craig Ferguson's created in his written, directed, and starred in ""I'll Be There"" family drama that included both fine humor and music.In some ways the magic of the fairy tale nature wasn't there as the live action family drama at times became more pervasive even as the overly heavy use of the narrator attempted to keep that storyteller flavor intact. The movie might have also been better if it had been structured more like dramatic and seemingly magical ambiance of The Secret Garden (1993) a period movie about a young British girl who is forced to live his uncle or Hugo (2011) rich visually period piece of historical fiction about a boy who lives in a railway station. Of course a live action version of Frozen (2013) about two princesses one who has apparently magical powers approach would have been intriguing to attempt. Personally Drew Barrymore's Ever After (1998) retains the strongest presentation of the live action fairy tale."
" Fairytale is still alive
",2019-01-04 00:00:00,9,"Cinderella has always been my favorite fairytale of all and this Disney version is on target with Cinderella's famous blue ball gown, magical transformation of animals to coach carriage, coach man, footmen, glass slipper. I think Cate Blanchett's performance as the evil stepmother is a accurate portrayal including her callous, stolid personality. Yes, good things happen to good people as there is karma. Watching this movie again and again makes every girl dream of one's own prince charming. I also like Lily James's singing of ""Lavender's Blue (Dilly Dilly"" in a cappella in its original form as a nursery rhyme. This is a very sweet romantic movie."
" Adults should be happy with this too...
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,9,"Disney's 2015 mainly non-animated work famously draws on the firm's 1950 full-length cartoon feature, and in this sense is now for most potential watchers ""the"" version of the Cinderella story. That by the way means that we are here spared such hideous touches present in earlier versions as Ugly Sisters seeking to remove digits in order make the glass slipper fit, and so on.Indeed, here Cate Blanchett's portrayal of the Stepmother is delicious without being extremely malicious, while the sisters - also well-portrayed (by Sophie McShera and Holliday Grainger) - regularly become more figures of fun than evil; selfish and pushy as they may be. They're not THAT ugly either!The film is then ""safe"" for children in these respects - no ""Shock-Headed Peter"" this! Indeed, we seem to have more of Ruritania here than either classical Greek, sophisticated French or at-times cruel German cultural influences (these being the three apparent historical sources of what is a well-loved if now much-constrained tale).However, given British filming locations, Brit Director Sir Kenneth Branagh and a largely Brit-cast from Sir Derek Jacobi through to Richard Madden and Helena Bonham-Carter, to say nothing of Lily James in the starring role, one might detect a suffusion of Britishness here, though rather little of any more raucous pantomime tradition. Nevertheless, Jacobi and Bonham-Carter, and indeed Nonso Anozie in a very sympathetic role as Captain of the Guard, offer regular episodes of tongue-in-cheek British humour, while not letting the gravitas go - a fine line tread successfully, then, and one that attests to the fact that these are great or gifted actors fun to see in these roles - as of course are Blanchett, and indeed Stellan Starsgard in a slimy ""Grand Duke"" part...The question already being answered by the above concerns the amount of fun adults are going to get out of this film, as and when they accompany their kids. And the main answer is ""quite a bit"". Naturally, Lily James herself is highly eyecatching in the role, and indeed the actress's slightly unsophisticated beauty fits the bill perfectly. Possibly-correct and well-known criticisms about the actress's somewhat Barbie-minus, corset-induced waistline (which had James herself and Director Branagh fending off attacks) seem somewhat suitable for being played down in the overall context of the film. There is plenty else to look at in these scenes and deft parents should perhaps be ready to deflect on to them, should the need arise. But anorexic it isn't!The romance is a step away from soppy, but it keeps that correct distance, and can indeed look touching or inspiring for those willing to be ""young at heart"". Likewise, the way (Cinder)Ella is portrayed as the epitome of all goodness might easily have looked ridiculous and jarring - not least when set against the world-weary meanness of the Stepmother and others - but this is not so, and all credit to James for that. She is to convey a supremely nice and good person, and this she does. Whether that actually leaves the portrayal more rather than less erotically charged is one for watching dads and elder brothers to ponder in their own minds, but the overall effect would seem to be to keep the story moving forward pleasantly and warmly enough for all concerned.Innovations may be in somewhat short supply here, but the design often looks sumptuous, and the lizards-into-coachmen and mice-into-horses transformation scenes are fun enough.Somewhere inside we are all kids at heart, and Branagh's Cinderella will have most watching adults recognise that fact, while never abandoning entirely a more adult take on the film that also brings its own rewards. For me, it's a winner."
" Bibidi Babibi Boo !!
",2018-12-18 00:00:00,7,"Not my favourite Disney cartoon pic but I liked this version much more, it's more real, cause we all know that animals don't talk! LOL! Yes, we all know the story by heart and if you had a childhood I bet you've seen the 1950's cartoon version, so you shall watch this one too.The story is (almost) the same as the cartoon one but is has been changed a bit. We get to see Cinderella's mother and we get to see that she met the prince before the ball, which it makes more sense. Cause would you marry someone who just met at a ball and dance with them for like one minute? NO! Here they story is more developed, which is gratifying. There are no talking animals, but the mice are still there in their way. We get to see the iconic pumpkin scene, wich is quite hilarious by the way and also the iconic ball scape scene which I think is brilliant made, cause if you are on one side of the castle and the exit is at the other side of course you must run all the way!! Not simply puff, appear at the exit.If you pay attention you will observe that there is a colour pattern for all characters, like Cinderella always wearing Blue and her sisters pink and green (like in the cartoon). Moreover, all things have bright colours which make it all more magical. Then, there is also the music, some tones form the original version and new versions that will keep you humming through all the film and after (not like a Let it Go kind of thing but still).As for the performance, Lily James is terrific as Cinderella, cannot imagine anyone else playing her, plus, this Cinderella is more independent that the one of the cartoon version (thank god). Opposite here the is Cate Blanchett, who as always is awesome in her bad-ass stepmother role! So could please keep giving her mean characters? Then we have Rob Stark err I mean Richard Madden with his brightly blue eyes as the Prince who is definitely charming and we can forget the part where he falls for the prettiest one( if only for one second!!).Above all, that the cast is mainly brits gives it last touch to this classic fairy tale and for 100 minutes you will forget about anything else. Just go and watch it your kids, they'll love it, and the adults will too.Review written: 22/03/2015"
" Deasapointed
",2018-12-17 00:00:00,6,The only drink good in this movie os the performance ir Cate Blanche.
" This is how you do a remake
",2018-12-11 00:00:00,10,"Cinderella is one of my favourite Disney cartoons and this movie do good justice to it.They maintained the taste of the original cartoon and they combined it with something new and more modern. Visually stunning, both for the bright costumes and for the rich environments. The costume design in particular is truly amazing. It doesn't address an accurate historical period, but is inspired by the style of the 40s.The whole movie looks like a theatrical adaptation of the cartoon. Kenneth Branagh definitely knows how to do adaptations due to his long experience in theater.The only thing I didn't like is Cinderella's ball look (and her horrid eyebrows). She looks like a blonde Scarlett O'Hara going to a picnic. I mean, the dress is beautiful, but it doesn't do justice to the elegance of the cartoon's one. A higher hairstyle would have been better (like the one they chose for her wedding).Apart from that, I can't help myself to give a 10 to this wonderful product. So far, the best live action movie based on a Disney cartoon."
" A somewhat decent remake, with very nice visuals.
",2018-12-05 00:00:00,6,"This remake is nothing special. I mean, it does add and extend certain things from the original but it is very meh. The only thing I liked about the film is how they handled the prince. He does have somewhat of a personality now than the original. The cinematography and visal effects are quite good. But, even though the original 1950's animated version was simple in story, the gorgeous animation and backgrounds made up foe it. So, I supoose if you want to see a somewhat decenr live action adaptation of cinderella, this is the best so far. But, if not, I's give it a skip."
" A good movie, but still unnecessary
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,7,"Cinderella is fine. It's a good movie, but it's still unnecessary. This live-action version doesn't really add anything to the story. I thought the cast did a great job, with the exception of Helena Bonham Carter - I'm not a fan of the insane fairy godmother - and I think it was visually appealing, but overall if I want to watch the story of Cinderella, I'm going to choose the classic Disney animated version."
" Not impressed
",2018-11-21 00:00:00,2,I was disappointed from the start with the casting. I don't think Lily James is pretty enough to be Cinderella! Don't know how she got the part. Kind of a lavish flop. I love Ever After's retelling of the story. Much more probable and a strong female lead.
" an updated take on the disney classic
",2018-11-13 00:00:00,10,Review: I loved this movie because it is a great companion piece to Walt Disney's 1950's classic of Cinderella. The team behind this movie successfully brought this iconic story and cartoon to the life without using any CGI. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Sorry the Shoe doesn't fit
",2018-10-25 00:00:00,6,"Despite some great costumes and Lily James's performance. Cinderella feels like a retread of the classic original and as a result has me wanting to watch that more than this one. However if you want to see some great performances from James and Blanchett I'd say it's worth a watch, but it doesn't hold a candle to the original."
" This film is for my future children
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,10,"I loved this film. Although I hated to use the word- it is lovely. I really enjoyed the bravery of Cinderella and her determination to find good in all situations. She is quiet but kind and a perfect role model. The special effects are not overdone and beautiful.In a world where being silly and bizzare is celebrated - like Anna and Rapunzel (which is not a bad thing), it's lovely to see the old classic fairytale being revived. I hope more follow suit"
" Old classic with modern look
",2018-09-18 00:00:00,8,"Before I begin my review, I must state my ""Cinderella bias"": There is a Czechoslovakian version of Cinderella from 1973, called Tri Orisky pro Popelku (Three Wishes for Cinderella). It is different variant of this ancient tale than the Disney version. To this day lot of Czechs and Slovaks consider it ""the best Cinderella"", it has aura of timeless classic and has benn broadcasted on primetime every Christmas Eve in last 10-20 years, attracting millions of viewers each year. For long time it's been the only Cinderella I've ever seen. Sure it's nice, but I never understood why so many people love it sooo, sooo much. When I came across Brannagh's Cinderella, I happily expected something different. Well, characters in this version are weak (but that's typical for many fairy tales), Cinderella seemed to me a bit too extroverted and cheerful, her stepsisters could've played bigger part in the story. But the cinematography is fabulous, central duo is immensely loveable, the music is nice, and Cate Blanchet does fine job as a stepmother. My only problem with this movie is Cinderella's passivity - I liked more the dynamic, provocative approach of the ""czechoslovakian"" Cinderella. Anyway, I was really happy that even in 2015 someone can take old traditional story and recreate it into modern, beautifully crafted movie, yet still keeping that tradition in it's heart. From now on, this is my favorite Cinderella. Well done!"
" Be kind and have courage
",2018-08-30 00:00:00,10,"Be kind and have courage was the moral to this film adaptation of the original fairy tale. I won't go in depth and there isn't a real need to give any spoilers because if you have ever read, had the original fairytale read to you as a child then you already have all the ""spoilers."" This was an original fairytale brought to the big screen. There isn't some modern day twist, a different perspective but just the wholehearted goodness of the fairytale I loved as a kid. It was a reminder that though we may suffer if we endure with kindness are day will come. Cinderella isn't just about landing the Prince, it was about being kind and having courage even to those who don't treat us as they they should. If you have gotten to cynical for this concept or no longer can enjoy the original fairytales you heard as a child or worse didn't hear fairytales as a child this may not be for you."

" MUST SEE!
",2018-07-19 00:00:00,9,"This is the exact same story. Though that is a negative, (and made me remove a star for its rating) I still loved this movie. Why? The story is told in the best way possible"
" Extraordinary!
",2018-06-28 00:00:00,7,"What an extraordinary, exceptional film! This is simply magical and enchanting, and quite simply what fairy tales are made of. The classic tale comes wonderfully to life with a very good cast, great director at the helm, and incredible visual effects. The dress transformation scene is spectacularly done! The costumes are stunning, and the entire production design is awesome. Lily James in particular is excellent as Cinderella. There are a few lessons to be learnt here, and it is done impeccably without being melodramatic or over the top."
" Loved it! Loved it! Loved it!
",2018-06-20 00:00:00,9,"Lily James is becoming one of my favorite actresses. She can play it all, and i've seen her in everything she's been in to this point, she's a phenomenal actress. Branagh really out did himself with this film. What a magnificent direction of film with absolutely perfect timing at every moment of the way to bring a smile to your face or bring a scowl to your face with Cate Blanchett's brilliant performance. A wonderful gem that stays true to the original animation version. 
Do yourself a favor and watch this treat, you you won't be disappointed."
" One of the better live Disney remakes
",2018-06-10 00:00:00,8,"I didn't get a chance to watch this one in theaters, but I did rent it and enjoyed it. It's a nice spin on the original and it takes some creative liberties, but otherwise it's not too predictable and there were many scenes I did not see coming. I enjoyed the original but this was even better. It's good for those of you who don't care for animated movies and wanted a live spin on the original fairy tale. Sure, the names are almost the same but it's good for a new generation. There are some parts that were different from the original fairy tale (before the animated film) but it's still good. It's also one of the better live Disney remakes out there, along with The Jungle Book and Pete's Dragon."
" Favorite Cinderella story!
",2018-06-07 00:00:00,10,The costumes! The storyline! It was all true to the original fairytale and yet the actors that portrayed Our beloved characters brought new life to this old story!
" A safe but colourful retelling
",2018-05-20 00:00:00,6,"Kenneth Branagh is tasked to bring Disney's animated version of Cinderella to life. What Branagh brings is extravagant costumes and a colourful rendition of this fairy tale classic.Ella (Lily James) is a kind hearted girl but after her mother dies, her father remarries the vindictive, selfish Lady Tremaine (Cate Blanchett) who has daughters Drisella and Anastasia of her own. After Ella's father dies Lady Tremaine cruelly treats Ella as the maid and her two stepsisters tease her. One day Ella meets Prince Kit Charming (Richard Madden) in the woods where he claims to be a lowly apprentice. The prince is taken in with Ella's beauty, kindness and charm.When Kit organizes a grand ball for all the maidens in the kingdom one of whom he plans to marry. Ella attends with the help of her Fairy Godmother (Helena Bonham Carter.) The prince who is enchanted strives to find the maiden who left one glass shoe behind.The film has an icy performance from Blanchett dressed up in haute couture costumes with just a hint as to the reasons why she is so vengeful against the world.Cinderella benefits from nice production values, a good blend of CGI and live action but it is still a well worn story. There is very little that can be done with the familiarity of the story though."
" Worst than the original, seems that was made in 1920
",2018-05-17 00:00:00,1,"Yes, at least on the original disney movie cinderella, she was smart, adult, strong and she did fight for her happy ending! She called her friends, she ran with the other shoe, and proved who she was. The prince didnt come to save her, she did it herself with her friends.This movie is just stupid, omg, it's so stupid i can not describe this without laughing.... In this movie.... Cinderella WAITS to be saved while she sings... like an autist kid. It's just weird and pointless.When we do a remake of something, we expect do make some updates, like the values. wake up... the original cinderella was made in 1950!!!!!! Shameful, a 1950 cinderella has more useful and modern values for girls than a 2015 cinderella."
" Ive never really liked Cinderella
",2018-02-19 00:00:00,5,Lily james is really really really anoying as Cinderella not very good humanisasion of the cartoon characters. and quite a bland adaption
" A superb live-action remake
",2018-01-28 00:00:00,10,"After a young, kind and beautiful girl remains without both her parents, she is left in the care of her merciless and greedy stepmother who transforms her into a servant. Although forced to live a harsh life, Cinderella always remained kind and courageous, in hope of a magical act which might turn her life around. This said, a charming apprentice she meets by accident in the woods might just be what she deserves. This real action remake of the original Disney animation is a wonderful demonstration that it can be done if you keep the story, present it seriously, hire a couple of good actors who know what is to be done and get a bit of help from a very talented animation team. Add to this mix a good soundtrack and you end up with a very good movie by itself. Yes it is a very good remake and yes, it is a very good movie without having to mention the Disney animation with the same title. Do I recommend it? Without any doubt!"
" Depends on your personality as to whether you will enjoy or not
",2018-01-03 00:00:00,9,"It has many similarities to the original DISNEY version, with some variable changes that I felt enhanced the film. I am not surprised at the poor reviews, as these days there are too many platforms for opinions to please everybody. I LOVED this movie and found myself buying it a week after watching it on cable. I loved the CGI, the cast, and felt it enhanced the magic of the 1950s Disney film version. I enjoyed Ever After (Cinderella film), but it did not feel as magical as this version. Cinderella was a favorite movie of mine, but not my favorite. This is my favorite live adaptation of a cartoon (and yes, I quite enjoyed Malificent - Sleeping Beauty remake). I loved it and it's possible you will too. If you are hoping for a new plot twist, or it being based on ideals that resemble (or should) reality, then maybe this isn't for you. If you are picky about things, like Cinderella having a small waist or other superficial things, maybe you should stick to a different type film. Nobody I knew who has seen it was bored once during this film, but I can see why it could be for people with different interests or ideals. If you really can't spare a couple hours to check out the film for yourself, but you have an hour or two to spend reading reviews, then perhaps you really aren't interested in seeing it after all. Nobody can tell you whether it it is good, but you....or maybe someone exactly like you. Hope you enjoy the film too if you do watch it! I loved it!"
" Missed opportunity
",2017-12-28 00:00:00,4,"CINDERELLA is another in a recent series of live-action versions of Disney's animated classics. The unknown Lily James plays the protagonist here, the put-upon stepsister at the mercy of her cruel stepmother who catches the eye of a handsome prince and utilises the magic of a fairy godmother in order to win his hand. The weird thing about this film is how unenjoyable it is. The main thrust of the story is skimmed over in haste while added-in sub-plots involving Stellan Skarsgaard's random bad guy character are given way too much screen time. James is a simpering and uninspiring protagonist - it takes more than adversity for a viewer to warm to a character, and the scriptwriter should know that - while Kenneth Branagh contributes zero style to his direction. Even worse is a one-dimensional stereotype turn from Cate Blanchett and the actresses playing her daughters. Richard Maddern's prince is all teeth and eyes and no personality, while the less said about Helena Bonham Carter's cameo the better. Add in some unimpressive CGI effects and surprisingly 20th century-looking costumes and you have a generally poor attempt at a classic fairy tale."
" 8/10
",2017-12-11 00:00:00,8,This sweet good-natured film is practically a live action version of the original Disney animation. it improves the original by making Cinderella a bit more outspoken. And of course the visual effects are excellent and add to the magic. Cate Blanchett is good in a villainous role with a hint of complexity. Some may feel a bit let down by the fact that most scenes are repeated from the original. Still its a pleasant and at times magical experience.8/10

",2017-11-09 00:00:00,8,"This is Disney's live-version of its animated featured film, and retells the classic story of the kind maiden in rags, Cinderella, who is mistreated by her stepmother and stepsisters, all while dreaming of a joyful life of her own.I liked how we get to see a more in depth look at each character, particular the close relationship between Cinderella and her parents, and the events that led to the cruelty and coldness of her stepmother, Lady Tremaine. The Prince also played a larger role, as we get to see his relationship with his ailing father and his first meeting (besides the ball) with Cinderella.All the characters were quite memorable, including Cinderella's animals friends, though they are given a much lesser role in the movie. I particular liked Helena Bodham Carter's portrayal of the Fairy Godmother - charming and whimsical.The beautiful cinematography and visual effects made the film enjoyable, though, I could have done without some of the characters in the film including the Prince's right-hand man, and wished the stepsisters were given more screen time. Some of the scenes were also a little rushed, including the scenes where Cinderella does her chores and the infamous dress-ripping scene.Overall, a nice Disney film. Magical and dramatic at the same time.Grade B"
" Beautiful story, beautifully told
",2017-10-08 00:00:00,8,"This tale of Cinderella is not only entertaining but a brilliant study in jealously, insecurity, and being true to who you are. Young Cinderella is much loved by her parents and before her mother dies she is given the advice ""Have courage, and be kind"". Cinderella takes these to heart. After her father's sad death she is faced with fear and cruelty on a daily basis from her step-mother and stupid, spoiled daughters. How Cinderella deals with the irony of her situation in comparison to what her parents were like, is part of what makes the story line so entertaining. The movie is beautifully shot, with great care taken with costumes, colors and overall theme to each image. The actors play their roles with style (albeit Cinderella herself is a bit flat) and Kate Blanchet is restrained yet deeply malevolent in her role as the step-mother. Cool beauty with ice in her veins, a true Disney villain! How fun! The restrained approach to the personified animals in Cinderella's world is true to Disney's idea of ""probable improbability"". This is a movie that could be watched many times over and always be entertaining."
" Style over substance but it's worth it
",2017-09-27 00:00:00,10,"OK I have to admit this is a film with great style but not much substance and yet I loved it.The original Cinderella is one of my least favorite Disney romances for how plain it is and nothing has been fixed here in that aspect but it's almost impossible to fix Cinderella so not much complaining here. Nothing they would have done could have worked.But what it lacked on substance was compensated by great style and the getting the perfect actors for each role.for the first time the actors they picked for Cinderella and the prince look like people coming from a Disney Fairytale.Lily James is such a beautiful actress with a lot of Grace and Richard Madden is really dreamy and well Charming. Cate Blanchett was very well cast as the very classy but evil step mother and so were the actress picked for the evil step sisters. Now the spectacular visuals and the scenes which made this movie a masterpiece. Looking like real Disney Fairytale. 1 Ella Meeting her fairy godmother and preparing to get to the Bawl Elena Bonham Carter was a great pick to play the fairy godmother who was very funny at being not that expert on her magic and having a few mistakes at the beginning giving it some humor to that scene.The transformation of the mices To horses and lizards to human beings were just perfect Ohh and the transformation of the dress was jaw dropping, you see Cinderella being impressed and feel like she was in a dream having such a beautiful gown which does look like one made for a princess. The glass sleepers were the perfect touch to such a beautiful dress. The Bawl scene it was more than perfect. Cinderella arriving, kit recognizing her and their dance just perfect. The chemistry between them and the way they dance looked effortless. Just that scene scene gives the movie 8 points. Cinderella and Kit had great chemistry you see them happy and enjoying every single second they were togetherLast but not least. Cinderella Trying the glass slipper and proving she was the girl who danced with the prince to latter them getting Married and Ella having another beautiful gown which makes her look like a Disney princess. As you can see This a film completely saved by three great moments which make you feel The Disney Magic and why it gets a 10/10 even if the story is a dull and plain as they come."
" A timeworn twice-told tale. I almost fell asleep.
",2017-08-15 00:00:00,8,"Disappointing. A forgettable musical score. Even the oddly cast Disney multi-cultural video is superior. As much as I like that production, I believe that ""Cinderella"" has to be a fair-haired blue-eyed blonde! Other actors can be anything they wish! Good performances by all in this 2015 ""remake"" so I can't quite figure out just what's missing here. Walt Disney used to call it ""heart"". As a ""film"" collector, I have both versions of ""R&H Cinderella"" (which are both videos), Disney's animated classic, and ""Ever After"" with Drew Barrymore. Plus, I have seen ""The Slipper and the Rose"" as well. (It's also excellent, but it's a bit too operatic, with ballet dancing, for kids.) Here, both her mom and dad die, mercifully, ""off camera"". The most redeeming quality is the great over-the-top Fairy Godmother pumpkin coach and animal transformations (and after Midnight un-transformation). Where is my ""Bibbity-Bobity-Boo"" song? Yes, the chattering mice, lizards and goose are too cute and very well done. There is just not as much surprise here, as the Prince remembers meeting her in the forest and therefore shouldn't have had that much trouble finding her? The new Beauty and the Beast movie (2016) is just so much more captivating and ""alive"". At least there is no ""chunky"" Fairy Godmother here. Whitney Huston could barely squeeze into her costume, so many years ago!"
" A Stunning, Wonderful Movie
",2017-07-21 00:00:00,8,"Kenneth Branagh did convinced us with a fresh retelling of this Disney's 1950 masterpiece with a heart and soul.Lily James did a good job of portraying Cinderella, best part is Cate Blanchett in which she delivered a stunning performance and at the same time, can do scene stealing too.Still, there are flaws within this movie, they still need to convey more depth as there are things in the movie, it get too cartoon."
" Disney's Most Beautiful and Crucial Live-Action Adaptation
",2017-06-23 00:00:00,10,"There are SO MANY adaptations of the most iconic fairy tale of all time, whether it takes place in modern time and stars Hilary Duff or Selena Gomez, and of course everyone knows the original 1950 animated Disney classic. Disney is bringing many, MANY of their most iconic animated films to life on the big screen, and I'll say this: if they can all be as good as Kenneth Branagh's Cinderella (2015), then please, Disney, continue making them.Cinderella (2015) stars somewhat newcomer Lily James, who could not have been more perfect as Cinderella (Ella); Cate Blanchett as Lady Tremaine (Wicked Stepmother); Richard Madden as the Prince (Kit); Helena Bonham Carter as the Fairy Godmother; Derek Jacobi as The King; Holliday Grainger and Sophie McShera as Anastasia and Drisella; and Ben Chaplin and Hayley Atwell as Ella's parents. This movie, and I cannot emphasize this enough, truly brought to the screen the MAGIC of 1950's masterpiece. I truly don't believe that any other actress could have been more charming in the title role as Lily James. This really was the first time I've seen her in a movie, and I became an instant fan. Her voice (singing and speaking), mannerisms, charm and beauty make you wonder if she really is born into a family of royalty. She was everything Cinderella is supposed to be, and definitely a wonderful role model to young ones. The chemistry between Lily James and Richard Madden was like Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, well, a family version, they were so perfect for each other. Cate Blanchett and Helena Bonham Carter were so wonderful (of course), the whole cast gave tremendous performances. I loved how we learned and sympathized a bit more with Lady Tremaine overall.Now, the highlight of course of any Cinderella movie is the ball, or maybe the transformation. I can't even describe how beautifully the movie executed Ella's dress transformation, you feel like you're in the air, dancing along as her moment of freedom grabs her. And Sandy Powell, wow, that blue dress, I hope that she continues working more and more on the best films, which she mainly does; that dress was literally another character in this movie, that's how magnificent it is; I have never seen a more beautiful dress in my life, this dress is going to be a major part of film history.This is (in my opinion), Disney's best live-action adaptation of their classics, some may argue The Jungle Book (2016) is, but I'm going with Cinderella (2015), it has such great messages, especially for kids about having courage and being kind even during the worst of your sufferings. Why is this such a spectacular movie? Because anybody with a heart will want to commit an act of kindness after watching this movie."
" Much better than expected
",2017-06-18 00:00:00,7,"I didn't expect to enjoy this film as much as I did, having not really liked the original cartoon version that much.But this was a pleasant surprise as Kenneth Branagh manages to not only retell a classic fairy-tale, but to tell a good story in general. It's a story about family and hope, and those are all very important themes to cover.I thought Lilly James was good as Ella (Cinderella) and that Helena Bonham Carter did her normal kooky woman act well as ever. Quite what Rob Brydon is doing here I don't know, but hey.I'm not overly convinced by Disney's latest trend of making live action versions of their cartoons, but this one was impressive."
" A beautiful improvement of the original fairytale
",2017-05-29 00:00:00,9,"This movie is what the original Cinderella SHOULD have been. It provides excellent backstory and is much darker than the at times silly cartoon. Ella is more of a believable character in this version and her extra encounter with the prince prior to the ball is very poetic and wonderfully done.I had never seen Lily James in anything else before and I honestly hope that this leads to a wonderful career for her, she deserves it. She was a truly beautiful Cinderella and portrayed the poor, optimistic girl perfectly. The expressions on her face spoke volumes, almost more so than the actual dialogue. Very moving.It goes without saying that Cate Blanchett was an incredible wicked stepmother, but I will say it anyway. She was chilling at the part, at times it was jaw dropping just how cold and cruel she was to poor Ella. I thought the step sisters were wonderful as well. They were exactly what they needed to be. Stupid, cruel and selfish. The complete opposite of Ella. I really liked the origin of how she came to be called Cinderella too. Very telling of her terribly tragic life.This movie will make you wish that you were closer with your family than you probably are. Ella's love for her parents who pass is palpable and your heart breaks with hers when she loses them.Her chemistry with the prince was great as well as their exchanges of dialogue. I love how she basically nags him the first time they meet, such a nice modern twist. Whereas in the original cartoon, he simply sees her across a crowded room and deems her the most beautiful woman at the ball. This version gives Ella more substance and shows that the prince is intrigued and appreciative of her unique personality and not just her stunning features.Helena Bonham Carter is fabulous as The Fairy Godmother, just as she is in everything else. The visual effects of the dress and all of the magic are absolutely dazzling, very well done.The only reason I am not giving this a perfect score is because I really wish they would have dropped the mice for the live action version. I really felt that they cheapened the seriousness of the story and that their presence pretty much made Ella seem like she was losing her mind. In the cartoon it was whimsical that she enjoyed dressing and singing to mice, but in the live action version I found it just strange and sad. I wish creators would realize that certain things just do not transfer well from cartoon to live action. But that was my only issue with the whole movie! This film is a definite must see for people of all ages, especially those who believe in true love and happy endings."
" More Emotion and Humor Than the Original
",2017-05-27 00:00:00,10,"The original Cinderella film when Disney was fairly new had less feelings, humor, and talking involved. Sure, this 2015 version of Cinderella's personality has her weaker. But, she goes against her Stepmother's wishes in a politely pathetic way. Richard Madden is a stellar performer in the sense that he can alter his facial expression, vocal tone, and move in a way that is believable to me. Then, you have Cate Blanchett who has a stunning physique that entraps me into her gaze... almost. Lily James, on the other hand, needs to branch out towards broader roles to show people she is capable of portraying various characters in different lights to me. The father of this film was made by an actor that did enough as much as they could given that they had a very restricted time in doing so unlike the more main characters that were more focused. Helena Carter did a splendid job in playing as The Fairy Godmother as she always is handy dandy when acting on set whether it is a cinematic or theatrical one to me. I felt more humanity was put into this film because of the work that Kenneth Branaugh did. Also, Patrick Doyle, the music coordinator, gave me satisfaction within this film. Patrick and Kenneth usually work together, so I assume that is probably why this film worked from those 2 people's familiarity with each other. Otherwise, this film is top notch overall. Some people may not think so and put negativity within the midst of anything Disney-related. I sense negative vibes of Disney are growing, because some people are becoming ""jaded"" from seeing all there is to see in the film business from it being 2017."
" Cinderella 2015/2016 : Another Wonderful World from Disney
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"I read some the very negative reviews and came to this conclusion.....These people went to the movie but didn't really see it or they didn't even go to see it and just created a Trollish (and very short) review with no substance to it at all.First off. Too many Cinderella remakes? Well, guess what? It'll be remade probably 20 years from now too. What does that have to do with how good or bad it was? For that matter,who cares? ""Disappointing indeed"", is something another said. What are the ways it was disappointing? No explanation,just an empty opinion.""It is made for kids only and not for adults"". Really?! I'm 46 and my girlfriend in her 30s. We saw this last night and enjoyed it just as much as the kids and (guess what?) their parents were enjoying it too.A girl losing both of her parents? How in the world is that ""for kids only""? I was amazed they dealt with it that directly and in a very mature manner, without making it too disturbing for very little kids.""This movie was so boring."" Okay again,""how"" or in what ways was it boring? Just another blanket opinion.""Nothing new?"" It's a re-make of a 200 year old story,they have to tell it in mostly the way it was written but they did add something important, they gave all main/central characters real human qualities and emotions and even back-stories about who they are.CGI animation & special effects are amazing & seamless here. The costumes and attention to how people would dress in that era is flawless. Every actor in this film is 100% into their role and best of all this movie ""does"" have heart,otherwise there'd be nothing to like about it.A rip off of others or a ""copy & paste"" job : There's only one real storyline for Cinderella and that's (again) from the original story & book itself. Director Orlando and other filmmakers did not create Cinderella. He and they only made their own versions.As for some alleging ""Disney steals ideas""...aside from ""a few"" Cinderellas made before 1950, Disney pretty much made the definitive and animated one that year. Any later versions are remakes either good or just okay.In case any haven't heard ,the movie industry is 112 years old,there's only so many ""fresh"" ideas anymore.""The acting is/was so tasteless"". What is that statement based on? There's nothing tasteless in the film at all. As for acting, does anyone really think it's easy to play such a ""nice girl"" as Ella and balance that against all the negative things happening to her? I'm not in show business but I certainly know the difference between a boring film and a good ,fun and entertaining one. This movie ""is"" a good movie,it has every element that it takes to be so.Good actors, good directing,a well fleshed out script based on something already done before. ..and again, incredible detailed costumes and sets & again great special effects, that bring the illusion of that time period to life. The music score is excellent as well.About the feminists. Ella is a very strong girl and then woman. To put up with all she did and went through after her parents passed on, is a testament not only to being a strong female but being a strong person in general.I say that as a man raised by two good yet strong women.It's far too easy for people to be negative in a review here on IMDb. It's easy to see, some come from just from wanting to be mean and negative because they want too,not because they actually saw the film.Making a bad or boring film is a very easy thing too,when all involved don't make a real effort and just want to make money.It takes a better use of one's mind to create a movie (and remakes) like Cinderella and have it be successful and as well done as this film.Ten stars? I'll give Cinderella (2015) twenty! An AA++ and 100% perfect score. I will say and add that this movie will be an Oscar contender at next year's Academy Awards.Anyone who rates it less did not open themselves up emotionally or even mentally to just enjoying it for what it is and always was & will be....a fairy tale. (END)"
" Well, it looks pretty...
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,3,"Well, to start with, I don't think this story's premise is unfamiliar to everyone, but this version tosses in a new message: ""be kind and have courage at all times"" which the title character keeps repeating throughout- even though she is really neither brave, nor even really kind unless it's to the mice she keeps feeding. Nope, instead this Cinderella is just a pushover and also kind of an airhead who actually starts calling herself ""Cinderella""- a cruel nickname her evil stepsisters came up with to mock her, thus truly giving her ""evil"" step-siblings power over her. This Cinderella also has a weird, wide-eyed expression throughout the movie as if saying ""you're so mean to me, but I'm such a good person I'll take it"" to everyone who does her wrong. I'm not sure if that is Lily James' fault, or the writing. For me, the best re-telling of the ""Cinderella"" story is ""Ever After"" with Drew Barrymore. In that film, Cinderella IS actually both kind and brave, saving the prince's life and even using a sword to fight her way out of a sticky situation. The bravest thing Cinderella does in this film is not wear any makeup in front of the prince. If you're looking for a better Cinderella re-telling, I'd recommend ""Ever After"" or even just stick to the original animated film since ""Ever After"" uses no special effects or CGI to create magic.The film does look very pretty, and costumes and sets are beautiful. However, it relies far too much on CGI, if you ask me. Acting-wise, Cate Blanchett is by far the best thing about this movie, then of course she is pretty much great in anything. Lily James, IMO, is just not a very good actress and not charismatic enough to have a lead role in a film. Also, I wonder who decided it was a good idea to put her in a blonde wig without dyeing her very dark eyebrows? That looked strange to me. Richard Madden as the prince for me just did not work.All in all, I'm glad I watched it since I got to see the great scenery, costumes, and a great performance from Blanchett. However, I wouldn't watch it again."
" I actually really enjoyed this movie.
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,8,"Sure it's still got some of the dated gooey-ness of the original movie, sure Shrek's impact on savaging the Disney/fairy-tale formula can still be felt years after release, but Cinderella is a beautifully directed and cinematographed; and Kenneth Branagh did this? Why do films like this exist in today's industry? Well franchising for one thing, and even though films like this are basically products in Disney's pipeline it CAN be well done given that the movie's got a determined director at the helm. And oddly, Branagh, the guy who directed films such as 1996's Hamlet, was just the guy to make Cinderella into a watchable film. It's pretty, has a good cast and has some nice tid-bits of humor here and there. And it's an update on the whole Disney-esque 'happily ever after' thing. Yes the story's the same but it gives some much-needed chemistry to Cinderella's and 'The Prince''s romantic charm. And... it works.You don't need to be a girl or a gay to like this film; just see it for what it is: a harmless remake of an animation from the 1950s."
" Has the original version of the fairy tale gone out of style?
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,8,"This movie has been very poorly understood by the public. Unlike previous films, which seek to rewrite traditional fairy tales or watch them from new perspectives (""Maleficent"", ""Ever After"", or even the animations ""Brave"" or ""Tangled""), this film is the live-action version of the fairy tale in its more traditional version. Therefore, we know the whole story and very little has been changed or added. Any problem? Not for me. I usually like original versions more than any contemporary re-interpretations, but it seems that fairy tales have gone out of style.One of the criticisms I saw was the Cinderella's passive attitude: the girl was educated under values of kindness and generosity (something our current society no longer knows) and isn't willing to abdicate these principles in adversity. Maybe she think that would betray her mother's memory. For our society, which treats the dead as unknown and the living even worse, such submission and servitude is unacceptable! The oppressed must revolt! Cinderella shouldn't serve the tea, she should take that teapot and stick it in her stepmother's throat! Or should she kick her feet and whine, saying ""I don't do it, I'm sick of it""? If you are reading this and you're also think that Cinderella should revolt, then you're one more who has totally forgotten what a fairy tale is. A fairy tale is not about reality or what we do. It's about moral values and what we should do. And the moral teaching conveyed by this tale is that biblical passage ""turn the other cheek"", that you must have heard in Sunday School if you have frequented it. Cinderella's tale is entirely about this! She had the courage to silently endure her suffering and to forgive those who hurt her and, in the end, her reward was to fall in love with a prince and change her life. Her stepmother's punishment didn't delay: she ended up punished, but not by the person she most offended. Moral of the story: love your enemy and forgive, you will have the reward, sooner or later.Well, the movie is great and is absolutely true to the original fairy tale, including with regard to costumes and sets, which are beautiful. Unfortunately, CGI is too obvious. I would have preferred realistic sets in proper locations rather than the green screen, which should be used with more caution. I have seen some criticism about the large neckline of Cinderella's dress but, in the historical period in which the tale was set (19th century), the ball dress were usually very low-cut. But don't complain! We see women with even fewer clothes on our streets today and we find it natural! Lily James and Cate Blanchett are the main actresses of the film and it is their work (as stepmother and stepdaughter) that supports the whole plot. Blanchett, unsurprisingly, shone with her usual charm, and the veiled but venomous malice she had bestowed on her character. James is an actress I didn't know but I liked to see, having done her work quite well. It's a young actress, surely this movie isn't going to be the movie of her life, but she left a promise of talent that may come to blossom. Helena Bonham Carter and Stellan Skarsg√•rd also enter the film in supporting roles that their talent makes it seem easy.This movie will easily please all those who want to watch a movie with the original Cinderella story. It's absolutely the same as the book our grandparents used to delight our childhoods. However, if you've gotten tired of it and prefer a modern version of the story this movie is not for you."
" great film!
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,8,"Love this film! no it is not like the original but it is great in it's own way! The prince is more developed as a character, the step-mother is still great, and Cinderella is great too. I think this Cinderella is more quiet and with that a quiet beauty and strength comes through her and it really shines. I love this movie and I will always love to watch this one and the original one."
" Nothing new in this movie and very lame characters, but plot is alright
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,6,"The trailers for this movie made the Cinderella seem extremely annoying and a really bad actress for the movie. However, the movie itself was not as bad. It is disappointing that it is just a remake of Cindrella with no other twists, turns, or interesting ideas. I'm not sure why so much money would be spent on a literal mimic of what's already been done. It could have been so much more interesting with an actual change of plot, etc. Also, the character choices were very bad, especially the fairy godmother. She was wearing disgusting, naked clothes that are inappropriate, the makeup wasn't even nice and soothing, but garrish. It's like they couldn't recreate them to look like the time they belong to, but instead, made them look like today's morons. Cinderella was an annoying character and the juvenile 'be kind, have courage' was also annoying, because it is not applicable in the world. This movie should have been new and different. *6/10*"
" Stepmother portrayed with modern depth
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,9,"Although this is about the stepmother, I want to first say that I found all the characters well portrayed and supported by an excellent script, cinematography, and of course a great director. I scanned some of the user reviews and for all those giving a very low rating it seems to me that they missed the essence of Cinderella - it is not supposed to be an action nor hard/boiled tale that apparently even some children want today and should not become such.I particularly appreciated the stepmother's portrayal because it included clear justification for her anger and bitterness. Not to say given that justification she was correct to have done what she did. But a worthy lesson for us and particularly for children.The specific scene I am referring to is when she overhears her husband telling his daughter how much he misses her mother, i.e., where is the love and support she desires - a more modern understanding of the difficulty of joining an existing family. This and other related scenes gives the stepmother a depth that makes her more real in place of the one-dimensional cartoon version - but what a joy that version was for me many years ago."
" Disney Excels Again
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,10,"My disappointment was hearing that critics had found fault with this work of perfection.The characterisation has been thought through carefully and the temptation to make caricatures of the step-mother and her daughters consciously resisted.The retelling of ""Cinderella"" (apparently known, in the 19th century, as ""Cinderslut"") with the benefits of modern techniques and processes is impeccable.Often, films that are 'great works' suffer from some minor weakness or other, a detail not followed through, a hasty bit of editing, a clipped or overly long scene but never did I feel that could be said about Disney's film. ""TLC"" (tender loving care"") from beginning to end.True to Walt's original intentions, here is a film for all the family (well, some teenagers may want to wait a little).Good luck, it's great to see memorable films making it to our screens."
