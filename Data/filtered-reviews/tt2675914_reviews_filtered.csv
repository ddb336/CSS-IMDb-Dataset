" A little strange but beautiful
",2021-02-05 00:00:00,8,"A kind of mix of excellent camera work in terms of landscapes and some light images with cold, like a city in the mountains plot about the revenge of a father who has lost his son. In terms of the plot and the behavior of the characters, I still have some doubts, but in general I really liked the film."
" interesting but the humour does not fully translate?
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,7,"If have seen the remake of this and enjoyed both films.
We could ask if it is a remake if it is by the same director?
Anyway this is a revenge drama set in Norway.
It is a gangster film perhaps but also has the feel of a western.
I feel sure that if I spoke Norwegian I would find the humour funnier but still it is both funny and very violent.
I enjoyed this more than other films where I have seen more than one version,I usually lose interest cause I know the story."
" Superb
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,10,"Absolute pleasure from beginning to end. Did not disappoint in any respect. Brilliant acting from all involved. Perfect mix of revenge drama, thriller with darkly comedic moments and twisting plot, tempered by loss. Pretty Shakespearian and definitely 10/10"
" Gard B. Eidsvold has done it again!
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,9,"It's Norway, and Ingvar has been murdered because of drugs or something! Nils is grief-stricken and confused until Finn provides a clue that leads him to Jappe.Questioning Jappe leads Nils to Ronaldo, who tells him where to find Strike.A brief but eventful interview with Strike reveals that Greven is responsible for the killing.Marit is angry with Greven. Greven is angry with the Albanians.Nils visits Egil, who advises him to hire the services of Kineseren. Huyen is upset by this, but it's a moot point because the plan goes awry when Kineseren visits Greven, who is still angry with the Albanians.Greven arrives at Egil's house, and it doesn't end well. Greven tells his men to kill the Albanians.Marit visits Greven to shout at him, and it doesn't end well.Papa is angry because Greven has kidnapped and killed one of the Serbs. Greven realises this was a mistake, and orders his men to kill Geir. A henchman brings Geir's head to Papa, and it doesn't end well.The Serbs plan to kidnap Rue, but Nils kidnaps him first and sets up a meeting with Greven that doesn't end well.This witty contribution to the Nordic noir/dark comedy/vegan genre will delight and amuse viewers of all ages.I rate Kraftidioten 29.97 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as an uncompromisingly brutal 9/10 on IMDB."
" Very dark but somehow still entertaining and funny movie of snowplow driver who wants revenge
",2020-02-25 00:00:00,8,"Movie has some very absurd elements that are both disgusting and funny, those remind me of Bad Taste. I believe both movies represent dark humor? This movie is much more darker movie in a sense that it doesn't have any hilarious tone in it. It has sad story and it is melancholic from start to the end. It is not exactly horror movie like Bad Taste but it has a lots of killing and blood so it shares some of the brutality. Thankfully it also had a happy ending, otherwise it would have been too dark for me. I wasn't fan of all acting performances but in the end movie managed to be good in a very challenging movie genre."
" Immigrant Executions
",2019-11-02 00:00:00,6,"This original Norwegian picture, ""In Order of Disappearance,"" and its English-language remake, ""Cold Pursuit,"" both directed by Hans Petter Moland, are largely the same dark-humored revenge plot set against a wintry landscape, but besides being original, this one has some other slight advantages. Mainly, the immigrant and racial theme is better executed here than in the Americanized version.Indeed, in my review of the later production, I didn't even think the topic worth mentioning. Here, however, the protagonist, played by Stellan Skarsgård, is specifically claimed at one point as a good immigrant (presumably from neighboring Sweden), as well as being honored as ""citizen of the year,"" while the Serbian mobsters and the Danish-and/or-Japanese hitman are attacked by the native Norwegian gang. In adapting this nativist dynamic to America, the supporting racial minorities were appropriately changed to an African-American hitman and a rival Native-American gang; consequently, however, the same dark humor and criticism of nativist politics didn't crossover effectively. Partly, that may be because the USA is a ""nation of immigrants,"" and the slaughtering of Blacks and Native Americans is too historically resonant to be played casually or for gallows humor. There also seems to be more racial epithets spewed by the gangsters in this version. More so, however, this theme didn't work in the remake because of the casting of Liam Neeson, who besides bringing his own action-star baggage since acquired from ""Taken"" (2008) and similar flicks with him, further mired the movie in his public persona with the admission of his real-life history with racially-charged revenge plotting. And, he was supposed to be the hero.Another comparison between the original and remake are the references here to American fiction, from the protagonist's reference to books about Indians, to the ""Wingman"" ""Top Gun"" (1986) (the latter shared with the remake), while the drug lord's nickname in the American version, in turn, is ""Viking."" Additionally, in both movies, the snowdrift settings underscore the themes of murderous civilization surrounded by an also-harsh wilderness. One related gag here involving how nice Norway prisons are was conspicuously dropped in the American translation, for the obvious reason that American prisons aren't that. Anyways, I'm not well versed in Norwegian cinema, but its Swedish counterpart has long been well regarded for its treatment of nature as a character--since even the beginning of Swedish films in the 1910s and 1920s by the likes of Victor Sjöström and Mauritz Stiller (both of them likewise immigrated to Hollywood). These two Moland movies seem to share the same Scandinavian tradition."
" Norwegian Native Art!
",2019-10-17 00:00:00,9,"Warning/disclaimer: you are not likely to find a very objective review here. The author is tremendously biased because he loves everything that has to do with Scandinavian countries; - and Norway in particular. He loves the country, the people, the language, the culture and most notably everything they did in the domain of cinema and television. When he found out about a vigilante/revenge thriller set in the snowiest regions of Norway, the high rating and favorable comments already were as good as established...Still, even when trying to remain skeptical, I can't find anything negative to write about ""Kraftidioten"", a.k.a. ""In Order of Disappearance"". The plot may be simplistic and quite derivative, but this gets massively compensated for via the sober atmosphere, the stoic tone of narration, the subtle dry humor, the genius character drawings, the astounding filming locations, ... Let's see, what else is great? Oh yes, the phenomenal performances of the ensemble cast, with Stellan Skarsgard in the lead. Nils Dickman, a calm and introvert plow driver with an unfortunate last name, has just been awarded with the title of ""Citizen of the Year"" in his quiet and peaceful community. But then tragedy strikes, as his 19-year-old son Ingvar is murdered - by mistake, in fact - by the local drug cartel. Since they made it look like a simple overdose, Nils is the only person (including his wife) who believes Ingvar's death wasn't accidental and sets out to avenge his son. Rather amateurishly but efficient, Nils begins at the bottom of cartel's hierarchy ladder and works his way up. The killing Nils does unwillingly ignite a gang war between the Norwegian drug lord and their Serbian associates.Admittedly, we've all seen this plot numerous times before, but the simple fact that it's Norwegian makes it unique and refreshing! Also, writer/director Hans Petter Moland adds a few splendid little gimmicks, like displaying the name (and nickname) of each newly deceased person on a black screen with a cross. ""Kraftidioten"" is also really, really funny in case you like your humor pitch black and dry as the desert. Personally, I laughed very loud with the dialogue about snow and bad weather being the reasons for a country's prosperity. That scene could have come straight out of Quentin Tarantino's pen, actually. The constant battling and bickering between the merciless gangster and his ex-wife, principally about the custody of their son, is fantastic as well. You don't immediately expect this type of situations happening to relentless criminals, but it's very original and downright hilarious. ""Kraftidioten"" often gets compared, especially around this wonderful website, with the work of the Coen brothers (evidently with ""Fargo"" in particular) and the aforementioned Quentin Tarantino. I believe Moland's film stands entirely on its own, but obviously there are far worse people to get compared with in the film industry. And, for once, I'm also really looking forward to the Hollywood remake, because Moland remained the director and because Skarsgard's role is reprised by none other than the amazing Liam Neeson."
" Apparently it's a black comedy
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,3,"So this apparently is supposed to be a sort of Scandi-Noir comedy! The plot may be based on the dark subject of drug dealing gangsters and murder, but some of the casting is so poor, and the 'comedic' elements so farcical, that it ends up simply as a bizarre mashup of sinister characters played by totally un-sinister actors, and dead pan 'comedy' that really isn't that funny. Overall very disappointing as it could've been a brilliant thriller with the right actors and a better script."
" My Comparison
",2019-06-28 00:00:00,8,"I am watching it after Cold Pursuit (2019), a remake made by same director.
The good thing it really feels like different movie. Both versions are simetrical but not identical. There are some famous actors presented and acting overall is good.
But Cold Pursuit has amazing music score that creates captivating atmosphere. In this version music does not do a thing to me.
Again the 2019 version expands in each scene and frofounds the movie. I not only had chills and thrills while watching it, but a good laugh too. Both protagonist and antagonist have more diverse personalities. In this movie all the characters are pale and singlesided. Even Eskimos character and Chinese character are not comparable.
Well... Even though it is a good movie, I would recomend 2019 version, and do not bother with this one."
" froot loops
",2019-06-16 00:00:00,10,"This movie is extremely engrossing, touching and even funny. Couldn't take my eyes off of it. The froot loops scene was hilarious. Greven is a crime lord and the mother of his child says he shouldn't have custody of their kid because he feeds him froot loops! Even funnier is he goes beserker over the accusation."
" Superb scandi noir
",2019-06-10 00:00:00,8,"This is an underrated gem as far as I'm concerned. Dark, understated humour at it's absolute best in a stunningly shot revenge drama. This is one of the few films to successfully blend a mounting death toll, drug cartels and extreme violence with laugh out loud comic moments. The cast are all brilliant.
Some reviewers struggle with this style of bleak comedy but we Europeans love it. It is closest in comic style to something like Death at a Funeral (the British one) or In Bruges. I cannot really understand the fashion for American re-makes of comic classics like this, The Intouchables or even the aforementioned Death at a Funeral which is in English (?) and doesn't even have subtitles. Comedy is quite specific to the situation and I highly recommend seeing the originals first."
" Exceptional 10 Stars+ Revenge Movie - Perfect Actors - Excellent Storyline - Loved It
",2019-05-13 00:00:00,10,05/12/2019 Words cannot describe how well done this Scandinavian pay-back movie is. All actors make it seem like real life especially the snow plow driver. It's so good that you won't want it to end.(Viewer immersion guaranteed.)
" Better than the Hollywood
",2019-05-12 00:00:00,6,"Better than the Hollywood remake, especially the coolness of the show. However, the structure of the whole film is still unbalanced, and multiple lines are combined and there is no fusion point. In this respect, the school is covered by Guy Ritchie."
" Very good!
",2019-05-03 00:00:00,10,I highly recommend this movie. I recently watched Cold pursuit (which I also enjoyed) and was reminded of the original. I just to had to see it again and it was better than I remembered it to be. It is on Netflix and I would not miss the it. The bodies will pile up but it is funny as well. Enjoy!
" Top notch action film that entertains to the core.
",2019-04-21 00:00:00,10,"I decided to watch this film yesterday since I had watched Cold Pursuit, its official English-language remake starring Liam Neeson, which turned out to be one of my favorite films of this year. And since both movies were directed by the same man, Hans Petter Moland, I decided to give Kraftidioten a watch and I was impressed, easily.Despite of having known the story, I was gripped till the end. There are certain things it does better than CP, while the latter too outdoes it in certain other ways. Kraftidioten has a fast pace and is filled with tension and action. The black humor feels more hilarious than that in its remake, even though some really hilarious parts in CP are better. Cinematography is impressive as it captures the snowy scenery with finesse. Sound editing and background score are both impressive.Stellan Skarsgard delivers a powerful performance, and so do all other cast members. Moland has handled his characters very well and has made sure we get invested in them. The film is far more suspenseful than CP due to its tension-inducing background score which the latter lacks, maybe for some right reasons. And since it's an action film, it delivers great action sequences too: in the right time and right amount. There are some really outstanding scenes I wish the director had included in CP. Those scenes add a lot to the film and its characters.If you have seen neither this film nor its remake, I'd still suggest you watch both of them. Your first priority, however, may differ since the pacing and editing is better in Kraftidioten while Cold Pursuit features more stylish and better action sequences. Nevertheless, Kraftidioten or In Order of Disappearance is a masterpiece of the black comedy-action cinema. Check it out ASAP."
" Unique-a variety of tones in a superb setting
",2019-04-12 00:00:00,7,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!Here is a true little gem of a film, which seems to be pretty much flawless from start to finish, and should be enjoyable for people wishing a different type of ""revenge"" story formulae than what has plagued Hollywood (and the subsequent script doctoring) for the past few years.Set in what can only be described as a breathtaking real snow-covered Norwegian landscape, between rural areas, slight suburban-like areas, and more cosmopolitan one, the film features amazing cinematography which utilizes the most out of real snow (no CGI for the most part) and the unpredictable visual ""ballet"" that snow removal and snow plowing can provide. The photography alone and in itself should be commended.Casting is simply brilliant, from our main characters to our second-and-third characters. Granted there isn't much room for deep emotional or character development in stories such as this one, but there was obvious care in choosing who to portray which role, and each actor makes their performance memorable, from the most subdued and toned-down subtlety to the almost over-the-top over-acting. Stellan Skarsgård is obviously perfect (as he always is) and delivers a performance worthy of being enjoyed, especially in the very subtle nuances some of the scènes showcase. Special mention to Hildegunn Riise who turns out a haunting performance as Nils Dickman's wife, another example of subdued acting speaking volumes.There is no denying the overt humorous tones of the film, or rather the deadpan dark/black humour the film delivers, be it in slight situational moments, character quirks and personalities, or in the cinematic language itself. While there are no americanized one-liners or billboard-sized refernces to modern western tropes, there is some humour to be found within the horror which happens to most of these characters in this moderately desolate landscape.Speaking of a non-americanized film, one must go into this picture knowing full well this is a different kind of movie, one where the pace isn't with the all-too-overused hollywoodesque beats. While never fully throttled action-paced (save perhaps for the final showdown), it never drags on, and the editing alongside the score chosen for the film play to the rhythm and advancement of the story. In essence, it may feel ""slow"" for some audiences, but it is still more gripping than most blockbusters.This is a highly engaging film, one which showcases the film-makers' love of the craft and the attention they brought to every frame of the film. It may not be in everyone's ""watch list"" but should be viewed nonetheless, at the very least as a refreshing ""foreign"" film, one which deserves much praise.SPOILER: in revenge films, there will be murder scènes, and this one delivers a couple of rather uncomfortable ones indeed; not in the over-the-top excess we have come to getbored with in western civilizations, but more realistic and grueling ones requiring effort. If such scènes are disturbing for you, then maybe think twice before watching this film. While nothing ""too"" graphic nor gore considering the wave of ultra-violence in american films, the sheer brutality of human versus human as depicted in this film is rather impressive and memorable."
" ""Fargo"" meets ""Death wish""
",2019-04-08 00:00:00,9,"An Honorable Citizen takes action against his son's death who has been mistakenly killed by local drug lords.This ignites a war between two gangs unknowingly to the bereaved father.
Recently ""Cold Pursuit' has released starring Liam Neeson,it is the Holly remake of the former made by the same director.
Critics loved the original one and termed it as ""Like Death Wish set in Fargo but funnier and bloodier"".The visual storytelling is sure to fall for in this flick.The snowy fields vividly brings out perfect imagery for the film.The dark tone of comedy set in the film is hard to miss.The typical human instincts is shown ,the action a person takes up thinking he is right,decisions borne out on anger,decisions a person takes driven by emotion.The film starts as a typical revenge thriller but as it dives deeper,we witness something unprecedented..no plot twists but sure to make u surprised.The murders one by one is shown rather in a
comic way slightly resembling Tarantino style of violence.Bruno Ganz(who we lost recently)has given a clinical performance as 'papa'..a gangstar.Alexander Skarsgard ,the lead has taken the film on his shoulders whenever he is in ,gives a robust performance ,vulnerable and fierce ,remorseless all at the same time.Pal Hagen gives the best of the lot,a gang star having a troubled marital life ,a father and a cold blooded gang star . The performance blew me away,his satanic smiles will resonate in my memory long way down.Hans Moland delivers a brilliant film from his kitty ......"
" Near perfect Nordic revenge thriller
",2019-03-26 00:00:00,8,"The use of a protagonist whom drives a huge range of snow-ploughs in some of the most snow affected rural lands I've ever seen is what definitely makes this movie memorable. And snow makes the blood redder. I love the Director for this vision. The tale kicks off swiftly, the initial murder being brilliantly choreographed. The savage immediate follow up is also brilliant and we understand the title. The soundscape here is also working a treat, very modern, minimal, appropriate, and restrained. I've knocked it a couple of stars for the slightly over-done middle and tail sections, where over complications and reliance on character talk as filler should have been devoted, I think anyway, to more introspect character development, and more cinematography. More noir less black comedy. The lead baddie almost falls over in this regard, he's overly precocious. OK, sure, that's just my opinion. Basically Kraftidioten has a much more European outlook than (say) a dark American revenge piece, and I'll immediately concede that that's probably more modern and much more to people's taste. Consequently, I really can't wait to see the Liam Neeson version."
" Not your average revenge flick...
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,9,"Jaw-dropping vistas, superb cinematography, and impeccable sound design are just the beginning for this revenge tale that is a mesmerizing juxtaposition between gritty action and dark humor. I love revenge tales of all kinds, but my favorites are those which add a touch of humanity to the characters, where everyone involved is a shade of gray rather than a black or white cliche. In Order of Disappearance (by its English name) rips you mercilessly into a gorgeous and gritty world with believable characters and does not relent until the credits hit after an ongoing body count.The only thing I wish it had was a little bit more set-up to the relationship between the son and Nils. One can assume they had a good relationship since they are father and son, but they are never even on screen together (alive, that is). Still, it could just as easily be said that this is unnecessary to get to the main story, which is already sizeable. Kudos must be given to this movie's ability to get me to sympathize even with the villains. I found the Count to be unique (a brutal vegan cocaine dealer? What an awesome concept), captivating, and surprisingly charming in an anti-hero sort of way, and I've added the actor (Pål Sverre Hagen) to my ""keep an eye out for"" list. The interpersonal relationships with his henchmen added humanity and in-group turmoil in a way most vengeance flicks do not show. And as always, Bruno Ganz does a phenomenal job. His character is yet another that I felt for despite him being the criminal that he was.Absolutely beautiful film. I didn't find it to be *as* violent as I expected based off the other reviews, though I would have welcomed it. Though this movie has some dark humor, it is used sparingly and does not make the film at all goofy. When violence and gore is shown on screen, it is gritty and realistic rather than splashy and played for flair. I love even the roughest revenge films, but this one went above and beyond and pleasantly surprised me. Give this a watch; you likely won't be disappointed."
" Violently driven black humor. Although it is definitely not a straight comedy, I cant help but chuckle, about the incredible unique ways gangsters get chopped up
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,8,"Violently driven black HUMOR, but then a very sobering Scandinavian version of it. In 2019 an American remake was made of this story with Liam Neeson in it, called ""Cold Pursuit"", which totally flopped compared to this great original.This dark, yet funny story is about a Norwegian father whose son gets killed by drug dealers. The father swears revenge and the title ""In order of disappearance"" can be taken literally, because the father will chop the heads of these drugdealers, one by one...Although it is definitely not a straight comedy, but a dark and violent killing spree, this movie still has got a continuous black humour undertone, which makes it very enjoyable and sometimes even hilarious to watch. Most of the gangsters in this movie are total d*uchebags and rather full of themselves and they get ridiculed in a very tongue in cheek way, which is quite funny to watch. For example; gangsters who are seriously discussing which breakfast cereal is healthier for their kids, that sort of stuff. And then they get chopped up by a snowmachine. This movie consists of continuous hilarious (dry) dialogues and bizarre plot turns, which are incredibly original and fun to watch...Despite the ridiculing of the gangsters and the violently driven black humor, the story and the acting are still to be taken seriously, with a stellar performance by Scandanavian actor Skarsgard, maybe best known as the bad guy in one of the Mission Impossible series, although the man has made many other great pictures in his career. I really would recommend this movie to any gangster flick fan, who likes to experience a fresh new take on this violent dark comedy genre. It is a hidden gem for you to be discovered, IF you like very DRY and dark Scandinavian humour."
" From Norway, With Revenge!!!
",2019-02-04 00:00:00,9,"Revenge respects nobody in this life. Even a good, solid, upstanding citizen may find a reason to take the law into his hands if he is driven far enough. This is the case in Norwegian director Hans Petter Moland's gripping crime thriller ""In Order of Disappearance,"" a brutal, above-avenge, revenge melodrama bristling with lots of violence. Gloomy, snow-swept, but amusing in an ironic way, the film won't let you take your eyes of its characters. Indeed, crime doesn't pay in this 116-minute epic crime thriller. Stellan Skarsgård stars as Nils Dickman, an ordinary, everyday sort of blue-collar guy who drives a huge snowplow and keeps the roads clear around his hometown in Tyos. Imagine Nils' horror when the authorities inform him that his son has died from a heroin overdose. While his wife Gudrun (Hildegun Riise of ""House of Fools"") is prepared to believe that their grown-up son Ingvar Dickman (Aron Eskeland) trafficked in drugs, Nils steadfastly refuses to accept that he was a junkie. Eventually, Nils proves it to himself that Ingvar wasn't hooked on heroin. By that time, Nils has taken matters into his own hands. He tracks down three of the Count's henchmen, kills them, and then hires a treacherous assassin, nicknamed 'the Chinaman,' (David Sakurai) for $90-thousand. Incredibly, the dastard sells Nils out and makes a better deal for himself with the villain, the Count (Pal Sverre Hagen of ""Kon-Tiki""), who is about as sordid an adversary as you can imagine. Tall, slender, immaculately dressed, the Count is a contemptuous fellow who wears his hair improbably in a ponytail. Divorced, he spends every other week with his son according to the divorce decree, and he loathes his ex-wife, Marit (Birgitte Hjort Sørensen of ""Pitch Perfect 2"") with a passion. Eventually, after he has hired the Chinaman, Nils consults his older brother, Egil Dickman (Peter Andersson of ""Underworld: Blood Wars""), for advice. Mind you, Egil is nothing like Nils. Against his Egil's advice, Nils paid 'the Chinaman' the entire $90-thousand to kill the Count. Before long, the Count figures it out for himself that Egil is at the bottom of his troubles, so they kill Egil. Of course, the Count didn't know about Egil's younger brother. Treachery within the ranks sabotages the Count as he finds himself not only looking for Nils, but he also has to contend with Serbs. In effect, Nils finds himself caught in a cross-fire as he kidnaps the Count's son, Rune (Jack Sødahl Moland), while Serbian crime lord Papa (Bruno Ganz of ""Nosferatu"") wants the boy because the Count killed his son. Every time anybody dies, Moland inserts a title card with a cross and the deceased person's name. After almost two hours, this title card gimmick takes on a darkly comic turn. Of course, Stellan Skarsgård gives an impeccable performance, and Pal Sverre Hagen is menacing in a weird way. Interestingly enough, the use of the snow plow is what differentiates our hero from everybody else. ""In Order of Disappearance"" qualifies as an invigorating revenge tale."
" Whited-Out
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,7,"'Plowed-under' might be a better title with black humor to some extent ruled only by the scenery of jetting snow and chicken-wired bodies with ex-whatever spiting on your grave of course topped-off by the simple villain and his 'Stockholm Syndrome' son whose mother seems to be one of the smarter members in this frozen mafia shoot-out proving the point three main woman in the film, made the best choice..."

" A nordic thriller

" Master Class In Film Making.
",2018-09-13 00:00:00,8,"Sigh. Why couldn't I have been the writer or director of this film? Hell, I would even settle to be best boy, gaffer, caterer, shoe shine specialist or whatever. It's finally refreshing to see a movie that has all the T's crossed and the I's dotted. It stars Stellan Skarsgard and Bruno Ganz, for Heaven's sake. How bad could it be?I didn't come into the film expecting much other than it was yet another entry in Norwegian cold landscape crime noir category. The scenery alone was worth the price of admission since it's quite the chore to film snowy landscapes. Here, the snow-capped mountains looked a postcard come to life. The direction was taut and there were no wasted scenes. I couldn't help but noticing there was a bit of a Tarantino-esque touch to a few parts of the movie, but I'm not complaining. This film has a lot of layers to it and it is easy to follow. The producers should be proud of themselves."
" Like the snow, it overstayed its welcome
",2018-03-20 00:00:00,5,"A great performance -- believable and restrained -- by Stellan Skarsgard, but after an hour the whole film started to drag. If they'd toned down some of the farcical humour and cut 30 to 40 minutes, it would have packed much more of an emotional punch."
" Once Upon a Time in the North
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,5,"We might be used to the (usually American) revenge movie, and Scandinavian noir, as two different genes. But 'In the Order of Disappearance"" combines the two, as a snowplough driver seeks to punish those responsible for the death of his son, and incidentally starts a gang war as he does so. The tone of the film is peculiar, in places it's solemn, in others it feels more like a comedy, and I found it hard to care about any of its protagonists, even the hero (whose behaviour is, by any rational standards, a massive over-reaction, in spite of the insult that has been done to him). It's certainly an unusual film, but that does not mean it's a great one."
" Quirky black comedy
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,6,"IN ORDER OF DISAPPEARANCE is less a crime thriller and more a quirky comedy in the blackest of moulds. This Norwegian film sees the reliably good Stellan Skarsgard shining in the lead role of a grieving father investigating the murder of his son at the hands of a drugs gang. He begins to take a violent revenge, a revenge which eventually leads to a war between rival criminal organisations in the style of YOJIMBO. This is a chilly outing which is as much about the frost-bitten, snowbound landscapes of northern Norway as it is the cruel monotonous nature of killing. It's well made for sure, with an eye for detail, but it lacks a single speck of warmth to give the story heart. A strong supporting cast features roles for Bruno Ganz and a blink-and-you'll-miss-him Kristofer Hivju."
" Oh dear!
",2018-02-21 00:00:00,1,"A ""black comedy"" that is neither black nor comedic. I had such high expectations and kept hoping that it would get better but sadly, it didn't. An hour and 56 minutes I won't get back."
" A revenge film
",2017-09-13 00:00:00,7,"Stellan Skarsgård stars in ""In Order of Disappearance,"" a Norwegian film from 2014.In the middle of this, I started thinking of the John Carpenter film ""Christine"" about that evil car. This was a bit like Christine the Snowblower.Nils (Skarsgard) is a quiet man who plows snow - and does he ever, in this massive machine - in the winter mountains of Norway. He is highly thought of and recently won a Citizen of the Year Award. When his son is murdered for something he did not do, Nils sets out to get revenge. The situation becomes complicated as Albanian monsters are also after the man responsible for the death - a health-nut drug dealer called ""The Count"" who has a young son - and both Nils and the Albanians have the same idea of how to get to him. Plus, due to mistaken identity, tragedy strikes for Nils yet again.Violent and bloody film with touches of Tarantino and the Cohn Brothers' Fargo's dark humor. Skarsgard is wonderful as always. And the scenery - well, there is an awful lot of snow but it's quite beautiful.I liked it, and I look forward to ""A Somewhat Gentle Man"" from this director. By the way, the original title in Norwegian means Power Idiots. I suppose you could say that."
" Shootout in the snow at the Norskie Corral is a Rib-tickling Norwegian crime thriller
",2017-08-21 00:00:00,10,"Shootout at the Norskie Corral is the grand Finale of Snowplow Opera ""in Order of Disappearance"". Old Bruno Ganz is still full of P. and V. and Stellan Skarsgard is literally awesome.""In Order of Disappearance"" (Kraftidioten, or ""Power freaks"" in German) directed by Hans Peter Moland is the surprise of the week at Berlin 2014. Stellan Skarsgård is a snowplow driver who will stop at nothing to reap revenge on his son's drug lord killers in this wildly rib-tickling Norwegian crime thriller. In a followup to his sympathetic listener in Nymphomaniac senior Swede thespian Skarsgård is suddenly a powerful star presence at age 61. Elderly Swiss actor Bruno Ganz, now 71, also amuses as an unlikely gun-toting Serbian Mafia godfather. The film title is a take-off on the familiar cast credit introduction: ""in order of appearance"". In this film the cast members are not named at the beginning, but as each one is knocked off in creatively brutal gangland fashion the name appears ~ in order of disappearance! ~ on a black screen as a death notice, with a small cross -- in one case, a Star of David as one of the victims happens to be Jewish (Horowitz). The body count is enough to fill the entire screen at the end -- nearly everybody who appears gets killed and disappears.Not only is this a rip-roaring actioner but also a heady satire of right wing politics, left wing politics, especially the socialist welfare state, and the very conventions of the Godfather genre. For example, the main villain is a tall handsome clean cut leading man type who is a practicing vegan and has all his henchman drinking bio fruit juices. ""Graf"", as he us called, is a totally callous killer but weeps tenderly when his his own son is kidnapped. This picture has it all, fast action, thrills and spills in a breathtaking setting of arctic snowscapes, raw and subtle humor, terrific deadpan acting, high concept everything and was applauded wildly for something like ten minutes at the end. In my book this should be the Golden Bear hands down with Stellan Skarsgård a shoo in for best festival actor with two outstanding performances back to back -- this and Nymphomaniac. However Berlin is not noted for awarding crowd pleasers, no matter how well made. Morose depressers with unknown actors destined for quick oblivion have a much better chance for prizes here -- however, as a certain Dirty Harry might say, ""In Order of Disappearance"" made my day and justified suffering through two other soporifics on Berlin festival day number 6."
" Revenge
",2017-06-16 00:00:00,6,"(Flash Review)A local snowplow driver's son ends up dead because of a loose connection to a friend entangled with a drug gang. Furious by the lack of care and effort the police are giving to his son's case, he takes matters into his own hands. A hinted at backstory about the snowplow driver gives you the impression, he is up for this task. The movie visibly counts and takes note of each person killed as two drug gangs also get pitted upon each other. This is a very entertaining guys movie as the rest of the story is rather thin. Other reviewers said this was similar to Tarantino's films with the clever dialog. It was amusing but didn't develop the characters and were not close to as memorable as his scripts. While the cinematography was very good, this is no more than a shallow shoot 'em up, revenge-fill bloodbath."
" I avoided this film thinking it would be scary Scandinavian noir, but
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,8,"Finally watched it last night. Instead, I got a film that quickly grew on me as the body count mounted (hence the Englsh title). An earlier reviewer said it was like Fargo, but I would add a touch of an absurd Kill Bill body count. At the end of the film I was laughing out loud. A great dark comedy."
" An ordinary middle-aged man driven to extreme violence...very extreme violence.
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,8,"""In Order of Disappearance"" is NOT a film for everyone. In some ways, I'd categorize it as 'Murder Porn'...a movie with many, many vivid and brutal killings...like a Tarantino or Guy Ritchie movie. And, like one of these incredibly carnage-filled movies, it's also exceptionally well made. But being well made does not mean it's for everyone....it is a really nasty story of revenge.When the film begins, two guys are abducted and one is murdered. The other escapes and eventually makes it to see Nils Dickman--the father of the dead man. It seems that the guy who got away was involved with drug dealers but Dickman's son was completely innocent. Well, Nils isn't about to let go and has decided he must have justice--even though he's just one man against a gang of vicious drug dealers. It's funny, as Nils was just awarded a Man of the Year award...and now he's about to become a vicious killing machine. Nils only has one lead and soon abducts this lead. He savagely beats and then murders the gang member after he learns the next one in the chain of command and does the same once again. After Nils kills his third gang member, the gangs take notice...and think it's a rival Serbian gang behind all this. Soon, it's all out war...and bodies are piling up faster than the audience can keep track of them. This film is exquisitely directed and realistic to boot. But it's also blood-filled and violent...and I am talking about very realistic and hideous killings. I was actually surprised, as I just assumed Americans and Brits were the only ones making these sort of films! Well made...but please, please, please...DON'T let your kids, mother or Father O'Reilly catch you watching this film!"
" No very professional behavior from snow mob...
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,8,"Is that appropriate for the body to be bouncing like that? Failed empathy via police, just like the frigid weather.I've never seen a snow storm funeral.Don't f with a parent whose lost a child. Especially when they are old.Tremendous job leaving no loose ends.Excellent parenting numb-nuts. Even better foresight. Your son won't at all repeat those words over your corpse in 10 years.Super creepy hands room. That took someone a long time to setup for a few seconds of screen time.It's like watching Liam Neeson's dad.F-n Froot Loops!!! Creepy chairs. At least his design sense is consistent.Awesome hair. Red beard.I don't know which is funnier... his car singing or the other guy's look.What a nice crime boss to bring coffee and donuts.I agree. What is with the names.How's the modern mob feel about this? Don't interrupt the boss when he's playing Pokémon Go! Nice posture.The sign says MOB :) I like the segues.Raising another body.Tough times at the HQ of the carrot juice gang.I'm betting it's a good thing the snow blades are red.Good Geir.Sort old man.Classy to the end.Eddie the Eagle :)"
" A pleasant surprise
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,8,"You'll remember Stellan Skarsgard from Good Will Hunting. He's done plenty of work since then, but this role in particular is a standout in my opinion. He played his part so low key. No ego. So much so that he comes off as a different person than the actor in Good Will Hunting. The entire cast did a fine job. This movie was fun for me, because I had never really thought about Norway being a place where rival mobsters (and their gangs) would go at it. Such a gorgeous country. Lots of snow. Winter snow, not spring snow. It was cold when this was filmed. Creative, different, decent soundtrack, plenty of comic relief in this otherwise violent movie."
" Unbelievably Dumb Crime Stuff
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,4,"As much as I like Stellan Skarsgård he must have really needed a payday to agree to make this piece of junk.The white Norwegian background gives sharp contrast to the glitzy setting and props but the story is tired crime/gangster manure with the usual trimmings. About a quarter-way through the film the viewer is given strong suggestion regarding the direction the film may take, though I found myself saying, ""Wait, there HAS to be more to it than this!"" There is not. About the only highlight is Jan Gunnar Røise's performance and I look forward to seeing him act is a more ambitious project. The other ""highlight"" comes almost halfway through the film in the form of the WORST screen punch I have ever seen thrown, in this case thrown by Stellan who has fully extended and is drawing back his arm before his ""victim"" is anywhere near him. Don't bother with this movie."
