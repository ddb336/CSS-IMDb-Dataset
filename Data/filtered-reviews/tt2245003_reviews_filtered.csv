" Too Predictable
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,5,"""Miss You Already is just another friendship and disease movie like all millions of movie out there that have a same themed, nothing special, all the perfomance is just ordinary, and the big problem in this movie is too predictable, i mean even you just read the synopsis i think you will already know what's gonna happen, so no surprise at all, and i think 2 hours it just too long for this, just enjoyable ? i don't think so, i don't find any enjoyable part in this movie, overall Miss You Already is just too predictable and too long"""
" Hard to watch because of my own breast cancer but I did it!
",2020-08-21 00:00:00,8,"I saw this on the tv schedule last week and decided I couldn't watch it based on the material but then I changed my mind. PVRed it and just finished it. The movie is way better than I anticipate altho' I was REALLY hoping Toni Collette's character wouldn't die of breast cancer, because a LARGE % of breast cancer patients do survive - and thrive. I went through b/c treatment last year and I could totally relate to parts of it - the double mastectomy and the self conscious feelings afterwards, etc. The subject was handled very well I thought, and the acting was very good from all the actors. But I felt very sad at the end and I so wished she had survived. It also reminded me of Beaches a lot.It was bittersweet, funny in parts, sad, but never really got maudlin and depressing and manipulative. So well done to all involved!Lastly, that hospice was UNREAL! Just gorgeous. Like a luxury hotel suite. Having seen my sister die in a hospice in NE England I can tell you her room was nothing like that!"
" Sad film
",2020-08-04 00:00:00,8,I really liked this filme. It's sad but it's beautiful too.
" A film about friendship, family and life
",2020-07-12 00:00:00,7,"This is a story following two best friends, Milly (Toni Collette) and Jess (Drew Barrymore), inseparable since they were young girls. Their friendship is put to the test when Milly falls ill and her world slowly starts to fall apart deeply affecting everybody around her, especially Jess.The story is sad but the comedic and familiar cut is a pleasant touch that involves the audience.
Toni Collette, as always, elevates everything she is in. Drew Barrymore is stellar as well, delivering a genuine performance. Paddy Considine and Dominic Cooper are great in the role of male supporting characters, above all they appear to deeply love their women companions.
It is ultimately a film about friendship, family, life and death. A honest and powerful story."
" Drew Barrymore ROCKS!!
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,7,"I immersed myself in this honest and deep powerful story of 2 best friends Jess and Milly, played by Drew Barrymore and Toni Colette, as they go through life inseparable best friends since they were girls. There's never been a time they didn't share anything, such as clothes and boyfriends, but their friendship is tested the day Milly is hit with life-altering news. I really enjoyed Barrymores character as the kind and loving Jess, but Jess's husband Kit is such a clod as everything he says makes you want to strangle him and say ""SHUT YOUR MOUTH!"" and also the fact that he has this English accent, you can also like him, too. I think Jacqueline Bisset's character is a great supporting actress, although there were definitely flaws on every character. I like Drew's character as she is so kind to her friend Milly and loves her as a real friend should. I cried when I heard of Milly's news because it hits true to home, since both my parents went through the devastation of cancer! The end wasn't too bad, except for the sentimentality, 'Miss You Already' really lives up to its name. I've liked every movie Drew Barrymore has been in so far and I've loved them all. She's such a real person who totally immersed themselves in every part. I'll give this movie a 7 because of her."
" Beautiful film
",2020-02-28 00:00:00,7,"Toni Collette is absolutely wonderful and the story is quite good. I cried my way through it, both the ups and the downs."
" Not a film , Tv series it is
",2019-12-07 00:00:00,3,Too long for an ordinary story. It could be a great tv series and it is too long to watch and too dramatic
" Neither comedy nor romance, pure drama
",2019-10-31 00:00:00,8,"I wonder why it was classified as comedy and romance, it is a pure drama that worths watching. Acting was perfect, tears are inevitable, friendship and cancer.Prepare your tissue box and watch"
" Drew and Toni have great chemistry as best friends forever
",2019-10-17 00:00:00,8,"This was quite good, along the lines of Beaches but with more comedy like Terms of Endearment except with a Hugh Grant sarcastic dry British humour. Its a comedy drama with Drew Barrymore as Jess and Toni Collette is Milly, a duo who become best friends as grade-schoolers and remain best friends well into their late thirties. When Milly is diagnosed with cancer their friendship is tested.Most of the movie is done in a montage; them as kids, teens, YA, married, babies, birthdays etc. Toni Collette is awesome, her British accent a bit lame at times, her husband gorgeous. Drews character a bit dull, she is good though and her and Toni have great chemistry together. Overall the movie is likable and engaging."
" Loved It
",2019-08-29 00:00:00,10,"This film sent me through an array of emotions; I laughed, I cried; all the actresses and actors played their parts brilliantly"
" Not another cancer movie?
",2019-08-29 00:00:00,2,"This is actually my first imdb review, although I regularly read others after watching movies that I find quite interesting. This time I felt so inspired to even write one. As a cancer survivor myself, I saw couple of them since the diagnosis with a particular attention. What really ticks me off is what I call ""the systematic destruction of the patient with cancer diagnosis"". Yes, firstly on social and psychological level, where film like this do a great job, and later with the whole medical labyrinth, which I also find quite unreliable to the path towards the healing, but that's another story. What Miss you already and the similar do is representing the diagnosis as a death sentence and promoting this idea among the public. 
I do like Drew a lot, and I watch with a pleasure films with Toni Colette. I saw ""Muriel's wedding"" just because of her, but this time she didn't convince me. Maybe the fact that I didn't like the character in general also had that influence. It's true that if you are cancer patient you need to be taken care of a little bit more than usual, but she just abused the whole attention. Yes, she did some things she wouldn't done otherwise, like going to the Heights, but I'm not sure about the cheating. I used to have colostomy and I know very well the desire to feel accepted in your own body, but I prefer rather different model of behavior. Something different, more down-to-earth character who would use the best the short time she has ahead, would be a model how to deal in emotionally mature manner with this situation. Reinforcing the idea of a death sentence, and spoiled and emotionally unstable woman after the diagnosis left me with a just bad feeling after watching the film, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone having to deal with it in the real life."
" Maybe I missed the point.....
",2019-07-02 00:00:00,2,"A film that thinks it's ticking all the boxes but it's trying too hard, it's trying to make people cry without making you like the characters, I love a film with heart but this is rank average and lacking in genuine heart and just annoyed me to a certain extent.I lost my wife to cancer when she was 28 and I didn't even get close to a tear watching this, if that doesn't tell you the film misses the point then maybe nothing will.Maybe it's harsh but it comes across as written by someone who is trying to imagine losing their wife or best friend to cancer, self indulgent and cliche, that's not what a cancer diagnosis is. I cry at so many films and this didn't touch the sides emotionally. Casting I thought was poor for the roles.I've watched lots of films about cancer before and after my wife died and this is the first one that actually annoyed me, lazy filmmaking.Don't think I've ever written such a negative review but just felt the need to watching it."
" Not Good enough
",2019-05-08 00:00:00,4,"The problem with this film is that it is not original. That and the way the characters were portraiyed was off. They were just too perfect, too predictable to the point they got annoying. The camera shots were a mess as well."
" Splendid piece of work by all cast!
",2018-11-06 00:00:00,10,"Especially, both Drew Barrymore and Toni Collete brings out all the natural affection into the film. They both show us the great Importance of having a best friend (That no one other can replace)* in our life since the beginning till the last.... The may be dedicated to all bffs around!"
" A sad, yet funny film
",2018-10-12 00:00:00,8,"""Miss You Already"" follows rebellious Milly (Toni Collette) and her struggle with the cancer, supported by best bud Jess (Drew Barrymore). And special mention goes to Milly's mum, Miranda, a high class woman who barely holding it together (as a mother would) - this role was so superbly played by divine Jacqueline Bisset. This is without a doubt a female driven story but men do play a pretty significant part. The film does a great job of depicting and showing how having a disease like breast cancer can change your life as well as those around you. This movie does however fall into a trap of lifetime clich√©s and the middle section of the film gently touches boredom why it feels like it could have lost 15 minutes or so. ""Miss You Already"" is not a perfect movie, but few movies are. It handles a hard subject in a noble way with skill. This makes it able to compensate for some of its shortcomings. 8-/10"
" Solid 8 Star Movie! Excellent tear-jerker!
",2018-05-25 00:00:00,8,"I'm glad I watched this on Hulu before it expired. It was well worth the time to watch! I cried my heart out though, so be aware if you are a 'softy' or a 'sucker for a heart-warming film', then watch this for sure. I believe you will enjoy it. It's different for Drew Barrymore, but she does very well in this. Check this movie out if you get a chance. I don't believe you'll be disappointed."
" Soul Nourishig Tear Jerker
",2018-05-12 00:00:00,9,"The low ratings are surprising. This was beautiful film in every way. It's sad but also warm and even funny at times. If you are in the mood for a soul nourishing tear jerker, this film will deliver."
" Could've been much better
",2018-04-08 00:00:00,5,"Not far into this movie I said to myself, ""this style reminds me of Twilight."" Sure enough, when the end credits rolled up I saw it was directed by Catherine Hardwick. I think this could've been a much better film in the hands of someone else. I wasn't a fan of the cinematography at all. Even though Collette and Barrymore give great performances the movie drags. Tyson Ritter totally took me out of the story. I mean he even has his AAR tattoo practically screaming in your face. I thought it was a poor choice.
I appreciate the film's bleak look at cancer and how it affects the person diagnosed as well as everyone around them. It was emotional and as someone who has experienced loss and grief, quite triggering. I felt rather depressed (I mean, it's about cancer) and I kind of wish I'd known beforehand what it was about. This is a movie I would advise others to skip, but to each their own."
" Predictable
",2018-04-02 00:00:00,6,"A bit too predictable, but the filmography made up for some of the expected lines. 
Good discussion of cancer for kids. 
I didn't find it as emotional as many other reviewers. 
It missed some real discussion about death and spirituality."
" Toni Collette shines
",2018-02-02 00:00:00,10,"Beautiful, funny and sad. Unlike some reviewers I cannot be stingy with my stars.
Great casting of characters with real flaws. I have lost several friends to the bastard that is cancer and appreciated this movies humour and sensitivity."
" A trashy, even more predictable, version of Beaches
",2017-05-26 00:00:00,7,"Aside from the obvious chemistry between Toni Collette and Drew Barrymore, there are so many things wrong with this movie. I hung in there until the end--the incredibly predictable end--if only to confirm my predictions.Apparently, according to this film, being diagnosed with breast cancer is a sudden ticket to be a complete narcissist. For a mother who promised her kids she would always be there for them, she sure has a short memory, even when things were within her control.What a waste."
" I laughed, I cried; it was better than Cats!
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,8,"One of the quotes touting this movie said Beaches for 2015. While yes, I do mostly agree; I don't recall many male characters in Beaches. Toni Collette and Drew Barrymore are fantastic as best friends that have been there together through everything thick and thin. While Toni Collette's character takes a dark turn the portrayal of friendship and the sadness of preparing and dealing with the death of a loved one is something we all eventually must face. Tissue Alert! Good flick when you need to shed a tear."
" film should come with a free box of tissues
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,10,"My housemates and i found this film on a very hungover Sunday afternoon on a streaming service, and having seen Barrymore in Santa Clarita Diet (which is incredible) i said we should watch Miss You Already. Two hours later you have 3 fully grown women sobbing into handfuls of loo roll. The film deals with bereavement so beautifully, and as someone who has lost close family members, it is refreshing to watch a film which doesn't sugar coat illness and (spoiler alert) death. The screenplay is faultless, had us laughing as well as ugly-crying, whist also provoking poignant and meaningful thought about death, friendship and suffering. The characters were beautifully constructed, and by the end of the film you will be emotionally attached to each and every one. This is not, by any means a 'chick-flick' in my opinion, as it defies the standard rules of the boy-meets-girl story line, to create a much more profound and meaningful film which anyone would enjoy despite their normal preferences, and stays with you long after the film has ended."
