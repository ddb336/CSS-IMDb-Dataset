" Underrated Movie...
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,10,"Fantastic story... so many great actors... great soundtrack. The music setting each scene keeps you glued to your seat and holding on for the ride!!I love this movie but it gets forgotten about with all the newer marvel films. Just relax, strap in and enjoy the story of Hydra finally exposing their poisonous head! 10/10."
" Entertaining and Action-packed
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,9,"Oh man. I am so fired. Wow this movie was awesome. It was full of action scenes. The fighting, shooting, and car chasing scenes were well-handled, entertaining, and intense. The Winter Soldier looked so cool and threatening. I loved the scene where he sat in the dark, as well as the first couple scenes where he first appeared. He gave such ominous presence. The story became more complex and thrilling than the First Avenger. It was surprisingly emotional toward the end as Cap interacted more with Winter Soldier. Overall, the movie was incredibly entertaining and action packed. Had a great time. 9/10."
" The best MCU movie!
",2021-03-25 00:00:00,10,"This is just the best of the MCU, the fights are great, the plot, everything, this movie keeps me on the edge of my seat."
" Not the best MCU movie but probably my favorite to watch
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,9,I love the MCU and think some MCU films are superior to TWS but this is the most likely MCU movie I'll watch just to disconnect. The highway knife fight is pure choreographic gold. Buckys progress in the MCU is great and I'm looking forward to Falcon and TWS but I also think that he was a fantastic villain and could've remained so.
" Possibly the best Marvel movie, ever
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,10,"That scene where Fury was ambushed is one I've watched umpteen times and there's something about the ensemble cast that works better here than the Avengers. Overall, a delightful masterpiece that's been hard to top. IMO, of course."
" One of the best in the MCU
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,10,"The film is a spy thriller mixed with some aspects of ""superheroness"" and I think that's what makes this film one of the most respected and loved in the entire MCU. It puts CGI on the side and the Russo Brothers make it a hard hitting, action packed, spectacle. The addition of Black Widow and the relationship and chemistry between her and Steve Rogers is the cherry on top of the cake for me.
It introduces Sam Wilson as Falcon who, even though he doesn't have any powers himself and doesn't fight aswell as both Black Widow and Captain America, doesn't feel out of place with just his wings! The winter soldier is a fantastic villain too!"
" my opinion
",2021-03-18 00:00:00,9,Very nice and the new characters are excellent .. excited about the rest of the series
" Awesome but...
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,7,"This movie is very very good, but only near 30 minutes of movie. The beggining is very boring and I only watched this movie now, in 2021, because I quit the movie at the start (not in the cinema obviously)."
" Extraordinary
",2021-03-08 00:00:00,9,"I am not a comic book expert, but there is something I can guarantee: this film deserves our full attention. If ""Captain America: First Avenger"" turned out to be pleasant and full of quality, this film proved to be a worthy continuation. It will not be correct to say that I was surprised: Marvel has provided us with excellent productions, and it is difficult, therefore, to keep expectations low. However, in the end, I was satisfied.The plot goes back to Steve Rogers' past to reveal the existence of a rival to his height: the Winter Soldier, a super soldier, like Captain America, whose origins and past are closely related to Rogers. I don't know if this story is faithful to what is told in the comic books, but I also feel that, for me, it doesn't matter. The plot is developing well, with space for action and the fight scenes are good and seem real.Chris Evans returns to the role of Captain America, and he is skilled, heroic and energetic. Samuel L. Jackson and Robert Redford also do an excellent job, at the level of the best they have done so far in their long careers. Scarlett Johansson and Anthony Mackie seem to have received characters tailored to them, especially Johansson. Sebastian Stan is good, but he didn't get my attention much. Emily VanCamp is good, but her character is not very relevant and is not very interesting.But where this film really excelled was in the quality of production values, and the most technical aspects. Cinematography, for example, is sharp, elegant, with excellent filmmaking and an absolute command of color, movement, and shadows, which make the film visually extraordinary. Add to that the grandeur of the visual effects, the latest generation CGI and, of course, the action and fighting scenes, and the result is overwhelming. The sets and costumes also deserve a note of great praise: I especially liked the sets at the Avengers headquarters, a futuristic and elegant complex that seems to have been taken from an urban planning project in an Asian city. The aircraft also look magnificent and impress. The soundtrack, on the other hand, is quite good, it fits perfectly in the film, but I confess that it was not in my ear and that I did not find it particularly memorable."
" Still the best Disney/McMarvel film
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,8,"Good story, excellent OST, some good action/fight scenes and not full of childish jokes. However, once again, the cinematography is so grey & ugly and the classic Marvel way of 57 cuts/edits for ONE punch/kick in many fight scenes, you don't see or feel anything. Directing sub-par. But still easily the best of a bad bunch from Disney/McMarvel."
" Flawless debut by the Russo brothers
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,10,"This was another amazing entry in the MCU and the Russo brothers were the right choice to do this film because they really know their comic books. It was a great espionage film, the action was top notch, and all the performances get an A+. There is nothing more to say other than if you haven't seen this film, you should add it to your watch list."
" Overrated but not terrible.
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,6,"I hear all these people saying 'Oh BeSt MarVel MoVie!' which is obviously wrong. (Iron Man 2008 and The Avengers 2012 are both far better) and other people saying 'NoT a SuPer HerO mOviE, SpY Movie' because it makes them feel less stupid and childish for liking this boring trash. It's like the people that think they're mad film geniuses because they 'understand the genius' of Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice (Terrible title) directed by Hack Snyder. This movie is average at best, not great, but not amazing.Ps. Anyone that says the MCU is better than the DCEU, or the DCEU is better than the MCU, can shut it. They're both the same, and they can both cower at the might of The Dark Knight Trilogy and Netflix's Daredevil. Shut up"
" probably one of the best movies ever
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,10,The winter soldier is a amazing film everything about it is perfect the characters are interesting get lots pt development have great character arcs and the new characters introduced are very good. The antagonists are some of the best in the mcu and the winter soldier as a character/antagonist is just amazing. The plot is great and interesting. And the best part about this movie is the fight scenes they are unbelievably good the choreography in the fights the cinematography mixed with the music is perfect absolutely perfect. Also this movies is kinda like a horror movie in a way it makes the audience feel dread through fear of the unknown the winter soldier is terrifying he appears randomly and disappears without a trace for most of the movie we don't know what this thing is but it's terrifying and is trying to kill captain America. The movie does a great job of making the protagonist feel hopeless as people are hunting him down and captain America is unable to fit into modern society it's great to see and the winter soldier Is a masterpiece that is definitely worth watching.
" Great Action (7.9)
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,8,"One of the best movies in the marvel series,I thought it wouldn't be a good movie, but it surprised me.
The action scenes, the effects are great, there is a great improvement compared to the previous Captain America movie, I especially liked it in terms of effects."
" Very good, all in all
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,8,"Entertaining!'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' makes for an enjoyable flick. Chris Evans does great work as the lead character, while Scarlett Johansson gives her most fun to watch performance in the MCU up until this point; it would've been great if she had such a role pre-'The Avengers', so she wouldn't have felt so out of place to me in that.Anthony Mackie and Robert Redford are notable in their respective roles, as is Sebastian Stan - even if, to be honest, his character's connection with the lead didn't quite hit as hard as the film attempts - at least for me. I didn't really believe how his character came about and how Barnes acts throughout, Stan does well though. Samuel L. Jackson is also good.Everything else is exactly what you'd expect from a film of this size. Great effects, entertaining action and a satisfying story. Very good, all in all."
" Best Mcu Movie
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,10,"The movie was the best, one of my Favorites, love this movie and I have to say the people that directed This film did a perfect Job directing it and The Cast for this movie was perfect."
" One of Marvel's Best
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,9,"I've seen this movie several times throughout the years and I had just caught the re-run of this film on ABC. Needless to say, this movie still holds up quite well. Hope Marvel can keep up the good work for their upcoming phase."
" Very good
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,8,"Captain America is fine but ""modern"" from what his adventure lived in the midst of war, his adventures right in this new episode of his trajectory, what can really be appreciated are the good moments of action, involved in a well-created story, enjoying each character from the Marvel universe. The action is well prepared but the film shows everything that other titles have shown, but still fills the eyes with explosions, chases and a lot of hand-to-hand combat. The strategy is also a well-valued point in creating a good suspense, around Steve Rogers, Natasha and Nick a gas but for those waiting for the second Avengers adventure.Film reviewed on the 8th to the 9th of January 2021"
" Nice
",2021-01-07 00:00:00,9,Great movie with great story. I like how political it gets because I didn't see marvel movie that is done that
" best captain america movie ever
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,9,I really like this movie it paces well the action is done really well the plot is good everything about this movie is good definitely a top 5 marvel movie for me. One thing i didn't understand is how did bucky/winter soilder survive 70 years like cap was bucky frozen aswell?
" Amazing
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,10,I love the Captain America film series so much. Words can't put into perspective how good these are. Bucky coming back and Steve not knowing what had happened just made an excellent film.
" ""Air conditioning is fully operational""
",2020-12-23 00:00:00,6,"Two hours of non-stop high-budget action, with a couple of witty moments and the story of the mediocre ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" episode. Undoubtedly fun to watch, but without the essential qualities and totally forgettable.6/10"
" Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) Review - 8.7/10
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,9,"Definitely one of the best sequels in the entire MCU. It's everything you would expect and everything you could every ask for in a Captain America sequel. There's nazis, HYDRA, Nick Fury faking his freaking death, and action. Lots of fantastic Marvel action. This isn't just one of those films that are just 95% action, 5% storytelling, one of the things this films does best is balancing story with action. For example, the Winter Soldier and Steve have some of the best fights in the MCU, but whenever Steve finds out who the Winter Soldier is, it becomes not only an amazingly choreographed fight, but also an emotional one. In conclusion, this is the first truly great MCU sequel."
" great film!
",2020-12-11 00:00:00,9,"This movie started off with a very strange scene involving Captain America jumping out of an airplane with no parachute. This movie had a decent cast but each actor essentially played themselves. Robert Redford was very miscast in this mess of a movie. They didn't let the winter soldier have enough screen time and they certainly didn't ask for that.What happened is that the Winter Soldier was never fully explained and he never really spoke. He said a line or two in what sounded like Russian and then a few other lines. I was very disappointed in Samuel L Jackson's lackluster performance as Nick Fury. He was also very irritating when they brought out the character he once played in that movie called Pulp Fiction. Did this movie have a beginning, middle and end? I would not call the END a true ending. Also, I am getting sick and tired of Stan Lee's cameos. The special effects are over the top in this movie to the point of making me sick. The CG effects are all very OBVIOUS. I was not happy with the way just about everything was CG. And what's the deal with Nick Fury in that car chase? He could have done better in that chase but he didn't."
" Snowpiercer.
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,10,"During the break I took between The Avengers (2012-also reviewed) & Captain America: Civil War (2016-also reviewed) from seeing any MCU films,this was the entry I kept hearing about,and was the most intrigued about viewing someday. Catching up with all the MCU films that I've missed on Disney+,I got set to finally encounter the soldier.View on the film:Drawing their first issue of the MCU, co-directors Joe and Anthony Russo team up with cinematographer Trent Opaloch to make a splash by welding the flawless CGI with white-knuckle hand-to-hand combat sequence, placed in narrow locations such as lifts to give a up-close perspective to the ground and pound attacks.Throwing Captain America's shield across the screen, the Russo's cross the pristine shine of the CBM with the glossy anxiety atmosphere of a Thriller, thanks to ultra-stylised arc shots bleeding The Winter Soldier across the panels of the screen,which sets off rapid whip-pans towards Captain America having to outwit his own side.Mentioned by the two main leads afterwards that they were allowed to improvise some of their dialogue, the screenplay by MCU regulars Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely frees up the film from the back issue weight which had caused Iron Man 2 (2010-also reviewed) to be a challenging production, to instead thrillingly focus on Steve Rogers finding his wholesome ideals of the Govt, to become increasingly tainted.Departing from the fantastical baddies of the past MCU titles for something more grounded in Project MKUltra and NSA programs, the writers thrillingly place Rogers and Black Widow (a wonderful Scarlett Johansson, who combines Widow's deadly action moves with a playful quick- witted edge) in a system seeping with paranoid corruption,where the reverberation of the Hydra terrorist organisation of the 1940's remain in motion.After bringing him in on the great Captain America: The First Avenger (2011-also reviewed) Chris Evans gives a terrific turn as Rogers,thanks to planting a seed of doubt in Rogers life-long belief of who is good and evil,as Captain America comes in from the cold to take on The Winter Soldier."
" Cheesy action flick.
",2020-11-23 00:00:00,6,"This film has awesome action scenes, but the terrible acting and unnatural cheesy dialogues makes this just an alright film."
" one of the best in the whole mcu universe
",2020-11-16 00:00:00,9,"One of the best in the whole MCU universe
very good drama and story beside the MCU fantasy and action"
" Definietly one of the best MCU movies
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,9,"Oh man, was it good to get back to a great movie again after Thor: The Dark World. This movie, unlike that one, is well constructed, written, acted and directed. There is so much to love about the movie it's hard to name it all. The plot is well thought out and realized, complete with great twists and turns to keep you on your toes. I love the spy thriller astethic the movie presents, and it complements the more straight forward action very well. It also presents its themes of trust and morality in a solid and thoughtful way. The pacing is solid, the plot advances in a very natural way, and the movie sets up its important plot points ahead of time to make the movie more enjoyable on rewatches. The movie also does a great job with its characters. Steve, Natasha and Nick are all great characters with their own struggles, while also being very likeable, and they also have excellent chemistry. I love that Steve and Nat's relationsship isn't romantic, as that wouldn't work at all with these characters. I also really like Sam, he's sympathetic and a nice addition. The Winter Soldier is a great villain as well, which mostly comes from the fact that he is just a human, not some evil monster like so many other Marvel villains. I love watching his struggles with indentifying his past and resisting the changes made to his brain, as well as his relationsship with the hero. All this is of course helped by some solid performances from almost everyone involved. The direction is solid as well, with the perfect mix of wide shots and close-ups. The fight choreography is great, one can really feel the weight each fight carries. My only slight issue with the film is the fact that the heroes seem to be saved by plotholes a little too often, for example by a bad guy waiting to killing a good guy just long enough for something to appear to save them. It feels a little stupid, but it's not a big deal and it's pretty easy to ignore if you feel like it. Overall, this movie is extremely good. It does almost everything right, its flaws are small and inconsequental, and it's just a really entertaining movie. I recommend it to anyone who likes superhero movies, or just action movies in general."
" Best MCU Movie
",2020-11-11 00:00:00,10,This is the best MCU movie i have ever watched. I like all the fighting scenes and storyline.
" Greatest MCU standalone movie
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,9,"2014 is the best year not just for MCU so far, but for Marvel. The action sequences are AMAZING! The plot is well-done, and the villain is great. The Avengers is great, but it is overrated. This movie exceeds it."
" The Russos raise the bar
",2020-10-13 00:00:00,9,"With The Winter Soldier, the Russo brothers upped the action, the violence, the emotion and the cuts per action scene in a way that would make them the leading force of MCU goodness.I love how it evolves Cap's character from a likeable but simplistic patriot hero to a more complex hero who comes to realise his country isn't as great as he first thought, something he would have probably realised even if HYDRA didn't infiltrate SHIELD.It's a great movie and one of the most important in the series, even if most of the bug changes to the universe didn't fully stay, they still left a mark.Also, Danny Pudi has a cameo. Cool, cool cool cool."
" The dark knight of the mcu
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,10,Subverts your expectations in every way possible as marvel gets out of its stereotyped action sci-fi ground into this massive scaled political thriller
" One of marvels best movies
",2020-09-07 00:00:00,7,The first half can be a little bit confusing but other than that everything else is great. The direction by the Russo Brothers is terrific. The performances of the cast are amazing. The action scenes with the use of CGI and visual effects is outstanding. Definitely a must watch if you are a fan of the MCU.

" Captain America: The Winter Soldier review
",2020-08-26 00:00:00,8,Good actors. Fighting-scenes are good. Plot is okay.
" Amazing
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,10,Definitely one of the best! The story is well done and showed what heroes are like as people w a more humane side in normal life and situations instead of just comic characters. Also sick action.
" Probably my favorite movie ever
",2020-08-21 00:00:00,10,"I LOVE this movie!!! I think all the action/ fighting scenes were very well choreographed, and I liked how they didn't have to overly cut and crop the scenes to make the fighting look more real. There was also some subtle foreshadowing I enjoyed while re-watching it. I might be a bit biased because I'm a Captain America fan, but I would say this is the best movie Marvel has ever made. I've watched it over and over again. 10/10 would recommend."
" BEST ACTION.
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,8,"With one of the best action set pieces in the MCU, this spy thriller is not one you want to miss. The perfect continuation of the Captain America trilogy. The film handled the jump from war film to spy thriller without sacrificing the themes of the original and overarching plot relating to the relationship between Captain America and Bucky Barnes."
" Good but Bucky is a Boooring Villain (And Superhero, for that matter)
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,7,"Less a superhero entry and more of a neat throwback to '70s political thrillers -- esp with the inclusion of Robert Redford as the gov't bad-guy. But sooo much Bucky Barnes! Wouldn't be so bad if the Winter Solider was actually a compelling, interesting villain/superhero. As is, he barely gets 2 pages of dialogue in this 2 1/2 hour flick. And Sebastian Stan provdes here (and sorry, but later in the MCU, too) that he just can't act. He addds nothing to the most boring-ly written character in the MCU."
" On your left,,,
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,9,"At the time this came out, it was without a doubt the best movie to come out of the MCU. I look forward to seeing more from the Russo bros.While I thought the First Avenger was an incredible piece of work, this sequel is even better.So go watch it!!!"
" Sloppy writing saved by good action and one of my most favorite emotional endings
",2020-08-07 00:00:00,8,"Re-watching Winter Soldier in 2020 after the completion of the main story in Avengers Endgame simultaneously makes this movie better and worse.Some things became clearer, but some of the stuff that the characters say and some of their actions make less sense if you have seen Endgame and Captain Marvel. For example, there were a couple of throwaway lines from Nick Fury about how trusting people made him lost his eye, but Captain Marvel film doesn't really support this. Some of the stuff feels better (like the elevator scene) if you know how cool it will be handled in Endgame. Also, Black Widow looks in this film 10 years older than she does in Infinity War and Endgame and I'm not sure why.The film is kept floating above the water by creative and cool action, good CGI that holds up even 6 years later, good humor, great pacing that makes a 2hr movie feel like a 15 min short, and, of course, the emotional ending scene. And while the writing was kinda sloppy and barely held it together, many things didn't make a whole lot of sense even by comic book standards, the friendship between Rogers and Bucky and the ending performances get me every time. It's so simple yet so effective.Just makes me wish I had real friends."
" One of the worst MCU films
",2020-08-04 00:00:00,5,"I know this won't be a popular opinion, but this is one of my least favourite MCU films. It was a bombastic bore with a ludicrous plot and over-the-top CGI action scenes. Everything we know gets turned upside down but not in a good way. Most of the scenes left me quizzical."
" A Great Superhero Movie that Feels Darker
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,8,The Winter Soldier is an Excellent Marvel Movie. Its still very much in the same spirit of a typical Marvel film but it incorporates a lot of elements of Spy Thrillers. The stakes in this movie as well as the music make the action feel much better than usual superhero films. It has a good use of shaky cam as well. The Plot isn't something too impressive but it is serviceable for the overall experience and has some very interesting ideas. The Winter Soldier is in the upper echelon of Marvel Movies.
" Captain America: The Winter Solider
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,8,"Captain America: The Winter Solider, directed by the best two directors that MCU has on the team, in the Russo Brothers, crafted this well directed, brisk paced spy/action film, that has a lot to be praised for. The Russo Brothers took the MCU style, and completely flipped it into their own, which completely works, while becoming a model film for the MCU. They incorporated this darker and gritter tone, that essentially grounded the film well, while inevitably throwing in some well timed humor. Even though this new approach to the MCU was a breath of fresh air, the Russo Brothers set themselves up for some nitpicks, by transforming some things that were already set and stone, for the most part.The Winter Soldier does everything that a sequel should do, and that's improve on every aspect from the last film. The creative team told a juicer, more cohesive story, with better character involvement and development, while the action not only took a step up, but became one of the standout films for it's action sequences. Not only did they improve from the first installment, keeping the continuity involved, but they created one of, if not, the best stand-alone films the MCU has put out to date. The creative team utilized so many great layers and depth, to really break everything down, while adding in a tremendous amount of tention throughout the entire narrative.With Shield being the main focus of the film, I wasn't too sure on how things were going to play out, but because of the Russo Brothers creativity, I was perfectly okay with it! With Shield being center of attention, it allowed for Sam Jackson to have a lot more character moments, which had a heavy hand in the success of the film! Chris Evans is an absolute stud as Captain America and Steve Rogers! He is fleshed out much more, having the best character arch of the film. His character is a lot more complex this time around, other than being that public figure everyone knows him for. Evans steals every scene that he's in because of that genuine patriotism persona he carries, being nothing short of admirable. Scarlett Johansson was also another key contributor to the success of the film. We've seen her in a few films prior, getting a little bit more and more to do as the films go on, and she really sets out her skillset here. With decent chemistry and tention between her and Captain America, and her and Nick Fury, she shows once again, that she is capable of being an Avenger. Anthony Mackie gets his debut in the MCU as Sam Wilson/Falcon, and he is just an all around good addition. He doesn't add much as far as the superhero antics go, but he is a great compliment to Captain America, and the team. The Winter Soldier is a GAME villain! He doesn't have much to say, but his physical presence is quite enough for him to be a decent villain, with a great tie in to the series.This is probably one of the strongest screenplays by Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus. They wasted no time after The First Avenger, to hop right into the screenplay for this film. McFeely and Markus added a great amount of wit to this script, by making everything cohesive to the story, while incorporating some dialed down, yet sharp humor. They added a great deal of politics to the narrative, that isn't just all in your face; it flows extremely well with the story, feeling authentic.The action of the film was definitely the driving force of the film. All of the action scenes were shot so well, with many exciting and gritty action sequences! The Russo Brothers executed the hand-to-hand combat in such a professional way, and it just looked fantastic! The visual effects weren't heavily relied on, like they usually are, but when they were present, everything looked seamless.Overall, there is no reason why this film shouldn't be at the top of your list; one of the best the MCU has to offer !"
" What did you expect?
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,6,"It was fine. It's not especially unique for Marvel to present a fish out of water story, though Steve Rodger is rather likeable because we know his backstory, found it hard to care about Black Widow and Falcon. Maybe there should be a Black Widow movie so I can understand why she's relevant but I guess I've lost the point. It's kind of a let down after the original Avengers."
" A step up in quality...
",2020-07-05 00:00:00,8,"Another year, another collection of Marvel films, and fresh off the starting blocks is this sequel to the surprisingly decent First Avenger. A tour de force of action and humour, this is Marvel studios at their best. Chris Evans does a great job of playing Captain America, giving him the charisma and soul that he seemed to lack in the Avengers. Johansson was convincing as Black Widow, and seems to be getting noticeably better at acting with every film she does. Samuel L Jackson provides old school relief as Nick Fury, and has a much more substantial role this time round. The only disappointment for me was the Winter Soldier himself, who after being introduced as a mysterious and seemingly indestructible and lethal antagonist, gets watered down massively prior to the conclusion. Speaking of the conclusion, it felt a tad....well, stock to me. Overall though, it's highly entertaining viewing, especially for comic fans..."
" On your left
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,10,"I can't rave about this film enough! This is one of my favourite MCU films period. Great story line and the real start of getting this universe going. Great moments with Finding our Buckie is winter solider, Fury faking his death and coming back with his secret eye and the introduction of Falcon. This film is amazing."
" Captain America: The Winter Soldier
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,8,"It's so much better than the first one. In the first half, hand-held photography and aerial photography, close combat became the main component of action drama. In addition, all kinds of spy assassination dramas were almost spy movies. For a time, it was not even a superhero movie, but a spy movie with upgraded equipment. In the second half, the visual effect of a large movie was produced to climax before the original was restored."
" Best Made MCU Film
",2020-06-26 00:00:00,9,"The start of the Russo Era. This movie is highly ranked among MCU fans(mostly No.1), yes I do agree it is the best made MCU film, its just isn't my favourite.The action is spectacular, the hand to hand combat between Steve and Bucky was top notch choreography. They kept wide shots and less cuts, and in day light, we can clearly see all their moves. Action wise, this is the best in MCU but personally I don't weight action as much as I wait other factors.The story is also great, nazi-hyder still lying around in Shield was a great twist. Hyder never leaves Captain America. The Bucky twist also feels natural, brings a relationship element with the main villain. The flashbacks and past film does the job to set it up.Russo's got Natasha so right, she shined throughout the film, her action sequence were the most bad-ass female fight I have ever seen (right below Kill-Bill). She actually felt like a former deadly assassin of KGB, Scarlet Johansson played her well.Samuel L Jackson completely solds Nick Fury, his car sequence was great. His with his classic wits are spinkled all over the film. But his return from death was a let down. I hate when characters come back from death.
His lines 'Last Time I trusted someone, I lost an eye' , ' You need to keep both eyes open' were fantastic but sadly Captain Marvel happened.Addition of Sam Wilson was great, he brings the more organic feel to the film. His running gag of 'On your left' got better with Endgame. He isn't a perfect soldier but a good man, deserves the Captain America Mantle.Chris Evans sells as the patriot Steve Rogers, his characters arc progresses and we see him getting more further away from patriotism, doubting the government and agency (Shield/Hyder). ' This isn't freedom', and his speech at the end in Shield Headquarters was inspiring.I will never forget the lift scene, the comedy is more subtle and feels more mature. The movie could be called a political thriller. But this also has a very cliché ( most clichést thing in my book), saving brainwashed friend by reminding him of past greatness. The final action sequence was good but getting chips into ships to disarm them, felt cheap in relation to other great bits. Hyder killing all people just like any other villain would, isn't something new, the movie spent good quality time to connect the villain's tyreny to heros' in humane level but failed to connect why Hyder will go this big now. The movie's third act could have stayed more grounded just like the rest to the film.I highly respect the script and direction of the film, I just haven't seen it 50 times to love this film as much as I love the other once."
" Best Marvel movie made so far
",2020-06-23 00:00:00,10,"I have to start this review by saying that I'm a huge MCU fan. I rewatched all of them maybe once per year. Some of them are great and some of them are decent. But this is The Shiet. I rewatched it a lot of time and the movie still surprises me. The plot is smart,cursive and it's not getting boring despite the movie still being relatively long. Especially when the action starts I find myself on the edge on my seat wondering what will happen. Better than endgame and infinity war? Probably not but it's pretty damn close. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that wants to get more into the marvel universe or just looking for a fun and intense action movie"

" Captain America the winter Soldier
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,10,"This film is simply exceptional in every way. The edge it has is delivering the best, grittiest action the genre has ever scene and characters that are as complex as the are fun. Why do I say that? Well...What I love about the character is that Steve Rogers has ""I'm-a-man-out- of-time issues"" but he's comfortable with the chaos that it brings. In acclimating himself to this century he is at his best. Yes, most people would be overwhelmed but because of who he is and where he's from, he's able to cope and adapt. The serum that gives him his physical edge also gives him a mental boost. It's his emotions that are raw and unaided. Time has passed since Avengers so we don't get to see his day to day amazement and adjustment. I'm glad they skipped that stuff. What we do see is the man who once represented America and has become alien to America and it's slanted values. The passage of time. Add those struggles to a full blown conspiracy film and what results might just be the best film released all year long.Steve Rogers is basically a John Wayne American. The world shifts to him and it's his job to tell everybody ""Here's they way things should be done."" We saw that in Avengers and even the first film after he gathered his Howling Commandos. Now, the powers that be are a lot more flexible in terms of loyalties and how they're going to get certain jobs done. How he handles this century's gray morality is at the heart of the film.Like most men from the 1940's, Steve keeps things to himself and keeps his emotions bottled up. (EX: the first film when he mentions his mother dying of TB and he was even embarrassed when Peggy found him mourning alone for Bucky) So, bringing The Black Widow in to this film gives him someone who is going to draw out his story, because he's never going to offer it up of his own accord. Natasha learns from him. Fury learns from him. Sam Wilson learns from him. Yet, they all give him something in return. Every character used is utilized perfectly and smartly. Falcon for example, is not in awe of the legend of Captain America. This is exactly what Steve wants in a friend and in a fellow soldier, to not have to be Captain America. Everyone fits perfectly in to the plot and allows access to different beats, tones and emotional depth. Yes, conspiracy thrillers need depth and this one has it.Captain America is probably the only superhero left in this world of the reboot who is singularly heroic. He doesn't have this dark existential quandary like other reinventions. Plugging that resolute goodness into a morally complex story means he doesn't question what he believes, but he questions whether anybody else does anymore. He doesn't question his foundation but he questions where he has ended up and what his role must now be. The conspiracy element and structure of this story helps in that Captain America is not up on a pedestal being self righteous, he's in a corner and that makes you want to root for the guy. He believes in what he's doing and the viewer is along for a great ride sharing that belief.Marvel movies usually establish character early. This one starts out fast but it's got a lot of character in it. The first act packs a punch but does it laying the groundwork for a remarkable third act. They take time showing the issues and you immediately empathize with Steve. Giving us good character depth means the action delivers more punch. And the action here is beyond great. This movie absolutely punches you in the face in the best way possible. The action has advanced a lot from the first film. How he now operates in the world and kicks butt is all very impressive.So, this is probably Marvel's grittiest movie and it's also their best sequel to date. There's a dash of humor but there's mostly a wonderful thriller, conspiracy and adventure that delivers a great great film."
" An entertaining sequel
",2020-06-01 00:00:00,7,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a superhero movie directed by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo and stars Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Robert Redford and Samuel L. Jackson in the leads.The sequel movie of the Captain America Franchise might not be that good but will not disappoint you.The plot is almost similar to other Marvel movies and you will not find anything new with few twists which are predictable. Screenplay is fast paced but is average and should've been more refined. VFX and action are the best part of the movie.Acting and background music is strong. The climax is also predictable but is entertaining. The best part of the movie is strong acting With great VFX and entertaining climax but the bad part is that the director hasn't tried to do much in giving the experience of great from good.Typical marvel fans and kids will surely enjoy this movie."

" S*** just got REAL
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,8,"SYNOPSIS:
It appears that HYDRA has infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D and are hatching a plan that will end up killing millions. It's up to Captain America (Chris Evans) and some other to prevent this, however, they have to get through The Winter Soldier first.REVIEW:
The Russo's are here! It's actually crazy how much of a step forward this film is from every film is before it. The technical aspects of this film are spot on. The choreography of this film was so far ahead and above any of the MCU films before it. The directing style is on another level and I don't know how the Russo's do it. They take a relatively mediocre plot and a not very interesting character like ""The Winter Soldier"" and make it one of the most interesting films and one of the most badass villains in the entire MCU. You feel every punch and kick. Finally, a normal human goes flying when being kicked in the chest by a superhuman Chris Evans. Then you have the plot twist when you find out who The Winter Soldier is and that entire aspect was very interesting and a ""holy s***"" moment. This film literally has Robert Redford! Like, come on! One issue I had with the film was at the end when someone doesn't die that should very clearly been dead. Like there's no way any regular human ever lives from it. I won't go further in the small chance someone who hasn't seen the film is reading this. In conclusion, this is one of the best films in the entire MCU and I can't wait to see it again. 8.9/10."
" What an Amazing Addition to Marvels Movie List 🗻
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,10,What a Movie. Great Writing and the Story was so good 👍.I never thought they could equal the First Avenger but they have.Amazing Visuals too.
" First great marvel movie
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,9,"This was the ninth MCU movie and hands down the best one yet (IMO) when it was released. They finally had a complex interesting layered story that matched the action effects. To me, this one was the real beginning of the saga that carried through the two Infinity War movies. It did not tie in with the Infinity Stones but captured the style that made the subsequent ones so good."
" Best MCU movie
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,10,"It's not the biggest, the cutest, or the funniest. It's just the best stand alone production among all the MCU projects."

",2020-05-16 00:00:00,8,"The spirit conveyed by the character of the US team is still very moving, passionate, patriotic, upright and courageous, and never withdraw from bullying."
" The best Movie of MCU
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,10,"The first time I watched this movie I didn't pay attention to all the amazing things it has, but I decided to watch again, and I have realized that it is the best movie of Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is the ninth film produced by Marvel studios and it was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. It is a direct sequel of Captain America: The first avenger, so we follow the adventure of Captain America/Steve Rogers(Chris Evans) Black widow/Natasha Romanoff (Scarlet Johansson) and Falcon/ Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) against an occulted enemy, a corporation named Hydra which is hidden inside the most powerful government agency: SHIELD. Hydra controls the best friend of Steve rogers, Bucky Barnes called as the Winter soldier (Sebastian stand), so Captain America wants to save him. Other important characters are Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and the main enemy, Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford).
This Movie has an excellent storytelling, you always are excited about what could happen. It is not only a Superheroes movie, it has many characteristics of spy movies, It has a real breath-taking plot which affects all the MCU; And also is a critic of American way of life, what if the government could know (or believe) what crimes will happen before they actually happen? Is it right to punish the people who haven't done anything bad...yet? The Captain America don't think so, there's a moral dilemma. That's why this movie goes much far that any Marvel's movies.
The effects are spectacular, the movie has the perfect mix between practical effects and CGI, so every scene looks amazing, specifically the melee fights and the helicarriers destruction. The music is not the best, but it is okay, it gives tension and emotion when the movie needs. Another point I think is cool is that there aren't too much jokes as almost all Marvel's movies.
It is amazing, but not everything is good, there are many things that have no sense, for example, how Nick Fury could scape from the Winter soldier when his car crashed? It was a big coincidence that there was an sever just where the car stopped . And there are things about this movie that other Marvel's movies don't take care about , for example how Fury lost his eye, in Captain Marvel a cat scratched him in his eye... but in the winter soldier Nick Says "" The last time I trusted I lost an eye"" It was so stupid! Another at the end of the movie, Nick burned his patch but in avengers: Age of Ultron he has it again. It is so sad that not everything has connection between movies.
So, it is amazing, everyone who likes action, suspense, and thought-provoking movies should watch Captain America: The winter Soldier."
" Awesome.
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,9,(4.5 out of 5 stars).Great action. Love the second movie. It does have a political thriller feel with the movie which had an uneven pacing. The cast is great. The action sequences are awesome. The winter soldier was an awesome villain. This movie was an improvement over the last.
" Is this the best MCU movie? YES
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,10,"It's 2020. I'm rewatching MCU movies while in quarantine. Endgame came out last year. And it did everything we fans wanted. It's the highest grossing film right now. But even with all the fan services Endgame (& other MCU movies) gave us along with big cgi battles in 4 Avengers movies and all the colorful Guardians movies + Ragnarok, Winter Soldier still is the best thing MCU delivered us. Rather than being a fun, colorful hero vs villain fight Winter Soldier gives us something else. It's suspenseful, it's thrilling, it's badass. The action scenes are so well done especially that Cap vs Bucky (that knife flip is too good). Also the elevator scene, Cap's monologue, Falcon, Black Widow, the first action sequence everything is just perfect. My favorite thing about this movie is that it starts the journey of badass Steve Rogers (before we get started, does anyone wanna....) instead of just a guy on steroids talking about patriotism. Also the Winter Soldier is still the coolest villain (Taskmaster might change that).I normally don't write reviews. Not even on MCU movies. But I need the world to know that this right here is the best MCU movie. Even after the biggies like Infinity War & Endgame (I love those movies btw) this simple political thriller stands at the no. 1 posting of MCU. Russo Brothers didn't only delivered their first MCU film they also delivered their best MCU film."
" Jerk Cap: Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Hate Marvel
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,2,"This movie was the point that Marvel started going downhill for me. The action scenes are shaky, unexciting, and nauseating. The plot is a rip off of the Manchurian Candidate, a much better movie. The Russo Bros are complete hacks, if you don't believe me look up their filmography before they were drafted into making subpar Marvel films. The reason that elevator scene is so praised is because it's the only action scene in the movie where the camera isn't bouncing all over the place trying to disguise the cheap CGI. The whole movie hasn't aged well at all in six years, I dread to know how it will be viewed in twenty.At least this was the last Marvel movie to remember that Cap was supposed to be from the 40s."
" Easily one of the best entries in the Marvel cinematic universe
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,8,"Easily one of the best entries in the Marvel cinematic universe, The Winter Soldier is as much of a top-notch action thriller as it is a superhero blockbuster. It has a compelling premise, engaging story, and exciting action set pieces. If there are any real complaints, it's with the climax, where the action begins to go a little too over-the-top.
However, even at its most bombastic, the Russo's always manage to keep the action in service to the story."
" Maybe the best MCU movie
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,10,"The fact that I rate this movie with 10 is not an exaggeration. This particular movie I really consider to be the best of MCU as the character development, the story, the action scenes, the direction and many more details still shock you.It could be said that this is a political drama with a strong Marvel dose in it. The dialogues are also excellent and careful written as well as the casting.
I understand that many other movies like Infinity War, Avengers etc. are considered by most to be 'better', but if you watch this specific movie twice or more, you will realize that you are facing a masterpiece in all respects. In most parts of it, you think that you are in the movie and you feel that you are experiencing the emotions of the characters. In my humble personal opinion, I will repeat that Captain America: Winter Soldier is a masterpiece and will always be my number one Marvel movie."
" An Action-Packed MCU Thriller
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,8,"What's not to like about this movie? It tells a very personal story for Steve Rogers, one that explains where he stands later on in the Civil War. It is much more grounded than the first one, which is also a nice change of pace after watching some of the previous movies in the MCU. I love when the series goes in that direction, which is why this one is right up there with Iron Man in my current ranking.I still have to rank this one slightly below the MCU's first film, simply because I just have more fun when watching Tony Stark's origin story. However, it's my third favorite so far, and I am pretty sure that it will end up in my top ten."
" A friendship you'll crave for
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,9,"The close friendship between Steve Rogers and Bucky is brilliant in this movie, and truly does make Captain America an amazing and highly respected character with his outstanding heroism.Plot complexity: 16.5/20
It had a great twist at the end, Hydra are great villains. I liked how Captain America was on the run from everybody pretty much, but at the same time wanted to find a way to get to Bucky.Characters: 9/10
Brilliant characters with good actors to play them. Captain America is one of my all time best characters, and Bucky isn't far off either. Most of the characters had interesting backstories, interesting personalities and interesting roles in the film. Sharon Carter could've been fleshed out a bit more though.Consistency: 9.5/10
There wasn't an awful scene in the movie, but a scene or two involving Peggy's daughter was a bit mediocre.Emotion: 9/10
This had many emotional scenes, like Steve visiting Peggy on her deathbed, and Steve refusing to fight Bucky were the highlights of the emotional scenes."
" Action, social-political critique and Marvel Comics' screenplay: the consolidation
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,10,"The sequence of Captain America delivers a great mix of entertainment, social-political critique and action. It is enriched with a elaborated plot, great characters construction and development, and an impeccable cinematography.
The high point of the movies it i its plot. I guess the adaptation of the Marvel Comics of Simon and Kirby gave Markus and McFeely an logical, consistent, coherent and visionary base for the screenplay. Furthermore, the could develop a solid critique about national security, confidence, loyalty and ideology. All of this with a frenetic action rhythm that evolves with the main plot, a spicy taste of entertainment in the movie.
The characters are well constructed based on the screenplay and also thanks to the awesome acting. None of the actors stood out, because they all made a amazing set.
The Russo Brother got a perfect action and well-adapted screenplay and used all of their experience to create a cinematographic environment that could consolidated the Marvel Universe, action, entertainment and critique, without loosing rhythm and missing spots."
" Still one of the best MCU movies to date.
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,10,"Honestly. Where to begin? Look, I adore Tony Stark. A personal favorite character in the entirety of all MCU, but I gotta say, Captain America always busted out the best titular solo films in MCU and this movie is proof of why Captain America has the best movies.Just everything. EVERYTHING about this movie was just so amazing. Couldn't live with watching it only once, so I went back to watch it 4 more times and it was still great. You got direct reccuring conflict from the first Captain America movie. Bringing back old foes and having them conspiring underneath the good guys noses and exposing S.H.I.E.L.D for its own corruption by its own commanding Nick Fury. Just to show you even the 'good guys' get their hands dirty too for selfish reasons when they feel they have to.You get a building companionship between two of the core Avengers that DID NOT end in a romance. Which was surprising to me that this movie didn't just go for the classic guy and girl work together and eventually fall in love trope that Hollywood uses so often. And the best part was that Johansson and Evans lovingly sold the chemistry, and it almost lead me to believe that they're characters would begin a relationship. And despite everything those characters went through together, the bond between them stayed professional and comforting in the end. How very well played Marvel. Very mature.The Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes is still one of the most intimidating and most formidable villains in the MCU of all time. He still beats Thanos. Every time he showed up on or before he showed up, you could always feel a lingering sensation of eerie dread for what's about to come next. It's thrilling and terrifying. The Winter Soldier is the epitome of 'Silent but deadly.' Sebastian Stan was just outstanding as the Winter Soldier. Easily one of the strongest performances in the film. He nailed that deadly assassin with no remorse or second thoughts and also nailed the confused and lost feeling of not knowing where to find the true Bucky he was. Sebastian had to play two completely different sides to one character and nearly made me cry in his final moments with Cap. Also, not only was The Winter Soldier a great character, but it was smart that they reintroduced this semi-minor sidekick friend character from the first Captain America movie who we all thought was dead, dug him out of his 'grave' and turned him into a shadowy deadly villain who struggles to break from the mind control that's forcing him to become a soldier of death. The strongest aspect of the film.Also loved how this movie gace screen time to Natasha and Nick Fury to really show off their skills in espionage more so than the other movies they were featured in. It did right by both of the characters by giving some levity to them and established them way more. Especially Natasha because we are only told of her skills and shown that she's capable of weaponry, but we didn't really see a lot of her espionage to use. We got a bit of it in Iron Man 2, but this movie highlighted her for who she is. Also, even though we know what kind of a character Nick Fury is, it showed us how capable, strong and manipulative he really is. I just loved seeing him during the Car scene assassination attempt on his life. Samuel L Jackson always knows how to give a performance.I'll just say it again, EVERYONE gave a delightful performance. Evans, Johansson, Jackson, Stan, Mackie, Redford, and everyone else brought their A-Game. Great acting, realistic conversations, and epic lines that are just so fitting to the characters they portray. The emotional sentiment in some scenes was just right on the money.Ok now. Now, we're talking fight choreography. My heart could give out, but whoever choreographed those fight scenes needs more than just an Oscar. I cannot reiterate how and why the fight choreography in this movie is the best in all MCU. Maybe Civil War comes close, but this movie has some of the most bone-chilling fights I've ever seen in any action film. Just...that highway fight between Cap and The Winter Soldier terrified me with glee if you can understand. Some of the most intricate fight I've seen. The way the shield and knife were handled was just above and beyond. As much as I adore the elevator fight in this movie, the highway was better.Music was chilling and emotional too. Nothing more can be said. I just love how the composer was so dark on incorporating Bucky's scream from when he 'died' in The First Avenger and mechanalized it into the theme for the Winter Soldier. How eerie and devastating. Just love it.Gosh, what a movie. Best MCU movie ever. Even after Endgame and Infinity War, still the best movie ever. The only movie that could possibly beat this would have to be Civil War. That being said, as far as a spy-action thriller, it was just right about everything. Still incorporating that nice humor for a darker toned movie like all Marvel does. The best understanding of these characters since Iron Man and The Avengers.Just brilliant.10.3/10"
" Bad tactics equals bad writing
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,5,"At minute 13:00 in the movie, Captain America, the character, and Captain America, the movie, do something that is unforgivably awful. They fail to neutralize a hostile. I am not an expert in warfare, nor do I play one on TV, but the one absolute that must always, always, always happen in a combat situation is that you completely neutralize your target--you make it ineffective. So many movies and TV shows transgress this obvious rule that for media the rule should usually be the opposite--leave hostile forces hanging around, fully capable of wreaking mayhem.But just because it's transgressed in media doesn't make the tactic forgivable much less laudable when it's done. It just speaks of poor writing. If the character needs to escape, write it in the script that he/she escaped some other way. Don't spend ten minutes showing how tactically advanced your troops are, just to have them idiotically leave a hostile ready to catch the troops unaware. That makes it look like they have stupid soldiers despite years and millions of dollars of training and advanced weaponry.To add insult to injury, Captain America, the self-righteous, just after the 13:00 minute mark, goes on to tell Black Widow that she has jeopardized the mission despite his blunder that will, within a matter of seconds, almost cost both of them their lives.At the moment, I can no more rate the entire movie than predict the end of the world because I haven't seen it. I have watched up to 13:23 because I had to get up in disgust and walk away from it. I have given it a neutral 5 because I suppose it will redeem itself somewhat later.One possibility that the writers are really trying to say is that Captain America, the character is stupid, that he's an arrogant moron, a big fat loser, a washed-up has-been blow-hard. If that is the case, and I'm not betting that it is at this point, then kudos to the writers for nailing him to the wall. It's a effective way to make him look stupid and arrogant. It certainly works with the character Tony Stark in Iron Man. The character's hubris and flaws are served up for him to be knocked down and humiliated. Maybe Captain America needs it as well. I'll find out. If I can convince myself to keep watching."

While its definitely the most serious of the movies, it still manages to have little moments of subtle humor that we've all loved since ""Iron Man."" Nick Fury plays his biggest part yet in this movie, and Black Widow is an important factor in the plot as well. Even though this is a superhero movie, it's not just turn off your brain and enjoy. It has a complex plot that you have to pay attention to. As always stay halfway through the credits, and until the end. Both scenes are extremely important to the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

A really well presented superhero blockbuster in the modern world with a real stoic protagonist from the treacherous World War II eras. Now, in modern day society, the Super Soldier is a deserving member to join the rest of the supporting characters that ultimately plan to wipe out HYDRA's plans. With a veteran protagonist killed by an unknown adversary of Rogers makes the movie more jaw-dropping; will he return? Will he not? Nick J. Fury... does he live? Does he die?

",2020-03-19 00:00:00,9,"This sequel was repositioned as a spy action movie with great success. The melee combat is very good. The story is closely related to the first episode and accelerates the progress of the Marvel Universe. , Overall, at least ten times better than the first one."
" Awesome Action and Worth Watching! Entertaining as Well
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,10,"I loved the fight between Bucky and Captain America.The cool part was when Captain America threw his shield at him, but Bucky caught it which surprised him.The ending was great. I was surprised to see Falcon since I didn't know he had a suit too. Thought he was just a random person that jogged along with Captain America.It is good to watch this if you want to know where Falcon and Bucky came about."

" Fantastic story

" Extremely good action movie
",2020-03-14 00:00:00,10,"First class piece of action filmmaking where the producers took the time to get the storyline right and the visuals are never less than spot on. I'm not a Marvel fan and from the descriptions it didn't sound interesting - i.e. Captain America, but I can't recommend this highly enough."
" It was everything I wasnt hoping for.
",2020-03-10 00:00:00,4,"This is just another average marvel movie. Cheesy one liners with weak corporate villains, lame sods characters and an ok main character. I don't know what it is about Captain America, but hes not the superhero I'd want to hang out with. Hes almost robotic, the patriotism and hero nature of his character over bears who he really is. His personality doesn't come through clearly. Which means you just watching another action movie where you know the good guy will always win no matter how ridiculous the scenarios get. At one point he gets shot in his back, at this point I wonder how on earth has he gone this long without getting shot? I thought they were playing on the fact that his body could repel bullets. Of he can be shot, why has no one ever gone to shoot his legs underneath his shield?And speaking of shield, these guys ruin the whole movie for me. I could not care less about villains on a hologram screen in suits telling one top dog all the ways they've gone wrong. The sooner they're out the better.You could miss this whole movie in the marvel series and not notice. In fact I did do this. This is the main marker in the fact that this movie does nothing for Captain Americas character development or the overall story!"
" While almost all other superhero movies are generic, this is a 10/10 !
",2020-03-04 00:00:00,10,"I found the first one pretty bad, thus I was reluctant to go see this one too. Thankfully, having watched a promising trailer, I went to the cinema to watch this... oh yeah!This turned out to be one of my favorite films of all time and it made me a great fan of Captain America's character due to his ethos. It's remarkable, that initially, from the first movie, I found that same character completely dull. I should also mention the amazing bad guy (the Winter Soldier), who is almost as appealing - if not more - than Captain America!In a current world filled with superhero movies with generic/shallow plots & characters and with kids as the only target group (too many over-simplifications so that the story can move forward), Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a gem! It doesn't just differentiate from that superhero mass, it's also one of the greatest action spy (superhero) films.
P.S. I've gone to the cinema for very few MARVEL and even less DC films, intentionally. I wasn't convinced from the trailers. I have watched almost all of the MARVEL ones though, because of curiosity. Hats off for their very successful blockbuster machine based on inter-connection between the plots of all their films (though often in an ultimately insignificant way!) and, hence, addiction. I do want to mention my 5 most noticeable films from them. Thor 2 and Avengers 2 were kind of enjoyable. Captain America: Civil War was good I guess, although ultimately, I think I was satisfied more because of the hype to the release and less because of the actual film - I didn't like the bitter taste it left me with. Then, Avengers: Infinity War was bitterly addictive. And lastly, Avengers: Endgame was a complete let-down. A complete let-down. Thankfully, that last one - the so-called culmination - made me come to the healthy conclusion... that I'm done with superhero movies! I choose to remember only Captain America: The Winter Soldier!"
" A whole atmosphere of espionage, action thriller, a sense of constant threat that grows and unfolds over time
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,9,"Even in the comics, the Captain was always closer to reality. In the first film, he was fighting Nazis. In the aftermath, current controversial topics like drone bombings, illegal espionage by the NSA and WikiLeaks, the publics temptation to surrender their civil liberties in exchange for a sense of security. At one point in the film, for someone who trusts in human potential, Steve Rogers decision to wear his classic uniform again at a defining moment represents a man who faces a corrupt present with ideological weapons from the past, aiming to create a better future.With just over two hours of projection, there is time to develop Captain America/Steve Rogers. This man's honor is even more evident and put to the test with today's conflicts. In fact, it is interesting to see the Captain, who slept for decades, still looking for an adaptation to today's world, of new inventions, technology and the behavior of society in general. And let's face it, two years is a short time for those who have lost decades of humanity. Steve's notebook in which he writes down tips of things he has lost in the past few decades and should update himself is a great example of this. This conflict of the past adapting to today's world was an expected theme.Other important aspects that place Rogers in his current emotional state at the beginning of the film, is Steve's melancholic reunion with his aging girlfriend Peggy (Hayley Atwell). The hero's quest to locate himself in a world whose morals are portrayed in increasingly gray tones is his main conflict. Has the good man now been relegated to a simple museum piece In fact, Steve's visit to the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History exhibit does not have an egotistical character, but it does show an individual recalling the values for which he fought and bled. Seeing that chapter of his life, returning in a painful way, both in Peggy's illness, in the threatening form of the Winter Soldier and in the ghosts of Zola (Toby Jones) and the fascism of the organization HYDRA.
In Captain America the Winter Soldier, certain aspects already present in the characters first film are even more present and guide the entire narrative of this plot. There is a whole atmosphere of espionage, action thriller, a sense of constant threat that grows and unfolds over time, involving conspiracy, betrayals, investigation, spectacular escapes, persecutions in the correct pace of spectacular action. Here, brothers Anthony and Joe Russo move the action according to the narrative amidst many dialogues and an intriguing plot. The action is never exaggerated and unbalanced, besides being directed with extreme competence. Directors abuse high-speed action scenes on highways, in bold camera frames that put you into the action and, for the most part, shot in broad daylight, which makes it much more complicated to hide any misuse of effects, which never happens. Another merit is the high number of scenes of corporal fight, without abrupt cuts, seeking to use more open plans and sequence plans.These action sequences and visual effects are present from the first to the last minute and, as always, are impeccable. We witnessed a great sequence, right at the opening, when the Captain, alongside his team of trained SHIELD agents, invaded a ship hijacked by pirates and, shortly after, the attack suffered by Nick Fury on the streets of Washington, in addition to the persecution of the Winter Soldier to the Captain, Black Widow and Hawk around town, and obviously in all the action present in the last act of the film after the discovery of the great conspiracy involving HYDRA, which extended its tentacles within the spy agency SHIELD and seeks to materialize a megalomaniacal plan involving the aircraft of the Insight project. Incidentally, this last act can be compared in scale and quality to that seen previously in The Avengers.Anthony and Joe Russo have a simple plot in hand, but it is complicated at certain times by editing, especially in explaining the main plot at the old Captains training site, but that does not compromise understanding. In general, the viewer will see, as in the previous films of the other characters, an evolution in the character's narrative line, which will bring consequences at the end of phase 2 in The Age of Ultron. The combination of an impactful action in a context that mixes espionage, suspense, unexpected twists is very well dosed. Even though the film has a more serious tone, with a real threat to the characters, humor, even to a lesser extent, is present, as it could not help missing. Together with The Avengers (2012), it is perhaps the best film from Marvel Studios, and represents a huge leap in quality for the studio."
" Incredible film
",2020-02-29 00:00:00,8,"Captain America was pulpy fun, but this builds from the first film and delivers an action packed ride. Strong filmmaker style and a 70s paranoid style plot save what could've been a giant mess. The ending is a mess, but the first two parts of the film are relentless. The standard Marvel too much hurts this in the end. Phase 2 delivered some of the best films of the Marvel series and The Winter Soldier was an incredible action film."
" Amzimg
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,9,I just watched this movie after a long time and realised how awesome it was!!
" Another great film in the MCU
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,8,"I always thought Captain America was a corny ""golden age of comics"" superhero that had long passed his expiration date. I was shocked by how much I liked him in his first film. I was delighted to grow to like him even more in this one. They set up the character beautifully in the first movie, but he explodes as a hero here. It's hard to fault the character or this movie. Not just the MC, but the whole cast was well written and acted here. The action is well directed and tense. Battles feel much more real than most Marvel battles. There was much less obvious CGI than most films in the franchise, and it pays off. This is one of the best Marvel films to date. Lightning in a bottle. A highlight in the MCU."
" Better then it should be
",2020-02-21 00:00:00,7,"Anyone managing for me to care about a superhero movie, much less a Captain America movie deserves kudos. well played live action, actual fight and car scenes that were more Bond then Marvel, and some twists."
" First of all, it shouldn't be underestimated how making a Marvel film that feels like a leap forward,
",2020-02-18 00:00:00,7,"Retains some authorship, has relevance AND fits in with the MCU juggernaut, is a damn tough thing to do.Secondly, Cap is a badass. Continuously badass. In this movie he speaks softly and carries a big stick. Chris Evans (easily Marvel's best characterisation) plays a wholesome, troubled heartthrob of a superhero. He's a very watchable actor, making this film look easy.Yes, it does suffer from some overstuffed and CGI reliant third act claptrap, but even though I could see the twists a mile off, my girlfriend didn't, reminding me that these movies aren't just for comic aficionados.Being a child of so many world, it's a miracle that Winter Soldier comes out as successful and revitalising as it does. It's the anti-Man of Steel: silly, loud, stuffed, but every cylinder is firing, everybody is on point and everything gels to create a cohesive thrillride."
" Captain America winters Soldier
",2020-02-15 00:00:00,9,Chris Evans does not disappoint in this trailer Phase 1 of the captain and America franchise. Samuel Jackson Scarlett Johansson were also very good in this picture. Even Robert Redford made an appearance. Highly recommend this and all the Marvel movies.
" Possibly my favorite action in a movie
",2020-02-07 00:00:00,9,"Anthony and Joe Russo showed that they can do action, direction, compelling characters, and a gripping story. This is my favorite Marvel movie after GotG, it develops both Natasha's and Steve's character as well as introducing a new character, Sam Wilson, in perhaps my favorite character introduction of all time. 9.3/10"
" What a movie
",2020-02-03 00:00:00,9,"Honestly can not even begin to explain what I just watched. WHAT A MOVIE! Simply one of the best MCU or if not the best one I've watched everything is on point. Story driven movie with amazing cinematography, great hand to hand combat and great message regarding ideas of freedom, security and patriotism. Russos did an excellent job and I hope more marvel movie utilise hand to hand combat mixed with great story driven narrative like this movie did."
" Do not trust anyone
",2020-01-16 00:00:00,10,"It is possible to say that our invincible hero made an impressive return to the big screen with his subject. This time, both the HYDRA organization and the Winter Soldier, a myth and death machine.acting is very good.a complete visual feast."
" Best standalone marvel movie
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,10,"Winter soldier is a political thriller disguised as a marvel movie and i loved it. It raised questions on the ethics of technology, privacy and the application of it by governing bodies... all while captain america, black widow and falcon acted as a straight up wrecking crew, breathing new life into their characters. Barring maybe some of the bigger budget ensemble movies, this was clearly the best, most well thought out movie in the MCU."
" 7.7? Seriously? This is the best mcu film.
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,10,"Seriously don't understand why the score is so low. This film was fabulously done. The action is awesome especially the elevator scene. Also it's not an avengers movie, so you arent following 20 different people. One of my favorite movies"

" An Amazing Film That Cements Itself In This Crazy Universe
",2019-12-12 00:00:00,9,"This film might be my top three films that Marvel has ever produced, even after Endgame. I might even go as far and say that it's my number one favorite movie from Marvel. Some people might call me crazy, naming Winter Soldier my number one film when Infinity War and Endgame exists, but let me explain why this film might be my favorite film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.This film calls back to The First Avenger. A movie set in the 1940's in which we see Steve Rogers become Captain America for the first time. With many references to the First Avenger's love interest, his enemies, and friend-turned-foe, we continue to see Steve Rogers re-evaluating what he thought he once knew. From the 1940's to 2010's, Steve Rogers is truly ""a man out of time"". This modern age of espionage that he is living in gives up privacy and a right to a fair judgement in turn for complete safety throughout the nation. Despite finding out that S.H.I.E.L.D. has the ability to eliminate anyone they see as a threat before they can actual become a threat, as the righteous man he is, he stays true to his core belief, because the way he sees it, ""that's not freedom, it's fear."" We see his internal struggle with his morality and what the modern age of espionage has become and is simply trying to find his place in a world that was once so much simpler than now.Things get even more complicated when a person from his past returns in the present. Surprised by this turn of events, he can't help but wonder if he could've done anything to prevent things from turning out the way they did. He blames himself for the creation of the Winter Soldier, but blames himself even more that he can't seem to pull the Winter Soldier from the brink of darkness. It creates an interesting dilemma that ponders the question, ""What happens if you put someone who won't give up fighting for his friend against someone who won't stop until he finishes his mission?""The spy genre really works well with the Captain America series. It's interesting take on a Marvel character who normally goes up against global threats in a red, white and blue costume. By putting him in this espionage setting, with a darker uniform, and obstacles that have him reaffirm his morals, and opting out of the big CGI spectacular of villains, it makes the film a lot more grounded and real. It poses questions that are relevant in today's society about government interference in the nation's freedom.The choreography in this film is just truly spectacular. The stunts, the fights, the shots. They all are visually appealing. Not only that, but because of the groundedness of the film, it allows us to appreciate the more intricate parts of the fights. Every time Captain America and Winter Soldier go toe-to-toe, you can't not be amazed at how well done the fight scenes are.Captain America: The Winter Soldier takes a character from the past who generally is a hopeful and morally righteous person and places him in darker, modern day society, working for an agency which has him question his beliefs. This spy genre is certainly something that isn't new, but this film does a great job in combining the spy genre with the superhero genre. And what is created is something that will leave you in awe the first time you see it, and in disbelief the subsequent times you see it, because how can a movie be THIS good?"
" Best of the Captain America MCU Trilogy, A thrilling action blockbuster
",2019-12-11 00:00:00,8,"What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said. It's one of the finest superhero movies ever made, it really made me feel satisfied and really blew me away on just how sharply shot the action was in this movie. It's at this point in time where the action directing in the MCU franchise really started to rise up dramatically and the action scenes in this movie are shot with clarity and prescision. The Winter Soldier is a great villan and really was the best villan in the MCU at that point. His design is slick and very modern looking and looks intimidating aswell which is exactly what you want from a superhero villan.Chris Evans as Steve Rodgers is also great in the movie as his character has grown stronger and is now living comfortably in 2010s America. Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury is back aswell and is awesome as always. The story has upped it's game and has become more emotional with some truly heart wrenching scenes aswell as some really good tension aswell when the characters clash against one anotherOverall a crisp, thrilling and just plain fun MCU movie with the best shot action at the time for a Marvel movie. It was my favourite Action movie of 2014 and my personal favourite in the Captain America MCU trilogy"
" Best of the Bunch
",2019-11-27 00:00:00,10,"This has been, and still is, my favourite Marvel movie of all time. Well written, acted, and the score is unbelievably epic and fitting for each scene. Not to mention the addition of The Winter Soldier to the Marvel heroes is another pleasant surprise.Please, whatever you do, DON'T SKIP THIS MOVIE!"
" The best MCU movie
",2019-11-25 00:00:00,8,"The first twenty minutes or so of this movie establish so much so well, it feels like the Marvel franchise has finally grown up.The opening scene takes place around the Mall in Washington D.C. as Captain Rogers takes in his morning run, lapping a young ex-soldier several times. When the two finally speak, there's a grounded sense of community between the two stemming from their dual tours of duty in wars separated by decades. It's the physical detail that Sam brings up about the over-softness of mattresses contrasted against the reality of their sleeping arrangements in the theaters of war that sells it so well. Rogers and Sam have this immediate connection because of that shared experience that makes Rogers showing up to a group therapy session for veterans instantly believable. He's not showing up because he's Captain America and it's what Captain America would do. He's showing up because he's got his own scars and wonders if spending time with others who have similar experiences could help.That's the kind of grounded reality that storytelling should reach for. It's not about being grounded in a recognizable physical reality but in a recognizable emotional and human reality. The movie around that emotional core is still ridiculous with a super soldier created by a magic blue serum, another soldier with a metal arm that's been repeatedly frozen over the decades, flying aircraft carriers, and a suit with jets and wings, but because it pays attention to the human element so well that crazy stuff gains a more entertaining dimension because it's at service to an actual story dealing with characters that feel real.What's most interesting about the film's construction is that it uses the human element so well in a paranoid thriller context. The presence of Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce is no accident. His presence calls to mind Three Days of the Condor and All the President's Men.Captain America is sent on a mission into the middle of the ocean to rescue some SHIELD operative on a boat that's been taken over by French-Algerian pirates. Cap succeeds, of course, and his partner Natasha (Black Widow) is there with a secondary purpose, to steal information from the ship. Rogers rankles at this undermining of his authority over the mission and confronts SHIELD director Nick Fury about it. Fury insists that secrets are necessary in order for him to effectively lead the organization and that Rogers is going to have to get used to compartmentalization in the modern world. After Fury brings some concerns to Pierce, a member of SHIELD's governing body the Council, Fury gets attacked on the streets of D.C. He escapes to Rogers' apartment, gets shot through a wall, and Rogers gives chase to the assailant, The Winter Soldier, who is actually Bucky Barnes, Rogers' best friend from childhood who had been brainwashed into being a killing machine.Rogers and Natasha begin to suspect that SHIELD has been compromised and after a couple of instances of SHIELD proving that beyond a reasonable doubt, the two go on the run. They essentially go back in time in finding the original bunker that SHIELD operated out of, inhabited by the computerized brain of Dr. Zola, the Swiss scientist who had helped Hydra in the first Captain America movie. Hydra, he reveals, had infiltrated SHIELD decades before, sowing chaos around the world and taking control of the organization as a whole.This is one of the only times Marvel dealt with geopolitical issues in any meaningful way. The idea that an intelligence apparatus that nominally represents the will of the people is actually deeply rooted in its own version of state interests feels almost ripped from the headlines. The idea of outsourcing killing decisions to a program and using drones feels just the same. And yet, the movie never gets bogged down with it. It takes a side against these things and plows forward, understanding that it is more action movie than political treatise. What this does is create an interesting canvas on which to tell this story, lending credence to the emotions that Rogers is going through as he sees an organization that had earned his trust fall before his eyes.Of course, Rogers decides to fight it out, and he recruits Sam, the Falcon, as well as Natasha. We get a great extended action sequence across three helicarriers as they rise against a ticking clock that the heroes are fighting to beat. It really comes to a head on the third ship when the Winter Soldier and Captain America face off. These aren't just two people on the opposite sides of good and bad at the dictates of a screenwriter, these are people with pasts and ideals that throw them in conflict. But, instead of wanting to see Rogers simply win against Bucky, Rogers needs to save Bucky from the fate he's found himself in. It's a non-traditional way to end a large action sequence, and it works really well because of the emotional work done early. It all fits as well because of the thematic underpinnings. Rogers is haunted by his past and worried about his future. Bucky is a physical manifestation of that worry and concern. He was the friend he lost in battle, but he also represents a more hopeful future if Rogers can reach him.Action scenes overall range from being filmed too close to coherent within that shaky-cam box. They're edited really well, but I just wish the Russo's has pulled the camera back a bit more and kept it a bit more still from time to time. There's a visual thing that feeds into everything as well. Captain America begins the movie in blue suit (as he's doing SHIELD's dirty work without realizing it), but when he decides to fight SHIELD in order to reclaim his own ideals, he grabs the World War II era suit in the Smithsonian, fighting his final battle in the good ole red, white, and blue.It's intelligently assembled, emotionally assured, and overall a very good time at the movies."
" Genuine thriller
",2019-11-24 00:00:00,9,"What many others have said, this is a real movie with a story and characters, plus first action action sequence direction. Wasn't sure what this would be like when I started streaming it to fill in some dead time, got halfway through before I needed to go to bed and actually WANTED to see the rest of the movie the next day. Good to see the under-used Redford in a recent role and Jenny Agutter too.Knocked one star off for the non-stop machine pistol stuff which I'm sure influences teens, but the movie stands by itself as an action movie."
" Not A Fan But Enjoyed
",2019-11-23 00:00:00,8,Yes it's all probably been seen before but I really enjoyed this one. Excellent action scenes. Ridiculous moments. I sit through these with my son and I was entertained. Not like Avengers end game which I found tedious.

",2019-11-18 00:00:00,8,"This year has been one of the best year's for Comic book adaptations because most of them was financially and as well as critically hailed by the audiences and critics. This is one of those films.
Captain America sequel makes the franchise more alive by creating an espionage thriller type film bringing mind meddling twists. One of the best action films of the year.Overall - 4/5"
" My top fav MCU movie that I've seen so far
",2019-11-10 00:00:00,10,"As the title of this review states (if the rating I gave it wasn't hint enough) I absolutely adore this addition to the MCU. Perfectly cast, top-notch acting and stellar script, The Winter Soldier takes the series a whole new direction. It is filled with intrigue and nothing is as it seems. There are so many twists and turns and to quote Rotten Tomato critics it's ""politically astute"". Awesome, awesome movie. Captain America is now my top favourite Avenger alongside Black Widow.
It's quite brutal and violent, but not overly graphic. It's themes are entertaining and the emotions hit hard, which along earns this movie a high rating.
I can't stress it enough - if you haven't yet seen this Marvel movie, then sit down and watch it!!! You won't regret it"
" Captain America the Winter Soldier
",2019-11-03 00:00:00,9,Captain America the Winter Soldier is an amazing sequel and one of the best movies in the MCU in my opinion. This film has a great villain and some of the action and fight scenes are the best in the MCU. This film is more serious and grittier the most MCU films. It feels like a political spy thriller mix with superheroes. The addition of Falcon in the MCU was great and black window was very good in the film. Overall it is a fantastic movie.9.3/10
" A very boring movie

" The best Comic Movie
",2019-10-27 00:00:00,10,"As far as what Marvel did in the first 10 years.... this for me was the best film. It was the most down to earth (comic wise) and relatable film of all. Don't get me wrong, I am a HUGE marvel fan and general have rated their movies high, (with the obvious exception of Captain Marvel) I liked this the best."
" Terrific action thriller
",2019-10-18 00:00:00,8,Rating8/10Excellent entertainer is a big step above the first Captain America movie. Terrific action scenes and tense political thriller plot combine together in this film making it one of my favourites in the Marvel pantheon.
" A Political Thriller and Superhero Movie Rolled Into One
",2019-10-08 00:00:00,10,"I enjoyed the first Captain America, but I wasn't ready for how truly brilliant this sequel would be. IMO this movie ranks as one of the greatest Marvel movies. It's definitely in the top three and may be my number one. It all comes down to the script.
Unlike most superhero flicks, the story does not involve chasing and stopping a shiny object in order to save the earth. Instead, we have a tightly written political thriller. This could have easily been a Tom Clancy novel that had Captain America written into it. The story has many brilliant twists. The action scenes are spectacular. The visual effects are close to perfect. You name it, and the movie nails it - acting, directing, music. Chris Evans is at his best in the lead role.
The movie also stands up to repeat viewings, which can be a rarity when they have some surprising twists. Even when you know what's coming, it's still a fantastic movie."
" More than a superhero movie.
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,9,"This is no average superhero film you expect, this is more of a spy thriller. Give props to the Russo brothers for making Captain America likeable for the MCU. This movie is where I place it with Spider-Man 2, X2, The Dark Knight, and Logan."

" Glad I've seen it
",2019-08-30 00:00:00,8,"When I started to watch Marvel movies, I thought it would be super action, super entertaining and super heroic. But as longer I watched all the movies, than longer I have started to think that superhero movies are not for me. Till ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", I considered the movies ""Hulk"" and ""Captain America: the first Avenger"" the only I have really loved, the otgers were just ""good"" and ""7 because I just liked the movie"". But this movie made me love it! The plot is enough for a superhero movie. The actors were great and believable, the ""Spy gear"" parts in the movie were all on their places. The twists were also enough. But this action! It was great. I have almost almost felt like every scene was a awesome combination of action, drama and dialogue. And the music! Usually I don't pay much attention to it, but the main theme was ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!
This movie is quite dark, and it suits well!
This movie deserves to be great, and get 8 out of 10."
" A great superhero movie
",2019-08-19 00:00:00,10,This movie could not have been executed better. Who knew two unsuccessful comedy directors could make such a great movie. This is just a nail biter super hero movie. One of marvels best. Great action movie.

" AN EXCELLENT CONSPIRACY THRILLER & THE BEST & MOST GROWN-UP IN THE MCU,BRILLIANT
",2019-08-11 00:00:00,8,"Captain America: The winter soldier is an excellent Conspiracy Thriller that felt so familiar to me, like a 90's Thriller like Enemy of the State (1998) or Murder at 1600 (1996) or The Fugitive (1993) you get the idea, it felt old school & that made it more grounded.
This is a much better film than the first film & is one of the best sequels ever, especially in the super hero genre!!!This Captain America movie is the best I've seen in the MCU by far & that's because of it's real,grittier & more grounded approach, there's brutal fighting & terrorist shootouts, this is a conspiracy Thriller with a touch of fantasy with it being a super hero Marvel film but even with that it's still a much darker & more mature toned Marvel flick.
Steve Rogers/Captain America is easily the best character of the Avengers & is the most interesting & most human, here he goes on an emotional journey & questions the government & powers that control everything.
This is an exciting & intriguing Action Thriller that also rings true with it's corruption & conspiracy storyline.Steve Rogers is lost, he feels alone in an ever changing world & he's basically a relic of a time when being a Hero ment something & he knew what he was fighting for but now everything seems corrupted & feels wrong, what is a true man of honour supposed to do in a world like this?The loneliness is in Cap's eyes & it's an excellent very human performance from Chris Evans, who is perfect at coming accross dis-heartened & hurt at what he sees around him.
Can he trust S.H.I.E.L.D?
Is he fighting on the right side?
Captain America is lost & unsure & that's the heart of this excellent film.
Captain America is definitely my favourite character of all the Avengers & in this action packed Thriller he cements that status.The always excellent Samuel l Jackson plays Nick Fury more serious here too & has some fantastic edge of the seat scenes.
Black Widow is excellent in this movie & show's she's one of the smartest & toughest Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D again another excellent & kick a## performance from Scarlett Johansson.
Anthony Mackie is also fantastic as Falcon, he's a good man with a good heart & you can totally see why Cap trusts him.
Caps old war buddy & best friend Bucky is a terrifying & deadly Assassin, again another excellent character & performance, he comes accross so deadly & fast like a Terminator!!!
We also have the great tough guy Frank Grillo & even movie legend Robert Redford rounding out the fantastic cast.If like me you get bored of massive explosions & buildings getting blown up & want a more intriguing & more grounded Marvel film then Captain America:The winter soldier is definitely the one.A truly fantastic,exciting & fast paced action-packed Conspiracy Thriller."
" Best Marvel Film Of The Saga
",2019-08-06 00:00:00,10,"I'm writing this 5 years later (after Avengers:Endgame) and I still stand with the same opinion as I had half a decade ago - this film is the best marvel has created. Chris Evan's Cap had one of the best character arcs through this sequel and his battle between his moral compass and the new world of government control is great. Samuel L Jackson was again great, and I loved Black Widows arc of redemption and dealing with the truth of HYDRA in what I think is Scarlett's best depiction of the character over all the other films. Finally, Stans acting was incredible. The winter soldier has so little lines but all his emotion and character is showed amazingly by facial and body expression. I have to say Sebastian's acting was best out of the great cast. The plot was thrilling, and I loved the sub plot of hydras infiltration which really adds to the characters' developments. An amazing film which maintains its thrill after dozens of rewatches."
" One of the best
",2019-08-04 00:00:00,9,Possibly one of the best movies in the MCU. Great story and great acting. Fantastic action scenes and great set up to the next film.
" The Dark Knight of the MCU
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,10,"Captain America Winter Soldier stars Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L Jackson, and Robert Redford. And it is the ninth movie in the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) and is directed by the Russo Brothers. In this installment Captain America is caught in the middle of a conspiracy involving S.H.I.E.L.D and a mysterious figure named the Winter Soldier. Now I think this is the best movie in the MCU that I believe is the Dark Knight of the MCU franchise. What makes this film surpass the other MCU movies is that the Russo Brothers decided to take espionage films like Three Days of the Condor and All the Presidents Men and make it their own Marvel movie. They even got Robert Redford who is the star of Three Days of the Condor and All the Presidents Men to star in this. This movie smells of 100% pure confidence as every department involved in making this went with gut instinct to create something beautiful. It's also not afraid to take any risks either as it just does and takes whatever it feels like without any consequences. It's so brilliant that it makes me want to pick up a comic book that involves Hydra, S.H.I.E.L.D, Armin Zola, to just about anything I can think of. So in conclusion this is the best MCU movie hands down that whenever I watch it I'll never get bored of it."
" Excellent: 9.5
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,9,"I was not the biggest fan of the first Captain America film. It looked great, and featured some fine acting, but it lacked some of the energy that had characterized Marvel movies up to that point. Cap's second standalone film improves in almost every way. When there isn't action there's suspense, both of which are managed very efficiently. Though it's hard to talk about this movie without spoiling the plot, it can and must be said that it's hard for me to imagine any of Marvel's Phase 2 films having this much of an impact on the canon. Rather than being a straight-up actioner like its predecessors, The Winter Soldier is a successfully hybridized action-thriller, with mysteries and cold stares abound. All this adds up to what is arguably the best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, possibly even beating The Avengers or Iron Man. Guardians of the Galaxy, along with every other MCU film between now and 2015, has some mighty big shoes to fill."
" A must see
",2019-07-26 00:00:00,10,arguably one of the best marvel filmsamazingly paced action and spy thrillerbuilds on cap and widow's tight knit friendshipintro to falcon and winter soldier is excellently done
" Soooo gooood!
",2019-07-17 00:00:00,8,The Winter Soldier is a great Captain America movie. Who knew that Cap and Black Widow would make such a good them. Love their suits in this movie. Falcon is a great addition with Cap and Widow. The Winter Soldier and Alexander Pierce are great villains. And to none comic book fans the Bucky/Winter Soldier twist was good. Also as always Nick Fury was great. All action scenes in the movie are beyond AWESOME.
" coherent story, a real superhero
",2019-07-17 00:00:00,9,"An important matter about a superhero is that he/she must compel the viewer to believe his/her. The most important thing is not, necessarily, his power. Perhaps Captain America is not the strongest one, but I am sure he is the most reliable one. another matter that attract me is that, sometimes, I think an actor helps the character and sometimes vice versa but in this case, the character and actor both helped each other. Of course, the balance is a little for the strong character of Captain America.
and finally, if i were a superhero i prefer it was Captain America because it is supported by a nation."
" Amazing thriller
",2019-07-12 00:00:00,8,This movie is a superb mcu movie! The action is great and the characters are entertaining and the visuals are spectacular! A must see!
" Before we get started, does anyone want to get out ?
",2019-07-11 00:00:00,9,"""Whereas 'The First Avenger' was a friendly route to introduce Captain Steve Rogers and his fellow comrades, 'The Winter Soldier' ventures to highly improve these attributes, making not only the film great as a standalone but, it also delivers some of the best flicks of the MCU""First and foremost, what glows about Captain America is not either his strength or his badass movements but, his desires of helping others and stepping in at the front of the most vulnerable ones. Probably, in the MCU, there is no such person as him. These qualities are truthfully shown in the first instalment, which even though it is not their best result, the audience catches the idea and aspirations of humble Steve Rogers. Therefore, the sequel dwells on Steve's past and collides with his present, ending up being heartening because most of the viewers will recall what Cap has been through. The most valuable element about the film is that he is not alone, at the contrary, he is facing the Winter Soldier and S.H.I.E.L.D with Nick Fury, Black Widow and the newest superhero Falcon. This is a glorious adventure for the MCU due to the implication of a massive research organization and the danger it could provoke throughout the world. Moreover, they establish the Age of Ultron by judging Avengers implication with S.H.I.E.L.D and clearly, these problems will lead us all to the Civil War, therefore, it masterly shadows a crucial chapter in the franchise.In spite of having outstanding action pieces, an impressive cast and an intriguing plot, it still has some flaws. To begin with, some characters as Alexander Pierce are barely mentioned during the film, making it difficult to fully comprehend their importance, thus, there are some unrealistic action moments, let's be honest, this is a science-fiction film where almost nothing is real, though, you can spot something beyond unbelievable like a little guy destroying an ultimate-technology plane or professional-well-decoded fake masks like the one Natasha wore... These are just scarce facts, people ... Still Bucky and Cap's relationship are the cutest of the whole MCU ... (83/100)"
" Unbelievably Astonishing
",2019-07-02 00:00:00,10,If this isn't a top tier movie for you. You have a serious problem.Easily the best action sequences out of the whole MCU and that is saying a lot since there's been 11 years of marvel.The entirety of the cast is amazing and you can see their chemistry throughout the movie and off set.
" WINTY!!!!
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,8,"Super amazing. packed with awesome action, lots of it traditional, spy-style action, not just superhero stuff. good story with cool characters. changed my view of captain America from a lamo to a beast . One big downside was Robert Redford's bland performance. lots of memorable moments and great scenes. Great cast of characters coming together in an avenger-like collaboration. and the music is among the best in the MCU, as is the action (7 viewings, 4/24/2020)
SPOILERS
I think this movie had one of the most perfect endings. the way they solved the issue with the 3 cartridges, the final battle between captain america and the winter soldier, and his last line to bucky after refusing to fight him because he is his friend: I'm with you til the end of the line. Also, not really part of the movie but might be the most hyped i've been from a post credits scene, teasing the next cap movie."
" Mixed
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,6,"This big-budget epic has the title superhero and his peers trying to fight off an enemy spy agency that is working within a broader international spy agency based in Washington D.C. One of its agents is known as The Winter Soldier.Like many other big-budget films, this one does a superb job in the technical aspects particularly the aerial camera work and the special effects. However, like many other modern big-budget films, the technical effects have taken over to make up for a screenplay that is too busy and sometimes difficult to follow. Even the battle scenes seem too busy at times.While film-making has become more sophisticated since computer-generated imagery, one still yearns for a better balance in action scenes like those from older films. The special effects were less sophisticated than today but they did much better with the ""less is more"" principle where story was concerned. - dbamateurcritic"
" One of the best superhero movies of all time
",2019-06-27 00:00:00,10,A perfect spy/political thriller as a superhero movie. The plot is one the best ever conceived. Perfectly crafted characters by putting them each in situations that challenge their biggest character flaw. Exciting all the way to the end. Also has a lot to say when t comes to the security vs. freedom debate.
" A Grey, Bland, Dud. In Other Words, ""An Exemplary MCU Masterpiece""
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,3,"MCU fans will tell you, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is great. Better than great. The internet is clogged with reviews from endless Youtube pseudo-critics and Marvel shills whose entire cinematic knowledge stems from Breaking Bad and The Dark Knight, calling The Winter Soldier a game-changing masterwork. It is not. It's every bit as dull and uninteresting as every other ephemeral episode of The Marvel Cinematic Money-printing Machine. And it's aggressive mediocrity is yet another piece of evidence in my continuing theory on MCU apologists; they're idiots.That's harsh, I know. Some fans out there are perfectly content admitting that a movie like The Winter Soldier offers only disposable pulp thrills. However, it's the people claiming The Winter Soldier as 'innovative', or 'revolutionary' that really irk me. The chief reason given by these idiots is that Captain America: Winter Soldier is a superhero movie that is also a ""70s political espionage thriller"". Let's break it down. Yes, Captain America 2 contains elements of political espionage. The storyline involves two political organizations, S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra, a covert assassin (The Winter Soldier, Sebastian Stan), and Robert Redford (He's from the 70s). This is called window dressing. Surface decorations that evoke the feeling of a conspiracy thriller. What The Winter Soldier does not have is the actual structure of a political thriller. It's an efficiently made, TV-style superhero flick. The good guys punch the bad guys, the cars crash into each other, and the big CGI heli-carriers crumble like peanut brittle.There's nothing wrong with a superhero movie that only does these things. A schlocky action movie can be very enjoyable on that basic level, but only if the film embraces its core identity. When a movie like this fails, it does so because it wastes energy trying to be something else. Captain America: The Winter Soldier pretends to deal with issues. It pretends to be about real figures. But it's pretend. S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra are made-up, and as much as directors Anthony and Joseph Russo want you to recognize these things as analogous to our real institutions, you can't when it's all connected to a silly comic book world where a guy named Falcon flies around blasting machine guns at faceless goons.The cost of this focus on being a half-prestige picture is that nothing is allowed to go over the top. Want more proof that this film's champions are idiots? Look at the fight scenes that they praise as masterclasses in filmmaking. A fist fight in an elevator. Revolutionary! Look at those punches and kicks! It's unlike any other film I've ever seen! A fist fight on a highway. Brilliant! Hand to hand combat! Never before has a hero used his fist to punch another man! #Masterpiece! I can't be living on the same planet as these people. The action in Captain America 2 is not only not revolutionary (That is extremely obvious), it's flat-out bad. Hand to hand fist fights are usually boring by nature. It takes a real master of film craft to overcome the blandness inherent in such a scene. Cameron can do it, Raimi can do it, The Russo Brothers can't come close. There is absolutely no sense of invention in the action. No passion. No ideas at all. Just punches, filmed with detached digital murkiness.I can't think of a better way to describe Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The whole thing is detached. It's a filler TV episode. Efficiently produced, with the façade of something meaningful, but completely uninterested in personality, life, or genuine fun/excitement/thrills. It's boring, transient garbage that managed to fool stupid people into thinking it was great. Well idiots, you get what you deserve.31/100"
" One of the best movies in the MCU!
",2019-06-19 00:00:00,10,"Captain America The Winter Soldier is a fantastic MCU film and a fantastic film in general. I love how the Russo brothers made this movie a dark and gritty political thriller. The story is amazing, the characters are well written, and the winter soldier is one of the great conflicted types of villains. The fighting choreography is flawless, and this film can really tug on your heartstrings at times as well. The Winter soldier is one of the best movies in the MCU!"
" Winter Soldier is the best movie in the Avengers series to date
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,9,"Winter Soldier is the best movie in the Avengers series to date. Breathtaking visuals mixed with a solid storyline, energetic action sequences and they finally make a true superhero out of Captain America. On a whole it follows on nicely from both The First Avenger and Assemble. It also benefitted from the attendance of Black Widow, and also an excellent villain. The action was superb from start to finish, Captain America himself has a venerability about him with a human nature. Its just thrilling, edge of the seat stuff which puts a real punch back into the Marvels best running series to date."
" Solid action movie , great superhero, fantastic spy movie
",2019-06-13 00:00:00,9,"Winter: soldier is an enthralling entry to the marvel universe, alongside gotg 2014 was one of the best years for marvel. Personally I prefer this film to gotg , some of the action scenes (before the third act) are portrayed in such a realistic way, even though you know they're fake and that when you think about them that they're unrealistic they still have a huge impact and still surprise me"
" The Bourne Captain America
",2019-06-12 00:00:00,8,"Captain America the Winter Soldier is definitely one could the say the spiciest of the marvel films so far. Full of huge plot twists and turns changing the game. The captain America storyline sure is showing it might be the most important over any other avenger. Amazing action sequences and set pieces. Very slick. Nick fury is a major highlight, fleshing his character and the movie really makes you root for him. Showing his badassery. Imagine the first captain America mixed with the entire Bourne trilogy. That's The Winter Soldier. If that doesn't sell you I dont know what will. 81%"
" Russos's upgraded the Game!
",2019-06-11 00:00:00,9,"May Captain America won't be this much successful franchise without russos they're too good at it.
They had perfect sense of bringing logic to the comic."
" ""Cpt. USA: The Winter Soldier"" is the MCU's absolute best
",2019-06-06 00:00:00,10,"I had skepticism over these being the same writers as ""Thor"" Dark World"".. My mind was pleasantly set at ease upon the 1st 15min of viewing.. Marcus & McFeely are in their toppest form and IMO have peaked as writers with ""The Winter Soldier"", paralled only by ""IW"".
The Russos are also at the top of their directing game, with visuals that would please even the utmost demanding.. Without a doubt MCU's very best film, and also thoroughly an all genere cinematic classic to stand the test of time."
" Ingenious, thrilling, action packed
",2019-06-03 00:00:00,10,"An old-school espionage thriller hiding in a superhero movie. The casting of Three Days of the Condor star Robert Redford, is no coincidence. Imagine a superhero from the era when everything was black and white, good was good, evil was evil. Alas, he is now living in a time when things are not as clear, and he becomes more paranoid as the list of people he can trust starts to shrink.It took me several years for me to review this movie to see if it was going to age as well as I thought, and it has aged even better. The elevator scene that had me at the edge of my seat in a movie theater in 2014, is now iconic. I expect this movie to be referenced in the future the same way we now reference classics like Die Hard."

It took me several years for me to review this movie to see if it was going to age as well as I thought, and it has aged even better. The first movie established a hero of the past, idealistic, where the lines of good vs evil were clearly defined. This movie sets the hero in a present where those lines blur, and the more you find out, the less you can trust the motives of the people surrounding you. Captain America is indeed, living in a time where the forces his generation fought in Europe and the Pacific are now controlling the highest levels of power, openly and in secret.The elevator scene that had me at the edge of my seat in a movie theater in 2014, is now iconic.

",2019-05-27 00:00:00,8,"Captain America: Winter SoldierA much better showing from the patriotic hero here...the action scenes are far superior to its predecessor l, and the whole storyline which incorporates shield more is like a giant door swinging open in the Marvel series. The masterful Samuel L Jackson is as cool as he ever is whilst maintaining a slight narcissistic yet clever image.The introduction of some bird man (I still have no idea who that is) is a good concept and adds a needed sidekick to Captain America...and the elevator scene really shows for the first time that Cap can actually be a hard man!The only thing that lets this film down for me is the idea of the winter soldier being an old friend. I get what the makers are trying to do there, but the ending needed...well the ending needed the end! The fact that he has been left alive tells me that there is more to come from this villainous man, when really he should be dead and buried!

" i was wrong Iris
",2019-05-26 00:00:00,6,"Movie afternoon with Gertie.I must admit i'd always dismissed and dissed Captain US. However i've come round to him. He's witty, has an emotional arch, and is more than just a shield.So to it's credit CATWS does have a narrative. Like with Superman and Clark Kent, the most distinctive parts of this sequel aren't the action but the moments of character and plot: the Steve Rogers bits rather than the Captain America ones."
" Great action, slow in between.
",2019-05-26 00:00:00,8,"A little slow in the non-action sequences, but the task of tying this film to its predecessor was quite well done, even if it had a very heavy ""Minority Report"" flavor to it.
Also, kudos to Marvel for integrating these plot elements with their ""Agents of SHIELD"" show."
" Captain Awesome

" Waited 5 years to watch lol!
",2019-05-23 00:00:00,9,"First things first. Captain America was not one of my Avengers to watch. But, after watching Endgame my opinion greatly changed. This movie, shows grit, action and great screen writing. There are no flaws in this plot. American hero, with amazing ethics and ...integrity. Robert Redford character floored me; people, certain people are watched monitored and are eliminated to have a better controlled society ...Hydra. abd an ex Hydra scientist downloaded his consciousness to assist in the black op government. Captain confronting Nick Fury and finally meeting his childhood friend who was now a Hydra agent. The battle was done well in this movie. And the new friendships emerged. Greatly enjoyed this movie and highly recommend it as part of the Avenger collection ."
" Marvel's first masterpiece
",2019-05-21 00:00:00,10,"After letting Avengers age a few years, I no longer can see it as the masterpiece I did, even if it remains a fine film. However, Winter Soldier continues to be my favorite Marvel film even after five years. This film is masterful in how it vastly improves the characterizations of Steve Rogers, Black Widow, Nick Fury, and other characters. It also introduces some truly terrifying villains, excellent twists, great character moments, and witty, smart dialogue. The fight choreography also remains the finest in any Marvel film with one duel that rivals films like Ip Man and the Raid 2. And I stand by that opinion. I really want to gush about how much it made me love the Winter Soldier and become an even bigger fan of Black Widow, but you can see that for yourself. I will close this review off by saying that this film's grounded story does it huge favors as it explores topical subjects of politics and freedom, relevant to our political climate. This is not just a great Marvel film, it's a great film in general. And for that, I believe it remains the strongest of Marvel's films."
" Superb Action Film!
",2019-05-18 00:00:00,9,"Besides being a terrific sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger, Winter Soldier is just an absolutely pulsatingly exciting action film. The set pieces from the initial night raid on the boat through to the arguably somewhat over the top carrier v carrier ending, are just brilliantly rendered and all so varied.I love the way the Captain's story has progressed along with that of Black Widow. It makes sense that they would be thrown together in this film as neither has any sort of regular family. The introduction of Falcon was welcome and focusing quite a large element of the story around Nick Fury, also added depth to his character, whilst throwing a light on Shield operations past and present. At the same time, introducing the Winter Soldier into the mix added what is almost a touch of Shakespearian tragedy to a super-hero espionage film.For me, Captain America is the most interesting of the Avengers.We see him adjusting and adapting to life after a 70 year jump, whilst simaltaneously missing a life time of companionship with hs one true love Peggy Carter. It all serves to accentuate his humanity, which we see again when he continually questions the actions and ethics of those with whom he continuously has to deal.This is everything a big budget super hero film should be. Great job Russo Brothers!"

And the guy is like 80 and still has blond hair? Really? He's shrivelled like a prune Please retire.Do you need the money?Oh and the other bad plastic surgery guy is Gary Shandlin. I take it he was looking to be taken seriously and that's why he made this movie, but the result is just the opposite.The movie is typical fair for the suoer hero genre. Lots of loud shooting that desensitizes kids to violence, but no one can blame Hollywood on the school shootings because they are in bed with the Dems, just like the left media is."
" One of the better MCU entries, but still flawed
",2019-05-06 00:00:00,7,"The Good: Captain America: The Winter Soldier features a good story, it's fittingly dramatic and more intense. The scenery is great, the CGI is good. The fight scenes are tense. and Occasionally there's a good joke.The Bad: Scarlett Johansson is awkward in this one, she's unneeded, not to mention there's this weird, sort of romance, but no chemistry. She's bad.
Also some the villains' goons are irritatingly dumb.Overall The Winter Soldier is good, better then the past few MCU entries. But it still has it's issues."
" The Greatest MCU Film Ever Made!
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,10,"Winter Soldier is arguably the best ever to come out from the Russo brothers. Every part of the film was action packed. The tempo, cinematography, the acting by Chris Evans, Sebastian Stan and company is just spot on. You would be wanting to watch it again. Story was concise, didn't waste too much time and again the entirety of the movie is just breathtaking especially that this movie came out in 2014. In my opinion there's nothing that's going to top this movie. At least I hope so.""The price of freedom is high, always has been. But it's the price I'm willing to pay."" - Captain America/Steve Rogers"
" My Favourite Captain America Movie
",2019-05-04 00:00:00,9,"I say this is my favourite because it is so well-written and produced that I can't find any flaws in it. They knew what they were doing when they casted Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes because he's phenomenal as The Winter Soldier.He doesn't even speak a full 2 sentences in the entire movie and yet, he's the one that makes this movie work. His eyes are hauntingly beautiful and the way he carries himself as the the programmed Winter Soldier who is at war with the man who was Steve Roger's best friend, Bucky Barnes is nothing short of an Oscar nomination. He's one of the best actors in the industry right now.I rewatch this movie once every few months because it really is THAT good."
" This is, without a doubt, one of the best superhero films of all time.
",2019-05-03 00:00:00,10,"After being blown away with ""The Avengers"" (2012), I was looking forward to what they had in store next. Enter ""Iron Man 3"" (2013), an average movie, but not nearly as enjoyable as the Marvel films before it. After that, came the travesty; ""Thor: The Dark World"" (2013), a movie even worse than ""Iron Man 3""! I thought: ""what's happening? How is this possible?!"" Then came ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014), directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. At first, I was a bit hesitant to see it after the substandard movies ""Iron Man 3"" and ""Thor: The Dark World"". But then I thought: ""third times the charm, and it's Marvel. They deserve one more chance."" When I went to see it, I was the only one in the theater. I'm like: ""okay, this isn't a good sign!"" But thankfully, I was 100% wrong. This movie had me on the edge of my seat the whole time! Perfect story, perfect acting, perfect soundtrack, perfect sets/locations, and of course perfect special effects! ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is another example of what I classify as a perfect movie. Not just the best Marvel Cinematic Universe film, but the best overall Marvel film, and tied with ""Superman"" (1978) as my favorite superhero movie and one of my top 10 all-time favorite films! When Marvel studios found the Russo Brothers, they struck gold. The Russo Brothers literally saved the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with this movie. This movie definitely redeemed my love for this franchise! It's one of the fastest two hours you'll ever experience watching a movie. You blink, and it'll be over! It was fun being the only person in the theater, that gave the movie a whole different viewing experience. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", what are you waiting for? Go see it, I promise that you won't regret it! The movie is honestly that good, and well worth investing your time in. See it if you haven't already!"

",2019-04-28 00:00:00,9,"This movie accomplishes exactly what Iron Man 3 does but for Steve Rogers instead. Unlike Thor in Thor: The Dark World, this movie is filled with Steve's character development. Not only does he find his long lost best friend but he also struggles in coming to terms with himself and attempting to fit into a new society. He also must learn to trust certain people but not everyone, this only furthers the bond between Natasha and Steve. This is also his second run in with disobeying large authority figures and going against them for not only himself, but also the good of the people."
" Absolutely Amazing!
",2019-04-27 00:00:00,10,"This is my favorite marvel movie so far, It's so fun and entertaining, There's always something to enjoy and there are a lot of plot twists that keep you on the edge of your seat. The introduction to Falcon couldn't have been more perfect. The use of Hydra really makes this movie even better, There are constant jokes and uses of great humor, The way they presented Bucky was so emotional yet so surprising, best one yet"
" the worst movie from marvel, boring, bad script, not smart plot, flat characters
",2019-04-24 00:00:00,1,"Thor Ragnarok is on my top 3 of best movies of marvel, cause it was epic, smart, fascinating, mystique, magical, esoteric, surprising, funny, even horrorific(hela scared me a little bit), and that's cinema, a visual travel that can cause you emotions, but this film is totally the opposite, not epic, plot we've seen millions of times in other movies, boring, nothing magical or mystical, totally predictable, I felt sleep 2 times trying to end of watching it, but it was a TORTURE!! Im used to complex plots, smart scripts, fascinating dialogues, philosophical characters, this film didnt have any of this, the rank in this film is so unffair, this definitely cant superpass a 4, the acting and producting is legit, but the movie itself is just so bad I can't give it more than 1, sorry :/ Im a marvel fan anyway :)"
" Best film
",2019-04-22 00:00:00,10,It's a fantastic film my best and favourite MCU ever
" Still the best Marvel movie made, ""The Dark Knight"" of Marvel
",2019-04-17 00:00:00,10,"I hadn't seen this movie in a while, probably since Civil War came out and I forgot how amazing this movie. The Russo brothers crafted a tight script and made one of the best spy-thrillers probably since Casino Royale or the good Bourne movies.This has everything you could ever want from a Marvel movie. Superb action, so well choreographed and fully realized. The story is dripping with mystery and feels exactly like a spy drama, but with the added Marvel flair for action. It vastly improves on Black Widow's character as she wasn't fully realized yet in IM3 or Avengers, but also add a Falcon that is realistic and not in red & white spandex.The cinematography in this one is stellar and easily the best in the MCU. It just feels so different from any of the others. It matches the spy drama with cool blues and greys. This is probably the only MCU movie of them all that I could see being in my top 10 movies of all time. For the most part I enjoy them all. Some more than others, some are just pure entertainment and fun to enjoy, but The Winter Soldier is something above that and on whole new level.It'd probably be overkill to compare this as ""The Dark Knight"" of the MCU, but it's pretty damn close. It's almost TDK with CGI action and over the top set pieces, rather than the stellar practical effects and solid action sequences. It's like a more comic-esque version of TDK.Everything about this movie just feels so goddamn great. I like it a little better than Civil War overall, but this and Civil War are pretty much the perfect Marvel movies. Civil War expands on The Winter Soldier and incorporates Bucky into the story so well that even comic diehards probably don't care that it doesn't follow the comic book story. The Russo's have made the best three Marvel movie in the MCU and it's gonna be hard for anyone to top them. Here's hoping Endgame continues their perfect streak in the MCU."
" Almost perfect.
",2019-04-12 00:00:00,9,"I have little to say. From start to finish, I enjoy the entirety of this movie. It's compared with James Bond and Mission Impossible, two franchises I never cared about, and makes me want to watch them.I wouldn't say it's perfect because they shouldn't have made Hydra that important of a part. They should've owned the fact that America is as dangerous as other countries for them to have that developed weapon. Not just because ""we might get infiltrated by bad people, but we are good"", but because America it is dangerous, period.That fact muddles the message that Captain America learns (don't follow institutions, even Americans ones) and puts the blame exclusively ""on the dangerous others"", but still, Steve Rogers' arc keeps developing in coherent ways (something can't be said for all the others)."
" The MCU (So Far) Ranked: #1
",2019-04-10 00:00:00,9,"The Russo brothers came out swinging.Captain America: The Winter Soldier is an entertaining, tightly directed, brilliantly acted, fast paced and well edited action film that just so happens to be a squeal to the First Avenger. Many of the best moments in the franchise are in this film including the elevator scene and the fight on the bridge, this film also has great character interactions especially with Steve Rodgers and Nick Fury. This feels like an update on classic James Bond stories with a modern edge, this is everything that a comic book movie could be and I highly recommend checking it out again if you haven't seen it in a while. There is no question that The Winter Soldier is the best of the MCU."

",2019-04-05 00:00:00,6,"I don't have many notes on this, marvel is pretty much all the same and I kind of lost interest when they brought back Sam Jackson. I was shocked and pleasantly surprised when he died. In this end everything was predictable and the fights were just average."
" One of the smarter and more entertaining Marvel movies of the era.

" Review: Captain America: The Winter Soldier
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,5,"First, the sequel to our American cap is just one thing.
Questionable.
Apart from having a heavy and slow pace, and having an antagonist out of nowhere, Captain America, the Winter Soldier lacks the narrative established in the first film of the CAP, the script is mediocre, I mean, if they were going to make the cap doing winter acrobatics of the Macho hard hit, minimal would have done something more or less similar to Iron Man 2, but there is nothing here.
The CGI while it's good, well, the characters and the script stop to want, likewise, the sequences where buildings are destroyed (for example, in the Falcon scene) is re forced and nothing exciting, the final battle of Cap and Bucky does not have the taste of fresh air as It was with the Red Skull, nor if Bucky is explored well, it feels forced that only why your friend in quotes abandoned you because of you is very foolish, or if you have a good background to make the character interesting, the action sequence is still had Endo the CGI, the narrative blur of the characters, and the script, leaves the movie very bad, not counting that is boring both objectively and personally, there is almost nothing interesting, the final battle is not exciting and less interesting than with the Red Skull with the first, the script is badly exploited knowing, that the sequels of Marvel are between good and decent, is boring and, no matter how much CGI has the movie (whether it is good or bad) if you do not have a good script and a good narrative of the per Characters, will be very bad, but unlike other sequels, this came out mediocre. 2.5/5."
" Hold onto your buts this film was a mouthful!
",2019-03-29 00:00:00,8,"When I first say this film I didn't really understand it, I basicly found it boring, but after watching it again after remembering that S.H.I.E.L.D fell I wanted a re-cap on what happened and I loved it. It had such a good story line. Again a definite have to watch not just to know what happened but for some action, fun and to see another fun Captain America & Black Widow fim."
" The Best Superhero Movie since The Dark Knight
",2019-03-23 00:00:00,10,"Like TDK, this was not just a superhero movie. That movie was a crime drama,and this movie was a conspiracy thriller. It reminded me of classic espionage films like 3 days of the Condor.The Russo brothers made one of the best action movies in the recent memory. They also made changes to Cap while keeping his roots intact, thus making him morally upright but infinitely cooler.5 out of 5 stars for me."
" This feels like a DCEU movie...
",2019-03-22 00:00:00,4,"This movie went on forever, it had absolutely no humor, and it's just impossibly forgettable. Plus Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver were promoted half to death so it was disappointing to see them for about five seconds."
" One of my favorite MCU films
",2019-03-20 00:00:00,9,"I saw this in theaters and I loved it then, my love for it has only increased. It's one of the best marvel movies and has some of the best acting and writing"
" More than an action movie.
",2019-03-18 00:00:00,8,"Great movie. This has a strong and complex plot - S.H.I.E.L.D / Hydra. Nice meld with TV series. Great cast with great performances. Great relationships and character development. Nice backstories for the new additions. Great villains, Robert Redford in an unusual role, but always a solid choice, and the twist with the Winter Soldier, although a bit predictable, mined the heart of the story. Even on a rewatch, I give this film an 8 (great) out of 10. {Superhero Action Adventure}"
" Great Action Movie!
",2019-03-17 00:00:00,7,"Captain America is great again. However, the title is wrong as winter soldier appears only very little and Sebastian Stan was the worst choice for this role!"
" More spy movie than superhero movie
",2019-03-14 00:00:00,10,"One of the greatest comic book movies of all time. I love everything about it, from the action to just the basic story, it's all great. I think this was really the film that launched the modern MCU with the way it was written. I honestly think that the MCU wouldn't be what it is today without the Russo Brothers. They have directed 3 of my favorite MCU movies, including my favorite movie of all time. All in all, an amazing spy movie with some superhero elements within."
" Best Captain America ever made!!!
",2019-03-12 00:00:00,10,"Went back to watch this film after seeing Captain Marvel which I thought kicked ass. The first Iron Man I went back to watch too which still holds up very well. However, Winter Soldier is the best! Great story, great characters, and without a doubt the best super hero action ever put on screen. I loved the darker path they took after MCU's phase 1 where Steve Roger's after coming out of the ice, and the alien battle in New York, he's still trying to get used to modern society and must protect everyone in danger. Black Widow is amazing and very sexy. No one can ever replace her cause she completely nails it. All in all, it's a 10 out of 10. Greatest Captain America of the 3"
" A Thrilling and Surprisingly Complex Movie, with the Best Action Marvel has ever put to Screen!
",2019-03-09 00:00:00,9,"This was one of the movies that actually started my love for the medium as a whole: back in 2014, it was the most thrilling cinema experience I had thus far, and it still stands as one, if not the best action movies I have ever seen. Marvel can be truly proud of this!Acting:
Chris Evans in his third outing of Cap is perhaps his most subtle and mature performance yet. He plays the part of a disillusioned, somewhat broken yet optimistic and kind warrior, and he does it brilliantly. It is by no means award-worthy, but it shows how much Evans has grown as an actor the last few years.Scarlett Johansson plays a very different Black Widow since Avengers and Iron Man 2, and goes for a more playful and sexy personality, while still maintaining the badassery and cold-blooded killer attitude that she was introduced with. It is very effective, and she gets a vulnerability that is fresh and interesting. She plays really well opposite Chris, and I would've liked to see this performance a bit more in sequels.Sam L. Jackson is back as Nick Fury, and while his role has always been fairly simple as the brooding and stoic super-spy, he gets a lot more character and personality here that I really dig. In addition, he is getting his own action sequences to carry as well, equally impressive. Samuel is never doing a bad job of course, and I give him high praise everytime.Sebastian Stan:
Going into SPOILER territory here:Sebastian is the Winter Soldier.For a guy who hasn't had much big films on his resume yet, Stan does a terrific job as the silent and deadly, yet broken, Winter Soldier. He had to do a lot of physical demanding stuff in here as, well as show some heavy and subtle emotion, and he pulls it all off.Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce is clearly one of the lesser characters. Redford is a veteran, actor and gives a realistic and strong performance as the layered bureaucrat. The character however, isn't that interesting in the end, and can quickly be forgotten.Anthony Mackie as Falcon is a nice addition to the MCU as the grounded soldier guy who has a good heart and a strong sense of duty and loyalty like Steve Rogers. The two play well against each other, and Mackie delivers in both the calm subtle scenes and the tense action sequences. Can't wait to see more of him.Emily Vancamp and Frank Grillo are compelling side characters as Sharon Carter and Brock Rumlow, the first one being a kind and realistic love-interest/badass, and the second one being a likable and also brutal brawler. Both actors are giving grounded and well-acted performances.Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill is also a bit of a surprise, given the fact that her role is quite small. She still pulls off a compelling and subtle performance that adds a lot to the small character that Smulders plays.Direction:
For merely having directed ""Office"" episodes, it is astonishing how well the Russo brothers have handled the transition to big action blockbuster, their first big movie being the best of the whole MCU. They handle pretty much every aspect of it as if they have done it for years, ranging from subtle emotional scenes to cgi-heavy brutal action scenes and comedic stuff. This is a golden pick from Feige if there ever was one.Cinematography:
While the MCU movies have been critisized for their lack of compelling camerawork, i think that ""grey"" style fits this movie really well. Trent Opaloch utilizes a surprising amount of interesting camera positions and lets certain shots linger just long enough to speak to you from an emotional level. That is quality shooting. The action sequences are pretty much perfect in terms of camerawork, with exactly the right balance of shaky-cam and quick cutting.Plot:
This is not your typical superhero movie, and perhaps that is what makes it work so well. It is a political spy thriller, with a superhero touch. Its themes are surprisingly relevant, and full of character and subtle emotional touches that still make heavy impact. The pacing is just right, and there is a great balance between EPIC action and story progression with character development.Music:
Again a great surprise from Marvel, who have again been critisized for their forgettable scores. Henry Jackman delivers a thrilling and exhilarating score, while at the same time leaving room for the emotional calm tunes that are necessary. Not everything is as memorable or fun to listen to, but it is really impressive work.Editing:
The style in which this movie is cut together, is surprisingly subtle and effective for a blockbuster movie. You feel the impact of each transition to a different segment of the story, and the action is just well enough cut together that you can still tell what's happening while at the same time experiencing a break-neck pace.Production Design:
Nothing really interesting to mention here: mostly offices and modern buildings, with a slick and clean style, but not really elaborate. The same goes for costumes and make-up: efficiency over style. Maybe that's exactly what they where going for, and it works for the most part.Sound:
High-quality work here, ranging from startling gun shots and heavy explosions, to screeching cartires and crashing vehicles. Some of the best sound Marvel has given us since Iron Man.VFX:
This movie got an Academy Award nomination for this, and I can see why. Not since Avengers has there been such a great blend between the real environment and digital, particulary in the action sequences.Tone:
Until Infinity War, I would call this the darkest movie the MCU has brought out. Perhaps because it is so realistic at the same time. There is a lot of humanity to be found in here, and it ends in a way that may even leave a few tears. There is still room for comedy however, and that works equally great because of the pitch-perfect cast. The action sequences are staged in a way that adds a LOT of adrenalin to it, and when they eventually finish, you are still feeling the weight of every epic thing that you just witnessed.Overall Concensus:
This is my favorite MCU movie, even next to Infinity War and Black Panther. Aside from feeling like a comic-book movie with a bit of goofiness, it does pretty much everything right or achieves what it wants to go for. Not to mention that it is absolutely spectacular in terms of entertainment value. 9.0/10"
" The very best film in the MCU
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,10,"What makes this film stand out from every single other one in the franchise is it's commitment to telling a fleshed out spy-thriller story that just happens to star Captain America.The action sequences really pack the thrills and highlights include great chase sequences, an excellently done infiltration sequence, and several fist fights that leave you wanting more. Some of them lean a bit too hard on shaky cam and quick editing, but the choreography and intent is absolutely there.To be honest, I actually skipped this one in theaters due to how middle of the road the first Captain America was, but was so pleasantly surprised when I decided to give this one a shot at a rental many years later. I of course bought the Blu Ray as well, as I felt compelled to own it.I'm also a huge fan of Civil War, but I think this one edges it out in being the best film in the MCU because of that fact that it works perfectly fine in a vacuum. Civil War is pretty much a mini Avengers that is a culmination of all the preceding films before it. This one can pretty much stand on it's own and doesn't lean as heavily as Civil War does in the spectacle of the heroes powers."
" Better than the first
",2019-02-08 00:00:00,7,The first film set the scene and this one really went full steam ahead. A really good addition to the franchise
" Phenomenal action movie!!!
",2019-02-07 00:00:00,9,"This is less of a comic book movie, more of a crime thriller! Anthony and Joe Russo make their Marvel debut and take the MCU in a gritty, more realistic direction. This fast paced action film has a fantastic, gripping plot with high stakes, a great cast and simply phenomenally choreograped action sequences. Also, we're introduced to the most badass Marvel villain ever. The immensely terrifying and immensely cool, Winter soldier. Sebastian Stan does a great job at bringing this comic book legend to life. In this movie, we get a lot more character and relationship development with Captain America and Black Widow. Samuel L Jackson also gives a great performance and portrays a more vulnerable, broken and human side to Nick Fury. This film also has great comedic moments which are helped/produced by the introduction of Sam Wilson/Falcon. There is not much this film doesn't do!!!!Simply phenomenal!!One of the best movies in the MCU!!!"

",2019-02-02 00:00:00,9,"I loved this movie! It features a good continuity in the storyline as Captain America (with a brilliant performance by Chris Evans) battles a new enemy with a character from his past. My favorite scenes were the battle scenes, the chase scenes, and the elevator scene. This movie does not disappoint, and the interactions between the main characters are first rate. A must for any superhero or Marvel Comic movie fan.*** out of ****"
" Best Marvel movie

" Among the best.
",2019-01-16 00:00:00,8,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier is probably in the TOP 3 MCU movies, especially in the last few years. It shines bright with all of the characters involved, the chemistry between Rogers and Natasha, the involvment than Nick Fury had in the movie, the villain that is the Winter Soldier, Falcon was also awesome and pretty much involved throughout the whole movie. The return of Hydra was something I did not expect since I am not a fan of the comics and I don't know what to expect, but man, was the think with that Zola AI cool as hell. I wonder what would it be if he(it) was just a bit more involved and had more screen time. The movie is around two and a half hours long and it doesn't ever get boring. I also loved the elevator scene and the chase involving Nick Fury and that awesome car of his."
" Surprisingly good
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,8,"I didn't expect too much from the Captain America franchise, but until 2014 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' actually is one of the better Marvel movies.
After a start that felt like 'Oh, okay it's gonna be this type of a boring movie. Get ready to sleep.' it developed some interesting depth and plot twists. The pacing was good. Good mixture of action and story. Nice one !"
" Yes!
",2019-01-09 00:00:00,10,"My favourite film in the series...
winter soldier (Bucky) is amazing."
" Double Ice Backfire
",2019-01-03 00:00:00,8,"The winter break gave me an opportunity to rewatch a film that, in retrospect, was probably the first film in the MCU to really nail the tone, approach and quality that the series has maintained since. I'm not decrying the earlier films, or suggesting that all the films have maintained this level since but here is where there Russo brothers announced themselves to the series and Markus and McFeely found the right beats that would serve them into the Civil and Infinity Wars.With both World War 2 and the Battle of New York behind him, Steve Rogers struggles to catch up with the years lost in the frozen ice. He soon learns that far from diminishing over the years, the threats to sovereignty have become both more insidious and ideological. When a legendary ghost agent, nicknamed ""The Winter's Soldier"" attacks Nick Fury, it sets into motion a chain of events that turn S.H.I.E.L.D against Rogers and lead him, and a small band of allies, to a desperate battle to save both millions of lives and the soul of the country.""Winter's Soldier"" is, for me, the first time that Marvel realised that they could make other genres of films, utilising their characters (and exaggerating the fight scenes) and move away from the standard superhero plots. The film is a spy thriller, with Steve Rogers, shorn of the advantages that being a SHIELD agent provided him, but forced to stand up to them anyway. Tonally, it's about perfect. A grave threat and a personal issue, assuaged against smart funny scenes of character interaction. It does pull through some of the story threads from ""Avengers Assemble"" to, with Roger's mistrust of Nick Fury's preventative measures tactics again becoming a friction point between the two of them. The film allows for both Sam Jackson's Nick Fury and Scarlett Johansen's Black Widow to show more of the range of their characters, some cracks in their demeanours.Cinematography and direction are great, many of the effects done practically and some of the shots, like the initial rescue assault on a SHIELD research ship, are staggering. It's not perfect though. The stories two big reveals, of the identity of The Winters Soldier and the loyalties of some of the characters is fairly predictable. It sags a little once the opening is done and the fact that the villains constantly underestimate the heroes, despite working alongside them for a while doesn't really make sense.All in all though, this film is a big step into where the MCU stands now and still is one of the best in the series as I write the review."
" Enjoyable. Kick arse action.
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,8,"Some amazing action as expected. Nick Fury set piece was really good. I have always found Captain America to be my least favourite character in the other films , too moralistic and wholesome zzzzz, lookin forward to his exit in End Game. But this film delivers some fun action scenes, Black Widow being as hot as ever, the introduction of Falcon and Winter Soldier are most welcome. Nina massively original story and a little predictable with regards to the main baddie. One of the better Marvel film's. ..........one massive him puzzles me though....Where the hell were the other Avengers whilst this stuff was going on? Makes no sense??? Would they just let this all happened without getting involved.....especially IronMan. Hmmmmmm.."
" A Epic Cool Movie
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,10,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a very cool movie to watch and enjoy. There is strong acting, the plot of the movie make absolute sense, and there are action scenes that catch the audience attention."
" Not as good as the first one but still entertaining
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,7,Not as good as the first one and far from The Avengers but still pretty entertaining!
" Overall it is enjoyable, but it suffers from the same pacing problems that we witnessed in the first fiilm
",2018-12-30 00:00:00,6,"Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is struggling to adapt to life in the modern world after being suspended in a coma for a number of years. However, he is forced to put his objections aside when director of SHIELD Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) is shot down by an unknown assassin. After some digging, Rogers learns that there is a much bigger conspiracy involving Fury being gunned down and sets to work to get to the bottom of said conspiracy...Captain America: The Winter Soldier overall is a decent enough film (certainly in the second half), but sadly the same problems that plagued the original film seem to plague this film and the main problem being;PACING; the first 10-15 minutes or so are great; some fast paced action and a basic set-up to the story, but then things kind of grind to a halt. Some of the scenes in the first half of the picture revolving around Captain America seemed a little too self-congratulatory and don't serve as much purpose as the running time suggests (there is some purpose to some of what we witness which becomes apparent as things manifest later in the film, but personally I felt that proceedings dragged on more than they needed to).Having said that when the main story does develop it is actually pretty good and is more expansive and deeper than the story that we witnessed in the original film. Once you're hooked it's pretty involving and I did like the way that director Anthony Russo retained the light-hearted approach that Joe Johnston applied to the original film. The humorous exchanges and light touches within the film made it palatable and digestible which did serve the film well over its rather generous 120 minute plus running time.The acting from the principal cast is mostly good with Evans really getting into the skin of his character; it was more difficult for him to achieve this effect in this first film (for obvious reasons), but he does a solid job here. Anthony Mackie is also excellent and offers strong support. Scarlett Johansson is also very good and I think I may have finally fallen in love with her voice; she could read me my miranda rights and I would still take notice and that's not even acknowledging that she looks hot as hell here. If we're talking about acting then Samuel L Jackson does OK, but this particular role is not really stretching him, but what does let this film down slightly is Robert Redford whose inclusion in the film seems a little too obvious and I would suspect that most people would be able to see who is and what he's about more or less straight away.Overall, Captain America: Winter Soldier does work as the plot is richer and more deeper than the first film, but it does suffer from the same pacing problems as the first film with one cast member who is too obvious as highlighted in the above paragraph. However, in summary, like the first film this is worth watching, but also like the first film it isn't quite the spectacular blockbuster that it thinks it is."

",2018-11-28 00:00:00,10,Expect the RUSSO brothers to shine whilst watching this movie because it is insane. Captain Rogers works incessantly in the gymnasium to prove his worth as an AVENGER from our dimension which is planet earth. Continuation from the frost and ice by working those villains down the dirt using ice packs for our aid.
" a great superhero movie
",2018-11-13 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you the giant egos within the avengers and what team work actually takes to balance it all out. The direction is really good. The screenplay is really good. The cast give it their all only to strike out against a political villain played by Robert Redford. A low camera angle is used in order to convey to us that Robert Redford is in fact the villain of this classic superhero story. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" A really entertaining, well written, well directed sequel for Captain America.
",2018-10-28 00:00:00,10,"Captain America is back and less boring and more interesting than he was in his last outings.The Russo Brothers have worked their socks off trying to make a Captain America that's fresh and different than what we expect. This movie lays the ground for multiple stories and plotlines for Marvel to explore.It introduces Sharon Carter (Niece of Peggy), Crossbones, Falcon and the WInter Soldier who turns out to be Bucky Barnes (gasp!)This movie has certainly gone down to be a true fan favourite and in my opinion is the best movie in the Captain America Trilogy. And after seeing the Russo Brothers work their magic for Civil War and Infinity War, I can't wait to see what they'll do for Avengers 4!"
" Better than the first one
",2018-10-19 00:00:00,8,"Captain America the first avenger was wasted potential the first half was great and the second half felt rushed.
The sequel however is great better than the first movie.TONE
The tone in this movie is very different from the tone in the last movie.
Captain America and the first avengers was a Science fiction-film, but they changed that in the Winter soldier and made the movie into a Thriller.
I like the tone better in this one.
It's a tone that is different from Marvel but not to different so that the movie doesn't fit in with the MCU the thing that The incredible hulk did.ACTION
This is a fast paced movie, the main plot already starts at the 10 minute mark.
It's good that it's fast paced it keeps the viewer interested.
The choreography for the action is pretty good.
The russo brothers have always managed to make good Action and Fight scenes.
The ne in the first movie was pretty bad.
The best one in the movie was when Bucky and Steve first fought each other.
The choreo was amazing and the different techniques they used to fight was really cool and the fight scene was overall well thought out but the final act was the only part where the fighting sucked.VILLAIN
The villain sucked.
there was actually two villains, The winter soldier and Alexander pierce both of them where bad.
The winter soldier barely talked through out the movie he wasn't even there through out the movie.
They should have developed Winter soldier so that we would like him more as a villain and if not that they could have made Alexander pierce a better villain.
His motive ""Kill 20 million to save 7 billion"" it's basically the same as i want to destroy the world but they lazily changed it up a bit.
If the winter soldier sucked as a villain and Alexander pierce was a good villain then it would be okay but because both of them sucked it's not okay.CHARACTERS
The characters are pretty good.
Steve rogers was good, Black widow was good, Sam wilson was meh and Nick fury was meh.
They managed to develop Steve rogers more as character and him wanting to do the right thing no matter what happens to him really ads to his character.
Black widow was also good we get to know her better as a character but Sam wilson and Nick fury didn't have much development but i like Nick fury more because of this movie and how important he is in this movie.FINAL ACT
Let me keep this short.
The final act was a mess.
really mediocre to bad action.
The final battle between Steve and Bucky didn't have any stakes nor did it carry any weight it was all boring action.
But that's just how i feel.VERDICT
Just watch the movie"
" Another entertaining superhero outing with a great cast of characters and excellent special effects.
",2018-10-12 00:00:00,8,"The plot gets too muddled up by trying to be both relevant to modern audiences and true to its own lore, but the balance of action and the few light moments keep it enjoyable and well-paced."
" Great action movie
",2018-10-06 00:00:00,10,Now this movie is awesome great action this movie so much bettef then civil war that one was eh but this one is great the fighting and story was great good movie.
" Just hear me out
",2018-09-29 00:00:00,10,This is what I'm talking about! They made captain America look so weak in the first avengers movie. So glad they made it up with this. Great action intense fighting scene that make you feel like your in the fight. In this movie you get to see how the cap truly works with his abilities. Very good story line. It's cool how you see the captain America movies get better and better.
" A superhero movie with a political thriller backdrop
",2018-09-21 00:00:00,8,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier gives us a chance to see The Captain as a real superhero, and it exposes some of his vulnerabilities, as well. This movie offers up an intimidating opponent against the backdrop of a political thriller. There may be a few too many one-liners in this film -- everyone is a comedian -- and there are some plot holes that you'll politely have to ignore, but overall this is an enjoyable superhero movie with plenty of action."
" Captain America.... Truth and Honesty
",2018-09-17 00:00:00,10,"My favourite super hero. 
Represents honesty, freedom and nationalism. Thor is my second fav."
" Almost only images
",2018-09-16 00:00:00,5,"Yes images show car crashes, cuffing snd punching, shooting, fires and explosions galore and all the time. The visual effects and the stunt performers are overwhelming indeed and that is almost all since the plot is rather weak. We hardly can tell who are the good boys and the bad boys (supposing of course that Captain America is on the side of the good ones) and it's difficult to tell who is against whom and what are they aiming at. The Winter Soldier is mentioned only once and it is difficult to say who he is. Well it's a movie to be seen and forgotten."
" If only 'The Dark World' was like this
",2018-09-07 00:00:00,8,"I don't know why some people didn't really go much for the first 'Captain America' film. Yes, I know it was a success, but it's never really talked about as one of the MCU's vest offerings. Maybe it was because it wasn't set in the present and therefore somehow felt less relevant to some cinema-goers? Anyway, I liked it. But, for those who wanted to see our (now UNfrozen) 'First Avenger' getting to grips with the modern world, they really got what they were looking for here.I think the best way to describe the 'Captain America' sequel is by calling it a 'Jason Bourne film with superheroes.' If you're familiar with the 'Bourne' franchise then you'll know the titular character is a spy who uncovers some disturbing truths in his own intelligence organisation and has to go on the run, pursued by rogue agents who were once on his side. This is basically the plot to 'The Winter Solider.' It may not be completely original, but it is damn good fun.There's all the action and chase scenes you'd expect from a spy thriller, plus it's naturally 'beefed up' as many of the protagonists have a multitude of special powers to give the action an added boost. Plus, because it's all set in our modern surroundings (no need for a 'Ragnarok-style' alien planet to be created here) the computer effects required aren't too overbearing and noticeable.I guess the best thing about 'Part 2' is that it has more 'character development' that your average superhero movie. We last saw 'Cap' in his 1940s world, so there's plenty of time for the story to show us how a man from the past deals with present day, not to mention the fact that he was once used to fighting for an 'honourable' power system whereas now the lines of good and evil can sometimes get a little blurred, even on our own side.If the film has a flaw then it kind of falls into that oh-so familiar trap than many Marvel films do (or at least the ones not featuring Loki) and that's the fact that the villain is a little underused. I guess you could say that 'The Winter Soldier' has two villains - one you'll probably forget completely and the other is the titular 'Winter Soldier' himself. The problem is that he just pops up here and there to cause a bit of bother for Cap and then we don't see him again for a while until the next action scene is upon us. There's also a bit of an over-used plot device in which characters 'die' only for us to find out that they're not really dead later. I won't say who or how many as that runs into 'spoiler' territory.But, don't let those minor gripes detract from what is one hell of a fun ride. It really does cover more than a few genres, i.e. superhero, action, spy, chase, thriller and does them all justice here. There's pretty much something for everyone here and Marvel show that not all second instalments have to be a 'Dark World' (that's a 'Thor' joke, that is!)."
" In heroes we trust
",2018-08-31 00:00:00,8,"Imagining awakening up after about 70 years of being ice cold. That is what Steve Rogers (played by Chris Evans) has to deal with, and it's not just about watching every single classic movie since the 40's. It's also about morality and finding out that those who you trust may not be so trustworthy. When Captain goes after the Winter Soldier, he is branded as a traitor and must line up with Black Widow (played by Golden Globe Nominee Scarlett Johansson) and Falcon (played by Anthony Mackie) to get to the bottom of what is going on here. He also finds out that the Winter Soldier is more than just an assassin.Let me just say this: Spider-Man is my favorite hero, while Batman has produced the best superhero of all time (The Dark Knight). But, when it comes to the MCU, my favorite hero is Captain America. In this film, not only does he fight for what's good for America, but that also includes going against government officials whose morals have gone out the window. If the American government is corrupt, he will go against it. Captain America is a hero that we need in this time of government turbulence.As for the actors, well they all play their parts well. Steve Rogers practically IS Captain America, and he conveys the confusion and the morality of Captain America well. Scarlett Johansson is at her MCU best in this film; she is the one who stays by Captain America throughout this whole process. Academy Award Nominee Samuel L. Jackson is his Samuel L. Jackson self in this film, which is always a good thing. But this time we get a couple of newcomers. Anthony Mackie is awesome as Falcon, as he gets a few pretty sweet moments himself. And the great Academy Award Winner Robert Redford always does a great job with whatever role he is presented with.All in all, a great film! Go and watch it!"
" Great movie.
",2018-08-28 00:00:00,9,This is a great movie. It has a great story line. It also has great acting. It is very fast past. See it. It is one of the best movies ever. The Avengers is better. But still is a very good movie.
" Awesome!!!
",2018-08-08 00:00:00,9,"Haven't seen a film as good as this since Avengers. Cap is trying to come to terms with modern day life in the 21st century after being on ice for a couple decades he has a lot to catch up on. He works with S.H.I.E.L.D still and helps them out. They the into dice something which Steve doesn't support; hellicarriers to keep everyone in check. The leaders of S.H.I.E.L.D. are eliminated and replaced with HYDRA. Robert Redford plays the excellent and cool bad guy, while the other actors also play well but not as good. The whole film is a huge political thriller played very well. Black Widow and Falcon side star in this making it half an Avengers movie. The Winter Soldier was awesome and then we found out he was Bucky, that was a huge surprise. The whole film was non-stop great throughout. Overall I'm highly inpressed an door Marvel continues to make awesome films like this."
" I'm Convinced
",2018-08-08 00:00:00,9,"So, prior to this moment, Captain America was my absolute LEAST favorite superhero in the entire genre and in every conceivable medium. I thought of the protagonist as boring and two-dimensional at best. From the 40s? Silly shield? Strong, fast and very resilient was just -somehow- not enough for me.Well; slap my mouth shut.This movie won me way over. Chris Evans brings him right into 4D. The action -unlike the sickening majority of action flicks- is top notch AND followable! No shaky cameras and early, choppy cutaways; we get to see every delicious moment. And the storyline is solid and compelling.The main character is portrayed by potentially the least famous person in the central cast and he totally carries the movie. It should be noted that only 4 years after CA:TWS, Robert Redford called it quits on his incredible acting career. Those of you who are unfamiliar with this filmagraphic icon should look him up. The fact that this script compelled his contribution should speak volumes.Well Done."
" action is good, story is good just watch it
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,7,"I think winter soldier is the only good marvel movies , the story is good, the action is great, and its a serious movie , im glad im not seeing that much stupid marvel joke in this movie."
" All American hero vs a secret cabal
",2018-07-25 00:00:00,7,"An American fantasty action film; A story about a superhuman soldier who becomes an operative for a secret intelligence agency called SHIELD, but grows suspicious of their motives. He and a fellow Avenger callled Black Widow become fugitives, and try to bring down a sinister conspiracy.
The unquenchable thirst for advancements in technology to solve potential conflicts is the main theme. It's a comic-book conspiracy thriller about frightening new military apparatus drawing uneasy parallels for the audience in a post-9/11 world. Captain America is a welcome contrast to other Marvel characters - more depth and principled, and more humanlike - a 1940s hero amidst all the bright lights, bells and whistles of industrialised magic."
" the best movie EVER
",2018-07-23 00:00:00,10,"This movie is my favorite marvel movie and favorite movie in general. this might sound like the ramblings of another fangirl (and maybe it is) but i haven't met a single person who hasn't enjoyed this movie. it's suspenseful, thrilling, action-packed, and even romantic. but no, not between natasha romanoff and steve rogers and not even between sharon carter and steve rogers. but between bucky barnes and steve rogers. i like to think of this movie as a love story; a dance. bucky and steve go back and forth like a dance. they are just childhood best friends who have been ripped apart by war, time, and life's cruelties. but i think this movie can resonate with everyone, whether you enjoy action-packed thrillers or rom-coms. the acting is incredible (especially by sebastian stan who barely has any lines but can convey 3 lifetimes worth of pain through one look), the action scenes are exciting and engaging, and the fight choreography is hands-down the best i have ever seen. this movie even fits in a bit of humor and some moral/political debates as well. this movie is everything and i wish i could give it more than 10 stars. i would also give bucky barnes my life just to see him happy."
" Best Combat action!!!
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,9,One of the best hand to hand combat action movie. The way cap & winter soldier fought with bear hand was really impressive. Sending nick fury off to grid was really cool. Bucky did great as a winter soldier. Black widow & sam did great. Its a complete action entertainment movie. Storyline was great. :)
" Do not trust anyone but yourself.
",2018-06-13 00:00:00,8,"On March 19, Marvel and Disney withdrew a ban on the publication of any reviews and reviews of the over-coming spring blockbuster ""The First Avenger: Another War."" They were removed because it was on this day that a special, first in Russia closed film was shown at the Oktyabr cinema. Unfortunately, no photographs could be made, since Marvel on similar premieres usually requires to hand over at the entrance to the hall all electronic devices. But, nevertheless, the film itself is important.After the attempt on the very director of ""Shield"" Nick Fury, it becomes clear that the traitors are deep inside the organization itself. Captain America is involved in a large-scale villainous action to destroy disagreeable ""Hydra"" personalities. Moreover, he, like the Black Widow, is wanted as a possible supporter of a secret conspiracy. Now he can trust only himself. In addition to everything, a mysterious masked man appears on the scene, known as the Winter Soldier, who has practically the same powers as Steve Rogers himself.Nothing more on the subject can not say, since it will necessarily entail spoilers, because the movie is directly packed full of intrigues and incredible plot twists. During the show, the hall repeatedly exploded with applause at the next plot move.As a person who has watched repeatedly any of the existing Marvel films, I can say that ""The First Avenger 2"" can rightfully be considered one of the best, filmed by the studio. The fact is that after the plague success of the ""Avengers"" abounding with colorful characters, you involuntarily begin to compare each next film with them. In my opinion, Thor is the weakest hero in order to play solo. If not for the charismatic Loki, the film in general would be very weak. The first ""Captain"" also did not differ in any scale and originality of the plot, but in the sequel everything is quite different.
To begin with, the second part has grown significantly in terms of special effects. It is understandable - after all, the action takes place already in the modern world, and not during the Second World War. In addition to this company Cap was composed of Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson) and the red-haired beauty of the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), as well as the new character Sokol (Anthony Maki). All this ensemble is simply superbly interacting with each other, succeeding and joking, and even add a small share of romance. (No blueness, it's all right). Scarlett Johansson has a lot of time, which allows her character and true intentions to be revealed. It makes no sense to say something about the acting, because these characters are performed by the same actors for the first time.There are a lot of questions in the film, which remain almost unanswered. Why was the attempt on Nick Fury committed? Who is behind this? Who is this Winter Soldier and where did he come from? Who can be trusted when there are only traitors around? Fortunately, you will certainly know the answers by the end of the film. By the way, it is worth saying that the ending leaves room for trikvela, which, of course, will be.As I wrote earlier, you involuntarily compare any solo film of heroes from the Avengers with the Avengers themselves. So the ""First Avenger"" can easily compete with the flagship team of superheroes. The plot is twisted much more seriously, than there, jokes and references also suffice in excess. The only drawback of the film - the absence of the agent Phil Colson, which has long been an integral part of the Marvel blockbuster. If someone does not know, the most charming agent of SHIELD does not actually die in Avengers. This is seen in the series ""Agents SHIELD"", which also produces now Marvel.
The picture was shown to us in the IMAX 3D format. And I must say that it looks really cool. Again, comparing with the scale of the ""Avengers"", the spectacle here is no worse. And somewhere even better. It can be seen that the creators tried to do without the use of computer graphics in those places where it was possible. Therefore, the natural filming in the film is much more than artificially drawn episodes.In short, strange as it may sound, ""The First Avenger: Another War"" is different from any other Marvel movie. At least because of the fact that there is not all tied up on the steep heroes and fatal beauties. Here you will find also a certain hidden subtext, which someone, perhaps, will make you think. After all, Captain America is not just another superhero. This is the most patriotic man in America, her symbol. By the will of fate, he was not in his time and not in his world, but he had to make up for what he had missed in 70 years. He is tormented by a sense of guilt and a feeling that he is not the one who needs this world. But only a real hero is able to find the strength to forget about himself and fight for his friends.And finally, the remark about the localization of the film's name. Someone will find it funny how our distributors translated this title. But I assure you, they did it for a reason. ""Other War"" in this case conveys the meaning of the film better than the original name itself."
" A Stunner
",2018-06-06 00:00:00,10,This MUST be one of the Best super heroes movies i've ever seen. The actions scenes was absolutely magnificent. An Movie that worh watching more Than one
" The sequel we deserved following the stakes of The Avengers
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,9,"~Review originally posted via Instagram (at ""@oratiosanctus"") on May 20th, 2018.***In a post-Infinity War world, does a film like The Winter Soldier still hold its place in the Marvel ranks as one of its best? The simple answer, yes. When the task came to create a Captain America sequel that followed on from the events of The Avengers (2012), the task fell to the Russo Brothers (then newcomers to Marvel Studios) to create a film where the stakes felt higher than ever. How do you do that? By writing an espionage thriller that compromises the very agency the heroes always thought they could rely on, S.H.I.E.L.D.Watching this film again after a fair few years past, I was delighted by how well it still holds up; not only as a superhero flick but as a riveting and hard-edged drama. At its core, this is essentially a film that is a story of brothers: both new and old; one's gained and those lost. It's there The Winter Soldier finds its heart. Even if you remove the excellent action set-pieces that drive a huge part of this movie or the gorgeous cinematography that fill its almost every frame, the performances by each member of the cast - from Chris Evans' Steve Rogers/Captain America to Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, to Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury and Cobie Smulder's Maria Hill - is the movie's real strength. The actor's performances are carried home by these threatened notions of family and the comfort that had once come with that.Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson/Falcon gives a wonderful turn in this movie, breathing life into the picture as a likeable ally to Cap, but it's with Sebastian Stan's phenomenal turn as the mysterious Winter Soldier that the film finds its true standout. No longer the Bucky we knew, he is every bit as shocking and threatening as he needed to be and Stan's performance is one driven by tragedy and emotional loss. He is utterly convincing in the role.Captain America: The Winter Soldier holds its place as one of the MCU's most consistent films to date, and is a must-watch for all Marvel fans."
" When Captain America Meets a 70's Spy Thriller
",2018-05-18 00:00:00,10,"Captain America's second solo outing in the MCU was something that I wasn't sure about at first. Some plot points can be a bit confusing upon your first viewing if you are not paying super close attention to every little detail. However, upon my second viewing, it all came together. In my opinion, there are only 3 comic book films that are good movies, not just superhero movies. These are movies with deep characters and complex story elements. Those 3 movies are Dark Knight, Logan, and Winter Soldier; this movie is amazing. First off, this film really does Captain America justice. He is so awesome in this movie. Just in the first ten minutes you really start to buy into the idea that he is the greatest soldier in history. I like the Russo brothers vision of the character in this film. Cap is the definition of the American Dream; the moral guy who was your great neighbor; but now in 2014, things aren't exactly the same. He quickly realizes he can't just trust anybody that easily, even his allies. Nick Fury and Natasha Romanoff are fantastic characters to have in this film for that exact reason. We know Cap can trust them, but they are still very, very complex people with shady personalities. SHIELD is hiding very big secrets and when Cap has an unknown mercenary after him, things get more out of hand. The pacing in this film is excellent. It has frequent action but there is one time where roughly 25 minutes go by without any action, but I wasn't bored at all, The things that happen in there are interesting story and character building. The film has a great look. The CGI is polished in a way that fits well with this political thriller theme. A lot of people don't like this movie, and I sort of understand, it's easy to get lost. If you know what is going on though, this film is so much deeper than it appears. Next time you have family movie night, give this one a watch!"
" The ""culmination"" of the last 10 years works very well.
",2018-05-05 00:00:00,9,"AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR is the best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Said to be the culmination of 10 years worth of Marvel films - and Marvel heroes - INFINITY WAR lives up to it's bill, bringing all the Marvel Universe heroes together to fight a ""big bad"" that is worthy of this sort of thing - THANOS. Voiced by Josh Brolin, the CGI Thanos is powerful, destructive, razor-focused on his one purpose with moments of ""humanity"" that makes him an interesting villain. The filmmakers kept his motivation and machinations simple so you are never confused by this bad guy or what he is trying to do. What surprised me is that the filmmakers added another layer to this character that was a nice layer that really added to the character, his motivations and his personality.As for the band of heroes brought together for this film, it works well. The criticisms I have heard is that no ONE hero stands out, so EVERY hero is in the background. I couldn't disagree more. I thought the evenness of the ""screen time"" was one of the strengths of this film, not focusing too much on one hero (or heroes), giving all time to shine - and focus on what they do best. There were moments of humor, drama, action and heroism sprinkled across all. But what really thrilled me was the different combinations that were put together, for these heroes all had different missions and assignments and some odd and interesting cross-film dynamics took shape. I won't give any of these away, but I thought they ALL dynamics blended together nicely.This is definitely a ""fan-boy"" film, giving service to fans of all these films, characters - and comics and credit for that should go to filmmakers Anthony and Joe Russo (Directors of the previously best film in this series - CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER) who kept the action moving, the motivations of the participants simple and the effects dazzling.One final note - this is the first part of a two part film, so it does end in a cliffhanger, one that works effectively well. As always with the Marvel films - but especially in this one - stay through to the end of the credits, the scene at the end of the credits sets up Part 2.I thoroughly enjoyed my time at this film and can't wait to see the next one.Letter Grade: A9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
" Honestly, one of the greatest superhero movies of all time.
",2018-05-02 00:00:00,10,"Best actions scenes in the MCU, period. So many brilliant coreographed fights that went along with the pace of what this story tried to feed. It felt tense and not tense exactly when it needed to. All of the characters were essential to what was going on, and that pushed the movie to excellence"
" OK.
",2018-04-28 00:00:00,8,"Not as good as the first one. It's better as a stand alone movie without Captain America. The fight scenes are beautiful, though."
" The Sentinal Of Liberty
",2018-04-28 00:00:00,9,"This film greatly improved upon its predecessor, and I loved the last film so that should tell you what I think about this film. The Russo's direction is wonderful and nuanced with Evans giving another outstanding performance as Steve Rodgers, and the added chemistry between him and Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow give the film closer relationships to play with. The emotional fight between The Winter Soldier and Cap gets me every time. This film will always be in my top rated MCU Films and I'll be with it til the end of the Line."
" Captain America is back
",2018-04-23 00:00:00,7,It is always pleasure to watch a marvel series. And this one rocks with Chris Evans carrying out his another fight against evil. What looked average in this movie was the repetition and poor association. Though attempted fine yet it did do well overall in casting much impact.
" I love this movie.
",2018-04-16 00:00:00,8,"This movie is great in every way - story, acting, character development, effects, cinematography, humor, drama, and action. I have no complaints for this movie and would highly recommend it. This movie is extremely well done and entertaining. I had a lot of fun watching it."
" A sequel that ups its predecessor in every way
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,9,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier is the sequel to the first Captain America Movie and follows the events of The Avengers with expanding on the corporate SHIELD and the secrets they've been hiding in it for decades. And this movie is a huge improvement on the first film. The story is one of the freshest stories have come up with to date with its gritty fight sequences and twists no one can expect at all in this film, all thanks to the Russo Brothers. With the strong direction by the Russo brothers this film gets a face lift from the first and brings the film to a modern age that it needed. Getting away from the '40's and showing a more modern Cap that's still trying to adjust to the new world he has missed since being frozen adds a lot of funny sequences and great one lines that are executed perfectly in this film. My favorite part of this film though is the fights, each scene for them feels brand new and not one feels like a copycat or a recreation of the first movie or anywhere else. And that's one of the best things with this film is the originality that the Russo brothers put into this film. And now with them directing Civil War and Infinity War. They have made a mark in Marvel as being one of the best directors yet. The writing done by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely did a fantastic job on this script. The dialogue feels so real and fits each and every cast member perfectly with its fast jokes and memorable lines throughout. Even the minor characters that we've gotten sneak peaks at in The Avengers have made memorable parts in this film playing key points in the overall story telling. Even Chris Evan and Scarlett Johansson writing the dialogue for the scenes between them feels so natural and adds a huge comedy piece as they try to get Steve a date with anyone in his life. The acting is once again amazing by its key cast (Evans, Johansson, Jackson) with the new faces as well killing each and every role. Especially the broken and confused Bucky/Winter Soldier played by Stan and the quick witted and perfect partner to Steve, Sam Wilson played by Anthony Mackie. And of course my favorite new performance in the film is done by the legendary Robert Redford with his offputting look and twisting dialogue that's shown throughout. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a fantastic film with a single plot hole that, yes, was explained in a deleted scene but never put into the final product is why did he go and get his old suit when he had a modern day battle ready one that was perfectly fine? Captain America: The Winter Soldier gets a 9.5/10"
" Fits of Fury
",2018-03-22 00:00:00,10,"In this film Captain America (Chris Evans) is attempting to catch up. He is losing some of the dorkiness which made him lovable. He teams up with the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) because she tested well with male audiences in the 8 to 80 age bracket. Iron Man is mentioned, but it seems the rest of the Avengers are on vacation during the struggle for humanity.This film has a decent plot (i.e. fitting bad guys for good guys) with a good mix of action and drama. It even has some light moments such as when our twosome are among some old computers and Black Widow does her 1983 ""WarGames"" voice and proclaims, ""Shall we play a game?"" Of course Captain America can't catch the humor.Great popcorn film that explodes on the screen. I enjoyed this more than the recent Thor film."
" Better then The First Avenger
",2018-03-15 00:00:00,10,Honestly I think this one is 10X better then the first one. We know that Bucky is alive and was programed later on to become weapon known as the Winter Soldier.The best scenes are when Cap and bucky have a fight on the road and on the landing bay at SHIELD. When Arnim Zola triggers a bomb in the lab and destroyed the building and when Steve takes the elevator but gets attacked by agents.Samuel L Jackson definitely improved as Nick Fury in this movie and it turned out that his eye patch had a tracer or boob in it I can't remember why he burned it.Overall awesome movie 10/10
" Much better than I expected, especially after the first film
",2018-01-27 00:00:00,8,"The first Captain America was fine, though not fantastic, and then got
ruined right at the end. Given that, and having seen most of the recent
superhero / comic-book movies I wasn't expecting much from this. That
is was expecting all style, no substance, token plot, wooden
performances, lives and dies by action scenes and special effects.Captain America: The Winter Soldier has the action scenes and special
effects, but it has much more than that. Plot is fairly good. Not
watertight, but moves along well, mostly makes sense, and has some
character development.Performances are good. The interplay between Chris Evans and Scarlett
Johansson works and the supporting cast give solid performances.Overall, an entertaining movie and the best of the Marvel movies."
" A Yes
",2018-01-05 00:00:00,6,"GoodA piece of art is either Good or Bad. A Yes, you would recommend it to others or a No, don't waste your time"
" An excellent action/Superhero film. It's fun, but also serious and engaging enough to make I interesting for the entire runtime, with some great action sequences
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,9,"This was so much better than I was expecting! Sure, I liked the first Captain America film, but in reality, he's not Marvel's strongest character - just their version of Superman, but he CAN die from a bullet. However, they were smart with this one, bringing in a strong cast to back Cap up - with familiar faces Black Widow (Johansson), Nick Fury (Jackson), Maria Hill (Smulders), Jasper Sitwell (Hernández) and Senator Stern (Shandling) all in at least one of the other films or the TV show - plus Falcon (Mackie) and Senator Pierce (Redford) as the new additions. The biggest mystery - if you haven't read the comics - is who the Winter Soldier is, and it does a pretty good job of the reveal (no spoilers here!). The whole film flows on nicely from the 'The First Avenger' and 'The Avengers'.I was really happy with the pacing - it does a great job of reintroducing the familiar characters and bringing in the new ones and then there's plenty of action and great set-pieces - most on a scale I didn't believe Captain America could/would accommodate. And there's plenty of humour too, even when the characters are in dire straits. It also works well for the first 90min or so as a pretty great mystery, with plenty of curve-balls and ""did that really happen?"" moments. This is really fun to watch, as you get to see more of Steve Rogers as a character, rather than Captain America, the warrior. It's also nice to see Cap and Black Widow spending time together not fighting enemies - although I'm biased, because I would watch Scarlett Johansson in anything! But the best parts are still the action sequences - they've given Cap some great moves and it's just plain fun to watch him and how they've filmed it.The Stan Lee cameo/one-liner is great and links in nicely with an earlier scene and Danny Pudi from Community even gets a pretty funny scene. It's also nice to see Fury play a more pivotal role, rather than one or two small scenes. The plot gets a little absurd near the end, but it gives Cap, Black Window and Falcon a mission and sets up a huge battle in the final 20min. There's sure to be some repercussions from the events of this film. And we only have to wait two years until the next Captain America film, which is a good thing, seeing how well made this one was. As always, stay until after the end titles for a very revealing scene!"
" a spy thriller in a superhero movie for one exciting journey
",2017-12-29 00:00:00,8,Cap is back in the first movie in his series we were given the origin set in the 1940s but now with un frozen cap who comes into a world with the internet and new threats too. Chris Evens is our hero in the colors of america as he works for S.H.I.E.L.D. and is also working alongside fellow avenger black widow played by Scarlett Johansson and these two have some amazing scenes together showing their chemistry and that they make a great team they aren't the only heroes with new addition of the Falcon played by Anthony Mackie who brings the new hero to life. also in the cast is the return of the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Nick Fury played by the amazing Samuel L. Jackson and this movie also stars Robert Redford and series return to Sebastian Stan and MCU return for Cobie Smulders. with a modern world that Steve Rodgers aka Captain america has come into he will have to save the world from a threat that he thought was long dead in one of Marvels greatest films to date and some of the greatest action set pieces that has been produced from a hero movie and the story is equals as a thriller and a hero movie with neither crossing over too much i love this one and it will be one of my favorite marvel movies that have been released.
" A well paced movie...
",2017-12-28 00:00:00,10,"This movie is very well paced, and is balanced with a well told story, and proper fight scenes. This movie brought Captain America the justice he deserved."
" It's easy to see why this is commonly regarded as one of the most popular MCU films to date.
",2017-11-20 00:00:00,10,"'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is a film that needs no introduction. What directors Joe and Anthony Russo (who, might I add, were originally known for their work on comedies before they were hired to direct this) managed to accomplish with this film is quite impressive. Simply put, they managed to give us one of the most tightly-scripted outings of the MCU with a story that pays homage to classic 70's spy thrillers while also addressing Captain America's jump from the simpler days of World War II to the morally grey ordeals of the modern world. And it's all tied to one of the MCU's greatest twists that takes the franchise in a completely new direction. The action sequences are incredible and Chris Evans, Scarlett Johannsson, and Samuel L. Jackson shine in arguably their greatest turns as Cap, Black Widow, and Nick Fury, respectively.Now with that said, admittedly I wouldn't call this one my absolute favorite MCU film to date. Still, I very much appreciate this film for everything that it did for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. For one thing, it helped revitalize the franchise after the admittedly rocky year that it had in 2013 as evident from the polarizing 'Iron Man 3' and the not-so-popular 'Thor: The Dark World'. Plus, its iconic twist allowed Marvel Studios' first TV series, 'Agents of SHIELD', to finally find its groove after a rocky start. Thus, it may not be my #1 favorite, but it's certainly in the Top 5."
" A big win for the comic book genre
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,9,"Great film. Worth my time and yours. I had a lot of fun with this one, the characters are neat, Chris Evans does a great job as Captain America, the effects and fights are nice, the film goes at a very nice pace, and was overall enjoyable. In Marvel we trust, they know how to make these movies."
" Captain America The Winter Soldier is fun, entertaining and enjoyable action, superhero movie with breathtaking action sequences.
",2017-09-26 00:00:00,9,"Captain America The Winder Soldier: Movie Review.Captain America The Winter Soldier is one of the best film by Marvel. The film has very rock solid character developments and moments, superb cast characters performances,top notch quality storytelling and beautiful visual effects. Captain America The Winter Soldier is visually dazzling, political conspiracy suspenseful thriller with strong cast performances and surprising intense and intriguing storyline and plot twist. The movie looks visually stunning.The direction is amazing and Chris Evans is awesome as Captain America. Chris Evans with his charismatic charming personality and has made the character of Captain America looks great and emotionally enjoyable. Scarlett Johansson is fabulous as always. She has once again given a truly solid performance as Black Widow and Samuel L.Jackson is incredible as Nick Fury. Sebastian Stan as Winter Soldier and Robert Redford as the main villains have also done a good job. The plot and story sometimes seems to be off the course and little bit rushed in the portrayals of main villains. Some CGI shots lacks realism and feels little bit overdone. All over Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a great movie and it is also one of the best movies of Marvel Studios and a great addition to Marvel Cinematic Universe.(Please Note: That This Review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film, and does not represent others. Thank You)."
" Much better than Dark World
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,7,"What I liked1. Unlike Dark world, at least this was memorable2. Falcon had a pretty good debut film here3. The reveal that Hydra is not dead was something that I felt was well done4. Nick Fury's deathWhat I didn't like1. Nick Fury then turning out to be alive felt like a massive cop out2. I am just not a big fan of Black Widow here3. It is a little longOverall this film is actually pretty decent even if it does have a few minor flaws. This is by far the best phase 2 MCU film and the only phase two film that I felt like was actually worth watching at all."
" Just Brilliant.
",2017-09-09 00:00:00,9,"Winter Soldier is possibly still my favourite Marvel movie, with an engaging and engrossing story, tremendous action and a terrific cast. I loved it at the cinema and a re-watch on blue ray last night confirmed how good it is.Robert Redford in Washington - shades of All The President's Men! He may be pretty old but he just oozes class. Marvel always seem to go for high calibre actors. No exception here.The plot of course concerns Cap investigating a conspiracy within SHIELD, abetted by Black Widow with a first appearance from The Falcon. They made a great team - a sort of mini-Avengers.Sam Jackson gets a bit more to do - hurrah - and if you missed the quote on the tombstone, have another look. Fantastic little in-joke. Seb Stan is great as the tormented Soldier, putting the lie to the claim that Marvel villains are all generic.Cap's fight in the elevator is superb - as are all the fight scenes, and if one or two plot points are a bit far fetched I can forgive that easily. Doc Zola's algorithm which predicts future threats to HYDRA so they can be assassinated is a case in point.Great CBM, then. Civil War is almost as good."
" Review
",2017-08-04 00:00:00,10,"Very good movie. Story was compelling. Action sequences were crisp, well directed and well spaced to keep you on the edge of your seats. Emotional connection between Bucky and Cap was established. 5 out of 5 stars. Other directors should learn from this director on how to make a good movie."
" Price of freedom is high...always has been
",2017-07-31 00:00:00,9,"Marvel delivers is best movie yet with a film that nails it on every front. The story, writing, directing, action, effects, cast performance were all top notch. It made Cap into my new favorite character as he is no longer the boy scout we saw in the First Avenger and in the Avengers. The Russo bros. proved that they can be true leaders in the MCU and their future with this franchise is guaranteed to be great.Starting with the cast, Chris Evans proves he can be a leading man in big films. As Rogers, he showed all sides being humorous, humble, powerful and threatening. They could have made it depressing having Cap deal with being defrosted and outliving all his friends and loved ones. Having him with a list of things with watch and read was funny. Meeting with Peggy, who is still alive but with dementia, was sweet but still really heartbreaking. Johansson's Romanoff was as good as Evans and she is showed much more dimensions to her character. She showed that she wants a true friend in Cap. I love what the Russo bros said about Widow and Cap how they are work wife/work husband. As there is romantic/sexual tension between them but they trust each other enough that they know the need each other professionally. Mackie's Falcon was awesome too, as he is a new partner for Cap that showed so much swagger. He also had a great insight into being a veteran of war that meshed well with Rogers. The villains were great too. Redford's Pierce was great as a tactical leader of Hydra. He brought enough charisma into his performance that did not diminish the power he had and the brutality he delivers. Winter Soldier was also awesome as he proved to be just like Cap, and I won't reveal his true identity, but his effect against Cap, both physically and psychologically, was well acted by both Evans and Stan. The story in this film was incredible, cohesive and thought- provoking. The idea of how freedom can be difficult to control as it is, by it's definition, independent from any control was well done as Cap adjusts to the new world. The writing, dialogue, humor was also amazing from the directors who did Arrested Development and Community and the screenwriters also created Agent Carter helped writing for other good Marvel movies. The action in this movie, especially fight choreography was simply breathtaking. The infiltration on the freighter, the elevator fight, the highway fight and the final battle, is some of the best choreography made in any action film. The effects were minimized for this film, which I really appreciate as the practical effects and stunt choreography was perfect. The helicarriers and Falcon in flight were very well done and looked so real over the Potomac river.I really don't have a complaint for this film but there are a few tiny things that bother me. Why didn't they call in the Avengers in the final scene? Iron Man was supposedly retired but Hulk still could have helped. Why are so many people in the MCU dead but not really? Does anyone stay dead? I mean there are villains but basically no heroes die.But those are very tiny things in an almost perfect superhero movie.+ Cap and Widow relationship + Cast performances all around + Writing, directing, story + Impeccable action, effects and stunts - Tiny, tiny problems that you can only overthinkFinal Score: 9.7/10"
" I liked how serious it was
",2017-07-24 00:00:00,9,"Captain America Winter Soldier was just an amazing film: great action packed thriller. It's undoubtedly one of the best films within the Marvel Universe, but the amazing thing about Winter Soldier is that even if it wasn't a superhero movie, it will still be a really amazing movie, and one of the best action-spy-thrillers of all time. The amazing thing about Captain America is that all its movies, besides the Winter Soldier, are amazing in their own right; the same cannot be said with all of the other superhero movies within the Marvel Universe. The story was very interesting, and though it's called the ""Winter Soldier"", that character didn't really get much of a screen time for some reason unless I'm missing something. Unlike most of the other movies within the Marvel Universe, Winter Soldier is one of these movies you would see possibly again. It was entertaining for nearly the entire duration. And that's why many like this movie. The movie looked serious too, and it was important within the Marvel Universe, especially for what is to come later. It was an interesting movie."
" reviewers
",2017-06-26 00:00:00,8,"Looks like most the reviewers here either loved this movie or really hated it (The haters being highly outnumbered). And the reasons the haters hate it are...well let's just say...pathetic. Apparently some people don't understand the difference between good and evil, while others find the little things to nitpick at, like the bad guys not shooting at Cap's feet when he's running at them with his shield."
" Steve+Nat=win)
",2017-06-22 00:00:00,10,"The only complain about this movie is that action scenes are too quick. Shaking camera and too much happening in seconds makes it hard to follow..apart from that it is a...Marvellous Movie))) Streve Rodgers was not my favorite character from Avengers, until I watched this) I was always into Scarlett) Here... this is what they call an ideal action movie)) with impressive action scenes and usual Avengers stuff - the meaning and the message behind the action. So..to put it simply - this is the best Avengers action movie and probably the best action movie of 2010s)) The joyride of watching this.. and two hours swishing like 15 minutes)) Battle music, Steve being the knight of the world and Scarlett breaking me heart again that I do not have such a marvel in me life)) this is what an action movie is all about))P.S. There is a lot of praise to dramatic performance of actors in drama movies.. but still.. here.. to look so convincing in every second of action scenes like Chris and Scarlett did.. requires no less talent))"
" review
",2017-06-13 00:00:00,10,"A fantastic action packed thrill ride. The cast do an amazing job as their characters. The story grabbed my attention. The film moves along at a good pace, it kept me interested from beginning to end. The action is very good. It could be the best superhero film ever made, or one of them. I really enjoyed it."
" A Captain America movie that focuses equally on his future side-kick Winter Soldier
",2017-06-02 00:00:00,9,"This movie manages to stay out of superhero clichés and manages to be a realistic and logical action- thriller. Intro part is very attracting and casting Georges St-Pierre, one of the best MMA fighters ever, as Batroc is a very good choice. Hand-to-hand combat scenes and highway combat scenes are realistic and professional. The movie touches the theme of freedom, which is what Captain America stands for, elegantly."
" Marvel continues to ride high after the success of Avengers Assemble
",2017-05-20 00:00:00,7,"THE WINTER SOLDIER is a far superior sequel to the original Captain America: unlike the first film, this doesn't descend into a CGI mess in the second half, and instead remains tight and compelling right up to and throughout the climax. This one has a retro, '70s political thriller-type feel going on, with Chris Evans cast as a friendless figure out of his time and out of his depth, at the mercy of sinister and unknown forces.It's a decent film too, one never less than entertaining, and the second-best Marvel film I've seen, right behind AVENGERS ASSEMBLE (which had the huge budget and scale as a result). The fast-paced narrative includes all manner of martial arts-based fight scenes which, although reliant on CGI, are still exciting to watch. The elevator sequence is a real highlight and expertly staged. The effects are generally above average and the humour and camaraderie that these films are known for are both present. Scarlett Johansson shines here and Samuel L. Jackson gets more depth than usual, while Robert Redford is fun in a stock role. I wouldn't call THE WINTER SOLDIER a masterpiece, but it certainly does the job well enough and never disappoints."
" Then finish it. 'Cause I'm with you 'til the end of the line.
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,10,"When viewed in the context on the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe and the superhero genre itself, it's easy to see that the Captain America films are some of the best. The first one was a authentic war period piece from the 1940's, and now The Russo's Brothers, with their low filmmaking experience, take what the first set up and expand it to make a phenomenally film know as Captain America: The Winter Soldier.This was always my favorite one. Even when I had seen it in theaters back in 2014 I knew that this was the one I was waiting for. Not only did The Russo Brothers improve on the first but decided to make a spy thriller instead of a superhero film. That's what I think makes the film itself so good, it's ability to be a superhero film second. Their idea to make it a primary espionage film is spectacular.Both directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, The Winter Soldier is a marvel to see on screen. Their slick and darkish tone with the character of Captain America coincide perfectly. The cinematography is absolutely stunning and the visuals are brilliant. The action is shot perfectly with well choreographed fights and great editing. Along side a menacing and unique score the film is boosted up to the sky with it's technical aspects.Bringing his own flare and charismatic genius once again, Chris Evans is awesome as Captain America. He is so energetic and just feels so real. The casting is something Marvel Studios I feel always gets right. Scarlett Johansson was a great addition for Captain America as she brings her usual great moves and her spy like demeanor. Anthony Mackie, Robert Redford, Sebastian Stan, all these great actors giving their all in roles simply *made* for them. I couldn't see anyone else in their roles and their chemistry is fantastic.Some may see my rating as a bit too high, but to me it's perfect. The Avengers may be their best film but, this is my *favorite* MCU film. That's saying a lot, because I watch these films so much I lost count, I've probably seen this at least ten times. What Anthony and Joe Russo did with this and really the entire superhero genre is stunning, taking an interesting character and bringing in an unfamiliar genre to add was pure brilliance. In short, Captain America: The Winter Solider is top tier God level filmmaking and one of my favorite superhero films of all time."
" Still the best one of the MCU!
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,8,"Just rewatched Winter Soldier for the fifth or sixth time, and I still can't think of any other one of the MCU movies that works so well (at least for me), not only as a superhero movie, but as a film in general. Apart from the amazing action and great fight scenes, there's a lot of emphasis on character, personal drama and it's got just enough humour. The villains (Robert Redford's character and the Winter Soldier) are also very well written and fleshed out, and the CGI is pretty good too. The stunt work is outstanding! This is a comic book movie that not only entertains you with its cool- looking characters and spectacular action scenes, but makes you feel for the heroes (Cap, Natasha, Fury, Falcon, etc.), and keeps you on the edge of your street with the tension and the twists and turns of the story."
" Captain America loses his respect.
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,8,"Perfect pace and compelling script; with only one fault possible, maybe too much action. Anthony and Joe Russo direct this screenplay adaption of a Marvel comic by Jack Kirby and Joe Simon. Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) is brought out of suspended animation to find a much different world; one in which S.H.I.E.L.D has suffered many dark situations and Captain America himself is labeled a villain and much sought after person of interest. The plot may be spread a little thin, as someone from Steve Roger's past proves to be his major antagonist. The ""Winter Soldier"" (Sebastian Stan) will cause two of Captain America's friends from the past, Nick Fury (Samuel J. Jackson) and the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), come to the aid of the star-spangled super hero.An astute cast also features: Robert Redford, Cobie Smulders, Toby Jones, Anthony Mackie, Emily VanCamp, Maximilliano Hernandez and Stan Lee."
" Captain America: The Winter Soldier********
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,8,"Taking over the director's chair for the Captain America franchise is the Russo Brothers (Anthony Russo & Joe Russo), they did not disappoint, it was a step up from Captain America: The First Avenger, and I was a fan of the first movie. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a smart and an engaging film. A more realistic take, reducing the work of CGI to a degree in favor of some retro action. The story was suspenseful and I've gotta say, good character development as well. Chris Evans does a great job at playing the role of a good friend trying to save a good friend. Also I was very impressed with Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes/Winter Solider, along with everyone else, they did a solid job. If this is the direction, the series is headed, I'm all for it."
" Fantastic action but no lasting stakes
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,8,"So, after seeing Captain America in his first standalone film and then in The Avengers, I thought he was a decent character but wasn't completely enthralled by him.Well, things get taken up a gear in The Winter Soldier as Cap tries to deal with life in the 21st century. His old flame from the 40s is bedridden and senile, post-9/11 America starts to scare him, and ultimately he must learn to trust no one.SHIELD gets infiltrated, taking Nick Fury out of the picture, so Cap and Black Widow must fend off the Winter Soldier and the rest of the SHIELD double agents, later found out to be members of HYDRA. They must prevent Robert Redford's character; the corrupt leader of SHIELD from using heavily armed aircraft carriers to decimate the city.So, the Winter Soldier is revealed to be Bucky Barnes, Cap's childhood friend from back in the day, who coincidentally got frozen and experimented on with the same super serum as Cap. And I'm not gonna lie, he's pretty badass. The first scene we see him or when he's escaping from Cap after sniping fury, I get chills every time. He is more of a threat to Cap because of course, he is brainwashed and also, Cap doesn't want to kill his friend.Cap also befriends Sam Wilson or Falcon in this movie, and his debut entry with the mechanical wings on top of a skyscraper is possibly my favourite entry for a superhero ever.The action in this film is incredible. The pyrotechnics and combat are amazing to look at, but they're not done in a gratuitous way (like Michael Bay, for instance) The only flaw of this film is the overall lack of stakes. Yeah, sure, Robert Redford gets eliminated but that was kinda predictable. Nick Fury gets shot and is pronounced dead in hospital. Turns out he survived. Rumlow gets crushed by falling building debris. Oh no, it's OK, he's coming back for Civil War. Cap receives fatal gunshot wounds, gets beaten in the face with a metal appendage and falls about 500 feet into the middle of the ocean. Don't worry, he's fine! See what I mean? The one problem with these Marvel films is that you know deep down, they're always going to play it safe. These films are laid out on a conveyor belt after all. These actors have multi-movie contracts.Aside from that, this is my favourite Marvel movie. It mixes elements of spy thriller and action films into a superhero film and it works dividends. It has my absolute recommendation."
