" Excellent horror film.
",2021-03-25 00:00:00,8,"Great film! In some ways reminiscent of The Exorcist, this film goes from being a cop procedural to something entirely more sinister. The acting is excellent as are the special effects, though the horror elements are more psychological and supernatural rather than being based on blood and gore. I think the film is all the better for it. Genuinely disturbing in places, Deliver Us From Evil is a great take on supernatural horror and is apparently based on true events. Highly recommended for fans of supernatural horror."
" Exorcist clone mixed with buddy cop movie ( sort of )
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,10,"Decent little horror film with a good cast led by the excellent Eric Bana.
I've watched this film three times, so it must be worth a look."
" Based on a true story
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,8,"Based on a true story that's why it's an 8 from me, so it's scary enough, can it get any scarier"
" Meh.
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,5,"5 is enough for this movie. Nothing new, very similar story with other exorcist movies. Some scenes are scary."
" Truly awful
",2021-02-03 00:00:00,3,"A bad rehash of every religious horror out there, converged into one confused mess."
" Original and creepy
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,8,I loved this movie. Original storyline and some really good acting made this an edge of your seat watch. Recommended......ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ
" One of the top 5 exorcism movies I've watched!
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,9,"By far one of the best exorcism movies I've seen. There wasn't any silly scenes, there wasn't any parts to it that wasn't explained. It was done good.
The lighting could be tad better, it was hard to see in some sequences, but other than that the acting was phenomenal, the cinematography was incredible, and I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
" Worth the watch for sure
",2020-12-17 00:00:00,7,"Very entertaining.
Could have been Great!
Very good.Missing something to make it unforgettable."
" This one was difficult for me to score.
",2020-10-27 00:00:00,7,"A little over halfway into the movie I was leaning towards scoring it an 8. I was really enjoying it a lot more than I thought I would. It can be a little slow at times but the story was engaging and it had a good scare factor to it. The problem I ended up having with this film was the over the top ending. It just dragged the movie down. Ultimately, I decided to rate this one 7 stars because the first 85% of it was great. It's just too bad that the ending didn't do it justice."
" One of the most cheesy film i watched lately
",2020-10-07 00:00:00,2,I can not believe so many people gave this high rating to this film!It is absolutely overrated. Couple of jumpscare scenes and exorcism practices nothing else.
" Atmospheric horror movie with investigative elements and family drama components
",2020-09-14 00:00:00,8,"Deliver Us from Evil is a conventional supernatural horror film that still manages to convince with very good acting performances, moody atmosphere and sinister locations. The plot revolves around former soldiers and their entourage who are behaving erratically after coming home from Iraq. A dedicated special investigator who neglects his family and an unconventional priest with a sinister past join their forces to fight the evil that the soldiers have brought home from abroad.This movie oozes with atmosphere from start to finish. The diversified locations have been chosen with care. The light techniques blend in very well. The two lead characters might not be particularly sympathetic but they are certainly intriguing and have depth as well as development. The opening thirty minutes show the gloomy downsides of the difficult job of a special investigator and almost remind of a documentary. The different plot lines are brought together during the movie's gradually intensifying rising action that can be seen as the film's highlight. The climax happening at the special investigator's own home quickly develops into an intense falling action as the priest and the special investigator have to make enormous sacrifices to fight an unpredictable enemy with supernatural powers. Only the film's conclusion is shallow and predictable like many similar horror movies. The fact that the movie keeps on insisting that it's based upon facts is also ridiculous regarding the supernatural horror topic.In the end, Deliver Us from Evil might not be particularly creative or credible but it's an atmospheric supernatural horror movie with intense scenes, interesting plot lines and profound characters. Genre fans should definitely know this film and even those who usually dislike horror movies might like this one due to its investigative elements and family drama components. Deliver Us from Evil is unjustifiably underrated and one of the better atmospheric horror movies in recent memory."
" Good story about fighting evil.
",2020-07-30 00:00:00,6,"The theme of exorcism and the human obsession with evil spirits is played up from all sides in world cinema. Director and screenwriter Scott Derrickson has already shot a theme movie (""The Exorcism of Emily Rose""). The film is based on the book by American police officer Ralph Sarchi ""Beware the Night"". Eric Bana plays the main role, and he looks very appropriate as a police officer. Edgar Ramirez plays a priest, a former drug addict. ""Deliver Us from Evil"" is a horror, mystery thriller and detective story. The authors have mixed too many genres. There are a frightening atmosphere, action, a detective part, and a police action movie. This mixture looks interesting but has not been properly assembled. But overall, this is a good story about fighting evil."
" Based on the truth !! Your kidding
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,3,"There's a few moments that have some tension but all they ever needed to do was switch the lights on !!
It has a policeman who carries 6"" knives and happily throws them around and a good looking priest to save the moment!!
Oh !! Not to forget the unhappy home life with the main character.
Overall it's all just a bit obvious"
" Based on a True Story?
",2020-06-18 00:00:00,4,"So opening the film, the words that the film is based on the true accounts of a sergeant quickly piqued my interest. Disappointingly however, the film begins to take bizarre turns further on, which leads to an extremely tedious, unoriginal, and indeed unbelievable work of fiction.Almost everything here is a work of fiction, and by having the name of the author of the book as the main character DOES NOT make it real if it does not follow the story he told. This is like making a film about Winston Churchill, portraying him as the foot soldier who singlehandedly won the war. Everything from this film deviated far from the accounts of the story it's based on, and to have the words suggest it is based on it is incredibly misleading.Asides from that, the film is pure unoriginal nonsense, which gets more and more bizarre as the film progresses. It was interesting enough initially, however it doesn't take long for this film to turn into an action-packed fantasy full of nonsensical storylines."
" Oh yeah
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,7,Oh yeah!!! This movie is amazing. Tension in every scene
" Scary as Hell!!
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,10,"Its been a long time since I'd seen a movie of terror. Wow!! Excelent story tekking, script, special effects and everthing else.
It graps you to your seat till the end!!.
Outrageously Excelent show.
Congrats Eric Bana did not dissapoint!"
" This was... strange!
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,5,I just happened to came across this movie. Random watch you can say. I really found it kind of strange. The climax scenes were a little better but then all of a sudden it ended! It is an average movie. Also saw here on IMDB that it won 2 awards! Really!!! Again a strange thing.
" Movie with an religious agenda
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,3,It started fine similar to most horror thrillers but as it proceeds it becomes more preaching... It becomes unbearably preachy when the Jesuit priest had more authority than a police in a psych hospital without any proper training... then he started talking against abortion after impregnating another druggie... Terrible.
" Eric Bana's and Sean Harris' performances are what makes this movie a clichÃ©d but very memorable horror possession/ buddy cop horror
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,8,"Though I do not know what the true story was, the poster made it look like a clichÃ©d possession horror. However, it is a good thing that this seemingly clichÃ©d possession horrors added other clichÃ©s with brilliant performances from Eric Bana and Sean Harris (as the villain). Edgar Ramirez had great chemistry with Bana, and is intriguing all the way through. Bana's Ralph Sarchie is a grizzled cop, like in most movies (Ramirez's character pokes fun at that), but he has depth to his character, making him more relatable than conventional police characters. Moreover, the stakes become personal in the end, making the exorcism at the end more climactic. The plot is like a cat and mouse game between the police and a possessed person. The cinematography is decent, and employs different techniques to create tension and fear. This helps make the horror grounded, and prevents the movie from straying into action movie territory. Moreover, I constantly had to look everywhere in case there was something hidden. The scares were effective, and how they provided a basis for the strange sounds Bana's character hears makes the movie rewarding to watch. I actually enjoy the movie, and though the ending was a bit too conventional."
" Deliver us from sheer boredom
",2020-03-14 00:00:00,2,"This has to be one of the most boring, unpalatable movies i have ever seen! Nothing but an amateurish and thoroughly unsuccessful attempt at copying from various horror movies."
" Enjoyed it, but.....
",2020-02-22 00:00:00,7,"... Could have enjoyed it more without the superfluous references To The Doors. They added absolutely nothing to what was a well told, well acted film. There seemed no reason for them to be there, had the director just decided he wanted their music in his film, and had to shoehorn them in somehow? Apart from that, very enjoyable."
" Same old cliches...what a waste of time
",2020-02-22 00:00:00,2,"I like Eric Bana...but here he's made a terrible mistake. A cliched script as old as the hills...we've seen all this before...so nothing new or inspiring at all. It amazes me how anyone can get a film like this financed...(Jerry Bruckheimer no less..!)....but even more, that half decent actors can choose to make this garbage....please don't waste your time....I've wasted if for you..!"
" Formulaic but entertaining
",2020-02-14 00:00:00,6,"I really enjoyed this when first seeing it remember having no expectations and it was my friend's birthday and it was the midnight show. Well the movie certainly hasn't aged well or maybe it was never that great to begin with. Following the supposedly true story of a New York Cop/Priest detective team who find themselves investigating a supernatural possession case involving veterans that encountered a dark presence while on tour in the middle east. The movie has some decent shocks but its fairly by the numbers. The performances are a mixed bag but both Eric Bana and Edgar Ramirez as the team are both sexy and likable. The movies pacing feels a little all over the place but the final, gory exorcism is successful if a little expected. All in all it's a little bit of a missed opportunity but still fairly entertaining."
" The jump scares ruined it for me.
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,2,"This is the first review I've ever written for a movie. It was that bad.The movie itslef wasn't horrible, but the jump scares were so obvious and bad that it started to get annoying. When the movie got quiet and started focusing in on something, jump scare incoming.
I don't even know why I watched till the end.
Save your time and don't watch this.
I decided to watch this because of the surprising amount of good user reviews but regretted it. I don't understand how this many people can give this something more than 5 stars."
" It's not THAT bad , one time watchable ( E+ Movie) My Ratings 6/10
",2020-02-01 00:00:00,6,"Very real, based on real life story, and if you have had encounters with spirits then this makes sense"
" Great leads, but bland and predictable
",2020-01-29 00:00:00,4,"After a strong beginning and getting to know the protatonists, the plot soon comes down to the usual slimy blubbering demons who love funny voices and to rant and rave in Latin (why are they always so educated?) and the one and only good people in the world (Roman Catholic priests - seriously lol?) fighting them with fire, brimstone and melodramatic posturing.The worst demon finally (most slimy, dirty and grimy) is called Jungler. Can you believe it? As the boring ending is only about the leads pompously reciting Bible quotes and throwing their hands meaningfully in the air, this one actually had me chuckling.What is that demons story or mission? We never get to know, except that it originates from Iraq, so of course it loves to invade American homes.The protagonists never rise above the level of stock characterizations (the handsome but tormented young rebel priest who got saved by Catholicism, the tough but sensitive cop whose biggest mistake in life was to kill a serial child murderer instead of letting him marsh to his death sentence), and while the dialogues are well written, they never get very meaningful either, and in the end it turns into one big ad for the Catholic church who fights evil (read slimy stinky things lurking in the dark). Great. Did the Vatican finance this?So why did I watch it till the end? First, the detailed, nuanced photography and sets are great and a pleasure to watch. Second, the two male leads are not only a pleasure to watch, but also to observe in how these two actors masterfully breathe air into their dull characters. Great craftsmanship.But, I really would not recommend it otherwise. Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer - so you should know what to expect."
" Unexpectedly Predictable
",2020-01-27 00:00:00,5,"Right off the bat, our main character does questionable police work and that really turned me off from enjoying the film. An example is when he demanded to enter an enclosure in the zoo when chasing a suspect without thinking if there are any animals in it; and as expected, the suspect is gone and he was greeted by grumpy lions. This isn't the only instance where he does things without thinking, when questioning a possessed and possibly violent lady about something, our main character sticks his arm in her cell to show her pictures from his phone; again, as expected, the possessed lady bit him. His wife is also somewhat annoying, dismissing their daughter's fear without further investigating anything. The film could've had potential but the characters were written poorly.Anyway, for the positive part. The cinematography, visuals and audio were great and I enjoyed almost everything else, except for the way the characters are written.No offence to the real Ralph Sarchie and other characters."
" Overly talkative and not particularly scary or thrilling
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,2,"New York police officer Ralph Sarchie (Eric Bana) begins investigating a series of crimes and as he delves deeper he becomes concerned when some of those responsible for the crimes are exhibiting strange behaviour. Believing that the man responsible for the killings is possessing his subjects Ralph, with the assistance of a priest sets about trying to hunt down the killer and perform an exorcism on him in order to put an end to his reign of terror...Although it's based on a true story, I have to admit that I found Deliver us from evil to be a bit of a slog to get through and despite the subject matter being interesting in and of itself I have to admit that this film did not grip or engage me in the way I'd hoped it would...I found the film to be slow and felt that the film was far too talky and despite running at close to 2 hours not a great deal happened. It improves a little bit when we learn who's doing the killings and why, but prior to this reveal the film suffers major pacing problems. I actually paused the film at one point with 30 minutes to go and I swear it felt like I had been watching it for hours.Another thing that works against the film is that it doesn't really have any particularly compelling or interesting characters. Now I don't mean any disrespect to the real Ralph Sarchie, but the way he's portrayed in this film made him seem a bit bland. The priest character came off as being more ridiculous than anything and the other characters failed to make much of an impression on me at all (although the lovely Olivia Munn at least provided some distraction).The acting is mixed with some fairing better than others. Bana seems to sleepwalk through the film and as mentioned his character never really engaged with me. Everyone else is so-so with no-one really standing out as being great.Overall then I found Deliver us from evil to be long, talky and quite boring. It comes to life slightly towards the end, but truth be told that final scene was the only part of the film that I thought was any good."
" Brilliant.
",2019-12-29 00:00:00,10,"I really enjoyed this movie. I had the pleasure of seeing this gem in theater over 5 years ago. Just rewatched it. Watching it for the second rime, was far better than the first."
" EXCELLENT & SCARY AS HELL!!!
",2019-12-18 00:00:00,7,"WOW TERRIFYING!!!
This was like NYPD meets Evil Dead,
Truly nerve shredding intense scares & an excellent performance by the way underrated ERIC BANA, who is still my favourite HULK.The New York City in this terrifying supernatural Horror Thriller is rain dreched Gloomy & dreary & gives it a very creepy atmosphere that's always there!!! The colours seemed muted & dark to go with the tone of dread, there's a real old school 90's gritty feel to this movie in ways abit like the 90's Denzel Washington supernatural Cop Thriller ""Fallen"" which is another great film.
I loved the fact Eric Bana plays a tough & angry cop, he's messed up emotionally because of what he's seen being a cop in a city of sin, he even says a fantastic line to his wife ""I walk through the sewer every night, i dont wanna do it again when i come home with you"" a powerful bit of dialogue!!!
Eric Bana gives an excellent layered & tormented performance as veteran detective Sarchie, you even find that this tough gritty cop beat to death a vile child molesting serial killer & i loved seeing it as i agree that child abusers should be killed!!!
It's an intense performance & great piece of acting i loved Eric Bana in this dark role but also another superb performance came from the priest he teams up with ""Mendoza"" played by Edgar Ramirez, he was very intense on screen & worked greatly with bana, also British actor Sean Harris was absolutely terrifying & mesmerising as the possessed ex-soldier turned killer demon ""Santino"" & Eric Bana's Cop partner Jimmy was really cool played by Chris Coy, a superb cast.""Deliver Me U Evil"" is a truly SCARY Horror Thriller that takes us from War torn Iraq to the rainy darkness of a creepy New York City & mixes ""Exorcist"" type Horror with gritty Cop Thriller, the gore looks scarily raw & real & disturbing as hell, this is definitely one of the scariest possession type films of that genre & it's totally entertaining & interesting,
Like i said the city mainly ""The Bronx"" is seen as a very gloomy wet & enclosed place full of old creepy house's & buildings, everything looks old & run down & decaying & nothing looks very posh or smart, i also got vibes of the excellent but underrated 1999 Schwarzenegger satanic supernatural Thriller ""End of Days"" both encased a very dark, gloomy & atmospheric New York City that felt very claustrophobic.
This is an excellent & very well made movie & it's genuinely scary as hell & has fantastic cinematography too.
Also it's based on a true events so even more terrifying"
" Very good horror flick
",2019-12-18 00:00:00,8,I'm a huge movie geek and got into horrors about 18 months ago so I'm trying to watch every horror movie and so far out the huge amount I've watched this is one of my favourites it definetly scares you and the cast was brilliant a must see for the horror lovers
" Atmosphere is there, but that's it
",2019-12-07 00:00:00,5,"I was looking forward to seeing this as I liked director Scott Derricksons Sinister a lot, I thought it was one of the better horror movies I'd seen in a while. Dr. Strange wasn't bad either.The movie starts out with a scene from Iraq war, a few American soldiers find something in a cave/crypt or so, but the scene cuts pretty short and we move on to New York City.The atmosphere, cinematography etc is good. Very Se7en style, dark and rainy metropolis, Eric Bana seems like a fit choice for a troubled cop with kind of a sixth sense, which his colleague calls radar. They follow a few leads concerning for example domestic violence and a strange event at the zoo. There seems to be a connection to the soldiers we saw in the beginning. Eric Bana's ""radar"" seems to connect to things supernatural, he hears and sees what other don't. A priest also appears and sooner or later it looks like they are dealing with some kind of possessed individual rather than just ex-soldier.While the style indeed is creepy and atmospheric, the story itself never really kicks off or gets very interesting, we never get to know why anything really happens other than that a soldier somehow gets possessed by the devil in Iraq and starts terrorizing. The back story is too thin to properly engage.Eric Bana as Sarchie has ok charisma, but mostly the acting is super wooden in scenes where they would've needed some more beef. Especially the priest delivers a lacklustre performance.We also have Sarchies family and they naturally get in danger, which mostly include a few very cliched horror movie scenes which could basically be from any horror movie (kid goes to sleep, hears strange noises, toys move by themselves, door closes with a slam).The movie has a few pretty strong images, a twisted body of a suicide jumper and the exorcism scene is quite intense.I never figured out the The Doors music how it connected to anything. I had to watch the beginning with very low volume tho so maybe I missed something, but if not, I think it was more comical than spooky.Nothing memorable really and worse than Sinister."
" The way it should be Done
",2019-11-30 00:00:00,9,"Gritty, filled with scares and action combined with solid acting from all involved, a scary movie doesn't get better than this!"
" Innovative
",2019-11-04 00:00:00,7,"Considering a genre where pretty much everything seems to be done already, Deliver us from Evil brings at least in parts new and innovative aspects to possession themed movies. The combination of authentic cop meets spiritual challenge is entertaining and well executed. The final minutes however I found very cliche (slow mo, tears etc). DufE has a few shocking scenes however the majority is more on the creepy side and subtle which is a wise move. What I also liked was the limited use of special effects as it underlines the realistic impression."
" TRUST ME...WORTH THE WATCH
",2019-11-04 00:00:00,7,This was a pretty good movie! I don't think I heard of it! Was in need of watching a movie worth my attention at night! I felt like the movie was well balanced all around! It definitely kept my eyes glued to the screen! Worth the watch
" Which is it?
",2019-10-15 00:00:00,5,The entire time I watched this movie I couldn't help but feel like the writer couldn't decide if he wanted to make a horror movie or a buddy cop movie and settled for both knowing either or would have been poor. Jumping between solid police work and then searching for answers to unravel a mystery involving demons plaguing marines made the whole experience feel disjointed and not super well thought out. An interesting story without a doubt and well acted by all involved just in the end let down by a seemingly directionless idea of what the movie was actually supposed to be genre-wise.
" For something so evil, it's good
",2019-10-07 00:00:00,5,"Oh wow, where was this little gem hiding, took me by surprise I was expecting a run of the mill 'OK' horror but got 'The Exorcist' meets 'Se7en' gem of goodness...I'm not a religious person but this gets you thinking, great story from start to finish and some amazing acting, slightly on the long side but worth it"
" No
",2019-09-24 00:00:00,2,I wouldn't have gotten through this if it weren't for Eric Bana.
" Decent
",2019-09-10 00:00:00,7,"I have seen a lot of ""exorcist like"" films, but this one had a great story."
" Loved it! Great story line!
",2019-09-05 00:00:00,8,Awesome movie! Another great movie with Eric Bana! It really has a good story line and enjoyed every second of it.
" Not what I expected at all.
",2019-09-03 00:00:00,9,"I don't know why I was expecting something bad. I've watched so many horror films, that my expectations have plummeted. I loved this, absolutely brilliant, dare I say it, it's even a bit on the scary side.It's a slick, well paced, action packed horror thriller, with some nail biting scenes and uneasy moments. Yes there there are some of the stereotypes, there is the dishy Catholic priest, there is the endless Latin chanting, and there is a lot of biting. Forget all of that, it's terrific.Great acting, especially Sean Harris, he pretty much stands out. I loved it."
" Brilliant Possession movie!
",2019-08-30 00:00:00,9,"Could be the most authentic demonic possession movie I've seen since watching The Exorcist. As a practicing Catholic this is a favourite sub-genre of horror for me. And I am also a devout follower of scary movies lol. Exorcism was always a bit of a mystery for me so it was a learning experience about the ritual and phases and the power of the Cross. And true to the facts about demons they can only enter into our world through gateways and those who are susceptible. Woe to the unlucky who stumble upon such gateways. What made the movie even more authentic was that it was based on facts. And it is a fact that the devil is real, without trying to sound too preachy."
" Good: 7.0
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,7,"Scott Derrickson's previous film, Sinister, was one that I hold in very high regard. It had a great story, haunting visuals, and terrific sound design. His next horror project, the police drama/Exorcist hybrid Deliver Us From Evil, does not reach the high mark set by its predecessor. But it is a suitably entertaining, if heavily cliched, horror adventure that should provide a fix for genre fans parched by the lack of scary movies this summer. The events that unfold are inspired by the experiences of real-life former NYPD sergeant Ralph Sarchie, who served as an associate producer on the project. And while certain aspects are undoubtedly Hollywooded up for the silver screen (the final scene in particular, though thoroughly mesmerizing, requires a much higher suspension of disbelief than others), the cop side of the film mostly helps to keep the other half grounded in reality. But despite this, as well as raw and unyielding performances from Eric Bana and Edgar Ramirez, the cliches hanging out almost everywhere drag the film down, rendering it merely passable, if well-crafted."
" Not great
",2019-05-08 00:00:00,5,"It had great casting and really interesting characters, but it shoots itself in the foot because it ends up with no explanations, I think this movie tries to pass itself off as a true story, straying away from the horror genre and categorizing it as Christian propaganda, which is not my cup of tea. On an up note, there were a lot of creepy moments which made me shiver a little, but still it could have used a lot more, but again this is not that kind of film."
" Very good horror film
",2019-04-22 00:00:00,9,"Actually, my review should be more about the other reviews then the actual film. I don't understand how some people can give this film a 10 star rating while others give it a meager 1 to 3. Especially when they complain about the lack of originality. That is a bloody joke. When Spielberg made his 1975 Jaws movie, it was a first where the big white shark got center stage. So of course it was a one off. By now, after another 20, 30 or 50 shark films it's going to be difficult to add something new. The shark can become bigger or smarter, but the action will still have to be along the same line. The same goes for the horror, possession films. After the exorcist it's going to be difficult to come up with something ""original"". I thought that this film was very well done. The acting was convincing and ""believable"". I don't know about the based on real events. probably just to add some extra flavor I suppose. I gladly give this film a 9 star rating, just to leave some space. I truly enjoyed watching it."
" It's better than I thought
",2019-04-16 00:00:00,7,"I stumbled upon this on Amazon Prime and thought why not. I like Eric Bana and Joel McHale so what can go wrong.I honestly thought it was quite good. I thought there was a few horror cliches, the wife of Ralph was annoying and thought the end sequence went on longer than it needed to, but I liked it.Acting was great from both main actors. I didn't know how Joel McHale would do in a horror considering he does a lot of comedy, but it worked. It's set in the modern day, which I much prefer, and neither cops immediately believe that what's going on is linked to demons and religion etc which is more realistic. There's a few jump scares, but not too many where it becomes overkill. The plot overall is decent as well, just overall worth a watch in my opinion."
" I fully rated that
",2019-04-16 00:00:00,6,"Took me by surprise at how good this was. I let jumper scared me a lot of times and freaked me out.
However his partner dying was such an uneeded part of the film and he got over it so quickly. If my best mate died it would take months to get over, took him a day. The film also went on for a little bit longer then it should have."
" Loved it
",2019-02-22 00:00:00,8,One of the greatest horrors these days but I guess I'm gonna delete the doors from my playlist for a while
" Not Bad!
",2019-01-11 00:00:00,6,"This movie contain good story
I think this movie not great but not bad."
" Sean Harris was at his best in this.
",2018-11-02 00:00:00,6,"Really good watch, if you're not into your conventional possession horrors. It has a dramatic twist that for me, is welcome anytime when evil is vanquished. Sean Harris was something else in this. Worth a watch."
" A buddy cop horror that ends up being super fun!
",2018-09-14 00:00:00,8,"I personally love this movie. It's fun, interesting, and delivers tension & atmosphere from beginning to end.The plot is nothing overly special, but has enough genuine twists and turns to keep you on your toes, and is executed well. What we get is a buddy cop flick crossing paths with an exorcism flick, and I think most people will be surprised at how well this works, giving us a fresh take on a brand of horror that has been done over and over again with varying amounts of success.The acting is more than decent, and is probably the element that makes this movie so enjoyable. A horror movie starring Eric Bana & Joel McHale probably doesn't sound like anything very high value, but it really makes for a fun ride, and the down time between the tension wass more than enough to keep my attention. Are the characters and dialogue a bit cliche? Yes. But they execute it seamlessly to a point where I didn't care. Scares followed suit, with the villain toeing the line between supernatural entity and psychopathic killer.The movie looks and sounds great, and hits a sweet spot between thriller and horror, as we end up in a game of cat and mouse with a supernatural entity, culminating in one of the best exorcism scenes I think I've ever seen.Fans of horror and even thriller fans (as long as you don't mind getting scared), this one's too fun to miss out on."
" V Good Demon Movie

" Horror that I like (positive ending)!
",2018-08-05 00:00:00,8,"I generally don't watch horror movies, but if I do I like the ones which end positively. The movie Deliver us from Evil is quite methodical in its approach and I am not condemning it. In fact I like that. May be because, it's the only one of its type that I have seen. I want to highlight something; the movie explains the Exorcism to be carried out in six stages. To be frank in a movie the approach looks nice. The harsh reality is it never turns out that well. Despite that I have faith in supernatural beings working. It is because, in a given kind of similar situation was one of my friends, he vomited out the matter the way it is shown in Exorcism (1973). He never had something similar to eat. However he is now at peace with modern meds.Final Verdict: A methodical treat on exorcism with positive ending. I enjoyed watching it and I have faith so will you."
" Initially engaging but falls short as time goes on
",2018-07-10 00:00:00,6,"Filmmaker Scott Derrickson has definitely been through a lot when it comes to movies even if he hasn't output a large volume. He's also been through several areas of the movie industry; everything from home video, independent to mainstream blockbuster studios. And of course now that he's been inducted into the family of Marvel Studios, his credibility has been more or less confirmed. Prior to this though he was still trying to make a name for himself in way that would make him stand out. While The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008) remake was boring for most, his comeback with Sinister (2012) turned the tables in his favor. While Sinister (2012) did engage its audience at the beginning, the predictability became fairly obvious as time went on. Sadly it seems as though Derrickson did not notice this when he released this movie as his next feature.The story for this movie displays events that allegedly were told to be true by a New York police officer named Ralph Sarchie. According to him, he came across a number of strange moments where he would be on duty and witness abnormal actions by people. Playing Sarchie is Eric Bana and soon he teams up with a priest by the name of Father Mendoza (Edgar RamÃ­rez) who believes the cases are related to a greater evil. With the screenplay adapted by Derrickson and Paul Harris Boardman, the execution of the story feels very similar to that of Sinister (2012). At the start, the plot will capture the viewers' attention, but over time it begins to lose its grasp on what matters most. This is unfortunate because initially it has an interesting detective supernatural vibe going for it, but then it turns to a rather conventional method of execution and begins to lose traction.And there's a reason why the play out to this feature feels similar. The explanation to this is that Paul Harris Boardman has been a familiar writer to that of other Scott Derrickson productions, surprisingly not Sinister (2012) though. Putting this aside however, the acting by the main cast is fairly good. Eric Bana as the tough Sgt. Sarchie has a captivating presence along with his partner Butler played by Joel McHale, who seems to find a way of making light of any situation. Olivia Munn is also involved as Sarchie's wife who adds some tension to the story being that most married protagonists are easily held as leverage. Edgar Ramirez as Father Mendoza has a peculiar back story working with the supernatural and also serves as a good backup to Sarchie. Lastly there's Sean Harris who plays a significant part to the plot, and Sarchie's investigation.The visuals to the film were properly placed. Derrickson has done horror films before and this one does not divert from what's been done before. The gore is not over the top but can get grotesque.at times. This makes for an effective take on just how bad things can get surrounding Sgt. Sarchie. The worst it gets is body contortions and really freaky looking faces. The special effects themselves though are well done. There's no areas in the run time that look heavily edited or overly fake. Though some of the events that happen are questionable as to if they actually happened at all. Of course this comes with the understanding that certain liberties will be taken with the story that was given from the original source. The question is, exactly how much of it is true? That's to be debated over since the screenplay is based off of a book by Sgt. Sarchie.The camerawork was well done too. Filmed by Scott Kevan, the cinematography is displayed competently. There are dark areas throughout the film but it is not to a point where the audience will not be able to see what is happening. If anything it helps emphasize how peculiar some scenarios get. Occasionally there is some shaky cam and dutch angles, but it occurs quite infrequently that it's not really a bother. Kevan was also the cinematographer to Cabin Fever (2002), Death Race (2008) and The Darkest Hour (2011). Composing the film score to this feature was Christopher Young who has not only worked with Derrickson before but has done many horror scores in general. Sadly, what's only heard here are repeated tracks from other movies like Sinister (2012), and the rest are all stings. It's pretty underwhelming because only a couple areas actually sound unique.Music and story execution is unfortunately a large portion why the movie could not be as good as it presents itself. Yet the actors, horror visuals and premise make the view enjoyable to watch for the most part. It's decent enough to warrant at least one watch but that's it."
" Absolute Amazing
",2018-06-08 00:00:00,10,"From the beginning to the end filled with thrill
an absolute must watch!"
" Is everybody in?
",2018-05-13 00:00:00,8,"If you haven't guessed it, this is another exorcism film...which is real, but isn't. The film starts out as a a number of different tales. A group of soldiers go into an Afghan (?) tunnel only to find... We then switch to Special police officer Ralph Sarchie (Eric Bana) who uses his radar to select certain cases. He gets involved in a domestic dispute, then an odd scene at the Bronx zoo, only be followed by a family who claims their house is haunted. As he gathers evidence, everything ties to together leading of course to the expected climax with Father Mendoza (Ã‰dgar RamÃ­rez) named for the Mendoza line.Sarchie has wife issues who claims, ""Even when you're here you're not here."" Ouch! What guy hasn't heard that one before. I believe that is something they teach girls when they split us up into those special separate classes. I wish they had worked on the dialogue. Also the film was a bit long. They needed to take out 10-15 minutes.What I really liked about the film is that the demon is a big fan of Jim Morrison and quotes him while the film plays Doors music.Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" Great movie
",2018-03-21 00:00:00,8,Really enjoyable creepy movie. Well acted with a good story that plays out very well. I wouldn't say it was a horror movie but it still will give you a few jumps.
" Way better than expected
",2017-11-15 00:00:00,7,"Based on the 2001 book Beware the Night by Ralph Sarchie and Lisa Collier Cool, this film claims that it was inspired by the actual accounts of an NYPD sergeant, a throwback to 1970's Satanic film. Directed by Scott Derrickson (Dr. Strange, Sinister), it's a stylish modern take on those films and their various tropes.Where those 70's shockers dealt with the spectre of Vietnam and society's changing views of religion, this film takes the PTSD afflicted survivors of Iraq and posits occult reasons for their suicidal and murderous urges. NYPD office Raphie Sarchie (Eric Bana, Hulk) and partner Butler (Joel McHale, Community) work the dangerous streets of the 46th precinct, a place where the veteran office recounts finding dead infants in dumpsters and real-life horror in every alley.A domestic disturbance call brings them into the world of Jimmy Tratner, a marine that has beaten his wife and whose home has scratch marks all over it. They assume that the man is on drugs or has gone insane as they make an arrest.Before they get a chance to rest, they're called to the Bronx Zoo, where a woman literally threw her son to the lions. The power is down, a stranger painter has released the lions that he talks to and the woman scratches at the ground reciting lyrics from The Doors (an interesting inclusion due to the witchcraft behind their lyrics, such as the inversion of Morrison's name to Mr. Mojo Risin and the Boys from Brazil urban legend of multiple Morrisons being alive all at the same time).The woman from the zoo is transferred to a mental health facility and her family asks that a Jesuit named Mendoza help, which leads to us learning that Ralph has issues with religion.Another call to a house where a family will not leave the living room leads to a possessed basement where that woman's husband, David Griggs, was a painter. His dead body â€” filled with maggots and flies â€” emerges from a wall in a great scare. They learn that Santino, a Marine commander, was the painter at the zoo. This scene is rich with occult imagery â€” strange voices, lightbulbs being instantly extinguished and static coming from the police band.As Ralph gets deeper into the case, he discovers hidden owl iconography, Doors lyrics and more static at each crime scene. There are some effective slices of gruesomeness here, such as the look of Santino and strange bursts of gore, like a crucified cat. And the horror has followed him home, haunting his daughter.After deciding to work with Mendoza, they learn that Ralph has an instinctive radar for the dark side. The three men track Santino and Jimmy. The former overcomes and kills Butler (who did not die in the original cut of the film) and the latter is stopped by the power of a crucifix.Santino escapes, taking Ralph's wife and daughter hostage. An exorcism is performed and all works out fine, including Ralph's return to the Catholic faith as he baptizes his second child.Deliver Us from Evil suggests the start of a new Insidious style franchise, which didn't happen, but still leaves us with a modern take on The Exoricst. It's more stylish and somewhat better than you'd expect, which has led to frequent rewatching in the B and S About Movies household. That says volumes, as most modern horror is barely mentioned in this homestead!Read more at http://bit.ly/2hDnwpo"
