" Pretty Darn Good Movie.
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,8,"A Russia Ukraine production before they went to war, this movie is pretty darn good.I'm impressed with very decent graphics similar to the movie Pearl Harbor.It's also very interesting to watch WWII from a communist persepective.While there very well be propaganda embedded in this movie, it is a true story and unknown to this viewer up until now. All movies have a certain amount of propaganda, so I dismiss those critics.I assumed it would be similar to Enemy At The Gates. It was not. The only similarity is that both movies are about Snipers. Life as a Russian soldier and the strife is well depicted.This movie concentrated on the real life memoirs of Lyudmila Pavlichenko. The acting is very good throughout as well as the scenery.Although the subtitles are a little small, one is able to understand it well.Battle for Sevastopol is a movie worth watching again and I will."
" Too much computer graphics
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,5,"What I love about this film is Julia Peresild acting. However, the plot is very far from the real life story of Liudmila. What I particularly do not like is modern computer graphics. Also German soldiers are shown as stupid people and this is simply not true. The enemy was strong well trained and perfectly equipped. Rather than watching this film I recommend to read Liudmila biography written by herself as she was writing her diary during the war. Liudmila is extraordinary woman. RIP"
" caopletelly waste of time
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,1,Pathetic crap all this movie. Its so predictable and so lame. Its a usual russian flick about some super crazy people in WW2
" Is there any German film showing the German point of view?
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,3,"Since many years now, you can't even count the numbers of films presenting the Russian or Allies point of view in the WW2. I am not a good accountant enough to be sure. ALWAYS in the same line: PROPAGANDA CRAP. It would be interesting to let those who lost the war to present their point of view too, no? Do not forget that Germans - nazis - invaded USSR in order to slave or exterminate the population, but those men were also the best soldiers in the world. thety lost because they were lead by a lunatic who was a lousy military technician and also because they succombed under the number of Russian and US huge, huge warfare equipment and number of troops. So, i am sick of all those films showing always the same stuff, unbearable crap. Sick."
" Good, but not what I expected.
",2020-08-18 00:00:00,6,"'Battle for Sevastopol' is not what I expected. I suppose the mood you're in when watching the film will determine whether you like it or not. From a war movie perspective I was disappointed. The film has too much talk and too little action for a war movie. During the third act, it becomes more of a love story than an action war film.From an emotional perspective, though, this was incredible, as it chronicles the life of a woman who had a military upbringing - to a certain extent - thanks to her dad. It was expected of her to join the army and she excelled. Despite being a sniper, she is an ordinary woman with feelings, emotions and love. She gets hurt and emotional when those around her perish.For the Russians, she was a war hero. For the Germans, she was a villain. From a neutral perspective, its rather disconcerting calling a sniper a hero. In the end, every war hero is a nothing more than a cold blooded killer in a way - thanks to men in suits in offices declaring war. Here, the Germans are the bad guys, but in every war there are two sides to the story, and ultimately all soldiers really are just ordinary guys.'Battle for Sevastopol' is a well made film. It is a bit slow moving and somehow a female lead in a war movie just doesn't work for me. It's not the type of war movie I'd watch again and again, but I enjoyed it as a once off watch."
" Soviet propaganda strikes back
",2020-08-06 00:00:00,5,"With a little help of a romance and a very mediocre entertaining we've got a semi-real story of the best Soviet sniper-woman. It's far from real life (as historians proved that she was lying about her life many times) and it's full of Soviet propaganda - only Soviet/Russians were real victims of II World War, only they were brave and only they have to take losses. Watch it, but be aware of it."
" powerful
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,10,"The production is attentive, the actors perform well, and the ending paragraph is simple but meaningful, and the whole is very powerful"
" Agonizing and painful to watch
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,3,"A few years back someone had asked me to download the movie for him and I have had it on me ever since but never bothered to watch it since I always had dozens of movies on the 'To-watch' waiting list. I remember the time I played it after downloading it and something about the movie just did not feel right. I should have listened to my gut feeling and never watched it. Its pure agonizing watch for 2 long endless hours.I have watched most war movies and I can honestly say that this is without doubt one of the worst war movies ever made. The only thing watchable about the movie is the lead lady who is extremely beautiful and literally nothing else. This is the kind of movie that talented aspiring movie makers make in their summer vacation on a shoe-string budget. Its hard to describe in words how bad it is. You have to watch it yourself to fathom the depth of ineptness of the director. The war scenes are the same quality that someone with a camcorder would shoot in their backyard. There is this one scene were I was left wondering if it was a training scene or the war has actually begun. It took me a while to realize that its not a mock drill but actual war. The directors idea of war here is just some people running down a hill far far away.Its just bad bad bad. I dont know if the movie is based on an actual individual but if it is then it is an insult to the individual. Simply put its a mockery of movie-making. There is this one scene where the Germans send their best sniper to take down the protagonist Lyuda and he aims at a stationary target and misses. Its like they made up the story as they went along. Its like a budget version of a budget version of Enemy at the Gates. That is the last time I am taking recommendations from the individual who recommended this. There is a TV movie called Sahara starring Jim Belushi that is atleast ten times better made than this tragedy. If you are looking for decent Russian war movies then I would recommend the movie, Beast.Just a dreadful dreadful movie. Its the kind of movie that spoils your day."
" powerful movie
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,8,"The production is excellent, the actors perform well, and the cruelty and authenticity of the war and the destruction of the human spirit are both delicate and shocking, which triggers people's reflection on the war and thinking about human nature. All of them can be regarded as excellent works. The film truly reproduces the cruelty of war through the perspective of an ordinary woman. It also exposes the good and evil of human nature from the war and satirizes the national war machine."
" I like the history, but not the English title for this film
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,6,"The story mainly about Ludmilla, not the Battle in Sevastopol. I think the original title is a lot suitable.
The character build up is quite good but the intensity and the thrill become less because of the story timeline.
Overall is a good movie to watch."
" Every Russuan war movie the soldiers are supermen..
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,3,"Why is in EVERY Russian warmovie the Russian almost a super soldier? Taking a lot of bullets and then still survive,while they ALWAYS get the German with one shot. This movie is so full of BS,like all the previous Russian war movies, like White Tiger,T34,Stalingead...
The scene where 1 Polikarpov I-16 fighter takes on 4 (or so) Bf-109's is another example of how full of non sense these movies are. That fighter was already outdated when war broke out,no way it could have beaten 4 modern fighters ( for that time ofcourse) and gotten away with it unscratched. The last scene is so hard to not laugh...She stands up with no weapon in her hands,yet she still kills the German sniper who already had her in her sight! I mean common,you people try to make a war movie or a parody?
If you want to see a GOOD sniper movie hell,go watch the first Sniper or even watch American Sniper. At least those movies show a bit more reality then this joke of a movie. 3 out of 10 is still too high for this comedy...."
" Political untrue.
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,2,"This could have been a great war drama but instead the director choose the political biased story. Why is this movie has such a good rating ? I assume it has something to do with Russian troll farms, because it's kinda suck. I would be curious to compare how many of those who rated this above 7 are coming from Russia."
" Very emotional. A personal quest for love mostly.
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,10,"This is a romanticized version of a story of a very great woman. Rather that watch her kill 309+ Germans we see only couple of dozen. Men fall for her all around, but not by bullets. It is a great heroic story on and off the battlefield. I loved it. It is not the best production and there are glitches and confusion of story but it is great, and will stay with for more that a few dark nights. Enemy at the Gates is more slick, but Sevastopol is just as good. Comparing this story to her bio on Wikipedia, I say they honoured her."
" NOT Fury, NOT War Horse
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,8,"Short review. Good movie, worth watching. For a not Hollywood movie it's actually quite good BUT the movie is more focused around personal horrors and personal romance rather than the siege(s) itself."
" nothing special but watchable
",2020-03-06 00:00:00,7,The war scenes are very pleasant and well done I would have put an extra vote but some moments it becomes boring ...as far as I'm concerned it's a good movie to see
" Be aware of comments here
",2020-01-28 00:00:00,10,"A lot of nonsense was said in this reviews about this movie. American specialists of how Russians were living during 1935-1945 will tell you ""their truth"".
In reality this movie is very accurate. I confirm it from all stories I'm hearing from my grandpas and grandmas who were living during those years as children.
And remember, USSR won that war. In 1941 in relatively warm October when they stopped Germans next to Moscow. It wasn't winter. Secondly, Germans attacked on June 22nd. They had plenty of time to win. Wile British were running out to their island after 1 month of the war. French surrendered too instantly. Americans were too scared to fight. And Americans joined to war only in 1943-44 when Germans were very weak just to get their pie."
" ""INDESTRUCTIBLE"": The story of Lyudmila Pavlichenko, the most successful female sniper in history
",2019-08-01 00:00:00,9,"Lyudmila Pavlichenko was studying History at the University of Kiev before the Nazis - Germany, Italy and Romania - declared war to the USSR in 1941. Her friends took her to a shooting club where she discovered that she had outstanding shooting skills. When the war broke out, she was incorporated in the Red Army's 25th Rifle Division, where she shot 309 fascists, including 36 enemy snipers, during the sieges of Odessa and Sevastopol. Wounded several times and suffering from PTSD, she always returned to the front lines and became a symbol of resistance and a Hero of the Soviet Union. She was gravely injured by mortar fire in June 1942. Later the same year, she visited with President Franklin Roosevelt - being the first Soviet citizen to be welcomed at the White House - and became close friends with Eleanor Roosevelt, who visited her in Moscow in 1957.
The Russian actress Yuliya Peresild portrays Lyudmila Pavlichenko with accuracy and passion, and the film has been widely acclaimed by critics for its visually striking depiction of the second world war."
" This is not about history, not really
",2019-07-27 00:00:00,8,"This is about an amazing woman during one of the worst times in human history. There were many like her, russian female snipers were very well known during that time. This is not about my home town of Sevastopol, which is why I wanted to watch this movie. It doesn't matter that you think the cinematography was not good, the point of the matter is.. IT HAPPENED. And that alone deserves respect. Whether you understand the movie, or have to watch it with subtitles, it doesn't matter. Dont just treat it as another wanna be blockbuster, loon into the story behind it. Yes, Russia have no idea how to make blockbusters. But they do know how to tell a story. It may take them 50 years, but they will eventually tell the rest of the world what really happened. Remember that and also think about this ACTUAL person that did something that most of us would not do. I read some reviews before posting this. You get soooo wrapped up in the technicality of this movie you dont see the life story behind it. Open your eyes
And learn to respect history."
" Very interesting subject, deserving of a much better film than this
",2019-06-02 00:00:00,3,"The story of Lyudmila Pavlichenko, the female Russian sniper who killed 309 Germans on the Eastern Front in WW2.Fascinating subject: the woman who was one of the most successful snipers in history and centred around one of the most heroic defensive battles of WW2. Should be an easy enough task to make this into a good movie, right?Wrong. Somehow the writers and director Sergey Mokritskiy turn this story into something very lame. The battle scenes are reasonably well done, and quite realistic, but it's the rest that messes this up. Romantic sub-plots, the Eleanor Roosevelt angle, the political stuff: they all seem half-baked and just filler.Add in some atrocious supporting performances - the ""American"" journalists (most seemed to be Russian pretending to be American) are particularly bad. Yuliya Peresild puts in a solid performance in the lead role though.Even the title is badly done - the Battle for Sevastopol actually takes up less than half of the movie and is not the main focus of the film, Lyudmila Pavlichenko is.Concentrate on Lyudmila Pavlichenko, leave out all the half-baked romantic stuff, silly sub-plots and sentimentality, stick largely to battle scenes and give this a better title and it could have been really good. Lyudmila Pavlichenko deserves far better than the actual finished product."
" I consider this one of the great war movies of all time.
",2019-05-14 00:00:00,10,"No war movie comes as close to portraying the toll war has on those who wage it, even the survivors and heros. No war was more terrible than the Eastern Front in WW2. This movie shows that."
" Excellent
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,8,"After watching the movie I said to myself, all of the crew who worked for this film has lived the scenario.. bravo"
" Awsome 10/10
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,10,"This movie have became one of my favorites 2 war films that I have seen so far.
It combines a personal biographical history, of the most successful female sniper during World War II (309) Kills. The movie also shows the diplomatic battle in USA for bringing the involvement of USA in 2 war.
In one of the scenes that actually happens in Chicago 1942, she stood before large crowds, with this phrase:
""Gentlemen, I am 25 years old and I have killed 309 fascist invaders by now. Don't you think, gentlemen, that you have been hiding behind my back for too long?"".
The script, performances, locations and shooting is just awesome, it makes you feel inside the eyes of Lyudmila Pavlichenko.Im surprised it has just a 7 at IMBD , maybe its because Americans doesn't like to be reminded that they were hiding from 2 world war for 2 years."
" Better Than American Sniper: Battle For Sevastopal
",2018-12-01 00:00:00,8,"Enemy at the Gates is the ultimate Russian war movie and still remains number one in that genre. However, a new number two film for Russian war films has emerged: The Battle For Sevastopol. This unbelievable, but true, story of a Russian female sniper with over 300 confirmed kills boggles the mind from start to finish. She was shot twice, blown up twice from motar attacks, and suffered many other deprivations of war. But she was an expert marksman who not only survived several brutal years of German invasion of Russia, but killed hundreds of the enemy, including over two dozen male German snipers. Dubbed ""Lady Death"" by the media, she was a favorite of Eleanor Roosevelt and went on tour with the First Lady to raise funds for the war in a joint Russia-US effort. This film has excellent production values, as Fox goes all out. Don't miss it."
" Brilliant
",2018-11-25 00:00:00,8,"I would highly recommend if your into strong female leads. I love seeing a world war 2 movie from a different countries perspective. Having a female be the main character in a war movie is also a perk! We don't see many movies like this. I thought the directing was unique and the cinematography was great as well. Yulia Pereslid's acting was AMAZING! Her acting alone had me tearing up. The only odd thing I noticed was that there were many vocie overs. Noticable voice overs. They did not blend in well at all. The voices were off and they were much louder then the other voices. I literally laughed out loud because they were all that bad. But overall, the film was very well made, so the poor voice overs surprised me very much."
" Inspired Research
",2018-11-25 00:00:00,8,"181123: A Russian lady sniper with over 300 kills. How cool is that? And, how fantastic is the Mosin Nagant M91 PU Sniper rifle? This film had me searching the web for more history. A dramatic, fun film that delves into the life and nature of Lyudmila Pavlichenko. Loved it."
" Must see.
",2018-10-17 00:00:00,10,Amazing film about a true hero during WWII. Well shot. Dramatic. Amazing performances. Truely a must see.
" Absolutely riveting
",2018-09-10 00:00:00,10,"After the first 30 minutes or so this movie was something I just couldn't stop watching. Be warned, your feels might get waffle stomped a bit."
" poor
",2018-08-28 00:00:00,4,Honestly its poor From the utopia start to the so called training that never happend like that to the organisation and the plates of foodRubbish and although low budget it doesn't even tell a story well
" Are we still in 50's??
",2018-07-19 00:00:00,1,"Watching of this movie ended for me after 40 seconds, when i realized it has been dubbed like from the best Soviet days...
We are in 2018! Learn that you dont have to do it and just use subtitles!Everything else is so badly under the shadow of this that it is not even worthy of mention!"
" Misleading title!
",2018-04-06 00:00:00,3,"Even if this is a biography, I was expecting a historical movie, war scenes and some action. The most of the movie is about complex romance, female soldiers and too much girl talks, and american woman. Unnecessary scenes not only made the movie longer but also much more boring (for example, do we have to watch some soldier's walking all down the hall... and some other walking.. and more walking ... and staring each other for minutes). And american first lady unnecessarily took too much time and it was not adding anything to the movie. Just a visit! Even shooting scenes did not leave any effect on me. The gun was shaking or she was shooting without keeping a serious posture. not realistic! Overall, this movie does not show the strength of Pavlichenko as Russians or Ukranians would like to see, rather the movie shows her as a weak, confused and reluctant person. Wasn't this movie about a war hero? Sadly, hollywood movie (Enemy at the Gates) shows the Russian perspective more realistically than this movie. 3/10."
" Soviet Union Sniper
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,7,"If you're expecting a film like Fortress of War (2010), you're mistaken just like i was because this is a biographical film focusing on Lyudmila Pavlichenko who's a Soviet Union female sniper with 309 confirmed kills. I agree with the other reviewer who said that the title's quite misleading, this film's not mainly about the battle in Sevastopol itself. I don't understand why they didn't get a more befitting title for this film.With a non-linear storytelling style, this film shows the beforemath, the moment and the aftermath of the fearsome superiority of Pavlichenko aka ""Lady Death"" who hunted regular soldiers and officers in a battlefield during World War II. Yulia Peresild, who played Pavlichenko managed to portray the character really well. She's cold, suffering, heroic, and lovable, kinda reminds me of Mulan. I have to tell you the Russian dubbing for English parts are annoying, they should make Russian subtitles instead of dubbing. The war action scenes (shooting, camouflaging, covering, planning strategy, etc) even though interesting are too short which i'd estimate no more than 10% of the duration so it's overall drama and that's very unsatisfying.So if you like films about snipers such as Enemy At The Gates, American Sniper, you have to check this one out. I'd say this is isn't as good as Enemy At The Gates but it's as interesting as American Sniper.7/10"
" Wow.
",2017-05-18 00:00:00,10,"Although it's mostly in Russian with subtitles, I was drawn in deeply and remained so throughout the duration. This is the most gripping WW2 film I've seen since Saving Private Ryan. The direction, acting, cinematography are all top notch. It tells the story of heroic Russian sniper without glamorizing war. Instead the horror of war is pervasive and though she is a survivor her story is tragic. It's also very interesting to get a glimpse of Stalin-era Soviet culture. It's a must see for anyone interested in WW2, history, biographies, or intense drama."
" This story is stronger than her film adaptation
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,10,"Not the best film adaptation of this story. The authors should have taken the script more seriously. The actors starred the film, but they could not fix it. There is no other adaptation. This story is so important that it is worth seeing, despite the shortcomings. Although the story of a woman, she charged more for men than for women. The authors clearly did not disclose all the female feelings."
" Excellent!!!
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,10,"Incredible, really moving. I would have never known she existed until seeing the movie. I wish there were more about her life after the war but there is very little information available online or in print. Absolutely amazing story, highly recommended! If you liked ""American Sniper"", then put this movie on your 'Must See' list."
" Subtitled but good
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie, even though it's not in English. I've seen many great movies, where I've had to read subtitles.It is based on a true story, about a courageous woman. You need to watch it for yourself.I don't want to spoil it for you."
" This movie was more about romance than WWII.
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,5,"The first 30 minutes movie was actually pretty good. But then the movie transformed into romantic drama with war moving into background. Lady Death's romance took up about 60% of the movie, with 20% being war and 20% being her time in the U.S. Why not take the opportunity to focus on her time as a soldier, rather than her time as a ""woman""? That being said the good parts were well done and it's hard to believe that the scenes were done with such a limited budget. I think a remake should be made with much more funding and a different director.The movie fell well short of its potential and I would not recommend the movie."
" Misnamed movie--a great character study
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,9,"First of all the movie is misnamed. It is no more about the battle for Sevastopol than Dr. Zhivago was about the Russian Revolution. A better title might have been, ""Lyudmila's War."" This was an excellent character study of the battle between the inhumanity of war and the humanity of the people who are forced to wage it. I found the film to be very well done and once into it, had to see it through. The war scenes were vivid and believable, and the characters were played realistically. One could see the changes that overcame the heroine, Lyudmila Pavlichenko, who was initially tepid about killing but warmed to the task--to the point of actually relishing in it. She reveled in competing with men--even in an environment that was nominally committed to gender equality. We witnessed a transformation from a studious girl, who was never appreciated by her stern military father, to a killing machine (who refused to leave the battlefield, even when seriously wounded)--with snatches of the frailties of emerging womanhood. It is a complex tale, one that should be watched at least twice to realize its full impact."
" Old tired Soviet cliché
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,2,"For someone who was born 14 years after the WW2 ended and who grew up in USSR watching hundreds of similar war flicks, this one just doesn't cut it. It isn't a movie even, it's a primitive cartoon, full of stick figure characters, and how can anyone sympathize with walking stick figures is beyond me. There are no people in this movie, not one, not even the lady Eleanor - played by the sole American on the cast. And certainly not the protagonist Lyuda, although I can see that she tried. I just can't imagine why would anyone make a movie like that in 2015. To me, it clearly belongs in the late 1950 - early 1960s era, back when better directors made better movies than this one - every year by a dozen."
" Opium dream from Putin, propaganda and lies. Revolting
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,1,"Any student of history or even a passing interest in WW-2 will see this as an opium pipe dream to brainwash the Russian young. Long-winded, unrealistic ""heroic machines"" of the soviet state set an example for the gullible. The movie starts in 1937 but completely fails the slightest mention of the Molotov- Ribbentrop alliance between Stalin and Hitler, and tries to present a peaceful Russia suddenly dragged into war by German surprise aggression. Insulting to the terrible suffering of Russians before the war and the extraordinary sacrifices made by them during the war, and the engineered genocide of 7 million Ukrainians by Stalin in the early 1930s. A travesty."
