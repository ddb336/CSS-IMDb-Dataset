" Just plain awful!
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,4,Avoid at all cost! No redeeming features of any sort.
" Below average...
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,3,"""The Transporter Refueled"" is an Action - Thriller movie in which we watch a former special forces mercenary getting into some dangerous situations. He tries to survive but he has to use his knowledge, his training and his experience in order to do so.Since I had already watched the previous ""Transporter"" movies, I had some expectations by it. I did not expect from it to be a masterpiece but at least a watchable action movie, something that it was not. The direction which was made by Camille Delamarre was below average and he did not succeed on crating a bond between the audience and his main actor, something that had as a result to cannot relate with him. In conclusion, I have to say that ""The Transporter Refueled"" is a below average action movie and if you have already the previous ""Transporter"" movies I advise you to lower your standards otherwise you will be disappointed."
" Fun
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,7,This is a completely impossible movie to believe but at the same time it has great car chases and fights and is just a fun escapist romp.
" When does the Transporter show up?
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,1,"Having the only person to EVER play The Punisher in a live action role, was literally, the only reason to watch this. I get changing out the star actor, but maybe go with someone who can actually play the part? Danny DeVito or Pauly Shore would have been able to perform closer to Jason Statham's character than this kid. What were you thinking?"
" Too much camera shake spoiling the action...
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,6,"Shakycam strikes again, how on earth are you supposed to see the action if the damn camera doesn't stay still long enough to see what's going on. Putts."
" Decent
",2020-11-10 00:00:00,4,Decent movie. Had alot of potential but just crappy writing as usual.
" WTF.
",2020-10-28 00:00:00,3,"Seriously, how did this even qualify as a transporter movie?"
" When will they stop making Euro trash like this?
",2020-10-20 00:00:00,1,"I like me an Asylum movie every once in a while, which says a thing or two about my level of tolerance, but this pompous garbage was too low brow even for me to last more than 20 minutes."
" if you ever wonder..
",2020-10-06 00:00:00,1,"What if an incel is in charge of a movie, this movie would be it."
" a good try
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,6,"Could be subtitled ""put on your lipstick, we want to talk about hiring you as a driver"""
" Jason is missed very badly in this movie
",2020-09-30 00:00:00,3,"The Transporter Refueled is an action thriller directed by Camille Delamarre and stars Ed Skerin, Loan Chabanol, Ray Stevenson and Radivoje Bukvic. This is the fourth movie of Transporter series and first without Statham.Ed Skerin reprise the role played by Jason Statham in the previous 03 movies and is a disappointment to some extent, although he is been sincere to his character but couldn't match the rough and tough looks and is ineffective.Plot is simple and predictable and instead of pure transporter plot it looks more of a revenge drama and looks like the main lead in dragged onto it. Acting is average and no one looks convincing in fact the bonding between Father and son looks unconvincing. Villain looks week and doesn't impresses. Climax of the movie is very much predictable and it seems that the director was in a hurry to shot the climax, cinematography is decent and since the series is known for it's action sequences some of the action scenes looks unrealistic, specially the car chase scenes.Overall the movie is a disappointment and typical die-hard fan of the franchise will also be disappointed, if they have to come back they have to come with a strong plot and some decent cast otherwise it will be the end of a good franchise."
" Too Many Wigs ...
",2020-07-07 00:00:00,1,"Even though the main character is English , he speaks with a peculiar South African accent !He then proceeds to beat up, for some obscure reason, a dozen or so heavyweights single-handed ... Oh, and the Audi S8 crashes a chair-locked steel gate open without demolishing the radiator !! Audi should use that scene when advertising ""Varsprung durch Tecknik"" ...All in all, a silly romp somewhere in the South of France burning rubber with leggy females in Wigs ! A waste of my time ... save yours !!"
" Pretty good!
",2020-06-01 00:00:00,3,"I put this on as background noise, but ended up happily paying attention the whole way through. Rather sad that this hasn't carried on with Ed Skrein in the role - Ed's got some of Statham's sneering bravado, but he seems a great deal nicer, and there's room for him to be a sympathetic character; one of Statham's biggest problems is he plays such glowing, self-assured, no-mistakes characters that the movies have to dazzle, bc there's no one to root for.Loan Chabanol impressed, and Ray Stevenson is a joy in everything he does - also upset there's never been a place for Ray Stevenson, Spy in film before.The fight scenes werent anything special, sadly, and only the first driving sequence had any thrill to it - sort of felt like they ran out of money. But, again, it had a lot more heart than its predecessors, so they weren't missed all that much. I liked it!"
" Good Film!
",2020-06-01 00:00:00,5,Not bad film to reboot the franchise. It was much better than the third film. Sucks that Jason didn't come back to play frank. The action sequences was well done. Ed skrein was ok as Frank but it's not easy to step into Jason shoes. I do think it deserves another sequel with Skrein back as Frank. I honestly thought I would've liked it but I did. The problem with the franchise is that all of the villains are badly written & boring. It's worth a watch for sure. 5/10
" A darn shame
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,4,"The Transporter franchise has always been a fun ride, but this entry into the series is a pretty brutal reboot. The plot of these films have never been anything extraordinary, but entertaining nonetheless. Here we have our silly plot present, but the action choreography and well shot car chase scenes are now missing. Fight scenes now consist of multiple cuts and don't have quite the clear direction like the other ones. (Transporter 3 had terribly edited fight and chase scenes but this somehow manages to be worse).
The actors do what they can with what they have. If the team behind the film maybe took a little more time with it, it could have been another fun entry. You can find better films of this kind to watch."
" Refueled
",2020-03-01 00:00:00,5,"The Good: Exciting car chase sequences, eventhough it sort of mimics the Fast Furious series. Ray Stevenson's Frank Martin Sr. steals the show. The Not-so-Good: Ed Skrein doesn't exudes the charm of Jason Statham's, which is one of the signature of the series. Thus he couldn't carry the movie on his own. Some of the fight sequences feel stilted and not as smooth as Transporter series' trademark. No chemistry between Frank and Anna, thus the feeling between them isn't too believable. Once again, Russian are stereotyped as bad guys."
" Refueled? Nah, still empty.
",2019-10-29 00:00:00,3,"Nice car chases. Nice martial art fights. Nice slender women. Poor script, poor actors, and the two 'nice' things I mentioned got boring, The women stayed nice. Martin practiced 45 days for his fights and I give him credit for that but after the 3rd or 4th fight, it got, ""oh, hum another fight."" This cast & crew should not attempt a 5th."
" Not great, but not the worst action movie either
",2019-10-15 00:00:00,6,"I'm not convinced. I think everything we loved about the Frank Martin in the trilogy, has been left out. But I guess it was necessary in order to give birth to a new one with a different cast... It was nonetheless entertaining, if you're able to make abstraction of the previous movies, which should ask a few minutes!"
" Best movie ever I have seen
",2019-10-01 00:00:00,10,Best movie ever Ihave seen is the best and the best
" Yosemite Sam filling in for Statham.
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,2,"Wow what a horrible sequel, they were all good up to this one, couldn't they have picked an actor without a lisp? Poor story, poor acting, bad action, no soul."
" No return for Statham
",2019-08-15 00:00:00,4,"THE TRANSPORTER REFUELLED is the fourth instalment of the TRANSPORTER franchise and the first without Jason Statham, the reason being that they couldn't afford this paycheque this time around. Statham is replaced by Ed Skrein, of GAME OF THRONES stardom, who appears weak, wooden and ineffectual by comparison. The film itself is the usual light thriller that doesn't make a whole lot of sense if you look at it too closely. Our hero transports three vengeful women assassins around as they try to take down a human trafficker. The best role goes to a slick and charismatic Ray Stevenson, who walks over every other actor in the proceedings. The film is light on car chases but has a lot of hand-to-hand combat, some of which is promising, albeit spoilt by the usual over-direction and random editing that makes everything that little bit worse to look at."
" Doesn't work without Statham
",2019-08-15 00:00:00,2,"I didn't realise Statham wouldn't be in this movie. And the replacement doesn't even come close in personality, charm, sophistication etc. This really is a hollow shell of a film. It's not even one of these films you'd watch when you're ill and can't concentrate on much."
" Disappointed
",2019-07-13 00:00:00,3,"Went into this blindly expecting another dose of Statham king-fu and the usual but no, we get a guy who just can't pull it off (no innuendos please) like our Jason can. Poor film. Not worth the hour and a half of your life. Watch something else."
" Meh, but a LOUD meh.
",2019-07-09 00:00:00,5,"Transporter Refueled was the 2015 reboot of the franchise that once rivalled Fast and Furious in the 2000's, but laid dormant within daytime television after Transporter 3 saw too great a diminished return.Jason Statham was replaced by Ed Skerin and amazingly fans bitched about it, let alone notice, so the film did not break even in America and just about made a profit through worldwide sales. Not exactly a triumphant return which is probably the reason we have not heard nout of The Transporter series since. None of which i get because what I saw in Transporter Refuelled was good action filmmaking bolstered by strong character development centred around a protagonist that has had over ten years worth of layers put upon him. What can i say, i stopped counting the clock and enjoyed myself, for a while at least.Transporter Refuelled is entertaining with it's balance of pulpish storytelling and dynamic spectacle. The plot is complex, though not complicated, and there are attempts at character development which I appreciate. The camerawork is overbearingly shaky at times and the editing is a little hyperactive though. Also, the action scenes, while entertaining, are not realistic in the slightest, literally flying over the rules of gravity. So the film does feel to be stuck in the 2000's where it matters the most. However, the focus on character makes this improbability more tolerable than it was in the predecessors. I don't know, i've never seen them. It does feel very 2010's to take pulp storytelling very super seriously and Refueled appears to be a mix of old and new blockbuster trends.I can probably see now why this film did not light up the box office. It's mediocre. Despite all the good i've said, it's still as much of a needless fight between hollywood superhero movie and restrained european thriller and the result is, obviously, very stupid. Whether the intent or not was to laugh during some scenes, the over-reliance on cliches, both visual and narrative, which is now par the course for the Luc Besson brand, makes the distinction between irony and incompetence very unclear.In conclusion, more effort needed to be put into Transporter Refuelled to make people care about the franchise again, but since all people give a damn about now is I.Ps from their childhood, this was going to be a futile task no matter what. I feel somewhat sorry for the film, but I can still see it as a prime example of one of France's most famous action directors and his entourage resting on their laurels and not really trying to keep up with their times. I believe the words I'm looking for are above average."

" I DON'T USE THE PHONE WHEN I'M DRIVING
",2019-06-21 00:00:00,6,"The Transporter, Frank Martin (Ed Skrein) who never uses his real name, is contracted to transport some packages, and it only surprises him that the packages are humans (been there, done that, remember?). These are women who worked as prostitutes/escorts/hostesses for a crime boss (Radivoje Bukvic) and a number of smaller bosses, all who have millions. They devise a plan whereby they can get the money, wear Swedish Bikini Team blond wigs, and advertise Audi cars. This is not just an Audi, but one that can side swipe automobiles, hit fire hydrants and never have so much as superficial paint scratch. Graphene?The film is high octane, and needlessly so. I have noticed a trend to uses Audi automobiles as opposed to Jaguars for the cool car. In this film, there was a scene when Frank is being chased by the police, they swap cars....to a nearly identical Audi. What's the point? Dad (Ray Stevenson) manages to do an American Express commercial. I just feel like going out and buying an Audi and charging it on my AX card using my IPhone 5 (also prominently displayed a gazillion times).The film is a reboot. Jason Statham wouldn't do it for less than $11 million, so we get Jason Statham lite, a man who arguably is a better actor, but not the box office draw. The movie takes place supposedly in 2010 (1995 + 15 years) yet uses later model I-Phones and Audis. The reboot throws at the audience all the gimmicks of a Transporter film, but it has very little substance. Stick a fork in it.Guide: 1 F-bomb. Implied sex. No nudity."
" Disapointing
",2019-03-17 00:00:00,1,"I Think Ed actually delivered a good performance, but after Jason Statham he can't be Frank Martin. He could have been his younger brother, cousin or whatever but not Frank Martin.
The plot was stupid an not very interesting. I think that the part 'Anna' wasn't very convincing and generally I wasn't entertainted.
And the ""real"" Frank Martin loves his car and wouldn't have set it on fire or left it at a junkyard."
" Advertising films for large lighting audi stations.
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,4,"Advertising films for large lighting audi stations. The main body of the male is thin, and he always feels that the image is not suitable for this type of movie. Let's not mention the plot, but the level of reluctance to sleep anyway."
" The Brits Return
",2019-02-15 00:00:00,3,"So the old Brit star got replaced by a new Brit star.But at least Statham got his teeth fixed.Wish I had more to say about it really. Nice looking females.-drumming fingers--whistling-I suppose I could change channels and see the ending.Nah, an old re-run of Friends sounds better."
" Premium Refuel!
",2018-11-27 00:00:00,7,"Surprisingly this reboot is better than I expected. It also pays a number of respectful homages to its three predecessors.Let's be very clear. There is nothing much original or new with this film. It follows the templates already established; lots of car chases and unbelievable car stunts, combined with plenty of martial arts action. Skrein doesn't have Statham's martial arts background, but the fight sequences are well choreographed and not excessively tightly edited, allowing you to see some techniques happening.What does work well is the introduced character of Frank Sr. played by Ray Stevenson, replacing Inspector Tarconi. Rather than being token support, Stevenson's character has a smooth, realistic chemistry happening with his screen son and is also given plenty of opportunities to shine in his own light.The plot, though typically outlandish, as most action films are, does endeavour to provide a few perhaps unexpected, but nevertheless appreciated, twists and turns, that you'll generally not get in your typical action vehicle.All in all it's recommended that you try to thumb down a ride with this Transporter."
" Hated myself for wasting my life watching this garbage
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,1,"This film made me hate all the protagonists and every secondary character. It made me hate the producers, directors, and their families. It made me hate my HOA and I demanded reparations from everyone in my HOA. Utter garbage. You are better off killing yourself than watching this trash, and I say that as a friend."
" nothing spasial
",2018-08-28 00:00:00,2,"I am curious that all Transporter movies stars with fight .
and this movie more likely commercial ad for Audi cars .
more impotent thing is 
i think Frank Martin Sr is a some kind undercover UK operator, but any how this young girls manage to acquire his informations."
" Terrible
",2018-07-22 00:00:00,2,"The movies name should be changed to ""where is my father"""
" Like so many already said. No.....
",2018-07-20 00:00:00,1,"Avoidable. I normally would go further into depth with reasons why. However there is no need, due to the other reviews pointing out the exact same thoughts and feelings."
" The Transporter Refueled
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,1,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerThis is gonna be extremely short.A story full of clichés, bad acting, horrible action sequences, a load of product placement, and an overlong runtime.This is a recipe for a bad movie."
" I couldn't even watch half off the movie
",2018-01-25 00:00:00,1,"Damn x 101, You're better of watching the first 2 or 3 movies. Ed Skrein and Ray Stevenson had no chemistry it was like watching 2 monkeys fighting over a banana peel that no other monkeys wanted. I must correct myself watch I said about the 2 monkeys fighting over a banana peel is for every actor that played in the movie. And I think watching 2 monkeys fight is a better watch than this.Every new movie they make if it's a reboot or not they are all the same: everybody looking like they have a lot of money, and they all look so arrogant you just wanna punch them all so hard in the face. Please Hollywood stop making such terrible movies!!!! The fx, acting, and overall movie is bad (and I have only seen half of the movie. You can better watch ""older"" movies they are a lot better than this......."
" A terrible attempt at a cliché action franchise
",2017-11-02 00:00:00,1,"This attempt at rebooting the transporter franchise has been out for a few years now and nothing has been heard from it, probably because it is awful. The premise of the film sees the transporter forced into working a job because his estranged father is kidnapped. Ed skein plays the transporter in this film and he is a decent actor, I saw this in deadpool but in this film he is bad. He just doesn't fit the role and I didn't care about his character at all. There was just no charisma or life to his performance to help drag this film. Ray stevens plays his father in the film and I really didn't care about there relationship at all, he came across as pretty annoying and whiny which didn't help. All the other companions and villains in the film were garbage with no interesting things about them at all. The story in the film is so overcomplicated and ridiculous that you will lose track of what's going on or why you should even care. The script is cheesy and boring in all the wrong ways, nothing is funny and nothing brings out the drama so why should you care. The style has some okay action scenes but there is also some action scenes that are stupidly elaborate and awkward that you are questioning what you are watching. Overall this film is definitely not worth a watch unless you like awful action films."
" Should not have used this title! :o
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,2,"I don't think they should have used the title transporter for this movie nor the same character. I didn't know if it was supposed to be a p$%% take or not, but that is definitely what I thought. Could not bring myself to watch more than 20 min, and they were painful 20 min I tell ya...."
" A bit of fun, but not great.
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,6,"Ed Skrein doesn't hold a candle to Jason Statham in this role, try though he might. The actual plot is not too bad, with I wouldn't say twists and turns, but maybe the odd curved ball, to keep the viewer interested. Many of the stunts are pretty good. Some of the acting, though, is atrocious."
" what's the point without Jason Statham
",2017-06-16 00:00:00,5,"Frank Martin (Ed Skrein) is the transporter, a professional driver for hire with a personal code. His dad (Ray Stevenson) is a newly retired British secret agent. Frank is hired by Anna (Loan Chabanol) and her three beautiful friends. He gets dragged into a bank heist revenge plot against the Russian mobster who fifteen years earlier had trafficked the girls into sex slavery. When he tries to cancel the deal, they reveal that they have kidnapped his father.The story is reasonable for a Transporter movie. There are car chases and action fights. It's a little weird that Anna hasn't aged in 15 years. It should be 5 years instead. The missing presence of Jason Statham hangs over this movie. With Statham being so busy and probably much more expansive, replacing him is an understandable move. Luc Besson tries to continue the franchise with newcomer Ed Skrein. He has the Euro-smirk down pat but he can't replace Statham. It's too big of an ask. Besson should have Statham do a cameo to hand off the baton. Ed Skrein could be a disciple or even his little brother. In that way, Statham could always return to the franchise like Vin Diesel returning to the Fast and Furious franchise. At this point, Statham could return only if this movie is forgotten like a bad hangover."
