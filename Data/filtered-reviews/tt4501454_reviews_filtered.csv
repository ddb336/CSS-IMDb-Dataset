" Accurate portrayal of mother-daughter relationship
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,9,"This movie is an astute portrayal of a mother's relationship with her daughter. The specificities and little details help the relationship feel real. Good character detail, and even though not a whole lot happens, it is overall a great dramedy."
" Those who gave it a 1ðŸ‘Ž
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,10,Maybe You have to have lived this story with your mom to appreciate it. It was beautiful and had me laughing all the way through.
" Stupid people leaving bad reviews
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,9,"This movie is fantastic! (And I have great taste in movies) Don't listen to the haters, watch it and you'll see"
" A light hearted, fun to watch story that every one can identify with
",2019-05-28 00:00:00,8,"A must watch for the awesomeness named Susan Sarandon!!!!
Oh she just becomes the character.So this is a story of a 'more than necessary', 'concerned' meddling mom (Susan Sarandon) who kinda is super clingy to her 'not that young', 'in her late thirties' daughter (Rose Byrne)
The movie is such a simple yet heartwarming story about coping with loss, the way it plays out on our personalities..
I watched this movie, to start with just as a mode of killing time... but it's a must watch cuz each one of us can feel in the shoes of the characters..n inspite of being light hearted, this one has such strong characters ..
The writing has depth..
There was a scene where I found myself laughing out loud with the mom - daughterAnd what starts as a fun movie about a mom
Crossing her boundaries turns into this really deep connection that this character has with others..I thoroughly enjoyed it!!
A fabulous choice to watch it with the entire family, il definitely watch it again with my mom for sure..8 out of 10 from me, for a light hearted, superbly written, fun must watch!PS: also loved Rose Byrne's work!! Amazing"
" This is so genuinely touching!
",2019-02-16 00:00:00,9,"I had no idea I would enjoy this movie as much as I did, I almost didn't watch it! I am so glad I did. It is the most real, relatable and truly touching movie I've seen in a while. Especially if you're a woman 40+, this will speak to your soul in many ways! Happy viewing xxx"
" Absolutely bland and overdone love story
",2019-01-22 00:00:00,2,This film has great actors but absolutely poor writing!
" Enjoyable for a Lazy Sunday afternoon
",2018-12-07 00:00:00,7,"I did quite like this film. It was not full of some over the top drama or illogical romance I'm so used to seeing in Hollywood films. This one was more believable and relatable. Susan Sarandon was a joy to watch. There was never a dull moment with her. I didn't take much of a liking to Rose Byrne's character though. She came off as some vapid over-worked brat who was irritating to watch.And while the film is supposedly about an overbearing mother incessantly meddling with her daughter's life, what the film actually focused on was the journey of the mother coming to terms with her late husband's death and her courage in letting go in order to be happy in life again. It wasn't really much about the daughter at all, so that's a bit confusing.Overall, it's a great film to relax to."
" It's charming!
",2018-10-02 00:00:00,7,"I'm going to go against the grain here, but I think this is a charming little money that gives you a few laughs. It's essentially about a widow and mother who uses her money to help people she doesn't really know that well but who shes formed a connection with. It's not going to blow your mind but it's feel good..."
" Trying to get through it
",2018-09-08 00:00:00,2,I'm not sure why I thought this was a comedy? And it's not a drama or action flick. The only reason I'm still watching it is because I paid $4.00 to rent it. It's a little like watching paint dry...super boring
" Superb film - a gem, beautifully performed and understated.
",2018-07-07 00:00:00,10,"Once in a while, a film touches you on a deeper level. It is gentle, unpredictable and thought provoking. This is such a film. Beautifully acted, Susan Sarandon carries the scenes on her own. It is one of her best performances since Dead Man walking.Films are so often obvious. They can be absurd even, but this film was so true to life. Expect the unexpected and actually things don't add up and you can't just fit things into a box with a neat little bow. Life is confusing, chaotic and beautiful. It's real. That's it and this film shows it all fully without covering up the details. And yet things aren't always said, they are implied or hinted at. I love it.I love a film that leaves you wondering, yet already knowing. Thanks for this.I don't usually write a film review, well hardly ever, but today I felt I needed to write one about The Meddler - enjoy."
" Inconsequential
",2018-05-23 00:00:00,6,"Marnie, widowed nearly two years ago is trying to find a new purpose in life, but it's not easy. Having moved from New Jersey to LA to be near her screenwriter daughter (who finds her mother's constant presence in her life overpowering), Marnie's new life includes planning and funding an expensive wedding for a casual acquaintance, accidental work as a movie extra, encouraging a young iPad salesman to widen his educational horizon and ferrying him to night classes (with consequences), and meeting a man who keeps chickens.Written and directed by Lorene Scafaria, whose scant previous credits include writing/directing Seeking A Friend For The End Of The World and writing Nick And Nora's Infinite Playlist, this movie (which arrived at my local cinema without so much as a trailer preceding it) features Susan Sarandon as Marnie, Rose Byrne as daughter Lori, JK Simmons as Zipper (the chicken-owning cop, the script is undecided as to whether he is retired or not), and several other names in supporting roles.It is possible to get irritated with Marnie's mild inability to mind her own business, just as Lori's tendency towards moody angst could get on your nerves, but it is easy to see where these traits come from, and the death of husband/Dad Jack before the film starts is clearly of major importance to both women - indeed, it seeds the final sequence of the film. Likewise, Marnie's tendency to back off - literally - from the possibility of a close relationship with a man comes from the same place. The impulsive decision to bankroll the lesbian wedding of a friend of her daughter, a woman she hardly knows, is puzzling and required more explanation: inherited wealth is the obvious answer, as evidenced by the late husband's expensive car, but it would have helped to have had some explanation.The biggest flaw here is that there seems to be a lack of purpose to the film. It meanders. The drama is gentle, but doesn't always go anywhere much. Things happen and then the expected consequences never materialise. It's all very soap opera-ish, but without any real pay-off to a number of the plot strands which are established.Having said that, there are happy endings - kind of - to the mother/daughter side of things, and one assumes that Marnie and Lori continue their lives in a slightly more contented vein than previously."
" Very nice
",2018-05-20 00:00:00,8,"It might just have been the right moment, the right mood in which I watched the movie. But I really enjoyed watching it and thought it was funny as well. Thought Marnie was a great character. Just a nice ""house, garden and kitchen"" (a.k.a every day life) movie, as we would say in Holland."
" Simple yet a beautiful film
",2018-03-09 00:00:00,8,A film that describes the relationships and the hardships of dealing with pain and moving on. Who knew that simplicity is the key to tell a story like that.
" Susan Sarandon, J.K. Simmons - seems like something great, right? Em... not so fast.
",2018-02-11 00:00:00,5,"Rich and still reasonably young widow (Susan Sarandon) tries to find purpose. Her daughter (Rose Byrne) is tired of constant attention, so the woman looks for other ways to be useful to people.Also playing, J.K. Simmons, Jerrod Carmichael, Lucy Punch, Cecily Strong et al.Nothing to write home about, just another of those emotionally limp, wishy-washy ""old but still kickin' it"" type of drama-comedie-something-movies that the big stars of yesterday like to do so much.The screenplay is as soulless as you would expect from such a project. The story is full of ""done to death"" stuff and outright cliches. There's no proper story development: things happen, end or just disappear fast without finding natural rhythm or reaching to meaningful conclusion...Well, it's still marginally more watchable than, say, Morgan Freeman's latest ""old people"" movies such as ""Just Getting Started"", but it would take a special talent to create something even more vapid, no?Caught in on Netflix, watched to see Sarandon and Simmons. Both are good as always, making every project just a bit more solid just by appearing in it.Surprised to see that Metacritic's and Rotten Tomatoes's scores are pretty good, higher than mine. That's why you should only trust Kapten Video - because other critics have bad taste! Yes. I also dance better than they."
" The hardened hearts out there only want sex and violence
",2017-11-07 00:00:00,9,"-spoiler alert-Nobody likes movies about people, just people, anymore. This movie is sweet, well written, and ends on a happy note. Quit trying to be wanna be movie critics and just enjoy a grown-up movie. And duh, no movie with J.K. Simmons in it is ever bad. Especially with the chickens. Go Griz."
" Feel Good. Time pass
",2017-11-07 00:00:00,6,"The experience can differ from person to person. But it is a nice film for sure. If you want to watch a movie and feel good about it, then this movie serve the purpose. It has no well defined story structure or closure.Simply we are traveling with an old widow, visiting people with her and try to see the world from her point of view.It was all about Susan Sarandon. The 69 year old actress is preforming with full energy. She is driving around , exploring iPhone usage and meeting people. She has her excuses for everything.If you can enjoy a nice acting performance no mater what the script is, then this is an enjoyable film. Also it becomes nicer if you can relate this character to someone from our real life."
" Pushy, intrusive boring movie
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,1,"I hate when directors treats as as the idiots. If selling popular expensive products was not enough ,she is selling her political propaganda and all this falls far from reality.I am bit sorry for Sarandon, who is like De Niro recently ( choosing horrible movies and all his glory years are almost forgotten as all thees bad movies he made for the last 10 years took over ). This is a sponsored movie, so you have to see the labels and listen to the products which were used.I hate that. I wanted ( and should ) to stop watching after one of the first scenes where she asks a very young black boy , entry lever clerk at the store if he wants to merry her college educated (much older !) daughter as it would be her dream ! Oh, she regrets (!) he is bit too young ...!She is rich New Jersey Italian women!That was her dream! Unfortunately ,I have seen another 20 min by accident...Do not waste your time and if you want to buy Ipad ,iphone or other products do your own research,no need to watch this. I admit, I have only seen it half hour."
" Hip deep in stereotypes
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,2,"It's depressing to see a fine actress and lovely lady like Susan Sarandon reduced to doing this kind of comic shtick. There isn't much here you couldn't find in a 1950s TV sitcom about an ""interfering mother"" -- about the only surprise is that the character of Marnie Minervini is not Jewish, but Italian. (Speaking of that: would an Italian mother be bringing over BAGELS? not biscotti or cannoli? Really?)The stereotype of the bossy smother-mother -- well-intentioned, but SO overbearing -- is a very, very old trope and yet the director here, Lorene Scafaria, seems to think she's struck comedic gold. A bonus feature on the DVD is an interview with Scafaria and her own real life mother, on whom the film characters are based...and it comes across as creepy & troubling, not cute. About the only thing original is that the ""smother-mother"" here, Marnie, is a baby boomer and not a member of the Greatest Generation...if you fall into that demographic, it is a bit jarring to realize you are now among the OLDSTERS being mocked, and not the ""young hip generation"" anymore.But the problem with THAT, is when an overbearing mother of that former era was caricatured (unfairly I think), we KNEW someone of that age was a lifetime homemaker & mother, with no real education or career outside of that. So when their kids were grown and their spouse passed away, they had literally NOTHING else in their lives. That is very hard to accept when it comes to a boomer mom, who almost certainly had a career, went to college, etc. If we take Rose Bryne (age 38) and Susan Sarandon (who looks amazing at 70) literally...she did not have her daughter until she was 32. Yet there is no sense whatsoever that Marnie has ever had a profession or career, even part-time...that she had any life beyond marriage & kids...that she has same-age friends (and not just her daughter's friends)...or a life in Manhattan that she has left behind...or that she has always hovered over Lori (Bryne) who at least in her late 30s, for Lori's entire life.That's because Marnie is reduced to a stereotype; a meddling, clinging old crone with no life of her own. If Scarfaria thinks this about her own mother (besides mining her for lame jokes), it is pretty darn sad.Of course the vehicle that finally gives Marnie ""a new life"" and gets her claws out of Lori (a little) has to be....a new romance, supplied by J.K. Simmons (who's as charming as always). Indeed, nice single men in their 70s are clamoring for gorgeous Marnie here, which frankly is not something I've seen much for women I know over 60. And in LOS ANGELES! In other words: it is apparently not possible for a woman to heal from widowhood or loneliness or clinginess...unless she finds a new lover/husband.The other kinda distasteful element of the film is that Scarfaria (either reflecting real life OR a kind of cultural elitism) has made Marnie staggeringly wealthy. Of course, some people ARE really wealthy, but THAT also means the story is far less universal. Most older widows struggle financially -- your Social Security check is cut by a third when your spouse dies -- but not Marnie! SHE has apparently inherited MILLIONS from her husband, about which she acts as if he were a great-uncle who left her an unexpected inheritance. (Wasn't their wealth, their mutual assets, HALF HERS all this time? why was she SURPRISED to get it?) Out of a combination of guilt, wealth, control, naivete, and self-destructiveness, Marnie seems driven to spend her millions inappropriately -- buying expensive Apple electronics for people she barely knows, and throwing a very costly, large wedding for two ALREADY MARRIED lesbian friends of her daughter ....a couple whom she has just met! -- at first offering them $13,000 as tax-free gift....but then, paying entirely for a wedding which is clearly more than 2-3 times that much, being a catered affair on a rented YACHT and including a very costly designer dress for the bride!Though the whole concept is tedious, I think that last part lost the whole believability aspect for me. Even sitcoms have to be grounded in something relatable. If my mother spent a sizable chunk of her assets (and my future inheritance!) on a stranger's gay wedding (and not MY OWN wedding!)...I'd be properly concerned she was mentally ill or even showing signs of impending dementia. That isn't cute. It's troubling. It is troubling if the lesbian couple accepts this much money from a wealthy stranger, even as a gift. NOBODY here is behaving like anything resembling a real, normal human being in 2015.Not funny. Sad."
" Slow paced, endearing movie of a mom's new chapter in life,,,
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,7,"Not sure why all the bad reviews. I mean it's not Oscar worthy, but a sweet simple story of a mom and adult daughter's relationship... really it's more about the mother, trying to rediscover herself after becoming a widow. This charming movie will have you laughing and crying. The pace is slow and simple as we follow along with Marnie as she navigates her new life moving from Jersey to Los Angeles to be closer to her daughter Lori. Lori has her own life problems and is busy with her job, so Marnie begins ""meddling"" in not only her daughter's life, but friends and even stranger's lives too... but in a really helpful kind way. It's the perfect portrayal of how a mom's unselfishness can seem selfish and annoying till you take a step back and see it from another point of view... if that makes sense. Marnie befriends all kinds of people, helping them out and keeping herself busy, while still mourning her husband who passed a few years earlier. She's like a mom to everyone she meets, while her daughter kind of pushes her away. Marnie just wants to figure out where she belongs and how she fits into this new life. It really made me think about how sometimes we take our mom's for granite and forget to appreciate their unconditional love and think of their sacrifices and feelings too. Sarandon brought an endearing quality to Marnie and I was touched by her warmth and kindheartedness. I think this is a good movie for moms and adult daughters, especially mom's of adult kids/empty-nesters (not so much for the man who doesn't appreciate a chick flick.) Oh, and the reviewers who saw it as tons of product placement/an Apple commercial, I never thought of it as that. I saw it as a newly independent elderly woman trying to figure out the high-tech world we now live in... for those of us who didn't grow up with iPhones and internet, etc. it's a whole new world to explore. 7 stars in My Humble Opinion 4/2017"
" Marnie's time
",2017-03-31 00:00:00,5,"The Meddler of the title is Marnie (Susan Sarandon) who has been lonely since her husband has died and ends up overbearing her daughter Lori (Rose Byrne.)However Marnie is well meaning and other people who cross paths with her seem to appreciate her help more than her daughter, Marnie also attracts several admirers including Zipper (JK Simmons) and despite her daughter's rebuffing her intentions, she finds a new purpose in her life.The film has wonderful performances from Sarandon and Simmons, but it is a pretty empty film. Not really a comedy, nor quirky or dramatic enough."
" Proof that A-List Celebrities don't make the Film
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,2,"Yes, there are some pretty big A-listers in this film....Rose Byrne, Susan Sarandon, J.K.Simmons, Jason Ritter, etc...but just because you have some well known faces in your film, it doesn't mean that you have a great film. That should be the takeaway here. My mom is a longtime fan of Susan Sarandon so I watched the film with her. Both of us were bored to tears. The uninteresting life of Marnie and her daughter just seemed to go on for ever and ever and ever. There's no climax in this film, no payoff. Nothing. It just goes on and ends and that's it. There wasn't even any indication that it was even building up to something. It's just the boring story of a mom and her daughter living in L.A. There is no reason to watch this film at all, because it's just a re- enactment of ""REAL LIFE"". Hell, you're probably living Marnie's life right now and I bet you're more interesting than Marnie."
" Charming, feel-good movie...and Apple commercial.
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,6,"'The Meddler', a 2015 film starring Susan Sarandon and Rose Byrne is a sweet, feel-good film. Marnie (Sarandon), is a mother who can't come to grips with losing her husband of several decades, and initially directs all of her attention into her daughter Lori's (Byrne) life. When Lori rebuffs her mother's VERY overwhelming involvement in her affairs, Marnie starts getting involved with anyone who makes her feel needed. Refreshingly, none of these people take advantage of her kindness and extreme generosity. Admittedly, there were quite a few flaws with this movie. The character of Mark (Michael McKeon) was completely unnecessary and added nothing to the film. Jason Ritter played Jacob, Lori's ex-love, and she spent the entire movie grieving the loss of her relationship with him. Ritter was woefully miscast in this part, as there was zero chemistry between him and Byrne. And, the product placement was WAY overdone. I can't believe how many references there were to iPads, iPhones, etc. Obvious and annoying.Beautifully cast, however, was Oscar winner J.K. Simmons as Zipper, a potential romantic interest for Marnie. The sweet scenes they shared in his chicken coop were delightful.All in all, this was a feel-good flick. Predictable, yet pleasant. But due to its many issues could only give 6* out of 10."
" Not as predictable as you would think
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,8,"I had read a brief summary of this film elsewhere... recent widow, interferes in daughters life, interferes in everyone's life, and I expected just another variation on the Bad Mama, Bad Neighbour, Bad anyone-you-can-care to mention theme. Not a bit, though.Sure it seems to start that way, and Marnie (Susan Sarandon) is irritating at first, but as the film went on I warmed to her. It is easy to knock someone who needs to fill their lives maybe with their perceived needs of others, but Marnie is a genuine character. She is no saint, but nor is she unlikeable. She's kind, frustrating, generous, fragile, sensitive, insensitive; in fact she's human.I found it a believable performance by Susan Sarandon. Slightly unsure on the accent, but for all I know the rest could actually just be Susan Sarandon.JK Simmons is always worth watching, and whilst his character may be a bit too flawless, he still ticks all the boxes.Spoiler: I also expected the film to cop-out with the ending: Mother gets what she wants for her daughter, but there's no happy ending for Lori, and in a way that's refreshing.Finally, loved the lighting quality. Everywhere, (plane trips, East Coast, outdoors) was bright, and it made me feel uplifted."
" Top Notch
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,8,"Who wouldn't wish to have Susan Sarandon as a mother? Or at least a friend! I mean even when she has flaws she's amazing. And of course her character has flaws, but who doesn't. Her relationship with Rose Byrne is exceptional. The overall tone is set nicely. And if anything I'd wish this was longer, had more JK Simmons in it.I understand if some feel that not much is happening. It's a valid criticism of the movie. But if you do like the path rather than the overall goal this is heading for, you will cherish that path it takes. It's really well played (no pun intended) and it has a real arc. For more than Sarandon, but especially for her character. There are so many real moments to cherish ... but it has to be something you like, otherwise it doesn't make sense to watch it"
" Pleasant story about adjusting to a new life
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,7,This is a watchable movie about a recent widow who moves from East to West Coast to be with her only daughter who is preoccupied with her screen writing career and her failed romance.She fills the void in her life by helping out at the hospital and helping her daughter's friends wedding and babysitting.The story is touching without being overly sentimental. Nothing too dramatic happens so it's realistic enough.Susan Sarandon looks very young still. This isn't an eccentric character like Sally Field in Hello my name is Doris. Susan is still quite attractive hence lots of men interested in her in the movie. Her suitor is played by JK Simmons. Rose Byrne plays her daughter.Worth one watch.
" less Lori better
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,6,"Marnie (Susan Sarandon) lives an empty life after the death of her husband Joey. His death left her with more money than she needs. She moved from New York to L.A. to be close to her TV writer daughter Lori (Rose Byrne) and her grand-doggies. It's a struggle to fill her days and she is constantly trying to get into Lori's life. She's even going to Lori's therapist. Lori is suffering about her ex Jacob and from Marnie's meddling. Lori travels to New York. Marnie promises to pay for Lori's friend Jillian (Cecily Strong)'s wedding. She gives rides to Freddy from the Apple genius store. She volunteers at the hospital. Zipper (J.K. Simmons) is a retired cop working on a movie set that Marnie accidentally works onto.This actually works better after Lori leaves town. Marnie's adventures are fun. Jillian's wedding feels a little Bridesmaids. There is an overload of funny women but it's fine. Jerrod Carmichael is a fun little appetizer but the main course is J.K. Simmons. I actually missed these characters when Marnie goes to New York. I would rather have an indie about Marnie with Jillian, Freddy, and Zipper. It's a bit depressing without them and I can only take so much."
" Sweet and enjoyable! 5/10
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,5,"Review: I don't think that this movie had the appropriate title, because Marnie Minervini (Susan Sarandon), was really sweet to everyone around her, including her daughter Lori (Rose Byrne), even though she finds her annoying. The movie is based on Marnie, who moves near to her daughter after her husband dies, and tries her best to get close to her daughter, who keeps on pushing her away. Marnie even moves close to her daughter but she still finds it hard to connect to her. When Lori gets a job on a film set, far away from home, Marnie decides to make some drastic changes in her life, to keep herself busy while her daughter is away. She uses her husbands money to fund Lori's friends wedding, and she helps a teenager in the Apple store to further his education, by driving him to night school. She also meets Zipper (J.K. Simmons) whilst mistakenly walking onto a film set but she finds it hard to move on from her dead husband. When her daughter finally comes back from her job, a tricky situation brings them closer together, and she helps an old patient in hospital who she has been visiting from time to time. I personally think that the world would be such a nicer place if there was loads of Marnie's in everyone's life's. She really did see the good in every situation, whilst going through an emotional time in her life, and she didn't ask for anything in return. Although this movie had some witty scenes, I did find Marnie's journey entertaining and quite emotional in parts. Sarandon played her role extremely well but the misguiding title will make it seem more like a comedy than an emotional drama. In all, it's a sweet film with some touching moments, that is worth a watch, especially as it's based on real people. Watchable!Round-Up: At 70 years old, Susan Sarandon has proved that she still has it, and her commitment to he roles are professional, and always on point. Rose Byrne, 37, has also proved that she can cover any genre, in comedic roles in the Bad Neighbours franchise and Spy, to horror movies in the Insidious franchise, and the chemistry between Lori and Marnie in this movie was quite believable, especially the bathroom scene. Anyway, this film was directed by Lorene Scafaria, who also made the Steve Carrell comedy, Seeking a Friend for the End of the World with Keira Knightley. Although she hasn't had much experience behind the camera, she has worked some decent actors, and it was good to see that this movie made a profit at the box office. Budget: $3.2million Worldwide Gross: $5.4millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their comedy/romance/dramas, starring Susan Sarandon, Rose Byrne, J.K. Simmons, Jerrod Carmichael, Cecily Strong, Lucy Punch, Jason Ritter and Michael McKean. 5/10"
