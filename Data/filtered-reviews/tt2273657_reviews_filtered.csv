" Yaaawwwwnnnnn
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,1,"Finkel was chasing the glitter and gold as a NY Times journalist and he wanted to capture a story of the African Slave trade. The only problem was he didn't have actual evidence supporting an actual slave trade. So he made it up. Great story line right? Unfortunately, the movie begins AFTER he gets fired.After being fired from the Times, through a strange connection, he meets a man charged with killing his wife and three kids. The killer claims his innocence and he wants Finkel to tell his story. So through some narcissistic final wish of a killer, they begin writing a book together.A story I don't want to hear from a killer I have no pity for."
" Stlyish, Clever, Smart & Very, Very Interesting
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,8,This film grew on me.I got involved and intrigued as it developed.I felt it was really well portrayed and accomplished.
" Just not right.
",2021-02-23 00:00:00,4,"This is one of those films that leaves you annoyed for having kept faith and watched it to the end.As has been expressed by other reviewers here, this film doesn't work on many levels. The script and direction leave much to be desired, we don't really see what's going on in the protagonist's head - you're thinking ""Surely he knows he's being worked, right?""...but we don't really know, because having a film based on a dialogue is a hard act, this often looks like a doctor and patient interview. The acting is so so, and the director should have fleshed the story better.There are lots of useless or shorthand lazy scenes to denote ""marriage"" and ""home life""- they hardly talk- but those scenes don't cement a relationship in the viewer's mind, nor move the story forward. There are so many build ups that never materialise into anything or perhaps they do but they walked past me. The story premise is fluffed out to string a story together which wants to have something huge to deliver, but just fizzles out from lack of direction, but ...still, it leaves you wondering what is was all about.This might have been an intesting 30-45 minute documentary and perhaps the book reads better."
" Disappointing
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,6,"I had high hopes going into this, and was quite interested to see James Franco and Jonah Hill act opposite each other in serious roles. Unfortunately, this film failed to deliver pretty much across the board.The performances from both Franco and Hill were very flat and hollow. Neither of them shone in this film, in fact it was Felicity Jones who gave the best performance. This is a great shame as both of them are fantastic actors, and have proven themselves capable of tackling meaty dramatic roles. They just didn't really turn up for this one, and seemed to be going through the motions.I also think there's an inherent lack of intrigue in this story. No amount of revolutionary film making could turn this plot into a thrilling and worthwhile film. The story always promised to be more twisty, more surprising and more entertaining than it was. I was expecting a psychological thriller, but got no such thing from this screenplay. The relationship between the two characters didn't seem that deep or complex, and was all pretty superficial.It is a pretty bizarre and macabre story I'll admit, but maybe one that is better confined to an hour long edition of a true crime documentary series than a feature film.Still worthy of a 6 though in my opinion, purely because it is a strange story which I did enjoy learning about. It's also relatively short which does it no end of good."
" First half is great, second half is just a slow, boring conclusion
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,6,"Everything about this movie is great: acting, directing, and even writing. However, there is only so much embellishment you can do when you're making a movie from a true story (wink wink) that is just not all that interesting in the end. The build up from the first half of the movie was fantastic and I was sure I'd rate this an 8 or 9, but despite everybody's best efforts it just falls flat and so 6/10 is where it lands. If you're going in fully aware of this, you might still enjoy most of it though, and make your own decision."
" Meaningless
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,5,"I was expecting this movie to be interesting, as it is based on a true story and the casting seems strong. To my disappointment, the movie was extremely boring.
I was anxiously waiting for a plot twist near the end because I didn't know the real story, but nothing happened. I find this movie meaningless, as it takes more than a true story, to make a good film.
The casting was weaker than I expected. I like James Franko and Jonah Hill, but their acting wasn't remarkable.
The director didn't do a good job eather. There were some hidden meanings at some points, that didn't mean anything at the end, like ""the wink"". I found some scenes poorly made, like the one that Jonah Hill is lying in bed and he thinks of what James Franko has lied about.
Anyway, I don't suggest this movie. You can find some really good ones that have to do with crimes and prisoners, this one was a disappointment."
" Do not waste your time
",2020-11-16 00:00:00,3,"After I watched True Story, I had only one question: What's the point of this movie?Seriously, there are no mistery, no twist, no drama, no story... No nothing. Movie could be about any average person and you couldn't tell the difference."
" Thrilling plot, wasted potential
",2020-10-23 00:00:00,6,"True story is a movie based on true events about the journalist Michael Finkel (Jonah Hill) and the in prison sitting Christian Longos (James Franco). The story was completely new for me. I have never heard about the storyline before, nor about the two real characters.The movie is staged in an exciting way from beginning to end. You never really know who is telling the truth, who is lying and in which direction the movie is going. I was positively surprised how much I liked watching.Jonah Hill & James Franco have convinced in their roles. There is nothing to criticize in terms of acting. Despite its short running time, the movie manages to build up a certain bond with the characters. That sounds good at first, but when you think about it for a while, a lot of things are very superficial.During the movie it was mentioned several times how much the two main characters have in common and how they depend on each other. This was said, but it was neither perceivable nor feelable.Unfortunately, the ending was not satisfying for me. I just thought, that's it? You were put before accomplished facts. I thought for most of the movie that it was about finding out whether Christian Longos was guilty or not. But in the end I had the feeling that this was incidental and that it was primarily about the relationship between the main characters. For me it was not developed why the two have such a bond to each other.The movie is rather short with a length of 99 minutes. In my opinion it would have been good for the movie to have 20 minutes more to deal with the relationship between the two main characters.All in all it is an average good film which is worth to watch."
" A good crime thriller
",2020-10-05 00:00:00,7,"I've been reading a lot of reviews here talking about how this movie is basically a build up with no pay off.
While I agree with the build up part, I might have to disagree with the latter.
This is a true story about a disgraced top journalist who then will befriend an accused murderer. The journalist Mike, played by Jonah hill became intrigued when he finds out that Longo, played by James Franco has been using his name for an alias. The two meet up and Mike sensing a big story for his come back from disgrace, befriended Longo with the incentive of helping him with his writing. So then they would correspondence with each other but without ever establishing that Longo is guilty. Mike even think that he's innocent.Things then took a turn when Longo pleads guilty to two counts of murders out of four counts, with the intention of manipulating the court. From this point on, this to me was the pay off. The moment Longo testifies about what happened on the night of the murders, we the viewers as well as our main character Mike, realised that we have been manipulated all along by Longo. All this time Mike has been teaching him about storytelling and Longo used that to his advantage. When Mike realised what's truly happening, Longo turned around to face mike. With a little shrug, a wink and a slight smile, he realized he was fooled, its like someone douse him with cold water, the realization is sobering. This was a very good scene, and to me, a pay off doesn't always have to be grand or climactic, a little moment like this could have just as much of a punch as a big moment.I especially enjoyed the last 30 minutes of this movie. This movie is worth to watch if you enjoyed crime thriller."
" Jonah Hill is amazing actor
",2020-09-23 00:00:00,5,"I decided to watch this movie even I knew about it's story and after read all bad comments written here because of Hill , he is not just comedian he proved he could act in different roles also ,best movie choice for those who likes mental dialogues during the scenes of movies."
" True Story
",2020-09-02 00:00:00,5,Jonah Hill and James Franco in this roll did not make much sense. Movie has some interesting parts but overall the movie falls flat.
" Different kind of murder story
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,7,"The true tale of Michael Finkel and Christian Longo, i.e., the journalist and the murderer who impersonated him before he was locked up. A riveting telling of a complex story in an easy to follow format. In other words this movie is a good time. It's a wonderfully strange story, or would be if no murders were involved, but, alas, there are four desperately wrong and heartbreaking murders. I was a teensy bit put off by the over-micing of James Franco's every breath and swallow. Certainly that was not enough to deter the movie and its message."
" Not good guys
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,2,"One dimensional acting, fill in the blanks kind of court room drama. A very unrealistic court room. A poor performance by James Franco who's only act is to show scruffy untidy facial hair and constantly swallow air. The ridiculous anticlimax ending,I thought at the start we were in for something great.Was I wrongDon't waste your timeToo many cliches about media posting rubbish things Not getting facts correctLet me tell you the real message of thisSexism and manipulationAnd this is why these days it goesWomen

" Terrible terrible pointless movie
",2020-06-29 00:00:00,1,Please don't watch and waste your time. Simply nothing interesting about the movie.
" Worth the watch (But i called it, *SPOILERS*)
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,7,"I like both the leads which was a bonus, I'd never heard of the film or the events it depicts so the story was fresh to me. If you're going in the same as me I'd advise you don't research it before hand (literally just finished it on Netflix and I'm about to read the wiki articles now).It's a good film but with kind of semi-predictable twists. Decent thriller/drama.*SPOILERS*When the crime is first talked about, straight away I said ""I bet it's like Shutter Island, the Wife did it and he killed her"".So I almost called it... Time to look up when Shutter Island was first written to see if it pre-dates the real life events..."
" Very disappointing
",2020-06-04 00:00:00,4,Honestly a waste of time. I Read that this movie would be mind blowing and twisted but it was none of that. It was very slow and overall disappointing. If you want to watch it because it's a true story go ahead but if you want to watch it for the thriller and excitement of watching a twisted murderer then don't bother.
" Good
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,6,Some if the reviews are a bit harsh... good but not great
" What a strange movie
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,4,"This is a very odd movie. The performances by Jonah Hill and Janes Franco are excellent. The look of the film is lovely. What is missing is the story.When I watched this it is as though the actors and the director know what the story is but in the process of making the movie they forgot about telling us.Whilst it could be argued that it's the tale of a disgraced journalist who gets a chance to be on the inside story with a suspected multiple murderer. His redemption in his professional field we can say. What it ends up being is a story of his impassion, the killers psychotic lies and really that is it.My lasting feeling was 'so what?'. If that is the film of a book then either the book was not worth filming or it's point has been missed completely"
" Good story build up, mediocre end
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,6,"Iwas expecting a 'Primal Fear' like ending, but left disappointed. The story build up was too good, but in the end it's just a mediocre film."
" Read the review, I explain why 4
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,4,"Of course 4 first of all because of the number of people he murdered.
This movie disturbed me, a lot. All those mind games he plays with the journalist. All the lies and the constant wondering ""is he telling the truth or a lie?"". I think james franco and of course the writers have done brilliant acting and choises. Franco tells us very little with his body language. Only at the end, with ""the wink"" (brilliant) we know he is a manipulator. A minute you think he is lying, and the minute after you think he is innocent. At least this is what I thought. And this is the disturbing point. What I would have think if I were in the journalist's shoes? Belive him or not?
At the end he is a narcisist. He wanted all the eyes on him, especially the journalist's eyes. And he had it. He had the book and he also had the movie. In his ill mind, he won. And this is why I give 4 stars. I think the movie is brilliant, but I don't want to grow the movie's ratings, I don't want people to see his story. This is what he always wanted. Attention. Sorry to the producers and actors."
" A very good written story !!
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,7,"I have never heard of the real life story behind the film and have not read the book. This film had brilliant storytelling with amazing performances by James Franco and Jonah Hill as the leading actors. I wouldn't pay any attention to the low rating and the negative comments it was truly a good drama, biography, thriller film. It was A bit slow going at first but stick with it and it gets better. I throughly enjoy it"
" Excellent
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,8,"A very interesting and engaging story that continued to surprise me throughout has been depicted well here. Good cast and acting, I especially enjoyed James Franco's performance."
" A true look into the mind..
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,8,"This film is truely a cinematic experience , it was originally a book first , so reading it is a recommendation (including myself)The way their friendship formed was unusual but equally fascinating with the similarities between them. I interpreted this to be the hook , a catalyst for the events that followed. This film is a great example of the thought process of a serial killer.Jonah Hill who played Michael I believe wasn't overly a great example for the character he was playing due to personal preference, but maybe it was the sheepish demeanor and vulnerability he displayed. On the other hand James Franco who played Christian I found captivating, the use of manipulation to gain trust through vocabulary and conduct , ultimately fooling others. This is solely what I experienced from the film so reading the book could give a different option.As most films go from the last century they tend to be slow to begin with but a fair chance should be given for this one. Overall if you have a strong sense of curiosity of how the mind works and/or an interest in serial killers then this film could be you."
" dont watch it
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,2,Absolute waste of time. absolute. it just didnt end up anywhere. there are so many things that doesnt make sense.i mean what's the message? what is it trying to say to us? and unnecessarily long and unmeaningful scenes...one of the biggest reasons of why it is a waste of time.
" Not for people with ADD
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,7,"I cannot grasp how anyone may find this chilling thriller based on real events ""boring"", so it seems that this movie is not made for those with Attention Deficit Disorder. The acting is decent and the storytelling quite interesting. It's definitely worth watching, specially if you are interested in psychology."
" More than I expected
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,9,"Very good movie! I saw these user comments here and almost haven't watched it, but totally worth my time. It was written perfectly, and the movie has the perfect duration. Super recommended!"
" Great cast, good story, but unlikeable characters.
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,6,"TRUE STORY is a true story.First: the reviewers who say that this has no ""payoff"" or that it doesn't have a point, seem to forget what this is actually about: a true story, told by a journalist that is thought by everyone that he can't write one.The payoff is big, for Finkel.This film is a slow burning drama with thriller elements. With lesser known cast it would have been a TV-movie, or a miniseries.Jonah Hill and James Franco shine, however, and they do it because of the script. The screenplay is powerful and so is also their performance, the direction and the production itself.Felicity Jones as the journalist Finkel's wife (Jill) is underused, though, and the writing of her character is not as strong as the others. It doesn't matter, since this is mainly a story about Finkel and Longo.The biggest problem with this movie, and this is the reason why I give it a 6, is that the characters are simply not likeable. What these people did is almost unforgivable, and they don't seem to understand when to stop.TRUE STORY becomes a circus show of egoism, and as such it's a powerful view of our media landscape, and that there are simply no bounderies left.Simply put: I don't care for Finkel and I don't care for Longo."
" A great psychological story but average movie
",2020-01-17 00:00:00,6,"I found the story really interesting and had high potentials but seems that the movie did not capitalize and bring the best of it.I am not sure if the casting choice was right. I couldn't take Hill or Franco seriously at times. Also, the writing seems rushed. The interviews could have been more. The interactions and conversations between Finkel and Logan were too few and, I did not feel their connection grow. Logan seemed like a close acquaintance at best while, in real life they were both still in contact to this day as the movie mentioned in the end. (or at least till 2015).The fact that they were still in contact was the main highlight for me and what I thought was really interesting. And that was only a written text at the end of the movie. Seeming that I was surprised that they have this kind of connection in real life, the movie didn't do a good job."
" An incomplete approach to a true story
",2020-01-01 00:00:00,4,"Admittedly, the nature of the story seems pretty compelling at first, making you curious about how the plot will evolve. Adding to that, the character development seems rather adequate, preparing you for the upcoming trial.However, the whole story actually becomes a little dull, especially towards the end.The most anticipated moment of the movie -the trial- ends in the most predictable manner;It just corroborates what we knew from the beginning, without adding anything to the plot. But most importantly,the actual connection of the two protagonists is never explained. Nor do we understand their supposed ""resemblance"" or the reason why Logo chose to impersonate Finkel. Last but not least, the reason why Finkel kept in touch with Logo after the trial -despite Michael's repulsion for Logo- is never mentioned."
" Not a true story
",2019-12-24 00:00:00,3,"Not a story, actually. James Franco acts very badly, and Jonah Hill doesn't act at all."
" Gripping
",2019-11-04 00:00:00,9,"I stumbled on Netflix over true story and was surprised this movie is pretty much unknown and didn't win big awards. Well, maybe that's already a good sign nowadays as True story stands out positively in the sea of pointless and overconstructed flicks. Life tells the best stories and this amazing thriller proves this saying again on so many levels. It's sad, shocking, disturbing, frightening how quickly life can change and ultimately collapse. James Franco delivers again an outstanding performance! Is the portrayed character the victim or the villain? Do u sympathize or loathe him? Who and even more important what to believe? Who to turn to when everything runs out of control? The movie leaves u alone with some of these questions which makes TS even more impactful. Highly recommended."
" no tension
",2019-09-20 00:00:00,5,"New York Times reporter Michael Finkel (Jonah Hill) gets the front page but his story turns out to be a false amalgamation of different people. He gets fired in disgrace. Nobody is willing to hire him. Then he gets a call from a local Oregon reporter Pat Frato (Ethan Suplee). Christian Longo (James Franco) has been arrested for the murder of his wife and three children. Unbeknownst to him, Christian has been using his identity. Christian grants him exclusive access.At no time did I think that Christian is innocent. At best, the circumstance of the murders could be interesting but Franco plays him guilty from the very beginning. With no mystery, the question becomes where the tension of the movie would come from. The theme of truth is useful with Finkel's constant modification of his relationship with the concept. Even there, losing the book deal is not enough to inject the necessary tension. Although the movie floats the idea, Christian is never threatened with release. There is simply no danger of anything. At best, it's a character study but Finkel needs to have a darker treatment. This is an intriguing story that comes to not much."
" Underrated gem
",2019-09-06 00:00:00,8,"This is an outstanding film in a sea of mediocre rubbish, a great performance by Franco, hill and Jones.
It's interesting from beginning till the end"
" Pointless!
",2019-09-05 00:00:00,3,What's the point of this story? What's the point or gain from being inspired from true events? I don't know!
" Don't waste your time
",2019-08-31 00:00:00,1,"This story starts of good and you wonder all the different ways it can end but then nothing happens. When I say nothing happens I mean nothing happens, there's no end, no conclusion, no review for watching. This is so bad I can write a better ending."
" Promising movie which in the end did not deliver
",2019-08-14 00:00:00,6,"3/4th of the movie was such a philologically complex story with a great potential. I was thinking all of the possible options what could happen in the end. Did Christian Longo murder his whole family? Was there someone else helping him? Was Jill the one who was helping Christian? Does Michael Finkel find himself after talking to Christian? But, the ending with the last quarter of the movie was such a disappointment. I was expecting so much more because all of the movie lead me to belive something mind-blowing will happen.
At his book publishing with the Q/A, Mike 'saw' Christian there asking him a question which I didn't even get. If it wouldn't be the Q/A with Christian appearing there, it would end better."
" Doesn't match the expectations
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,5,"This movie is certainly out of the ordinary, doesn't fit in with the other movies of this type. It doesn't build drama or tension, and the only interesting part of it is that it makes you wonder until the very end if Christian Longo, played by James Franco is or isn't guilty of the crimes. The actors played their parts amazingly, a great performance from all of them, highlighting James Franco and Jonah Hill. On the other hand, the movie overall lacks action, something that glues you to the screen, as it is pretty dull. The story of Christian is interesting and so is the fact that him and Michael are so similar in such different ways, but it didn't deserve it's own movie, the whole point of it could've been made in about 10 minutes. It certainly isn't a bad movie, but it's definitely not one you need to watch."
" A good enough film, but full of holes
",2019-07-14 00:00:00,4,"1. Why did Longo suddenly decide to call himself 'Mike Finkel'? Unexplained.
2. How did Longo manage to produce a great pile of notes in prison, which turned out to look exactly like those Finkel produced in Africa? Unexplained.
3. In Longo's written life story, he says he was brought up as a Jehovah's Witness, and draws pictures of the JWs gathered beneath a crucifix at a meeting. JWs do not believe in the 'crucifixion' of Jesus, but in his death on a 'torture stake.' They never display a cross at a meeting.
4. There is no explanation for the murders Longo committed. No portrayal of his life or background.I don't trust Longo or Mike Finkel. I suppose I ought to read the book on which it is based, but I don't know if I've got the time. A fine film, but nevertheless one that is flat and about nothing much."
" Character dependent without enough substance
",2019-07-13 00:00:00,6,"Based on the infamous serial killer story, Jonah Hill, staring along James Franco, delivers a thrilling and engaging portrayal of the main characters, attached by a compelling and, at times, truly unsettling story that focuses on the potential it's drama and intrigue is capable of offering, depending mostly on the way things are narrated, but unfortunately, and while there's a visual engagement towards the viewer, this thriller doesn't necessary surpasses flicks with better execution and the same premise."
" A True Story doesn't necessarily make a good movie story. Nothing wrong with it, but kind of underwhelming
",2019-07-09 00:00:00,6,"I really enjoyed the performances of Jonah Hill and James Franco. Both can show their acting talents in this one.
But the whole story is kind of leading to nowhere. There is just not much to be really glued to the screen.
The story seems more like a personal therapy for being led astray.Watch it if you are a fan of either or both the lead actors.6/10"
" my notes
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,5,"Pretty interesting story but slow at times and I had some issues with how it was done (1 viewing)
SPOILERS
they kept implying that there was going to be some big reveal or secret. when it turned out to be a lie I was a little disappointed. even tho it's kind of a cool unexpected mini twist that he was really just manipulating him the whole time, my curiosity for what really happened was not satisfied. also they kept showing finkel's wife as if she had something to do with the crime or the supposed secret, when it turns out she was just interested in the case and had some mean things to say to him at the end. major disappointment on that front"
" Don't get fooled by the average rating
",2019-05-29 00:00:00,8,"I seriously can not understand how the average rating can be so low. Remarkable!According to me, Jonah Hill is an AMAZING actor and will win his Oscar very soon. Although, in this one; James Franco outshine him, didn't see that coming. Both are doing a great job which lifts the movie overall.The movie itself is actually really good. Great storytelling and perfectly balanced pace from the beginning to the end.After the ending scenes the movie lives in your thoughts and you still can't really place you finger on Franco's character.BUT, if it wasn't for the amazing job that Hill and Franco did it would probably be a ""7"" instead of ""8"" for me."
" ""The truth ALWAYS matters""
",2019-04-21 00:00:00,4,"In a sense, star reporter Michael Finkel was accused of killing the truth -- by taking facts from disparate sources and combining them into a single character for a front-page story in the New York Times Magazine.Christian Longo was charged with literal murder in the slayings of his wife and three children.Through a series of unlikely events, these two become friends and confidantes, and ""True Story"" tries to tell the saga of how it all shook out.
Unfortunately, the movie doesn't hold together very well.One big problem is the casting of Jonah Hill as Finkel. From what I've read, Hill is more of a comedic actor, and he's never quite believable as a masterful wordsmith. His interactions with everyone in this narrative, from his editors at the Times, to his wife and even to Longo, don't ever seem to click emotionally.James Franco does manage to create a compelling presence as eventual Death Row resident Longo, and you do find yourself hanging on most of what he says. However, this is probably related to the fact that Franco is a very attractive man.Overly long stretches of this film are devoted to tangential characters like Finkel's wife and a dogged investigator, and there is an atmospheric but irrelevant sketch involving Longo's last days of freedom in Mexico. None of this screen time does much to advance the story or add depth to characterization. Just as Finkel took his readers for a ride, this film may leave viewers feeling cheated."
" Outstanding
",2019-03-13 00:00:00,10,This is an outstanding movie in every respect. The acting is brilliant & James Franco is incredible in his role. Well worth checking out.
" Average rating is not representative
",2019-02-22 00:00:00,9,"This movie is definitely one of my favorite movies, I don't really understand why everyone is going so hard on this movie.In my opinion the atmosphere in the movie is just straight out perfect, most of the times there are no sound effects, which makes the movie feel close to reality. Background music is almost never used, except from the scene where Jill meets Longo. This scene is one of the many scenes where the tension gets so tight it almost feels like you are part of the story.The continuity of questions being rased by Longo and Finkel their acts is just crazy. Every time you think you are close to finding the answer to these questions, you find out that you are completely wrong.The comparison between Longo and Finkel is also something to look at. At what aspects are they the same, and at what aspects are they different? Do this comparisons make them different from each other, or do they make them the same? And so on...Altogether, this movie does not end when the playing on the screen is over, it keeps living on in your mind."
" Badly directed, not recommend
",2019-02-14 00:00:00,3,"So in short, this movie is another wasted hour of my life. Director obviuosly did not know how to master this film, scenes badly stick together, movie temp is jumping all the time, characters are undeveloped, one moment you think thay are smart and in another- stupid as a patatoe. If you watch half of a movie, then you will be half dissapointed, but if you watch all movie, then you get a full dissopointment experience."
" Exceptional story and intriguing
",2019-02-07 00:00:00,9,"Really, really good film, kept me focussed, how does this only get 6.3 rating, 9 easily"
" Better then expected
",2019-01-25 00:00:00,8,Very compelling movie. Deserves more credit than the current rating.
" ""Everybody deserves to have their story heard.""
",2019-01-22 00:00:00,7,"The most interesting part of the movie was the courtroom scene in which Christian Longo (James Franco) pleads guilty to two murders, and innocent to the other two, all members of his own family. As the viewer, the wheels begin to turn as to what Longo's motivation and obfuscation are all about. I had a pretty good idea he was going to place his wife right in the middle of the murder scenario, and the way he laid it out, it could have been credible. Except the guy was a first class liar from the word 'go', and it took a while for Michael Finkel (Jonah Hill) to sort it all out. Longo was a great manipulator, as evidenced by the phone call with Jill (Felicity Jones) in which he tried to sweet talk another angle into getting Finkel to believe his story. I thought it was great when Jill showed up at the prison and slammed him hard for his deceit. By the end of the picture, it wasn't much of a surprise to learn that Longo did in fact, kill his entire family. But I guess the most amazing aspect of the film for me didn't have anything to do with Longo at all, it was the reason for Finkel losing his job at the New York Times. Journalistic integrity? From the newspaper that salts it's columns with statements like 'If it's true' and 'as yet we have not been able to verify'. I couldn't suppress laughing out loud."
" Top-notch performances
",2019-01-22 00:00:00,8,I hadn't seen this movie before I saw Maniac. Jonah hill was so impressive in that series that I was really excited to watch this movie. Jonah hill gives out a beautiful heartfelt performance. James Franco also does really well to portray Christian Longo . The movie leaves you an impact and it is horrifying to see the scenes showing the murders. They are not graphic but very difficult to watch.
" Yawn
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,4,"That was really really boring, it never drew me in was really slow and just Dam right boring."
" Not true
",2019-01-07 00:00:00,6,The part where the wife cones to prison to talk to longo and plays the music with the story from the early 1600s about the composer killing his wife her lover then bashing his newborn child head against the side of his crib till death isn't true. Yes he killed the wife and her lover but wow talk about adding some b.s. with the killing the newborn son. The child died as a grown man and it wasn't at the hands of his father. As a matter of fact the gather died 3 weeks after his child. This is called true story and they make up such a big lie what else is complete b.s. in this story
" Time loss
",2019-01-06 00:00:00,4,"Very interesting start but going nowhere; there is nothing to be filmed about this. There is nothing to be published also. Why? Why there should be a book of a killer? Why a journalist must see a killer and sees this as an oppurnity of this?
Seriously ask yourselves, a killer (or innocent as he can prove), only to see his/her lawyer and made their defence. This is the nature of it. Why the journalist or even his wife goes to see him in jail? Just for money for the next book.
In the end, we should not see it;
Avoid if you can; regarda"
" Could be more but still good
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,7,It had the potential to be much more with the compelling story it had. It did keep me interested all the way through though. Fine acting by both Hill and Franco. Felicity Jones' role as Hill's wife was incredibly useless and felt awkward the entire movie.The true story of the relationship between a journalist and a guy who killed his wife and 3 children.
" What's It Like to Be Married To, Child Of, Murder Victim of Psychopath?
",2018-11-06 00:00:00,1,"Oh I guess that what be a real drama, a real tragedy. Easy to imagine that roller coaster ride. The pressure, the fighting, the harrowing moments punctuated by some good times and even fun. And finally the end game. But instead we have yet another unintentional expose of media corruption and exploitation. Well softa. It's hard to put lipstick on these pigs. It's Russian Dolls + Mirrors. Exploitation of exploitation of exploitation.....But bottom line if the real story is pretext you're being played."
" A tour de force on acting
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,5,"True story it's not a great film, since it's based on a true story about a reporter whose identity is stolen by a killer, and when he is get in touch with the murder starts a strange relationship in order to write a book about the crimes of his new and strange pal. The result is a book that names as the film: True story. As a movie storytelling, ""True story"" has no surprises, except the presence of James Franco and Jonah Hill, to whom many can relate more with dumb comedy that with a serious film about killers. The movie is quite plane, since there are no flashbacks or surprising twists that you can never imagine. What it makes so compelling is the acting. At first, Jonah Hill embodies a normal character, New York Times reporter Michael Finkel, who is in to an ordeal and a personal crisis when he faces Christian Longo, embodied by Franco, a killer arrested in Cancun, Mexico, deported to the US in order to be judged. Longo's character is first presented as a naive man who seems not to kill even a fly, but his evil character is gradually unfolded by a masterful James Franco impersonification, and in the end, that naive character of the beginning turns to be a real demon, and James Franco delivers a hell of a performing on the construction of such a character. Its so impressive what he does on screen that when you realize the very soul of the killer you are complete forget that you are no longer watching a comedy actor but a SERIOUS actor. This is a masterclass on acting. And that is what makes this film so unexpected. This film is all about acting, not about the script or any other circumstances. It's probably that many think that Franco as the killer its gonna be a poor and comic rendition of his character. NFW. This is one of his most impressive performances that leave you with such a horror felling inside that you can't believe the tour de force he is delivering on here. Acting on here is everything. The eveil on Longo's character remember other similar crime portrayal's such Hannibal Lecter or John Doe's Seven.Acting: 10
Filming: 5"
" Started great but stooped low at the end
",2018-04-13 00:00:00,6,"The start was awesome , there was the suspense going through till the halfway then suddenly the ending was all clearly visible to the viewers and yes it is based on a true story but who cares unless it's not an awe inspiring one, to be honest....P.S: It's watchable"
" The movie hooked me as much as Longo hooked Finkel
",2018-01-03 00:00:00,9,"I just bumped into this film on HBO. I had never heard of it or read reviews, but the premise and the actors led me to stick around for a few minutes . . . and then for the whole duration. I found the film absorbing and gripping. Franco, especially in those close-ups in the prison interview room, mesmerizes just as Longo must have done in reality. If we never find out all the whys we'd love to understand, that's because this is a true story, and life just doesn't answer all the questions that screenwriters of fiction can pen."
" Fails to convince as a character piece, but sizzles with tension as a work of true crime
",2017-12-10 00:00:00,5,"Based on the memoir of the same name by shamed ex-journalist Michael Finkel, Rupert Goold's True Story is a story of amazing coincidence and unexpected friendship, as two unrelated men from completely different backgrounds find their destinies intertwined. At its heart, this is a true-crime drama that flew under many people's radars, which is surprising given how audience interest in shocking tales of murder and the subsequent trials have been piqued by Netflix's many terrific documentaries. Yet the crime itself, which occurs before the film begins, isn't the main focus of True Story. Instead, we get a character piece centred on a busted writer who believes he has been given a second chance, and a man awaiting trial for the murder of his wife and three children.The film begins with Finkel (played by Jonah Hill) in Africa, interviewing various victims of modern-day slavery. He is seen as a future Pulitzer recipient by his bosses at the New York Times, and has seen many of his previous pieces grace the front page. He is soon brought back down to Earth when his editors confront him about creating a composite character for his latest story, and is soon fired. Other papers want nothing to do with him, so when he learns that a man wanted for murder named Christian Longo (James Franco) has been using his name before finally being arrested, he sees it as his opportunity to drag his name out of the mud. A fan of Finkel's work, Longo grants him exclusive rights to the story, and in return Finkel will teach him out to write, and promise not to publish anything until after the trial. The two become friends, with Finkel going so far as believing they are some kind of kindred spirits.A lot of time is spent with the two characters simply talking in a room, and it's a nice surprise that theatre director Goold manages to avoid a stagey feel. But what goes down within the prison's visiting room fails to convince as one would expect from such seasoned actors. Franco puts his half-closed eyes and charming smile to good use, but you rarely get the sense that Hill is a writer capable of reaching the dizzy heights of wunderkind status at the New York Times, and he always feels two or three steps behind. As Finkel's wife, Felicity Jones is given little to do at first but gaze at her husband with concern as he pours over documents and Longo's extensive letters, before she locks horns with the slippery inmate himself. Yet these later dramatic scenes seem inserted to add unnecessary emotional drive, or to give the talented actress something to do. Nevertheless, this is an engaging retelling of a fascinating true story which sizzles with tension until the very end. Unless you already know the outcome of course."
" Psychological study
",2017-07-06 00:00:00,6,"""True Story"" from 2015 stars Jonah Hill and James Franco as writer Mike Finkel and killer Christian Longo, respectively.Finkel was a well-regarded journalist for the New York Times who fudged a story and combined five people into one, was caught, and was fired. He learns later that a man who murdered his wife and three children, Christian Longo, was caught in Mexico and was at the time using the name Mike Finkel. Intrigued, Finkel arranges a meeting.What follows is a bonding experience, where Longo claims to be a long-time fan of Finkel, and Finkel finds similarities between his own life and is impressed that he and Finkel even take similar types of notes. Longo asks that none of the information he gives Finkel be released until after the trial and promises him exclusivity. In exchange, Longo would like to learn to write the way that Finkel can and asks for pointers.Finkel begins to believe that Longo is covering someone and doubts his guilt. He also realizes that the story is more than article -it's a book.It's not until the trial that Finkel learns the true story.Good film about an actual case, but while it's effective, it doesn't have the bone-chilling quality it could have. The acting is good, particularly by Franco who has the showier role. The acting is done in a naturalistic style - a tiny bit more punch in a film like this might have helped as it lacks some necessary emotion.I think a stronger script or even more potent direction could have made this a truly devastating experience. As it is, it's interesting without being fascinating."
" A well told story, played brilliantly by Hill & Franco
",2017-06-22 00:00:00,8,"The movie blew straight past my expectations of a Jonah Hill and James Franco film. It was great to see the two playing such serious roles and the two of them really did a fantastic job. I loved the movie, very deep & emotional. The story was strong and the directing was A+. I'd love to see more films like this from the two, they are remarkable characters. Great Job!"
" One of the best movies I have seen
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,10,"This is a remarkable movie with some brilliant original new ideas.When the viewer finally realizes why things were done (and I don't want to add spoilers), he will uncover his own most inner aspirations and deepest wishes.This movie should be watched very carefully. It is not a standard action/drama thriller.Amazing."
" About a man who has nothing to lose and a man who can't afford another failure!
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,6,"It was based on the book of the same name, which was originally inspired by the real events. But there's a striking resemblance between this and the Truman Capote story. About a man who is serving in prison for slaying a family and his encounter with a reporter/writer. And so their relationship strengthens as they sit together to discuss about each others life event. That is the main film, which covers the majority of the film, but feels like they revealed nothing much, particularly for our convince, yet the story moved forward.For the Truman Capote, there are two films, including the one I liked 'Infamous' and the other one is 'Capote'. Besides these two, there's another title called 'In Cold Blood' that reveals the other side of the event, before Truman enters the scene. So that's what I'm interested after watching this film. Because right now they preferred to portray a struggling writer and the crime parts were not given any importance. That means it is basically about a reporter/writer doing a story/book.If they decide to make that one with the same cast as a prequel, then James Franco gets into an action which probably would give a good reason behind such crime where in this film the viewers can't end watching surely what really happened. Both, Jonah Hill and James Franco was really impressive in this. Felicity Jones had the small presence, but was in a main role. It was a feature film debut for the director and he was well managed to make it decently. Overall, for me, it was a good film, not the best, but can be watched once.6/10"
" True stories don't always make good movies.
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,5,"By the time I got around to seeing this, I forgot it was actually a true story, so my first reaction was ""This is a pretty lame script"".Given that it is based on a true story, I guess I can't fault it for not having any tidy plot twists or genuine payoff, because life isn't always like that. I'm the first on to complain when a movie add large fictional elements for the sake of a more exiting story (Joy, Sully, The Revenant, etc). Still, a completely faithful story doesn't always work as a movie. Basically, you have the odd detail of the accused killer using Finkel's name, but that comes out pretty early, and after that there are no surprises. Things just plod along inexorably toward a pretty obvious conclusion. The spoiler is that there are no spoilers.Not a terrible movie, but certainly not a great one."
