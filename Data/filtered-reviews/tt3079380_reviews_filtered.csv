" Bullying and Mindless Ranting
",2021-03-30 00:00:00,4,"If you think that bullying someone is funny then this film is for you as half the ""jokes"" are simply that. The other half is the lead character mindlessly talking as if there was no script.Redeeming qualities come at Jason Statham's over the top insane character and the general production quality. Not worth your time, watch the best bits on YouTube."
" Three pieces of advice
",2021-03-29 00:00:00,3,"To CIA: Ban your agents from chowing down on Big macs. It is better for their health and ensures they can move when needed.To Hollywood: throw in the towelTo audiences: we are not that desperate. Let's learn how to cook, take care of the lawn or repaint the house."
" This week the director of national intelligence determined..
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,2,That Russia interfered with the 2020 elections as they did in the 2016 elections.That explains this 'film'American intelligence services is so short staffed and intellectually challenged and rotten from the core that... they send this baffoon of a chubster who cannot even pick a monkey out of a line of elephants .. overseas on a mission!!I mean sure I buy that. NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
" Must have had money to burn
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,1,"A generally astonishingly accomplished cast burdened by a script suitable for wrapping fish.
Much of the cast are folks who I really like.
Probably OK for pre-teens and tweens except for the occasional drift into adult humor.Will require massive intoxication for actual adults to sit through or frequent recourse to small-screen news bulletins, calls from needy relatives, and the pressing need to clean the cat-box -- or other distractions like unplanned visits from the ex-spouse or religious zealots."
" 8
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,8,Really good movie and funny comedy. This actor is just amazing and needs more attention.
" A funny spy comedy.
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,8,"Paul Feig and Melissa McCarthy is back with Spy. As far as I can see, they have completely succeeded. Spy is one of my favorite action comedies, and should be well received.First time I saw this movie, I thought ""Alright. This is okay."" I didn't like it as much as I did the next times. I've recently watched the movie, and I thought ""This is pretty hilarious."" I laughed in almost every scene. Much of this movie is comedic genius, and made me laugh extremely hard.One of the reasons to this, is the cast. They are divided into two groups: Americans and Brits. Some is Americans and some is Brits. The Americans is Melissa McCarthy, Bobby Cannavale, Allisson Janney, and Morena Baccarin. The Brits is Jude Law, Jason Statham, Miranda Hart, and Peter Serafinowicz. And then, there's Rose Byrne as the Australian. Melissa McCarthy is as funny as she always is, and makes some of the best and funniest scenes in the movie. She plays the leading role perfectly. But the best performance in the movie, is by no doubt Jason Statham. He is the funniest he has ever been. And for a guy whose chasing and killing bad guys, and driving in car chases, he's pretty hilarious as the spy who wants to do everything himself.This is a very funny spy comedy which works pretty well, and I'm just waiting on the sequel (please, let it be). The only bad thing in the movie, is that I see potensial several places where the movie could have been better. But it doesn't do what you'd expect sometimes, and it's a little bit irritating. I like this movie very much, but it isn't near the top of the list. But if you want some fun, this is a solid recommendation."
" Hilarious
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,10,"Hilarious, dry humor, stupidity and easy to watch and relax with a glass of wine!! Thank you thank you"
" This is a hilarious film
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,9,This film is really funny but has got a lot of swearing and rude bits in it.
" Sorry I missed it, this was funny and enjoyable.
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,7,"Just go along and have some Fun with it. The writing works well with some really funny one liners and the placement and execution are very well done. Melissa did a very good job in delivery, I have to look at more of what she's done so, put your thinking caps 'off' and just enjoy this. I did and will look forward to the 2nd installment though I'm not a fan of them and, they usually Suck. Good job on all, it was a fun ride."
" Good fun
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,8,"Not sure what people were expecting from this, it's a no nonsense, straight up action comedy.. The casting is great, plot is good fun and simple. The only spy movies I enjoy are comedy ones and this fits that nicely. Alot of physical comedy. Melissa and Jason in particular are great fun to watch..
If your after a good laugh then this ticks that box."
" Amusing high spy jinks
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,7,"This is an enjoyable spy caper. It would be easy to call it a spoof, but the story (full of twist and counter-twist) stands up on its own, and isn't just a scaffold for the jokes.And a lot of those jokes work really well. Statham in particular raises a lot of laughs playing an absurdly tough tough guy, McCarthy is likable and sharp witted, and some of the sight gags are superbly crafted. There is great choreography on show in the fight scenes too.But it is not without its weaknesses. Jude Law plays American (badly) and lacks charm in a thin role. Rose Byrne is shrill. Peter Serafinowicz is as hammy and unfunny as ever. At least Miranda Hart is bearable until some very tacky scenes with a guest star.With a better supporting cast, this could have been quite special. As it stands, it's worth watching, but not something I'll be rushing to watch again."
" OMG this movie is so friggin' funny!
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,10,"For me, its all about the chemistry of the actors and Jason Statham and Melissa McCarthy had a ton of it. Ummmmmmmmm.... where's the sequel? It is the time for it!!!"
" Jason StatHAM and MeLICKa BIG MACarthy
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,2,"I suspect this film was produced by Dick Cheney.
It involved the CIA and the waterboarding and torture of... the audience."
" laugh out loud
",2020-12-25 00:00:00,8,"With all these 1 marks I was not looking forward to the family choice of christmas day movie. However the slapstick comedy had me laughing out loud, a bit crude at times but that just made it funnier. could possibly have gave it 9 but only casino and once upon a time in America ever got a 10"
" After Around 15 Minutes
",2020-12-25 00:00:00,3,"I was willing to give this a fair play.My will soon wained.
Maybe I missed out.I wasn't patient or persistent enough to stay with this for long."
" OMG, long time I laughed so much
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,10,"OMG, where do I start. It's been a while since a movie made me laugh so much. Melissa McCarthy is absolutely and utterly hilarious in this movie. She really was spot on, her timing perfect, I enjoyed every minute of her acting. She nailed the role. In short she is comedy gold.I also loved the satirical take of the James Bond & Co classics and how it poignantly exposes these classic spy movies for what they really are: misogynistic wet dream escapes for beta males - the butt hurt reaction in many reviews here prove this point to perfection.McCarty's character is the complete anti-thesis to the sleek, marvelous looking, greater-than-life male spy characters we have been accustomed to. The evolvement of her character from the classic female supporter role, we also are accustomed to in fex. Ms. Moneypenny, to the bad-ass, hyper qualified spy, who still is not taken seriously by any of her colleagues despite of all her accolades, is unfortunately a role many women still can identify with, and it is a real treat to follow her metamorphosis. Which for me makes this one of the best movies I've ever seen.So here's a tip, if you really enjoy watching classic spy movies, where women only act as eye candy or grey mice booking hotel rooms for the male super star, stay clear from this movie. If you are tired of the classic stereotypical spy movies and want to see a refreshing take on them, this is your film."
" Not An Action Movie And Not Funny
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,3,"Really pathetic.
McCarthy as a spook begs disbelief so the stars reflect that.
And what is with with CIA scene?? I guess it just worked better in their heads than it did on the screen.."
" Hi Paul Feig
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,3,Your films need to become better.May I suggest you go back to school? For 2 hours? Watch Super Size Me. OK?Spy must be financed by the Russian intelligence. How else could you explain the trash that masquerades as CIA?
" Entertaining and mostly funny
",2020-11-28 00:00:00,7,"Definitely not the best comedy around but it's entertaining enough and I got a few laughs out of it. Would be more of a 6/10 but the actors are all doing a great job, even if towards the end each of their respective shtick becomes a little repetitive. But it's still pretty entertaining overall."
" SpinOff Movie for Aldo...
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,9,"All of the parts and characters of the movie fit perfectly. The movie kept me laughing from beginning to end. However, the character Aldo played by Peter Serafinowicz steals the show. The spy character, Aldo should spin off into a full length spy movie."
" Never fails to make me laugh
",2020-11-10 00:00:00,8,"I think I've seen this about 5 times now and I still laughUnderdog creates a chance for herself as a spy. Cliched characters - Peter s Italian spy, Jason s plays himself hilariously - good silly entertainment
, some great lines, worth a watch"
" Oof.
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,10,"All the hate I'm seeing in the 1* reviews feels a bit biased. So for whatever it may be worth to someone here is a different ooinion ""I REALLY dig this movie.""
I've seen it many times now and I still laugh whenever I watch it. If you like ACTION COMEDIES and SPOOFS, then you might really like this... or not. Either way don't be afraid to give it a chance! It's nowhere near as bad as that ""ghostbusters"" travesty."
" I can not believe the bad reviews? You guys are high on something or what?
",2020-10-18 00:00:00,10,"This movie was fun as hell. I would give it a 8. But because of the bad reviews I have a 10 to balance out the points.Now, lets get to the movie, dont worry no spoilers. Look some people say that film is trying to be funny by using main characters fatness as a joke but no. This movie has a thousand jokes and the ones that are about fatness are just some of them.This movie made me laugh like I didnt for months. I really enjoyed the it and I even reccomended to some of my friends and they really like it too. Than I made my bigger brother watch it and he liked it as hell too. So I dont get it why these people didnt love this movie and giving it a 1 or 2 points? Really guys? What were you expecting before watching it? This is a COMEDY movie. It has all kinds of jokes and I laughed in almost every 5 minutes. Good job and congrats to everyone who worked in this movie."
" Just Go For A Walk Instead
",2020-10-08 00:00:00,2,Not even the alluring Rose Byrne could save this. And I really do not refer or imply anything with female lead roles. If you want to make a serious case for strong female CIA agents then please do not do it like this. Just a bad movie. Two stars because of a couple of relatively pretty and thin actresses.
" Anyone who gave this a 1.....
",2020-10-05 00:00:00,7,"Probably gives movies like, 'Not another teen movie, Vampires suck, Epic movie, Meet the Spartans' ...all 10's.This movie is not the perfect comedy, but it's pretty F*#king funny!!"
" I spy with my little eye
",2020-10-01 00:00:00,7,Some funny moments throughout as long as you don't take it too serious. Jason Statham alone was worth 3 stars. Great to see someone take the P out of themselves
" Jayson stat ham
",2020-09-22 00:00:00,3,"Movie looks boring? Yes it looks like it. Villains are terrible. Melisa muccarthey is funny no doubt. Was it good ? Meh. Jason Statham makes this movie funny oh man. I wasnt expecting jason statham would carry the movie. Actually he carried the movie snatch too so he is good at weird acting. I watched til the end but totally useless characters, also needless main character just to keep movie long, it would be way better as a 1 hour movie, also nonesense bat and rat scenes. Boobholder man was also needless. Tall girl was useless/ not funny. They paid a lot on actresses and actors but storyline is very bad. I wish they would pay more for writers. I laughed 3-5 times. I guess girls would laugh more. +1 star for rose buuurn(my love) + 1 star for jay +1 for McCarthy. Watch if you have time to burn."
" It is so embarrassing you almost fall for it
",2020-09-18 00:00:00,3,"Waste of time! I was waiting for some suspense. Despite the bad reviews I liked to give it a chance but alas. James Bond is better, anything is better. I just saw a shopaholic woman trying to be gross. Apparently, at CIA school they teach that you can defeat the enemy by being stupid or unfunny or ironic. I guess the director wanted to give it a serious ending, but I think it would be better with a little more realism."
" Fantastic Action Comedy
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,8,"Not only is this movie hilarious but it stands on its own as a legitimate action film. Well written, perfectly cast, I love watching this movie - it's a ton of fun!"
" Exciting, funny, and fresh
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,9,"The 1-star reviews can't be serious; this is a very good movie that I thoroughly enjoyed with its energy, humor, characters, and plenty of fight/chase scenes. Yes, there's swearing, violence, and a briefly cringe-worthy vomit scene, but honestly, they all work within the scenes and add to the movie. It also had a nice blend of both male and female actors, which is very refreshing to see in an action movie. There were a few times I would have preferred an alternate take (Susan enjoying the cat-callers, Aldo's unwanted advances, even Nancy's forceful attempts to kiss 50 Cent) but overall the majority of the movie feels competent and strong. I remember seeing it in the theater when it came out and have seen it a few more times at home. Every time I see it, I feel entertained and enjoy it."
" Where's the sequel?
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,9,"Writer/director Paul Feig and Melissa McCarthy make a great team. ""Spy"" is another example of how great they are when they work together. It's a very funny comedy wrapped around a good spy story. The action is both thrilling and funny. There are a bunch of laugh-out-loud moments. The cast is very good. They all do a solid job. I saw ""Spy"" in the theater (AMC Westbury, NY) and I've seen it quite a few times since. It never fails to hit the spot."
" A Fun and Funny Ride
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,8,Very fun movie here. Wonderful spoof of a genre I endlessly enjoy and Jason Statham and Jude Law both sell it. The women do have some flat moments but you can love them as real human beings. OK it's not Blazing Saddles but it is not a bad movie and deserves better than all the one stars it gets here. Way better.
" So Kevin James leaves the mall
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,3,And starts working for the CIA and gets a mission somewhere there is no Burger king or McDonalds and of course goes bazooka mad and is shaking and is out of his element.Fin
" how does anyone not give this a 10!?
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,10,"So funny! All the cliches ... with a twist. All the action... all the innuendos, spy thrills with frills. Female empowerment but with the added regular person empowerment!! This movie a real gem. I laughed out loud constantly! A classic movie!!"
" I don't what's with the bad reviews, this is the funniest movie I ever seen!
",2020-07-06 00:00:00,10,"I can't believe it got such bad reviews, good thing rotten tomatoes knows funny, good movies because this is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen! From beginning to end, I never got bored, there's no cheesy parts. All the characters are hilarious, especially Jason Statham! Even Rose Byrne is so funny, they all just play well off each other. Yes I know people see Melissa Mcarthy and automatically think it's dumb humor. But it's definitely not, even though she's the main character, all the characters are so beyond funny. There's no stupid dumb humor, it's all really funny. It does help the write did writing for the show office as well. I love how Melissa McCarthy gets stuck with all these really stupid old lady disguises, with cats and she doesn't even own a cat. But Jude law and even her dump partner get awesome undercover disguises. Melissa Mcarthy is mostly behind the desk, but when the man she's in love with gets killed, or she thinks he gets killed. She decides to become a field agent. She has some experience and knows what to do and is smart. But Jude law has kept her behind a desk so long. She doesn't think she can be as good as him, but she goes just to get vengeance for him. Through the movie, with luck and using her brain, she actually becomes a really great spy. With Jason Statham not following the rules, he goes to find find Rose Byrne as well. But she knows all their field agents. So through this whole undercover process, he's just so funny and hilarious and one thing after another. You can't get bored and you laugh the entire time! I can't see how anyone can hate this movie, unless they have no sense of humor. I love the whole movie, the concept and the actual writing is so funny. I would have watched spy 2 if they made it. But I doubt they will ever make it. I'm so sick of stupid humor, with farting and burping and smoking pot. The only other funny movie is bridesmaids and makes me think of that movie when I watch this. I like all the characters and how well they all bounce off each other. It's really good writing and good movie! I even watched the unedited version because we are so obsessed with this movie in my house! Get a sense a humor and watch this. It's a must!!!!"
" Awkward...
",2020-07-05 00:00:00,7,"Even though I watched it 4 years ago when it premiered, when I rewatched it, it felt as awkward as the first time. Yikes!!!... Though a great movie a little exaggerate on that part!."
" Amazingly simple and funny, all the way
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,10,"Is there anything that this lady can not do. Give her a serious role and she will do well. Give her a comedic script, she will hit the ball out of park everytime. Add to that Jason Statham's hilarious over the top description of about how he has survived,and the banter between her and Jason, you get an awesome movie. Everytime you feel a little down, please go ahead and watch this movie. It's so good"
" Extremely Funny Movie
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,9,"Spy is a great movie. The script has some fun twists, and Jason gives a truly standout comedic performance. Melissa is on her game as always. I think many of the 1-Star reviews are from people that just don't like her.
When the movie ended, all I could think was it was the start of a new franchise. I was surprised there wasn't a sequel.
IMO this ranks with the rebooted 21 Jump Street for a fun, laugh out loud, comedy thriller."
" Funny, Fun, and GREAT cast!
",2020-06-11 00:00:00,9,"I keep checking Melissa's IMDB page to see if she's going to make a sequel, because there NEEDS to be a sequel (or 2 or 3 or 4). The banter between Melissa and both Statham and Byrne was hilarious, and both were perfect for their roles. The story was super clever, with the added bonus that it didn't try to explain every single detail (I hate when movies do that!). They've left it in a place where it doesn't HAVE to have a sequel, but could easily slide into another episode. I like a lot of Melissa's work (not all, I'd like to unsee Happytime Murders if I could), and this one is definitely in my top 3 faves of hers!"
" Some laughs, but mostly dissapointing
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,6,"What could have been an outrageous and fun female-led comedy, feels the like sad overused tropes that the film tries to make fun of. Director Paul Feig seems to have some consistency in directing films with somewhat forced comedy, as I also felt with his other hit film Bridesmaids. That isn't to say all his films are bad however, as I did enjoy The Heat and even didn't mind the Ghostbusters remake he was a part of, but there is just something off about Spy and Bridesmaids that just feels like such a missed and misunderstood opportunity. The film is layered with jokes, and can earn itself a few chuckles throughout, mainly towards its center, but sadly it isn't enough to carry the film as its own. The humor seems incredibly forced at times, which can make the film honestly a bit painful to watch, which is so sad considering so much talent is involved with the film. All the actors do try their best to bring their often over-the-top and eccentric characters to life, but some succeed more than others. The standouts in the film would not be any of the main cast members to me, but more the supporting actors, with Jude Law stealing every scene he has on screen, as well as Miranda Hart and Peter Serafinowicz in their wacky roles. The film is moderately entertaining, but seems to get a bit tedious with twist after twist and fight scene after fight scene towards its conclusion. The film seems to try too hard to try to make its audience laugh, and to try to provide the audience with something more different than other spy films, that it takes a cliche of its own on in sports, by providing the viewer with an utterly complicated spy thriller while also trying to balance out the large humor aspect going for it- with minimal success. The film can be beautifully shot at times, with some cool cinematography for both action scenes and just scenes in general. In the end however, Spy hardly seems to prove to be a worthwhile comedy. It meets the minimum standard for comedy goers, but never proves itself to be anything but ordinary, despite trying to break out of the desperate mold it has trapped itself in.
My Rating: 6.25/10"
" Melissa McCarthy is No 007, She's More Entertaining
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,10,"This is a crazy, hilarious and smart comedy. What makes this caper work so well is that you are in on the joke. Spy makes great fun of everything about espionage and McCarthy is a great foil. She's a dedicated employee who works behind the scenes as the eyes of one of the top spies in the field played by Jude Law who she's crazy mad in love with. Her banter with him is hilarious whether she's having a dinner with him or telling him to duck from impending peril. Jude's cover gets blown and McCarthy ends up going to Europe for field work. Instead, she takes her assignment to another level. The movie gets even funnier as Europe is lampooned. Miranda Hart also shines brightly. This movie makes me laugh out loud even when I view it by myself."
" Better than most comedies
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,7,"POSITIVES:1) The film blends the action and comedy genres together very well
2) I loved the James Bond style opening sequence and song
3) There are definitely some very funny moments
4) Jason Statham steals the show, he's completely hilariousNEGATIVES:1) Not all of the humour works
2) I found the Miranda Hart character extremely annoying
3) There are a couple of blatant continuity errors"
" Melissa McCarthy Is A Bad Ass!
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,8,"I'm really into this film and when I get the urge to watch a great action film, I'd definitely watch this one. It's so full of perfect moments of humour and McCarthy, who plays CSI Agent Susan Cooper, is a bad ass! Also, Bobby Carnavale and Rose Byrne are the perfect villains and are married in real life, but play opposing baddies. The fight scenes, the car chases, the kitchen scene with McCarthy and the fight scenes at the end are some of the best. Jude Law and Jason Statham are really good supporting actors. If someone were to ask me who I thought was the best villain in this movie, I'd say it was Carnavale's Sergio DeLuca. He has some of the best dialog."
" I don't know why anyone wouldn't rate it 10... face/off references
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,10,"It's funny and if you don't like it stop reading. It's not on any streaming services, I bought a blu ray in quarantine to watch this when I was sober. Plus face/off machine references..."
" nice action comedy
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,5,"The story is like a parody of a female James Bond.
The plot was quite funny, I smiled but never really laughed.
That's why it was OK overall."
" Very entertaining
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,8,1/10? Come on that's ridiculous. No it's not a masterpiece but it's fun! Some twists in the plot and had a great time watching it! To some reviewers - > WHY SO SERIOUS?
" DELIGHTFUL
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,10,"This movie is perfection. Every cast member, from the leads to the cameos, is hilarious. I expected as much from McCarthy and Janney, but who knew Statham had perfect comedic timing?! The action is exciting, the jokes land, and it's just altogether fun.
A lot of reviews here of this movie seem to be confused- of course it's got sex and violence. It's a Bond tribute! That's kind of inherent to the genre. If you're bothered by those things, don't watch it. Also it's R rated! It's not the movie's fault if you're too stupid to realize that means not to bring your kids.
And that's setting aside all the reviews that are angry because of ""fat"" ""horse-faced"" ""broads"". I really wish there was some way to correct for the pathetic man-babies rejecting it on those reasons- how is that POSSIBLY a fair rating?!
And NO, I did not rate it a 10 to counter that. I rated it 10 because the only improvement I can think of is to give it a sequel!!!"
" Kinda funny, but why the graphic violence?
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,2,"This movie is funny in some places and lame in others. I'd probably give it 5 or 6 out of ten stars, but deduct four because the violence is needlessly graphic, and completely out of place in a comedy."
" Bad words about Republic of Bulgaria.
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,1,"Totally lost me with the story for Bulgaria. I think they don't have a real idea about this country and made themselves look stupid by adding Budapest after that. Check the map next time and be careful what you say about countries you know nothing about. I find this offensive and hate should never be spread through movies, doesn't matter the country. You can't say ""growing in Bulgaria is the worst"", the whole description of Bulgaria is ridiculous. They clearly have no idea of what life in Europe is, too. Educate yourselves, because you seriously embarrassed yourselves!The creators of this movie should consider a Formal Apology to this country.Bullying is not something normal or acceptable in Europe. Hope you get that right."
" Love
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,10,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!
I can quote this all day long."
" Far funnier than most of the mean reviewers would have you believe
",2020-02-15 00:00:00,7,"I must admit that I watched this film after recording it off the TV. I'd never heard of it and didn't even realise it was a British film. I nearly gave up after the first few minutes but then it suddenly showed promise and I stuck with it. I'm glad that I did because it turned out to be very enjoyable in a silly kind of way. I'd never heard of the lead actress, so assumed that it was originally written with Dawn French in mind, who must have backed out at the last minute. After reading some of the reviews I'm getting the feeling that this appeals far more to the British sense of humour than to Americans, most of whom probably don't get it at all. It's very Comic Strip in places, although obviously with a bit more gore. It's daft, but enjoyably so."
" A very welcome contribution to the spy spoof genre!
",2020-02-08 00:00:00,7,The best film Melissa McCarthy and Paul Feig have done together since Bridesmaids; laughed out loud in a few places and it is clearly made with a passion for the spy genre! Particular highlights for me were a couple of scenes with Jason Statham on great comic form and Peter Serafinowitz turning up as a real-life version of Pepe le Pew! McCarthy is a brilliant dramatic actor as well as comic and has great on-screen chemistry with everybody (including Miranda Hart who is a pleasure to watch in her first major big screen role)
" Adequate
",2020-02-01 00:00:00,4,"Well, if you've nothing better to do... This is the kind of ""comedy"" that maybe works better if you're American? I just thought it was really unfunny and full of unpleasant stereotypes but I kept watching because it has such good reviews on IMDB. I must be missing something or just have a sense of humour that is too european."
" Surprisingly funny
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,7,I find Melissa McCarthy extremely annoying but this movie was surprisingly funny.
" Oscar material?
",2020-01-22 00:00:00,8,"No, but I thoroughly enjoyed a light-hearted action comedy about the spy world. Solid cast throughout although Jason Statham's foul-mouthed klutz character got a bit wearing.
A pleasant stress-free way to spend about an hour-forty"
" Very underrated spy spoof
",2019-12-01 00:00:00,9,"Having read a number of 1 star reviews I'm amazed at how many people just didn't get this gem of a film. Either that or they've had a sense of humour bypass. I saw Spy in the cinema when it first came out and I haven't laughed so hard at a film in years. I have since seen it three or four times and still find it hilarious.Some seem to have missed that it's a spoof, it's not trying to be Bond, Bourne or even Kingsman, it's taking the familiar tropes and turning them upside down to comedic effect. The cast are all excellent, with particular praise for Jason Statham and Peter Serafinowicz as a hard man spy who's really an idiot, and an Italian lothario agent, respectively. Statham's willingness to send himself up mercilessly is just brilliant. This is first and foremost a very funny comedy, but it also works as an action movie. The action sequences and stunts are well done and exciting and would not be out of place in a straight spy film.Basically, don't believe the 1 star reviews. It's not Shakespeare, it's not trying to be, but it is a consistently funny spoof and well worth a view if you're looking for a bit of escapism."
" Feminism vomit fest
",2019-11-23 00:00:00,1,"Despite one or two cool frames of fight scenes and brain on surge, the constant pouring, pushing and ladling of feminist agenda and constant, repetitive ding of 'all men are pigs' dictum it was cringy, trite, cliche and a vomit fest akin to the scene where the character herself throws up on someone.The fact is had they solely stuck to parody it could have been great. But this liberal dosage of heavy dollops of agenda makes me just wanna scream like Munch to see the gradual deterioration and erosion of values of the gall movie makers had."
" Very good
",2019-11-20 00:00:00,10,"I liked the movie as an amazing story, performance, photography, directing and even music and songs were very beautiful. Thank you Paul Fig. Thank you."
" Melissa Mccarthy at her finest
",2019-11-20 00:00:00,8,Spy had me laughing so hard! Melissa Mccarthy's movies seem to be a little touch and go but this one was totally on point! Mccarthy + Feig = gold.
" Awesome movie if you are tired and want crazy-humor!
",2019-11-07 00:00:00,10,"This is the perfect movie if you want to have fun in front of the TV and you like to have fun and enjoy jokes that are simply stupid! It might not sound like a good commercial, but it is... just like Dumb and Dumber and Mr. Bean is packed with stupid jokes, so is Spy from 2015. But, I like that kind of humor, and as a result, this movie is 100% enjoyable and a movie I am able to watch over and over again.Jason Statham is incredible in his role as a stupid agent that does everything wrong, and Melissa McCarthy is perfect for the role as an undercover agent who really is an analyst with little experience in the field!All in all, this is a movie that will make you laugh hard, especially if you like such sort of humor and if you are a bit tired!"
" The only good thing here is Jason Statham
",2019-10-25 00:00:00,2,"After watching this I decided I definitely don't like Melissa Mccarthy's acting and most, if not all, of the movies she makes, although they usually look funny from the trailers. From the trailer this movie looked promising, light-hearted and funny/entertaining. Well, I didn't laugh at all, except on the - unfortunately few - scenes, where the likeable, very funny Statham is in. I actually found myself thinking several times ""Is this supposed to be funny? Should I turn it off?"". Eventually I survived through the whole film.
Bland, not funny story and not entertaining. It's a pity!"
" Melissa rocked
",2019-10-13 00:00:00,10,Melissa McCarthy rocked in this movie....action packed and funny!
" Highly overrated
",2019-10-11 00:00:00,2,"So this gets 7/10 with more than 200k votes.. this movie is not funny and pathetic. I was so bored that I got some work done watching the first half before I couldn't take it anymore and I had to stop it. I give 2 stars for the nice travel destinations but take this out what's left? Stupid jokes, non sense action.. don't trust the rating and help yourself watching another movie."
" Less serious spy film.
",2019-10-09 00:00:00,5,"Spy is a flim produced in 2015. Normally, I don't really watch old films. But I watched it anyway. The reason why I watched this film was because of Jude Law. Recently, I watched Contagion which was also Jude Law was in. And then I found out this film. Plus, I saw this one on a website and I felt like it's going to be a good film, so, I chose to watch it.The film is basically fine. And it's funny. But some of the words and actions are unbearable. So, I closed my eyes when those scenes came. I even felt like ashamed. And also there are a lot of f words which make me uncomfortable to listen to. Moreover, I feel like it's kind of copied from James Bond's films. Maybe it's because of the theme song part. That scene reminded me of James Bond films.That being said, this film makes a good one because it's all about actions and CIA things. Maybe that was also the reason why I watched this one. The actions are cool and some scenes are amazing. I kind of loved it.To say it in overall, this film is a little bit less serious. But it's so much fun. Hence, it's not that much a great film but enjoyable and watchable. I kind of enjoyed it because it's full of funny things. But for some reasons that made me not to like this film that much, I only gave this one 5 stars."
" Melissa McCarthy
",2019-10-03 00:00:00,1,"She is so disgusting ,un talented and histrionics. So i wont watch any movie of her."
" first half bad, second half good.
",2019-09-21 00:00:00,6,The first half of the film is MM playing a mousey field agent who goes under cover as a loser fish out of water kansas in europe character and the jokes are tired and flat. Thankfully her character switches gears to a foulmouthed wolverine type in the second half more semilar to her happytime murders character. MM always seems to shine brightest when shes allowed to play the role of just being tired of everyones bs. If you can make it through the first hour without shutting it off you get pretty well rewarded for the rest of it.
" Nice movie but 18+++++

" How many people get why this is such a good film?
",2019-08-25 00:00:00,10,"It seems as though lots of negative reviewers on here don't get why this is such a funny and brilliant film. The director is WAY more intelligent than to just want to make a James Bond spoof. This is a breath of fresh air for people who are sick of films that serve male tastes and interests. The feminist jokes go further than the absolutely brilliant lead played by Melissa McCarthy with concomitant jokes about her being a very unlikely cool and genius successful spy for British Intelligence. There's the whole angle of her male companion who is at a loose end and trying to get in on her mission, who can't help boasting about what he's achieved in the past. Jumping from high buildings using his jacket as a parachute for example -and then she later shows him up and completely dumbfounds him with a line about how he might have two as his gun's protruding from his back pocket. His face, as he's dumbstruck by this idea, is priceless. Frankly, I'm dumbstruck by the brilliance of everyone who made this film. The Timing is everything in Comedy, right? Well, by some sleight of hand they've managed to make an absolute symphony of action and jokes. I don't know how they did it and I'm so impressed that I reckon I'll remember this film forever. It's one of my greats! Absolute appreciation to everyone who made it! Thanks!"
" The stars deliver!
",2019-08-03 00:00:00,9,I loved this movie! The comedy is sharp and all the pretty faces deliver the goods in this one. I hope they make a sequel.
" 75 for this Metacritic? Really? Seriously?
",2019-07-28 00:00:00,3,"Not very funny, very common 'jokes' for kids, some ok parody, not a good movie..."
" Still hilarious after repeated viewings!!
",2019-07-21 00:00:00,8,"In what is quite possibly Melissa McCarthy's funniest film to date, Spy pokes an obvious finger at the James Bond empire offering up a great mix of hilarious gags, likeable characters and well executed action scenes.And it is with the latter that I enjoyed the film even more, as McCarthy takes what screen time she can in getting her hands dirty and doing a lot of the action herself!For me, its rare today for a modern comedy to have me laughing continuously the whole way through, but Spy does this over and over again.Yes its camp, its rude, its silly and features a cameo by my favourite Eurovision winner, but it works. Action hard nut Statham takes the piss out of himself with glee, as the rest of the cast enjoy playing larger than life characters that bounce off each other well.Spy - whether viewed in its theatrical or extended version - just never lets up, with memorable moments and quotes coming at you every few seconds!If you don't find this funny, maybe you need to have your chuckle muscle checked..."
" my notes
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,7,"I was shocked that I liked this. I've never liked Melissa McCarthy and I'd said multiple times ""you couldn't pay me to watch that."" the comedy wasn't always consistent, but I was dying laughing at a bunch of stuff. multiple hilarious characters and completely unexpected jokes.it also had some horrible characters (cia boss) and some of the jokes fell flat. some of the story was expected, altho a lot wasn't. And I was a little confused if it was trying to be realistic or just stupid-funny at times. regardless, I was very entertained by the comedy and some surprisingly good action. it was a very well made movie with the way it was executed, production value, music, etcThe second time i watched this, i saw the extended version which is 11 minutes longer. it seemed to drag and there were some really unfunny parts that i'm guessing were the extended scenes. i wanted to drop it to a 3.0 but i left it at 3.5 (2 viewings)"
" The only review that matters
",2019-06-17 00:00:00,7,"First of all, when people watch the movie and leave nasty degrading reviews only means its personal. It's amazing how angry people leaving reviews here are... I kinda feel sorry fir them because r I see their blood pressure rising.Having said that... I gave 7 to this movie because Melissa's mouth. I hope she can just fix that one thing because she takes it to all her movies and make her seem like she needs to be vulgar to survive. I just wish she can tone it down a bit.Okay the story was not believable. When the movie started Bradley Fine was good. He killed all bad guys swiftly but towards the end he couldnt but watched as Susan unleashed her superspy skills. I feel it was gonna be better if they fought alongside each other.It was also not believable that Rayna fell so quickly for Bradley Fine that she trusted him in 2 minutes to include him in her nuke deal. You must remember that in the private jet Rayna told Susan that she does not trust any body soooo yea.When Rayna's drink was spiked, Susan only said to her that ""someone"" put a roofie in her drink but Rayna responded by saying that ""could you point the man out?""I also think that a scene where Rayna and Bradley were kissing... When Susan said shes a loud kisser, she should've continued by saying that she SOUNDS like an old toothless woman sucking the jelly out of a doughnut and not she LOOKS... if you catch my drift. But as I always say, I blame the whole behind the scenes crew. The acting was great... I was mostly impressed by Jason. I did not picture him in comedy at all but he nailed it. He musnt do it often because being serious works a great deal for him. It was nice to see him laid back and laughing. The Rock however just blends in everything.Theres another one thing I dont like about Melissa's movies (I realized this on Heat) where most men hits on her a lot. That should also be toned down. It puts a negative spin on her roles. It's unnecessary attention.Spy is a nice movie so thumbs up for me."
" ""I look like someone's homophobic aunt!""
",2019-06-09 00:00:00,6,"Mediocre spy action comedy. It's not crap but, from such names, I expected a lot more.6/10"
" Bring on a sequel as long as we get more bumbling Statham!
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,8,"SpyA pleasant surprise was sitting down to this movie.
The premise is a tried and tested one. We've all seen the spy comedy before.
So what sets this one apart from the rest?
Well because this one is actually quite funny!
Sure this is mainly down to the seasoned comedy skills of lead Melissa McCarthy and Miranda Hart but suprisngly it is action star Jason Statham that steals the show.
Statham only crops up every now and again but when he does he owns every scene he's in.The plot like aforementioned is one that's been done before.
Expert Spies have to rely on underdog to save the day as their identities have been breached and there's the generic big bomb that needs to be retrieved so it's up to unknown and untested CIA analyst (McCarthy) to go undercover.Paul Feig's film manages to sustain the laughs and this is partially due to his excellent cast all getting fully onboard with the hilarity and having a good time making this crowd pleasing comedy.
The hero is only as good as their villain and Rose Byrne is both beautiful and hilarious to behold.
Her rapport with McCarthy helps drive the movie but when the film does begin to stall, up pops Statham sending the film back into overdrive.
There's good support from Jude Law who would have probably made a very good James Bond.
Perhaps he could fill Daniel Craig's shoes when he's done with the role?Action and wit is a plenty here and the cameo from the normally wooden 50 cent is another highlight to this bright and bushy comedy romp.
I wasn't a fan of Paul Feig's Ghostbusters reboot which also starred Melissa McCarthy but I'd definitely pay to see Spy 2!"
" Something beginning with M
",2019-03-13 00:00:00,4,"Is it man-hating? Is it misandry?Paul Feig is not a director I admire. I was mostly amused watching Bridesmaids (I was the only one laughing in the cinema during the screening) and The Heat bored me to sleep. I skipped Ghostbusters 2016 after his distaste for fans of that series became apparent. But upon watching Spy I have come to the conclusion that this man might actually be disturbed. The rampant man-hating here is both morbid and clinically fascinating.The story is a rehashed version of the superior 1985 Chevy Chase/Dan Aykroyd comedy Spies Like Us with mild aspirations of being a James Bond/Jason Bourne parody. Melissa McCarthy is the underdog desk jockey given a chance at working in the field and she does her best with the messy script. I like McCarthy, she gets a lot of hate even though she's a talented comedic and dramatic actress, but she needs to start distancing herself from Paul Feig.Coherence and pace are thrown out the window in favour of endless, tiresome gags at the expense of men and male dignity. Sorry Feig, we don't owe you our dignity. Men built the world and its not for you to portray each and every one of us as a sexual predator, moron, or an expendable piece of meat. Of the many, many, many dead bodies in this film only two are female and the rest are white men. Feig obviously enjoys killing men but he's not got the moxie to make any of them a shade darker.I'm so sick and tired of these ""comedies"" from the last 15 or so years directed by Feig and his peers (especially Judd Apatow) that last in excess of 2 hours. I find these bloated running times to be arrogant, condescending, self-important, and unfocused. Spy should have been a 95-minute movie. It's more than half an hour longer than that. Feig had way too much power here and an editor not afraid to chop it down could have saved it. I defy you to properly follow the plot and fully understand what is happening and why. There is a very funny (however smug) movie somewhere in here, but it's lost in Feig's man-hating indulgence and his over-confidence of his own screenplay.The ""hilarious"" dialogue follows the same, single flow for the entire duration.Character 1: Effing, effing, eff, eff yourself, eff, eff, eff, (something wacky and weird), mother eff (weirdness), effer, the eff, (quirkiness), eff yourself, effing, eff.
Character 2: Wow, that's not normal.Even if the above problems were not enough, how many times must we have a British TV star pop up in an American movie as an exaggerated stereotype designed to make the Yank look cool? Wonder Woman, The Mummy, every character played by Hugh Grant or Stephen Merchant, C3PO, etc, etc. Enough is enough. Miranda Hart plays the one role she is seemingly capable of playing, wilfully typecasting herself for the disgrace of being in a big budget Hollywood movie.The action is of the stutter-cut and speed-ramping variety. The cinematography is wide and flat with unnaturally boosted colors, and the camera blocking is very televisual. There are sitcoms with more grace and fluidity. I've had it with Feig. Blake Edwards he ain't. I will never watch another one of his movies and I'm hoping that his loud misandry and the bomb of Ghostbusters 2016 has crippled his ability to make such rotten garbage."
" It's disgusting
",2019-03-06 00:00:00,1,"Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time on this, you want a comedy watch your favorite again."
" Five Stars For the Stars
",2019-03-06 00:00:00,5,"*May contain spoilers* The cast was pretty good but the script sub-par. When I got the DVD and watched it a few times along with some of the outtakes I realized the main problem with a fairly decent film was the doggone editing. They left out some really funny lines that would have made the actual film much better. The back and forth of some really lame conversation that was supposed to be over the top was TOO over the top to be enjoyed by me. Again the editing of how long the camera lingered on things for the full comedy impact was not done well. It flashed around on things and made changes from one day to another so quickly without context sometimes, it was disturbing. Cute in parts but basically kind of disappointing. I used to be a huge McCarthy fan but not so much anymore. Her characters are getting too gross for my liking."
" Appallingly unfunny
",2019-02-25 00:00:00,3,"SPY is another appalling outing from Melissa McCarthy and Paul Feig; the actor and director also made GHOSTBUSTERS, which I had the misfortune to watch and quickly forget about afterwards. This one's a broad (what else?) spy spoof in which McCarthy's character goes from office worker to super-spy in the space of an hour. It's another mix of mindless cliche and supposedly sharp dialogue between the principal characters, dialogue which just offers crudity without wit. McCarthy's foul-mouthed lead is consistently unfunny and randomly goes from bumbling buffoon in the first hour to genuine super-spy at the climax (with the copious aid of a stunt double, of course). Miranda Hart is embarrassingly bad as the sidekick, while other actors are wasted. I only watched this for Jason Statham, who's amusing enough riffing on his action man persona, but he's not enough."
" Bond, Bourne, Hunt and Bauer, time to back off and watch out.
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,7,"Much has been said about McCarthy, an amiable plus-size lady, as a viable movie star but there is no longer any question. Brash, bold and believable at every turn, Spy is a showcase and a celebration of her as a performer."
" Great comedy. Don't listen to the haters.
",2019-02-16 00:00:00,8,"Ridiculous that some give this 1/10. I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion. It is a very funny movie. Very entertaining and well made. Probably Melissa McCarthy's best comedy. Plenty of laughs. Comedies are meant to be funny, and this film certainly is. Not sure why others would rate it so poorly, but really doesn't make any difference; pity for them. Have seen this several times now. In fact watching it right now with my wife, stumbled upon it again while flicking through the channels on TV, and it still makes us laugh a lot. Don't listen to the haters. Great movie. Hope they make a sequel."
" A nice suprise
",2019-02-03 00:00:00,7,This movie has a simalar plot to ones before it but that dosent matter as there are some really funny moments there
" What is the problem with all these 1 star reviews?
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,9,"You look at the reviews and they all give only 1 star. What the heck. In a movie that clearly never takes itself seriously, why are people taking it so seriously? I honestly loved this movie, and no, I'm not a teenager. It's a spy satire with great action scenes and a good rhythm. There were so many memorable moments in this movie for me, like Susan Cooper killing the guy unintentionally, Ford showing up in Cooper's hotel and bragging about all absurd things he's ever done, every scene that Ford appears, the airplane scene. And the Cooper's fight with the woman in the kitchen was totally badass."
" An Interesting Uneven, Ragged Comedy Spy Thriller
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,7,"7 June 2015. Either Melissa McCarthy or the director/scriptwriter Paul Feig attempted to create a new spy comedy genre using an hefty female character who also happens to be a good stand up comic and using plenty of R-Rated live stand comedy acts along with the drunken beer crowd. The results of this attempt comes down to a pretty subjective preference for this form of comedy which not everyone I assume really gets off on. There have been much more smoother and witty comedic spy movies such as the ironic dual identity comedy True Lies (1994), the comedy duo of Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2007), the traditionally awkward male spy of Gun Shy (2000), the much witty straight guy version Wild Target (2010). Even Sandra Bullock's performance in Miss Congeniality (2000) might be a good comedic comparison to contrast Spy with. In some ways, the script tries too hard to be Peter Sellers funny but in the more crude, sexed up contemporary way.What would have been even more fascinating and a great career move would have been to have Melissa try a serious Bruce Willis performance as in The Whole Nine Yards (2000) with Jude Law playing the bumbling super spy. In some ways, this movie uses James Bond music melodic chords with a parody of large figured woman which only degrades and perpetuates the derogatory image of them instead of bringing a more authentic respect to them. Or if such a comedic performance was insisted about, emulation of Pierce Brosnan's character in The Matador (2005) might have offered a more serious challenge to the comedic spy genre or the female characters in Daisy & Violet (2011) or John Cusack in Grosse Point Blank (1997). The perhaps the best contemporary female comedy spy movie would be Katie Holme's character in Miss Meadows (2014)."
" Hillarious funny, but not a family comedy
",2018-12-13 00:00:00,9,"This and the Kingsman are the two funniest spy movies I have seen the last decade. However, where the The Kingsman is an elegant over the top violent movie, the «Spy» is an elegant action spy movie with funny surprises where things goes wrong and the humor can be vulgar from time to time (plump), but done perfectly. Definetly NOT a family comedy to watch with the kids, but a GREAT laugh for grown ups. I have not laughed as much in years, and I am a person that not usually laughs of vulgarities. Jason Statham is fantastic in his role, making fun of his own film character he has build over the years. You will LOVE the film if you allow the crazyness to entertain you, and hate it if you can't accept profanities/sex jokes and expect a political correct movie."
" I WISH I HAD MORE BULLETS
",2018-11-26 00:00:00,8,"Based upon the success of ""The Heat"" a film role was written for Melissa McCarthy. I think everyone knows the plot where a desk jockey agent goes into the field with expected results. Jason Statham, while having a minor role, provided laughs with his serious description of impossible spy antics.Many scenes were spy film spoofs. The film teetered on cheese, not knowing whether it should venture there or not. The main problem I had with this film, is that I kept mentally comparing it to ""The Heat"" and frankly, ""The Heat"" was funnier. The film is worth seeing, but there is nothing spectacular about the cinematography that demands it be seen on the large scene.Guide: Excessive F-bombs. No sex. Brief male nudity."
" A joke that goes on too long
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,5,"Spy is a funny movie, but it feels like a joke that goes on too long. The humor is almost entirely dependent on the improvised dialogue between actors and Melissa McCarthy playing the same type of character we've come to expect. However, it's fun to watch a different take on the spy genre and this movie also features some impressive action scenes. Plus, Rose Byrne is in it, and that never hurts a movie."
" Stathan is wonderfull

" An unexpected gem of a movie
",2018-09-06 00:00:00,9,"To be honest I didn't expect much from this movie. The poster really put me off it but the trailer hooked me in enough for me to give it a go.
I was pleasantly surprised on several fronts. From a comedic standpoint this movie had plenty of laugh out loud moments. From unexpected jokes to cliched jokes done well enough that they were still funny. To some degree I felt the movie was laughing at itself and pulled this off. Less astute viewers might miss this and feel that the movie is using them for the sake of trying to be clever but in my opinion that was an element of its brilliance.
From an acting point of view I felt that Melissa McCarthy and Miranda Hart delivered the best performances of any movie that I have seen them in and felt they worked well together. Also notable was Jessica Chaffin and Jason Statham.
As for the script I felt it moved the story along nicely. A great balance of comedy, action and drama well paced through out the movie. 
This movie was beautiful to watch in HD with some lovely locations and sets which added to my overall enjoyment. This is a movie I will enjoy watching again one day and would risk watching a sequel should they ever make one."

Only recently did I see all the negative user reviews, and am feeling a need to come to its defense. Most seem off-put by any vulgarity, and don't seem to know it's a parody when they complain about the plot. I'm pretty sure this crowd still considers Oscar Wilde a gold standard of humor, worthy of their ""intellect"". The seemingly crude jokes in this movie were beside the point. What is most hilarious about this movie are the characters, major and minor. And the crowned jewels of this movie were its stars, Melissa McCarthy and Rose Byrne. Just about every exchange between them is golden."

There are many rich people just like anywhere else and believe me WOMEN are VERY beautiful. So this ugly words used in this movie and the horrible image that was created about Bulgaria is so untrue and mean! Such a disappointment! Lost at least 8 million people of the audience with this script ....Also +33 is the phone code of France not only of Paris.

" A comedy with not many jokes but a lot of profanity
",2018-07-23 00:00:00,2,"The problem with this film is that both the star and director made it under the misapprehension that swearing a lot is funny by itself so have therefore seemingly dispensed with putting any effort in when it comes to actually constructing comedic scenes and delivering punchlines. Relying on famous faces saying ""fuck"" every five seconds loses any impact quite quickly and stops being funny soon after. That said, Jason Statham sends his hard man persona up quite nicely and the film picks up whenever his on screen but its little and far between.The film is also extremely violent for a comedy - with several minor characters suffering quite horrendous wounds and deaths in the ""name of fun"". Having a character suffer multiple gun shot wounds, stabbing a woman in the hand and having a man have his throat melt after drinking acid may be funny to director Paul Feig but he doesn't have the skill nor the competence to handle ""Tom & Jerry"" violence and misjudges the tone of the film completely. Is someone throwing up on a dead man really the height of comedy?Finally, their is an underlying tone of racism (offensive Italian stereotypes, racist language etc) throughout that arguably leaves a worst taste in the mouth than the aforementioned acid."
" Very funny!
",2018-07-20 00:00:00,9,"The movie was in great quality and was funny! Great cast! Watched it with the whole family, and everyone enjoyed it."
" Better than expected
",2018-06-10 00:00:00,7,This came out around the Melissa McCarthy rage and it honestly looked terrible so I never had any interest in seeing it. It's not a great movie but it did surprise me. The plot was decent enough with a couple plot twists but it was mainly about her free styling. Sometimes it was really funny and sometimes she just kept going too long which is basically what always happens with her. I enjoyed the first half of the movie a lot but then she became more confident in the movie and thus her insults became more ridiculous. I thought she was much more funny when she wasn't confident but either way it was a decent use of my time. Much better than I thought it would be.
" Surprisingly entertaining and even, in its own neutered and sort of cringe-inducing way, almost endearing.
",2018-05-03 00:00:00,6,"I'd be lying if I said I was ever expecting anything from this spy spoof - due to a combination of its marketing, the behind-the-lens talent and, even, an overall lack of enthusiasm of its pastiche prospects, since most in that particular sub-genre are indeed sub-par. I'd also be lying if I said I wasn't pleasantly surprised by 'Spy (2015)', though, because, while it's predictable and predictably clichéd in both its narrative and overall execution, the feature is actually rather entertaining and even sort of endearing in its own, albeit slightly neutered and kind of cringe-inducing, way. It's not particularly funny, though there are some jokes that land amidst the many that don't, and there's a narrative element that takes a certain character and their arc in an annoying direction, one that actually goes so far in that specific direction it almost runs counter to itself, but there's plenty to like here. Your mileage will vary, though, depending greatly on how empathetic you find the characters and how funny you find the humour. 6/10"
" As dump as it gets ... for the best
",2018-04-28 00:00:00,6,"Humor was predictable most of the times but timing and delivery was great. All characters over the top but damn, that cast. They nailed it!"
" Watched till I cried.
",2018-04-21 00:00:00,10,"I could t stop laughing. It's raunchy, sort of unpredictable in a predictable way, and has some of the best one-liners I've seen in decades. Watched like 6 times!"
" Genuine laugh a minute
",2018-04-02 00:00:00,8,Can't think of many films I've laughed at this much outside of The Hangover. Genuinely a laugh comes up to replace the one you just stopped having. Jason Statham and Peter Serafinowicz are hilarious stooges and all the James Bond / Jason Bourne sub-references make this an enjoyable parody.
" Avoid
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,1,"I avoided this bomb for 3 years, but with little other choice of things to watch, and my sister saying she had enjoyed it, I gave it a chance. Full of things even a child would not find funny (the likes of fart jokes and excessive profanity), but unfortunately completely void of humour. And they are considering a sequel?"
" Mostly Unfunny Though Well Filmed...
",2018-03-03 00:00:00,5,"So here we have another very unfunny comedy film. Why is it people think swearing out of context is funny. Swearing can be much more comedic when handled as part of a witty dialogue. Then, of course, there are the standard poo jokes. The even more used machismo parodies. Based on the over-utilised underdog that learns to bite back and roar like a lion storyline. With a twist that's so obvious, it's actually not a twist. This is just a mash-up of the usual elements, however, writer and director Paul Feig does give us something new with them, he actually makes them boring. Throughout the entire film, there were three places that made me smile and only one that made me laugh... and that was towards the end - a long time to wait.Though I will say this for Feig, he really can direct a film. The only thing which keeps this movie interesting is the direction. There are quite a few decent camera shots and angles, well lighted and composed. He's also pretty good at action. The fight scenes are spot on and the chase sequences are excitingly filmed. If it weren't for this and the cast the film would be a real dud.As for the acting, this was below par for most of the cast. And it was the lead role of Susan Cooper (McCarthy) which spoils the film, instead of strengthening it. This is mainly because McCarthy plays McCarthy: Most of the characters she's played to date can be easily interchanged between their films, as there are very few differences. It would be nice to see her stretch her acting wings in her next role. Maybe if she actually had a good script and an original character to work with...I watched this for Miranda; I wondered how good she would be in a movie. She wasn't too bad; it was her scene that made me laugh, but there wasn't much to stretch her skills here. And, for Jason Statham, as I've been a fan since I saw him in The One. He has grown as an actor throughout his career, though, this feels like a few steps backwards.If you're a McCarthy fan you should like this though it'll feel all too familiar, at times. As for everybody else, it's an okay way to waste some time if you've got nothing better to do."
" Great without the nude stuff
",2018-01-20 00:00:00,8,"OK i have no idea, but the version I saw had no nudity. Just saw it, have no clue why they thought it was worth putting in. Without bits of that camera scene it's much better. That just makes it seem like Adam Sandler was directing for 30 seconds"
" Familiar premise, fantastic execution
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,7,"This is hardly the first or last spy parody movie. Some nail it (Johnny English), and some miss badly (the Austin Powers sequels). This one was just plain perfect. There's nothing original, but every cast member - McCarthy especially - nails every part. Comedies like this work best with real characters and unreal plots. Paul Feig clearly gets that. I laughed. A lot."
" Fun fun fun!
",2017-11-18 00:00:00,10,"I'm not usually a humor movie kind of person, but this movie really drew me in. It had something special, a sexy charm, a wonderful cast, and lots of action, albeit preposterous. I really liked it and I plan to watch it again. My favorite character was Aldo, I have known guys like him and they are always interesting.I must add that I saw an edited version of this movie, so it probably didn't contain the raunchier scenes other reviewers described. I thought the movie was teetering on the edge of objectionable as it was, so the unedited version might have been too much for me. Definitely not a movie for under 21."
" Good fun!
",2017-11-12 00:00:00,6,"Was a decent parody of typical spy films and has a few laughs. Jason Statham was definitely my favourite part, often making fun of characters he has played before. This genuinely made me laugh quite a few times.Rose Byrne as one of the villains was great as well. Overall the acting was quite good from everyone, nobody ruined any parts of the film with their performances. Some of the cinematography was good, nothing phenomenal though. However, some jokes did fall flat or were just over used. The film does try to parody spy films but ends up sticking to common tropes instead of commenting on them. I would think adding more commentary on these tropes would add to the comedic tone and maybe give more heart to it. But not every film needs to do this, definitely give it a chance, you may be surprised!"
" Hilarious movie with some plotting issues
",2017-11-07 00:00:00,8,"The often brilliant Melissa McCarthy is on top of her game as the mousy Susan Cooper, a behind-the-scenes CIA agent who finds herself struggling to prove herself in the field.The movie is rather similar to Bob Hope movies like My Favorite Brunette in which he found himself taking on a more exciting life he isn't completely prepared for. Like Hope, McCarthy will be incredibly incompetent when that can get the laughs but other times prove herself as able as more stereotypical heroes. (Although unlike most Hope movies, McCarthy plays someone who stars with some level of competence).The cast is excellent, with Jude Law doing a fine James Bond impression and very funny performances from Miranda Hart as a goofy fellow agent and Peter Serafinowicz as a sleazebag.There is also a bit of a feminist theme here, with the movie mocking masculine jerks (particularly Jason Statham's insane egotist). There is also some surprisingly solid action, most notably a Jackie-Chan- influenced kitchen fight.While the movie is funny and well-acted, the plot leaves something to be desired. It holds together most of the way, but towards the end the writers toss logic out the window and don't even really try to justify what's going on.Some people are complaining that this movie is foul-mouthed. I'm assuming these people live in small towns where Jimmy Stewart runs the local savings and loan and the Beaver is always getting into trouble. I found it all very funny."
" Best of Melissa McCarthy films
",2017-09-29 00:00:00,10,"Wasn't sure about this film at first as I am not a big of Melissa McCarthy but glad I watched it! Haven't laughed so much watching comedy compared to this one. Melissa is a good actor and rather funny too. Jason Statham, Jude Law and Rose Byrne being in it was also an added bonus! Don't understand why others were giving this film a 1 rating as it isn't bad at all. Give it a go of you have nothing else to watch."
" Dialog written by a 13 year old
",2017-09-04 00:00:00,3,"I'm giving it 3 stars for the opening sequence at which my husband said, ""Maybe we should by this DVD"" and the 3 or 4 truly funny moments. The rest of the film deserves a -5 stars for the potty humor constantly throughout the film along with not a single character having the ability to string together 3 words without inserting the f-bomb at least once. Some sentences are nothing but low language. This film had genuine potential. Melissa McCarthy really shone in the action sequences, a number of which I thought were truly funny, but then she spoke again. *sigh* And the penis, sex and fart ""jokes"" detracted even more. Remake this film as a true James Bond spoof with the witty dialog you see in those films and it could be a true winner. In other words, keep it in the vein of the opening sequence and I'd love it."
" Verey funny spoof
",2017-08-26 00:00:00,9,"I loved this film. I didn't have high hopes when I chose it on Netflix but laughed more than I have done for ages. It's not Citizen Kane, OK, but it has more laughs. It is sweary, and a bit crude but it all works. Statham is superb, sending himself up and I even liked Jude Law. Miranda Hart does her usual thing, but again it works. My partner told me to say how nice it was to see an older, none thin women, in a leading role!"
" Statham, the only reason
",2017-08-25 00:00:00,7,"Trailer looked exciting. I like Mccarthy but I like Statham more. He made the movie worth watching. There are instances where you can loose your instances but McCarthy and Statham's comedy chops will keep you going, just bear with some of the clichés. There are ups and downs. The ""twist"" I'm sure people saw it coming but was funny none the less"
" Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.
",2017-08-15 00:00:00,1,"First 5 minutes= quite promising next 20 minutes = extremely dire (profanity, crude images/bodily function jokes etc., etc.,) remaining 1 hour and 34 minutes = enjoyable as I switched it off.I've indicated ""spoiler"" as I can only assume that those who would rate this style of movie highly to warrant the current 7.1 out of 10 rating, would relish the content and find it really entertaining.In it's defence I suppose we do need movies like this if only to set the benchmark for low quality."
" A comedic American version of a James Bond movie.
",2017-08-07 00:00:00,8,"Spy is an action comedy starring the versatile and hilarious actress Melissa McCarthy. This movie is an American version of a James Bond movie, with added humor—but not in the manner of movies like Johnny English (2003) or Mordecai (2015). It's not a parody. The movie has a rather serious and complex plot complete with red herrings and twists. I wouldn't say it's completely realistic, but it's just enough to make it very funny without being too outlandish. It reminds me of one of my all time favorite action comedies ""True Lies"" (1994), where in both films unlikely people are thrust into CIA missions. Susan Cooper (McCartney) is a CIA agent who works as a guide for Bradley Fine (Jude Law). While Fine is doing field work, he is equipped with cameras. Cooper watches these cameras and alerts Fine of oncoming danger. During a mission to stop the transferring of a nuclear bomb, the cameras begin to malfunction, Cooper's images become unclear, and Fine is shot. The CIA chooses to put Cooper on the field to continue Fine's mission. Cooper has been at her desk her entire career, however Cooper is considered a CIA agent and therefore is considered qualified to take on the mission, although she is seemingly far from fit for the job in many ways. Being that Cooper has always worked at a desk, she is completely unknown to the enemies and can thus work well undercover. Having worked with Fine all these years, and having deeper feelings for Fine than even he knew, Cooper feels it is her duty to avenge Fine's death. She sets off to Europe jumping from one crazy circumstance to another. She quickly become more than meets the eye as her quick wit and even physical abilities are unleashed. This is a great comedy filled with witty banter, British satire, slapstick comedy and even some raunchy humor. Stay for the credits—even they're funny."
" Couldn't hold it together
",2017-08-04 00:00:00,6,"I know that the 'spy genre' is as old as the hills thanks to the everlasting Bond franchise, so much so that even spy movie parodies have become commonplace. Therefore, my hopes were only relatively high that Melissa McCarthy could pull one off with little more than having a female as the lead spy being the main noticeable difference. She plays a CIA agent who spends her career sitting behind a desk, providing intel for the 'real' spy, played by Jude Law. However, in a turn of events that is there to simply move the plot forwards, she ends up being sent out on a mission. And, for once, the 'hilarious consequences' promised in the trailer actually prove to look true.Once she's unleashed on the world (armed naturally with all the latest 'Q-style' gadgets every spy must have in their handbag) it's pretty funny. I was really enjoying the film, especially her interactions with Jason Statham. Now, whereas McCarthy is well used to comedy, Statham is hardly known for his sense of on-screen humour. However, he stole every scene for me and, even though he's in it a fair bit, he wasn't in it enough for my liking! However, as Statham's involvement was decreased, so did my enjoyment of the film.I've seen a fair few films which I would describe as 'films of two halves.' Normally, they're a bit slow to start, but, once they get going, really do pick up and entertain. Sadly, in my opinion, 'Spy' was the opposite. I was really enjoying McCarthy's trademark foul-mouthed banter and, despite the plot hardly being anything original (i.e. spy parody), I felt the jokes hit almost every time.However, the longer the film went on, the less jokes there seemed to be. Or, if there were jokes, they didn't seem half as funny as the first half's offerings. The film kind of moved away from comedy and went more for straight spy movie. By that I mean the plot took over which was just about as generic as they come. You have the baddie with the nuke and the doublecross and everything you'd see in either a Bond film, or any other spy parody.Overall, it's not bad, it's just one of those films that I feel would have worked better as a stand-alone TV show where the jokes could have remained tighter throughout the whole runtime instead of seemingly running out of steam midway through. Die-hard fans of McCarthy should probably enjoy this more than most and it was fun to see Jason Statham making fun of himself for a change, but apart from that, it's a film that I'd rather watch on TV than actually pay full price for."
" Light hearted action comedy
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed this for some stress-relief. Yes, it is very vulgar quite often. But I adore Miranda Hart, Jude Law is some suave damn eye-candy, Melissa is funny as always and it was nice seeing her take on an action role. Stratham must have needed something as light relief from his usual British crime seriousness; he does idiot well, it turns out. And Rose Byrne was an adorable, lethal, spoilt brat. Just some fun. Maybe I could have done without male porn bits. That 'thing', I don't know if it was real but it was repulsive. Eww."
" Hilarious McCarthy action comedy
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,9,"Melissa McCarthy and Paul Feig do it again! I swear when you get this director and this hilarious comedic actress together you just can't fail. The writing is really what makes this movie! When you compare the hilarious comedic script with such great actors that can deliver the lines well you just can't make a bad movie. Melissa is of course the perfect actress to play such a hilarious and many times endearing role, who can also be a pretty big badass when she needs to be. And one really important ingredient to this movies comedy is Miranda Hart, there wasn't a single scene where she was speaking that I wasn't doubled over laughing, she plays a very lovable best friend character to Melissa McCarthy. Jude Law and Jason Statham are also here playing side characters, and they're good in their roles, it's a very different role for Statham, he's never really done comedy, it's usually all hardcore action for him, but I thought he did pretty well even though he wasn't in his comfort zone. Rose Byrne is here, and I loved her comedic side shown in both neighbors and bridesmaid, she really is a very hilarious actress, and there's further proof of that statement here in Spy. The action is pretty good even though that's not what I watched it for. All in all, if you're expecting a well made hilarious Melissa McCarthy action comedy movie, then that's exactly what you're going to get. 9/10 for Spy."
" Not THE Worst
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,2,"This is not the worst movie ever made. ****Spoiler alert****Melissa McCarthy's ""The Boss"" is the worst movie ever made. **********************You have been warned.The Ghostbusters remake, also with Melissa McCarthy, is in the top ten worst movies. I don't dislike Melissa McCarthy. I thought she was great as Sean Spicer. But someone else obviously chose the material for that SNL sketch, not Melissa. She is fine when someone steps in, refuses to allow her to repetitively swear or do scatological or gross sexual jokes."
" PG 12 ?!!!! There are closeups of penises in this movie.
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,1,"How the *** can this be for 12 years and older?! There are closeups of penises in this movie. This should be in the adult section! That stupid penis-scene does not even add anything to the movie. The rest sure is PG12. I don't see why that pervert scene is in this otherwise enjoyable movie. We liked it, particular the slapstick, the unexpected crazy narratives and the over the top Bond-style. Altogether well worth seeing.I vote a 1 just because you can not allow children to look at mens erect private parts."
" Really funny
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,9,"After reading all those bad reviews , I decided to write my own review. The movie was excellent. It was really fun to watch, it made me laugh. It was the best spy comedy I have ever watched. The movie had a plot,it moved on fast, Melissa MC carthy was acting as she should. Nothing like her awful acting in the Heat. Jason Statham was really good at his role as a disastrous spy. I also liked the fact that the movie switched places fast, traveling through the beauty of European cities. it was very enjoyable. The reason I give 9/10 and not 10/10 , were 2 gruesome killings which could have been avoided. I mean ,they could have died without so much splatter. That would make the movie suitable for younger audience. But in general , the movie has an interesting plot, a great cast, a beautiful cinematography, I totally recommend it."
" Fieg and McCarthy hit comedy gold yet again
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,7,"Spy is a blandly forgettable name for a film, but in their third outing together director Paul Fieg and his muse Melissa McCarthy strike comedy gold yet again. McCarthy plays Susan Cooper, a CIA analyst who works behind a desk, partnering with a smooth talking debonair field agent who goes by the aptronym Bradley Fine (Jude Law, unexpectedly hilarious). Cooper nurtures a massive crush on Fine, who seems completely oblivious, to the point where, when he is murdered, she offers to go into the field herself to try and avenge his death. Of course all sorts of complications spring up, but despite having spent most of her years as a desk jockey, Cooper proves herself to be preternaturally adept at the spy game and her quick wits, confidence and brusque attitude always are on hand to help her save the day. The script is pretty solid, delivering up enough twists and turns to keep things interesting. But the real treat of the movie are in the performances. By now everyone knows that McCarthy is an Oscar nominated comedienne, but I could not have predicted such hilarious performances out of Jude Law or Jason Statham who absolutely kills it as one of the CIA's ultra serious field agents who is completely over the top but can't see the humour in his own ridiculousness. Also great: Allison Janney in a small role as the head of the CIA, British comedienne Miranda Hart as Susan's bestie and Rose Byrne as a bratty villain."
