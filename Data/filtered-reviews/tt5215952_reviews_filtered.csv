" I heard my soul leaving my body by boredom
",2021-04-11 00:00:00,1,"Small Review: NO! DON'T DO THIS TO YOURSELF. WE HAVE ONE LIFE.Longer review: Seriously the movie could do what I Just did... Skip most of it so we don't summon the evil spirit to find filmakers and make them pay for what they did to us.I strongly believe that whoever put a good grade to this film, was either paid by someone, or didn't actually see it and probably slept, saw a dream, like our protagonist does in many parts of the film and thought that their dream was the movie."
" Underwhelming, to be honest.
",2021-04-07 00:00:00,5,"My Rating : 5/10Take whatever meaning or so-called 'message' from 'The Wailing' - it leaves you with many to think about. For me, I can't seem to enjoy it as much - just felt a bit dull and boring - I wish the movie was more hypnotising and engaging after hearing so much about it everywhere online. It's okay - it's not a 'masterpiece' in my books - yes the last 20 or so minutes are really good to watch as a movie-goer but it doesn't really do much after that initial viewing.So for me it's 5/10 for 'The Wailing' certainly not an 8 which I was hoping it would be after the hype surrounding it and the glowing reviews it's been showered with."
" Waste of time
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,1,One of the worst movie which I've ever seen...please don't watch & waste your valuable 3 hrs in your life....😡
" A father's love for his daughter is something powerful, making us take many extra miles
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,9,"What worked:
So what makes this movie watchable repeatedly is the amazing screenplay and the narrative. It's not a jump scare horror but an unsettling story that keeps you hooked into the movie until finally the movie ends and you keep asking yourself what was all that you saw. It's one of those Korean movies with a very fine storytelling added with some fine performances by the lead. It's humorous at times, sentimental sometimes and thrilling on the rest of the movie. Also, the movie leaves you with some interpretations and relies on the rest on our interpretations but mainly it's a illustrative with some blanks in between. The fact that it can be watched multiple times is also because of the fine cinematography, editing and score. So overall the director deserves an appreciation for bringing together some of the fine members in the movie teamWhat did not work:
The run time is a bit longer making it a lengthy experience. Of course I think some of the scenes could have been cut down to shorten the movie for example the zombie scenes.
Final verdict: highly recommended"
" Decent film
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,8,"I liked this film, quite unique to an extent and has great cinematography/picture design. There is a lot of suspense and build up in this film but plot felt a bit random and sometimes off-topic. Not a fan of the two main police officers they were quite cringe to watch (screaming and rolling on the floor like kids lol) and didn't act like police officers. Ending was quite depressing"
" Excruciatingly long for what it is
",2021-03-17 00:00:00,3,"Why is this 2 and a half hours long? It's basically a generic supernatural Horror story with idiotic characters and no good surprises what so ever. Where are the scares? The Dog was like the scariest thing in the entire film. It's not funny (Why is the first hour a dumb Comedy and then suddenly serious?), the twists and turns come out of complete nowhere, nothing makes any sense, and the ending was like the most obvious crap I had ever seen.Why does it take so long to reach a similar conclusion I've seen countless other Horror films do it in like 90 minutes? What on Demon's Souls did this offer that was so unique to the rest? Why do they not get a free pass and this one does? Doesn't matter how well shot or acted it is, this was a major disappointment for me and it's a shame because I heard so many fantastic things about it, but sadly all it did was make me hate The Wailing more.3/10"
" I love Korean horror... but not this
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,6,2 hours 36 minutes of my life I'll never get back.
" Awesome movie.
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,7,"It's a long movie but its a excellent movie with twist and turns, suspence till the last . Go for it without any hesitation. Ignore negative ratings."
" One of the most unsettling horror films I've ever seen. A gem!
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,10,"Recently bought the DVD of The Wailing and settled down to watch it last night. By the end of the film I was emotionally exhausted, and sat in silence for a few mins, stunned.I've seen thousands of horror films over the last 40 years, and this gem up there with best of them.It starts off a bit chaotic, with some goofy humour, but then slowly pulls you into a much darker tale, twisting the knife a little more with every scene.A masterclass in unsettling, unnerving, terrifying, horror, brilliantly acted and directed, with a layered script that will definitely demand revisits over time.But not for a bit. I need to build my courage up again."
" One of the most underrated horror gems🙌
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,10,"This film.. waah. Where do i begin. Everything you look for in a horror, thriller, suspense, mystery film is in this very movie. This film will have you on the edge of your seat the entire way through. Although abit slow at the beginning, the rest of the movie is fast paced and gives you another level of anxiety. Definitely not for the faint hearted skittish audience. Hands down goes in my top 4 horror films of all time!🖤🔥"
" Koreans have the best actors.
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,6,"Very long, slow paced with great acting and a bit complex and confusing plot, but wasn't bad."
" I'm used to trust in the reviews but ..
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,5,"...what a dissapointment.Poor characters.Repetitive and overlong scenes.Laughable ""horror"" moments.Poor writing.The movie accomplishes a little bit in the genre, but not much more. I regret giving my time to this film."
" Excellent Example of Korean Horror
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,8,"Korean film makers know how to make a good horror movie and this is a fine example of that. Taking time to build good characters, disturbing themes, continued story twists, allegories, symbolism and atmosphere. This one has it all. A sign of a good horror movie is when you feel attached, even emotional for the characters. You have to feel for them to be afraid; something this film does well.My only real complaint; maybe a touch too long and maybe a little to vague for some viewers."
" One time watchable
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,6,"The movie has not a good story, only one time watchable."
" Niche Masterpiece...
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,6,"But a total miss for me.The movie was pretty good, albeit a bit slow.The acting was excellent, and the cinematography, etc were all good. (Probably 8/10) Seriously, the performances were just fantastic, and I couldn't recommend it enough from that perspective.What loses me most is exorcism type stories. I don't find them even a little scary at all. This is because of real personal experience in dealing with these types of kids. Not possessions, but kids people can't understand and/or deal with. I have dealt with dozens of kids, many are far worse in real life. None of whom are actually demon possessed. That 'scary' scene just makes me laugh.The next big loss is that the story actually loses a lot of ambiguity towards the third act, and the story forces you to see only one limited viewpoint from that moment to the end. The first act really has you wondering about what is happening. but it drains away through the whole movie."
" Overrated
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,7,"I think this movie was worth watching. Can't say it's bad. But it's unnecessarily too long, you'll see adult men acting like little girls in the face of fear. there are a lot of unanswered questions in the end, and the whole thing basically doesn't make much sense. To be honest, I thinks most people are giving this movie such high ratings just because it's Korean."
" Awful
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,4,Poor plot line and most importantly not scary. Complete waste of time
" A great screenplay
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,7,The twists and turns in this story seem infinite. One of the examples of a movie that takes its viewer on a ride. The tempo is great with many ups and downs while the allegory behind the story is almost as captivating as its execution.Amongst the minor flaws you may encounter is the acting style which is very different than what actors are doing in Hollywood and at moments feels a bit over the top.Regardless I think most people will enjoy the story and will be intrigued by the way its unwrapping.
" The Scariest Movie I Have Ever Seen
",2020-12-08 00:00:00,10,"I don't even want to say a word. If you're looking to be terrified, you'll find it here. Good luck."
" One of the worst movie
",2020-11-30 00:00:00,1,Wasted 2 hrs :29 mins of my life.so I m warning u save those precious time and use it for something better.
" Must watch
",2020-11-19 00:00:00,10,"Excellently written out of the box concept.
I bet you will need to view the ending explain video on YouTube to understand the entire plot.Brilliantly executed. Go for it.
Acting 4/5

" The Wailling
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,7,The Wailling was a good Korean horror film that has some great use of atmosfere and tension and some solid scares but what is even more important it teaches us some important staff about religion and faith but also with regret and revenge.Normally Japan was a Asian country that used to make a great horrors but after this one Korea showed that they arent a pushover and that they can make a very good horror film to and not just crime thrillers or crime dramas.Story was effective and chilling in some parts.Characters were interesting and i was able to find myself caring for them.Wailling was a good Korean horror
" Good Japanese Horror
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,7,"The Wailing is a good Japanese horror film. I thought begin that this was going to be a zombie film. Very grotesque scenes, yet parts of the movie was very hilarious. It is hard to know for much of the movie which way this story will lead to. Just watch and make your own opinion."
" A Surprised Korean Treat
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,8,"A Korean Cinema is a different cuisine as compare to regular Hollywood Flicks. The Wailing is a surprising piece of artistic cinema that leaves more questions than answers. It's a long movie but it builds a narrative to confuse the audience and in a good way, it doesn't relies on scary jumps and special effects. It relies on it;s story to carry forward with support from the actors which do justice to their roles. A psychological horror rather an out an out horror movie. Great cinematography and tight direction builds on the suspense. Stop comparing and you will be surprised. Key: must have patience."
" +/-
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,7,"+: Great Cinematography, entertaining, keeps you genuinely guessing, child actress was spectacular
-:uneven pacing, some overacting by adults, meandering, too many loose ends and red herrings, end felt unsatisfying"
" Too long, story makes little sense
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,5,"There were nice ideas here and movie looks good but in the end little made sense. Movie is too long so the interesting parts are burried. Unfortunately Wailing fails as horror as well. There are supernatural elements, some possesed humans and strange murders but all of it is neither scary or engaging."
" Good concept, flawed execution
",2020-10-23 00:00:00,6,"It's a bit too long and a bit too slow. It has horror elements but it really isn't a scary film. The ending is pretty good and by far the highlight of the movie.
Final rating: 6.4/10"
" Absolute horror masterpiece
",2020-10-20 00:00:00,8,"This movie is absolutely phenomenal. The acting, the cinematography, the screenwriting, the directing, it's all nearly perfect. Hyo-Jin's actress absolutely steals the show of any scene she is in. There is not one stale or bad performance! The main part of the movie that drives it into masterpiece territory, is the last 30 minutes. This movie is very scary, which is very hard to pull off when your movie has little to no jump scares. All in all, this movie is very good. 8/10"
" Exorcism overkill
",2020-10-20 00:00:00,3,"The first hour fairly entertaining, then I came to the 10-15 minute long exorcism chanting scene which I guess is why the movie was excessively long and couldn't take any more."
" A slow burning suspenseful well crafted movie
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,8,"I just got done watching the wailing and it's is a really good slow burning horror film. this film is over all is really well put together through the performances by everyone in the cast the directing ,the cinematography ,the score and it's editing These aspects are Very well done. The script is a very well paced and very suspenseful story that was reminiscent of Rosemarys it had me at times questioning what was going on luckily most of my questions were answered and the rest I had to answer myself this did lead to some moments during my watching experience where it took me out of the movie since I had to think about what was going on. While I had my minor gripes with the film I do think this is a very well crafted drama that most people should watch So if you're interested in horror films that take a back seat to gore and jump scares and focus more on characters and creating a compelling and complex narrative I'd suggest picking this one up"
" Full of thrill
",2020-10-13 00:00:00,8,The movie makes me wet.... because the movie was amazing.The story line was on point.Moreover everything was quite perfect. solid punch frim dirrector and coreographar.
" Terrible ending
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,6,"The first half of the film is funny and light hearted. The second half has a decidedly different tone to it. The transition is abrupt, which makes the second half feel disjointed from the first. That is acceptable but the ending is not. It is so terrible they should have rewritten it. It simply makes no sense and ruins the entire film. As the end credit starts rolling, my jaw drops to the floor..."
" Long boring movie that makes little to no sense
",2020-10-08 00:00:00,1,"Everyone screams and acts like a sissy teenage girl. A lot of scenes dragged unnecessary long. Started out ok, but turned dreadfully boring and tedious."
" I was on the edge of my seat.
",2020-10-07 00:00:00,10,I think south korean and Japanese cinema get the horror genre..its not about cheap jump scares but setting the tone of the environment around you...It's been a while since i saw some good thriller/horror movie..like really the last 20 min was so fkin intense.
" There basically is no conclusion/ending
",2020-10-05 00:00:00,3,"2 and 1/2 hours is a long time to commit to a movie. All throughout this movie, you expect some revelation, something to bring everything together. For all the pieces to align. Some explanation in the end about what and why everything is happening. But, in the end, your just left with questions and a lot of disappointment. I have no idea why this movie has gotten such great reviews. it's really not that good.SPOILERS.In the end when our main character confronts the lady in white. He noticed pieces throughout the movie. The clothes of two of the victims. And the lady just says 'that's not it'. Well then what is it!?!?!
WHY. What would have happened if he waited for the 3rd rooster crow? Would the daughter have still murdered the mother and grandmother but have walked thru the gate and been healed? There's just no explanation at the end.
The entire ending with the Japanese man was just absolutely awful and I hated it.The main actor was great and it was shot really well, but that's not even close to making this watchable. hard pass for me.
Still the best thriller in my opinion is Memories of Murder and nothing else has ever come close."
" One of my favorites
",2020-09-28 00:00:00,9,"I first saw this movie over a year ago and I loved it. I wasn't tracking my movies and rating them back then so I decided to revisit it today.I've decided this is one of my favorite horror movies. I love Korean and Japanese horror, so maybe I'm biased. But this is exactly the type of film I look for. Dark, mysterious, maybe a little supernatural, and no jump scares. It's not the type of film to be always on the move trying to get you to jump out of your seat. It unnerves you, makes you think, makes you feel for the characters. There's even some well placed humor here and there, making the characters seem more realistic, not everyone is so glum and serious in real life.There's also of course a lot of gore, but it's not just a zombie flick if that's what you're expecting. Be prepared for lots of twists and turns, this movie is a lot deeper than it appears on the surface."
" Waste of time
",2020-09-27 00:00:00,5,Not a single likable character in the movie. The main protagonist inspector was cringe to say the least. After sitting for 2 and half hour you get half of a story. So many unanswered questions. Pointless movie. One good thing i have to say about the movie is locations and cinematography.
" Reviews got me hyped for nothing!
",2020-09-23 00:00:00,2,"It's really bad, the acting is aight' but the writing is just awful.. Not the ""posessed"" people are the Problem, the main characters are so badly written the things they do make no sense at all. The movie is too long for what it is and all I was hoping for was that it will get better because of the good reviews here but it just got cringe and hard to watch. I watched the whole thing because I thought something mindblowing will happen but there was nothing! Just don't watch it, for the sake of your time. It's not creepy at all and boring af, there is a scene where a guy does some shaman BS and he does this like 15-20 mins. And the whole scene you just hear drums and loud people it was almost the worst Part of the movie and I wish I ended it there but I watched it till the end and Oh boy.. It was REALLY not worth it!"
" One of the best disturbing horror film
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,9,Even with slow pace and some questionable character action The Wailing still give me one of the best disturbing horror story its also have a good cinematic and great cast of actor
" Overrated
",2020-09-19 00:00:00,5,"I was pretty excited for this movie after my friend suggested me & also after seeing film's high rating.In starting, film was going in good pace but after 45 minutes I was not able to take it anymore. It was unnecessary stretched. The director could have shown us much better in 2hr 30min.In between the movie, I was confused if I was watching horror or drama movie. I can keep on going on how bad this movie is compared to the reviews you read here.Overall, will not recommend this movie. Will recommend you to see better movies of same runtime (2hr 30min)."
" An excellent film in the horror genre
",2020-09-02 00:00:00,3,"What I can say mostly about this movie is that if you don't mind reading subtitles for 2½ hours then this movie's for you. Me, I rather read the book if it's available in English."
" A great mystery that becomes nonsensical
",2020-09-01 00:00:00,5,"The first 2/3rds of this movie were extremely enjoyable. I didn't mind the slight mixing of genres, it gave the town a atmosphere that let the viewers know that it is usually a fairly relaxed place, and the activities are very out of the ordinary.However during the final 1/3rd of the movie I became bored of trying to figure things out, and it quickly became clear that all the answers were equally wrong. This is the sort of movie that you google theories for afterwards and still come away annoyed and confused."
" A unique horror film twisted with cultural references that elevate the narrative.
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,8,"The Wailing is a fascinating twist of various horror genres that range from plague, ghosts, witchcraft, zombies, and possessions. To complicate the story even more, all of this is presented in a Korean context, which, if what I've read on the internet is true, adds countless cultural references that a Western movie watcher like myself wouldn't understand.If you want a unique horror film that's twisted into a crime procedural drama, almost like The Exorcist III (1990), I would highly recommend this film."
" The best there is.
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,10,"This is probably the best thriller out there. This is an absolutely amazing masterpiece. The plot, pace and characters are just perfect."
" Don't waste Ur time
",2020-08-21 00:00:00,1,"It's not a horror or any scary. I don't knw, is actors are acting or over reacting. Pls don't waste Ur time"
" Awful and scattered storyline with unreasonable ending
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,1,"Actually, I got fooled by the positive reviews & rating of this movie. But pls don't get fooled by the ratings. This is one of the awful horror movie I have seen in my entire life.....Oh, ""Sorry, for calling it a horror movie, there was nothing horror in this movie. Well the story buildup was nice & catchy but as the movie proceed, you start seeing the flaws in the story. There was lot of gaps in the story, this is a movie without a main characters and the top point goes to its sense less and unreasonable ending.
Do not waste your time with this movie. Any other, B grade movie will be far better than this."
" Major hyped up reviews for this flick.
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,5,Its a movie that keeps you interested but it's hard to watch such inept characters bumble through it. Not been too impressed with Korean cinema so far. They all seem to have great stories with unimpressive characters that have as much common sense as a hammer. I think many reviewer think they are true art fans if they pump up cinema made outside the US even if it's mediocre filmmaking. What makes a good or bad film has nothing to do with its origin.
" Christian Agenda movie
",2020-08-05 00:00:00,1,"Overwhelmingly Christian agenda film.
Last scene where buddha statue is shown, is dead giveaway.
Church is working to brainwash about their stupid fear, death cult religion in South Korea.
Hope Lord Jesus will give you strength to reject him."
" Chilling, gripping, beyond perfection
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,10,"Best horror movie I've watched my entire life, deserves more than just 10 stars."
" Everything about this movie...
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,1,"......drove me crazy. Starting with the buffoonish police (worse than the Keystone Cops), scenes so dark you can't see a thing and not to mention everyone absolutely screaming in every scene! I lasted about 20 minutes before I couldn't take any more. Two and a half hours of torture? Hell no! Loved Train to Busan and Parasite, but this left me grating my teeth."
" Christian propaganda at its finest.
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,1,"The movie is artistic and i would have had no problem with the film except for the party where they made the bad shaman a buddist to show that other gods and their followers are the helpers of the devil.
The artsy part is that they used a horror film to justify bad things happening to people because of not having faith or rejecting god's help(typical christian lore). The bad and the ugly part is to go an extra mile and talk about other religions in a bad way. The shaman is shown to be a helper of the devil. The film intentionally establishes that he is a Buddha worshipper before revealing that he is a helper of the devil. He can be seen with his Buddha idol once in his place and again while he packs his stuff and tries to flee in his car. The second time is when it becomes evident. In the car, the Buddha statue is placed in a way that it is seen while driving, reminding the audience that he is Buddhist. Then later it is revealed that he helped the devil in misleading regular folks away from god's help by deceiving them and towards sin.
The Bible talks about other religions and their goods in a similar fashion. Bible says other spirits/gods that don't acknowledge Jesus/god is anti-christ or helpers of the devil.
It is one thing to throw in Bible references and using a little scare while promoting ones own religion but it is a new low for mainstream movie makers to throw mud on other's religions. It is disrespectful on the part of the writer and director Na Hong Jin. Another bad apple coming from a bad tree."
" is this even a horror movie?
",2020-07-13 00:00:00,4,"You know. There is the ""British humour"" that makes no one laugh, and there is the Korean horror that makes no one shiver.
The movie is just a slightly macabre version of ""Laurel & Hardy"", where hysterical characters in a rural Korean province are victims of a demonic possession.
No scare jumps. No dark atmospheres. No spine-chilling soundtrack. No growing tension in the plot. No suspence. The only good thing is that at least it's not the usual story of a catholic exorcism (this time it's about korean shamanism)."
" Fantastic Suspense Horror
",2020-07-12 00:00:00,8,"I loved this Korean horror, it has suspense, gore, and a twist. The Korean are doing it right at the moment they are letting the story captivate you instead of Hollywood were its all about the gimmicks"
" Horror movie genre redefined.
",2020-07-12 00:00:00,10,"Okay I dont write a lot of reviews, only for the ones I like a lott and this movie is one of them. Its one of the top 3 horror movies Ive ever watched. What do you see in today's horror movies? Jump scares and scary ghosts but this movie has redefined the horror movie genre. Without any jump scares or any scary looking ghosts it scares the crap out of you. It keeps you on the edge. Yes it takes some time to build up the story but it is worth it. A must watch."
" Curiously overrated
",2020-07-10 00:00:00,5,"Strange. Take 10 minutes to check all the reviews here. The cautious reader will notice a large amount of repetition in the wording of reviews, allegedly by different people. The word ""masterpiece"" is thrown around quite a bit and many gave this film a 9 or 10 out of 10. I am here to say that this is not a perfect film as claimed by these reviews.Go ahead. Give this movie half an hour. Do you agree it's a masterpiece yet? If you're worried about unfairly judging it, sacrifice the whole 2-and-a-half hours of your life. If you believe it's a masterpiece as alleged by that point, please post your review explaining why.My issues:* As pointed out by many reasonable viewers on this site, the main characters were laughable - Korean keystone cops! Literally falling around on the ground, screaming and yelling at every opportunity, and just generally doing a poor job. Hello writers - your protagonist has to be relatable and no-one wants to relate to a bumbling fool.* Which reminds me - to preemptively shut up the patronizing racists who gave this movie a 10 out of 10 (!!!) simply because it's Korean / ""foreign"", no, it's not a cultural difference thing. Memories of Murder was a great Korean film featuring cops that suffered few if any of the ridiculous flaws that this alleged masterpiece has.* The movie didn't know if it wanted to be a comedy, action, horror, thriller, mystery, or....anything. Many simple tropes are thrown around, most with no clear resolution.* Uh, The Irishman was too long - and this ain't no Irishman. There is no excuse for dragging this mess on for 2 1/2 hours. Poor editing.* Terrible writing. What was the point of the priest and / or the shaman? Was the villain a Japanese guy just because of racism? What was the real story with the female ghost? Was the kid still haunted at the end? Whatever happened with the dude in the pickup truck? Come on - after giving hours of our lives to this thing at least throw some basic answers our way.Stay cautious. Most critical reviews are trying to warn / help you. The glowing reviews are almost certainly shills or idiots ( 10 out of 10? Really?). Don't waste your time like I did. Yes, this movie delivers on wailing during the movie - there's a lot of it - but you don't want to be wailing AFTER it."
" A waste of time
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,1,Can't they do anything better? Rubbish. They should be ashamed
" Patience and (or) trust
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,10,"Watching this, quite a few things may confuse you. The story is not easy at all. It is about good and evil though. It is about how we perceive the world and what we make of it. It is about many things, a lot of you may experience and see, that the person next to you may not see.The movie is made to be watched more than once. I had heard about the Wailing and how good it supposedly is - well now I can leave the supposedly part away. It is as good as people say it is. And it is another example of south korean filmmaking that not few see as a powerhouse in the world right now (some may argue it has been for quite some time now). This movie is another example for just that.It is also a movie about prejudice, about how small our world is and how we react to an outside ""influence"". How things collapse and what society is capable of ... again so many things to discover here. Now that being said, it doesn't mean you will like the movie. Or that if you don't like it, it doesn't mean you have no taste in movies. That is the great thing about films. We all have different tastes and we all value things different. You may just want to see explosions. And that's more than fine. But it's not what you'll get here ... not for the weak hearted or squeamish just to be clear though ... this is brutal .. to watch!"

",2020-06-12 00:00:00,8,"An excellent movie. This is a must see film. This movie really works your brain in some parts too. This is my first foreign horror film and I can tell you right now this is leaving an amazing first impression. Korea brought us Parasite and this? Incredible. Within the top 3 horror films of the past 10 years, it's that good"
" Such a roller coster, this isn't just a scary movie
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,9,"I learnt a lot about fate in this movie, i can reflect a lot about devil because i have a religion to begin with. Never have i ever reflect about what happened in my life after watching scary movie, except ""munafik"" and this movie. It scares me and stress me so much, but i still accept and enjoy the movie. The plot twisted was really effective and good, it made movie better, i wondered what happen if they just make it simple and subtle, it will still be great i guess, but not this great as what happened after the plot twist."
" 1 hour too long mashed genre
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,5,If you watch this movie without knowing the synopsis you will keep guessing what this movie is all about.. Is it a crime movie? Is it a zombie movie or a monster movie? The early part is too slow and filled with annoying stupidity of those sissy policemen.. The multiple plot twists within the last 10 minutes are the only part that I enjoy but it could not save the whole rhythm of this movie.. Its unsettling but it does not create a lasting impression.. Well at least for me
" This film has more loose threads than a five dollar t-shirt.
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,3,"Don't do it! I did and I'm kicking myself. Every single scene is overly drawn out. I suppose that's meant to somehow build suspense, or atmosphere... or something. It doesn't. It just means more waiting for the ""denouement"" to arrive. And it never does! The only reason I didn't skip through it is because it was hard enough to follow at normal speed, and in a foreign language to boot!I DESPISE cowardly film makers who can't commit to a coherent ending. You're in the wrong field, ya time wasting losers. Either grow a pair or GTHO of the biz.If you decide to watch it anyway, at least put on some soft footwear beforehand, because you WILL kick yourself after sitting through this 60 minute horror ""episode""(at best) stretched out to over two and a half hours.You have been warned."
" An astonishing descent into hell
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,9,"This film is certainly not for everyone. If you are not a fan of the horror genre, you will probably find this film very difficult to watch. But I must say it was an astonishingly unique. A great perspective. An incredibly creepy and dark vision, and a fantastic execution of that vision. And a film that just transports you to a totally unique cinematic universe. Great characters. Great character development. Great performances. Fantastic direction. Very well written. This is a great film. Hollywood just does not know how to do movies like this. Horror has a different name and a different face in Korea. And it is not the weak, sanitized Hollywood version of it. But rather a vision of darkness and Hell on Earth. And total devastation. This movie was amazing. Korean cinema rocks! Why this director has not done dozens of movies is a real puzzle."
" Do not believe the hype
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,2,"With nothing but stellar reviews, 25 minutes in, the plot a shambles and the film boring, I had to check that I was watching the right flick!
One hour later, it occurred to me that this disaster of storytelling still had an hour to run... which, unfortunately, I sat through like a severe test of patience.Come the ending, I honestly wish I hadn't bothered and that more negative - sorry, realistic - reviews/comments of this overly long, dire mess of a film were being published, as I felt both cheated by the hype and resentful for the time invested in such crap.Note to nerds: not everything from Korea is a ""masterpiece""; sadly, this film is a great example."
" Trash
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,2,What in the holy jesus did I just watch? This movie was a complete waste of time. There is literally no plot in this movie. Nada. It's a mix of genres that drives you crazy. Don't believe the good reviews on here. Skip it.2 stars for the cinematography.
" Worst cops ever!
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,8,The story is good in general. With a pair of good cops the length of the movie will be much shorter
" Worth your 2.5 hours.
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,8,"The story starts in a small hilly South Korean village, where reports are coming of people dying mysteriously. Symptoms include rashes on the skin, and the victim becoming hyperactive.
The primary suspect is an old Japanese guy, who people thought, might have brought a virus with him, while others have a different theory about him.
The movie contains concepts of Korean and Japanese folklore, and might be worth of its time span. Its upon you, if you love horror movies with a thrill/twist in the plot at the end, this is for you."
" As Good as the Reviews Say
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,8,"I refer to both the user reviews and the professional reviews in the ""External Review"" section you get when clicking on ""More"" (near top of page).Running over two and a half hours is usually a bad sign for for both comedy and horror films. Not so here. Not a wasted shot, scene, or character. Everyone cast is perfect for the role they play.I did find it hard to champion the lead as he was clearly a cowardly man. Yet he was a police Sargent! The only times he showed strength was when angry or dealing with what was possessing his daughter. Otherwise he was a cry baby! The other Korean men did not fair much better.Is this an accurate portrayal of men in that culture? I suppose every culture has it's men who are more children than men. Or were they portrayed as such to give the film a comic relief amid the horror?? The Shaman was an exception.Fine story with surprising twists. I recommend it to all who can watch foreign films with subtitles."
" maybe some scenes won't be 100% understood by ""foreigners"", but it has unforgetable moments, a focus a vision, heart, it's scary and very well developed.
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,9,"I'm one of them - i'm from south europe, so pretty much far away from south korea. maybe i'm very wrong but there's some rituals here, some beliefs that seem specific to the country, even to the area where the director and screenwriter is from or has roots. not that us ""outsiders"" are unable to understand the whole thing, but maybe some specifications this movie presents won't be that well understood because there's some cultural background missing (and i already read one review that mentions some of it).the truth is: the movie works in all parameters for me: as an horror flick? definitely. a lot of scenes are very scary. as a horror comedy? yes, there are some fun bits here too. as a mystery? yes, we keep on guessing until the end, we don't know who's telling the truth after all. as a family drama: oh, definitely. now, are the themes here the ones i would put in a movie of mine? probably not. but that doesn't matter, it matters if they work in this film and they totally do.the characters: they do work, mostly the father and the daughter. but above all we can understand their decisions, because a lot of them are based on impulses, like you know? regular people. i also enjoyed the japanese man and the guy that comes to help, i think this latter guy has really cool scenes that i never saw that well portrayed in a movie. the plot is intricate yes, but i don't think it's that hard to follow. it's layered? it is. it has some stuff i didn't understand completely? yes. but the whole picture i didn't believe that hard to get.so: very good acting - mostly the daughter, layered characters, rich script , great pace (2 hours and a half...maybe in the first hour you have doubts, but when you understand what this movie is about, it flows wonderfully), very solid direction, beautiful cinematography... and above all a competence to make very unforgetable scenes. this is a movie that sticks with you, even if you didn't feel it in your guts: it's not a movie i totally identify with (mainly because of some of the themes), but is a piece of craft i can't anything but admire. be prepared: you really might love this one. very very well done."
" Needed tightening
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,5,"Painfully long. Several really stupid moments in the plot. Scenes where the oafish cop (who really should not have been a cop, it would have made more sense) emotes in overwrought ways. Director Na Hong-jin seems to elongate and repeat everything, and I thought that the bloat took away from the horror. I also didn't care much for the Japanese demonization and tossing the word Jap around, even though I understand at least a little about the painful history. The cinematography was solid and the final scene was pretty cool, but it came way too late. This film should have been an hour shorter and its script tuned to make more sense."
" Ambiguous with some wasted potential
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,5,"I am not going to sing praises for this movie as I thought it was far too long with some meandering plot and many small things adding up to be bothersome, but my personal interpretation left me feeling satisfied enough once it was finally over. I believe there is ambiguity in good or evil because there are no clear lines much like with real people. I think this is some kind of universe where there are unknown supernatural entities operating on their own, manipulating people as pawns and meddling in each other's business along the way. It is unclear who is lying versus telling the truth, working together or completely separately, choosing victims randomly or with reasons, etc. Maybe the woman was truthful and the shaman and Japanese man were in cahoots. Or maybe the Japanese man was truly a shaman, died in the car wreck, and was ultimately possessed or provided another vessel for the shaman or whatever empowered him. I don't think any logic can tie everything and everyone together so this is the most sensible solution in my mind. Viewers and characters end up assigning meaning to things that may not have meaning at all."
" Do we really understand the true nature of God?
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,7,"""The Strangers"" from Hong-Jin Na is a thriller horror film. We all remember the very good 2008 ""The Chaser"" from the same director who won best Director and best film at the 45th Grand Bell Awards. ""The Chaser"" is probably one of his best works to date and one of the best thriller horror movies of recent years. I strongly advise to give it a watch. But let's go back to ""The Strangers"" aka ""The Wailing"".
Release in 2016 the film depicts a series of strange events and the spread of a mysterious disease happening in a little South Korean village soon after the arrival of a Japanese stranger. The film begins with an excerpt from the Bible. Luke 24:38, to be precise: ""Why are you troubled"" Jesus asked, ""and why do doubts arise in your hearts? Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself."" Then we see the first shot involving a fisherman hanging worms on the hook of his fishing rod. Those details may seem unimportant but believe me they are the keys to understand this story of demonic possession and trickery between our revealed world and the hidden one.
In 156 minutes Hong-Jin Na explores through the eye of a policeman and his family the nature of men when face against irrational and obscure events. The result is a slow burning movie riddled with tension, horror, a sense of loss of control over the events but also funny parts and clownish characters who struggle to make sense of what is happening to them. If Life was a game where traps are set by hidden entities only for humans to fall into it, then ""The Strangers"" could be the very depiction of this game. The film bates us with the story of a bizarre stranger who seems confronted against racism only to reshuffle the cards half way with stories of bizarre strangers manipulating our belief or/and our superstitions and questioning the very nature of what we believe in. Nothing is what it seems to be...
""The Strangers"" is not a perfect movie, too long, unbalanced, hesitating on what the film wants to be, it's probably one of Hong-Jin Na less controlled film. However this lack of control is largely offset by the originality of its subject, the questioning the movie leads to and the horror it inserts in our mind, on par if not more subtle than what ""The Exorcist"" proposed a few decades earlier. It's definitely not for everyone but if you like unsettling movies then ""The Strangers"" is for you and will leave you with one haunting question: do we really understand the true nature of God?"
" I really enjoyed this.
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,9,"Mystery, suspense, comedy and horror all rolled into one epic crazy film. Loved it!"
" Masterpiece!
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,10,"Another Korean film that really impressed me so much. This film is absolutely broke your faith again and again. So don't trust anyone😐. All aspects is perfect. And the most important is the jumpscare moment is just once😂 The rest of it is just a brilliant and scary atmosphere that not so many Hollywood movie can't do right now. If you haven't watch this movie yet, I recommend you to watch this movie ASAP bcs this is a masterpiece!"
" Best Horror movie so far
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,10,Have seen many horror movies from across the world. Nothing beats this one. Most of the time it is difficult to judge of a character is good or evil. The exorcism scene with the sharman was too good. Would recommend to watch this in one go.
" I saw the devil is the perfect name for this movie
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,7,"I have to say i like this movie although i don't like horror movies ..
this movie should exchange its name with the other Korean movie "" I Saw the devil""
as its the real meaning of this movie
Korean movies every time shock us how they so clever and can use the music and camera in a very good way you can feel that via the point of view scenes with the Japanese man killing scenes
i have my explaination for the end of the movie but i still confused about that i thought the Japanese man is the Satan and the shaman his upper hand as i thought the shaman worship this Satan and pray for him and they have a deal and as i thought this shaman become famous as he can chase the ghosts and the Satan or Japanese man help him for many times and at this time the shaman have to pay back all what the Satan give to him so when the shaman make the party for chasing the devil from her body that's wrong he was strength the Existence of the Satan inside her body .. and about the white girl you can say she is a good soul who try to face this Satan at the end every this is appearing clear"
" Hong-jin Na's Horror Epic
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,6,"Here is a movie that got a tremendous amount of praise from critics and viewers as being a memorable horror film. I thought it was well filmed and acted, especially the child actress. This might be the most intense performance a child actor has given on film. The story definitely made me care about the characters, and when it was over, I wanted to know more about what I had just watched. However, after taking time to reflect and review some of the interpretations that have been put out there, I've decided that The Wailing didn't quite meet my expectations. It was hard to follow, and most people seem to understand that the director wanted some things to be intentionally vague. But what bothered me is that I felt like the story kept introducing new plot points that didn't seem connected to what had come before. When I got to the end and saw what other people had to say about what was going on, it didn't do anything to deepen my appreciation of the movie. It's long, too, and it feels like it meanders, even if everything does somehow tie together at the end. I just didn't respond that strongly to it. I think some of the imagery will stick with me, but I don't feel like I enjoyed it enough to want to watch it back. I can't say that I don't recommend it, because obviously a lot of people really enjoyed it, I just didn't happen to be one."
" not a bad movie
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,8,"Firstly, let me say if you want to see how average everyday South Koreans live, then this movie is for you. I've lived in Korea 2 years and was in and out of the country for the next 3 years. The movie shows actual Korean housing, not the fancy apartments you normally see in a Korean movie. It shows them eating breakfast(meaning they do actually eat kimchee every meal) and even shows the wife doing laundry the Korean way. Not with a washing machine.The movie starts off fairly comical and jovial. I found myself thinking, what the hell am I watching. All I can say, since I was there in the 80's, the Koreans have come a long way in horror type movies. In those days I couldn't even get my girlfriends to go watch American horror films. And the Korean horror movies were equivalent to American horror movies from the 40's. This movie I wouldn't even consider to be horror, more of a suspense thriller. But it was well worth watching nonetheless. I can't say the ending would be my favorite as they throw a few curveballs. But still, if you like a good decent foreign up and coming genre of Korean horror, give it a couple of hours and enjoy."
" A big build up to not much
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,6,"Not enough here to recommend it.Good acting, great scenery, nice atmosphere.. But the story goes nowhere.A few tweaks and it would have been very good.But in the end it's just a ""Who is the real bad guy?"" story.Convoluted. Unsatisfying and a little simple.Imagine someone tells you that you are going out to dinner at a fancy restaurant. You get dressed up, a limo picks you up, you drive to the expensive part of the city. They have you put on a blindfold so you dont know which restaurant you are going to.... and then when you take off the blindfold it is Wendy's burger joint.Hey, there are worst places to eat, but the build up made me think this was going to be a special meal. It wasn't."
" Decent enough
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,6,"Decent movie with great acting, but bogged down by a horrible, horribly written script. At the end, absolutely nothing makes sense. They try to throw you red herrings that are, then are not red herrings. It's just a complete mess."
" Hauntingly thrilling
",2020-03-17 00:00:00,9,"This movie is not the classic horror movie we have all seen. The movie depicts the weaknesses of human along with the endless troubles he will take for his loved ones. The story weaves through superstitions, folklores, strange dreams, anecdotes all pointing to a strange japanese man as the cause of all evil things that happen in a village . Is he the real culprit? Is he human or devil ? Are they simply superstitions? These questions are thrown to the viewers from the very beginning....."
" Goksung
",2020-02-27 00:00:00,5,"With some interest, with a mixture of mystery, horror and comedy. The end is not very explicit and relatively open and with turnarounds, although noticeable."

" One of the best horror movies that work on a psychological level (A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,10,"South Korea proved to be one of the few countries than can really terrify its audience while having really excellent stories, characters and meanings. ""Goksung"" is one of them. 2016 was THE year for South Korean cinema. This one might not be for everyone, especially if you wacth it at night ,This movie is so well written and so complex. Not only is it great horror, but it also makes you really think. It's worth your time to google the meaning of the movie, since it isn't completely obvious. You'll enjoy it either way The ending hits you hard"
" Voyage of Grief and other Mish Mash
",2020-02-05 00:00:00,6,"An interesting and fresh view regarding the increasing horror of the father as he he sees his daughter succumbing to a mysterious disease that is consuming families high up on a mountain.
He and his family try the services of shaman to ward off the sickness but to no avail. Similarly the priest and the Japanese Buddhist Monk (which seem to have a standoff at the end of the picture a la Twin Peaks) seem to be ineffective. Thrown in is a mysterious woman dressed in white who make casual apparitions to ward off the evil afflicting the community
I found the film interesting though the director purposely seem to leave the film without a resolution. His message is kind of you see and react to what you believe in whatever affliction you are undergoing through. The change of tones from comedy to drama to tragedy are masterfully done, however from dramedy to zombie film to revenge story and back and forth seem jarring
The film intentionally focuses on the child's father and his mates whilst keeping the rest of the family in the background. I sort of missed other points of view especially with the pending horror"
" Terrifying
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,9,"There are no jumpscares, no creepy violin musin, no CGI-made scary monsters, and yet this film are terrifying as hell. The growing feeling of imminent doom in this movie made me feel really uncomfortable, and i am by no means a novice in horror genre."
" Could the ending have made less sense?
",2020-01-18 00:00:00,2,"Sorry but I don't want to create my own ending hypothesis. I want the director to finish his or her thought. For Pete's sake, there is zero continuity to this movie's ending. It appears the lady in white was telling the truth about him waiting 3 crows to go home, but then she said the shaman and old man were in together. How is this possible when the Shaman nearly killed the old man until dumbo cop stopped him from performing the ritual. But the shaman said the old man was a shaman like him and a good guy yet he turns into the devil. Zero logic Zero sense so you're only getting 2 stars for taking away 2.5 hours of my life."
" Gets under your skin and wriggles around.
",2020-01-08 00:00:00,8,"'The Wailing (2016)' is an affair that sticks with you, leaving you to turn it over and over in your mind long after its credits have rolled. It's a constantly evolving experience, moving through several somewhat distinct acts defined only by your understanding of its plot's events. This is evidence of its keen awareness of its audience, as it is able to predict what you're thinking in order to set up a blindsiding reveal. A lot of the narrative is ambiguous, despite a fairly concrete end, and it makes for an extremely enigmatic watch, one in which your assumptions are always shifting and, somehow, never quite correct. When you think back on the piece, you realise how meticulously crafted it is right from the opening shot. It's exactly what it needs to be, even if it does sometimes seem slightly meandering and you can certainly feel its length. It's never even close to boring, constantly keeping you engaged and occasionally wrenching you to the edge of your seat. It's the kind of film that sneaks up on you; you don't realise your heart is in your mouth until it's too late. It's as much a mystery as it is a horror, but it's ultimately rather frightening. It has moments of wince-inducing gore, creepy imagery and unbearable tension but it's its overall effect that affects you the most. It's difficult to describe, really, but to say the picture is ominous is an understatement. Its only real flaw is the fact that some of its odd comedy, particularly in its earlier sequences, detracts ever-so-slightly from the sincerity of its narrative. Still, even this contributes to the story's decidedly off-kilter vibe. When it comes down to it, the thing is absolutely brilliant, a distinct and distinguished movie unlike most others of its kind. It gets under your skin and wriggles around for a long time. 8/10"

" The Death Stranding of Korean horror
",2019-12-28 00:00:00,5,"I don't understand the remarkable amount of praise being heaped on this movie.One of the problems that I have found with Korean movies in general, and specifically Korean horror over the last decade or so, is the prevalence of slapsticky characters. I'm not even sure if this is deliberate on the part of the filmmakers, or if it is just part of how the general Korean acting style has evolved over decades.
The protagonist is this chubby cop who is constantly falling down and shooting goofy looks directly at the camera. He also cries in every other scene, and by the end of the movie, I was thoroughly annoyed and couldn't care less about what he was going through. And he goes through some REALLY bad s-t at the end.This is subjective though, as some people won't have a problem with this. Some people won't care about crying and falling over.
But I think MOST people WILL care about the fact that this movie is almost 2 1/2 hours, and almost 90 minutes of this runtime is a red herring.Without spoiling anything, there is also a very familiar horror trope that pops up in the second half of the movie; one that I'm pretty sure no one is impressed by, much less scared by.The movie does look really nice, the cinematography and scenery are beautiful, and it has generally good performances, the one caveat being the lead actor."
" Film Deftly Evolves From Moderately Humorous to Terrifying, and Ends Leaving One Speechless.
",2019-12-28 00:00:00,8,"The protagonist, a marginally incompetent policeman, endears himself to viewers with his less than motivated, 'everyday guy' approach to his civil service career. An unrelenting series of gruesome murders begins to change the tenor of this film as the sergeant's investigation becomes more earnest. When the horrors in his village continue, and an evil entity is suspected, the sergeant becomes more focused. As this malevolence begins to manifest itself in his daughter, his unfailing devotion to her allays his fears and drives him to become singularly possessed with confronting this evil. At this point, any humor has vanished from this film.This film, like the antagonistic entity it features, is remarkably deceptive and will keep you guessing right up to the last minute. (I felt as if all of the air had been sucked out of the room when it ended.) To have so successfully pulled this off, Do-won Kwak (actor portraying the police sergeant) gives nothing short of an A-list performance--which I wasn't expecting."
" One of the best asian horror/mystery movies

" Eighth film of my life to be considered a masterpiece
",2019-12-21 00:00:00,10,"I don't often use the word masterpiece. I've seen 1,040 films in my life, totalling 1,549 hours of filmography. There's maybe 7 I would label a masterpiece with full usage and definition of the word.The Wailing is the eighth film of one thousand and forty films I very willingly, gladly and without hesitation give the title of Masterpiece to.I'm not too big of a fan of Asian supernatural horror. Whilst I very much enjoy it and give most films a pretty decent average rating, I find a lot of them bleed into one another with similar plots and a very safe view on the supernatural. In Japan it tends to be curses that have people die in mysterious ways, South Korea, a cursed object that has people murder each other are the most common ones I come across.When I clicked The Wailing was supernatural, I prepared myself for a 6 or maybe 7 out of 10 movie that was good but wouldn't hold its own too well in the vast expanse of horror.The Wailing gave me some stunning frames. The cinematography in this is beautiful. The gore frames are gruesome, unadulterated and unapologetic. The ritualism and belief of South Korea are shown in their full glory without fear. Na Hong Jin doesn't shy away from racial tension between the Japanese and South Koreans with a slightly historical take with a beautiful twisting story that left me with my mouth gaping open but still feeling just slightly uncomfortable - something I believe Hong Jin did on purpose. I was shown acting that was so well done, no matter what I watch these actors in from now on, I will always know them from The Wailing. The varying supernatural aspects were unique, something that stunned me, unafraid to step out of genre restrictions and lead the way with something new. With a story line that is intriguing, stunning and just raw, this two and a half hour journey was worth watching.This is a film deserving of the hype that numerous other Asian horrors got but turned out to be predictable messed. THIS is the Korean horror of 2016, the one that should have lead the forefront of South Korean, or even Asian, horror into 2017. This is a film that shows prowess, promise and skill. Hong Jin treats us to such wonderful skills from not just himself but his script writer, his cast, his editing team, his make up team, etc, everyone involved. You can feel the passion and love and pure dedication that went into this movie.A full 10/10 is just not enough for this film.A twisting, numbing, horrifying masterpiece."
" Confusing for non-Koreans
",2019-12-11 00:00:00,7,"The Wailing is a long film, over two hours. It certainly keeps you guessing, right to the end, and the solution could just as easily have been biological as spiritual. It does end well, and is satisfying. Not so satisfying are some of the plot holes and the way Koreans interact. The main man is abused by his superior, and he in turn abuses his junior. That was totally unnecessary, didn't work as humour and didn't help you identify with the hero. It's also hard to understand the cultural difference. First there is the language, which seems to use a lot of words sometimes for a quick reaction, or barely a sound for whole sentences. Also culturally it is hard to place the little village where the action takes place. On the one hard there are advanced police techniques and a well-equiped modern hospital, where on the other hand people seem to prefer rumour as truth, shaman magic and acupuncture and herbs to remedy their ills. A small child at one point has an extreme rash over half of her body, yet the hospital doesn't think it warranted to keep her in overnight for observation or further tests to find out what's wrong with her. Many conversations seem unfinished. OK. It's a Korean movie, and thus you expect all the characters to be quirky and garrulous. Even so, there's a lot of unnecessary swearing and odd reactions. As horror it's kind of bumbling, but also kind of original. The cinematography was terrific and that's what really got me through the two hours. It's wonderful to see another culture photographed well. Definitely worth a look, but I'd hesitate to want to sit through it again."
" All that wailing without a payoff
",2019-11-25 00:00:00,4,"To call The Wailing tonally inconsistent is an understatement. This film is a big fail on two levels: first it needs some serious chopping in the editing room. At least 30 minutes of tedious shamanistic drum beating and moronic cop antics could have been left on the cutting room floor, and the movie would have been better because of it.
Second, the plot makes no sense either way you look at it. We are given two potential culprits behind the mayhem in the village resulting in zombie-like symptoms in the ""infected"" citizens. Two possible antagonists, and by the end, we still are left with two possibilities. But neither one makes much sense, in the context of the film's narrative.
If mood was everything in assessing a horror film's quality, The Wailing receives a B+ in that category - when the scenes don't include the Keystone Cops crying like little girls, or long closeups of people paralyzed with fear, staring in horror at bloody carnage.
But making viewers endure 2 1/2 hours of suspenseful buildup without providing a sufficient climactic payoff is unforgivable. No amount of style can make up for the egregious lack of substance in this film.
For top notch horror, rewatch The Ring or The Orphanage or Audition. The Wailing will have you wailing for your 2 1/2 hours back."
" Horror masterpiece
",2019-11-15 00:00:00,10,Every second of this film drips with mystery and dark foreboding horror. Another superb Korean masterpiece
" One of the Best Horror Films of the Decade
",2019-11-06 00:00:00,10,"The Wailing is my favorite horror movie, it's perfect for this Halloween season, and just a good, entertaining, intelligent movie that can be dissected any time throughout the year. Although the runtime is imposing, every single minute is crafted in the hands of director Na Hong-Jin, who goes to great lengths to show off his craft, by creating a deep, layered, yet simple story, filled with humor, followed by dread and evil, each character being three dimensional, fitting into the mold that has been cast for them. From the chilling beginning, the horrific nightmarish middle, to the bone rattling, no hope for anyone twist ending that will linger in the minds of viewers long after the credits roll. The Wailing is about making choices and the consequences that come with those choices, it's about man versus evil and at what lengths one will go to protect that which one loves, no matter the end result. I cannot recommend this film enough to those who are willing to take the journey, and if you do prepare yourself for one hell of a ride."
" Fantastic
",2019-10-03 00:00:00,9,"Yes it's long, yes it's a little confusing, but stick with it and you will be rewarded with a superbly made horror film that shows up most American movies in the genre."
" Masterful storytelling
",2019-09-08 00:00:00,8,"One of my favorite horror films I've seen in the past 5 years. It's suspenseful, clever, and most importantly, a real slow burner putting you through all sorts of emotion and trepidation before revealing what some may say is an ambiguous ending but, in my opinion, tells you all you need to know. It's an exhausting experience but worth the trip.
Watching it for a second time and knowing what happens really lets you see all the details and methodical work the creators put into this film.
South Korean truly makes phenomenal films."
" what the heck!?
",2019-08-29 00:00:00,1,"I really don't get the love for this terrible movie, how on earth this got above a 4 is beyond me. Two cops screaming at each other and one getting caught having sex by his daughter. I have no idea why comedy isn't listed under this movie because it certainly is not horror. The cinematography was ok, nice in parts but several obvious film set scenes ruin the mood. The acting was weak and the script sucked, swearing doesn't make a movie real or gritty it just kinda cheapens an already terrible experience. I'd sum this review up by saying that it was clearly trying to just imitate a trashy US zombie flick, but in doing so just came across as ridiculous and unmemorable, this is the first Korean horror flick I have seen that was in my opinion a complete waste of time. Awful!"
" Don't get hyped.
",2019-08-24 00:00:00,6,"If I had to put it short, this movie is out of place. Is not cheap horror comedy, is not thriller, is not true horror. But it tried to be all of that, in the beginning regular cop with family that is barely competed and to be such investigate strange kills, eventually getting more people involved causing the dead of his family. Well played with that Japanese guy being the good and the bad at some moments of the film, making the viewer wondering what is going on actually. The whole movie is not concentrated for the length of run."
" INTENSE ATMOSPHERE!
",2019-08-13 00:00:00,8,"Can I say 'BANGS*T'? I dont know who to trust! Though the first half is a silly cop story, the second quickly increase the tension and deliveries a great atmosphere. This is an unknown hole.. a pain hole.. an art hole. 👍👍"
" Make your own theory!
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,10,"If you like horror movies with an ambiguous ending and with no clear clue who is good and who is bad, you are in for a treat. There are tens of theories about which character is good or bad or has converted from good to bad and vice versa. Though, none of them can explain the all the events in the film!"
" my notes
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,1,"Terrible. super long and boring. i couldn't get through it. after about an hour i either watched in high speed or was half watching, more as it went along. just sucks. (1 viewing)"
" Good movie
",2019-07-14 00:00:00,7,"South Korea consistently makes more good films than any other country. One of the best horror movies of the decade. Gradually building tension, dark atmosphere, creative story with enough red herring's to keep you guessing. Highly recommended"
" Korean horror story done well
",2019-06-21 00:00:00,9,"Between native shamanism, Buddhism and Catholicism, this film takes twists and turns culminating in a unique way. Beautiful dual interplay between religions is well played out driving tension and drama. I don't recall finding this as much scary or graphic. I'd characterize this more on the order of a psychological and supernatural suspense and mystery thriller."
" Mind blowing example ...
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,9,"Of what horror movies should strive for! I had put off watching this one for a long while as it was just so long I knew I needed to have a good night to focus and really absorb it. Needless to say that wasn't hard at all. I was hooked within the first 5 mins and didn't look up from the screen until it ended. Between the excellent acting, the well constructed story, the steady flowing suspense and the breathtaking scenery there wasn't a minute that I was not completely enthralled in this story. I love horror movies, all kinds... Even some of the cheesy ones, but its always an exciting moment when I find one that is completely satisfying from start to finish.The only part I had a hard time with was when he killed the Cane Corso, but I'm a mega serious animal lover that has to admit I always have a harder time with the animals demise in horror movies than I do the people's. Even though I know its all fake lol. But that one hit in particular as that Corso looks like it could be my dogs twin...That aside, I absolutely loved the overall take away left after watching this movie and definitely recommend it to anyone that loves really good, well made horror movies."
" Probably
",2019-06-17 00:00:00,9,One of the best horror movie i've ever seen worldwide.
" Astonishing take on the horror genre.
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,8,"After a strange stranger moved into the neighborhoods of a small town, strange things begin to happen between people, violent things and macabre things.The Wailing is an exceptionally created scary movie. With an atmosphere worthy of Asian terror, our show also shows a new macabre shot in the main plot, having extremely disturbing images and scenes with extreme violence. She manages to satisfy the basic expectations of any film of her genre, but also marks herself among her style by her fantastic narrative, teaching us different options through the film through the same eyes. That's an important factor of the film, the plot turns. Very few scary movies manage to keep themselves as ''unpredictable'', The Wailing manages to stay completely between a cloud of mystery and horror, filling up with mystery every second and revealing some completely fantastic plot turns.With a beautiful scenography, fantastic performances typical of Korean cinema, with incredible sound design and some terrifying shots without overuse themselves, this film manages to cede among the classics of terror offering us a unique and demonic experience like never seen before. An excellent example of the capacity of Korean cinema and a masterpiece for the genre of terror, especially among Asian cinema, totally respectable and enjoyable."
" MUST SEE, EDGE OF THE SEAT MYSTERY HORROR THRILLER
",2019-05-30 00:00:00,10,"Drama, emotions, twists and turns and gut wrenching horror mystery. Acting does not get any better than this. Its hilarious at times for westerners but makes perfect sense in a remote Korean village where the evil has descended upon. Not very scary to me but kept me on the edge."
" Horror-Drama from South Korea
",2019-03-25 00:00:00,8,"The Wailing is a horror/drama movie which keep you alert till the final second. In the beginning of this movie a formidable demonic power devastates the unsuspicious residents of a village and it threatens soon to strike in the home of the family of protagonists.
The demon consumes the souls of the villagers and literary reap one after another like a harvester the ripe wheat. Any defenses seem to be hopeless and the police can't do nothing but updating its record. Here the director's satirical disposition creates such an amusing picture of the police department that in the middle of all this burst of violence, it functions as a calming respite. As it seems it consists a common motif in Korean cinema, because we have seen it before in Memories of Murder of Joon-ho Bong. It's an approach that purposefully misdirect us from the looming threat and also implys that the form of evil we are facing will not be defeated by pure force.
The narration of the movie follows the slow pace with which the main character and police investigator tries to solve the mystery of violent deaths. There is a main suspect (the Japanese man) who the policemen are late to interrogate although the locals point toward him. And when they investigate his lodge and find strong evidences against him they fail to proceed the case further, giving him the time to hide anything that would incriminate him. It's a novice approach on their part but it doesn't damage the movie because it passes to us a malicious and evil picture of the Japanese stranger.When the demonic force inflicts the protagonist's daughter our hero has to give a personal fight to earn her back not as an officer but as a father. And when the family decides to bring a shaman to exorcise the demon, he appears as a silver lining in the cloud. The rituals that take place later are not only interesting as a cinematographic image but serve also as dramaturgic process with tense and high emotions.
The second ritual provokes a counter-ritual by the Japanese man/demon and the director films it as a critical confrontation full chants and meaningful body language. It's a stage of a spiritual battle with theatrical interplay and climactic suspense. Both the shaman and the Japanese excel as spiritual, out of this world actors, who in a few minutes of ritualistic practice open to us a window to the ancient world beyond. The sequence is amongst the highlights of the movie.
But just when we thought we had figured out who is the good and bad in this movie the scenario gets perplexed with the presence of a young woman. She seems to be able to exert power over the two shamans and suddenly our understanding for the movie is shaking. If she is the demon, then we were looking at the wrong spot the hole movie. But what if she's not and her intentions are to help the little girl?
Uncertainty reigns as we don't know if we are misguided or illuminated by the words of the actors. A crack towards the truth opens in the last sequences of the movie but for me it is just too stretched. One twist in the myth was enough to thrill me, a second one that subverts the first is pushed a bit far. However we talk about an overall exciting movie."
" is a wonder the 15 certificate held
",2019-02-25 00:00:00,8,"A truly astonishing film that constantly surprises and confounds throughout its considerable length. Yes, it has to be admitted it is too long. This is not a problem whilst watching because one becomes transfixed by the all and sundry goings on but towards the end and the false endings start to kick in the time that has passed becomes evident. reducing the length would not seem difficult because there is a certain wastage and duplication in the first act. Indeed, in common with other Korean and Hong Kong films the attempts at humour seem not to work in the West. Too much tomfoolery and slapstick in all the seeming wrong places. Anyway, the main thrust of the film, taking place as it does in parts of Korea I have never seen depicted in film before, with little semi derelict shacks and undergrowth impinging, is really creepy and not a little worrying. The business with the shaman, the chickens, goat, swords and fire would have been bad enough but with the sad child being exorcised, in such evident pain, it is a wonder the 15 certificate held. A difficult but eyeopening and worthwhile look at the underside of the more primitive side of Korea with great landscape shots along the way."
" Too mysterious to be loveable
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,7,"The Wailing is quite a movie due to many Internet lists about best K-Horror, begin to insert the title among the classic ones like A Tale of Two Sisters and Whispering Corridors series. While I didn't quite taste the amazingness after watch the movie, the analysis around my head after few days justify the lack of ending.Focus on a village that attacked by mysterious plague; when people suddenly turns crazy and murder his/her family, a police investigates the case while his daughter is slowly corrupted by the plague.My first salutation is given to the main character, the police. He is unlike what we encounter in a horror or any movies that have the zero to hero movement (or stays zero), but this MC (main character) has his own violent and fragile sides that happen in the movie interchangeably. This is usually a character that die first in zombie or slasher movies, but it's until you realize that the police is us, after all. While the presentation feels comedic at the first place, it evolves when the situation becomes more complex.The story is quite intriguing first, because there are many hints and clues you can perceive in many ways. I think this is the strongest point and also the weakest, because each time the mysterious bar arises, the story begins to give more question. Sure, for those who can interpret those hints easily, it's a nice ride, but to be the audience who wandering so many why, the unresolved questions buffer the climax and ending scene excitement.While the narration gives an impression of your standard horror movie, many articles/threads in the net conclude this movie is full of hidden meanings, hence make you more interested. If those meanings were intended by the writer, sure it's works, but I think to staple the symbols into quite a realistic narration, it's difficult to appreciate the movie more.I think it's appropriate to call Mother! which included in my Perfect 10 list, as a comparison. Mother! leaves us in unworldly scenes that make the symbols vivid, as opposed to The Wailing with odd ending and rather unfitting to the nature of the movie. It's probably best if you watch it twice to get all details.For those who loves a Korean horror film with hidden details and lots of mystery, I feel The Wailing can be one of the best choices. I hope I can have a moment that urges me to watch it someday, so that I can taste the mystery better, although my final score stays the same."
" entertaining but a bit silly
",2019-02-01 00:00:00,6,"Overall i enjoyed watching this movie, however, i thought it could have been much better. Some of the characters decisions and actions they take are just nonsense and unrealistic. I shook my head at some of the idiotic scenes that were just over-the-top and too dramatic. That being said, the movie is worth a watch."
" ear-shattering, nerve-racking, mind-blowing terror
",2019-01-29 00:00:00,7,"The Wailing, is a boisterous clamor of adrenaline and tension, melding different styles of horror together to provide an altogether unique experience. Part infection, part possession horror- this is one of the finest horror films of the year. It melds religion and mysticism with horror to create a paralyzing intensity unlike anything else. One of the most insane theatrical experiences of the year- a torturous delve into hell unleashed on earth."
" Excellent slow-burn horror.
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,8,"A slow burn of a horror film, this shares many of the characteristic of Hereditary (2018) not least from being a damn fine film. Like the latter, the film takes its time to build up a palpable sense of dread, but also explore the normality and mundanity of its characters and location, mining a lot of humour and goodwill from its central flawed character who only wishes to protect his family. It's also expertly crafted with beautiful cinematography and a haunting soundtrack. But the tension lies in the film keeping its audience firmly in the same mindset of its hero, completely unsure throughout of where the film is going and what the truth is, right up until a final moments. Great stuff!"

" Decent, but Could Be Better
",2018-12-15 00:00:00,7,"Let me start offy saying I did like this movie, I just think it lost momentum and suspense in parts and that took away from its mystery. It started off great - viewers don't really know what's causing this ailment (is it the Japsnese guy or is that just superstition? Is it that weird fungus the cop finds at the first victim's house?). The dreams of the Japanese guy with red eyes is also cool. Again - you could chalk it up to a smal town's fear of foreigners. But then as it progresses, it turns out it IS the Japanese guy, and the main guy spends loads of money on a shamanic ritual to save his daughter, which appears to be working, until he cuts it off halfway thru cuz his daughters freaking out. Here I started to get a bit bored. The plot shifts to just plain superstition and it's no longer about the mystery of finding out the root of the true evil. Let me also say there's a lot of scenes of the cops being hysterical and screaming. I get you're scared, but you're supposed to be the order in this town.In the apparent crescendo of the film, cops go get the (now injured from the ritual) Japanese guy. He gets away... apparently overhearing the man crying about his daughter (you're led to believe he actually feels remorse here), and then is mundanely killed by either accidentally or on purposely running in front of the cop guys truck. Daughter gets better, hallelujah everything appears saved. Pretty anticlimactic after the very mysterious, supernatural beginning.Luckily, here it gets better again. Turns out Japanese man is NOT the cause, he was helping, and it's the mystery woman you suspected was helping earlier in the film that's the real evil. The real denouement ends up being quite good, in the plot twist at the end. So overall, good film. Just loses a bit of its suspense in the middle. Some minor changes could've kept the tension and mystery up throughout.Still great production and effects and overall high-value film. Just wish it added a little MORE scare factor or mystery to give it a 9 or 10."
" Wonderful
",2018-11-24 00:00:00,9,This was a brilliant film and a joy to watch. It was 3 hours long but I enjoyed this folm. Great over all everything and worth reading the sub title's
" Never Trust the Devil
",2018-11-14 00:00:00,9,"The big question this movie asks is who do we trust? And not only that, but who can we trust who tell us who to trust. That might sound complicated, but it's really not. Watch this movie to find the answer. It's pure entertainment. A thrill ride."
" An overlong mixed bag of stuff.
",2018-10-24 00:00:00,4,"Some things about this movie are very good. Some are very bad. Some are just mediocre. Throwing together a bunch of genres and a bunch of themes and spreading them over two and a half hours doesn't make a good movie. It makes a sort of decent but not worth 2.5-hour film.It's unfortunate that all the extra stuff thrown on top of the core of the film got in the way, because what was at the core could have been really interesting if it had been developed. Unfortunately the core is undercooked and unsatisfying."
" Terrfying horror from deep inside of the brain
",2018-10-17 00:00:00,9,"Except for the open ending this unique flim is full of tense and horror in a genuine way. Watching Korean Exorcism is culturally thrilling indeed. Those who are not familiar with Asian culture might be shocked.
The story can be interpreted in many different ways, which has good and bad aspect at the same time. Some of the stories are appropriation from the Bibles. For example, testing John's beleif of Jesus with the story of rooster's crying at the dawn. For the viewers of Western culture can find some analogy from this very Korean story set. 
Even the title of the movie, Gok-seong, the name of the village which is a homonym of ""wailing"" in Korean word. Ambiguity might be the main theme that the director is intending."
" The people who gave this more than a 2/10 are wicked
",2018-10-14 00:00:00,3,"Are you serious??? Is one of the worst Korean film i have ever saw!!!! I love Korean movies, don't matter what genre. But this film is slow, has poor acting, lack of coherence in history. Is ridiculous. PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS THING! 
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"
" WOW....JUST WOW
",2018-10-10 00:00:00,9,I haven't been this invested in a movie in a long time. I was literally fighting to stay awake last night to finish this movie. Its a unique horror mystery that will have you at the edge of your seat till the end. It def left a mark on me so much that i couldn't sleep well.
" Animal cruelty
",2018-10-09 00:00:00,1,"These Koreans really have no respect for animals. I've lost count of the animals killed for this stupid film. Appalling, disgusting, disgraceful. Is it really necessary to kill animals for entertainment? Shocking."
" A Must Watch for Horror Fans
",2018-09-21 00:00:00,9,Not a typical horror template. Unique and will make you chill to bone. Focus the story and find out the masterpiece.
" a must watch horror thriller movie
",2018-09-20 00:00:00,9,A very interesting movie. the start may seem a bit slow but soon the movie becomes very interesting..the actors are superb.. movie atmosphere also very unique..the movie is unique and it will remain a reference in horror movie..
" It's an art.
",2018-09-20 00:00:00,9,We rarely get to see this kind of movies. It doesn't actually seems a horror movie. I found it more in thriller/mystery genre. But its little bit scary. Worth my time and money.
" Very distracted plot
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,3,There were too many things going on with esoteric symbolism that was impossible to keep track of. So much so that I think the writer has adhd.
" Creepy!
",2018-08-01 00:00:00,9,"This is another fantastic horror movie from South Korean. Totally creepy! This movie takes place in a small town/village, when a murder takes place. A relative kills his family. Is the murderer sick, on drugs, or something more sinister? Is this a version of voodoo? There are so many questions and as you watch the film, so many weird things are going on. You'll never guess the end......and I'm not telling! This movie gave me chills! Definitely worth your time. 
This movie is in Korean, but you get past the subtitles quickly once you get into the movie, which doesn't take long."
" Worth a watch just for the ending
",2018-07-31 00:00:00,9,"A good movie but it is not a great movie. This movie would have been a 10/10 if it was a little shorter. 2 hours and 30 minutes is really pushing it. They could and should have cut off some of the talking scenes and ""comedic"" scenes and make this movie just 2 hours. It would have been perfect. This movie is slightly uneven because it is very dark and serious, but then there would be weird comedic scenes such a a group of villagers beating up a zombie-like person ""Shaun of The Dead"" style. This scene goes on and on. This movie has an amazing ending though, and it is very bleak. It deals with Satan, Angels, discrimination, and morality. There is no light in this movie. This movie starts off in darkness and ends in total darkness."
" This is what horror is supposed to be.
",2018-07-31 00:00:00,9,"A slow but creepy build up. Many moments that leave the characters and audience both wondering just what is real. A good mix of suspense and jump scares that aren't overdone or cheesy. And an ending that leaves you with answers and just the right questions.Overall Gok-seong (The Wailing in the west) was a gripping ghost story that delivered quality from start to finish. The characters were authentic and believable, not to mention relatable. The scares were on point, with a healthy mix of the subtle and the in your face. And the story was fleshed out and perfectly presented.This is one movie that will leave you sleeping with the lights on."
" Something feel scary but u cant explained
",2018-07-22 00:00:00,10,"Trust me u must watch this movie before u die, highly recommended"
" Too ambiguous for my taste.
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,3,"I never saw any real explanation for anything that happened. And I never figured out the purpose or motivation of several of the main characters.
 
There was a shaman who never really accomplished anything, a priest who seemed to have no purpose in the show at all, a Japanese man who is the target of blatant racism (this is apparently his only purpose), and a woman who seems to be important at the end but we have no idea why she's important or who she is. There is an implication (or direct accusation) that evil is targeting this one man because of his sin, but it hits lots of other people before it touches him. 
The end is a total mess - very tense, they do try to keep you on the edge of your seat, but the issue with the unclear characters bothered me too much to really enjoy the movie."
" Chilling
",2018-06-30 00:00:00,8,"The screenplay was amazing, with multiple twists where it keeps us guessing until the last scene. It's a thriller cum horror in one package; many of the scenes gave me the chills. A different type of horror movie and definitely worth a watch."
" A Fantastic, creepy, engaging horror film that doesn't outstay its welcome
",2018-06-28 00:00:00,10,"The biggest strength the Wailing has is how deeply entrenched the story is in the setting. This film would not work in any other setting, because the story needs a town in South Korea to work, as the entire plot relies on South Korea's culture and history.The story begins as a police drama mystery, with our protagonist, Jong Goo, a bumbling, clumsy police officer and family man, who is confronted by a sudden increase in violence and murder in the town, which is seemingly linked to the arrival of a mysterious Japanese man. But as the film progresses, the story transforms into a supernatural horror film that is deeply entrenched in both Buddhist and Christian ideas of demons and the supernatural. When Jong Goo's daughter gets sick with what he believes to be a sickness linked to the supernatural, Jong enlists the help of both a Catholic deacon and a local Shaman to help him figure out what is going on, and how he can stop it.The horror aspects of the film truly shine out, with a next-to zero percent reliance on jump scares, the creepiness of the film comes through in slow pans, confronting gory scenes, closeups of things that aren't quite what they seem, and a sense of dread that builds consistently over the 2 1/2 hour running time.Right up to the end credits is a guessing game of who is responsible for the occurances of the film, and when the truth is finally revealed, it ties the entire film together. What once seemed contradictory now makes sense within the context of the full film.In conclusion, if you want something that will hold your attention for 2 1/2 hours, this film is a fantastic use of your time, and will keep you engaged for the full run time."
" Somewhere in the middle
",2018-06-18 00:00:00,5,"Watching ""The Wailing"" is quite an undertaking. With a runtime of almost 3 hours this Korean Horror-Triller is a shear beast. Unfortunately I feel like pretty much more than half the runtime should have been cut. ""The Wailing"" circles around in a seemingly endless ""who done it"" or, to be more precise, ""who is it"" and even though the acting of our lead Do-won Kwak was not too bad, the dialogues bothered me constantly. I find myself repeating this for about every Asian movie and I assume it must be a cultural thing. I mostly find the talk so generic and pointless, that you could reduce some movies to 5-10 important lines and let them be quiet for the entire rest of the runtime. And this movie is no different. The best acting performance was delivered by Jun Kunimura, who not only presented a great play with mimic, but also refused to talk much (I bet he knew I would appreciate that). The cinematography was pretty good and I liked the realistic appearing gore effects. Not so much on the ""possessed zombies"" but therefore on the crime scenes and such. With that many pro's and con's ""The Wailing"" ends up somewhere in the middle and can therefore be labeled average."
" Not as good as I was meant to believe.
",2018-06-17 00:00:00,5,"This possession tale is told very differently and more mysteriously, which becomes increasingly disturbing as we learn more about what is actually happening here. The film was actually really creepy. There's also a lot of hidden agendas so one has to watch carefully and read between the lines. The ending will no doubt leave you a bit confused, as it appears there's been more than one demon all along (or at least an apprentice) but this is not made very clear. A second viewing might solve some of your unanswered questions.I must admit I found Do-won Kwak's acting almost lazy. Maybe this was the story's intention to have him look incompetent, but his character as a policeman was not very credible. The police in general seemed clueless and inexperienced and that was a bit of a drawback for me. When they found all the evidence at the Japanese man's home, they simply left and did not even attempt an arrest or brought him in for questioning. That was just not believable. They also too easily believed gossip instead of evidence, and the whole investigation back story was a lackluster effort, to say the least. In contrast, Hwan-hee Kim was excellent as the possessed girl."
" Dark Folk Horror
",2018-05-14 00:00:00,9,"The Wailing: South Korean Horror involving Demons, a Shaman, strange infections, murders and perhaps Zombies; certainly a lot of biting going on. A Japanese stranger (Jun Kunimura) is living in a shack in the woods in rural South Korea, people say that he eats deer alive and infects people, perhaps both physically and mentally. Is he some sort of Demon? There is also a strange young woman (Chun Woo-hee), is she in fact the source of the area's ills?Villagers begin to act strangely, start murder each other gruesomely, run around biting people, commit arson. A local police sergeant (Kwak Do-won) investigates and puts his own family at risk. His daughter (Kim Hwan-hee) may be possessed or controlled by a Demon. He is persuaded to call in a Shaman (Hwang Jung-min) to perform an exorcism but the Shaman realises that this in itself won't solve the problem, a stronger ritual will be required to finally rid the village of the Demon.Quite a violent film with several brutal murders committed both on and off stage. Also elements of psychological terror are well used throughout the film, in particular the primeval panic evoked by the forest. The ritual itself is explained and illustrated in detail, both the animal sacrifices during it and the cleansing rites necessary beforehand, bringing to mind the film A Dark Song. This is South Korean Folk Horror.Directed and written by Na Hong-jin this is a demanding film which you will not easily put out of your mind. At 156 minutes however it does drag in places and would have benefited from 20 minutes being judiciously cut from the running time. 8.5/10. On Netflix."
" Awful
",2018-05-12 00:00:00,1,I cannot believe all the positive reviews. This was worse than watching paint dry. Actually watching a awful rerun of Ronda Shearer's Up All Night with a equally awful Linnea Quigley-Brinke Stevens double feature would have been far less painful
" Horror on the Surface, Satire Underneath
",2018-03-16 00:00:00,10,"The Wailing may look like a generic and light-hearted horror movie on the surface. However, by delving deeper into the story's plot, evidences of satire that is related to the second World War and the Japanese invasion of Korea can be seen clearly. At the center of the satire, is the Japanese man who represents the war era Japan that had invaded Korea, resulting in the death of many men, women, and children and the emergence of ""comfort Women"" which was in reality the prostitution of young women and even girls. For instance, the young woman in white may represent the Comfort Women. There is even a a scene in which the Japanese man chases the woman in the jungle. And in another scene, he attacks another woman in an attempt to rape her. There are also other traces of rape and sexual abuse in women. For example, most women seem to have contracted a disease that is somewhat similar to that of an STD that has also transferred into men. And the policeman's daughter's thighs are bruised. Later, she also confesses that she has met the Japanese man. Moreover,the Japanese man's cleansing practice in the waterfall may represent Japan's attempt to cleanse its past, but to no avail. The whole village and maybe even the policeman stands for Korea, and the people are the nation. Nobody trusts the Japanese man, nobody likes him, but no matter how hard they try, they fail to drive him out of the village; he is there to stay and to make sure that everyone is consumed. One by one, the families fall victim to the Japanese man (or the Devil) who fall upon them like a disease. The disease then spreads until it consumes the whole village. Finally, the Shaman is a representation of traitors that allowed Japan to take over the country for their own personal profit. All in all, the movie has skillfully illustrated the horrors of the war, and the feeling of helplessness and darkness that takes over a country during such a period."
" Way better than you might expect
",2018-02-16 00:00:00,9,"The Wailing (Gok-seung)
I've had a lot of time on my hands of late. Stuck in bed mostly, I've been watching a lot of TV and a lot of movies. Some of it good. Some of it bad. And a bit of it surprising.
The Korean film Gok-seung, The Wailing, was one of those surprising things for me. It's one of those types of movies that I think we should be talking about a lot more than we generally do. It's so easy to talk about the big budget main stream films. So many of us, though, tend to overlook the smaller budget films, particularly from markets that we don't pay very much attention to when it comes to movies. 
Some Japanese films have captured mainstream attention, from the wonderful Akira Kurosawa films of the past, shlocky monster movies like Godzilla, Manga, Anime and Animation works, and horror movies like The Ring. Too many of those movies got badly remade by Hollywood, though The Magnificent Seven, For a Few Dollars More and even Star Wars managed to take Kurosawa's work and make pretty good movies out of them.
This has also been true of some Northern European films and television series, particularly Sweden, though they too have a long history of ""art film"" prestige, and an unfortunate history of bad or just less powerful Hollywood remakes.
But smaller, lesser known markets, like Korea, or Iran and so many other countries with burgeoning film industries, too often get overlooked. And movies that do not qualify as ""art film"" get even more overlooked, probably because they do not appeal to our inner snobs and do not make for good ""Look how smart and cultured I am."" types of references.
South Korea has in fact been making its own interesting horror and science fiction films for a while now. This undoubtedly has a similar source of inspiration as the American science fiction films and Japanese monster movies of the 50s and 60s: an intimate relationship and natural paranoia about the possibility of very real annihilation, of a hidden enemy that might very well actually exist, in this case due to the proximity to the unstable North Korean government. This has led to a very similar type of undertone that made movies like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Thing or Godzilla much better than they should have been.
Gok-seung, The Wailing is a great example of just this type of movie.
On the surface it starts out seeming like another zombie/possession movie, though with a surprising mix of comic characterization mixed in. The lead character is an overweight, mildly incompetent, and not at all heroic cop in a small mountain village where some odd, possibly supernatural deaths take place. Do-won Kwak, as Jong-goo is not exactly what you would picture as a leading man. But his pock marked fleshy face is both wonderfully expressive when he needs it to be and a blank almost mindless mask at other times, calling to mind the wonderful Japanese/Korean actor and director Takeshi Kitano, particularly in the way that he relates to the world around him and his fellow human beings. 
Except for his daughter Hyo-jin, played wonderfully by Hwan-hee Kim. She is the polar opposite of her father. She is sweet, full of life and of a surprising level of mature honesty and wisdom. Jong-goo clearly adores his daughter. When he is in her presence he melts. He emanates a deep uncynical fatherly love. He is a different human being when he is with her. 
So we know of course that Hyo-jin will play a major role, but we don't exactly how, and we definitely do not know how interesting the course that the movie will take, because at first it seems like such an obvious genre film.
It's not.
Even when the story begins to unfold, and we think we know what the movie is about, it manages to surprise. And like those great movies of the 50s and 60s, Gok-seung has a surprisingly deep undertow, reflecting those American science fiction films in the way that the characters must struggle with the question of how exactly we can tell the difference between good and evil.
It's also refreshing to see characters freak out when faced with the weird and the supernatural. If we're being completely honest about of it, how many of us would end up squealing and curled up in a ball if we were actually faced with flesh eating ghouls or demons? It's nice for once, and often very funny, to watch people actually do that.
The Wailing could easily pass as just a better than average horror movie, and can easily be appreciated as nothing more than that.
It's funny. It's entertaining. It's pretty creepy at times. And it's pretty shlocky at other times.
But The Wailing, much like its main characters, is also far smarter than it seems to be. 
So, watch it if you like horror movies, if you like comedy, or if you just like to be entertained.
But maybe, when you're done just enjoying Gok-seung, The Wailing, take a brief moment to appreciate how much better a film it was than it seemed to be.
You can find it on Netflix.
Maybe it's not for everyone out there.
But I think more of you are going to like it than you might first think.
You might even be able to brag to your friends a bit that you've found a film that they didn't know anything about. They may not be as impressed as they might be if you had watched a Kurosawa or Bergman film.
But that's okay.
Art isn't always that much fun.
But not everything has to be Art to be very very good.
The Wailing isn't Art.
Not by a long shot.
But it is very good.
And it's fun.
We should be talking more about movies like Gok-seung, The Wailing.
And we should be far less ashamed of having fun.
Because sometimes fun can be smart too."

" The perfect dark journey you want in a horror film
",2017-12-04 00:00:00,10,"A small village is the setting for this terrifying horror movie from South Korea. At well over two hours, it plays with its viewers and weaves clues to a mystery.Another Korean film from the same year, Train to Busan, offered us a father/daughter relationship that touched our hearts. Both are slightly different in their journeys and plot but it is a powerful force that bonds these mean together with their little sweethearts. The evil force that threatens the policeman's daughter here is shifty and hard to understand. It takes the father on a quest of love that promises to harm his physical body and perhaps his soul. Will his daughter be saved? That's the question that keeps coming up.The policeman is the star of this film. There are a few scenes with his that are definitely Oscar worthy. In a horror film you sometimes need a voice of reason to identify with. But what about when that voice you're following starts losing touch with reality? That can be a scary thing.Then, there is this evil force. Who is it? A ghost as the shaman says? This film is not just horror but also a mystery to be guessed at which, if you like mysteries as I do, makes it a lot of fun. This mysterious, sleepy horror mystery tale should not be spoiled. If you have not seen it and these themes interest you, I encourage you to watch it. If you have seen it, I think you'll agree it is one of the more powerful horrors of its year (2016). I hope to connect further through a podcast outlining my thoughts on this film. Stay tuned."
" Thrilling, Sad and Mysterious
",2017-11-28 00:00:00,10,I didn't expect to come here and write that this is the best film I ever watched. It's all about a major trouble that almost faces everyone on Earth.

Greetings to him and to South Korea for providing us such masterpieces from time to time.

" Uniquely terrifying movie
",2017-11-21 00:00:00,9,"Horror is the least preferred genre for me, as most of them revolves around same story lines and forced "" jumpy "" moments, so this is perhaps my very few amongst the horror flicks for which I am motivated to write a small review because of its awesomeness. The tension that builds in this movie is really terrifying and will stick with you for a while. I literally had a nightmare the same night after watching this movie; such was its effect. I think, the emotional struggle of a father and the sheer determination to fight the odds to help his child was captured beautifully. Also, there is a certain intangible weirdness in this movie that makes it really unique, served with some brilliant acting. I recommend everyone to stay away from the spoilers and just watch the movie. It is hell of a ride if you allow yourself submerge into the plot. Another masterpiece from Korean cinema. A must watch for horror fans."
" Shlock-infested South Korean horror import fails to scare or entertain
",2017-11-04 00:00:00,3,"Why do critics often overrate foreign films? Could it be that that there are no frames of reference to effect able comparisons? Such is the case with Na Hong-jin's, The Wailing, a rather dopey ""horror thriller"" set in a rural area of South Korea. If you must see this inane tale, then see it for the nifty cinematography which features plush landscapes of the South Korean countryside.The protagonist here is Jong-goo, a police officer, who dotes on his young daughter, Hyo-jin. One is struck immediately by the crude talk of the local constabulary which Jong-goo belongs, having attained the rank of sergeant. The local police have now been entrusted with investigating a series of deaths due to what initially is believed to be some kind of gruesome infectious disease, leaving bubonic plague-like splotches on the skin, leading to murders committed by sole family members.A mysterious woman informs Jong-goo about an elderly Japanese man, living out in the sticks, who might be a person of interest. A local hunter claims he saw the man almost naked, with glowing red eyes, eating a deer. Jong-goo, along with another officer, perform what appears to be a warrant-less search on the stranger's house while he is away and the partner finds pictures of the infected and murdered victims inside the Japanese man's home (he's so shocked that he doesn't he even tell Jong-goo).No need to go into great detail about what happens next. Suffice it to say that when Hyo-jin becomes infected, Jong- goo attempts to hunt the Japanese man down after putting a posse together including a young Japanese-speaking deacon. They aren't successful in capturing the alleged ""demon,"" and then Jong-goo's mother- in-law recommends employing Il-gwang, a local shaman, who subsequently performs a bizarre ritual designed to remove the spirits inhabiting Hyo- jin's body.Jong-goo finally is forced to play ""will the real demon please stand up,"" and is unable to discern whether the mysterious woman he encountered earlier is being truthful when she denies being the demon and continuing to point the finger at the ""Jap"" (antipathy toward the Japanese still apparently runs high even among modern day South Koreans). The deacon however, ends up confronting the old man who reveals himself to be the actual demon.The ending is decidedly not happy at all when Jong-goo returns home and finds his wife and mother-in-law slaughtered by his now possessed daughter. There is supposed to be some kind of twist when we discover that Il-gwang might be part of the demon club, after we see him returning to his car, unintentionally dropping a box containing photos of the other victims of those possessed.The Wailing disappoints for two major reasons. First there's the protagonist Jong-goo, played by Do-won Kwak. I don't think I've ever seen a police officer as wimpy as the one played by Kwak. The demon appears to wreak havoc upon his psyche and he's end up a blubbering mess —a shell of a man—at film's end. Where was Bruce Willis when you needed him?Second and more important, Na Hong-jin's monster isn't one bit scary or original. All the flesh eating and glowing eyes are things we've seen many times before in these type of films. The only people who end up wailing are those who pay tickets for this paltry and lugubrious entry in the pantheon of shlock (not shock) infested entertainment."

" How many village ghosts does it take to change a light bulb?
",2017-10-11 00:00:00,4,"If you like Asian horror, you probably aren't looking for the equivalent of Abbott & Costello Meet The Spooky Chick With Long Hair. That's close to what Hong-jin Na has done with his half-parody, half-serious take on his supernatural material. He's more serious than not, but he's also fatally hung his tale on a cop protagonist who's a pudgy bumbling wimp. We're meant to see multiplying local horrors as the forge that helps officer Jong-goo man up, if not in the eyes of his bored wife then at least to save his cutie pie kid. He's determined to scream and run for it like a Korean Lou Costello.This prefab spook house is filled with slapstick, zombies, ghosts, plagues, exorcisms and gore, but Na's predictable and it's always obvious where he's going next. He has an OK eye, a plodder's pacing and a manga's paint-by-number characters. His action sequences typically involve the same repeated pratfalls -- he's no Yeon Sang-ho! He does, however, pull out all the stops for a berserk tongue-in-cheek shamanic ritual that's the only memorable sequence in the film."
" A film for those who like their horror films abstract
",2017-10-09 00:00:00,7,"'The Wailing' takes you by the hand and leads you deep into the woods. This is a South Korean horror film that doesn't actually reveal that it is a horror film until it is deep into the wilderness of its story. It melds folklore, cultural superstitions and religious mythology to explore themes of faith and fear, and how ultimate evil can be seen as something akin to a virus that infects and consumes, before moving onto the next host.This is a deeply fascinating mood piece that recalls the brooding atmosphere of Bong Joon-ho's 'Memories of Murder' and the enigmatic mysteries of Michael Haneke's 'Hidden', with spectacular scenery as the backdrop to some gruesome goings-on. What starts off like a pretty standard procedural investigative thriller goes through a remarkable metamorphosis across its (fairly lengthy) runtime. In a nutshell: A bumbling but endearing small town cop begins investigating a series of crimes that point to some kind of homicidal hysteria sweeping through his community, and all roads lead to a mysterious stranger who has taken up residence in the local woodlands. That's all you need to know going in and, to be honest, that's all you really know for sure coming out. The story winds its way through to some pretty unexpected and unsettling places, but spends its first half hour setting-up the foundations of an intriguing mystery while also being surprisingly funny, and it is this quirky humour that lulls the viewer into a false sense of security as a result. The comedy soon dies out and the disquiet sets in, plus the authentic performances from the cast keep it all grounded and lend the whole experience a reality, no matter how bizarre events get.There are answers in the film as to what is happening, why it is happening and who is orchestrating things and to what end, but the film has been intentionally designed to obfuscate any sense of certainty. Even when things are being explained, nothing is explained. Even when it feels like we are witnessing revelation, nothing is revealed. Writer/director Na Hong-jin wants us to work hard in order to drink from the well of deeper meaning. He is indeed exploring the notions of evil as a disease, superstition as a science, and faith as simple perception. In fact, he makes the supernatural somewhat prosaic, which calls into question how we are viewing events and how much of it is real, how much of it is magic, and how much is simply allegory and metaphor for the filmmaker's own spiritual discourse. Either way, whatever it all means, Na Hong-jin expertly unravels the tale at a methodical pace, like bait danging on a hook in the water until we bite and he reels us in with expert timing. But, much like a fish literally out of water, it's a bewildering and confounding experience at the end of the line. I am uncertain if the confusion is partly a symptom of the somewhat muddled plotting or if the ambiguity was perhaps an afterthought (the film apparently was in the editing room for a year and intentionally cut out some context), but it doesn't really matter all that much since the overall experience is so spellbinding.The closing moments, as with many scenes in the film, are both despairingly fatalistic and thought-provoking, and I guarantee almost anyone who watches it will jump on Google at their earliest convenience and type in: 'The Wailing explained'. You'll find theories, ideas, interviews and reviews on there, and gorging yourself on the thoughts of others might help edify your mind, but nothing will comfort your soul once you've looked into the eyes of the devil."
" Too Much of a Good Thing Isn't a Great Thing
",2017-09-18 00:00:00,7,"I was really excited when I finally got to stream this film at home. I adore Korean cinema and find that a lot of their thrillers go beyond the norm. A Tale of Two Sisters made me keep the lights on and Lady Vengeance was as beautiful as it was haunting. This one had a huge promise from the beginning, but the needless amount of ""twists n turns"" made what was aimed to be a movie that relied on atmosphere nuance become a weird game of Clue with evil spirits. It's like if someone had made the perfect dinner then wasn't happy with it so they decide to add more salt: it's excessive at the end, so as a result all of the heavy atmosphere and eeriness in the beginning gets depleted. I would be interested in seeing what Hong-jin Na has in store, but in the meantime I will have a gander at Yellow Sea and The Chaser. Oh yeah, and last I just want to add that the little girl that played Jong-goo's daughter MADE the movie. She gives a stellarly haunting performance and is probably the most impressive I have ever seen a kid on film. Cheers!"
" This movie is painful to watch so far
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,5,"I see a lot of positive reviews for this movie have a hard time understanding why it's so enjoyable. This is now the second time I've tried to sit through watching it and have given up about halfway through. Is it supposed to be a comedy or is all the goofy antics of the main character(s) unintentional? It's like the movie is trying to be serious/heavy but the hero is straight out of Dumb and Dumber. Can someone explain these questions?-Why are these police officers so inept? I've seen volunteer neighborhood watch citizens with more bearing. They're just a bunch of bumbling fools. Like the scene where they investigate the burned up house. All of the police officers just stand around while a woman attacks another officer??? -These are supposed to be police! Why are they hiding under their desk when that woman appears in the doorway to their station??? They act like 10 year olds scared at a boogeyman, not grown adults supposed to enforce the laws. -I'm at the scene where they investigate the house and one of the officers found a room full of evidence. So what happens when the owner comes back? They hang their heads in shame like kids caught with their hand in the cookie jar. Who cares if you broke in, you just basically solved the whole mystery right there. The next scene you see a police car driving down a road and thinking ""It's about time they pulled their heads out of their asses and called for backup."" Nope, of course not. Instead we have a bunch more bumbling idiot Dumb and Dumber detectives. ""What you're saying doesn't make sense?"" Then pull the police car over and figure out what's going on with your partner??? He's obvious in distress, why are we taking this so lightly? Why does every adult male act like a castrated wimp? These are police but act like a bunch of scared children. They obviously can't handle a serious police investigation so why are they placed in charge? What am I missing here? Like I said, I'm about an hour in and this is the furthest I've been able to watch before wanting to rip my hair out. It's like this movie can't figure out what it wants to be.The movie tagline should be: A slapstick comedy about two bumbling and stammering police officers trying to solve a horrific serial killer case. Even a Woody Allen type character has more bearing than these buffoons."
" An interesting horror with squandered potential
",2017-08-07 00:00:00,6,"I watched The Wailing on the back of strong critical response, a rarity for horror films. Unfortunately I was left a little conflicted.The film's premise is a mix of tropes (possession, good vs. evil, religious mythology), and its slow-burn narrative is set in a relatively poor, rural village in South Korea.The tone the movie strikes at first is one of slapstick and black-comedy. The local police are incompetent, unfit and seemingly terrified of everything. I laughed quite a few times throughout. We get little character development; these aren't complicated people. The lead protagonist, Jong-goo, has about as much depth as a petri dish, and - work-shy and cowardly - doesn't inspire much sympathy. Then there's a jarring tonal shift towards seriousness. Seeing Jong-goo distraught over the mystery sickness his daughter is plagued by didn't move me at all, because the goings-on up until that point had been dealt with so flippantly and the characters were painted as comic foils contrasting with the horrific murders. Why would we care about what's happening to these people, when they've been painted as two- dimensional and foolish?The film's final half-an-hour redeemed it somewhat. I'd predicted the twist that the Japanese man was wrongly vilified and was trying to save the village, so when the shaman confirmed it, I was disappointed by how obvious it had been. But then it turned out to be a bluff! Which took me by surprise. He's evil after all. The ending was particularly strong; tragic, but poignant, with some allegorical revelations.The characters make some strange decisions throughout. Why, when Jong-goo discovered the Japanese man had a shrine with photographs of the recent village murders, did he, his colleague and the deacon simply run off? Bring the man in for questioning at least. Get his DNA. Do some actual police work. And why, if the Japanese man was a malevolent being, did he not offer some excuse to put Jong-goo et al off the scent? He made no effort to mislead them (beyond using the shaman), even when there was every opportunity to lie or distract Jong-goo each occasion they confronted him on the top of the mountain. The benevolent ghost Moo-myeong could've made everything clear early on if she'd been less ambiguous - instead she drip-fed pieces of information to Jong-goo, all too late. If she actually wanted to save the village, she could've easily done it. When characters act in improbable or irrational ways in order to confuse the audience so the revelation is a surprise, that's lazy writing in my opinion. To me, this seems like this was just to force ambiguity so we weren't sure who was trustworthy or not, who was 'real' or not.So it's a mixed bag of a movie. The positives are the setting, the basic plot and the pacing. The negatives are the tonal shifts, the shallow characters, some of the writing. There's a gem hidden in there somewhere, I just think it could've shone brighter if handled differently."
" Missed Call from Shaman
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,3,"I had mirrored the bored impassive face of the main character Jong-goo within five minutes of this film starting and thus remained for the next two and half hours. There lies the first issue. Jong-goo is set up as a bumbling, oafish, bored gluttonous cop for the first half hour and in this he carries some comedic merit, we warm to him slightly as a family man just muddling through. When the unscary scariness ensues however, I found I was only left with the two moulds of reaction he'd left me - comedy or impassivity. There was nothing new in this film. We saw tired bloody chinned zombies going for the throat whilst shouting. This was farcically amusing for two seconds then boring then annoying. We saw an Asian child who shouted and cried a lot. Children have been used as scary tropes a million times and this director seemed to be dimly aware of that notion so just put one in hoping it was then scary. It was not. The irritating infant should have just been put in a box to contain it but somehow managed to run the show and kill about three people.Modernity and myth are not comfortable bed fellows and this was exemplified in jarring fashion by a mobile savvy Shaman in this film. We should at least have been jarred by some images of the supernatural but unless you count some pathetic Jim Hensonesque work at the end, this was absent.Criminally overlong and unscary meant my pulse actually slowed as the film progressed. I would have wailed had I had the energy."
" One of the Best Korean Movie
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,8,"The Wailing (Gokseong in Korean) is a 2016 South Korean horror movie directed by Na Hong-Jin. The movie is set in a little village in the mountains of South Korea and it's about a police officer named Jong- Goo (Kwak Do-hon) who investigates a series of mysterious killings and illnesses. At first the police department thinks that killings is just a normal kind of killing, but as time passes and more bodies being found, Jong-goo knows that something is wrong. A mysterious disease starts spreading among the villagers, causing a rash which precedes violent murderous outbreaks followed by stupor and eventually death! When Jong-goo's daughter is also become sick like the others, the main story of the movies begins. He see a girl with white dress in front of one of the victims house that she claims she knows who is responsible for this disease and killing, a Japanese stranger who lives in a cabin in the woods...I highly recommend The Wailing to horror movie fans who liked movies Rosemary's Baby, I Saw the Devil and The Exorcist. It has a combination of those three movies but in a new and strange way in 2016! You always guess one thing gonna happen, but the movie shows that in another way, specially at the end of the movie all of your guesses might be wrong... or maybe right! The actors played very good and Kwak Do-hon nailed it as a father and a policeman.It had only one problem that maybe it's just my problem : Running Time. The movie is 156 minutes, for a horror movie it was really long and the tempo and rhythm of the movie in the middle was slow. Maybe if they did a better editing and cut the non-important parts, it would've became a perfect horror movie in all aspects. Anyway, The Wailing is one of the best horror movies that I watched in a couple years and if you're a fan of this kind of movies, you're gonna love it!"

Writer & director Hong-jin Na, gives a powerful view of the dangers surrounding a world of shamans, evil spells, leaving viewers and protagonist Jong-goo (the policeman) in a maze of ignorance, toward a parallel world, only understood or presumably understood by people with special insights.There is an ongoing debate about the conclusion or understanding of the movie, none of them right or wrong, and that is exactly the point, the film offers a view in a world of mysticism, where events can be reversed or take an unexpected turn. The understanding comes with, how you choose to put these events together, giving them purpose. Here is the way I have chosen to put events together, giving some sort of understanding of this chilling drama. (reading on will spoil the fun,if you haven't seen the movie yet) Moving to the middle of the movie, the shaman Il-gwang wants to cast a deadly hex, (death spell) towards the presumed evil shaman, the Jap. Il-gwang states clearly to Jong-goo, that this evil shaman is a master of evil, and that drinking, having intercourse or anything resembling vulnerable behavior, may disrupt the casted hex and make it backfire. In my opinion, that is exactly the key, making events and spells spiral out of control. The father and policeman Jong-goo, can't watch while his daughter screams in agony, while Il-gwang is performing the hex. Going against the shaman's clear instructions, Jong-goo stops Il-gwang in the middle of casting the hex, and the deadly spell backfires. Not only does the Jap survive the attack, but Il-gwang turns evil, thus the result of the reversing hex. Another side effect on reversing the hex, is that instead of killing, the hex is then sent toward the dead corpse in the car reviving it, setting him of as a bodyguard for the Jap (evil strategic thinking) while he is recovering. Once turning the good shaman Il-gwang to the evil side, the Jap secludes himself from sight, by staging his own death, Jong-goo thinking he has killed the Jap in a truck accident. Il-gwang faces the mysterious woman, who now protects Jong-goo's family, and starts bleeding out the nose and vomiting fiercely, he flees under attack until he reaches the boarders of her powers (when the bug hallucinations stop). Back at the house Jong-goo faces the mysterious woman, who tells him not to go back to the house until the rooster has crowed three times. Il-gwang (now in the devil's league) tells Jong-goo not to trust her over the cellphone. The father and policeman losing faith, (impossible for Jong-goo and us for that matter, to see what is what at this stage) returns to his house before the roosters third crow and finds his wife and mother in law dead. Thus, the protecting spell of the mysterious woman is broken (her use and powers now indifferent) giving Il-gwang the opportunity to return and take the pictures of Jong-goo's slain family.Ultimately the movie offers a puzzle, whether you want to solve it your own way or demanding it be solved for you, before you leave the theater, is a matter of temper. For me personally it was a thrill to be challenged by writer & director Hong-jin Na, giving me a lot to think about (thus giving the movie 10). The best part of this puzzle is that it can be solved in many ways, this was just one of many.M.R."
" Spoilers follow ...
",2017-07-07 00:00:00,8,"Shall I state the obvious? At 156 minutes, 'The Wailing' is very long. If it was split down the middle into two chapters, that would at least allow a breather in between acts. Alright? I've got that off my chest, so we can move on. Because 'The Wailing' is excellent. How is it that this modestly budgeted South Korean horror film, that features only occasional special effects and a cast of actors of varied ages (as opposed to predominantly young and pretty) shows up obscenely financed mainstream Hollywood output as being tired, CGI-reliant and shallow? Perhaps for precisely those reasons.Kwak Do-won is excellent as Jong-goo, a police officer investigating a series of outbreaks of a mysterious wasting disease in and around his village. Various scenes of violently possessed and afflicted characters illustrate this. When the malady appears to affect his daughter Hyo-jinn, he sees the progression of the disease first-hand. Kim Hwan-hee is a revelation as the placid, loving daughter slowly transformed into a shrieking, snarling fiend – afraid of the shaman Il-gwang (Hwang Jung-min) brought in to exorcise her, and snarling accusatory curses at the father who is trying to save her.""When you go fishing, you don't know what you'll catch. 'He's' just fishing "", to slightly misquote the reply to Jong-goo's wearied wonderings as to why his daughter should be afflicted. As to who 'he' is – we have to assume the worst. And yet even her transformation isn't the worst we see.Jun Kunimura plays the morose hermit who may or may not be behind the witchery, and yet when Jong-goo and Il-gwang dispose of him, the shaman feels that they have done away with the wrong person  Evocative and effective use is made of location, and especially the elements. On occasions, the atmosphere looks extremely cold, and when it rains, it comes down in torrents. Director Na Hong-jin conjures up a very convincing sense of violent evil within a small community. My only slight issue with 'The Wailing' is that, after all that time, there is no real ending – which is something I usually don't mind at all, but felt this could perhaps have done with some kind of pay-off. Perhaps a sequel is a possibility  We have time to get to know the characters, watch them grow and share with them their harrowing experiences. Productions like this, when they come along, almost re-write the structure of telling an effective story – so much so that, while over two-and-a-half hours is a long time to concentrate on a film, you certainly aren't in any hurry for it to end."
" The Groaning
",2017-06-20 00:00:00,3,"10-word review: Vastly overappreciated pseudo-horror film with little continuity or technical accomplishment.Long review: The only wailing you'll remember after watching this film is your own cry of irritation having just spent 2 hours and 36 mins following a trek-to-nowhere that could have been edited down to a mere short.It's a common exaggeration to say that a movie has no plot, but in this case it's hard to argue. (Spoiler alert) A small South Korean hamlet is invaded by demons (who double as Minolta film camera enthusiasts -- where do they develop their rolls?) undertaking a wanton campaign to slaughter the villagers one by one. Who are these photographic fiends? Why do they ""shoot to kill""? By what supernatural means do they convert the innocent into bloodthirsty monsters? Such basic questions never disturb the imagination of our filmmaker.Instead, the bulk of the movie concerns the villagers' unreasonable reactions to their increasingly troubling plight: e.g. (1) The police find a wall of photos of the mounting victims in the home of the suspected murderer/demon, yet do nothing when the suspect walks in. (2) Zombies attack the innocent only for their friends to defend the zombies instead. (3) Doctors conclude that mushrooms consumed locally for many years are suddenly at fault for patients molting their skin, losing all higher brain function, and biting anything that moves. Alrighty then.After hours of confusion, the question boils down to whether the devil is an aged Japanese man who lives in the nearby forest. Why this should be the denouement of such an overlong odyssey is anyone's guess, but it's a clear reference to the generalized sentiment that Japanese = devils, probably the most overused and least surprising conceit in all of Korean cinematic history. Best to stick with the tried and true, I guess.Technically, the film is a slop-fest with minimal evidence of editing. I would definitely have resorted to fast-forwarding had I been watching it alone; many scenes were the cinematic equivalent of enduring a simpleton windbag use tortuous explanations for the most insignificant conclusions. In one humorous example of the filmmakers' inattention, the protagonist struggles with a decision to accept or decline a phone call, eventually deciding to decline the call BY PRESSING THE GREEN BUTTON. This sort of inadvertent surrealism sums up the movie for me.So why the decent reviews on this site? That's hard to answer. It seems that a certain number of reviewers are just big Korean film fans, and maybe this attachment impedes their judgment. That said, I'm a Korean film fan myself. If you're interested in an infinitely better Korean horror/crime movie, I'd recommend ""Memories of Murder,"" Bong Joon Ho's tour de force dramatization of the Hwaseong serial murders. Now that's a scary film you won't want to forget."
" Pure Evil Is Manifest.
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,10,"I missed the chance to see it in 2016. I saw the film just recently and I recommend you to see these two superb films: Gui si (a.k.a Silk 2006) and Noroi (a.k.a. The Curse 2005). Also as an afterthought I recommend you see Dark Water (2002 film directed by Hideo Nakata). Hideo Nakata also directed the cult horror films Ring and Ring 2(1998 and 2005). Also recommend you see Ju-On series of films. Now that all said, we move over to this film. It is about a Japanese man has recently arrived at a little village in the mountains of South Korea, living in a secluded house. A mysterious disease starts spreading among the villagers, causing a rash which precedes violent murderous outbreaks followed by stupor and eventually death.Police officer Jong-goo, who is investigating the case, meets a mysterious young woman called Moo-myeong (""no name"" in Korean), who tells him about the Japanese stranger, and later disappears. Watch the film to find out what happens next...Well-known actor Kwak Do-won plays the central character of the film as Jong-goo. Jong-goo does not believe in ghosts the paranormal etc., etc. But as sinister events unfold before his eyes he is forced to seek help from those who are acquainted with the occult. There are no overly spectacular C.G.I. special effects in this film. Special effects are kept to a bare minimum. The atmosphere and psychological horror are what makes this film special. Na Hong-jin who has already directed the cult film The Chaser(2008) and the highly acclaimed drama The Yellow Sea(2010) adds one more superb film to his career. In ending this review, I must say that this film is not a complete film and I hope to see a sequel film in the future.Thanks for reading, may you live long and prosper."
" They can all die its not worth it
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,5,"If only I could reach my hand through my TV screen and kill these idiots myself... esp the main ""good"" guy, what a pathetic weakling. I really hope Korea is not full of fumbling bumbling screaming idiots as portrayed in this film.If you like movies where you are frustrated with how idiotic the characters are and don't really care if they live or die, then this is a great movie for you. Otherwise.. save yourself some time."
" Intense slow-burning slice of Korean horror
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,7,"THE WAILING is the third film in the career of Korean director Na Hong-jin and it's a very different beast to his first two, THE CHASER and THE YELLOW SEA. Both of those are among my favourite films of all times thanks to their breakneck action and intense thrills, whereas THE WAILING is much more old-fashioned, a slow-burning piece of atmospheric horror that's all about the mood and mystique rather than intensity and thrilling action.The film has a rural setting and sees the typically inept Korean police force attempting to make sense of weird deaths and the weird murderers committing them. Before long it becomes clear that an old Japanese hermit, played by yakuza film regular Jun Kunimura, is somehow connected to the deaths. What follows is two-and-a-half hours of sustained horror involving possession, curses, disease, rituals, and even some zombie mayhem. Some viewers might find the slow pace off-putting, but I found this film rewarding right up until the twist-upon-twist climax. It's exceptionally slow and features some stand-out sequences, like the zombie attack and the endless ritual. The performances are neatly-judged and the mystery keeps you guessing right until the end. It's a very interesting film, one made to reward repeat viewing."
" A Supremely Entertaining Tale of the Undead form Korea
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,8,"In the small rural village of Goksung deep in the South Korean countryside things are happening. They are not only going bump in the night, they are being torn to pieces and the perpetrators seem to be members of the victim's families.Then inept but genuine police officer Jong-goo is on the scene (Do-wan Kwak) and he is left bewildered by the savagery of the attacks. Then he hears that a local Japanese man who lives in isolation deep in the woods has something to do with all the nocturnal goings on and he sets out to investigate.What happens next has repercussions for him, his family and the whole village. Now this is 156 minutes long and it does not seem even half of that as it is so riveting and entertaining. The action and plot twist are almost a constant and the acting is brilliant. You do have the usual Korean silly moments of gross ineptitude but they are counterbalanced by the crude, rude and downright messy happenings that are a staple of this film.If you like a zombie flick or an action fest or just a ruddy good story then there will be enough to fill your blood soaked boots – thoroughly recommended."
" The Wailing is Coming From the Audience
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,5,"Wow. After all of the glowing user and critical reviews, what a let down. As others have noted, the first part of this long film has almost a comedic tone before things really get serious. And having lived in S. Korea and having a Korean wife, I understand most of the cultural differences we see as American viewers. For example, as a smaller, much more homogeneous society, with a much lower crime rate, policemen often don't carry guns and see violent crime as an aberration and not just an excuse to crack skulls, lock up everyone in sight and pile on as many charges as possible. Still, after the young girl stabbed the baby sitter, I think she would have been institutionalized for further observation. This move would have removed her from her part in the bloody finale.As for the supernatural back and forth honestly, I have zero supernatural superstitions or beliefs, so the filmmaker must build a strong, logical and coincidental case to get my buy in. This movie doesn't do that, so at the end of the day, it all comes off as pretty silly and yawn inducing--much like a similar American movie which also garnered raves, The Witch. Oh well, at least my wife got a kick out of the colorful Korean dialogue."
" Say what now?
",2017-03-21 00:00:00,6,"To me a great film is one that makes the viewer ask questions that relate not only to the film but ones that can give greater insight into the real world. During this film however I found myself asking questions like ""is this part SUPPOSED to be funny?"" and ""what in the hell is going on?"" For the first half of this overly long film I was actually praising how well the humor was translating for a foreign language film; during the second half all that praise went away. The film seemed to have taken a turn for the serious but there were several scenes where certain elements were so over-the- top ridiculous that they seemed unintentionally comical. The second aspect of this could just be a matter of viewer preference. The audience struggles with figuring out just who is to blame for the evil plaguing the characters in the film until the last few minutes. This, in itself, isn't so much the problem as is the questioning that arises concerning certain scenes from earlier in the film. One of the unintentionally funny (and seriously overly-drawn-out) scenes from earlier in the film seems to have little-to-no purpose once the true villain is revealed. All-in-all it was successfully disturbing horror film but one that seemed to be plagued with the notions that ""more is more"" and, at times, a difficultly in establishing the right tone. Whether or not the elements I found confusing, redundant, etc are really so I can not truly judge until I give this film a re-watch."
" The title says it all
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,2,"Yes, the title does say it all...endless wailing, wailing & more wailing! Like many posters on here, I also read the mostly positive reviews & had high hopes for The Wailing but I really didn't like it. I thought the acting was very poor (including the child. I honestly do not see why so many people thought she was a good actor, all she did was scream, wail, cry & wail some more...& I don't think she did any of those particularly well.) The main character was a terrible actor. I thought it was hilarious how inept & pathetic all the cops were. Someone is attacking one of their friends, what do they do? Basically nothing, of course, except wail, fall down & run away.I didn't like any of the characters, not a one. I guess most of all, I wasn't even remotely scared at any time in this movie. In my mind, the #1 reason for watching a horror movie is to be scared. Based on that alone, I give this a 2. I would've given it a 1 but I did like the cinematography. Oh, did I mention, there was lots of wailing??"
" not everything that moves breathes and talks is alive
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,7,"well, where to begin this film certainly is something else. Directed by the Korean director Hong-jin Na of the chaser and yellow sea fame (check them out guys) and overall this film is an improvement on his previous films. The story is about a rise in murders in a small town where people randomly are going crazy and killing their families so it seems. we follow a police officer who has heard rumours of a link between a Japanese man and the recent outbreaks of murders. While this plot seems simplistic enough it becomes more and more obscure. Some people don't like it on this basis but it's exactly my type of film. what you get is shamen, undead, black magic, possession,""ghosts"" and dead crows of course. The film is quite long clocking in just over 2 hours but it is an easy watch while it is a slow burner it is not to slow and build upon the atmosphere and tension of never quite knowing what is happening. It's not for everyone I'd recommend to those of you into black magic and Chinese horror films."
" A Great Horror Fantasy.
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,8,"The Wailing tells the story of the misfortunes happening in a village after the arrival of a Japanese tourist.In the beginning of the movie, a policeman is sleeping at his home with his family. He receives an urgent call that somebody was died. As he goes to the spot, he was terrified of the gore situation there. The blood shed continues for the coming days too, in a similar pattern. There are rumors that the sickness is spread by the rituals done by the Japanese man. The police officer, with his colleague and a translator, makes a visit to his isolated home in the forest. There he learns the shocking news, that his daughter was the next victim.As the film goes to the climax and probable ending, another confusing part begins. This creates a lot of questions and confusions among the audience. This makes the movie unique and more engaging. The perfect solution can be drawn by the audience. You may need to watch more than twice.One of the best Mysterious Horror films. A must watch. Highly recommended.#KiduMovie"
" A Horror Film Tour De Force.
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,10,I will start off by saying that Korean Films are by far my favorite films and though I haven't seen every single one the ones I have seen have been cemented into memory as Masterpieces. The film is directed by Na Hong-jin and this is the first movie I have seen of his but his third major directed film. The story centers on a village that is being plagued by sickness and running rampant with heinous crimes. The main character who is a cop is trying to find a way to stop what is going on as so to save his daughter. The acting was excellent with Do-Won Kwaki who plays the cop Jong-goo and Hwan-hee Kim playing the daughter Hyo-Jin. They do a great job and so do all of the other cast members. The one thing I have come to love about Foreign films especially Korean ones is how much raw emotion and talent they can portray in a movie with actors I know nothing about and that they can pull you into caring deeply about these people. I also like how the cops aren't Americanized. I mean as someone who is an American citizen the cops are portrayed as militant and bullies to a degree and here they are portrayed as docile being that they have no real weapons and being in a small village and they're not prepared to handle what is going on with the current state of affairs. The action is invigorating. I mean the heart of this 2.5 hour movie is a straight tension filled drama with some very well crafted action scenes but don't come into this movie thinking it's a John Wick or even close. I would say think the movie Seven. The cinematography is gorgeous with each shot being meticulously edited and put onto film. The locale is beautiful and makes you want to re-watch it again just to feast your eyes on it for a second time. I will conclude with saying that this is definitely in my new favorite Top 10 horror films of all time and as someone who is a horror fanatic like myself that is a bold statement. I'm glad I didn't review this movie immediately after watching it but waited about a day because the ending will make you side one of two ways obviously and at first I didn't like it. I waited and read some remarks on google about the ending and came up with my own theory. The movie has an Inception feel to it and I will leave it at that but I can say you don't want to skip this film. I find it to be fresh and tasteful and worth a watch at least once. Don't let not liking to read subtitles waylay your interest. The fundamental theory behind this movie is about a man in a Quandary of a situation but surrounded by religious connotations.
" its so good its confusing!
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,8,"After done watching this movie, I understand nothing but thanks for gustavopac who explain everything for me in the message board. Now I understand every scene that this genius director throwing at us. It took him 5 years to make this movie and its impossible to say that he is just creating some random scene here and there to make his movie interesting. For me, this movie is so confusing, you need to think a lot, no, I mean think hard to understand what is really going on here. I can say that this movie is the only one movie in the world that discover some new sub-genre in horror. I called it a mystic-mind- boggling-horror kind of movie. Its so creative, excellent, sneaky, weird and every word in the world that can define what is mystery is will be suit for this movie. Lately Korean cinema just keep making their same old cliché movie like what they always did in the past, (around 90's to 2010++ where people start recognize their movie that have their own interesting style) and its become so repetitive now. So, I hope this movie will set some par for other filmmaker in Korea & of course from all around the world to make a movie that's even better, or have the kind of similar feel with this one. Now!"
" something different, wild.
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,9,"I try not give any spoilers but some sentences might explain things. I will never ruin your amusement of watching this work of art with my humble comments. but still you have been warned.... the village and the people the way they live where they live, not familiar but not strange at the same time. The cop and the people and the stranger and the girl nobody understands what is happening including us but I guess we suppose not to ... I have enjoyed nearly the %85 of the movie. Some scenes made me think also. It is satisfying to have this kind of simple-but-deep, modern-but-traditional work of art.p.s. try to imagine yourself that your are one of the villagers lives with the family and imagine at the end of every day you go back to your house across the street with fear and questions and survive the other day.only then you might feel the suspense and the fear at your very bones."
" Such a weird movie
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,5,"Its weird I love the cinematography, the vibe, almost everything about this movie except for the over the top, silly acting, its so weird and hard to relate too that I ended up not liking this movie. The main character is obnoxious to a point that I don't really care what happens to him or his family. All of his friends that help him too are hard to watch. The length is a little bit long I thought a lot could be cut out of this movie. Its too bad if it was acted by someone who was half sane this movie would be amazing. I would love to see a American remake of it even if it was set in Korea with a couple really good actors."
" Epic film with minor hiccups
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,7,"I think the most annoying features of the film were the erratic and irrational behaviors of the protagonist, the film's tempo (which often seemed to torque and stall in awkward segments.) The incoherence of the plot was also frustrating (what the hell were the 'zombies' about, why the boils, and how did the cop's nephew find the devil?) with the overdrawn suspense (kind of tying into the weird tempo.) It seemed like they were trying so hard to force in as much superstition to the plot without much explanation that it just became an unbelievable, bizarre smorgasbord of unpredictable but goofy shock. All that aside, I really enjoyed the film and I think it did something new and needed for the genre."
" Korean creepshow...
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,9,"THE WAILING starts off like a creepy police procedural (think MEMORIES OF MURDER), then reveals itself to be a Fright Film of The First Order. It's this low-key, down to earth approach to the subject(s) that makes the movie compelling. It's not only a Who Done It but a WHAT Did It, with echoes of MEMORIES OF MURDER, THE EXORCIST, and many an Asian Fright Film thrown into the mix. At two and a half hours, it may well be TOO involving for most Couch Potatoes, whose attention span(s) these days tend toward the Attention Deficit Disorder variety, thanks in no small part to prolonged exposure to Commercial programs (with their non-stop, constant interruptions, which undermine the Mood the better Fright Films tend toward) and, of course, video games. For Fright Film fans, THE WAILING is another must."
" At first intriguing, then distancing
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,6,"""The Wailing"" is a movie which starts intriguingly, continues as such for about an hour or so, and then lost my interest almost completely. There isn't enough plot, nor enough attention grabbing moments, to keep you interested up until the end, where the whole story may or may not be revealed. I don't know, because I wasn't really paying attention. I'd become frustrated by all the barely noticeable bits of information that weren't really leading anywhere.The story is about a bumbling cop in a South Korean village where people have been going crazy ever since a Japanese man showed up. I was wondering if there was a subtext about inter-Asian race relations, but I don't think so. There is also a ""shaman"" featured in the movie - Korean shamanism is apparently a sizeable minority in the country. This isn't explored in much depth, however.There are a couple of things about ""The Wailing"" that make it really dare to be different. For one thing, it's actually funny. The protagonist is a lazy, bumbling small town cop, who is anything but at home in a world of violence, let alone a world of the supernatural. The movie is not screamingly hilarious, but it has a consistently funny tone.The other thing is the focus of the story. Movies like this generally bring you inside the minds of the protagonists; this one is more interested in capturing the essence of this strange, leafy town.This quality is at first intriguing, but becomes a hindrance as the movie goes on. The focus needed to start to narrow, but never really seems to. The movie keeps you at a distance, and that curtailed my enjoyment somewhat."
" A movie about a buffoon and...
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,6,"*SPOILER ALERT FOR MORONS* I can't rate this high because the movie is overlong for such a simple story, the special effects fall short, and the main character is so irritating. There is a lotof WAILING in the movie for sure, but instead of it being satisfying,you're left with a keen sense of annoyance. I guess the lead should be praised for portraying such an oafish buffoon, but in light of the story (zombies and demonic possession), it tends to grate to the point of masochism.The movie takes itself very seriously, which may cause one to exalt it as something higher than what it is. Ultimately it's a fairly simple demonic possession and zombie movie. There's a subtext that hints to a poor relationship between paganism and monotheism, but it's not explored to any satisfaction.I do like the cinematography - apart from the 'rain on cue', the lush scenery of rural Korea is presented well."
" Absorbing
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,10,"Jong-Goo is a police officer in a remote South Korean village nestled in the mountains. After the arrival of a Japanese immigrant, a series of bizarre murders begin to occur, committed by the various townspeople who seem to be under a zombie-like spell. The situation becomes personal, however, when Jong-Goo's young daughter begins to exhibit symptoms similar to those of the murderers.While Japan has been a majorly recognized force in horror cinema, it wasn't until ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" was released in 2003 that neighboring South Korea was really on the map for international genre fans. ""The Wailing"" is a fine addition to the horror canon, and an unexpected one. The first half of the film is marked by wry dark humor and intelligent dialogue, and is at times so witty, you wonder if you are watching a horror film; that is, until you are reminded by violent and disturbing encroachments. The latter half of the film is remarkably darker in tone and spirit, and feels like a through-and-through horror film. While this shift in tone does leave the film feeling a bit odd in terms of balance, the upshot is that you're likely absorbed enough by the mid-point that you're in it for the long haul anyway. Moody cinematography and atmospheric shots of the desolate mountain landscapes give the film a distinguished ominous sensibility, and there are some fantastically gruesome scenes interspersed throughout that give the greatest of zombie flicks a run for their money. The performances in the film are phenomenal and lend the proceedings further credibility. Do-won Kwak's performance as the troubled father/policeman is raw and realistic, while Hwan-hee Kim's performance as his possessed daughter is unbelievably good—in the ranks of Linda Blair in ""The Exorcist,"" as far as I'm concerned. Some have expressed dissatisfaction with the conclusion, which is somewhat understandable; it does leave room for interpretation, no doubt. That said, I think the primary reason so many have felt let down by it is merely because the film is so long—running over two and a half hours, I think many people are expecting a more explosive payoff, which we don't get (nor do I necessarily think we should). The final act is truly disturbing, and is both visceral and spiritual in equal measure.All in all, I was completely absorbed by the world created in ""The Wailing."" Riddled with tension, it burns slowly from beginning to end, with occasional spurts of grotesque violence, and is rife with religious overtones and themes; the acting makes it all the more engrossing. While it does run a bit long, the film never lost my interest, which is rare. It's not every day that I see a film that is able to both completely absorb me and also maintain consistent intrigue, no less a horror film. 10/10."
" For an Asian movie better then I expected
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,7,"I'm always septic when it is about Asian movies. Because I saw already a lot of bad ones while they got good ratings on IMDb. I guess you just can't discuss taste. But I gave Goksung a shot even though I'm not a big fan of the Korean language. It's like German, it all sounds very aggressive when they speak. Plus the fact that you can't understand a word of what they saying. So the movie must be really good to keep me interested. And with Goksung I had that feeling. Even though it's a long movie I never got bored. Instead I was captivated by the story and the mystery that is hanging throughout the whole movie. Add on that the very good acting of Do-won Kwak as the police officer / father. I don't know any Korean actor by name but I guess he must be one of the better ones over there. So is Goksung worth a watch if you don't like a language that you can't understand at all? Yes, it totally is."
" Viewers should probably be semi versed in South Korean culture to understand this movie
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,6,"This movie is not terrible; it's even intriguing and suspenseful a fair bit of the time.I watched this with my husband who is South Korean (I am not). Being very well versed in South Korean movies I was prepared for a lot of the things critics seem to take umbridge with (i.e. the constant swearing/insulting, almost comic violence, and blatant racism) but even I was left stumped at some parts, especially the end. Semi spoiler alert: much of this movie revolves around the shamanic traditions and practices of rural South Korea. Being familiar with this will help immensely in understanding the plot and possibly the ending. While I was left utterly confused, my husband had followed a plot thread I had not been able to pick up on and was left with a conclusion about the ending I could never have come to on my own. So those critics in a huff over how disappointing the ending was, I think the intended audience (South Korean viewers) probably did not experience this which explains its commercial success. That being said, this is not a movie I would watch again, and I would only recommend it to people who enjoy really artsy, drawn out, ""decide for yourself"" sorts of horror movies (all those people who liked ""The Witch"")."
