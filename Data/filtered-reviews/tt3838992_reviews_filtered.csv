" Wunderbar!
",2021-04-09 00:00:00,10,"Definitely not basic! Completely stupid, inane, and wonderful! Take off eh!"
" Nod to the Past
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,8,"We explore the stars, imagery, and sounds of the past interspersed with some millennial culture. But there is a twist! Yeah, sorry-boooot that.Experience the Ready Player One of media. I would say Kevin Smith likes to share some iconic moments of the past with his friends, family, and fans. It is a fun twist on the ""kids these days"" dialog.I recommend this movie to the 80s child and those who heard the stories from their parents about the media they enjoyed growing up. If anything grabs you, find the reference and explore that part of history!"
" Unwatchable
",2020-12-01 00:00:00,1,At first I gave it a chance... I have seen some bad films in the past and endured them to the end but I honestly could not continue the painful experience that this film put me through for 28min. I did skip forward a few times in hope it might get to the point. I doubt though that anyone involved actually knew what the film was a bout. Confusing and badly executed.... I think one star is fair due to it being unwatchable for me... good luck to anyone that makes it to the end.
" Tasteless
",2020-10-22 00:00:00,1,"I made it into this film less than 5 minutes, including the production companies. The opening garage band song was supposed to be a ""highlight"" at least, if you wanna listen to a couple of teen girls sing a lame song written by ""The Beastie Boys"". What is with Americans disliking Canada in the first place? A couple of characters using ""ah-boot"" would have been okay, but literally every single one of them? You could have dropped it after the first go, ""Sorry ah-boot that""."
" Not that bad heh!
",2020-08-29 00:00:00,5,"I actually enjoyed the film. Don't get me wrong, the film is very silly, has an odd pacing and some scenes stretch for too long. However, if you're in a good mood, in the right mindset or with friends around, you can actually enjoy the movie for what it is. The numerous cameos and the ever moving mole of mr lapointe can make your evening a bit lighter. Not a must see by any means, just an ok plan B."
" Poor Jonny...his career in free fall
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,1,"Best part was at the end, when Canadian anthem was played...only great because it put an end to this rediculous movie...any comedy that involves Nazi's ...well...u Kno...is gonna suck..."
" Didn't completely hate it, but i think is the worst movie by kevin smith
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,4,"I completely love clerks, mallrats, chasing amy and dogma. I truly do, clerks is maybe my favourite movie ever. I think since jersey girl, the only movies i really liked by him were zach and miri and red state - tusk and clerks too are enjoyable.This one...well it's kevin smith being lazy. The plot is kinda weak, like all the characters. The two girls are atually fun to watch sometimes, i don't think they were that bad acting, but the scenes looked more like mini sketches than truly scenes from a movie. It has a comic book vibe all over it, but if comic books were made in a sloppy way. Most of the jokes were not very funny let's be honest, and almost everyone besides the girls and johnny depp had like 2 lines of dialogue or something.I don't know... there's some positives here, i don't think the idea i bad and i actually liked the chemistry between the girls.However the plot and the other characters should have been better developed, and i think it was just kevin smith not caring about that. Anyway, maybe i'm not major disappointed because i wasn't expecting a big thing oit of it. I don't know if mr.srmith will ever make a great movie again, I'm still hopeful. This one is a light comedy with a very shy horror and nonsense tone that i think it had potential, but it wasn't reached at all. Still, and again, i think the two girls are the best of the movie."
" Not that bad
",2020-03-22 00:00:00,6,"I really can't understand all the one star ratings. I guess people just don't have a sense of humor anymore. Yeah, it's a dumb movie, but that a part of the joke. It's supposed to be dumb. That's the whole idea. Stop taking yourselves so seriously, allow yourself to laugh at yourselves. I enjoyed this flick, the girls were cute as heck and Johnny Depp was a hoot."
" I LOVE YOGA HOSERS. Fight me.
",2020-03-21 00:00:00,10,"I don't care, I love this movie. I thought it was ridiculously funny with it's absurd humor, funnier upon a second viewing. I loved the texting girly teens being in an Anthrax cover band and making ""I'm The Man"" damn near better than the original song. I loved the cheesy 90's horror movie vibe, I loved the set design and the Eh-2-Zed uniforms, and I loved very single last performance in this movie. Literally every actor in this movie took their role so seriously and that made it even funnier and so enjoyable. Particularly Justin Long, Johnny Depp, and the yoga hosers. This is unashamedly, unironically, one of my favorite movies. If you are capable of watching a movie just to have fun in this era of all these pseudo-psychological bs movies that take 80 minutes to get to the plot, then maybe you'll like this movie. If not, go watch Pulp Fiction again. But please don't let all the bad reviews discourage you from checking out this gem. It's genuinely fun. I'd recommend it more to young adults who love badass female characters and great rock soundtracks, but regardless it's just fun as hell."
" Kevin Smith got a little too high for this one
",2020-03-21 00:00:00,1,"It's trash. There's nothing more to say. It's cringey, instantly forgettable trash. There you go, saved you your time."
" Sucks
",2020-02-15 00:00:00,5,"This is not a good movie. It has no story and isn't funny. I liked it anyway. Sorry 'boot that.
The two Colleens were fun to watch, and I liked the Canadian setting. I thought I would hate the little Nazi creatures, but they were tolerable. The ending is the worst part--really, the entire final act. I don't know why I was in the mood for this movie or why I didn't hate it, but this seems to happen once in a while. I ignored this movie when it came out because of how crappy it looked, but then one day I just felt like maybe I'd give it a chance. That's aboot it."
" Not that bad
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,6,Interesting take on a spin off of a weird Kevin Smith movie. This movie got a lot of crap for not being Canadian but I don't think that was what Kevin Smith was shooting for. Worth checking out and by far not his worst movie.
" Not Smith's best
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,6,But a solid movie. It's cool seeing the dad's and their daughters work together to create something original and still likeable.
" Extremely well done.
",2020-01-30 00:00:00,9,Extremely well done. Meant to be a gut busting comedy and it is. But a very well known actor gives a masterful performance.In the cozy confines of a convenience store. Violent Nazi sausages have a horrific mission to carry out in this hilarious comedy. That might have a bit of a drawn out ending that is kind of annoying.
" Good movie
",2020-01-25 00:00:00,7,I really enjoyed it. Made me laugh. It's a movie I have watched over and continue to laugh
" ???
",2019-12-25 00:00:00,1,WTF did I just watch? I refuse to include this in films by Kevin Smith...
" This was great in 2019.
",2019-12-05 00:00:00,10,I loved this. I've watched everything kevin smith has made. This was no disappointment. I was in tears at one point. maybe it got a 4.3 because some people have no sense of humor and standards for movies are really high. I'll laugh at anything like the joker 2019. every time joaquin lol so did I. +4twent0 you'll enjoy it just as much as I did. Don't watch the trailer it's better that way.P.S If in NY see WICKED w/4twent. kevin suggested that and it was epic.
" Actually pretty good
",2019-11-06 00:00:00,10,"If you can get past the strange creature going up people's backs then it's actually not a bad movie. The two girls Johnny Depp's daughter Kevin Smith's daughter actually they're pretty good in the movie. You've got some good guest stars that pop up and I don't really understand what all the hate is about.
Of course I'm a Kevin Smith fan, and I like watching actors act and I enjoy Smith's writing. And I enjoyed the acting in this movie I enjoyed the actors having fun and playing. It was entertaining.
I would probably give this movie about a seven stars but I'm giving it 10 stars to offset all the ones stars in the haters that just give it one Stars just because they're d!cks. So yeah Kevin Smith's Yoga Hosers 10 Stars"
" Yikes
",2019-09-11 00:00:00,3,"Yikes is all I can really think of to describe this. I love Kevin Smith, and I'm actually a fan of a lot of the people involved in this. But this was just really, really bad. There is no excuse for this to exist."
" Kevin Smith, what are you trying to say?
",2019-08-27 00:00:00,3,"You can't take this movie seriously, as the story makes no sense at all. It's like a demented/absurd comic book, yet it's not fun. In the end, it seems Kevin Smith is trying to pack another story with tough females triumphing over stupid/inadequate males. Every male in the movie is an idiot, from the band's drummer to the nazi scientist, down to the police inspector. OK, this movie is probably aimed to teen or pre-teen girls, stimulating their riot attitude, but all in all it has a mid-late 90's feeling which can hardly appeal to teen girls in 2016. I wonder if anyone actually liked it."
" ""Aboot""
",2019-07-27 00:00:00,1,"Having the Canadian pronunciation of ""Aboot"" as a running gag got old after it was done once. The ""sorry aboot that"" scene a fraction of the way into the movie made me switch off... very disappointing for this huge fan of Kevin Smith. Stick to what you do best instead of writing bad films to cast your overacting kid in, Kev."
" It's A really Bad one
",2019-07-15 00:00:00,1,"It's A really Bad one , I felt that I Lost my time on such a movie like this"
" I have no idea what I just watched
",2019-04-28 00:00:00,2,"Wow. This is like someone gave Kevin Smith a lobotomy and it worked.
Terrible acting. Terrible writing.
Casting your daughter and Depp's daughter must cloud ones judgement."
" YUCK.
",2019-04-06 00:00:00,1,"Alright. So did you have to have that PopUp Instagram Screen introduce EVERY Goddamn character?! Holy s***. Like constantly hearing the Notifications of a strangers phone.
""Movie"" was absolutely tripe. Like the worst of the worst 90's Porky's remake with characters and a plot that no one cares about.
Avoid, Swerve, Run into a bus if it gets you away from this mess. Yuck."
" I Loved this!
",2019-03-21 00:00:00,9,I love Kevin Smith!!! I saw Yoga Hosers in the theatre and sometimes it's nice to see a movie that requires NO brain power! Johnny Depp did it for me! I love the Guy LaPointe character! I just laugh hearing him talk! I thought it was awesome!
" Should Have Been Straight to Home Video
",2019-02-13 00:00:00,3,"I really expected more from this movie. Having known going in that Smith would be directing his own daughter and her friend; I thought more care would have gone into the script. I was sadly proven wrong.The jokes fall flat with the repeated jabs at the Canadian accent and Canada in general. The premise is pretty dull which I can sit through if the impending payoff at the climax is worth the wait, but it wasn't. It almost seems as the though the villain was an after thought with the main goal being to showcase the two leads. Now this script is bad and I don't even mean so bad it is funny. No this is bad like I honestly feel for the cast, bad. There was only one scene in the whole movie that I can say I didn't cringe and that was when the girls spoke with their principal. Sasheer Zamata was probably the best out of everyone in the movie.This movie gives the feeling that audiences were not supposed to see it. That this was just a fun home movie for the Smith's and Depp's. As I can see that they had a good time making it after watching the director's commentary.I can easily advise people to skip this one as their are zero redeeming qualities... well unless you like seeing an A-list (Depp) celebrity give one of his worst performances."
" The cast was excellent and quite funny movie
",2019-01-28 00:00:00,9,I noticed most of the other self proclaimed critics here gave very low star's to this movie and I wholeheartedly disagree with their opinion. The lead girls were perfect for their role and I had no idea where the movie was going to wind into ..very good movie ..thank you Kevin Smith for being so entertaining !
" What is trully cool in film or in storytelling...
",2019-01-24 00:00:00,10,"See the unexpected, to be enthralled with a seminal idea, and even, even, even if its totally outrageous and ridiculous, what is the coolest is to see if the creative can make somehow, WORK!I think Kevin here, in this project, perhaps before he stepped up to indite the thing or in the throes of it, or after in the second write I don't know, but somewhere along the lines he said to himself, F - it, I'm going to do something I have never done and see where it all goes and at some other point he said to himself, I want to do something no one has ever done and see if I can make it work!And you know what he did! Ask yourself one question, were you or were you not entertained, was it not an original idea, was it congruent and savvy amidst the writing process? I think so there were no holes, it made sense in its very bizarre world, and lets face it, it kept its unit on the film and us! WTF were those lil' things, and then they transformed to become on big ugly thing! I mean I can't say I didn't love every scene - it funny, raunchy and weird and funny, good combo, and you know what the strangest thing was...I think I learnt something... 101, Don't be too much of a Dick in Canadooo, cause its not abooot storytelling, its aboooot wunderbar neo-maxi-zoom-dweebies!"
" Silly, with tongue in cheek.
",2018-12-25 00:00:00,6,"I have seen reviews here bashing the movie. Yoga Hosers is no Godfather. This is obvious. I have been watching Kevin Smith movies for nearly 25 years. Instead, look at the fun the actors are having. This movie stars Johnny Depp, his kids, with Kevin Smiths daughter, Johnny Depp's ex girlfriend and mother of his children, Kevin Smith and wife, Jason Mewes, Stan The Man Lee....all of these people friends. It was done for fun, and to poke fun at Canada and millenial culture. If I had the pull and the money, I'd do it too. Kevin Smith does this, every now and then grabs up his friends and makes something silly, and goes back to making the movies that earn huge amounts of money. Does no one remember the line from Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back? You make the safe film, then you make the art film. And sometimes, you make a film for your friends. That is Kevin Smith. Sometimes he just wants to have fun with his friends. The relationship Kevin Smith has with his daughter is one that every father should dream of having. Or am I the only one moved by seeing Harley Quinn Smith in tears when Kevin Smith gave her the bat used by Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad as a gift? And Depp. It is like he has a side of him that reasonates with Kevin Smith. He plays a lot of roles in movies, but seeing him onscreen during one scene with his daughter and cracking wise that she may not be old enough for what he is talking about was great. The movie is not in my top fifty, but it was nice to see friends and family making jokes and enjoying themselves."
" Kevin Smith...tisk tisk...
",2018-11-14 00:00:00,1,"So, if you want to make of us Canadians how about coming here and talking to one. I've lived and been all over this country and we don't sound like the ignorant dialogue in this movie.
I really appreciate the USA comments sticking up fer us. At least they are aware of their real neighbors from above.
Pull yer head out of yer ass Kevin smith. And talk to some really Canadians."
" The Tale of a True Tortured Artist
",2018-11-04 00:00:00,10,"Although on surface level this film may appear to be nothing more than an unserious flick, however I would argue otherwise. In order to truly grasp the deeper meaning of this fine film one must turn to the tragic background of the main antagonist - longing to become a world-famous artist, Andronicus Arcane finds himself continuously shot down by harsh art critics that fail to understand his vision.Fed up with continually being lambasted, he withdraws into himself, eventually coming to the realization that he wasn't born to merely be a fine artist, but rather a creator of life. He then goes to work creating bratwurst beings pulled from his own DNA that he then freezes along with himself, timed to wake up within a hundred years. However, his plans take an unexpected turn when him and his bratwurst companions are unexpectedly awoken by the two Colleens.Eventually he decides to unveil his newest sculpture to the Colleens, and upon receiving constructive/good feedback he feels as if at last he has made it. He puts his bratwurst creations into the sculpture, directing his children to destroy his haters. However, things take a dark turn quickly when his own creation turns on him and kills him.It's a tale full of unfulfilled dreams, personal anguish, and pathos. It's a modern Greek tragedy - Frankenstein reinterpreted - a story that delves into the depths of man and his relationship to his creations, and how man has the ability to overstep his boundaries and into the realm of God, only to be shot down for his hubris. The film also discusses the topic of life and art - how art imitates life far more than life imitates art, and how art is the giving of oneself over wholly to expression, whether that form of expression be visual or otherwise. One can only achieve a masterpiece when one creates something that is timeless in its truth, and honest in its perspective concerning the human experience. That being said, I must be obliged to give the film a 10/10, as I felt that it has explored the depths of the human soul and experience."
" Yoga Thanosers?
",2018-11-04 00:00:00,10,"This complete twist sequel to Marvel's Infitey Wars with the goal of answering many of the audience's question's after the end of its prequel while simultaneously entertaining and educating viewer's on Canada's history and culture leave those who watch it hungry for more! The characters' frequent references to the past events in the Marvel cineverse (such as referencing how ""nobody lives in Canada (after Thanos snapped)"" shows how a real western culture would respond to events such as these happening.The referencing of calling Guy Lapointe ""Batman"", as well as Adam West's Batman's role in this movie even further cement this movie in the timeline of other Marvel movies, as does the striking similarities between the cryogenic freezing of Andronicus Arcane and that of Captain America, and the fact that this scientific principle is now being used by a bad guy (and by Nazis rather than against them) instead of a good one is a great innovative twist! The implication of the same serum that was used by Captain America being stolen and used instead by Andronicus as well after his splintering from Hydra leaves the viewer pondering the moral quandaries of cryogenic freezing. After all, just like Steve Rodgers is the first true avenger, is not Andronicus the last true Nazi? The parallels between this and not just Infinitty Wars but Captain America'd movie as well speak to this film's quality.Smith's references to Frankenstein's monster made great connections between the metaphysical morality of man, and modern marvel culture and cinematic consistency. This film is a fantastic addition to any avid marvel fan's collection!"
" So nein it's definatly a ten!
",2018-11-04 00:00:00,10,"If you were a fan of marvel's infinity war, you're going to be left speechless by this tasty morsel.Yoga hosers is stunning and brave political commentary in these turbulent and trying times. Bold and unapologetic, which is striking for a film about canada, this film can and should be watched as the shawshank for the millennial generation.If tusk was a perfect metaphor for animal rights activism, Yoga hosers stares unblinkingly into the political climate of modern Canada, diving into the real issues: metaphorical tiny sauerkraut filled brat clones of nazi scientists, and the scourge of art criticism which drives good men to evil.the acting was phenomenal, with Depp again reprising his role as Guy Lapointe, again with the same delicacy and skill expected by such a seasoned talent. The main standout however was Kevin smith, we knew he could direct, but man, what a fantastic actor. The Stan Lee cameo was also the best in any marvel movie thus far, I would explain it, but I don't want to spoil one of the most heart wrenching scenes since Marley and me.The best part, this movie is loosely based on true events, Adrien Arcand being a real person who apparently actually wanted to send Jewish Canadians to the Hudson bay. I had initially thought that this part of the film was a bit far fetched for such a grounded work, however it's just another example of reality being stranger than fiction.don't be sorry about liking this film, it's not the yoga way."
" It's all aboot the sarcasm
",2018-10-14 00:00:00,9,"Never heard of or seen anything about this movie, but was hooked from the start. 
It's a satire that the critics don't get or maybe they just don't like it when they are called out for some of their work. 
Oh well if you want to watch a movie that doesn't make you think to much but want to have a good laugh I highly recommend."
" Load of cow crap
",2018-09-28 00:00:00,1,This is load of cow crap. its worst than that actually.
" Say it ain't so...
",2018-09-16 00:00:00,1,"Wow, Kevin, what happened? This makes Mallrats look like Citizen Kane (for the record I loved Mallrats; at least that was funny). Not one laugh in the entire film. Spent 90 minute trying to make a Canadian joke (and didn't get there)."
" #funmovie
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,10,"Great, just watched on Netflix after searching ""Kevin Smith"". I loved this. Big stars, fun music. Enjoyable! For those of you seeking deeper thought, (take-off, eh), & just watch this later. #superfun."
" Two words for Kevin Smith
",2018-08-21 00:00:00,1,"Grow Up! You are too old to be making naughty teener movies. Maybe there is something to pot affecting your brain, because you had groundbreaking classics in Dogma and Chasing Amy, but this garbage is worse than the indie junk produced by high school kids."
" Shirley and Shirley
",2018-08-08 00:00:00,1,"Because he had no other choice, Kevin Smith started exactly where he was at... the very bottom, financially... for his black and white crass comedy, CLERKS, which had a great script, a gang of real characters playing fictional ones and a location that really put you there for the action and, on purpose, complete lack of...Which was followed by the much too colorful (and hopelessly vacant) MALLRATS that led to Smith's best venture, CHASING AMY and, years later when his indie magic had dried up and after failing at the conventional box office, he intentionally returned to the slacker's den where, along with a podcast show, there's an attempt to make daughter Harley Quinn Smith a star. But not by herself. Along with this every-girl, just comfortable enough in front of the camera, is pixie model Lily-Rose Depp; the daughter of Johnny Depp, who, between million dollar PIRATE successes and a string of artistic misfires, seems to be doing Kevin a return-favor by appearing in both TUSK and the latest, YOGA HOSERS, as a spaced-out, boil-faced, scraggly-haired private eye (of sorts) named Guy Lapointe, a hybrid of Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau, Robert Shaw's Quint from JAWS and Peter Falk's scruffy TV Detective Columbo.The main characters are the two teenage girls, both named Colleen, who, like Dante and Randall in CLERKS, work as... well... clerks at a convenience store; only more liken to a 711 instead of a rural-suburban dive-purgatory...While Smith's two male CLERKS had polar opposite personalities, which is essential in any kind of buddy flick, these girls, staring at their cell phones and, as Canadians, pronouncing, for example, the word ""About"" as ""A-Boot"", are exactly the same...Pop Culture guru Smith, like Quentin Tarantino, is heavily influenced by old stuff... ranging from The Fonz to JAWS... that he grew up on. If only there was more of a LAVERNE & SHIRLEY vibe here... a sit-com where two polar opposite girl roomies continuously kept each other going. Shirley is girl-next-door cute, extremely uptight and on the verge of having a mental breakdown, perpetually guided by the stronger, more experienced party girl, Laverne, who keeps herself out of trouble by keeping her best friend sane. In YOGA HOSERS, Colleen One and Colleen Two are basically clones and hardly even keep each other company. Perhaps the next feature could allow one of the duo to either surpass or digress so there's enough anti-chemistry to make the eventual kinship really mean something.Like with TUSK, which centered on a loser who winds up captive at a madman's manor and then turned into a walrus, Kevin Smith goes so intentionally overboard, it's as if he's giving fans something so bizarre and intentionally-bad to be critic-proof: especially if said critics are uptight party poopers who just ""Don't get it"" to begin with. In HOSERS, the two teen parrots battle a bunch of tiny ""Shatzis"", all played by a computer-animated Kevin Smith, looking manufactured from a student film at a semi-expensive college. The shin high monsters, a cross between the creature Drew Barrymore battled in The General, the third tale in the Stephen King anthology CAT'S EYE, and what probably inspired that episode - Karen Black's famous Zuni Doll from TRILOGY OF TERROR. Herein, the victims all deserve to die, which happens so quickly that, while the girls sit around agreeing on everything that annoys them, it's all just too easy: a maze without corners.Smith new style seems influenced by the chaotic mayhem of SHAUN OF THE DEAD director Edgar Wright, and there are moments to get jovially lost in. But it's Johnny Depp's pointless character who not only ruins a film already heavily marred with banality, but his cadence of speech is paint-drying-torture. Instead of providing necessary exposition, or being a strategic cameo, he rambles on and on: right when things almost begin to roll without him. And not only does he get in the way of whatever story Smith is trying to tell (like in TUSK), he makes it even harder for the audience to get to know the two girls we're supposed to love at this point. But if you want to hear the world's greatest Adam West imitation, standup-comic-relief Ralph Garman steals a ""Lecturing Villain"" scene that's all his own."
" Entertaining albeit obvious 2nd rate Scott Pilgrim ripoff.
",2018-04-28 00:00:00,7,"Worth a Netflix watch if you enjoy randomness, odd cameos, and references from before either of the star actresses were born."
" #keepitinthefamily
",2018-04-16 00:00:00,8,"I was looking at the IMB score and I was completely confused. Did we all watch the same movie? Then I entered reviews to find out what's it all about and now I'm not confused anymore - now I'm pissed! If you've never seen anything from Kevin Smith, or if you did and you did not like it, please, do not even try to watch ""Yoga Hosers"". This film is the second part of ""The True North Trilogy"" (the third part is still not out) and therefore requires that you see ""Tusk"" first. And for a true understanding and complete experience of any Kevin Smith film, it is required that you already saw all of his previous movies. If you did not, you have no right to give negative comments on this one. True, it's not a masterpiece on the level with ""Chasing Amy"" or ""Dogma"", but it's side by side with ""Clerks"" and ""Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back"".""Yoga Hosers"" takes place in the same ""world"" as ""Tusk"", and takes a part of the story and several characters from it. The film mocks the teens today and is full of references to many of Kevin's previous films, as well as a bunch of other stuff from pop culture. Johnny Depp has taken the role in this trilogy because ""Chasing Amy"" and ""Jersey Girl"" are his favorite films, and his daughter is the best friend of Kevin Smith's daughter since kindergarten. And guess who plays the main roles in this movie. If you saw ""Tusk"", perhaps you remember a teenage girls working as saleswomen in ""Eh-2-Zed"". These are Harley Quinn Smith, daughter of Kevin Smith, named after Joker's villain lover from ""Batman"", and Lily-Rose Depp, daughter of Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis (who also appears as a history teacher). There are also Depp's son Jack and Kevin's wife Jennifer, who's Harley's mother both in the movie and real life. Real family movie. There's also Kevin Smith himself, in the role I mustn't mention to avoid spoilers, as well as Adam Brody, Tyler Posey (Kevin is ""Teen Wolf"" fan and character Gordon Greenleaf is written specifically for Tyler), cameo appearance of Stan Lee, and of course Jason Mewes. The story is ""so bad it's good"", completely crazy and over the top, but what essentially makes this film ingenious is a continuous array of references to all sorts of things, that have led me to tears of laughter. So, gentleman haters, it isn't Smith who lost his genius, but you are the ones who got old in the meantime and lost your sense for humor.8/10"
" Nepotistic fun
",2018-04-10 00:00:00,7,"With a 20-year film career, Kevin Smith is entitled to indulge his passion projects. ""Yoga Hosers"" is one such project. A spin off from ""Tusk"" (the first of a proposed True North trilogy), it stars his daughter Harley Quinn Smith, Johnny Depp's daughter Lily-Rose, Smith's wife Jennifer Schwalbach Smith, Depp himself and Depp's ex-wife Vanessa Paradis, even Stan Lee and Jason Mewes have cameos. It's like a parody of the old 'Adam Sandler doesn't make movies anymore, he just invites his celebrity friends to an island and films it' joke.The plot is ridiculous: set in Canada, Harley and Lily-Rose play teenage girls Colleen and Colleen, both obsessed with yoga, gossip magazine ""Them"" and their phones (characters are introduced with Instagram-style text, a bit of a gimmick but it works). The girls team up with Guy Lapointe (a strangely-accented Johnny Depp) to fight Canadian Bratwurst Nazis (played by Smith himself). Seriously, these little guys are the size of a Bratwurst sausage. With ridiculously OTT Canadian accents, clichés (though the end credit version of the Colleens' singing 'O Canada' is pretty good) and a strange Canada-meets-Nazi backstory, this movie's hard to take seriously. It's a world away from Smith's more realistic and foul-mouthed earlier work ""Clerks"", ""Mallrats"" and ""Chasing Amy"".One of the better running jokes is Justin Long's yoga instructor Yogi Bayer constantly being sued by Warner Bros for inappropriate business names.You can take this horror-comedy two ways: either hate it for its stupidity and blatant nepotism or embrace it for its unashamed silliness.It's not a patch on Smith's great earlier work, but it's enjoyable enough."
" weird Kevin Smith
",2018-02-22 00:00:00,6,"Colleen Collette (Lily-Rose Depp) and Colleen McKenzie (Harley Quinn Smith) are the store clerks from Kevin Smith's previous indie Tusk. The Colleens are best friends for most of their 15 and a half years. The sophomores are excited being invited to a 12th grade party until they face miniature Nazi bratwurst soldiers.This has a few fun moments mostly by the clueless phone-obsessed girlie chemistry of the Colleens. The ""About"" can get repetitive. Kevin Smith is making the broadest of Canadian references like naming the high school Terry Fox. Oddly, he tackles a real name from Canadian Nazi past. Like Red State, he doing political satire in very broad strokes which doesn't really work. He goes down some strange paths which is not to everybody's tastes. If anything, the girls work best doing more realistic stuff like getting their phones taken away. The Colleens are wacky enough that they could exist in a more normal story. It's just that Kevin Smith is on weird trip and not everybody will enjoy the ride."
" I can't give this more than one star.
",2018-02-09 00:00:00,1,"If you're going to make an ethnicity-based comedy, which I personally think is still fine and the SJW people can get suck their thumb in a corner, then you should at least put a tiny bit of effort into mimicking the ethnicity properly. Right off the bat, if you're going to put your American own kids in the lead roles, take two days to teach them how to pronounce ""about"" the way Canadians actually pronounce it. It's a little like ""aboat"", but there are some extra nuances you can easily learn to copy. Ethnic comedy only works if the stereotypes are portrayed realistically. You can't do Mickey Rooney in Breakfast at Tiffany's anymore. It just comes off as a lazy gimmick, and let's face it, that's all this was: a very lazy gimmick to get two famous people's kids a foot in the door of Hollywood, nothing more."
" Oddball comedy/teen/horror with Harley Quinn Smith and an outstanding final act
",2017-12-15 00:00:00,8,"RELEASED IN 2016 and written & directed by Kevin Smith, ""Yoga Hosers"" stars Harley Quinn Smith and Lily-Rose Depp as teen besties from Winnipeg who enjoy yoga and work at a convenience store. When the two Sophomores are invited to a Senior party they have to deal with Satanic slashers and, worse, a horrible evil buried beneath the earth hailing from WWII. Johnny Depp is unrecognizable as legendary man-hunter Guy LaPointe while the director plays the diabolical one-foot Bratzis. This quirky comedy/teen/horror flick is a spin-off of 2014's ""Tusk"" with the same cast, but I haven't seen that movie yet. Anyway, curvy cutie Harley Quinn Smith is one of the main highlights of ""Yoga Hosers"" and the camera doesn't fail to accentuate her spunkiness and beauty. (There's no nudity or sleaze, thankfully, and understandably so since Harley is the director's daughter). She was 17 during shooting (or ALMOST 17).Aside from Harley, the first 55 minutes are fairly entertaining, but kinda curious in an ""I'm not sure if I'm gonna like this movie"" way. It's the entire last act where this flick soars with ingenuity and laugh-out-loud scenes. Ralph Garman knocks it out of the ballpark as the mad creator of the Bratzis, Andronicus Arcane. THE FILM RUNS 88 minutes and was shot in Santa Clarita & Los Angeles. ADDITIONAL CAST: Justin Long plays the yogi while Tony Hale plays the father of one of the girls and Natasha Lyonne his babe. GRADE: B+/A-"
" If you are not a millennial teenage girl, then this is not meant for you.
",2017-11-26 00:00:00,6,"I think it's fair to not be too hard on this film because I can see the intent of it, and it's a really nice one.The movie was obviously made by Kevin Smith to give his daughter Harley Quinn Smith and her best friend Lily Rose Depp (who happens to be Johnny Depp's daughter) a bit of experience in acting and the whole process of film making. Some may sneer at that and say it's spoiled Hollywood brats using privilege to get what they want but that's honestly not very fair.Look at it this way, if you had kids would you not move heaven and Earth to give them everything? Would you not use any connections you have to help them follow their dreams? If not then I think you need to question your quality as a parent. Kevin Smith and Johnny Depp, who also stars in the film along with Vanessa Paradis (Lily Rose's Mother) and Jen Smith (Harley's mother), are nothing mote than parents who are working in the business that their children want to enter and so are doing their best to help the with that.Make no mistake though, being on a film set is hard work, learning lines is hard work (Smith is famous for lengthy dialogue) and I guarantee that both girls have been sat down by their fathers and told how hard, cruel and unforgiving this business is before this film went into production and are more than likely being extra hard on them.As for the film itself, well it's not great but then again it's not meant for my demographic (a 40 year old man) as the millennial teen centric theme just didn't click with me at all and I didn't think this was Smith's best work in the writing department either. The two leads are charming enough though with Lily Rose Depp in particular showing some good acting potential (no surprise there) but Harley Quinn Smith is likable and also very good in the film. One must take into account the this is a first time for each girl doing ANY of this and with that in mind it's a strong start. Also bear in mind that most actors worth their salt have made their start in films which have not exactly gotten great reviews.Speaking of reviews, the ones for Yoga Hosers are harsh, but I also guarantee than, like me, a lot of these people will have been around when Clerks was first released and as stated, this film is not for them. With that in mind, I'm sure it will become a firm favourite with girls aged 12-17 all around the world. Maybe something that they will grow out of eventually realise that it's not a great film, but will also be remembered fondly as being good girly fun.It's a shame that given the really good cast the film wasn't up there with Chasing Amy in terms of sheer quality, but this is a fun teenage comedy for fun teenage girls and with that in mind it does just fine. Maybe when the girls are a bit older the content will become a bit more mature.Yoga Hosers isn't a great example of film making, but then again neither was Masters of The Universe, Cyborg or Eliminators - films which, as a young boy I loved and I still love to this day despite their quality. It is however, a shining example of good parenting, and that makes me feel good about the film despite not really enjoying it."
" Even comedies need some realism.
",2017-11-20 00:00:00,3,"Kevin Smith was good filmmaker. He made Clerks on a shoestring budget. He made the wickedly funny Dogma. And he made the surreal Tusk. But somewhere along the lines he seems to have forgotten certain things. While Sophia Coppola wrote a love letter to Japan in ""Lost in Translation"", Kevin Smith seems to have scrawled something on a bar napkin for Canada in ""Yoga Hosers"". It's frankly a wonder why specifically this movie was made.The story itself, is unremarkable. Two girls, played by the daughters of Johnny Depp and Kevin Smith play the two Colleens who wind up in the middle of some really strange stuff dealing with Nazi sausages. Yes that's right, Bratzis. The girls are cute but they're not great actresses. You really need more if you plan on building a career for these two. But that's not the problem. The problem is why specifically is this set in Canada? Put it in the United States and the story would barely change. The only difference is there wouldn't be all those lame Canadian ""jokes"" that people say when trying to be clever.Yes. We get it. Canadians have an accent. They say ""sorry"" differently. They say ""zed"" instead of ""zee"". And nobody, especially in Manitoba, says ""aboot"". Maybe that's an East coast thing but I've spent time in Canada and never heard anybody say it that yes. Sure, it's different than how we say it in the United States but it's not ""aboot"".But literally that's the joke. Canadians talk funny. Ha ha ha. Get it? If not it's okay, it'll only be hammered home with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. If you make the mistake of trying to take a shot every time somebody says ""sorry"" or ""aboot"" you'll be passed out in the first 10 minutes.I'll admit it had some decent moments but overall, it was just terrible. I'm really not looking forward to ""Moose Jaws"" because I honestly think it's just going to be more of the same."
" Wunderbar!
",2017-10-22 00:00:00,7,"More of a 'Tusk' spin-off than a sequel, this second Canada-set horror film from Kevin Smith focuses on the two convenience store clerks from 'Tusk' who find themselves up against teen Satanists and tiny creatures that kill by climbing through human bodies. As a narrative, 'Yoya Hosers' keeps jumping in different directions with certain subplots (the Satanists in particular) deserving of much more screen time, however, Smith knows how to make a zany comedy and the film only gets more interesting as the mythology surrounding the tiny creatures becomes more bizarre and complex. There is also an undeniable wackiness to their chants of ""Wunderbar!"" when exiting their victims and Smith films the clerk girls defeating the critters with lots of energy. The pseudoscience behind the creation of the creatures is incredibly silly though and if the film's low IMDb rating is anything to go by, this is not a film for all tastes. The humour certainly varies in effectiveness; same goes for the attempts to mock the limited cultural awareness of teenagers today and the difficulty of separating teenagers from their phones. The lead actresses are radiant enough though to keep everything chugging along. Some have complained about their casting being nepotistic, but Lily-Rose Depp certainly outclasses her father (Johnny) at least, who is even more over-the-top than he was in 'Tusk'."
" It's not for everyone...
",2017-10-12 00:00:00,7,"I have to say, I really enjoyed this movie. I was entertained. At the end of the day, that's what a film is supposed to do. Is it a well crafted story? No. However, Kevin Smith himself has said this was supposed to be like an 80's B-movie and I think he achieved that. It did what it set out to do. If that's the case, can you really call it a failure? Obviously this film isn't for everyone, but that should be common knowledge with any Kevin Smith movie at this point. If you're up for a campy, ridiculous good time late at night, this is a solid choice."
" This isn't the real world. This is Canada.

(Harley Quinn Smith) are sophomores who work at the Canadian ""Eh-2-Zed"" convenience store where they practice their band in the back room. They take yoga at the strip mall from Yogi Bayer. One night Puppetmaster style Nazi bratwurst invade the store....The film is comedy and not horror. It makes fun of everything Canadian, more so than ""Canadian Bacon."" I originally believed this was made by Canadians making fun of themselves until I saw this was shot in California. Too late. I already laughed. The film also makes sport of our over crazed smart phone teens who love celebrity and everything outside of the real world...also the target audience-whoops. The humor was quirky. I loved ""Pucky Charms"" cereal as well as the girls inability to sing and their gems like, ""Nothing is as bad as Canadian Idol."" Stupid, smart, and fun. This is not for everyone.Guide: No swearing, sex or nudity. Sexual references. You must do a shot every time someone says ""aboot"" and feel free to stop 10 minutes into the film."
" Crappiest Movie I've Never Seen
",2017-06-21 00:00:00,1,"I didn't watch Yoga Hosers, but why would I? Millenial kids (who are already a disgusting, narcissistic, phone-obsessed, apathetic generation), Kevin Smith (who lost whatever potential he had years ago, and (blech) it's set in Canada. Perfect recipe for disaster.Not to mention, the trailer is cringy as heck and the acting is atrocious.Avoid this movie at all costs. I would love to say I lost 88 minutes of my life, but I didn't even put myself through the agony of watching this steaming pile of doggy excrement. AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!"
" An utter waste of time/space/energy
",2017-06-16 00:00:00,1,"Wow. As a previous fan of Kevin Smith, I am completely gobsmacked as to how this was ever created. This was unbearable. The time, the energy and the money put into this production is a complete and utter waste - and everyone associated with it's existence should be ashamed of themselves. How they managed to get such revered actors to be a part of this production is completely incomprehensible. Kevin Smith - it appears as if you're trying to mock current cultural traits but you have failed miserably to get the message across. You were once absolutely awesome - but seem to be on a steady decline. Shame, man. I hope you find your spark again."
" witty Canadian teenage comedy with a touch of German Nazi sausages.
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,8,"I received Yoga Hosers as an Easter gift and I thought at first that it looked really stupid because to me it looked like an Canadian train wreck with tiny German Nazi sausages. I come on IMDb and see that it got an 4.3 out of 10 and then I thought ""ok, this must be really stupid"". But in my opinion, i must tell you that that rating is just messed up. Yoga Hosers was a very, well, whats the word..unique movie directed by the fantastic Kevin Smith. it takes the modern day teenager and adds in its own Canadian flair which makes it one to enjoy. I was also shocked on how many recognizable celebrities were in the movie like Stan Lee, Justin Long, Sasheer Zamata and Natasha Lyonne and their characters made it even more enjoyable. overall, sure this movie did not receive a perfect 10 but i think it deserves at least an 6-8 star review because to me an 4.3 is just plain stupid and they for sure did not watch all the way through. and i still love Yoga Hosers that i have now seen it 2 times."
" Sausage War Party - Wunderbar
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,7,"Going into this expecting something like Clerks would be a disservice. To the film of course, but most importantly to yourself. Just watch this for what it is. A silly movie who does not take anything seriously. You may like or hate the fact that Smith and Depp have their daughters in this. Some actually are obviously annoyed by the fact they got roles just for being related to someone. But then again, they also had a smaller part in Tusk. As the same characters I may add.Whatever your feelings for the casting process is, will determine your feelings towards the movie itself. Also your willingness to be silly and take the jokes for what they are. The effects are also mostly to be taken with a grain of salt. There is not much of a story, not that you suspected any different ..."
" It was definitely... something
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,4,"After viewing this film, to expand on my previous comment of ""does Kevin Smith even care?"", it truly seems like Kevin Smith is throwing hands with the critics and he is going to continue to make what he wants, whether it is necessarily ""good or bad"" in the eyes of the public. His dialogue in this film, specifically delivered by Ralph Garman playing villain Andonicus Arcane, refers to ""critics of art"" saying terrible things about his work. Which can be seen as a parallel to how critics have received Smith's most recent films... Sorry Kevin, I am mostly going to agree with them on this. 'Yoga Hosers' was not entirely a horrible film but it was no where near a good one. Kudos to Kevin's slam at critics though.'Yoga Hosers' had plenty going well for it like its pop-culture references and the ever-standard crude humor. Early on in the film, it seemed to be on the right track to be a cult-classic stud but that steam would quickly run out as the introduction of the Bratzis came to fruition, and that only took about ten minutes or so. I like to think I have a good tolerance for ridiculousness but 'Yoga Hosers' became a bit too much with its concepts and especially effects. Low budget or not, I can only handle so much cringe-worthy moments and be able find myself entertained.However, I can not say 'Yoga Hosers' is a complete abomination and I have not hinted at that in the least bit. Again, Kevin Smith will always have hidden innuendos to his films and I always have found an appreciation of this. Also, I think Lily-Rose Depp and Harley Quinn Smith (Playing the leads Colleen Collette and Colleen McKenzie) were quite charismatic and engaging in their roles. If anything, this film was a presentation of their talents no matter the platform they were given. I hope to see the two young ladies excel in Hollywood in the nearby future. Lastly, as most would know, Kevin Smith has a trademark style of delivering his comedy. I found it hit-and-miss for me but I can not deny that he made me laugh out loud a couple of times throughout my viewing of the film.-- Oberrated.com --"
" This movie is exactly what it wants to be.
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,8,"Anyone who tells you this movie is horrible went into it with expectations of this movie being Clerks, and it never pretended to be. Smith made a movie that you can tell he made for exactly one reason, to have fun making a movie with his daughter, and there is nothing wrong with that. It's a movie that at times is so bad it's good."
" I've definitely seen better... but I've also definitely seen worse.
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,6,"Watched it today. Harley and Lily were charming and did good. I wouldn't mind seeing them in other projects, ones that didn't involve their Dads. It was more odd than funny (or scary). But I didn't hate it.·"
" virtually unwatchable
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,1,"I love most of Kevin Smith's movies and I enjoy his recent stuff that steps outside his norms as he plays with whatever ideas intrigue him but this is the one notable exception. The movie had so much potential and fell so far short of it that the movie is virtually unwatchable. The acting sucks, even notable actors gave crappy performances in this. The fake Canadian accents and dialog had me turn the movie off twice before I was able to finally force myself to sit through the rest of it. Hopefully his next venture isn't as fantastically bad as this one was."
" A solid Gremlins tribute
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,7,"I know a lot of people will hate me for this, but this movie isn't that bad. The lead girls are cute (not to mention hot), the Bratzis (Wunderbar!) along with Ralph Garman steal the show (Depp was OK). Is it perfect? Of course not. Tusk is better than this. Yet, when you ignore the negatives, the atmosphere is very Gremlins like. All in all, Yoga Hosers is in my opinion a solid and enjoyable creature feature tribute.Now my only problem is Moose Jaws. Not because of the concept, but because of the fact that Kevin Smith hasn't said anything about it. I wish him good luck on his next endeavors."
" The Colleens are threatened by Satanic dates and kidnapped by Canadian Nazis
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,5,"The Colleen Coalition are acted by Harley Quinn Smith (yes, Kevin Smith's daughter) and Lily-Rose Depp (Yes, JD's little girl with the gorgeous Vanessa Paradis) in a tongue-in-cheek little movie by Kevin Smith. It's filled with ridiculous visual jokes and repetitive memes at times. However, I rank it in that special category of movies that are so bad, I enjoyed them. Both Depp and Smith family members are cast in this, with fun little cameos by an assortment of character actors. Justin Long as the Colleens' yoga guru, Yogi Bayer shows how capable a comic actor he is. His take on how yoga helps you cope with an uncooperative universe is worth sitting through the movie. If you haven't got a soft spot in your heart for silly Canadian spoofs then this isn't your movie. There's no hidden messages or symbols in the script, the image and the joke are the message."
" Great potential, wasted
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,7,"It started with a great song, has some charming girls as the protagonists and a ton of celebrity actors that came in to bring their support. Some of the jokes are hilarious and the setup was awesome.Imagine this movie starring the Depp and Smith daughters, with their families in tow: Johnny Depp, Vanessa Paradis, Jack Depp, Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes, with support from the likes of Haley Joel Osment, Justin Long, Austin Butler. Stan Lee is in this movie! And it's a Canadian parody with Yoga hosers chicks fighting devil worshipers and Nazis ""the Yoga way"". Wow!And now jump to the film itself which, with this much going for it, barely scratched the average. After the first 30 minutes I was thinking up funny ways of congratulating Kevin Smith for this funny and imaginative movie. After that, though, it all went downhill.I guess the biggest quarrel with the thing is its inconsistency, jumping from great fun to silly and to plain bad and back again in a matter of seconds. Kevin, I love you, but you need to think your scripts through, man!"

" Judge It For What It Is
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,6,"I put this movie off forever. Not because I thought it would be bad, but simply because the story didn't seem like it would appeal to me. I'm going to break down everything into pieces because it seems most people are judging this as a ""Kevin Smith"" movie first and ""just a movie"" second. An artist doesn't have to stick to a niche just because you want them to.The acting: It's definitely passable. Some moments of the girls remind of iCarly, but it's not bad acting by any means. You notice moments when the kids (side characters included) really get into the head of their own characters with subtle movements and vocalizations. The one moment I didn't care for is a scene where Kevin Smith's daughter is talking to her mother, it simply lacks poise. Fix that and it's good.The directing: Kevin Smith is on my honorable mention list when it comes to my favorite directors. When asked, I usually place him somewhere in the top 10 for convenience sake because I watch everything he releases. There are a few things I think he could have shot better, however there is undoubtedly more good than bad. You can definitely tell he had fun with this project - and that alone made me enjoy the ride. He takes chances with angles that really pay off. Then a couple here and there that throw me out of the flow.Special Effects: Green screen played a big part in this film (which is common nowadays of course). To avoid spoilers, this could have been done better. Tracking is off a lot of the time and the effects stand out - though not painfully, but they do stand out.The writing: The God's honest truth is Yoga Hosers could have used one more draft before being shot. The dialog is King, per norm with Kevin Smith, but the story structure doesn't sweep you away like you want it to. It is also, by far, one of the most original movies you're gonna find out there today. That alone may make or break it for you.From a technical aspect, I'd give it a 7/10. From an entertainment aspect, around a 6/10."
" Boring nonsense.
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,2,"I'm giving it 2 stars.One because of Johnny Depp having the bravery to participate in this garbage (father's love earns a star) and Stan ""The Man"" Lee's cameo (Stan Lee always upgrades any movie by one star).That's it.The movie is garbage.You'll never recover the time lost watching it. I know I never will.I'm supposed to write a 10 line review, but even reviewing this movie is a waste of time and web space. I hope the girls find something good in which they can show their talent. My advise to Harley Quinn Smith: Get away from your dad's projects."
" Just Enjoy The Ride!
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,8,"If you go into this movie trying to judge Kevin Smith as a movie maker and direction or editor or whatever, then you're gunna have a bad time. This movie has the feel of something done in a very lighthearted manner. It is more or less a movie made by Johnny Depp and Kevin Smith that is starring their blonde teenage daughters. Take this movie at face value and nothing else and you will enjoy it. I will say, if you enjoy poking fun at Canadians then you will enjoy this movie all the much more. That is essentially the heart of the film. But just enjoy the beauty of the stars, the ridiculous guest appearances, and the music is actually pretty good. It should come as no surprise that this movie leans much more on its unique cast than its ridiculous plot, but this also gives the film a much needed layer of comedy. As in, seeing these famous people in such ridiculous roles (Haley Joel Osment was my favorite). Overall, a fun movie to watch late at night or after a joint or two."
" Best movie on a budget
",2017-01-30 00:00:00,10,"Yoga Hosers is by far the funniest movie I have seen in a while. Based off the title I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was in for a surprise the moment I realized the store was called Eh-2-Zed. As a broke, easily entertained college student this movie was a perfect way to take a break and just laugh. When we realized that the Nazi sausages were called completely we all completely lost it. This movie was so a joy to watch and although people do not like it it can be entertaining to most people. I recommend watching Tusk first, but also don't watch Tusk. Moose Jaws in the next movie in this cinematic universe and it sounds like it'll be good. We're all wondering if it'll be dark comedy like Tusk, comedy like Yoga Hosers, or something completely different."

Unfortunately along his next works, he has never reached the same success again.""Yoga Hosers"" is probably the bottom of his career, with an unfunny and annoying story. His daughter and Johnny Depp's daughter acting are terrible and they only had this chance because of the influence of their fathers with the producers. The name of Johnny Depp is embarrassing and used to lure the viewers. In the end, ""Yoga Haters"" is a means to spend 88 minutes of your life watching a comedy without laughing. My vote is one (awful).Title (Brazil): Not available"
" Sorry Aboot That
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,6,"Sorry that so many people didn't enjoy this movie as much as I did. I love Kevin Smith for bringing his entertaining and fresh (albeit bizarre) vision to a genre that tends to rely heavily on tropes and cliché.Yoga Hosers was more comedy and less horror than Tusk, and while I preferred Tusk for that reason, I can not fault Yoga Hosers for downplaying the gore and body horror and bringing up the laughs. It is stupid humor, it definitely is an acquired taste, but if you go in with an open mind then the movie is definitely worth the watch. Both Colleens are stereotypical teenagers who are obsessed with their phones and social media, but the characters are given just enough endearing qualities and development to make them bearable (and their friendship heartwarming). The movie has a rather star-studded cast and plenty of opportunities for pointing at the screen and saying ""I had no idea they were in this!"" Overall the movie was entertaining to watch, absolutely silly, and filled with A+ puns made off the name Ichabod.What keeps me from giving this a higher score is Johnny Depp's character. He was mostly unwatchable in Tusk and unfortunately he was included in Yoga Hosers even more. While the movie itself is supposed to be pretty ridiculous, Depp's character is just nails on a chalkboard. Scenes that include him heavily will most definitely make you want to turn off the movie. But if you can get through his performance then Yoga Hosers is a good movie to get drunk to with your buddies and enjoy."

With that in mind, I was sort of looking forward to this film. I was well aware that Smith has had a decreasing batting average over the past 20 years, but every so often he pulls out a gem. This is not, at all, one of them.The Instagram (or whatever) mini bios were stupid, there is far too much Johnny Depp, and the celebrity impersonations -- while funny -- goes on for too long. The Satanic subplot was either completely pointless or I missed something. Hopefully if ""Moose Jaws"" gets made, we see a bit of a rebound."
