" Sensible and emotional
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,9,Best emotional movie i have ever seen in recent times.
" Why is this even a movie?!
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,4,"It started well until it became so boring and lame! No motive whatsoever, no background, no thrill, no plot... nothing at all! Even the drama isn't that touching, less than a cliche!This is a waste of time and money. Overrated for nothing."
" Brilliant
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,10,"This film not only touches the viewer but it has a long lasting impact and effects on the viewer about what survivors must endure, long after a terrible ordeal . It's an epic and emotional Rollercoaster. This film should have won every award ever! Hats off to the actors, producers, wardrobe, music, location. Etc. Etc."
" Amazing story and acting but bad directing
",2021-03-08 00:00:00,6,"The plot was really touching and at times painful because of the great acting but unfortunately you don't get real satisfaction because the second half of the movie felt like filling a hole.
Nonetheless, it's presents good psychological themes such as child development, psychopathology, PTSD and simply the notion of the balance between chaos and order like Jordan Peterson would say.
Great lesson but not a good movie."
" If you like slow movies yes, otherwise quite boring and overrated
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,6,"Highly overrated
If you like slow movies might be good."
" Amazing
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,10,"Amazing movie, will never forget about it. Everyone should watch it sometimes in their life. During the movie I felt happiness, stress, anxiety, anger, sadness and so on. One of the best movies i've ever seen."
" No Room for Improvement
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,10,"The best book-to-film adaptation I've ever seen, and based on one of the best books I've ever read, ROOM is flawless in every possible aspect. After her amazing performance in Spectacular Now, her okay but underdeveloped performance in Scott Pilgrim, and her awful performance in Captain Marvel, I was nervous about Brie Larson playing the main character in ROOM because I knew how much effort and power it would take. She more than delivered. She and Tremblay carried the deeply impactful story to perfection. ROOM is in my top 15 favorite films of all time."
" Waited for a twist..
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,3,.. but all that happened was some normal annoying unnecessary family and personal drama when they escaped. Really good acting from. The kid and mom though.
" Amazing movie
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,10,Brings you a full storm of emotions. I would completely watch again and recommend.
" Amazing movie - incredibly real
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,9,"I watched the movie when it fist came out and really liked it. Now, 6 years later I rewatched it and found it even better.
The performances by everyone involved are fantastic.
However, what really makes the film is how real everything is. The mother-son-relationship is great and feels extremely deep, rich, and realistic.
The fact that life after captivity isn't necessarily as fulfilling as it always appeared, and freedom having its own challenges. That was done so extremely well, and I have not seen it done before.
Absolutely fantastic!"
" Entertaining
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,5,"A plausible and harrowing story that is well told, with realistic acting."
" ""Bye Bye Room""
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,9,Room (2015) has to be one of the most heart breaking films I have ever seen.The story is about a woman named Joy (Brie Larson) who has been held captive against her will in a single room for seven years. The only thing that keeps her going is her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) who was born inside the room never once leaving the confines of the small four walled room. Joy does the only thing she can possibly do in her situation. To protect her son from the brutal truth of their life and keep him safe from her abuser who keeps them locked away. Not long after Jack turns five years old. Joy begins to tell him more about the world outside the room. Joy begins to hatch an escape plan with Jack's help in the hopes that they may finally escape the living hell they have suffered for so long.There aren't many films that have made me genuinely feel like crying or have left me feeling upset after watching it. But Room is one of those movies that really pulls at your heartstrings especially if your a parent or have personally been the victim of abuse. I honestly found myself in tears at certain points in the film as I wanted desperately for things to turn out ok for the films characters.Room is superbly written and directed in a way that connects with it's audience in a very real way. Brie Lawson gives an outstanding performance that feels very real and genuine making you feel so much for her character throughout the entire film. Jocob Tremblay also gives an amazing performance especially when you take into consideration both his age and the subject matter.I definitely recommend watching Room (2015) it's one of the best films of 2015. I will say however that the film could be difficult to watch for some people especially considering the subject matter.
" A good story, let down by an slightly unconvincing child
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,7,"Room is bleak. Even after the initial subject matter is concluded, the bleakness does continue.It isn't about the event itself (a man holding a woman and her child captive), but the impact it ultimately has, both for those directly involved, and the people it has impacted elsewhere.Brie Larson is the driving force here: a woman so devolved from her previous self that any sense of normality has been shattered by the psychological trauma of her experience.Unfortunately, something I couldn't help but feel was that the Jack's behaviour made no sense. As a five-year-old who has spent their whole existence captive, his actions, emotional outbursts and general demeanour feel misguided and nonsensical. It is not that the role is portrayed badly - I just think the character wasn't written brilliantly.The standout scene (where Jack lies in the back of a truck looking at the sky) is excellent, beautifully shot with some quality music to boot. From that point on, however, I felt a lack of investment in the story's developments, confused by some of the reactions of the parents and the media surrounding the story.I wanted to enjoy Room, but had it made clear it me early on that that wasn't really part of the deal (and I am fine with that). Regretfully, I didn't feel totally invested either, sucked out of the moment by a child's irrational actions in the first half."
" You probably won't enjoy a second of this but you absolutely must watch it
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,8,Horrifying and heartbreaking in equal measure. The astonishing performances from Larson and Tremblay make you forget this is fiction at times. Arguably one of the greatest child performances of all-time in fact. I was glad that not all the film took place in Room- I'm not sure I could have copied with much more of that.
" Overrated to the MAXXXX
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,7,"This movie is very good and deep, but also soooo overrated. Specifically the performance by the self righteous Bre Larson. She absolutly DID NOT deserve the Oscar for this performance. I feel like the she would have been much more likeable as Captain Marvel if her ego wasn't so over inflated by this lackluster role and her undeserved Oscar win."
" Just beautiful!
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,10,I cried and cried and cried. This Movie is really sad but also beautiful. The acting is brilliant!
" is good film but ... !
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,7,"The movie is very good. Great games, especially the boy in the movie, who I think had the right to win an Oscar, not Brie Larson, because the first role in his film is originally narrated in the language of the boy, but the first role was played by Barry Larson by mistake. The directing was also brilliant. Emotions and drama are well established in the film. My only problem with the video is how the boy escaped from the room, which was performed in a frenzy. In fact, it is impossible for anyone not to see a child who is dead or alive at the insistence of his mother! It was ridiculous, but other than that, the whole movie is great and brilliant. 8/10"
" Speechess
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,10,"""Once upon a time, before I came, you cried and cried and watched TV all day, until you were a zombie. But then I zoomed down from Heaven, through skylight, into Room. And I was kicking you from the inside. Boom boom! And then I shot out onto Rug with my eyes wide open, and you cut the cord and said, 'Hello Jack'.""I left speechless! What a brilliant film this is! Chills still run down through my spine... and I really don't know what to say. I mean - literally I... am... speechless..."
" Hard watch, which makes it a brilliant movie
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,9,"Let's ignore the difficult plot, partly based on Fritzl case (that makes it even more so), for a second and appreciate the acting performances. Both main leads (mother and child) are very compelling in their delivery. However, what stood out to me, was the sound design. There is a LOT of silence throughout the movie, and rightly so.Now, the plot. I was able to simultaneously relate to both mother and child, and found myself in tears on multiple occasions. It is indeed a hard watch, I required two sittings to finish the movie. 10/10 hands down. I have no criticism to offer, for a change."
" Room
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,9,"It shows what is really to be a mother.
It is the heavenly thing. Most imp massage from movie is that child and it's mother are complimentary one is not complete with out the other"
" Never cried that much during a movie.
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,10,This movie is unbelievably beautiful and pure sadness at the same time. It grabs you right by the feelings and I'll promise it can't disappoint you. Feel prepared. Get some tissues. And shed some tears *cries away*
" Liked it in spite of subject ambivalence
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,8,"When the book Room came out I felt some reserve; for a writer to be using the Fritzl story (which it was allegedly based on) for personal profit seemed wrong to me, so I never bought or read it. Then the film was on TV. I watched it with this prejudice but actually thought it was beautifully executed, though (as a parent) the beginning was a bit difficult to watch. The actors did very well.Most of the movie isn't situated in the room but about the aftermathof the ordeal. It's a story about the deep bond between mother and child. Some parts were a bit soapy and long winded, but overall I liked it.I still feel ambivalent, though, given the true story it was inspired on, which part of me feels should be left alone, unless Elisabeth Fritzl ever decides to write or talk about it herself. Watching this made me realize even more what that poor woman must have endured, as the real story is far more harrowing yet, starting with the unfathomable amount of time, 24 years of imprisonment, the perpetrator being her own father, and bearing 7 children (and losing one) of which 3 lived down there with her. The real ""room"" is something way, way beyond any kind of comprehension. I so hope Elisabeth and her kids are okay, wherever they are."
" Emotional experience
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,10,"Great movie, I am almost on the edge of crying while watching the first part. I had to remind myself that it was just a movie. Its a deep experience. All your current problems seem nothing comoared to this. Do not miss it. The kid and mom's acting is simply brillient."
" Unrealistisch
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,3,"Die Frau und das Kind befinden sich in den USA, in einer kleinen Hütte.
Da die Amerikaner ja grundsätzlich alle Häuser und Wende aus Sperrholz und rigipsplatten bauen ist die Frage warum sie da nicht einfach durch haut!

" I wanted to like the Movie - but I'm not okay with this...
",2021-01-12 00:00:00,5,"I will start with the second half of the vovie - the acting was good, so this is why I rated the movie with 5 Stars... But the plot feels flat and yes is also boring (as sometimes mentioned in other reviews)... Not enough for an objective style of telling like it is based on a real case and not entertaining enough to spend another hour... When Joy first entered the house of their parents and the mother said something like ""You know Leo from earlier days, right?"" I hoped so Bad that there is at least a twist in the end like ""I loved your mother since I first met her, I told old Nick to bring you and kill to distroy your family, but he had his own plans""... That would also explain why Robert (the father) stay close to their former Family - because the things Nancy and Robert had to Deal with Family and all emotion... Nevertheless, Robort could return to their Family because he overthink his feelings and rude reaction and has the Chance to rescue his from Leo... But in the end, Leo is just a nice guy... There are (as sometimes mentioned) a lot of subplots, questions and inner feelings that the viewer want to know - but they just end somethere... So the end, when they visit ""The Room"" again and apparently just go back to grandmas house to do whatever and however long, okayyyy... It's nice to see that Jack found a friend before and everything seems more normal... But I think it would be way better, if Jack turned 6 in the End and statt visiting a school - maybe in same class as his new friend - to Show the World moved on and this is a new chepter in life...So, I talked a lot about the second half of the movie - for me, the real problem is the first half...I don't know where to start - the whole escapeplan is based on the fact that Jack exactly do what Joy said, Old Nick totally Do and act like Joy want/hope - are you Sure?!... The whole preise with ""The Room"" has a lack of fear and hopelessness... Like if you Show someone an old fantasymovie and for him there is less magic and mystery today as it was in the 80s - because of the kownledge about certain things... It's more or less the same with ""The Room""... with the difference that it really plays nowadays and you just have to be a thinking human... Compared to ""The Room"" - every Escaperoom (the ones I Was) you spend money for fun, seems like a deathtrap and every ""Saw"" movie seems realistic... The room is in the garden, a simple cabin, no room in the basement of an old factory behind a heavy mechanic door... How long would it take, that everyone who is imprisoned and able to move free around start inspecting the room... And if there aren't cameras or something like this, so there are no signs that you are observed all the time, I would start to make plans how to escape... Even if the room wasn't equiped like this when Joy moved in, there would be something in the room to throw and smash against the sky Light, so you know since the first hour what kind of window it is and could it be possible to destroy it someday to escape (what would even be possible with a Baby)... I'm sure, in the last years she had enough stuff to build something like a stairway to reach the window and smash it... In the case, that the window is some super mega window that is also used in the White House - there is at least one other way to escape... After years of visits, there should be marks on the keypad on the used numbers (old Nick is the only one who used it and he problebly always know the right code - the code itself isn't very long, three to four digits... So she has enough time and nothing to lose... Even if you can't the fitting digits after a long time... You have enough time to find and try out which things in their household make almost marks, so if you arn't aware of it during typing, you will not notice... It would be also possible to wish something for handcraft for their eggshells - like glue and glitterpowder... So the some days later you can show what you made to old Nick an if he touches the egg most likely that he has something on the finges when he uses the pad (I think he isn't that smart)... Everything is better than doing nothing or wait for an risky plan like the hat with the death... I was really upset the first hour auf the movie... And thats not a good Sign... The strangest Thing for me - everything happend in 21th century, Joy is in their district, passed the house of old Nick lives in a cabin in the garden... Normally the police uses mantrailer dogs to find people, even with a decent scent... That wouldn't be that hard... Thats why I am not okay with this movie...Additional: If you are in the same situation an have some knowledge in technics - these kind of Electronic locks on the door you can most likely trick out with a stronger magnet... Due to the fact the whole room is like a giant magnetic board, Joy could wish a bunch magnets for Jacks arts...
Another way to ""cry for help""... Due to the fact Joy and her mother have Smartphones show that Everything happend nowadays... Because I can't see an antenna at the roof of the cabin, I think the TV in the room is connected to cablenetwork... Besides TV, today every Provider delivers Internetservices over cable... Because they haven't the Equipment, they can't send anything, but they are able to disrupt the whole cluster they are connect to (and I don't think old Nick is clever enough to link to with activities in the room... Due to complaints of others in the area, the provider sends a Team with an equipted car to find the source of disruption (thats what providers do worldwide)... And when the find out its from that house, they are looking whats wrong - if necessary with the help of the police...That are all things, why I say the movie isn't thrilling, there is nö real hopelessness..."
" A must watch!!!
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,10,For a film with a low budget and limited locations this was an amazing film. The performance from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay was some of the best you'll see. The fact that half of the film was shot in one room shows how good the acting had to be and the film never got boring. The complex character developments and story telling was incredibly realistic. My favourite part of the film was that they didn't end it once they escaped but showed the effects of this situation on the extra characters. I liked how they didn't end with a happy ending but instead shows a more depressing grim but realistic story.
" Unbelievably great piece of movie art
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,10,"Just amazing. The plot and the acting. Touching, depressing, emotional, even funny, realistic, you name it.
Extraordinary well made but no, that is not your typical movie of these days. People rating it below 8 probably expected some kind of marvel action.
It could have gone for another hour..."
" Impacting movie, unfortunatelly this still happens nowadays.
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,8,"Brilliant movie, very well acted, the plot is basic but very strong. I'm not giving a 10 because of the little kid, that was unnecessarily naked or with lack of clothes in lot of scenes, the director didn't need to show him in that way. It is an excellent Canadian/Irish production, well done."
" Full of suspense and excitement
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,10,"An excellent film that is well directed, with a very good plot and excellent performances. TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!"
" One of those movies you can't forget
",2021-01-08 00:00:00,9,"It's just wonderful to see the adaptability of a 5-year-old, his innocence
A film to reflect on the love of life
A mother's unconditional love
And how human beings can adapt and accept to any condition
The subject is profound and painful.
Prepare your handkerchiefs for crying
The performance is worthy of an Oscar"
" 'Room' is horrible, but I love it
",2021-01-07 00:00:00,9,"This film does something quite special: it makes an inanimate object an antagonist. This is done through cinematography that feels cramped, performances from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay which are both mesmerising, and a great screenplay which makes us think 'if we're frustrated, what must they feel like?'. It's not an easy watch, it shows everything, whether you want it to or not. It's gross, cramped, heartbreaking, but also brilliantly acted, shot and written. 'Room' is fantastic."
" A hard but beautiful movie
",2021-01-07 00:00:00,10,"A pure brilliance shines through the movie, and the acting is superb. It's really a piece of art."
" Intelligently moving.
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,9,"When I didn't know if there were films that could surprise me, this film was able to do that. I believe that it is not a perfect film, there are some flaws and weaknesses in the script, if we have time to analyze it more deeply. After some reading I realized that the film is based, very vaguely, on a real situation that occurred in Austria just over fifteen years ago, and that it was a true horror film turned into reality.The film is profound and touching in many ways. First, because it brings us a cruel history of deprivation of liberty, rape, abuse and suffering. Second, because it tells us all this from the innocent perspective of a child who has never seen the world beyond the room where he was born, and where he lives imprisoned with his mother, at the hands of a cruel man, who is also his biological father, but that the film will make clear that he is not the boy's father. And in fact, what father would deserve to be treated as such after doing something like that to a son, isn't it? The film is truly beautiful and elegant, and wonderfully harmonizes the child's perspective, who sees the world and things in his own way, and the mother's perspective, which is basically ours too, and who has a clear sense of what is happening and the drama they're experiencing.Despite the harshness of the story told, the film never assumes itself as a thriller or a drama. In fact, there is a touch of fairy tale that greatly softens the tone and ambience. At no time did we feel truly tense, despite the situation of the characters being tense and not envisaging much success. The second half of the film is even smoother and more luminous, and shows how mother and child will try to rebuild their lives and their families after all that tragedy.The film does not have a big cast, and the characters have plenty of time to develop and take on complex psychological nuances and contours. The most developed and interesting are clearly the Mother and her son, Jack. And Brie Larson was amazing at how she brought this desperate and brave mother to life. She was capable of one of the most breathtaking and professional dramatic and interpretive works I have seen in some time, and deserved the awards she received for this film in all fairness. Jacob Tremblay, who brought Jack to life, also deserves congratulations. Apparently, and despite his young age, he already had some experience as an actor when he made this film, but there is no doubt that we rarely see actors so young shining so completely. He did a better job than many adults would have done, I am sure of that. And the way both actors interact in front of the camera is magnificent, dignified, credible and genuine. I also really liked the work of Joan Allen and Sean Bridgers, although the film does not reveal what happens to the villain, who just disappears.Technically, it is a superb and intelligent film. One thing that I observed carefully, and that I did not want to miss, was the quality of the dialogues, in particular Jack's monologues, in which he makes very pertinent and intelligent observations to the world around him. It is wonderful to enter the child's mind and see the world through his eyes. Cinematography is equally extraordinary, especially in the first half of the film, due to the way the camera manages to convey the feeling of being in such a limited space. The setting and the smallness of the entire physical filming space clearly helped and the construction of the whole set and costumes was also a smart bet on the part of Lenny Abrahamson, who ensured the direction of the film. It is a slow-paced film, with time for many reflections and ramblings that never seem to be too much in the film. The soundtrack is quite good, but it does not distract us from the essential, which is the story told and the relationship between that mother and her child, and between that child and the new world that opens up for her."
" One of the 2015's Best
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,10,"With stellar performances, fantastic writing from Emma Donoghue, and an altogether breathtaking story- Room is more than just a simple thriller, more than just a simple drama, and more than just another awards contender. It's a powerful, unforgettable, and emotional experience that hits home in every way you can think of. There is no doubt in my mind that Brie Larson deserves every award she got for this film. Some people criticize her online for her acting being dull, similar to what people did earlier in the career of actress Jennifer Lawrence, but after watching Room there is no doubt in my mind that she was perfect for the role and is capable of so much when it comes to work on the big screen. Jacob Tremblay also provides an emotional and core performance to the film as her son, Jack, and perhaps provides the best performance I've ever seen of someone of such a young age. His character can be a bit predictable at times, but Tremblay brings a life to it that would have otherwise been missed. The direction can be a bit broad or dull at times, but due to Donoghue's terrific screenplay and all the talent involved the film transcends its flaws and makes for quite a brilliant and very memorable experience.
My Rating: 9.75/10"
" Simply the best.
",2020-12-18 00:00:00,9,"This movie is so good in its own way, i was very sceptical watching it but the story, metaphors and the boy transcending from a small room to the large world is phenomenal. To look the world from eyes of jack was so new. It is an awesome movie and a must watch."
" This is not a normal film
",2020-12-11 00:00:00,10,"Have you ever watched a film and thought ""I've seen this before"". The same old plot rehashed, good vs evil, victim vs oppressor, with the good oh so perfect and the evil eventually getting their cummuppence at the end of the film?
If that's what you want, don't watch this film. If you want all action scenes, if you want in depth character analysis, a view into the psyche of a kidnapper, a morality lecture, a commentry of the state of society, the trauma of rape, or just like seeing the bad guy eventually getting killed after the mandatory end of film fight when he rises from the apparent dead before eventually being finished off, but not before some trite final exchange between the hero and villan, then don't watch this film. You'll be disappointed. If that's what you want, there are 1000s of other films you can watch.
This film tells the story entirely from the point of view of a 5 year old child. Elements of the story that don't involve the child aren't shown. Issues with the characters that don't affect the child aren't shown, and those that do affect him are only shown in that context. No attempt to explain or analyse why the adults are behaving in the way they do. Lots of unanswered questions that an adult would ask, such as about possible methods of escape, which are not dealt with. Because the film is not from the POV of an adult. That's what most of the critics of this film simply didn't get.
It also doesn't follow the usual flow of a film. It doesn't build to a climax at the end, the climax is in the middle.
Whether you like or hate this film, at least you won't have seen it before, or most likely anything like it. If you prefer your films to follow traditional plotlines and being told from a traditional angle then don't waste your time. But if you want to see something different, if you want to see a story from a different angle, then you might just love it, as I did."
" Oh my god, what the hell was that
",2020-12-10 00:00:00,2,"That was awful absolutely awful. Brie Larson won an Oscar for her role, I'm assuming there wasn't much competition that year. Literally the film was a whole lot of nothing. I was waiting for the guy to come back and seek revenge or something, you know something entertaining, but no. They went for the more boring route of things. Also that little girl was the most annoying little sod I've ever experienced. 8.1 is an absolute joke of a rating, what the hell are you people thinking, do you know what a good film is? I was so hyped to watch this after reading the reviews. I was so let down believe it or not."
" A beautiful piece of art in that it means something different for everybody
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,8,"I knew the general plot of this film before watching, although I wish I'd read the book first. A woman is being held hostage in a room with her child born in captivity. The story is told from the perspective of the 5yo boy, who does not understand that there is a real world outside.To me, it is a story of perspective. The boy, who knows nothing else, sees his tiny grimy space as a whole world in itself. The cinematography accentuates this feeling by never showing ""room"" in it's entirety in one shot ever, despite being a 10x10 space. We see the wardrobe, where Jack hides when ""Old Nick"" comes in to visit Ma, the bathtub / kitchen space, bathroom, and bed as unique places in different scenes, as Jack does. It does not feel claustrophobic to Jack, but we also see it through the eyes of Ma as the viewer.***SPOILERS***Ma is intelligent, patient, and resourceful. She has tried to escape in the past, unsuccessfully. But after Jack is born, her priorities change. She has to keep him safe. She makes sure he gets vitamins and brushes his teeth, despite receiving very little from her captor, and keeps Jack away from Nick. She teaches him to read and exercises with him. And yet, we feel her pain and hopelessness. She expertly negotiates with and earns the trust of Nick, for Jack's sake. Jack is watching her carefully, and eventually she reveals the truth only when he is old enough to understand, and when circumstances force her hand. She does brave things without thinking and coaches Jack to help with their escape.When Jack is riding in that truck, my heart was pounding in my chest. I was so emotionally invested that it felt real to me. I was so afraid that Nick would capture him before he got help, echoing famous cases like Jeffrey Dahmer, when he convinced strangers that his victim was out of their head. Even after the female police officer's intuition led her to take the boy seriously (and she was my favorite btw), I was still afraid and did not know what would happen. It was pure joy to see them reunite. And what was so great about it is that there is never a cut to the captor or anyone else. This story is about Ma and Jack and their experience. One might argue it as a feminist work that puts in focus the unique and empathetic view so often neglected or sidelined in society. The typical perspective is briefly represented by her father's reaction, a perfect example of toxic masculinity preventing the acknowledgement of his own grandchild.It is such a penetrating view that it barely needs to be verbalized at all to be understood. It is internalized in Ma when she continues to punish and blame herself and her mother after they are safe. A raped woman is a ruined woman, and a child of rape (or from any other less than perfect circumstance for that matter) is doomed to the way they came into the world, specifically their biological parents. The reaction of everyone (except Jack) to Ma's enlightened and brave answers in her media interview is heart wrenching to watch. It reminded me of something I heard Elizabeth Smart say in interviews when asked why she didn't try to run away. She said that unless it happens to you, you do not know what you will do. And no one should ever be judged for how they react as victims, but especially women as rape victims because of the complicated stigma and endemic sexism. This is the kind of judgement a man would never be subjected to, and the reason victims rarely report at all, especially male victims, who lose all claim to manhood.Jack is the shining star in the story (though Brie Larsen's performance, particularly in the first half deserved an Oscar). Thanks to his incredible mother, and his young age, he adjusts well to life outside the room. As children often do, he helps his mother more than he realizes by simplifying the world through his eyes. It's a wonderful testament to family and how important they are for overcoming adversity in life, through unconditional love, even when it's uncomfortable. It reminds us that we can find joy and wonder in the most peculiar places if only we can adjust our perspective."
" Emotional
",2020-11-16 00:00:00,8,"Captivating performances from the two leads.
This film works emotionally so well."
" Materpiece
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,9,"Wow, this movie is very deep!I liked literally everything: the plot, the acting, the actors, the soundtrack and even the times it takes to its self to let you process every fact and emotion.
It's just at the beginning (if you haven't read the plot) that you can be a little bit disoriented (I thought that the child was a girl) but then everything become clear. And it engulfs you.
Oh, and there are some crying moments."
" Boys acting was amazing
",2020-11-11 00:00:00,8,"I'm reading the girl who played the mother got a oscar for this but it should be the boy Jack the boy Carrys this film
I knew it would be emotional there have been many captivity movies ever since The very real life of fritz from Austria who kidnapped his own daughter for 30years in a basement.. how ever this is more about the boy born in captivity who doesnt understand theres a real world out there till he turns 5 and his mum finally snaps and fast forces him to try several escape plans
I was on the edge of my seat hoping the stranger would save him. The mother finally out, rather than get her and her free'd child on a plane out of there for a ocean vacation instead tries to top herself, again it's the boy left strong. I hated they cut off his beautiful hair, hated his grandfather he need his head smacking
And as a mother I wouldve shut the interviewer right down with her insured questions about the dad. 1 thing didn't make sense is why theyd need money for lawyers pretty sure it wouldve been the state paying for prosecution. Either way this childs rollercoaster of emotions are incredible acting for a child so young and on such a deep topic you wouldnt think a child that age could grasp. It did get drawn out in places, ot couldve gone into a horror where the baddy goes for revenge but dodnt and I'm fine with that. A film to make you appreciate what you have even if it's only little. I'd say the movie is a 7/10 but the boys acting is a 9 why I generously gave the extra 1 star"
" A Fantastic Movie
",2020-10-27 00:00:00,10,"I was also not sure about it in the start but I kept watching. This film is shockingly very good. The kid showed courage like no other. It's pretty bad for the Mom's character that she only thought of herself.
I actually had thought that when she asked Jack to escape that she was doing it for Jack. I was pretty sure that Nick would go back and kill the Mother but weirdly they found the mother alive and even arrested Nick. Nick was the only character with too many faults.
Overall it was a great movie and a must to watch if you like emotional movies and can connect to characters.
I loved it where Jack told that he loves his Grandmother."
" What are people watching?
",2020-10-18 00:00:00,1,"I expected this to be a really moving experience. WOW, all those awards for Brie Larson: every group that had an award gave it to her. What I want to know is whyWhyWHY? It was a flat, uninspired performance that bored me to utter distraction. The child was just irritating: I wanted to feel empathy and concern, but I just didn't get it from his performance. I know it's unfair to be critical of a child, but so much of the movie depended on liking him that even a neutral response undercuts the whole experience. Rotten Tomatoes compilation of of professional and audience reviews are bot 93%. Are you kidding me? I think that this is one of those ""Emperor-Has-No-Clothes"" situations. Very few reviewers wanted to be contrarians: I'd be willing to bet that if they were given an honesty potion, that the results would be muchMuchMUCH different. What a waste of my life."
" Must See
",2020-10-13 00:00:00,10,"If you're overly emotional (whatever that is) don't see this film. It will pull at your heartstrings and gutstrings in ways you never believed possible. Brie Larson is phenomenal in the role of ""Ma."" She goes to dark places so effortlessly, I had trouble calling it acting. The title is appropriate because everything in the movie is a room, and the cinematography probes the various rooms and their effects on the residents. Don't expect pat answers. You are left with many questions. Unless you are a Trump, you will be moved."
" An interesting and wonderful film
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,8,Brie Larson played his role so well that it's impossible not to get into the movie. Jacob also played the role in a great way.
" Room
",2020-10-08 00:00:00,9,Nice story and Brie Larson deserved an Academy Award for her role in the movie
" This movie is worth watching just to see the performance by Jacob Tremblay
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,5,"The book is brilliant, heart-wrenching, and visual. I must admit the child playing young Jack did so with poise and grace. An actor I cannot wait to see more from.
I was disappointed by the performance of Brie Larson. She just didn't provide the flesh Ma had in the book, justice was not paid to the character. There were moments where it felt like Larson was reading from a blurry teleprompter. Ma was tragic without being weak. Larson was not able to provide that feeling. The supporting cast were outstanding enough to carry the slack. I was gobsmacked when she (Larson) won the Oscar. This performance is proof that money can buy you a statuette.
I am giving the film five stars for Young Master Tremblay and the others that make this film worthy of a serious look. Which is a shame, the transfer from page to screen was genuinely awesome."
" Good movie
",2020-10-03 00:00:00,8,"Room is about a woman names Joy who is kidnapped for seven years during which she also has a son named Jack. She finally manages to escape and lives with her parents. Till the opening half of the film we are shown the life of the mother and son duo. Joy is very protective of her son and she makes many plans including one where he pretends he is dead to get out of the room. After much struggle they manage to get out of the room and halfway in to the film and honestly I though it would be boring but director showed us a part which is normally not shown in a kidnapping story. We were shown how Joy who was held captive for seven years copes with the world and have her five year old son who has seen nothing but the room entire life. I personally thought it would be Jack who wouldn't be able to cope with, but it was Joy. It was very interesting to see how many different things the director has thought about and what all character goes through."
" Emotional story
",2020-10-02 00:00:00,7,"Listen, I'm just gonna say it. This isn't an 8.1/10 (current rating on IMDb). I'd say 7/10 is a pretty solid rating of it overall.I'll start with what's good. The story is an emotional ride with phenomenal acting from all involved. For this alone it's worth watching.
The film really illustrated well the physical and mental issues a mum and kid would have in this situation and it's that detail that really makes the film better.My major beef I have with this film stems in the 2nd hour. Mainly because nothing of interest really happens. 1st half you're gripped as you watch her lose her mind yet and try to escape. 2nd half, sod all actually happens and it skips out certain storylines that could have made it more interesting. All other characters played a really small role there was no point in them. I get that it's focusing on the mum and son. But the film needed that something to keep the audience somewhat entertained. Because you know how it's going to end, so you feel like you're just waiting for it.Overall, it's a lovely watch that gripped me emotionally. But slightly let down by the 2nd half of the film. 7/10 for me."
" I cried for that child and mother!
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,7,"Incredibly sad to watch as a mother, but the reality of it is that this kind of crap happens in today's world. I think the creators did a great job showing their perspective of such a tragic situation."
" Great Story About True Love
",2020-09-28 00:00:00,8,It was great story about true love between mom and her young boy & you will be fascinated by watching this movie. could you imagine yourself in such difficult and weird situation? its unbelievable I cannot Imagine myself in such situation. you even don't know there is a world outside these walls & you can watch the it for beyond the these walls. the actor and actress acting perfect. if you wanna watch a movie and enjoy it I'll suggest you to watch this one.
" Amazing movie exceptional acting
",2020-09-25 00:00:00,10,"Loved this movie true to life!! People really do go missing, and they are kidnapped.. people who survive probably really go through all the aftermath. The acting was exceptional and very moving, Having a little boy myself it really made me feel Emotional, both main actors played an outstanding performance, best film I've seen in a long time! Well done netflix"
" A snooze
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,5,"Really a v boring dull film with a rating of 8.1 I can only guess people are sick of Marvel comic films and this must had been seen as fresh deep film.
One thing that's troubling is how no one can see that the little boy (Jack) is in fact a little BOY ! Are they blind ? This LONG and tiresome story really didn't sustain much interest for me, but it talks all sorts.
If you want a long depressing dull film then this is spot on.
I give it 5 for good acting and score but other than that it's hard work."
" Goosebumps
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,10,I never thought a little kid could act that well. All of the cast members acting was phenomenal. It's a really good movie. I've had goosebumps for the whole entire movie. It was so inspirational and a feel good movie. It makes you feel excited to know what happens next. Can't believe that I've watched it three time. Definitely would recommend you to watch it.

" Stockholm Syndrome through the eyes of a child
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,8,A film basically about a childhood being born into Stockholm Syndrome.You know the dreadful events that his mother (ma) as been put through since her capture 7 years prior but the film really revolves around the boy who as only seen the world from a skylight for his first 5 years of existence. Being told that there is other people then learning to adapt to going from captivity to freedom.It makes you think of real life events over the last years when women have got freedom after decades of improvement from offenders and that what becomes of not just them but the children they have born whilst being held.It's a different film and very well acted. Worth a view
" Cor Blimey.
",2020-09-05 00:00:00,9,"Before i started watching this, i was expecting something more along the lines or a thriller or a horror, but man i wasn't disappointed when i was wrong about it.This movie has a way of pulling on every heart string you have, and it's the first movie in such a long time that i have watched, that i have felt as if i was in the place of both the mother, and son. I was sitting on the edge of my sofa, willing them both on, may or may not have cried.This is an exceptional work of art."
" Impressive
",2020-09-04 00:00:00,8,Beautiful performances driven by a strong storyline.
" Room - 8/10
",2020-09-04 00:00:00,8,"Engrossing, emotional and ultimately endearing, Room follows a mother and son who, after spending 7 and 5 years respectively in the titular room, must re-adjust to family and society. Brie Larson is good as Ma and does an excellent job at portraying her anguish and grief. As the viewer you can only imagine what must be going through her characters' head, but it's Larson that really sells the distortion and her performance demands emotion. Jacob Tremblay is the most impressive by far, being only nine at the time of filming, who plays the son, Jack. It's really interesting to see Jack's perception of the room, or just Room, as it's the only place he's ever known. You'd expect him to be more open with the outside world, but his drastically sheltered life makes it a slow process as he's used to his creature comforts. Tremblay does a really good job at selling his emotional scenes too and I enjoyed his pieces of narration throughout the film. The soundtrack was okay, it worked really well for the emotional scenes, but some of it felt a little too grandiose for the scene's it was played over. William H. Macy's an amazing actor and whilst I feel he was the slightest bit underused, his character and role in the story still made a strong, emotional impact. The mother-son relationship that runs through this film's core is what makes it so endearing, despite their predicament, Ma still does her best to give Jack as normal a childhood as she can and she does her utmost to shield him from the real horror of their situation. Glad I finally checked this out as it's been on my radar for years, was definitely worth it and I'm looking forward to starting the book."
" A powerful, tender, and ultimately life-arrirming story.
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,8,Heart breaking and realistic look at a case involving kidnapping.
" One of the best films I've ever seen - a phenomenal experience!!
",2020-08-29 00:00:00,10,"Wow. This film completely blew me away. I was expecting something special what with Brie Larson winning the Oscar for her performance and the numerous good reviews, but I wasn't prepared for how powerful, emotional and moving this film was.Room is such a whirlwind of emotions, from utter despair to hope this will have you feeling everything. I was in tears for near enough a whole 10 minutes in the middle due to the swell of emotions. The plot is perhaps one best left to experience yourself, so I won't go into any depth, but suffice to say it is devastatingly heart-warming (despite the paradoxical nature of that statement I believe it's apt!).At the heart of this film was the beautiful, close yet complicated relationship between Ma and Jack, portrayed so incredibly well by Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. I can't emphasise enough how astoundingly good both of them were. The character of Ma was so well written, with so much depth and nuance. Her interactions with Jack were so captivating and engaging, I almost want to watch Room again straight away to experience them again immediately.I'm always in awe of films which manage to draw so much out of such a small space, and the way that the confined environment of Room was used and explored was magnificent. It's a real lesson in cinema and technically its a spectacular film, as well as being so visceral.Room has to be one of the best films I've seen in recent years. I've called a few films a 'must see' before, and the term gets bandied about perhaps a bit too loosely at times, but it could not be more apt when it comes to Room. One of the best experiences I've had watching a film, truly phenomenal."
" Spoon-fed emotions.
",2020-08-27 00:00:00,2,"Things seen through the eyes of a child, which is a bit manipulative and easy, I thought. That's the kind of thing people love these days. They turned something that would've made a good thriller into a sappy drama. With awkward acting and lots of yelling and crying. Nothing looks genuine in this movie, so the emotional aspect fails to convince. And the kid really got on my nerves. Clearly not a film for people who like feeling things their own way, like me. Even actors I usually love disappointed me. But I get it, it's all feel-good despite its subject, which makes it off beat, but once you know the trick, what is there to look for?..."
" Sad, but Uplifting
",2020-08-25 00:00:00,10,"This movie was sad, but very heartfelt. At moments, it had me getting ready to cry. Brie Larson definitely commanded the screen with her performance. I've listened to podcasts and videos on people who were kidnapped, and watching her, it felt like I was watching one of those real life stories. Jack was a bittersweet story. I felt bad cause he was born into this terrible position, but being able to experience real life was so uplifting. At many points in this movie, I thought scenes were gonna play out another way, and I was so glad they didn't. I also appreciated the little narration of Jack, because he always said me and you, never me and Ma, kind of addressing the viewer themselves. Also, props to Emma Donoghue for not only writing the book, but also the screenplay."
" Beautiful made film of a disgusting story
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,10,"Even the idea of this actually happening shreds me to the core; yes somewhere, sometime this could have happened :(I love that the movie was completely from the perspective of the child... the story doesn't shift even in the 3rd act, Ma faints and goes to hospital, we still stay with the kid.The performance, my god was Brie astounding in every single frame with a wide range of emotions, where was this Brie in Captain Marvel. Her acting felt so real that I could relate so much of a similar person with similar emotions of distress.The shooting done is the Room was very smart, they captured the essence pretty well. Even in later house, the close door cinematography was done with great angles of stairs.Its the little things that I loved, learning to walk down the stairs, world outside being TV, the attention to details. Movie starts with Goodmorning and ends with Bye Bye.
The thrill that was involved in the escape sequence was perfect.I love that they didn't waste time on things that I thought they would, 'oh whole 2hr movie is ganna take place in a Room... nope' , 'oh the other half will be about finding the Ma... nope' realistic use of Satallite to find the truck, fabulous writing of 3 Stop Sign. The movie was grounded in reality, hence I love it so much.The characters had great progression, she would definitely have this kind of reaction given the trauma of being 'Thankful' to others. Her trying her best for the child, breastfeeding till 5 years and understanding she isn't a good Ma, but still HIS Ma.Idea of long hair being Strength and the whole outside World being TV, beauty of storytelling."
" Captivating
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,9,"This is one of the most emotional films I have ever seen. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay's performances were incredible and alternated between extremely heartbreaking and heartwarming. You really feel everything in this film - the bond between mother and son, the stress of trying to escape, the overwhelming nature of the world at large, and more."
" A Surprisingly Well-Done Movie about Trauma
",2020-08-21 00:00:00,7,"Room starts off by introducing us to Joy and her 5-year-old son Jack and their lives as captives inside this small room (that they cleverly call ""Room""). I went into this movie expecting it to be entirely about their lives within the Room and about their eventual escape. However, I was pleasantly surprised that it actually tackled Joy and Jack's life after Room and their adaptation to life after a massive trauma.Instead of flawlessly embracing freedom from their captor and captivity, Joy and Jack struggle to assimilate back into their lives, back into the real world. Things, understandably, changed from how they were before Joy was kidnapped, and it follows her as she tries to understand those changes. As it usually is in these kinds of situations, escaping a man who has kidnapped and raped you for years doesn't mean that life after escaping is perfect. I like that it showed their initial happiness with escaping and their gradual downhill fall as they (Joy mainly) have to face the emotions that come after the fact. Throughout it all, Jack has romanticized Room as a safe haven against the huge world (and eventually has this romantic fantasy shattered at the end of the movie). Joy wrestles with frustration with herself and Jack, asking why she isn't happy now that she's free. I thought the movie did a great job of portraying how people really are after events like this happen and how complicated life after can truly be. I wanted Joy and Jack to be happy, but it just wasn't that easy.Brie Larson was really great as Joy and gave a genuine, heartfelt performance. Jacob Tremblay was pretty good, too, which is fairly rare for a child actor.Overall, I was really impressed with this movie and would definitely rewatch sometime."
" Incredibly real & disturbing. A bit slow though
",2020-08-21 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed this movie. Although it was a bit slow overall there were definitely a few moments where I held my breath. However, I feel like the movie should have focused more on the room and the escape instead of life after the escape. Once they got out it was quite boring. The movie should have just ended there IMO."

",2020-08-10 00:00:00,6,"A beautifully told story through the eyes of a brilliant 5 year old. Such innocence beautifully portrayed.Great performances, a good film. Nothing more.I have a few issues with this film1) Would the mother trust her child with a man who was willing to keep them captive for so many years?2) How lucky, Old Nick put the rug on the right hand side of the truck, meaning Jack could roll out to the left as practiced.3) Why would Old Nick just drop Jack like that?4) It took all of 30 mins to locate both the room and Old Nick.5) Surely wouldn't Jack & Ma have more psychology damage?"
" Boring after the first hour

" WTF
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,1,WTF!! Who is the maker of this film? He just ruined the story and motherhood...
" Innocent perception of a Child somehow brings conviction in this inconvenient and Harrowing Film.
",2020-07-12 00:00:00,7,"Room (2015) :
Brief Review -Innocent perception of a Child somehow brings conviction in this inconvenient and Harrowing Film. Room is about a child and his mother who were locked in a Room, they manage to get out but finds it tough to conform with the real World outside the Room. Let's move to the plus points, the major factor and the most convenient thing about this film is the Child Jack. His innocence, his perception about the world inside the room and the outside world makes a clean and coherent sense. Imagine yourself as a 5 years old kid who hasn't got out of a Room since birth, how would you react when you see the Real world? How would you adjust your imagination about the thing called 'The World'? How would you survive? This all makes it very intelligent scenerio and almost nobody can find any contradictions in this part at least. The second best thing about the film is partition of the narrative in two parts, one inside the Room and other one about outside the room. Jacob Trembley and Brie Larson gave beautiful and natural performances. Almost 90% screentime is focused on them so they got every variety to try. Director Lenny Abrahamson has definitely made a very good film and his direction is one of the major reason behind it. I liked the way he used background score and camera while showing the child's perspective. Especially when he sees the outside for the first time, the camera shoots from inside the rolled mattress and trees pass by. Now coming to the minuses, there are many inconvenient things about the story in the first half. In the second half, it tries to explore depression for no valid reason. I mean the girl has just got out, she must be happy and curious about Future but instead she's drown in the memories of the horrible past. The depressing thoery doesn't work entirely hence film loses the main motive. Overall, A Very Film but IMDb Top 250 seems unmeritable.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest"

It felt like they have streached the story and we are watching for nothing!Yes, if we look at the movie from the 5 year kid's perspective and then try to feel it. It feels, but no ! The emotions disappears instantly as the movie doesn't hold a story. It is slow paced and needed some strong story which can hold us with the storyline.And, how ! I thought throughout the movie that Jack was a girl ! And even after watching his getting haircut, I can't believe he was not she but he!Alrighty, so in a single sentence :
The movie could be better and it is a bit overreted."
" room
",2020-06-23 00:00:00,9,"Trapped and claustrophobic at the age of 17, Joy spent seven years in a cage before graduating from high school. The film does not describe the pain she suffered, but it is conceivable that if it were not for the birth of her child, she would have gone into a nervous breakdown. In some ways, coming out of captivity, she had a harder time adjusting to normal life than her own children. Because a child who has never seen the larger world only has to face the fear of the unknown, and who has been robbed of her normal life needs to find the meaning of life again.So we see Joey back at home, chronically depressed and reluctant to see anyone; He scolded his mother for teaching him ""be kind to others"" when he was young, which led to his being easily tricked.The media questions killed the last straw in her heart.
The last question the media asked joey before he killed himself -- why not ask his captors to send the baby to a hospital or nursery as soon as he was born, in exchange for his relative freedom by ""sacrificing himself to help others""?
Joey's answer is -- because Jack needs me.
What a feeble excuse, and then she fell into a long silence -- it was not only old Nick who kept the child in the room, but also herself who, as a ""selfish"" mother, deprived the child of the freedom he deserved.
In the constant torture with his soul, Joy broke down and finally chose to commit suicide."
" I'm glad I didn't see the trailer.

" The room in heart is the most difficult to escape.
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,9,"The little boy is so cute that he especially likes his inner monologue. The mother is also a strong and great person who can educate children in such a narrow space.Movies touching the heart, the world of children is not as complicated as that of adults. Their innocence is that we have lost it and can never find it again. It is really not easy to think about the world we live in! The acting skill of the little boy is simply amazing. It was in 2006 that the child was only under 10 years old when he made this movie. Only a gifted boy can be said."
" Surprisingly sweet, well executed and acted
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,8,"I don't watch many films like this, the ones you know before going in to that you'll shed a few tears. Just not a fan. However, locked up in quarantine has made me more adventurous you could say.
I knew what the film was about but never watched a trailer for it. I assumed it was a story of the mom who happens to raise her kid in awful conditions but the focus is really on Jack and how he has to grow up in those awful conditions. Jacob Tremblay is an amazing little actor for being as young as he is here. He carried half the film on his own.
I wish we learned a little more about Old Nick and why he was doing what he did or what happened to him after, just a tad more than the tidbits we saw.
I do appreciate the fact that this didn't focus on the physical or sexual abuse, I can only think of 2 times either of those were shown or heard and they last maybe 15-30 seconds at most. The rest of it is implied and we can instead focus on Jack and Ma reacting to their situation and finding a way out of it all.
Brie Larson also does a fantastic job as Ma. I know those feelings of frustration and patience when it comes to kids and she absolutely nails it. Facial expressions and all.
I enjoyed the end most as Jack finally experiences a bit of real childhood making friends and playing with a dog. Just small things that make a drastic difference in his life. A sweet and relatively pleasant ending to what it could have been."
" outside world
",2020-05-30 00:00:00,8,"It 's been a long time since I saw a good movie like this.Joy, who was kidnapped by a bad guy when he was 17, was confined in a small house. After two years of torture, he gave birth to the little boy Jack. This brought a bright color to her life, where they lived together for five years in a place called Room. Lovely Jack, thinking that this is his world, his mother thought that the danger was approaching at any time, and then told him there was a bigger world outside the skylight in the room. Joy concealed the bad guys by letting Jack pretend to die, and finally let Jack escape to life, and he was finally rescued.This is a very sensational movie, but the plain picture has a lot of tears. It is difficult to imagine how to spend every night and day in a small space, not to mention the prolonged seven years. At the same time, the helplessness of reality is also reflected from the perspective of Jack. When the space is large, the distance between people is also widening, how much helpless. The plot of this movie is not absurd. People may suspect that the heroine has many ways to escape. This is just the view of outsiders. There are realistic cases in our lives. When you are in this situation, you may not be like her Living hard, guarding everything about Jack. Jack is also a brave and loving child, it is he and his mother hug those boring days.The outside world is big and exciting, but it is a bigger challenge for the mother and daughter who escaped. The outside made Jack feel terrified and uncomfortable, and thought about the Room time with both his mother. My mother was also hysterical and depressed during communication with her parents and the media. She tried to commit suicide. Fortunately, Jack was found in time and sent to medical treatment. Eventually, Jack and his mother walked out of the enclosure together. When they visited the former hut again, they discovered how small the original Room was, Jack and the things in the room.
When we say goodbye, we also formally bid farewell to the unbearable past and move towards a new future.In reality, we sometimes have the courage to walk out of our imprisonment and look back at what was once so narrow."
" A masterpiece in the analysis of human emotions.
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,10,"This movie is like a breeze of fresh air in a room where it is hot. It will make your hair stand on end, it will make you suffer with them, cry with them, love with them. Huge performances by Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay playing the role of captives. The reactions and situations are palpable and very realistic to the point of being able to question to what extent this story is fiction."
" Wow. Still my all time favorite
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,10,"This movie is not for everyone. If you're someone who just likes blockbusters( and there's nothing wrong with that) then this probably isn't for you. However this movie is amazing and I think everyone should give it a try. It's about a girl and her child as they deal with being kidnapped and life afterwards. The main themes of this movie being humanity and motherhood. I've never seen such a brilliant portrayal of the human condition before. Brie larsons's character is trying to care for her son with little resources and in a horrible situation. She raises him as best she can in the situation provided. It isn't often that a rich Hollywood actor or actress can really encapsulate what it's like to be that desperate or that caring, but Brie Larson absolutely kills it. She is so human In her portrayal. I was honestly surprised she isn't a parent now because she really encapsulates what it's like. She definitely deserved that Oscar. The kid who plays jack was very good as well, as he convincingly portrayed someone with no knowledge of the outside world. This movie is subtle and there's are no real action shots or adrenaline rushes besides the escape scene in the middle, but it's such a rewarding experience. You really care about these characters so much. And in the end when they say "" goodbye room"" it makes you so happy, because you went on the journey with them, and your so glad they've moved on. Overall a great movie"
" Boring
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,4,Movie is just boring. Never understand how she got the oscar for this. Total disappointment
" Excellent film.
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,8,"The first half is difficult to watch, but well worth the effort. The second half which shows how the family piece their lives back together is superb."
" Heartwhelming story
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,10,Loved it. The movie taught me that how grateful we are to have a beautiful and wonderful life.
" Room is timeless. It will live forever, and in its immortality, it will continue to inspire generations after we are all gone.
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,9,"There is an old saying, ""Don't judge a book by its cover."" I feel in terms of movies, it would translate to something like, ""Don't judge a movie by its trailer."" After watching Lenny Abrahamson's Room, I believe even more in the validity of this statement.If there is a way to experience a film like Room, then it is only one, and that is to jump into it with a childlike curiosity. Not a single word needs to be read beforehand, nor a frame of the trailer watched. With this statement, I feel its absolutely worthless for you to read this review and for me to type this.There is nothing special in the story, yet everything is so special. Even though it wasn't based on any specific incident, we all know of the countless similar cases of women enslaved by warped men and their tales of survival. Room is about another similar story of a young mom, Joy, better known as ""Ma"" who got kidnapped when she was 17 and has been held captive for almost 7 years now in a locked shed by her captor, who uses her as a ""sex slave"". Jack, is a five year old boy born to ""Ma"" who turns into her ray of light, her hope, and her survival in the end.I'm not going to talk about the plot here, as it's quite obvious from the trailer. If it isn't, better yet, go watch the movie directly and skip the trailer all together. The trailer was something holding me back from watching this movie for the longest time, and when I did finally saw it, I realized why the director chose to reveal almost the entirety of the plot in the trailer. Because this movie is not about its story, but about the way it is presented. Its about the emotions and the feelings of the characters and the way they drag you into their world, their pain becomes your pain, their small moments of joy become your moments of happiness.Room is a harrowing thriller, but not in the traditional sense of the word. It deals with a dark subject matter and the first half of the film can be quite disturbing. Yet director Lenny Abrahamson (Frank) has adapted the best-selling novel with grace and grandeur. Here is a film so artistically unique and deviant, chock full of genuine emotion thanks to its two outstanding performances, that isn't afraid to take risks and surprise at every turn.It is not an easy film to watch. It has the rare ability to actually make you grip the sides of your chair at particular moments. I believe any high tension scenes involving kids are sometimes deliberately put to manipulate the emotions of the audience. But Lenny actually managed to pull this off very well in this movie. The tension in the scene when Jack tries and finally manages to escape from ""Old Nick"" is so high that it get almost impossible to bear. It is perhaps a cruel coincidence that the music that places over this scene is by the great instrumental band This Will Destroy You.The film opens and ends in a 10 by 10 room (which I believe is the main character in the film, more on this later), that has no windows, a locked door, and no light other than that provided by an overhead skylight. The tone with which the movie opens, actually makes you feel like it's a Christmas movie at first! Jack running around saying good morning, to the objects which is all his world consists of; the lamp, the sinks, the plant, the refrigerator. Every inanimate object is like a dear friend to Jack. For him, they are all real. Together, they survive incomprehensibly difficult lives.
With as much joy as the film opens to, it drops its tone immediately as we slowly learn the bleak and grim reality of the room. It is but just a prison of torture for his Ma.By incredible ingenuity, motivated by love, Ma has kept Jack from realizing the horrors of their situation. It's hard to believe that anyone could be so motivated and capable, allowing the boy to believe that his situation is normal, but it works in the film and you accept it.Director Lenny Abrahamson has created one of the greatest fairy tales ever put on the screen. To try and make whatever sense she can of their harrowing situation and provide for Jack a 'normal' childhood, Ma creates a world of imagination. The TV Old Nick has stationed in a corner is their only window into another world. The skylight on the roof has become more like a painting.The second half of the film focuses more on Jack and Ma's awkward adjustment to life outside of their room which was their entire world for the past six years. There is a strong supporting cast including performances such as Joan Allen's role as Jack's loving Grandma and the ever convincing all-star William H Macy as a resistant Grandpa who is having difficulty accepting that his daughter is raising her rapist's son.There are some scenes that are so heart-warming that it will be difficult not to find yourself becoming emotionally involved. In one particular very touching and loving scene, Jack asks his Grandma to cut his long hair so that the strength that he thinks that his shoulder length hair possesses can be transferred over to his sick Ma so she can return home from the hospital. Jack who understandably is initially withdrawn from anyone other than his Ma simply tells his Grandma after she washes and cuts his hair that he loves her. This loving scene between Jack and his Grandma will stay with me forever.The best actors are the ones able to transport you into their characters' own universes, no matter how isolated from society they happen to be. Larson, Tremblay, and Joan Allen all have a tremendous range of emotional ability and are able to sell you on their story not just for two hours, but for an entire lifetime. With Room, Abrahamson goes the extra mile with his direction, and director of photography Danny Cohen keeps all eyes on Jack. The film asks us to examine how we view the world and how this viewpoint is shaped by our nurtured upbringing. The result is a breath-taking experience brought to life, one you won't soon forget.The cinematography in the room itself was surprising. I think most films would have tried for a more claustrophobic look. Instead, the dimensions in this are simply defined and unjudged. The abrupt camera pans while Jack is running from wall to wall brilliantly reflects the mindset of these trapped characters. This place is simultaneously small and their entire world; traversing the room is trivial, but also the greatest possible distance. Victory and closure is achieved by the closing scene is the brief moment perfect perspective when the room is seen from the outside.Director Lenny Abrahamson is no stranger to the strange, and with Room he's made a masterpiece of filmmaking. The entire idea of 'room,' the abstract concept of space, is ever-present in the production. In their bubble of room, Ma and Jack are restricted, as evident by Abrahamson's close angles and tight shots. The small space allows for high concept filmmaking, and when they get out of room, it only gets better, with a new color palette and experimental camera angles through Jack's eyes. The entire film is seen through the eyes of this child, and it's genius. What I loved about the book was its focus on Jack and how he adjusts to seeing this new world for the first time, and the movie never loses sight of that.The director & the writing team made sure there was not one dull moment. The addition of ""insignificant"" characters and plot twists are later realized to be so significant and influential in keeping the film alive throughout its duration. It was the little things that made this story one of the best I've seen in a long time. I experienced an entire palette of emotions all at once and was left in a deep level of curiosity and reflection. Very few films have the power to continue to influence its audience after the credits. Room is endless in the most beautiful way.Room is wise. It is a movie of extremes. In it's own magical way, the film makes staggering observations about life. What is real, what is not? What is our place in this endless universe? For Jack, Room is his entire world. Everything he knows and loves is right there. He looks up and sees the sky out of the skylight. Sometimes a dead leaf tumbles down. He questions it. Just like we do when we stare at the night sky glittering with shining stars. What lies beyond our microscopic corner of the universe? Will we ever be able to comprehend it? Can we ever be as brave as Jack?It is a bleak film, yet so full of hope. We live meaningless lives on a little blue dot. But that's not how we look at it. To us, we are the center of the universe. We are Jack. The world is our room.In one of the best child performances I can think of, young Jacob Tremblay essentially carries the movie on his tiny shoulders, especially in the second half. He gives it his strong. Together, they are heart-breaking, unforgettable, resilient and joyous.Room is timeless. It will live forever, and in its immortality, it will continue to inspire generations after we are all gone. It is one of the best films of the new millennium and after its two transcendent hours, you emerge a changed person, one who has a new appreciation for the tiny miracles of life that are usually ignored. Room is an ephemeral moment in time and I will always remember it with fondness."
" This is a great movie... IF you like 'CHICK FLICKS'!!
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,3,"Sorry, that's not me. I felt the movie was selling itself as a much more sinister thriller - but NOPE... it was slow, boring, and all about emotions, etc. (and I am a women - kind of atypical in my enjoyment of horror/thriller/action movies, but still...)
To Quote Blaine Edwards and Antoine Merriweather, ""HATED IT!"""
" Beautiful movie
",2020-05-24 00:00:00,8,I like the story of this movie. And the acting of that little boy is amazing (his name was Jack in movie ).
" Only love and courage, can heal the wounds of the past.
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,9,"A story that happened in reality, the heroine played very powerful, performed quite well, and fully demonstrated the psychophysiology of a tortured mother's love and education for her son, perseverance, confidence, and never admit defeat. The little boy's performance is also great. After they were rescued from one gloomy room to another, the process of lifting the psychological shadow was difficult and tortuous. It was not easy to give the child a sunny room!"
" There's plenty of room in hell for all the haters!
",2020-05-21 00:00:00,10,"Room is about the psychological journey of an abducted girl and her 5-year-old boy, who spend years kept in a room without any interactions with real-world but the girl's abductor.Expect to

" Room
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,6,"A well told story with great performances by the leads. However, it felt that subtlety took away from its substance."
" A interesting insight
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,8,"Likely from the description you'd think this film is about a mother and her son escaping from the grasp of a kidnapper . In reality this film is actually about the psychological effects of being a kidnap survivor , which makes this film a lot more unique and interesting than other films as well as a eye opener for when it comes to situations like this .In most films it focuses more on the event and once it over its over . The film ends . But this film does a welcome subversion focusing on how it isn't all good after tragedy's like this . It shows how media reacts , How family reacts and most prominently how the victims react . That on top the great acting from the whole cast makes this a based on true story film that many should see"
" Pretty darn good!
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,8,"I really liked this, but having read the book earlier - a few years back, can say that the book was easily better. Which is absolutely not to say that the movie sucks. Nah. The movie's great too! and it does justice to the book, its just the book was something else. and there's no reason to compare the two as both mediums have inherent strengths and flaws. Anyway, coming to the movie.. absolutely loved the initial part..I thought the casting's pretty good. When Jack gets into the truck and first stands up and looks at the world, I thought that shot was absolutely perfect! I kinda was wishing the whole escape thing got done and over with pretty quickly and i wish that was longer and the 2nd part could have shrunk but I guess there's also much to appreciate as by showing the entire journey post escape, it was made more wholesome and real. My other qualm is that when Joy meets Jack after the escape..like..there should have been some dialogues around how jack did a fantastic job! I mean..he's 5 years old for God's sake.. and he managed to pull off the whole thing..but thats buried under the carpet. also some insight into how she taught him to speak, alphabets etc.. Idk if all this was in the book but things I was wondering about now. But having said all that, fantastic movie. worth a one time watch for sure. and DO read the book guys!Top 5 moments
1. Loved the last scene where Jack says bye to everything. I absolutely loved that!
2. Loved the scene where Jack's in the truck and then stands up to look at the world. Phenomenal shot!
3. Loved the shots with Jack playing w/ the dog and with the friend and with Leo. Basically how he slowly opens up. Its lovely.
4. Love the scene where Jack discovers the mom's unconscious in the bathroom. His expressions!!
5. Love the scene where they're planning the escape after the mom finds the car in the dustbin and how he is so uncomfortable and yet cooperating with everything but says ""i HATE YOU"" and yet you can see just how much he loves her. OOOH also also
6. LOVE the scene where mom is giving the interview and she talks abt Jack and ah! that adorable smileSIGH:)"
" say bye bye to the room
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,8,"The movie is adapted from a true story, and the true story is far more cruel than the movie. Fortunately, the bad guys have been severely punished and the victims have been rescued.
When I watched this movie, I started with a heartfelt admiration for my mother who still tried her best to give her children a happy childhood in such a small and closed room and a hard life!
As the child grows up, old Nick is unemployed, and the child may be in danger at any time. A power outage ushered in a good chance to escape. The mother began to plan an escape plan. At this point, she was completely dare not to breathe and kept staring with breath until they were rescued .
However, escaping was only the beginning, long-term isolation from the outside world, changes in fate, and the outside world 's doubts about the mother ""why not send the child to the welfare home and leave him in the room for five years"" The cage of the soul. What's wrong with her? Why was she questioned? She is just a helpful little girl, a mother who loves her children deeply. This time, the child once again saved her with love and gave her strength. And her family's line ""We pass power to each other, no one can be strong alone"" is really touching.
The film is mostly described in the narrative of a child's perspective, less cruel and more tender, but still shocking. Jack's consistent love gave her mother the strength to help her escape from the physical and psychological prison. Eventually I can say bye bye to the room."
" room
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,8,"You are my whole world in the room, and you will not be afraid when you walk out of the room, because we are still together ... This sentence is said by the child, but the same applies to the mother, and it can even be said that the child saved the mother! From the child's point of view, the film seems easier to accept, but it is actually more cruel. The boy's monologue has tears in many places. Shameless Frank came to play the grandfather, and the line is finally gone."
" you and me aginst the world
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,7,"The first half of the film, I believe that all the audience, like me, for the mother and child can escapes to knead a cold sweat, and when their plan see will successfully, my in the mind also began to have a faint concerns, Jack's outlook on life world outlook is very narrow, although the mother as much as possible to ensure his health, vitamin, narrow space or let him sport!), but the psychological? His world was the distance from a hut to a skylight. How could he survive when he came out of the trap and saw the real birds, the blue sky, all kinds of people, exposed to the bacteria of the air and the complexity of human nature?However, I never expected that, although Jack began to have trouble fitting in, as a child, he soon learned everything, learned to contact and care for the grandparents he just met, learned to be strong and independent, and made friends of the same age. Instead, the mother collapsed in the face of everything lost and recovered and the pressure of public opinion. Why?There is a plot that I think is very well designed. Joy is showing Jack a picture of her with her friends when she was a student, and she says, ""do you know what happened to them?"" Jack says no, Joy says exactly, nothing happened, and then she has a fight with her mother and even blames her for what happened to her. She is dumbstruck by the host's questions on the talk show, and finally fails to commit suicide by taking drugs. This is a very clear expression of her psychological process. Joy was only a girl when she was cheated and imprisoned. From the swing set behind her grandparents' house that she had been telling Jack about, it can be seen that she grew up in a harmonious family environment and was a good girl who was healthy and had no bad habits and was willing to help others. Maybe she had never experienced a real love heartbreak. When a person is suppressed in a few meters square room, she thought only how to escape, and when the real escape, she began to lose the seven years of heartache, is much transformed, parents are not together, that of his friends about also have their own family business, and she is just one of the world's most insignificant a single particle, didn't she, on the earth is still in turn, others are still in the forward, live a life, only oneself, and this world all contact solidification in seven years ago, out of place. There is only one achievement, and the seven years has brought up Jack lived alone with yourself, so when the host asked you have never thought in the Jack was born Old Nick put him in the fire department or hospital to let him have a real childhood, this is the last straw breaks the camel's, she's the only meaning there seven years were rejected, she the meaning of survival and life values must be collapsed. However, he was saved by his son Jack, who cut short his long hair and integrated into the society. However, he still kept the pure heart of being dependent on his mother.I believe that in the end, the mother and son returned to the room, where many people were in tears. At first, I thought the plot design was a little abrupt. Why should I go back to the place where I was imprisoned? After watching it, I wanted to ask the screenwriter to take my knee. I felt that the last scene cleared away the haze and heartache that the whole movie had brought to the audience. Suddenly, I realized that the film was not about how to escape, but how to make peace with the heavy past and finally move forward with hope. Some people may think the latter part is too much chicken soup, but I think in the treatment of the mother and son relationship, this degree of soft chicken soup I am still very willing to drink it, after all, did not cry to tell my mother to love me again, but is gentle and romantic, directly to the heart.If there really is a mother and son in some corner of the world or in some parallel universe, I would like to send my blessing to you, whether in a small room or in a big world, I hope you two can stay together, you and me agianst the world."
" WOW!
",2020-05-12 00:00:00,10,"I cried, I definitely cried, not once but maybe throughout the entire movie. I thought the movie was going to end when a major event took place, I was like Oh that was quick, what more could there be? I don't watch trailers or read description before watching movies(but I do check the rating) so I did not know what to expect. The fact that the story was kept so pure and so beautiful even after the end of the major turning point makes this movie one of my favorites. The child actor did everything so perfectly. That look of innocence and curiosity in his eyes really made him look like a baby who had just landed on earth."
" Boring and wasted potential.
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,1,"The 1/3 of movie focuses on a trapped family which tries to escape from a tiny house. They are locked by a keypad. The fact that the mother doesn't try to guess the combination of the lock in the time when the man is gone is just so dump. Even if he regulary changed the combination, she could've atleast looked at his hand movements, so you would have the idea which numvber he presses. She also could've made something sharper in her time which could cut the skin and she could've tried to cut his throat. Obviously logic wasn't the point of the movie. It was the emotional message... The family escapes after 1/3 of the movie and the rest of it are the boy's learning of the new world, which he doesn't do at all. He somehow lives an oridinary life as if nothing had happened. I mean nothing surprises him, he interacts with stuff as any other kid. His mother is also completely fine, they live as if nothing happened, they were trapped for many years you know. Oh and her parents also couldn't be more unrealistic, they don't even get surprised they found their lost daughter. This movie is pure garbage, it tries to go for emotional message instead of plot, but they had no idea how to make human emotions look real. Even The Room (2003) was better on plot and more emotional, that's saying something."
" That's great.
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,10,This is a story about redemption. Look at it once and move it once. It's so good
" Average
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,6,"A movie is always too small for a book to fit. Thrilling first half, characters in a hurry in the second half. Good acting by the mother"
" Very touching!!!
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,8,"This film was honestly really touching. It brought out a lot of emotions and really changed my perception of Brie Larson.Room follows Joy and her son, Jack, who've been held captive in an enclosed area which they've referred to as Room. One day, they get their freedom and her son gets to finally experience the outside world.What I really loved was the first hour. Director Lenny Abrahamson really managed to capture the claustrophic aspect of the 10 x 10 room as well as the lifestyle they had to adapt to for the years they were in there and made me genuinely care a lot for Larson and Tremblay. Putting us through the perspective of Jack was a clever choice by writer Emma Donoghue as we got to see his interpretation of the world compared to ours, making the film wholly interesting.For me, personally, the second half wasn't as engaging. It was still fascinating nonetheless as we got to witness Jack discovering and exploring this new world he wasn't familiar with as well as the psychological issues Brie Larson's character goes through when coming back. However, the film wasn't able to carry the same level of interest that I had in the first half.Aside from the tight script and direction, the two lead performances are what carry the film. I'm not really a fan of Brie Larson but I have to give credit where credit is due. She was terrific. Her emotions and facial expressions were executed perfectly. No wonder she won the Oscar. The one who really suprised me was Jacob Tremblay. It's insane how good he is throughout this film especially for his age at the time. These two are really believable as mother and son and have a wonderful connection with each other.Room will definitely make some people tear up. The story is very touching and the relationship between Larson and Tremblay make it all the more heartwarming."

",2020-05-01 00:00:00,9,"This is one of the best dramas I have ever seen with a very well-crafted score and acting. My favorite part of the movie, though, was the coziness that was established through the snug array of color balance and muted color tones along with the unmistakably powerful relationship between Ma and Jack. I would highly recommend this movie even if dramas are not your taste."

" good
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,8,"Between relative freedom and absolute freedom, movies have shown me what it is like to live in a modern society. Although the transition of space makes the film's surface painting style sudden change, in fact different space people's reaction to the surrounding has not changed, sometimes depressing people shudder, sometimes melted by warmth. Love makes us safe, and in order to be safe we take possession, possession destroys love."
" Mom,say bye bye to room.
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,8,"The story is from the perspective of the victim, talking about psychological self-help. It chose a very interesting entry point.Aside from the movie, the prototype story of the movie is really cruel and heartbreaking."

",2020-04-15 00:00:00,8,"No matter how muchI write, I won't be able to describe how great this movie is! really, really loved it. lt might seems dark to some people, but I'm pretty sure it's up lifting to anyone who's going through any sort of emotional breakdown. It's really great!"
" 6.7 Well thought out heart-warming story, small amount of Jacks character shown.
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,6,"This is a genuine feel good movie, the book was incredible in my opinion, but I guess it was harder to show emotions in the movie. A lot was changed from the book, and a few character names were changed as well, which annoyed me, especially since Donaghoe became the screenwriter. After the rescue, Jack becomes a quiet, respectful kid, without too much personality who mainly talks through his mom. In the book, he is separated from his ma for a week or so where he struggles a bit to make sense of everything in this big, new, scary world, and has some problems with his grandma. I feel like including this break from his Ma, would have been a productive dive into his character. Jack is shown by himself for a bit during Ma's suicide attempt, but the only deeper analysis we get is a 10s or so phone call where Jack asks Ma ""Why'd you try to go to Heaven early?"" and drops the phone. Ma has a decently shown character, she is seen arguing a bit with he mother and father, but seems a lot angrier at everything in the book including the interviewer. I also don't think she had enough dialogue, like when she met her mother and father (contrary to the book), she didn't say a thing, and Jacks grandfather wasn't shown to hate the thought of Jack very clearly. In the book, even Jack knew that Ma's dad didn't think he should of been born, under the circumstances, which was a realistic plot line that could have gone into a bit more depth. I don't, I guess this follows the 'book is a lot better' category in my opinion. I also think there's many Criminal Mind episodes that dive deeper into character than Room if I'm being brutally honest. (I'd give a 6.7 or so, don't know how to go into decimals on the stars)"
" Cannot believe I had not even KNOWN of this film....BRILLIANT!!!!!
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,10,"I had no idea of the subject matter of this film and it took a while into it to gather that for sure. Plenty of clues but I was never quite sure until the appearance of Old Nick.
This is an excellent film to watch in this time of ""lock-down"" for Cornavirus. Be very thankful for what we DO have :-)
Stand out performances by Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay."
" Ahh. So Refreshing To See A Good Movie Every So Often.
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,8,"Everything you've read about ""Room"" is true. That's as succinct as I can put it. Nothing was out of place here. What's especially striking is the young actor who, without a doubt, has a very fruitful future in Hollywood (unless he falls into the ""young Hollywood kids"" curse of drugs and crime like many have done). This film tugged on my heartstrings like few have been unable to, and for that alone, it's a must see."
" Gripping and thought-provoking
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,9,"The first half of the movie ""room"" is gripping and the second half is thought-provoking. Frankel talked about a victim syndrome, that is, being persecuted for a long time can lead to emotional numbness and cognitive errors. For example, they would think, ""how do you all deal with all the suffering I've suffered..."" Therefore, it is difficult to integrate into the original living environment. After all, it's more difficult to reconstruct the original world when it collapses than to return to the real environment from ignorance. That's why mom can't stand it and son is braver. That's why ""room"" is more profound than the general suspense movie. Fortunately, love is the best medicine to save everything."
" This movie is an epitome of ""ignorance is bliss"".
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,9,"The movie starts with tender and curious gestures like Jack (Jacob Tremblay) greeting inanimate objects from his Room like they were friends. It immediately immerses you into Jack's perception, and, due to the uncertainty of the first minutes of the film, the viewer is left asking what happened to these people to be disheveled and detached from the outside world. Progressively one discovers Ma's (Brie Larson) situation and can't help but feel sympathy and horror at imagining the cruel 7 years that she had to endure in that situation.The kidnapping, isolating, deprivation, impregnating, and raping depicts an almost unbearable landscape for both protagonists, only to have them build a bond that made them inseparable, and this was the bond that helped the mother survive even after escaping the confinement. The movie takes an interesting dive into Jack's phenomenology. It continually reminds you of his perception, understanding that deprivation to that level will have sometimes unimaginable effects. The story that Ma gave Jack about there not being any other place but their room is a beautiful symbol of compassion and care, a profound level of navigation of their connection and mindset that is displayed brilliantly in repeated style.The movie made me suffer, squirm, highly conflicted by the understanding of both their experience. Is there beauty in not teaching people a bout the horrible nature of the world? there is...this movie is an epitome of ""ignorance is bliss"". The issue was when to present Jack the idea of there being an infinitely complex and spacious world past the walls of his room. One of the clear lessons of the movie is that there is always functionality and benefit to abstaining from sharing some crucial information. Would you describe in detail to a paraplegic the beauty and freedom of dancing? There is always a place and a time to maximize the benefit and pleasure for anything.It is a morbid, pathologic topic, but nonetheless one that exists past the confines of our comfortable and privileged lifestyle. The movie is conducted with beauty and curiosity, like an experiment of naivety. It is the endearing feature that could be digested in such a tragic story."
" Room
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,8,"Between relative freedom and absolute freedom, movies let me see what kind of state people live in modern society. Although the change of space makes the painting style on the surface of the film suddenly change, in fact, people's response to the surroundings in different spaces has not changed, sometimes it's suppressed to make people tremble, sometimes it's melted by warmth. Love makes people safe. In order to get safety, we begin to possess, possess and destroy love."
" phenomenal performance
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,10,"The movie has a great depth and shows us about how a mother cares for her child
and how to escape our emotional disturbances . breathtaking performance from brie larson not for one moment did it seem a little bit below the best.
i noticed in the last that the kid in this movie is in good boys movie excellent acting from the kid too. worth every penny."
" Better than I thought
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,8,I didn't read the book but I really enjoyed the film. Acting is great even the kid actor was pretty good. Give this a try you won't be disappointed !
" Masterpiece
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,10,"The little boy is a natural actor. The most impressed me is not how to escape from bondage to integrate into the society, but when Jack got out of the room out of the carpet package, the eyeful of green trees and blue sky.Even the air messy wires are fascinating, beautiful under the soundtrack of the foil, instant tears, this kind of touched, is derived from the desire for freedom and grateful."
" Room with only one skylight
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,8,"An irritable woman, a little ""girl"" with very long hair, a messy room, just some food that can only be eaten. Opening a movie without reading the introduction, to be honest, I have a lot of prejudices. At that time I wondered why she didn't take her children out, why did she have to rely on that man to have food, is it not good for self-reliance? Look, without knowing it, I arbitrarily assert.
Fortunately, curiosity suppressed my irritability, wondering when she would take the child out, when she could live on her own, and continue to watch the movie with my prejudices. When I really saw the iron gate and the little skylight, I woke up. It's not that she didn't want to go out, but that she fell into real hell. The life in captivity forced her to only dream with her children. For seven years, I could not imagine how she persevered. She used her efforts to create a normal childhood for her children, using necklaces made of eggshells and patterns made of cardboard to let children read and watch TV. Finally determined to let the child understand the truth, because the child could not accept them for a while, they had a strong dispute and had a cold war for a while. Pretending to be sick, pretending to die, and constantly training, the child finally had the opportunity to be taken out of the wooden shed as a ""corpse"".
Mother kept telling the child to crawl out of the rolled blanket and jump out of the car after the car stopped. When he met the first person, he asked for help. Before the age of 5, he had never seen a third person, thinking that those on TV were fake, and everything in nature was fake, because his pet dog was also fake. When his mother tells him the truth of this world, he needs to identify the true and false of people and animated people. They were finally reborn and saved. A 17-year-old girl was imprisoned for seven years. Is such a person worthy of being called a person? In a straightforward manner, the evil in this world goes far beyond this. And the movie did not end after they were saved. Life is not the perfect ending, so it can end. In seven years, everything outside requires her to accept and adapt again. Everything around will not stop because of her disappearance, time will not stop because of her disappearance. Holding a photo album to see friends at that time, their lives are still the same, this is the biggest blow to her. I can't understand that when they were interviewed, the host repeatedly forced her to recall the past, and still questioning why she didn't release her child for freedom earlier. I have a hard time understanding how it is a fault to depend on each other to survive. In that situation, all her methods are not wrong. This is not measured by right or wrong, no one can truly empathize. The fact that the authorities are obsessed with bystanders is not just a warning to those in it. Isn't there a warning to be onlookers? It is wrong that your sobriety does not mean that the person who is truly experienced. What we lack is not only empathy, but also a sobriety of being self-righteous.
Fortunately, they finally said goodbye to the room and really came out. Maybe this shadow is difficult to erase in this life, maybe in many midnight dreams, waking up in a trance. Fortunately, they were finally saved. I thought it was just my mother who said that he was a boy in order to protect the child. As a result, he was a real boy, a brave man.
The disparity in strength has made women, children and the elderly naturally belong to the disadvantaged groups. How to protect themselves has actually been talked about a lot, but there is little education for the truly powerful. I hope that each mother can do her best to cultivate a real man, not a murderer with a decent appearance."
" Just doesn't make sense!
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,6,"She couldn't escape for 7 years?!?!? seriously?!?!?! from a simple room in a garden?!?! I mean yes I know the door is electronically locked and coded and she doesn't know the code, he forces her to look the wall everytime he wants to enter the code but man there are still plenty of other ways to escape! Why whyyyy did she wait all these years?! Just doesn't make sense!"
" I hope all women can protect themselves
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,9,"If the measure of a story's worth is the empathy you feel for the characters and the amount that you are unable to remove yourself from their circumstances, then Room succeeds by miles."
" Love is the real antidote
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,8,"When such keywords like abduction, imprisonment, and sex slave were proposed, it was generally believed that the safest way to deal with them was to render a tragic atmosphere and use a realistic lens to tell the story that the protagonist falls from freedom to the abyss and then escape hard.
But this movie chose a difficult path. The tragedy factor is only used as the background of the story. The focus is on how the mother and child escaped the room where the flesh and the soul were imprisoned.
In my view, the real theme of the film is that, with the support and help of the loved one, even in this tortured tragedy, human beings can become stronger and live a wonderful life."
" The story of salvation or trauma itself is cliché
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,9,"The story of salvation or trauma itself is cliché. The outstanding thing is the display of the world of the child's experience. We all had the unique time and space of the transcendental empiricism, but were eventually replaced by the single world of this symbol. Someone bid farewell tenderly. Someone did not say goodbye to anyone or even forgot its existence. The problem is not that the world liberated the room, but that we should extend the room to the world, if this is really Deleuze's century."

" ROOM (2015) - 17/03/2020
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,8,"Fantastic acting and a great script make this one of the most unusual films of recent years. One shouldn't spoil too much about the plot, but it says a lot that a film can easily have it's climax in the middle of the story and still lose no intensity in the second half, easily keeping the audience's attention for the aftermath. Engaging, moving and honest.Mitchell Bulfin"
" Truely heartbreaking, a horror told as a drama
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,10,"I like a lot about this movie, and I think a lot of people should see it so I'll keep this brief.They made a lot of smart directorial choices with this film. The story of the movie could have very easily been told in the horror genre, and I feel that I have seen that many times. Being told as a drama instead, this felt first hand and personal. They put very little focus on the villain, and told the story from the perspective of the child. I like that they give no real screen time to him, taking the romanticizing out of the equation. It's heartbreaking to see how the boy who has very little world knowledge and mental maturity handles dark subject matter like rape, kidnapping, mental and physicsl abuse.I love the that by the halfway mark, they focus on reintroducing the child to normal society. Most movies would choose to end after the main characters escape their captor. I like that this movie took a psychological approach to the aftermath that this kind of abuse would cause. In a lot of movies, the big climax is defeating the villain and the movie ends and we are meant to believe it's happily ever after. This movie showed the dark, hard life of someone who survived true horrors and how the pain never really ends.This movie will make you cry. It's very powerful and important."
" Exceptional in all aspects.
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,10,"This movie had me glued to the screen. Performances are fantastic, it's astounding how realistic the dialogue and interactions are, even in such specific and tragically atypical circumstances. Definitely recommend"
" Room For Improvement
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,7,"To be honest this film wasn't too bad, the acting was really good and I quite like films that have a ""2 part"" feel to them. It just lacked a little something but I'm not sure what ?If you suffer from Misophonia like me just a warning, two characters eat cereal and decide that's the best time to talk , so you might want to skip that partAnd final critique, The Mother could easily have escaped the ""room"" through the skylight or even through the wall which was made of wood!But I'm being picky , give it a go"
" Exceptional, breathtaking

" A Profoundly Intimate Experience
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,10,A story about a boy and his mother locked up in a room for a number of years and their subsequent troubles adapting to the real world. It is incredibly well acted and cast. The focal point of the movie being Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay with their flawless performances and great on screen chemistry. It is a very intimate story that creeps up on you and leaving you pondering for days. The movie refuses to use cheap emotional tricks or graphic violence or scares to draw you in. It slowly builds up the relationship between the two main characters making you invested in their story and their future by trying to show a terrifying event happening to real people as well as the struggles they face in its aftermath.
" Love
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,9,"The little boy is the real leading role. The whole movie story stands on the victim's point of view and pursue psychological help. The stolen years, wounded lives, and the imprisoned soul will be saved by hope and goodwill. Live a good life. Because only living will have new hope. Try to feel good, but also try to see a bigger world. Love will save the all."
" Amazing story
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,10,From the first minute till the last i was amazed by this movie and the story. The way it has been given form is amazing and the psychological ststement it wants to show the audience are remarable
" Was emotional and beautiful
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,8,"The film is boring at first, but then it becomes compelling and in the end it was pleasant to see."
" A light in the darkness
",2020-03-19 00:00:00,10,"You are my world in the room, and you will not be afraid to leave the room, because we are still together ... This sentence is said by the child, but it is also applicable to the mother. It can even be said that the child actually saved the mother! From the child's point of view, the film seems easy to accept, but it is more cruel, and the boy's monologue has a lot of tears."
" Little thoughts
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,10,"For Jack, who was born in a room, the room is the whole of the world, so it can extend infinitely from all directions. This world is not good or bad because there is no comparison. The outside world does not mean anything more. On the contrary, it is only possible. Is less secure. For Joey, does going out mean that she wants the freedom, why in the room she and Jack depend on each other, and live to go out, waiting until she really goes out, but with the freedom she yearns to return, but ca n't Adapt to suicide."
" Don't adjust your TV sets, when you see a blank screen
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,4,"This is not a new story. One would have come across reports in the media of similar incidents in real life. However, if you are one who believes a movie is a medium that provides a unique visual experience, you would be disappointed.
For almost 50% of the duration of the movie, you wouldn't miss a thing even if you remained seated with your eyes shut because everything is dark. For some uncanny reason, such movies win critical acclaim but fail to entertain normal movie lovers. Only critics can see the emperor's new clothes, may be.
This movie is more of a sound track. Why anyone should have attempted to make a 'blank-screen movie' may remain a mystery that only a Hercule Poirot could solve.
Of course the pretentious critic would say that it represented the dark nature of the theme. I would ask such people to watch a John Alton classic to know how one can create beauty out of darkness and shadows
It may have been a clever way out for a lazy director who wanted to save time taken for adjusting the light for each shot. A smart way would have been to reduce the run time because the film moves at a painful pace from the beginning. An average director could have wound it up in less than 90 minutes.
If you want to see how a parent keeps a child protected and motivated in the most challenging circumstances, watch 'Life is Beautiful'"
" it made me remember my very first home :')
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,9,"Our mind is one fascinating organ .. it stores memories deep down somewhere only to resurface them ever so slightly with that smell you seem to recognize or that song you used to hear or that color pattern which resembled like the kaleidoscope you had as a child or your first home where you were born and raised as a kid.
This movie made me remember so many things I had somehow forgotten of the best time of my life. No I wasn't put in a room but I had a way of talking to the non living things .. telling them stories and caring for them as if they were living beings. And there were countless moments that I could somehow recall.Well, about this movie .. the less that is said the better as it is a journey to experience yourself. Everything about Room was absolutely brilliant.
The first phase where the focus was on something else and then the 2nd where the story turned course altogether to a different issue. It is so good that it is unsettling but it still carries a lot of innocence.I think if you are ready to go for a emotional journey .. this, right here, is the movie to watch.
It will make you believe that courage has no appearance.
It will make you think that we take small small things for granted which we should be grateful about.
It will make you wonder what a great movie it is."
" Room - a beautiful movie
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,10,"Room is a deeply psychological film about a mother, Joy, and her 5 year-old son, Jack, who grew up locked in a 10x10 shed, never seeing the outside world.
The first part of the movie walks us through their daily lives in the room, as well as some special situations, such as Jack's 5th birthday, arguments between Joy and Jack, and Joy's struggle to explain that there is more to the world than the room they live in.
The film excels at portraying the frustration that comes with trying to explain such concepts to a child who has only ever seen trees and animals on an old TV. Brie Larson's performance is outstanding.
Room climaxes with a successful escape plan in which Jack plays dead and fools Old Nick into taking him outside, where he manages to come in contact with a helpful man who calls the police. One of the officers patiently questions the child and finally frees Joy from the shed. The reunion scene between Joy and Jack is one of my favorites. The sheer relief on Joy's face as she realizes that they are finally free is priceless.
The story then continues with Joy trying to reintegrate in society and with Jack adjusting to an immense new world. This is a highly unusual situation, considering that most kids get to know the world as they grow up. It is hard for Jack to comprehend his environment, fact which makes him wish to return to the shed.
The film realistically portrays Joy's exhaustion and sadness about Jack's reactions but also never gives the impression that all hope is lost.
Room is definitely one of the most beautiful movies I have seen recently."
" A bit overrated
",2020-03-09 00:00:00,6,"It starts off really good but quickly slows down and gets a bit boring. The second half is mostly awkward silences and people staring into nothingness.
Dialogue doesn't sound natural at all and people don't react the way normal people would. It feels forced."
" You can just turn off the movie after the first hour
",2020-03-09 00:00:00,3,Nothing really happens after that. There is no point to keep watching after they get out of the room.
" Wow.
",2020-03-01 00:00:00,10,This movie is haunting. I cried so many times watching this film. The cast did an amazing job making you feel their emotions.
" HEARTFELT.
",2020-02-28 00:00:00,9,"Both Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay were heartbreakingly amazing in this movie. It's an emotionally powerful journey that has a lot to say about motherhood, courage, and PTSD. Well done."
" The acting is phenomenal!
",2020-02-22 00:00:00,8,"Marvelous film. Captivating plot filled with mountains of emotions. Brie Larson's performance in this film was breathtaking. Her emotions, facial expressions and tones were perfectly done, which is one of the main reasons why this was such an incredible film. Jacob Tremblay's performance was also amazing."
" Loved it
",2020-02-19 00:00:00,8,"In this emotional takeover a young mama and her son are imprisoned for years by her baby-daddy who kidnapped her and kept her for sex even after he got her pregnant. Where they are imprisoned isn't important as it's the relationship between them and how the mother tries to build a world for her child where it's ok that they are the only two people he knows (except for the kidnapper's visits from which he hides) and this is the only place he knows. Next it is important how she builds him up to be able to go out into the world alone. These are the things that make this movie something to watch, not logistics. The second act is a little weak yes, and mores the pity but that doesn't detract from the set up."
" Oscar-worthy performance
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,8,"If I ever met Brie, I'd shake her hand and offer honest advice: Do more of these films. She's stepping down by being with Marvel Cinematic Universe. This is her genre. Go the Meryl Streep route. Since I won't meet her, let me say that this is a well written screenplay. I read what she did to prepare for this role and it paid off. That boy did very well. This is a good movie."
" A cinematic masterpiece!
",2020-02-08 00:00:00,10,"One of the most beautiful films I have ever had the good fortune to see; cannot recommend enough. Incredible performances from everyone involved; particularly of course from Jacob Tremblay (the best child actor you're likely to see in anything) and Brie Larson who is great in anything she's been in and truly astounding in this. Full of absolutely heart-wrenching moments and yet ultimately positively life-affirming, Lenny Abrahamson and Emma Donoghue have written and directed a true masterpiece. There is a certain sequence in the middle of the film that left me breathless and an emotional wreck! Cried the first time watching and as soon as I started watching the film again, started tearing up as soon as it started. A beautiful film about a mother and a son that will be cherished!"
" good stuff
",2020-02-06 00:00:00,7,"I actually didnt mind the kid, and that sure is something. so yea, performances were pretty on point. story kept me interested, and sound and camerawork were decent.7/10: pretty good"
" One of the best movie I ever saw.
",2020-02-05 00:00:00,10,"Ma ( or Joy) is a woman who was abducted seven years ago who's still held captive in a really small but furnished shed along with her son, Jack, who just turned five. They don't have acces to the outside world but at least the 10x10 box of a living space that they share has a small skylight that allows some semblance of nature to enter. For Ma, this is a prison, but for Jack, who has never known any other environment, the room represents reality in its totality...One of the best things about ""Room"" is how such an intimate film manages to raise some big questions. Like... What is real and what is not? What do we really need to live? What defines us as a person?It reallly not an easy movie to watch, there were moments that were so intense that I barely breathed, but it's so authentic and beautiful and unique and emotional... 10/10 for sure."

" Survival at all costs.
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,9,"An intense and intriguingly original story about survival and learning about the world for the very first time through the eyes of a five-year-old boy. The depth of the character's stunted mental and emotional development was definitely the most unique aspect, followed closely by the characterization of the ""Room""."
" Amazing
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,10,I think Its a must see. The acting is incredible. I wasnt expecting such a good movie.
" Disturbing and great film making.
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,8,Disturbing and great film making. Might be hard you some people to watch.
" Captured and Taken !
",2020-01-22 00:00:00,10,"In our culture and era we live in, we hear about rape and kidnappings way too often. I bet anyone I would ask would know of someone whos been sexually harassed or has been themselves. This is a sad and harsh reality we live in but nobody knows what happens behind the scenes and ""Room"" really encaptures what happens in real life. This film is very raw and hard to watch at times. But that's honestly why I liked it so much. The director of ""Room"", Lenny Abrahanson did a great job at capturing realism in his film and didn't sugar coat it.This film starts in 'room' where Ma (Brie Larson) and her five year old son Jack, (Jacob Trebley). Jack calmly talks about how Ma would cry and watch tv like a zombie all day before Jack ""zoomed down from heaven through skylight, into room"" (1:44). When Jack turns five, they bake a cake and talk about what a big boy he is now that he's five. Ma has decides to tell him the truth about why they are stuck in 'room' and that there's a whole world outside of room that jack has never seen before. Now that he's old, she trusts that he's ready for the truth. After telling him this, he is in disbelief and does not believe what she's saying for one second. Jack has been comfortable in 'room' since the beginning and has trouble understanding why ma would want to leave. Jack enjoys his routine and his ""friends"" there ( he was friends with a mouse who came in occasionally, the rug, the table, the bath etc). Ma decides they were getting out and to do that she thought she would pretend jack had died from being so sick so he could be taken outside of room and could run to someone, anyone for help and to tell the police the situation. Even after the escape however, things didn't go as smoothly as one may think for being released from a seven year prison sentence.This film really caught my eye considering the context. This is a dark film that shows a very raw description of what it could be like to be captured and held by a sick old man. Going into the film, I thought I knew how it would go. Show their life in 'room', have a few failed escape attempts, finally get out, then reunite with family. I was happily surprised with how much different the film actually was from what I expected. Lenny Abrahanson did a well job on making the film realistic as well as making it unexpected. The camera angles used in the making of the film truly enhanced the darkness of the film. The lighting also went along with camera angles, since they only had one window, which was a skylight they had to use that as basically their only light source besides some lamps and the lighting helped portray the eeriness of the film. Especially once they finally get out into the world again, it is immensely bright. Jack, (Jacob Trebley) is a very convincing five year old boy in this film. He is a main character and his acting really helped convince the audience of his fear and sadness. Ma, (Brie Larson) also is very key in making this a convincing film. Ma has to portray someone who has been locked up by a sick man for seven years and has to show the pain through her actions and words and I believe she does an excellent job with that in this film. However, one thing I didn't enjoy in this film was that it lacked voicing of what Ma and Jack were feeling after they got out. There was some emotion showed but Ma didn't speak to it as much as I thought she would have. Jack's only true emotion after the escape, was that he missed 'room' and wanted to go back. He quickly got over that and became a much happier boy but he also didn't comprehend what he and his mother went through. Ma did show some feelings after escaping, through her actions. She tries to end her life since she knows now that Jack can be cared for. But it took her some realizing that she needed to be on this earth and take care of her son.This heart breaking story thankfully turns into a very powerful and strong message. I would recommend this to anyone who likes dark thrillers or if you enjoy films based off real life events then I would definitely suggest this for you. I give ""Room"" an overall rating of 5/5."
" A new world after 5 years
",2020-01-18 00:00:00,7,The boy experiences the world after 5 years being in a captive room. The movie was different from other movie and the boy done great acting.
" Very intense heart breaking and joyful.
",2020-01-18 00:00:00,8,One of those movies where I actually think Brie Larson is good. Very sad but great movie to watch and Jacob Trembly well done.
" This one gonna stick with me so so long
",2020-01-12 00:00:00,10,"One of the best story which beautifully got told. The story connect with people perfectly, you gonna loved this. Eternally grateful for this story is being told through this movie."
" Very mediocre at best.
",2020-01-10 00:00:00,4,"How did Brie Larson get an Oscar for this?! She didn't even do that much. The screen time manly went to the kid playing Jack. Idk, but Brie's parts didn't seem whole. It came across as the parts had been cut, a lot!The story itself is something horrible and is still happening everyday in this world. However, I didn't shed a tear once!! And I can get very! emotional ...The kid playing Jack did a pretty fantastic job with the script he got. But overacting got quite annoying a couple of times- the director's fault though.I wouldn't watch it. It is extremely mediocre."
" Brie Cheese
",2020-01-09 00:00:00,1,"She didn't deserve the Oscar.
Absolutely not!
Also didn't deserve the role as captain marvel.
PeriodT."
" Awesome story

" Horror story in the form of a drama
",2020-01-05 00:00:00,8,"Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay play Ma and Jack, a young woman and her son. Ma has been locked up in a tiny room for seven years, Jack his entire life, for he was born there. But as Jack turns five and his curiosity starts to grow, Ma decides to attempt yet another escape.The first half of this film is chilling. To live in such a closeted space, with only the barest of necessities. Never feeling the wind on your face, barely even seeing the sun. With only one other person for company. Their kidnapper should not be counted. And what makes it even more chilling is the fact that it's told from Jack's point of view, who of course treats it as completely natural. He quite literally doesn't know anything else.Powerful premise, given even more strength by the performances of Larson and Tremblay. Larson quite deservedly collected an Academy Award for this role, but I have to praise Tremblay as well. He sells his character beautifully, even though Jack's upbringing is about as far from normal as is possible. But in Tremblay's hands Jack's humanity shines through.If I had to name a flaw, I really shouldn't, but if you were to force my hand, I'd say that the second half of the film lost something. It was still chilling, but more as a mundane drama. It ceased to be otherworldly and barely conceivable, becoming a story of mother and son trying to live. Which is still good cinema, but not quite as intriguing.Nevertheless, one of the best dramas I've seen in recent years and well worth its praise."
" Started amazing..ended weak
",2019-12-25 00:00:00,6,"I gave this 6 stars just because up until the point that they escape, this film had me on the edge of my seat! Started off with so much promise. Once they manage to escape and the police rescue them, it all goes downhill.Quite frankly, there was WAY too much focus on the little boy and him readjusting to the real world. Also quite repetitive- we get it, ""room"" is all he knows. I would have much preferred they take more of an adult/mature angle to it and show us what happened to the abductor, what kind of headspace the mother was in that lead to her suicide attempt, etc. Not saying they needed to cut out the little boy completely but it should have been 50/50 at least, it just felt like the little boy show during the second half! If not for the captivating first half, I would only give it 4 stars."
" Room is filled with profound and humane feeling
",2019-12-16 00:00:00,10,Room plays as a sort of metaphor for the world which we live and Jack is a personification of our naïveté and curiosity lying in us to know it until eternity.
" great story it will touch your soul in a harmfull way
",2019-12-11 00:00:00,9,"I think that this movie have a amazing story and have been made perfectly
it had some Goofs but i recommend watching it
if you wanna watch this movie please PAY ATTENTION TO DIALOGUES they are amazing"
" Traumatic and sad experience and incredible performances from Brie Larson and Jacob Trembly
",2019-12-06 00:00:00,9,"The 2nd and 3rd acts were amazing in every aspect, the perfomances storrytelling,trauma,saddeness were on the edge during the whole movie ,mainly in 2nd and 3rd act cause more characters come in the escape plan was brilliant with Jacob's performance, now u might ask yourself why i didnt give it a 9 now its because a perfect movie for me is one that has no flaws even if there is a small one i would call it ""perfect"". the only flaw in Room is the voice over that Jacob does many time during the film, maybe like 5 times, which is quite many in mind that i am here to watch a story no a documentry."
" What a Story!!!!!!!!
",2019-12-03 00:00:00,10,"After watching this movie, I became a fan of Jacob Tremble. What a fantastic story and all the actors performance. I must say that such a movie is not made again and again. I liked the intensity of the story."
" Amazing Plot with a little downside
",2019-12-02 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed watching this movie characterizing a horrific real-world problem. I could literally imagine living like them and realizing how I'd feel like being suffocated in this situation. However, characterizing a little struggle or escape plan in the past 7 years from ""Ma"" would exhibit a better sense of hope and want of freedom."
" piece of art
",2019-11-28 00:00:00,10,"A masterpiece of all standards, I enjoyed the film a great performance and a good choice for all actors and director creativity, the truth I see the film of the year 2015"
" Brilliant, but very uncomfortable. See life in the perspective of a 5 year old boy.
",2019-11-21 00:00:00,6,"The film opens up into a very strange and unsettling scenery. A Mother and her boy, locked into a ROOM. Ma (Brie Larson) is with him and their endless days consist of cooking, reading, and watching TV where Jack is told that what he sees on the screen is not real, only pretend. All he knows of the world is what he sees in front of his eyes. Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) brings food and other household items but when he comes, Jack has to hide in his wardrobe, out of sight.Jack is the focus of the film and we see everything from his point of view, with the help of his sometime narration but we can also get into his mother's mind and feel her pain and live her dreams.A heartfelt film, but not really super inventive. Strong story, strong actors, sad mood. I loved that we as the audience were able to experience the world through the eyes of the boy: the tight room, the sad eyes of his mother, the exploration of the world around him after they escaped. Strong, but would not rewatch it."
" Amazing!!!!
",2019-11-19 00:00:00,10,Impressive movie! Jacob Tremblay deserves all the awards! He is so talented! I am amazed by his performance.
" Well worth watching
",2019-11-12 00:00:00,9,Finally got a chance to see this amazing film. This will contain some spoilers. The film is great I didn't read the caption before getting started so when everything made sense what was going one took a moment for me. I was under the impression it was an apocalyptic film but found out the sad truth it was a post rape film.The film was well written and the emotions the characters are going through makes total sense. I think I haven't been more impressed with any actor as the young kid (Jacob Tremblay) he was amazing. I didn't think at first the kid was a boy and thought he was actually a girl that the mother was hiding from the rapist.The film has so much emotions from the time the kid finally jumps out of the car to Joy trying to kill herself. I'll say it again the actors were amazing. It is safe to say seeing where they went from The Room makes sense. I have recommended this film to so many and everyone who see's it loves it.
" Wonderful, heartbreaking, beautiful, sad and happy movie
",2019-11-06 00:00:00,9,"Some Oscars are so well deserved they should be handed out twice. Brie Larsons performance in this movie is one of those times.
All the acting in this movie is amazing, but Brie is the stand out star for sure. The story sad but sort of happy-ish at the same time. The movie is heartbreaking, but also beautiful and wonderful.This movie is brilliantly done and I would probably rank it among the top 25-30 best movies of all time. With that said I am not sure this is for everyone. This is very emotional and it is about the acting. In other words if all you want is to be entertained by action and one-liners this is most likely not for you.I give it a 9/10. I would like to go higher, but the movie is not 10/10 perfect, I would say its 9.4/10 or so.A must see!"
" Would have been more interesting if Brie could act
",2019-11-05 00:00:00,3,"This is a sad, hard to watch film with difficult subject matter. Brie seems to be drawn to these with alcoholics or abductions -- dark stuff. Unfortunately, she doesn't have the range or acting chops to pull it off. Watching her ""act"" is like watching paint dry. She should have stuck to her bit parts where she didn't have to say much, just look pretty in a bikini. The child in the film steals every scene they share. Also, so depressing. I can't recommend it."
" Best drama movie ever made
",2019-10-29 00:00:00,10,"I am soooo bored of all  they release each year. All the false automated account bumping the rating of poor empty movies made by big name. This movie deserve the top place in the IMDB best movies ever made just behind if not before The Godfather. This movie proves you don't need money at all to make a masterpiece. For those who never saw the movie just don't read anything about it. Forget all the description, trailers or interviews made. You need to start the movie without knowing what is going on. I promise this gonna be a blast."
" Outstanding performance by Jacob Treblay
",2019-10-27 00:00:00,10,"Outstanding performance by Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay.Director done a good job capture the audience heart.Its show everything in two.inside and outside room, before and after being freed,before and after having baby...... Can't believe Jacob Treblay is the same boy from the Good boys movie.give me back my Jacob Treblay from the room.lol"
" Headline
",2019-10-21 00:00:00,7,"The novel is not only about the days in the room and the escape from it but how to face and adapt the society, how to face the doubt from the public opinion and how to relive their lives. What the film can express is limited. I had tears in my eyes while I was watching the movie. It is immersive. But the darker things written in the novel, although they escaped they still had to face complex societies, and even the cruel reality that the victims are still subject to moral doubts does not show much. That the film focused more on the child at last is cured but also weakened the intensity. I felt a little pity about this. It's a good thing that we have a movie that tells the public a story like this. However, the parts that need the public to reflect the most, how they live their lives after the escape, is expressed vaguely."
" So Damn Good
",2019-10-21 00:00:00,10,I had constant chills for a good five minutes when Jacob Tremblay unraveled himself out of the carpet and touched grass for the first time and Larson was fantastic of course.
" Stays with you
",2019-10-17 00:00:00,7,"This was well done, a movie that has stayed with me for days afterwards, much as the book did. Cleverly done screenplay here which must have been hard to write. The story follows a woman only known as Ma and her 5 year old son who live in a small room. It is the only life Jack has ever known. They play games, Ma tells Jack stories. She is often depressed, Jack is bored and full of questions. Eventually the viewer realizes that Ma is being held captive in this enclosed space, Old Nick comes for his rape visits and Jack hides in the wardrobe. Ma has been here for 7 years. The story is hard to watch.They finally gain their freedom and Jack is able to experience the outside world for the first time. Interesting details brought up you wouldn't think about; like the kid can't do stairs, never seen the sun or real daylight, never been alone, or exposed to germs. Jacob Tremblay is amazing throughout Brie Larson shines in the second half, finally breaking down when she is safe and can relax enough to let herself go at her mother's house.
William H Macy (with top billing) is in this for about a second as the dad who can't look at her."
" Heart wrenching but brilliant
",2019-10-07 00:00:00,9,"I've been on IMDb for 13 years and have never felt the need to leave a review, even of my personal favourite films, but having finally got round to seeing Room I was compelled to come on here and encourage others to do the same.The performances are suburb and with the emotion the story itself conveys alongside this film grabs you by the heart and squeezes from the get-go. I found myself literally on the edge of the sofa halfway through, talking to and encouraging Jack during a pivotal moment of the film.I won't be watching this again any time soon, not because it isn't utterly brilliant but because I just don't think I'd be able to take the emotional punch it dishes out another time.Final word has to go to Jacob Trembley, who I think puts in the best acting performance by a child I have ever seen."
" A story of love and freedom
",2019-10-06 00:00:00,10,"Room is a 2015 movie directed by Lenny Abrahamson, in which the two main characters are acted by Brie Larson e Jacob Tremblay.
It has a dramatic genre at first, but secondly it becomes a thriller movie.
Joy (called by her son ""Ma"") and her five-year-old son Jack live in a shed that they call ""Room"" where have a bed, a toilet, a bathtub, a television, and a kitchen...but with only one window. They are captives of a man who is called Old Nick (Jack's father) .He abducted Joy seven years ago, and normally rapes her while Jack is hidden in the wardrobe. Jack believes that only Room and what in it are ""real,"" and the rest of the world exists only in television.
When Joy discovers that Old Nick lost his job, she's afraid he'll abandon the house, letting them die without food or water. She thinks about a plan to escape: Jack will pretend to be dead and get rolled up in Rug so Old Nick will bury Jack far from the house. In this case ,Jack can escape when Old Nick stops at a stop sign.
Jack's innocence and sweetness, Joy's strong hope to get out of ""Room"" and continue living the life that Old Nick has stolen from her, make this movie painful to watch; especially thanks to actors' excellent skills in acting."
" Stepped Into the Wrong Room!
",2019-10-03 00:00:00,6,"I can appreciate all the critical love for Room, even if I can't agree with it.What I can subscribe to, is that the film is anchored by two wonderful central performances from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay.And though I haven't read Emily Donoghue's adapted novel, I applaud director Lenny Abrahamson's reported decision to upgrade Ma's role for the screen version. For me, it's the complex character of Ma/Joy that holds major interest, rather than 5 year old Jack, through whose perspective we view much of the action. We are told very early on in the second of two clearly defined halves of Room, that young Jacob is resilient and very likely to shake off the effects of 5 years of confinement with his mother. We (at least me anyway) don't need huge amounts of onscreen time devoted to watching Jack atune to his new environment. It's here the film really falls down, with a now plodding pace, as Ma disappears from the screen for very large tracts of time.Of far more importance and interest was exploring the more edgy personality of Ma and the vast challenges, which are really only paid lip service, on her repatriation from capture. A bit of a spat with her mum and a testy TV interview and all of a sudden Joy disappears for way too much of the second half, when things were just starting to get interesting.Without turning Room into a police procedural, I think the movie could have spent a little more time following up the arrest (and likely conviction) of Old Nick. His character generates much of the suspense and he goes virtually unreferenced in the film's second half. In fact the only indirect link is when Ma and Jack return to the room with the police at the end of the film. It looks so ramshackle and flimsy, that even I found myself wondering how Joy had not really managed to create any other escape attempts. It just didn't have the appearance of a virtual escape-proof cell.Room is an unconventional and very professionally produced vehicle about a none too uncommon issue which has affected many women and children over the years. But for me any thriller/suspense elements disappeared when characters such as Ma and Old Nick were off screen, so as to allow an unfettered, somewhat repetitive look at Jack, adjusting to his brave, new world."
" The worst movie
",2019-09-27 00:00:00,1,The worst movie I've ever seen! I never recommend to somebody else... It was very very very boring movie!
" Jacob Tremblay gives one of the finest child performances of all time.
",2019-09-20 00:00:00,10,"There is a lot to admire about this film. The direction in the first hour and the final minutes, especially gets the most out of the concept and manages to make a 10 by 10 foot space seem like everything and eventually nothing. Likewise, the direction leaves much of the horror to the imagination and it is all the more chilling as a result. The screenplay is sparse and spartan in the way real life is around such horrific events. I like that several of the tensions in the story, i.e. grandfather's inability to deal with his grandson, are left unresolved. Finally Larson gives one hell of an understated, yet raw, performance that elevates the already strong material.But much credit has to be given to Jacob Tremblay as well as the director for producing one of the finest, if not the finest, child performances of all time. I haven't seen a child actor as natural and real since at least Justin Henry in Kramer vs Kramer 40+ years ago. Tremblay has no artifice or pretension at all. Jack isn't cloying and so much of the emotional power comes from that character. It would be a remarkable performance no matter what but Jack is a hard character to play. Strictly speaking, Jack is the protagonist and it is his story-the movie at its core is a coming of age tale (abet a messed up one). The scenario that Jack is in is just hard for any person to really sell, let alone a child actor. It is a very good performance.This is a good movie. It is hopeful in the end but it is intense."
" Masterpiece
",2019-09-11 00:00:00,10,"The performance of Brie Larson was great. And it is a shame that Jacob Tremblay didn't get an oscar for his performance. He really deserved more credits. If his acting wasn't so good, the acting of brie larson wouldn't have such an impact."
" An amazing movie with so many things to appreciate.
",2019-09-04 00:00:00,10,"I didn't watch the trailer, so I never knew what exactly was going on. So when I started watching the movie, I was genuinely surprised and shocked with the circumstances that these characters had to go through, along with how deep and emotional this movie was. The film was able to do so much skill from the director and being able to bring a heavy hitting emotional film.I really liked how the film allowed us to be in the perspective of the child and to see the world from his point of view. You can tell from where they were that something is off about the room the mom and Jack were living in; especially with how cramped and dirty it looked. However, as we see it in his perspective, we understand that since this was the only thing that he knows, we see the beauty and the enjoyment that he has in that small place. Even when they escape the room, you see everything in a new light as we are in Jack's shoes and a simple room in a hospital will look heavenly. You see everything as if you are seeing it for the first time and this is what the director was able to do very well. The cinematography and the overall structure of the scene works perfectly well, allowing us to be in his shoes and to be amazed with the boy.This is not an easy film to sit through due to the bleakness and how daunting what the mother and son had gone through, along with her parents can be. This film provides so much depth and emotion to all of the characters and I cannot help but give praise for what this film was able to accomplish. As the mom and her son was able to get out of their room, I really loved that we get to see how something like this can ruin people emotionally and that things do not end happily so soon. We usually see the family become happy and the characters who had gone through trauma will miraculously get over it. But this film doesn't do that as it dives deeper into the turmoil of what had happened. The main character is going through some emotional distraint, the boy is struggling to understand the new reality he has entered and we see that the parents of the main character also have to struggle to deal with their new reality. Despite all of this, not everything is a disaster as there were moments of enjoyment and happiness that had me tearing up. Which is another reason why I loved this movie. The film perfectly combines the darkness with the heartfelt moments well, adding more emotional element to the overall story.Every character here goes through so much and this is all due to the performances. Brie Larson was absolutely amazing as Jack's mom. She has to carry part of the film and the emotion that she was able to deliver was just great. I really liked that we get to see that even after it is over, things won't go back as they were before and you see the inner turmoil that she goes through. She did deserve every praise and awards she has received for this film based on what she brought to this movie. Also, even at a young age, Jacob Tremblay gave such a fantastic performance. Just like with Larson, he provided a lot of depth and emotion to the character as he also has to carry the film and based on his performance alone. I was able to buy that he knew nothing outside of the room he stayed in and that he is totally oblivious to the world around him. You also have great performances from Joan Allen, William H. Macy and Tom McCamus, whom I really liked, especially with what he does in the film.Even watching it a second time, the emotion and the tension that I felt, the connection I felt with these characters and crying non stop in some of the more emotional scenes really made me appreciate this film and consider this as one of my favorite films of all time."
" Emotionally intense
",2019-09-04 00:00:00,8,"I've always liked Brie Larson and I wanted to see this movie, but I waited for a long time because I knew it would be emotionally gripping. I was scared and horrified for the characters. Having a background in Psychology and worked closely with 5-year-olds, I had what I think was a unique perspective, and it made the movie all the more intense for me. It was fantastically created."
" All of us came from a window in the rooftop
",2019-08-21 00:00:00,8,"""Room"" isn't just a film about a rape; it is a film about the dialectic of experience of the world, about the perception of reality. Surely the dramatic case of a woman kept in a room for years, and raped, especially if we think that's a real story, creates empathetic feelings for us; but this point is also a way to explore how a kid - taken just as a new born human being - can build his own mythology basing his considerations on what he can find in his world, that's simply a microscopic room. After the exit the difficulty to consolidate human relationships demonstrates the delicate period of exploration of another world that doesn't necessarily coincide with the first one. A movie that mix psychological topics (the strange relationship between mother and son outside their constricted but familiar world) with metaphysical questions about origin and kantian demands about perception of reality. Amazing."
" Amazing
",2019-08-18 00:00:00,10,"Powerful and moving! Larson puts on the most impressive performance I've ever seen, and Tremblay is not far behind. It shows how a mother and son's relationship can be pushed to the limits when necessary. A must see!"
" Eye opening
",2019-08-11 00:00:00,10,A brilliant and heart wrenching portrayal of all the news reports and documentaries we watch. Pulls on the heartstrings and puts you in the position of the victim.
" Brie
",2019-08-11 00:00:00,10,"Brie Larson was Amazing, so brillant.. i was wondring if with that performance we can get an oscar, when i made a research, i found that it was already wone. ONE OF THE BESTS EVER"
" Sad, destructive but beautiful
",2019-08-06 00:00:00,8,"I didn't expect less from Lenny Abrahamson. He made one of my favorite movies of all time. And with ROOM he just creates a movie that feels so alive, a movie which connected you with each character. The room is really a hard to watch movie, but there is the magic all the things that happen to our protagonists makes you feel there with them. Thinking what would happen if you were there. What would you do different. Jacob Tremblay just nailed it as Jack and with some quotes that makes you chills. For me the movie was trying to be sad and there is always something bad happen in the movie and that's the part that I didn't enjoy. It feels forced. But overall is a good and sad movie to watch."

" I DID NOT KIDNAP HER, I DID NAAT. OH HI JACK
",2019-08-06 00:00:00,6,"This is one of those melodramatic tearjerker flicks, but the execution was great. Brie Larson showed good range, and the kid was impressive as well. The creepy guy did a good job at being creepy. The cinematography was claustrophobic during the first half, and highlighted the beauty of the outside world in the second. I liked the small scene of the grandfather not being able to look at Jack; the child of the monster who kidnapped his daughter. It felt authentic. The concept for the film is the real winner, but there's something to be said for the execution as well. It was touching, I reccomend it."
" this movie touched me like no other movie before
",2019-07-23 00:00:00,10,"Maybe because I had a dramatic childhood (not as dramatic as the one in the movie) I emerged with this movie ... after the movie ended, I felt like some dark blockage from dark childhood was detached from me .. I felt free like never before 🙏"
" I watched the movie in a room that I imagined myself at, for 5 years !
",2019-07-22 00:00:00,10,"First of all I'll thank the one who recommended this movie to me and I'll keep recommending it to every single person I meet. I watched the movie with my cousin in a small comfort room and when the movie ended we started a discussion of imagining ourselves living in this place for 5 years just like they did, with few stuff to eat and live with. This would be very dramatic and horrible.P.S. don't forget a tissue box beside you during the movie. Have fun!"
" Masterpiece
",2019-07-21 00:00:00,8,After seeing that Brie won an Oscar for this film I wanted to watch it and I can safely say she earned it with her acting. Notably Jacob Tremblay also had a fantastic performance. The cinematography was expert level and the unique story is really a refreshing change up to the majority of other films.
" Powerful premise, but disappointing execution
",2019-07-12 00:00:00,4,"This film's premise is soul-crushingly powerful. Hearing about the similar real-life cases in Austria like Natascha Kampusch and Josef Fritzl was incredibly devastating, and honestly even quite hard to believe. If events like this didn't indeed happen in reality, the film would arguably be labelled as ""absurdly unbelievable"". But shockingly this does have a very real backing. The writer's decision to keep this fictional was respectable; truly basing this on a real story or person would not be very tactful and may come off as trivializing the trauma of the victims.There is much gained from the premise alone, especially one as relatively unexplored as this one is. However, executionally there were so many problems that the premise shines as all this film really has. As powerful as it may be, it cannot save poor acting, narrative, direction, and even story. In fact, these elements even mitigated the brutal power that stems from the premise.The mom played by Brie Larson is the key actress we see the most in the entire movie, and unfortunately her acting was awful enough that it was tough to actually bear any semblance of sympathy for her character. Her crying was not believable, and that's an important one to get right for this kind of role. Otherwise she mostly came off as just annoying. The kid was mostly annoying and very spoiled too. Perhaps this was somewhat intentional: after being trapped for 7 years, one is not exactly going to be a testament to human behavior, especially not a child. But it did make it tough to garner any true sympathy for the characters. The actors who did a great job in this film were the female police officer and all 3 grandparents (including the creepy stepdad), but they weren't major enough to make much of an impact.Without sympathy as a forefront, it begs the question: What is the narrative of this film? Emma Donoghue seemed to just hang back and portray some snippets out of Jack's life, all without cohesion, relying purely on the premise alone to carry the narrative. The beginning setup and up until breaking out of the room was clear enough, but everything that happens after is very muddy. Why are we seeing the aftermath, the grandparents, the TV interview, the newfound daily life of the child? It's clear that Donoghue wished to show all the complicated facets of this situation, both during and after. But this conflicts with the character's perspective whose eyes we're seeing the film through, namely the child. We should be seeing an interesting perspective on the outside world, and how everything is brand new to him now. We get only a small sliver of that, when he's looking at the sky while in the truck. After that, all that the latter half of the film really boils down to, without proper narrative, is just pointless melodrama and immature conflict shown for zero reason. What is actually compelling or interesting about any of this from the child's eyes?The first half of the story was decent enough except for one very unbelievable part: why would the guy not check if the child was really dead? It would have been very simple for him to do. It is really tough to believe that he successfully didn't fall for any of her tricks for 7 long years and now proved stupid enough to fall for this. It is possible that she played a masterfully long game and simply never tried any tricks up until that, so he wouldn't have any reason to suspect her of trickery. But this was not shown or built up, as we enter the film 7 years in already. Hence, regardless of the hypothetical believability of the situation, what is displayed or presented to us as a cinema viewer comes off as strange and not believable.Overall this was a disappointment. A premise as strong as this one has sadly been ruined by just plain bad filmmaking."
" Beautiful and Moving
",2019-07-07 00:00:00,9,"Room is an emotional movie that excels on all fronts. The tone is very soft, yet the theme and premise is one that will elicit a strong reaction. The cinematography is masterful as the film and its characters grow, so does the perception presented to the viewer. The strongest point of this film is the emotion and psychology behind these characters. Brie Larson shines through this film, telling a good portion of this story through facials or lack-thereof. Jacob Tremblay carries the story by providing the eyes of innocence for the viewer. Room engages the viewer as if they are living through the events themselves. Overall, Room is a masterpiece of an emotional experience that is light on touch, but heavy on substance."
" Love it, many symbols
",2019-07-06 00:00:00,10,"It's not just a story about a woman being held against her will. It's about how 2 people can face almost the same awful circumstances but their reaction to them afterwards may be different. That displayed itself at the end, where for the boy that place had some happy memories, but for his mom it was a nightmare. ""Room"" was ""home"" to him but terror to her."
" Impressive, staggering and rogatory!!
",2019-07-03 00:00:00,9,"What an amazing happening is that such a movie could achieved to win Oscar. More precisely, I mean that it is surprising that Academy didn't ignore such a movie out of main-stream styles.
""Room"" is a brilliant movie by the context of its plain, clear shots and narration which avoids from both exaggeration and ambiguation. Many scenes make the audience question ""what would I do in the same condition"". Sentimentally and physically hard experiences are presented so realistic that the one can't help feeling emphatic."

" Glad that I Viewed the Movie But it was Boring
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,6,"Even though the movie was very slow, and tedious at times, I did enjoyed watching the movie. The acting was good and the storyline was well written. It's a shame that things like this does actually happen in real life, and Room reveals the aftermath of the recovery of a kidnapped person. The Jack character really did a good job with his acting as a little boy adjusting to the outside world and to coming in contact with new people. This is an exceptional movie, but I did yawn a couple of times. Sorry."

" Tremblay and Larson excel
",2019-06-07 00:00:00,8,"The most emotionally invested I have been in a film since also A24's Hereditary.
This movie feels of 2 films combined. a invasion movie, and a coming of age story. The invasion consist of overly critiqued Brie Larson. And Jacob Tremblay is so hard to watch in this movie. His characters understanding of the real world was so heartbreaking. He at one point, made me tear up and upon rewatch, cry."
" A movie made me actually cry

" A Great Film For Psychology Students & Film Critics. Not Good For Date Nights.
",2019-06-02 00:00:00,6,"Brie Larson does something noteworthy in this film. First off, she was great. Aside from her general awesomeness, she played the role of an exhausted mother in the room. When getting free and settling in at her parents house, she reviews the life she left behind, then begins playing the role of a regressing teenager with her mother. This show Brie's range as an actress, knowledge of adolescent and trauma psychology by the writers, and good attention to detail by the director.A fine film about a topic that is no fun. Don't watch this on a date - no one gets lucky during or immediately after watching 'Room'. Twice is enough - I won't ever watch this film again.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

" Pretty Good
",2019-05-28 00:00:00,7,"So, I had the check out the little boy that is the youngest to win a SAG award. It was...drawn out. But good. Bothersome. But good. Made me turn away. But good. It was like watching Precious. Good. But you don't buy the dvd and you don't watch it more than once. The Ma character angered me on many occasions. Her resentment for what happened to her was misplaced (which I assume is to be expected). But still frustrating. I don't regret watching. But you will definitely need to watch a guaranteed comedy after to reset your mind."
" Very Good but overrated
",2019-05-24 00:00:00,3,"Nothing about this film is bad, but honestly I don't particularly get the crazy hype. It veers into mega corny about half way thru and then into weird family drama. It's not the masterful experience I expected. Pacing is just way long. It's definitely got torture porn vibes even after the escape it turns into emotional torture porn. It's very one note as well. Tonally very weird in that the perspective shifts constantly. The kid's narration makes the film weaker because it's so randomly interjected. I don't really get Larson's flat performance winning an Oscar either. She's not bad at all, just not as convincing as the accolades. Constantly felt taken out of suspension of disbelief. Not emotionally a tear jerker, just hard to watch fiction"
" Leaving Out Entire Chunks Of The Story Is A Bad Call...
",2019-05-24 00:00:00,5,"This movie felt extremely rushed. Entire chunks of story were dropped completely, and the whole movie itself was so different from the original book. I questioned if the filmmakers even got permission from Emma Donoghue to turn her book into a movie, because why else would they change literally everything? Yeah the theme was the same, but important little details were changed that really didn't need to be. If you stayed true to the book, it could've been better.It felt like reading one page out of the book, and then flipping forward 75 pages. I'm biased because yes, I read the book, so obviously I'm connecting the two, but even if I hadn't, I know a rushed movie when I see one. It felt like a student project or like a short film off YouTube. I don't mean to put it down. The story is incredible, I could never imagine going through all that... but the movie adaptation just... didn't do it for me.The book had me on edge. The book was full of intensity and emotion. I didn't feel that from the movie. The only thing that really got me is when we see just how small the shed is at the end of the movie, from an external POV. Imagine living in there for 7 years--! My issue is just that, so much was left out, and so much was changed. What about Paul, Joy's brother? What about Jack's cousin? Paul and his family were present for almost the entire last third of the book, but they weren't existent in the movie. What about the dog bite? What about Joy and Jack getting an apartment? What about the entire week-long stay at the hospital, all the patients they met? To filmmakers, those may seem like trivial and useless scenes, but to me and I'm sure many others, they were important. I know you only have so much you can shove into a movie... but the obviousness of the rushed state just ruins it. I'm very sorry to say I'll likely never watch it again. I honestly can't even recommend it as I thought I would. I don't doubt this'll get hundreds of thumbs down.I highly recommend you read the book."
" Amazing

" Good I guess
",2019-04-29 00:00:00,5,This is a a good movie. It has a good story line. It has really good acting. It is overrated. But it is good. It not a 8.2 but still I give it 5 out of 10. Quit a good movie. Kind of scary at times. The little boy in this movie is a very good actor.
" Does Room Come Together?
",2019-04-27 00:00:00,7,"Room is half an extraordinary film and half a decent one. Both halves, in my opinion, don't properly come together to create one incredible product. The tonal and narrative shift that this film takes is jarring. Perhaps that was the intent.We begin within the confines of a makeshift room inside of a shed. Ma and Jack are the captives of a disgusting cretin named ""Old Nick"". He kidnapped Ma years ago, and he subjects her to sexual slavery. I might note that the film shows us what ""Old Nick"" looks like, and I think that was a mistake. Why you might ask? It's because of the powerful dynamic that director Lenny Abrahamson establishes right from the very first moment we meet Ma and Jack. We see the special place they've created for themselves in spite of their circumstance. Everything about it seems ordinary, and that's because Ma makes sure that it seems that way to Jack. Jack only knows Room. It's his only base of reality. Abrahamson purposely centers the film through both points of view. In this sense, this first half of the film is extraordinary So why did we need to humanize their captor? Only a sub-human creature would do this to two innocent people. We know these people exist in real life. We choose not to recognize them in news reporting, for the mere risk of legitimizing who they are and the crimes they committed. Cinematically speaking, it would have been more powerful to have made ""Old Nick"" an off-screen character. It would have been more real, and more chilling.Ma and Jake ultimately escape captivity through a crafty ruse of an emergency that includes hot water and a rug. We enter the next half of the film. Life outside of Room. Ma and Jack readjusting to the real world, and Jack's inability to cope with what the real world is. All he knows and loves is Room, and it leaves him completely detached to what is normal. Jacob Tremblay gives an incredible performance. However, the new characters that we meet in this half do not add anything new or substantial to this story. Or at least that is what it seems like, because of the drastic tonal shift this film takes. Needless to say, I wasn't as hooked into this world as I was inside of Room. I wish I was.But warts and all, this is a well made, and extremely well acted film. Brie Larson's role of her lifetime was this one. To realize she's accomplished this and Captain Marvel before turning 30 is mind-blowing. She has not years, but decades of greatness ahead of her. The same can be said for young Jacob Tremblay. Room is, if nothing else, an effective emotional ride, which was all it ever needed to be."
" Amazing first half
",2019-04-25 00:00:00,7,The first have if this movie is amazing but after they leave the room I think it falls a bit flat. I understand that it is showing the effects of afterwards but I think it could have been done better

" Damn near perfect
",2019-04-18 00:00:00,9,"The writing, acting, directing were all amazing, especially from the child(Jacob) so I highly recommend this movie. Yes it's disturbing but considering its based on a true story I think it's worth watching even for people who can't really handle the intensity. If you have a child around that age I promise you it will be way more intense and emotional, to the point that it will bring you to tears. But for a movie to provoke those kinds of emotions really says something about how it's made so for me, thats my kind of movie."
" Room is filled with curiosity that excites and exhausts all of our emotions simultaneously.

" So Sad and happy

" Intense , touching, empathetic
",2019-03-31 00:00:00,8,"Well captured movie of a mother and son captivated in a room by a stranger for 7 years. The son , Jack who was 5 year old hasn't seen the world outside the room since birth. The movie has some intense and intriguing scenes and Jack found it hard to believe the things in real world (outside the room) as very un-realistic in the beginning and slowly realizing it, where his mom had a severe break down mentally. But Jack finally adapt and evolve and learned to be brave enough to bring cheer to his mom and grandma. My rating is 7.5/10 . Jack was fabulous"
" This is what I hope for
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,9,The relationship between all the characters is really amazing to watch in this movie. Beautiful cinematography. Organic lines.

" Leaving You Breathless...
",2019-03-15 00:00:00,10,"Room is such a touching movie full of curiosity. Imagine being a small child, and you've never been outside before. Never. You've only seen a dim light. You don't know that there's more to it than just the wooden walls and a bed and toilet and Room. That was how this little boy felt. His mother, (Brie Larson who acts for her) is going through a rough time. Many mothers can feel her pain, even if they haven't experienced such a horrible experience before. This is a passionate story, a story that humanity will never want to forget."
" Nice Film
",2019-03-13 00:00:00,9,I think it's normal that the film is very slow and heavy in the first hour. They must be able to convey the agony of kidnapping and having to stay in a room for life. For me they did it great then Brie Larson won an Oscar thanks to her acting
" The story seems to be made up, but it strikes me so much
",2019-03-12 00:00:00,10,"I came to this movie after watching Captain Marvel, in which Brie Larson played a boring role, and I wondered what made her famous.
Then I really got amazed and deeply struck by her (and her little child's) exquisite performance. I was moved to tears by this movie which depicted those touching scenes of a horrible story, where the mom and her boy depend on each other and take care of each other.
The movie remind me of how beautiful our world is and what make us human. Definitely one of the best movies I've ever watched."
" Wow just wow

Unbelievable acting and incredible in every respect. I only watched because of the high imdb score and expected to fast watch it by skipping here and there.I have to say that this movie had a very emotional impact on me and I think it was a perfect movie start to finish.For all you skeptics give it a chance and prepare to get sucked in every way."

" Brie Larson in a searing, troubling, and ultimately uplifting story: big message in a small bottle
",2019-03-02 00:00:00,9,"I didn't see Room (2015) when it first hit the theaters because I knew it would be something of a downer (or worse) and I tend not to opt for those. But that, of course, is pretty short-sighted. My wife thought I should watch it even if just to see Brie Larson in her Oscar-winning role before I went to see her as a big-budget superhero in Captain Marvel (2019), so we watched Room on Netflix this week. And of course she was right -- this is a carefully thought out and crafted film that sticks in the mind afterward. Although it's fictional, sadly it's not all that fictional. We read in the news all the time about kidnapping and abduction of young women for sex-trade purposes or worse.I'm not going to worry too much about ""spoilers"" in my review, coming 4 years after the fact -- the IMdB synopsis itself gives away the bare bones of the whole plot -- so I'll just go ahead with my reactions. Larson plays Joy Newsome (""Ma""), abducted on the street at age 17 by an unnamed predator (Sean Bridgers) who keeps her locked in his backyard shed as a sex slave (no other way to put it). 7 years later she now has a son, Jack (Jacob Tremblay) who has no knowledge of the world outside their Room except for what appears on TV. The first half of the movie shows them in their tiny, gruelling world day by day. Joy takes advantage of a temporary power outage to concoct an escape, which beyond all hope actually works. The second half of the movie is their adjustment after re-entry to the world outside (or in Jack's case, first-time entry).But no plot summary gets across the emotional impact and at-times surprising turns of the story. Though Jack is utterly bewildered at first by the reality of the larger world, as young children are very good at doing he adjusts, learns, adapts and accepts over the course of the next few weeks: meeting his grandparents, finally dressing and eating well, just being outside, making a neighborhood friend, delighting in the family dog. It's Joy who has much deeper trouble. After the Great Escape, dealing with the police and the doctors, and making the transition back to her own family home, things are not all rosy. She's unpredictably short-tempered; impatient; aimless; unhappy. She doesn't know what's wrong, experiences a physical breakdown. Shouldn't she be happy and fine? The obvious answer staring us in the face, of course, is that she's exhausted: flat-out, bone-deep exhausted, after 7 unrelenting years of captivity and five years looking out for her son every minute of every day -- protecting, feeding, training, teaching. Healing happens, but it takes far longer. This is a deeply sympathetic portrayal of a very ordinary person pushed far beyond ordinary limits, and Larson delivers every bit of it.Which brings me to the stylistic part of the movie. Everyone here is an ordinary person and acts that way. When abducted, Joy was an average high-school girl with no more personal resources or courage than average, pushed into an impossible situation. She has no particular training in dealing with motherhood, or sexual predators, or isolation and deprivation. Jack is what he is -- a kid with a kid's typical mix of behavior that is variously affectionate, obedient, self-centered, kind, shy, peevish, frightened. Their captor (""Old Nick"") is menacing but also banal -- a social loser who can't hold a job and has minimal competence. Joy's escape bears no resemblance to the kind of McGyver scheme that a normal action thriller hero would come up with; her plan is not really a very good one, is also extremely risky, but it is just bold enough to work. The police officers and doctors who find them and care for them are unspectacular in turn, but they are seen to do their jobs sympathetically and well. Finally, Joy's parents Nancy and Robert (played by major actors Joan Allen and William H. Macy, in strong supporting performances) are ordinary suburban dwellers who had been forced to presume their long-lost daughter was dead. In the intervening years they have separated, and Nancy has a new partner Leo (played very effectively indeed by Tom McCamus). Both Nancy and Leo turn out to be the strengths of their newly rebuilt family: Nancy takes over Jack when Joy cannot, and Leo succeeds in making friends with him while Robert finds that he cannot.The media feeding frenzy that usually accompanies sensational news stories like this ""Woman Held Captive for Seven Years Escapes! News at 8."") is shown too, but not all that much time is spent on it. What little we get, though, does not cast reporters in a very good light. We see one very telling scene where Joy consents to do a TV interview, and the interviewer (Wendy Crewson) sideswipes her with appallingly self-righteous, judgmental questions about what she did with her son.Lastly, a shout-out to young Jacob Tremblay. He was age 9 when making the film, playing a 5-year-old, and breathtakingly convincing at it. It never occurred to me while watching that he was that much older in reality. He's just as major a figure as Larson at carrying the movie and in certain sections has to effectively carry it alone. We know how Brie Larson's career has taken off (literally, in Captain Marvel!) but it's nice to see that Tremblay is beginning to make his mark as well in other features."
" A story of human perserverance and frailty
",2019-02-27 00:00:00,8,"The heart of Room lies in its portrayal of believable human reactions to a horrific circumstance. Director Lenny Abrahamson pulls the audience into the room that our protagonists are in, making us feel like we are stuck their with them. Once in the room, Jacob Tremblay and Brie Larson's performances win me over to their side and have me audibly rooting them on as they figure out an escape plan. Room is solid all around and will not leave you feeling bored because of its interesting choice to shift tone halfway through. Check it out."

" This movie brought me to tears
",2019-02-16 00:00:00,3,"Yes, that's right. This movie bored me to tears. I fully understand why she got an Academy reward for her role. Her inability to convey any emotion on her face was misconstrued as good acting; because being held captive for years doesn't call for a wide range of emotions. The Cinemagic that made this 2-hour movie seemed 6 hours long was amazing. I can't even phantom how they did that. All these 9 and 10 reviews is people feel obligated to give it to review the cost of the Academy Awards. They are lying to you. They are so many things left unexplored which is a shame. . . No wait, isn't or this movie would have been a month long. I get this is supposed to be some heartfelt and emotional movie to move you to tears for some cathartic moment but the sappy music that plays at every vaguely emotional scene ruins. I'd say steer clear and do yourself a favor don't watch this unless you need something to really bore you till you fall asleep."

" Great Movie!
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,9,"Room is absolutely amazing.In the end I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone, whether your interested or not."
" Haunting but rewarding?
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,8,"This movie has a certain spark to it. The first part is about a family stuck in a small room, trapped there by a sexist pig of a man. The mother (played Brie Larson) by finally gets them (herself and her son, played by Jacob Tremblay) out of there with the second half the movie about them adapting to the outside world. All in all, this is definitely a rewarding film to watch without question, clearly deserving a rating of 8 out 10.Those reviewers that said that this film is a harrowing and rewarding experience are right, as it is a film that is powerful without question. One major theme of this film is about survival and finding your place in the world, something which many, many people can relate to. It also deals with trauma from rape, as the mother is raped by a man called ""Old Nick"" (played by Sean Bridgers) at the film's beginning, which is important to portray on film.With that, I think that this review is sufficient and should come to a close."
" A Heartbreaking story
",2019-01-15 00:00:00,10,"I hardly ever cry watching movies. We are desensitized to tragedies that are forced on us by media each day. This film has touched me deeply, I could not hold my tears. The tragedy is being shown mostly from a little boy prospective, for whom it wasn't a tragedy, just a way of being, a long his Ma is always with him. This is why this film sands out among others with similar stories. Highly recommend."
" How Did Abrahamson Do It?
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,8,"22 November 2015. What is remarkable about this movie is that the audience members didn't fall asleep for the first half of the movie and that's a great thing. Unlike The Diary of Ann Franke (1959), the underlying and ominous tone of Room doesn't have the constant and imminent death threat from Nazi occupation that helps to sustain the visceral tension that Ann Frank was subjected to. Instead the director was confronted with the challenge of somehow making the mundane and likely boring life in a small room something of modicum of interest. In a way, the audience experiences the same efforts of the mother to keep her child preoccupied as much as possible with the few resources possible. Overall this movie has a deliciously balanced and sustained plot development often times left out of the confined and happily released plot outlines of most mystery thrillers.The performances are superb and so consistent with the storyline, there isn't any pretense that any of this was stage or acted. The relationships are well developed within the timeframe of the movie and are delightfully varied to reveal the breadth of human responses to such a tragedy. The presentation mostly from the child's perspective made the directorship's job tremendously more difficult but at the same time more captivating and absorbing for the audience. Instead of the usual death lurking around every corner horror genre or the sensationalism of publicity drama, the movie narrowly and richly captures the amazing and arduous behavior of the mother's attempts at some form of normalcy and the doubts surrounding her own competence in having done so.Like The Miracle Worker (1962), the depiction of a world beyond our own universe, our senses, Room offers up a new way of examining our own environment. Unlike Helen Keller, though the child in Room wasn't limited by his senses, but by his limited surroundings. Nevertheless, the audience is exposed to a refreshing and innovative way to re-examine our own limited senses."
" Rrally good story
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,9,"I think Larson's performance wasn't that much Oscar worthy, however Tremblay's performance was superb in my opinion.

",2019-01-04 00:00:00,2,"I had this movie for a while on my watch list because it had a pretty good rating, but I never really got into watching it, as the plot sounded kinda boring to me. Anyhow one day I was bored and decided to give it a try. There is a lot of action going on that never gets explanation and you kinda keep on waiting and waiting for the answers to come up, but in the end, there isn't that much of a plot at all. I was expecting for there to be some really mind boggling plot twist, but all I really got was child throwing tantrum to his mother. If I wanted to see that, I would go to local stores toy isle. Questions unanswered are: Why did the guy kidnap the woman in the first place? What was the lawsuit about? Why was her father unable to watch the grandchild? How could it be, that the kidnapper hadn't never seen the child living in his shed for five years or why was he not allowed?
Not to mention holes in plot, like how the woman was completely used to modern world after seeing it for the first time in 7 years, nor did she even seem impressed by anything. Or, why would she not try to escape? There was a window made out of plastic in roof, she surely could have broken it in 7 years of time.
After they are out of the ""Room"", there really isn't that much to be seen in this movie. Nothing happens."
" A brilliant movie
",2018-12-30 00:00:00,10,"One of the best movie I have ever seen.
The story is told from the perspective of a five-year-old boy, Jack, who is being held captive in a small room along with his mother."
" a strikingly powerful portrayal of love
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,7,"Room is a movie about a mother and son who are forced into captivity in one room. The movie revolves around the adjustment they have to take when in the outside world, it's such a unique film, and seeing a boy react to the real world after believing in a false one is both intriguing and heartbreaking at the same time. It's a pretty powerful movie with very solid performances."
" A good film
",2018-12-18 00:00:00,9,"A good film but a bit weird, Jacob Tremblay is a very good actor in this considering that he was only about 11 when it was filmed."
" exceptional!
",2018-12-18 00:00:00,10,It's a psychological film. The film that tells better about carelessness and baskaldirisi very small. Films with disparity in the film experience narrative difficulties. This movie overcomes the script.
" It's an emotional psychological drama
",2018-12-16 00:00:00,10,"Room is the wonderful and emotional tale of a young boy going into the outside world for the first time due to being held captive in a 'room' his entire life alongside his mother, joy, who will have to cope with the pressure. I tell you what, Lenny Abrahamson has absolutely done it again. Room is a masterpiece of character development, drama and suspense. You really care about everyone in this movie apart from the captor. It is truly great emotional dialogue and film work that moves you so much and changes your perspective on how our world would work to that of, essentially, an alien."
" Emotionally moving filmmaking.
",2018-12-16 00:00:00,10,"Like so many things outside room and in the world, the film felt incredibly real."
" If you're still deciding whether to watch this movie or not just skip reading the rest of the review and hit the play button
",2018-12-13 00:00:00,10,"I watch alot of movies / series, not many remain memorable or make it to my top list. I was on a streaming site one late night around 3 years ago trying to find something remotely interesting to watch a little before i fall asleep and this was right after the movie was released so I did not know anything about ""Room"". The title and vague description grabbed my attention so I played the movie and what a ride.. from the beginning until the very end, I loved it! I finished the movie at around 3 am and had work the next morning, it was one of those movies that you know are worth it. Here I am remembering and recommending it 3 years later."
" Horrifying, beautiful and amazing
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,10,"Room is horrifying, beautiful and amazing. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay both give very powerful performances that deserve every accolade they've received. Plus, the story is absolutely riveting. This film makes you feel all sorts of emotions. It's not an easy movie to watch, but it is well worth your time."
" This is intense, intriguing and indescribably powerful
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,10,"I didn't read the original novel and knew very little about the plot when I saw this movie. It captivated me from the very first second. As the story develops, I was thinking of a dramatic scene to turn the situation over but it was done naturally without a flaw. That makes it powerful and convincing enough to add to the genuine feel to the movie. The best part of the story comes when joy was rescued. The tensions between her and her son, dad and mom are so real and strong yet subtle. The protective-possessive syndrome of Joy just highlights the essence of the whole captive situation. Victim victimises. I highly recommend this film to anyone who are interested to explore something deeper into human emotion especially to all the child psychologist or therapist out there."
" Amazing.
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,10,"The story unfolds behind the eyes of the young boy. When he learns something, you learn something. There are no big, clunky, exposition drops in this movie. Just natural story-telling. The moments that hit you, hit you over the head with a pillowcase of bricks. I've watched this only 4 times since my first viewing, and I know I will cry just as hard the 5th time as I did every other. Would recommend."
" I loved it
",2018-11-12 00:00:00,9,I really loved this movie especially because i read the book. it was such an amazing journey to go on.
" Great movie!
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,10,Truly amazing movie. Was feeling intense the whole time while watching it.
" One of the best movies ever
",2018-11-07 00:00:00,10,Really strong and moving story with great filming and directing and incredible performances by Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay
" Very good movie
",2018-10-31 00:00:00,9,"I think this film is one of the best drama films I've seen. It's a painful story, but the most beautiful one is that it ended with a happy ending"
" Wow
",2018-10-29 00:00:00,10,"Incredible performances, beautifully directed and harrowing subjected matter. A must watch, if you can."
" ONE OF MY FAVORITE DRAMA FILMS AND I DO NOT WATCH THAT MANY DRAMAS...
",2018-10-16 00:00:00,10,"This movie did not have a single flaw in it!!! It's a beautiful masterpiece with a genius cast!!! Brie Larson does FANTASTIC!!! The child actor who played Jack was FLAWLESS!!!! Every scene taking place as Ma's house was the best part, imo. When Joan Allen is in a scene, I will be honest, she STEALS the show!!! She is probably a secondary member of this cast, but does not feel like one at all! William H. Macy gave it his all in his scenes as well, and had just a little screen time, but he was great! Leo is SUPERB!!! Everybody just does wonderful in this!!!!!! It's a fabulous story, REAL FEELS, this movie has it all! The scene where Jack barely escapes Old Nicky was a VERY tense scene!!! It is sad to think that this sort of thing can happen irl... There is not one sliver of fiction in this scene. One of the REALEST movies out there!!!!!!"
" Sometimes boring but emotive
",2018-10-12 00:00:00,7,First half of the film was unnecessarily long. Longer doesn't mean better. And second half could have been deeper.
" It's just so good!
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,10,I watched this movie 3 days ago and it's still on my mind. I love it so much!
" Good story in Jacks eyes
",2018-09-28 00:00:00,9,Great acting by ma and her son Jack. Compelling story and shot realistically. Kept me watching until the end. Not a thriller by normal standards. Liked the pace of the movie too.
" No words.
",2018-09-28 00:00:00,10,I have nothing else to say except that this is by far one of the best movies I've ever seen in my entire life. Brie Larson is such an amazing actress I have never seen a bad performance from her and Jacob Tremblay? Bruh. That kid is just....wow. So much talent packed into such a tiny little human being. This movie is incredible and definitely one of those movies you could watch multiple times and never get sick of it.
" Larson ruined it.
",2018-09-14 00:00:00,1,"I've never liked her and this movie shows why.. Just the way she reacts to things is just bad acting...
The Kid got me through this one."
" Beautiful Acting
",2018-09-14 00:00:00,9,"I loved the journey that this film took me on. If you invest emotionally in the characters and let yourself become enveloped in the film, it will grab you and not let go.The performances of Brie Larsson and Jacob Tremblay are flawless and completely believable.The pacing of the film is good, but slows and fall slightly flat in the middle.An emotional rollercoaster that really draws you into 'Room' and Lenny Abrahamson's perfectly crafted world.9/10"
" So simple...so powerful!
",2018-09-12 00:00:00,10,"The most emotionally demanding film since Rainman. If any person can watch this drama unfold without crying, there is definitely something wrong with them."
" A Superb Collaboration
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,9,"A young woman (Brie Larson) and her five-year old son (Jacob Tremblay) live in the confined ""room"" of the title with only a ceiling skylight and a TV as their access to the outside world. As the story progresses, the viewer learns of the bizarre and heinous circumstances of their situation. The movie is based on the novel by Emma Donoghue who also wrote the screenplay. While it takes place in the U.S. , the film is a Canadian-Irish co-production.When I read the superb novel a few years ago, I hoped it would be made into a film with similar impact but I wondered, is it possible? The answer is an absolute yes thanks to the sensitive directing by Lenny Abrahamson, his brilliant cast, and Donoghue's perfect adaptation.The film follows the book's premise of seeing the story only through the eyes of the young boy. In the book, the interior life and thoughts are illuminating. Luckily, Abrahamson, Larsson, and Tremblay convey similar impact in the film version meeting the challenge of keeping the viewers' attention within the dingy and limited space of the room.The movie's climax happens in the middle, creating an almost entirely new story. It provides amazing insights such as the awkwardness and disillusion that can happen after a presumably positive change. Here again, Abrahamson's attention to detail and subtlety say so much with so little while continuing to get great work from Larson and Tremblay and also from the always dependable Joan Allen.The last scene seems bizarre at first but is understandable considering the trauma of the main characters. It's a perfect result of the other great scenes that precede it and it leaves one's heart wide open.Tremblay gives one of the best child performances since that of Victoire Thivisol in ""Ponette"" (1996). He and others boost ""Room"" to be one of the best movies of 2015.OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT: Directing by Lenny Abrahamson"
" Utter BORE!!
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,1,"First, how does the movie just start with no background information explaining to the audience how this woman even ended up stuck and living in this basement?? Like what happened to her that landed her in this place?? I honestly couldn't get past the first 20 minutes of this movie because it was so boring and offers no explanation for anything. I have no clue how it got such high ratings."
" Half of it was really good.
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,5,"I was really into this movie during the first hour. But I have to say.. I am not sure what the point of the last hour even was.. I figured there must be some twist, but nope. It didn't know what kind of movie it wanted to be."
" Not very good.
",2018-08-21 00:00:00,4,"Very slow, disappointing and over rated! Judging by the reviews I though it would be a good film. Stop lying people..."
" amazingly directed, written, and acted
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,10,"This movie had me feeling whatever the characters felt the entire time. No matter if it was a sad, funny, happy, or anxious scene, I felt as if I was living in the moment and truly enduring what the people were going through, especially the five year old son. The movie is basically in the perspective of the five year old who is the son of the woman who was kidnapped and the captor. In almost every scene, if not all of them, the five year old boy was in it. The only time the viewers left room or any other location in the realm of the film, the child was as well. For example, we never left ""room"" until the son did and we never saw anything past what he was seeing. A lot of films have hard times staying in the perspective of one character, but this one beautifully captured the little boy's thoughts, actions, and emotions. A lot of people are talking about how the film makers could have branched out onto the backstory of the captor and the woman who was kidnapped, what took place seven years prior, and much other various things that are involved with kidnapping. But, in my opinion, that all would have ruined the movie because it would have taken us out of the five year old's perspective and thoughts. If he never saw something, we did not either. The five year old did not have an understanding of the world for most of the movie and he did not understand his situation in ""room."" Therefore, the viewers were not supposed to completely know and understand how the mom and her son got trapped into ""room."" Staying in the young child's point of view is very unique for a hostage/kidnapping story because in almost every other film like this that I have seen, it always drifts into the psyche of the person kidnapped or their captor. This film would not have done so well if it was not in the perspective of the child. If it was in the perspective of the captor, the woman kidnapped, or even the family of the woman, it would have been just like any other kidnapping/hostage film and it would have nothing to set it apart from those films. Being in the five year old's mentality for the entire film also brings in a new way for us to see real life kidnapping and hostage situations. We often only think about the twisted kidnapper or the person who was kidnapped, never really the child going through it all. Whether the child was the one kidnapped or was conceived by the captor and the person kidnapped, we probably will rarely think about them and what they could be going through. All in all, this film definitely is something that I will remember for a long time and will inspire me to create better, original, well-thoughtout, and real content that others can enjoy like I did while watching Room."
" Tad bit disappointing
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,7,"The first hour of the film was very entertaining and enjoyable, thrilling and tense, but as the film went on it began to drag, and drag, and drag, I understand that character development is key and wants to go beyond the original plot but I just didn't enjoy that part, I felt like it was an hour of filler. The first hour was so great I gave it a 7, and although my review was quite negative I enjoyed it overall"
" Love
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,9,The perspective on this movie is so good. Even though it was good it broke my heart watching it. I highly recommend this film. Always remember if you see something say something.
" Long and boring!!!
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,1,"Do not waste your time watching this!!! 
Do not waste your time watching this!!!"
" Great Movie
",2018-08-17 00:00:00,8,"Though this movie is a little slow it shows the internal struggles of a girl who was abducted and they child she bore while confined. It is about hope and the unfailing strength and power of love. It was not exactly what I expected but it is not your typical ""triumph over evil"" situation but more of the complexities of the human emotions and what we as humans are capable of enduring. Bre Larson does really well showing the complexity of a girl abducted, confined, abused but still having strength and a glimmer of hope."
" Not for entertainment, but a must watch.
",2018-08-15 00:00:00,9,"The synopsis doesn't give much about the movie, so I watched the story as it happens. The more I understand what's happening, the more emotions flows. This is a several acts play, and each act is very powerful. Human beings in a harsh world. I often shed a tear during a movie, but this is the first time that it keeps going for a long time after the movie ended."
" This movie will stay with you!
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,10,"The actors played this just right. The little boy reacts like any child would in that environment. It's a wonderful journey watching how this movie unfolds. However, I found myself not liking the mother's character. This is a wonderful movie that I would recommend to everyone."
" Sad, but a Good Watch
",2018-08-10 00:00:00,9,"Let me just start by saying that ALL of the actors did a fantastic job in portraying their characters. It's a really sad movie. My heart was beating so fast when the boy was in the back of Old Nick's truck. I was literally at the edge of my feet. It also brought tears to my eyes when Grandma tells Ma that she wasn't the only one whose life was destroyed. I felt that. Because as a mom, as horrible as it sounds, you'd much rather know your child has passed rather than know that they're probably still out there being tortured, beaten, raped, sold, etc. and you don't know where. I can only imagine how antagonizing that must be. How do you find closure never knowing what happened to your child? This movie is really good. I like how Jack narrates the story because it shows how a little boy his age makes sense of things, how he gathers up what he knows and build his logic based upon that. He's so innocent, yet so smart. I love how his character develops from being a secluded boy to being out in the big world."
" Rubbish and disturbing
",2018-08-09 00:00:00,1,It's rubbish and disturbing. It's like some stupid and boring life.
" Unforgettable
",2018-08-07 00:00:00,9,"One of those movies that you only need to see it once and will stay in your head forever, I cried like a baby when Jack finally got to release his ma (my eyes are watering right now)"
" Sublime movie
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,10,"Good evening, I write feeling very small .... this film ... I think it's not a film, it's far beyond ... they are intense moments of souls and these intense moments are beyond words .... I left, if I left, with emotions, sensations, strong images ... very strong ... very very strong ... upset and yet serene, because the freedom is precious, the life too, not always easy but it does not matter, as ""he"" says so well ... the strength, the courage, the union, the life. ..love, especially love ... and Exist ... Exist anyway .... (if I can say words) these are the only words that come to me but as I tell you this movie is at Beyond words ... I would just add, I took, I think (because no other memory comes to me) for the first time in my life, a huge slap .... thank you all for this beautiful and pure moment of love and soul ... I do not leave unscathed and really thank you, deeply thank you. ... I just saw it, I could write later on this pure moment of emotion that offered me this magnificent director and these moving and magnificent actors ... I have there only one want, it is to erase myself in front of this pure moments of soul and let you yourself discover it .."
" Blackness
",2018-08-02 00:00:00,1,"Once again I am stimulated to review a movie based on what I cannot see, namely, the movie. This movie takes place in a town where, apparently, electricity and the electric light have not yet been discovered and are unknown. Worse yet, the cinematographer, director, editors, etc.etc. seem to be from this same town. Where the scenes are not black, they are so dark one cannot see anything. I wonder again why they bother with set designers, costumers, makeup or anything similar (things listed in the credits) when they can't be bothered to show any of it to the audience. I get the concept of darkness in the shed, but why the darkness anywhere else. One can show confinement and oppression yet allow the audience to see what is going on. Of course that's theory on my part. Maybe the producers and directors were so low budget they were embarrassed by sets and costumes and ""painted it black"" to hide them. The script is ok I guess, but this is supposed to be a movie, a visual art. If you can't see a visual art there is no point to it. There is no point to this."
" Touches the Heart
",2018-07-31 00:00:00,9,"In the real world, our world at this day and time, when children and young women are found after years of captivity, I found this movie to be very realistic and all of the actors did an amazing job, especially the mother and son. 
I found this to be a very emotional movie and I found myself holding back tears at times throughout. 
I would consider this a Must See Movie, although I don't have a desire to watch it again."
" An emotional roller coaster.
",2018-07-31 00:00:00,10,"I came across this movie because of the picture it had on Netflix, decided to give it five minutes to see if it were another typical hour long movie with no real conclusion but Room did not disappoint. Every minute in this movie is so precious, the aftermath of getting rescued ties it all in and it's not only downhill from there but a whirlwind of emotions."
" Amazing
",2018-07-31 00:00:00,10,"This one was well acted ,and very well done altogether.jacob tremblay absolutely blew me away in this how that little guy never got an oscar nom is a crime."
" Heartwarming!
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,10,"Room was a very heartwarming and AMAZING movie. The actors are also a really big part in this! When I saw William H. Macy as the grandfather, it was strange because I've only known him as Frank from the show ""Shameless"" This movie overall was fantastic and I REALLY recommend it"
" I cried
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,6,It is overall a good movie. I couldn't stop crying poor things. It's so sad.
" If you think it's unrealistic, you have a very confused idea of reality
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,10,"I always read reviews before I write my own to recheck that I'm not being too subjective with my judgments. I found the movie captivating, possibly because I haven't made the same close connection as Jack did with his mom and it really pulled at my heartstrings. It's surprising though how people rate it low, citing plotholes and questions that were actually answered in the movie. I'm a big reader of crime news and Ma's story and reasons for her actions were very believable and reasonable. The first half of the story was very thrilling and the second half actually falls a bit flat, but it's a realistic representation of life. People who expect things to continue with ""and they live happily ever after"" will be disappointed.The story is also meant to be seen as it is - focused on the psyche of the two main characters. If you want to go deeper than that, then make your own movie. Overall, I think it's well-done and it deserved the recognition it got."
" One of the best movies I have ever seen
",2018-07-24 00:00:00,10,So amazing. The acting from the little boy was probably the best of all time
" Should have won movie of the year award.
",2018-07-18 00:00:00,9,"This week I was going to watch some Oscar winning movies. I started yesterday with Call Me By Your Name which I absolutely hated. I couldn't get why a dull movie like that could win an Oscar. So today I thought I was going to have a hard time again with Room, but oh what was I wrong. Room deserves totally to win an Oscar, even more than one. Room is a movie that I will remember for a long time, while the other one I already completely forgot about it. The story is very poignant, a rollercoaster of emotions, from hatred to hopeful to sad. I almost never cry with movies but here I have to admit I had a couple hard times containing my tears. Brie Larson deserves her Oscar for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role, there's no doubt about that, but the young Jacob Tremblay was to me the big star of this movie. Even at such young age he deserved an Oscar for his performance. What a powerful piece of acting that was. For once I was blown away by an Oscar winning movie. To me it was just the movie of that year and it should have won the big prize. A movie that I for sure will watch again in the future."
" Yes, it was very good, but...
",2018-07-18 00:00:00,6,"A few minutes into the film I asked myself ""What the hell am I watching"" and thought the characters were completely dysfunctional. Then it hit me BAM!! what was going on and it became very, very interesting. Once mother and son were rescued, though, the film became slow moving and a bit depressing, actually, with constant yelling and sadness.The script and acting was superb, I'll admit. Jacob Tremblay in particular was excellent! It was interesting how the Room held good memories for the son, while it was an absolute nightmare for the mother."
" I hate it When a film Gets to me like this
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,10,"At first a Pretty slow story. After half an hour, it slowly Gets you. Won't spoil anything, Just watch for yourself. Goose bumps, tears etc, etc...beautiful!"
" Painful
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,4,"I don't know if it was what I was smoking when I watched this, but I never want to sit through it again. I'm no seasoned movie critic, but I've got something to say. I immediately picked up on Brie's painfully unconvincing performance. The next thing I noticed was the terrible, soulless child actor who managed to be irritating and unlikable throughout. It felt as if the mother character was supposed to exhibit the pain and torment of both a captive prisoner and the mother from The Babadook, in which both were pulled off horribly. Looking up the movie brings up that its genre is Drama/Thriller, but I honestly could not pick up what this movie was supposed to make me feel. The man holding them captive is not intimidating whatsoever, he poses no threat and does not make me feel scared when the mother and son start taking risks. The tone changes constantly when your child actor cannot emote, stop screaming, or repeating themselves. Compared to decent child actors, the choice here doesn't feel intentional, as if the kid was mentally damaged from living in a shed. It felt like a lazy choice and I didn't care in the end if he survived honestly. The movie did not make me feel any sympathy for him. The kid totally breaks the pacing multiple times, ruining any form of suspense or thrill. He will say something stupid and unrelated, yell, etc. while another character is trying their best to perform. I know he is supposed to be an irritating kid, but I can't help but feel like he could've been done better. His monotone voiceovers come off as cheesy and uninspired, too. Total bore.The worst part? Nothing happens. It's damn boring. Events just kind of happen one after the other - I can barely tell when each act starts and the resolution just felt too.. easy? Simply getting out a-okay from the shed after having to vomit on her son didn't feel like a nice payoff. And the movie just keeps going - never ends. I hope I never have to sit through this again thank you Hanni for making watch this boring, loud, overrated movie. I see a gold film in here, but as of now I cannot fathom how this got any awards. The whole thing felt almost laughably bad if it wasn't for the lack of literally anything happening at all."
" Atmospheric and precise, Room is a well-made, worthwhile watch
",2018-06-09 00:00:00,8,"Even if it didn't quite emotionally grab me the way the book did, I finished Room satisfied. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are excellent, and major props to Abrahamson for getting such a quality, realistic performance out of Tremblay. Room does a great job of taking its time and letting the setting really seep into your mind, and then create a jarring contrast with the real world. It is broadly positive and uplifting, and I respect the choices they made, by and large. The biggest exception was that I thought Jack's rapid, rather smooth transition socially to being around other people and losing the familiarity of the items in Room was unrealistic. I also thought they could've further shown what was bothering Ma and her mental state after returning. Those points aside, it was great and I loved the acting, script, and intentional cinematography in the angles and lighting choices."
" Speechless
",2018-06-08 00:00:00,9,"What a movie! I have no idea what to write. It left me speechless. Main actress reminded me of Jennifer Lawrence and I think she would nailed this role even better.8,5/10"
" Had many expectations - non were met
",2018-05-29 00:00:00,3,"The premise had potential, but writing was poor. The movie was all over the place and the scenes were cut just when they would start to get interesting. Characters aren't psychologically developed. They're shallow and onedimnsional. The kid that went through so much trauma in his life came out completly normal. Sure, he's young, but there is no way he's undamaged after that. The mother, raped, abused, inprisoned, had some brakedowns, but none were solved onscreen. Also, how the hell does that acting win you an oscar? Not saying it was bad..but it wasn't Oscar worthy. With that script there's not much you can do. But there was no emotion on her face at the end when she saw the room again. No reacton. A lot of actresses would've dona a much, much better job. She just wasn't convincing enough. In fact, nothing about this movie was convinsing. Their escape? Behaviour of their kidnapper? Completly unrealistick. Some of it (him living the kid so he can spill his dirty sicret) was just ilogical. There were some nice shots there, though. Jack (the kid) narates the story. To him that small room seems big. They've managed to capture that, so points for that. Also, the kid is a pretty good actor for his age. But that's about it. 
All in all, this movie was a dissapointmant and a waste of time."
" Excellent..
",2018-05-27 00:00:00,10,"Such a touching movie.. We've seen movies about the struggle of people been abducted before, trying to survive and run away, but this.. this is such an emotional film, explaining mostly the struggle of trying to fit in again.. Learn yourself, and society all over. .. this kid though.. pure angel.."
" gutwrenchingly beautiful
",2018-05-19 00:00:00,9,"I just do not understand the bad reviews on here..
This movie was amazing. I could not be more impressed with Brie Larsons performance as Ma - except for Jacobs Tremblays performance as Jack. How such a young child can act so incredibly well is beyond me. 
Both characters are absolutely believable and this movie really does break your heart. 
Where most movies would climax is only the half way point of this movie making for very interesting far from usual storytelling. 
Generally slow moving (but not in a bad way) I think maybe 20mins could have/should have been taken off and would make for a better overall film as it did feel like it was a bit long for what it could have been.
Would have loved to understand the characters of the dad and captor more as these were not explored.
Overall well worth the watch, I will remember this movie for a long time!"
" Sky-light to the human SOUL
",2018-05-07 00:00:00,7,"The novel and movie was inspired from the true Austrian Fritzl case of 2008, where the father kept her daughter captive for 24 years in a basement and raped her over that period that resulted in birth of 7 children - 3 remained with the daughter, 3 with the father with his wife and 1 had died after birth.The novel written by Emma Donoghue has the same premises, but is a fictional account. The story is told from the eyes of the little boy. Here the perpetrator is a stranger who kidnapped and keeps a 16 year old girl captive in a 11X11 feet cramped room (which has a tub, wash-basin, toilet, kitchen bed, cupboard, a TV and only one skylight) for 7 years.The movie starts when Joy is 24 year old women with her 5 year old son Jack in this tiny space where they create their own world. It is a gritty story of survival of Joy and her mother's instinct to protect her son Jack and planning an escape so that they are freed from this hostile and captive room for Jack to see the wonders of the world. By the mid-point of the story Joy succeeds in her plans and is rescued by police. The second half focuses on re-integration of Joy and Jack within the society and their family but skips the perpetrator's arrest and prosecution.The main three characters Joy - (Brie Larson) Jack - (Jacob Tremblay) and Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) play their parts beautifully. Brie won the Oscars Academy award as Best Actress for this role and another Jacob had 45 award nominations from which he won 19 awards as best supporting young actor.The movie did excellent business after the Oscar award for Brie Larson. On a budget of 13 million, it did a business of 36 million world-wide.The Director Lenny Abrahamson has done a marvelous job in remaining true to the novel, thanks to the help of the author Emma who also wrote the screenplay of the movie. The movie is rated all time 136 best movies of the world rated by IMdb and has 239 nominations from which it has won 130 awards. Phenomenon.Good thing about the movie is that even after undertaking such an abusive subject, Lenny and Emma have created a clean, touching movie that moves us to tears and smiles and final triumph of human spirit. A bit slow but to transport to the lives of Joy and Jack - one needs to hold the flag of empathy. A good Drama thriller.I would go with 7.25 out of 10 P.S.
Just for those who are interested in Fritzl case, the father is life-imprisonment till death in Austrian prison and the daughter was a given a new identity and lives with her children a normal life."
" Amazing Movie
",2018-05-06 00:00:00,8,"Brie larson is wonderful. Kid did the great job. 
This is great movie about motherhood and love, and care and it deserves all the awards and high grades it has. Very smart movie."
" Of awards and more
",2018-05-04 00:00:00,4,"Here comes another award-winning supposed to be slayer. And guess what? It is the polar opposite of the same description. There's nothing embezzled about this movie that will shine.
Brie Larson plays the seven year long rape victim mother ""Ma"" of a boy who's just turned five and who is very happy in achieving this feat. Jacob Tremblay plays the role of 'Jack' the kid. Ma has raised her precocious son on her own. She has tricked Jack into believing that that 'room' is the beginning and end of this world and that there's nothing outside but space. She has in fact made a bed, school, bathroom and what not in that cramped little space that her captor Old Nick, played by Sean Bridgers, has provided her with. There's a television set also on which everything is perceived as unreal and false by Jack for the lack of exposure to the outside world.
In an attempt to make it more plausible for us to believe, and probably for Jack too, that they can survive and get out of there someday, there's a skylight at the top of the room through which sunlight enters in the room during the day. All in vain of course. 
There is basically no story. You see them living inside a room first and then living outside the room after when they manage to escape in an episode that could not have been more childish where Ma instructs Jack to lie still after rolling him into a rug so that she can pretend his death and mourn over it when Old Nick comes home at night to have his daily quota of sex with her. The plan works and Jack escapes finally, until he is caught by Old Nick and surprisingly, is left behind safe by him after one fat guy watches him get manhandled by Old Nick. You almost feel like screaming,""Why O Why?"" Nick never comes back in the movie should be a serious enough indication about the kind of logic that was applied in the writing of this film. Nor does Ma ever get involved with him again. 
The real drama happens afterwards when the mother son duo have to live in Ma's parents house, who apparently have separated. Ma can't stand that house even since she isn't at good terms with her parents. Especially her father, whom she believes has been deliberately ignoring her son since they both stepped into the room. Ma also tries to commit suicide in a genuine attempt to apologize to Jack in a fanciful manner for ruining his childhood and treating him the way she did. The moment you think there's an interesting development being made the scene ends. And this happens enough times that you give up on the film altogether. 
As if the it wasn't enough tragic that both Ma and Jack visit that 'room' again towards the end of the film. That's when you realize your last couple of hours could have been more productive washing your car or making toast."
" Room
",2018-04-26 00:00:00,7,"What is a room? It's an enclosed space. Those two notions, when broken down, alomst seem incompatible, for to be enclosed is to limit or constrain the space within something, whereas space is the expansive area in which things, people, and places exist. But unbounded space is not only infinite, but also almost meaningless, since spaces are defined by their boundaries. This is the heart of what Room is about: the fundamental hum,an exoperience of and connection to space, spaces, and the reality of people and things within those spaces to our conception of the world around us and our experience even of our own selves. Room explores these ideas overtly and narration that explicitly speaks from the perspective of one of the main protagonists, a young boy with extremely limited and innacurate experience of the world even for his young age, on confused notions of ""inside"" and ""outside"". His whole reality, all he's ever known is a single Room and to him it is the world. It is also a prison. His mother is a young woman who was kidnapped as a highschooler and repeatedly raped (and thus impregnated) by her captor (also the boy's father). He believes the outside world doesn't really exist and the images of the outside he sees on the TV they were provided in thier ""home"" are fake. There are no real trees or dogs or cars, because he only sees them in images on a screen and was told by his mother (ostensibly for the sake of sparing him knowledge of that which he may never see) that these things were not real and that all that was real was their world: ""Room"". Much like we call our world ""Earth"". There's a whole lot of the ""Allegory of the Cave"" in this tale. When the characters eventually break free (after a tense escape plan) they must strugle to adapt their reality. They have opposite, but equally difficult adjustments to make to reconcile their new reality with thier old one. The child has a bigger gap to bridge: the entire conception of reality he has has been a mixture of confusion, simplification, limitation, and lie (albeit white lies). When his mother starts explaining the truth, it is litterally world shattering to him and he reacts with hostility and denial (as we all do when our Truths are challenged). When he actually sees the outside world, it is strange, surreal, and overwhelming to him. He cannot process the stimulation, the pace, and complexities. But he is young and still ""plastic"". His situation, while extreme, is not so different for a concentrated does of the kind of confused revelations that all childhood consists of, and which allow for growth and expansion. His world, though expanded radically, becomes quickly accepted. Relatively speaking, anyway.His mother, on the other hand, initially deals much better. She has the euphoria of escaping and being safe. She is not overwhelmed and has an ingrained muscle-memory of how to interact with people, things, and to live in the world. Only after some time does the horrifying and inescapable truth set in: that, although she's escaped and now is back living in a world she'd spent the last 7 years dreaming and praying she mght one day return to, a whole chapter of her early life was stolen, the trajectory of her life inalterably transformed from what it could have been, and in some sense her life can never be normal. She can't go back to being a teenager. The people she left behind, though they no doubt suffered, went on living. They aren't the same. Her parents are both older, divorced, and changed. She may have reclaimed life, but not her old life... that is gone forever. The acceptance of the new is more easily accomplished than letting go of the past and of lost dreams.These dual existential crises continue to be portrayed throughout the film as problems of space, of size and scope. The mother can't relate to the people she held so close before because they no longer share a common point of reference. No one can know what she's been through or how she's feeling. She feels alone. The boy sees so much that he just can't square, he feels the opposite of alone, instead retreating inward and wishing to retreat back to ""Room"" where everything was so much simpler: just him and his mom and the transient, though traumatic, prescence of their captor (""Old Nick"" as they called him). Later in the film, though both a gesture of solidarity and of some intrinsic commonality between these two poles and by some dialogue, the film expands that isolation of self through shared human love... stating that we as human find strenth in each other-in our relationships and mutual support-an expansion of self that creates community and family in much the way the world of the enclosed space of a room can expand to break free of those boundaries to include many rooms and many spaces within a multiplicity of spaces.There's so much mataphor and subtext here that a single viewing and the time and thought I've given it thus far can't possibly fully flesh out all the dimensions of this film. It's applicatible to so many things-social, psychological, anthropological. But it's also a film deeply intimate in our humanity and in the portrayal of the characters, their experiences, the overall transitions and transformations for those characters, and well executed attention to small details like that the boy has to now learn to walk down stairs or wear shoes for the first times. It struggles with the contradiction of how a prison can nevertheless become a place we may still in some way regard as ""home"" and even miss once gone, all while still being glad to be free from it. Much the way we can miss an ex from an otherwise bad relationship or miss a small crumby apartment during difficult times after moving to a better, bigger dwelling, or miss simplistic notions of childhood once we've learned and grown and become wiser. Those smaller, simpler, albeit more confining and even hostile worlds, may not exactly represent a kind of Stockholm sindrome so much as they represent the innature human tendency to perceive reality and attach a sense of our own personage, of both ownership and identity, to our surroundings and our sense of self. A room is not just an enclosed space, but typically refers to a purposefully but arbitrarily made one, crafted and maintained both for refuge from the hostile outside world and also to give structure and organization to an otherwise unstructured and chaotic reality of nature.Room is not just an enclosed space, but space itself. To have room is to have space and to have more room is to have more space. As rooms and spaces expand or contract, so to do their bounded realities. When the mother and boy return to ""Room"" at the end of the film, it looks impressively small on the screen (wonderful cinematography) whereas earily it had seemed quite large with lots of scenes shot at different angles and dialogue of our child protagonist detailing the expanse of his territory (""good morning, sink!, good morning, chair!, good morning bed!""). There's a lot of subtle camera work like this and small plot or sequence elements that add richness to a film that otherwise could have just been another A&E special about a kidnapping victim. But this one does not begin a crime and end with an escape. This one begins with introducing and fleshing out a world, small though it may be, then explaining its origin and by explaining that world it thus tears apart and breaks that world down like Captain Ahab finding the White Whale. The great secret of this reality being revealed, the challenge is to escape from this reality and back to that Golden Age of Before, before the cataclysm, only to find that the old world cannot be rebuilt. The film ends, not with the destuction of the world we finally found to be fraudulent, but with the confrontation of incompatibility between the past, present, past-perceived futures, and presently-perceived futures in the narrative of a human mind and within the turmult of the human heart and spirit and the difficult and painful process of reconciling, processing, absorbing, and reframing those things to create new realities. So it is with all tragedy, loss, grief, and trauma. This film has the courage to stand up and really look at these concepts in smart, honest, realistic ways.Room is not a happy or even pleasant experience, but it is moving, deep, and memorable. It does offer hope and a good deal to chew on for days, weeks, months to come. While the overt overtures to spatial concepts and identity are there, they are well complimented by an easier to follow narrative of human tragedy and emotion along with less overt nods to those topics to continue adding dimension at times where the film might have otherwise has reverted to formulaic linear storytelling. It's not a movie you'll long to see again to relive the experience, but it is a movie that will stick with you long enough that you end up rewatching to continue peeling that onion."
" Emotionally moving, captivating and well made
",2018-04-07 00:00:00,10,"This story about a young mother, stuck in captivity with her innocent five-year old son, is among the finest shown in cinema over these past couple of years. Though there is a glimpse into the horrors of being what it's like to experience being locked up by a twisted, cruel captor for many years inside his small garden shed, the plot also emphasises the struggles they face when having to face the real world that lays outside of 'Room'. Yet through it all, the deep and unbreakable bond between Ma and her little boy, Jack, which punctuates virtually every scene, is what makes this film so moving and never ceases to uplift.Brie Larson's performance as Ma is absolutely phenomenal; her portrayal as this woman protecting her little boy while battling the gut-wrenching struggles of being stuck inside Room, and then facing the difficulties of transitioning back to the outside world is so beautifully authentic. It was no surprise, and certainly no injustice, that she gained a 100% deserved Oscar win for Best Actress that year. Jacob Tremblay's portrayal as this sheltered, innocent little boy born into this dark world without a full awareness of what's truly going on is also fantastic. The outstanding chemistry between Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay is a huge contributing factor in successfully bringing across this story onto screen.But aside from the emotionally powerful storyline and excellent acting of the two leads, it is also a brilliantly shot film. Lenny Abrahamson fully deserved his Best Director nomination at the Oscars (despite never standing a chance against the likes of Inarittu that year) as he makes excellent use of cinematography, editing and set design to give an authentic picture of the character's perspective of what Room would be like, as well as the outside world later on. Some of the shots are truly beautiful, in spite of the lack of flashy special effects or lavish set design. Just in case you thought this film would only be good for its acting or emotional capacity, it is a genuinely well filmed movie.It's great to see that this film on the IMDB Top 250 list, that it's at least come close to getting it's deserved recognition. I would confidently proclaim this as one of the best films of this decade, right up there with the likes of Inception and 12 Years a Slave, not something many people would say."
" Unique, endearing, magnificent
",2018-04-03 00:00:00,10,A beautifully spectacular film with an interesting plot that carries past the viewer's expectation-excellent! A heartwarming piece of authentic artwork-well worth a watch; a film of great significance carrying important values of today's society.
" Must Watch!
",2018-03-22 00:00:00,10,"It's quite a long time since I watched a movie that made me shed a tear. This one did it for me again.
I loved this movie in many angles such as acting was moving both from Brie and Jacob, development of the story was just right. While watching this, I can't help not to question myself what if I was Joy.. how would I have handled it ? Fight and kill my kidnapper ? Commit suicide when I didn't see any hope escaping that room ? The thing is ... you cannot say Joy was so stupid to let herself be captive for seven years. You just don't know what it's like. He got kidnapped when she was a teenager and kept in that shed for 7 years. I am sure there are a lot of possibilities she had thought of to escape that place. She attempted to escape once with no success and got her wrist broken for it. In one scene, she was questioned by the reporter if she had not thought of requesting his captor to have Jack be adopted to give him a better normal life. And she answered .. ""Why? He had me."". And I realized, why didn't she ? But for Joy, requesting that from a man, his captor, obviously someone she does not trust at all, would be a risk. There is no safer place for Jack other than with her. I have read some reviews that think how she behaved was totally unrealistic. Being a captive that long and in that conditioning would have affected her mentally / her reasoning. Again, with her situation, it would be hard to judge. And when they finally got out, you would think .. at last, freedom! In the scenes following the escape as they start their new lives, it felt that they are still trapped somehow.. trapped from the memory and horror of their experience, and the judgement of people around them. I loved that take. I think what's powerful about this movie is the fact that it is realistic enough this can happen to you and it lets the audience imagine themselves what if they are in Joy's situation.I give it a 10 and would definitely recommend others to watch it."

" Excellent Film. DO NOT WATCH THE TRAILER!
",2018-03-15 00:00:00,9,"Responding to ""bob-the-movie-man"", you are so right and I am so glad I didn't watch the trailer! Whoever decided to précis the story into a one minute trailer needs more than ""a good talking to"". I wonder how many people had their enjoyment of this masterpiece completely ruined by knowing exactly what was going to happen?I must admit that at 14 minutes in I was thinking ""Why am I watching this weird film about a woman and kid living in a tiny room"". But I stuck with it and am so glad I did. Not knowing how it would end made the film riveting. Sorry for all the people who watched the trailer. I even told a friend not to watch the trailer and stick with it past the 15 minute mark as the pieces begin to fall into place.As for ""bob-the-movie-man"", I'll be visiting his site regularly from now on. Good job, and good review, Bob."
" dismal attempt at tugging on heart-strings
",2018-03-07 00:00:00,3,"Considering the horrific subject matter, this movie managed to come over as glossy, superficial, and above all it was determined to be emotionally manipulative at every opportunity. I'm sorry but since when was kidnap, imprisonment and prolonged abuse as cosy and sentimental as this? In what way does this movie attempt to truly confront its audience with the raw, vile atrocity of its subject matter? It didn't need to be ultra-explicit visually, but 'Room' was presented more like a hankies-at-the-ready emo weepfest than a genuinely harrowing study in cruelty and repression. As for the 2nd half of the movie, the attempts at scenes of angsty/shouty family drama and turmoil were from the straight-to-DVD standard school of acting. All in all a bland, boring and forgettable excercise in hollywood 'realism'."
" Too realistic
",2018-03-06 00:00:00,5,"A pure drama film
The film is so realistic, the thoughts the ideas the acting the scenes.... which make the film good and watchable
The only scene i felt the real drama with action and suspense was the escape scene, the rest of the film after, is very boring and waste of time
I think this film is overrated"
" not credible
",2018-02-28 00:00:00,4,"I didn't find this film all that realistic. If a mouse can find its way in, seems that a woman and a boy could have found their way out easily. It just didn't work for me. Escaping from bad parents though, that is hard. They keep bringing you back!"
" intense, heart warming, and very deliberate
",2018-02-19 00:00:00,10,"Room is by far one of the most intense movies I've seen in a while, the tension is everywhere and it honestly is frightining. There are also severalparts in which I almsot cried due to its heartwarming, Brie deffinetly deserved that Oscar, and the director and screen writer should also be excepionally regarded. I highly reccomend this film to anyone, but at the right moment."
" From one room to a bigger world
",2018-02-11 00:00:00,6,"Room is about two people. Joy (Brie Larson) and her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay.) Joy has been held captive for seven years. She is locked in a small room in a shed with only a skylight. She has been raped by a man called Old Nick and given birth to their son, Jack.Jack now 5 years old has grown up in this captive world, every morning he addresses the thing in the room. His only view of the outside world is what he can see from the skylight.However Room is not a movie about a mother and child locked in a room while Old Nick abuses them. It is about Joy planning their escape and then trying to adapt to a new life with her mother, now split from her father. Her dad meanwhile has difficulties accepting Jack.The film is rather bland. Of course the first portion of mother and son living in such distressing conditions is harrowing but Jack looks a little bit too healthy apart from his long hair. Joy only seems lost when she tries to fit in to her new circumstances once she has left the room.The film was rather underwhelming and uneventful. Jacob Tremblay gives a good performance."
" Claustrophobic beauty
",2018-02-02 00:00:00,9,"That review summary may sound very oxymoronic, but to me it applies to a film such as 'Room'. A film with a difficult subject, that is the stuff of nightmares, but tells it so beautifully with an interesting approach that works better than all the potential traps that films of its genre could fall under.What could have easily have been told in a lurid, gratuitous way (being inspired by the true-life case of Josef Fritzl) is instead told in a careful and restrained way. There is even an innocence in 'Room', due to its very fascinating decision to tell it from the viewpoint of a five year old, in this case Jack, one that comes off very movingly and gives a sense that there is a little ray of hope in a seemingly hopeless situation. The source material, equally brilliant, is to be thanked here, its author Emily Donoghue adapts it to screen here and none of its power is lost. Really appreciated the careful and restrained approach to the storytelling in 'Room', and for me and many others it was something different considering the subject. It does though affect some of the pacing in the middle act, where a little of the tension seen in especially the first part is lost a little. For my tastes too, though it probably did fit the film's younger and more innocent viewpoint it's told from, the music score does lay it on too thick with the treacle.However, loved how the story was told and its approach. What 'Room' also strongly benefitted from being told this way was that the mother and son relationship was able to shine through and really resonate, which it may not have done as effectively with a heavier tone. And shine through it does, with great charm and poignancy. Also appreciated that none of the characters were painted too black and white, even Old Nick. Production values are effectively claustrophobic and the nocturnal parts chillingly nightmarish. 'Room' is beautifully directed by someone who understood how claustrophobic thrillers worked, how mother and son bonds do in dire situations do and the ability to combine both to ensure a powerful experience. A directing job that's both unsettling and empathetic. Similarly 'Room' is written with effortless skill and deft thoughtfulness. Can't find anything to fault the performances. The superb one of Brie Larson, that was a very worthy Oscar (Golden Globe and Bafta too) win in her category, is an obvious starting point, but one mustn't overlook the beyond-his-years turn of young Jacob Tremblay, one of the best child acting performances in recent years, and William H Macy and Joan Allen both giving some of their best work in years. Sean Bridgers also gives much more to what could have been a standard cliché role.Overall, great powerful film but the somewhat fascinatingly unconventional (for the genre) way the story was told won't work for some. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
" Emotional, great movie.
",2018-01-28 00:00:00,9,"This movie hits you with a lot of emotions. One of the largest I got is sadness and frustration knowing that there are people out there right now, locked up, used and abused. Disgusting that such a thing still exists, and sad that it always will. I hope this movie will help people understand the mental effects from all kinds of abuse, and to have patience and understanding for anyone they may encounter in life who has been through something so horrible. The strength of the mother and the child was an impressive thing to see. Instead of giving up, she did her best to turn a small shack into the world for her boy. It would be incredibly difficult to raise a child in that situation, and especially one who is happy and loving. The acting was amazing by Brie and Jacob. Jacob especially did such a great job for someone so young. This must have been a difficult job for him but he handled it perfectly. Brie had to show such a large range of emotion, and earned her awards for sure. You believe every bit of it. I can't say much about the actual story without giving things away. I suggest if you haven't seen this, go watch it now. Don't watch a trailer, don't read any more reviews. That's how I went into it, and I think that is the best way to see it. This movie deserves every bit of a 9/10. A difficult subject, but one that needs to be seen and felt."
" Couldn't bear it
",2018-01-23 00:00:00,2,"About halfway through this movie I gave up. Just couldn't take the boredom any longer. How can some people rave about such an idiotic flick?
Mind you, the basis was ok but the interpretation of the situation was absolutely debile! They were kept locked up in a friggin' shed with a window in the roof! All this lamenting woman had to do was to carefully remove that pane of glass during the absence of the ' villain ' and escape with the little brat. I could go on..."
" exceptional first half, half success the second one
",2018-01-15 00:00:00,8,"The Good:
First half is exceptional, no doubt about it. The mistery about the room is kept just right, the mother-son relationship feels real and yet it´s all covered with a lovely sense of fantasy. Most of all there are a couple of scenes of almost unbearable beauty that capture successfully all the ashtonishment the mere existence of this world can bring to any of us. The film´s concept is necessary for these to work, and they do indeed, in what can potentially be a powerful and beautiful eye-opening experience.
I´m generally against voice-overs but the kid´s narrations are wonderful. One of them specifically is brilliant as a joyful tearjerker.
The Bad:
The second half isn´t remotely as confident as the first one. That´s a pity because the point is very interesting and had the potential to become a seriously outstanding film.
Focusing on the boy is a great way to manage such a complicated emotion as the adaptation to the real world and the film should probably have gone all the way with that idea. We don´t really see the world through his eyes as much as it is intended to because we´re stepping out of him too often. The childish amazement loses most of the presence for quite a while. We´re left with small bits of information about other characters while the boy´s transition loses detail.
The Ugly:
This is the kind of film that inspires reactionary ratings. We´ll see how it holds up with time. Some people might want to put it down because most people will overlook its flaws in favor of the torrent of emotions it produces at its best moments."
" Unforgettable movie
",2018-01-07 00:00:00,10,"This was a brilliant movie about a boy who has never been exposed to the outside world because his mother was kidnapped and held in a garden shed. Ma and Jack's situation is slowly revealed to us in pieces through Jack's perspective. As we gain more information about Room, the tiny space Jack and his Ma are confined to, we discover they are being held captive by a man called ""Old Nick"". He kidnapped Ma long ago, and she has matured into an adult and a mother in Room. Old Nick is a typical abusive kidnapper type, but his violence toward Ma is devastating from Jack's perspective.
Ma does everything in her power to keep Jack safe. When Old Nick moves to touch Jack, Ma fights fiercely to protect Jack, showing how strong her love for him is. To Jack the room was the whole world. . When they finally manage to escape their confinement Jack finally learns about the world outside of his small room. 
The second half of the movie is very different. They escape from Old Nick, but adjusting to freedom proves to be more difficult than attaining it.
Room provides a deep and critical exploration of what happens to Ma and Jack in the second act. It suggests that the most important challenge for them to overcome isn't the kidnapping at all; it's figuring out how to be normal again. This leads to meaningful discoveries for both characters, and through their growth, the audience grows too.
There are some things that really don´t make sense ! Joy's father had potential, but disappeared. He's happy his daughter returned, but won't even look at Jack, most likely because he was conceived through rape. There was some good tension in the second half with that scene and I'd have loved to see more of Macy and Larson going at it. Instead, once he leaves that scene, he never returns and it feels like a missed opportunity.
Other than that this movie was heartbreaking . The ending is intensely satisfying. It is more rewarding because of how Ma and Jack are challenged. Room reminds us to be thankful for what we have and love a little more fiercely."
" Yes, you will sob. Watch it anyway.
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,10,"Well, I started crying no less than 4 times, so let's start there. And those moments were not about music crescendoes or powerful speeches. Nope. They were simple and profound moments. I just cared so deeply for the characters and the story that they punched me in the gut. This movie understood pace and silence more than any film I've seen this year. The audience rediscovers the world alongside Jack...and we find it to be a scary but also beautiful place. We can barely take it in. And so can he. Brie Larson is great, but that kid nailed it. Just wow."
" Just loved it

A great crew, fantastic plot, serene screenplay and amazing lyrics gets you this movie. There are movies that make us cry, this isn't one of them. Its all about life and freedom. This movie would definitely make you feel more human."
" Dumb Parts
",2017-11-03 00:00:00,7,"One thing I hate are dumb parts of movies.... things that you know just would not be true. And you're not watching a fantasy so... there shouldn't be. Couldn't stand the part where lawyers got involved and acted like the victims would be responsible for prosecution costs. Absolutely idiotic. So if someone commits a crime it wouldn't get prosecuted unless the victim pays? Yeaaaa OK. ABSOLUTELY BRAINLESS. Otherwise good movie, but those completely idiotic occurrences in films, and this one is bad, is inexcusable. Especially as they HAVE to know it's BS but keep it in anyway to try to create more drama. I took of one star for that but it's annoying me so much right now I want to take of more..."
" Among one of the BEST movies I have ever seen!
",2017-10-25 00:00:00,10,"I put this movie right up there with ET, The Sixth Sense, Song Of The South, etc... A must see for anyone who enjoys well a well thought out story, excellent acting (especially that of child actor Jacob Tremblay). What a great acting job young Jacob did. What great, well thought out, extremely realistic acting! SPOILER POINT:There is a point in the movie when the boy says ""I hate you!"" to his mother, and it is exactly the way a child would act in his/her situation! If you enjoy a great drama and suspense, then here is the movie for you! Sorry to all those who are looking for blood & guts... Not this movie! This movie does not need gore to impress anyone! A must see, believe me!"
" Bye Plant. Bye Wardrobe. Bye Reasonable Ratings.
",2017-09-27 00:00:00,4,"There was no need to tell the kid that everything outside the room is not real or all the things they get is by magic.Her parents taught her to be nice, but didn't taught her to not trust strangers. A man kidnapped a 17 years old girl by asking for help about his sick dog!!! And she bought that. Writers, please, be more convincing.The kid's character was somehow annoying. And he was talking like a thinker! But the actor played well.When a Hollywood movie wants to demonstrate a drama, all the other things are at their best. For example, they got kidnapped, but the kid has good hair and skin and Ma's family are wealthy and in good shapes, so that there will be no more drama. As another example, watch The Fault in Our Stars.There's a skylight. She has a knife. Old Nick sometimes sleeps in her bed. Why didn't she kill him and try to escape from that skylight or to destruct the walls with something at worst? There were lots of stuff including a wardrobe that she could use to climb. Even if there was no knife, she could use other stuffs. She says that she tried this before, but with not a good plan. Why not try again? There were not much to do except thinking. Even he could have a phone on himself. See, ideas are coming...Eventually she ends up with a plan and without any training she decides to operate the mission at the same night!!!So, Old Nick is a fool!!!The man the kid ran into for help didn't even make Old Nick stop. He just let him go. At least write down the truck's plate number, please.When they go to the hospital after finding the Ma, the Grandmother's reaction was funny. No sign of happiness, shock or anything related. Even the whole family's reaction at first night was weird. Their just eating their lunch.It was slow and long with not necessary characters or events.After Ma is found, movie goes into a boring predictable phase.The idea was good, but the whole product didn't convince me that a young girl and her child would react to the events like this."
" Imaging Living in a Small Room Your Whole Life
",2017-09-26 00:00:00,6,"(Flash Review)The five year old character in this film did just that along with his mother. Early on, you learn that the mother was kidnapped and has been held in a room for quite a long time.even before she had a child. So pretty gross thought there. Semi-spoiler: this film is more about how does one readjust to living a normal life again and reconnect with various relationships strained by the horrible time apart. It has some good dramatic moments but too much of the film is filled with inconsequential moments that attempt to develop the characters and set various tones but they fail to truly convince or increase my emotional stake with them. Interesting approach and story."
" Great movie
",2017-08-29 00:00:00,10,"The movie is really good, it tells the story in a very good way, it makes you feel connected to the film's world. I love this movie. I just think they could tell more of what happened later, I mean, it makes want to know the rest of the story, how their life goes on. I mean, it is so good it does that."
" Based on a true incident
",2017-08-10 00:00:00,7,"This film is based on a true incident in 2008. Jack, five years old, long hair lives in ""room"" with her mother. They live to cook, clean the room and do physical exercises from day to day. Things in the room are all the world for Jack. Jack thinks what happens on the TV is fancy. Sometimes a strange man comes into the room and leaves some foods. One day his mother, Joy tells Jack the truth. There is a real world outside this room. Jack gets confused, but Joy attempts to escape from the room I think that the real thrill of this film starts since Jack and Joy has get away from the room. How can they accept outside world? How can they get used to live outside world? This theme is so big, principal and deep in this film."
" Excellent movie
",2017-08-09 00:00:00,10,"This is a suspense movie. The main character is Joy and Jack. Joy is mother of Jack and has been incarcerated for 7 years. Jack is the five years old and don't know the outside world at all. They have been locked in a small room for a long time. In order to escape from the room, they take action in a certain way. However, when they get out of the room, there is also a problem they have to confront. I feel that their performance look completely real. I strongly recommend this movie."
" Compelling Story Topped with Some Amazing Acting and Great Camera-work
",2017-08-07 00:00:00,9,"It was on my watch-list since long and had a chance to watch it finally last weekend. Room is an interesting story of a 5-year-old boy's interpretation of the real world as it comes face to face with it after circumstances force him to be confined in a small room, totally isolated from the outside world, for the first five years of his life. The movie released in 2015. Story (10/10): Jack and Ma are being confined to a small room by their abductor who kidnapped Ma before Jack was born. Jack hasn't seen the real world - for him, there is no real world that exists outside the room - as explained by Ma who protects him from the abductor at all costs. She also makes sure he has everything he needs even within that small space. However, as he turns 5 and his curiosity about the world increases, Ma realizes it's time to introduce Jack to the world he needs to be a part of. As they implement their escape plan, lead by Jack, he encounters the real world - people, animals, natural phenomena, technology and a lot more. All his notions are challenged at once. The large part of the story is how the relationship between Ma and Jack changes as Jack, now, has a lot of questions for Ma - a little too much to handle for a young mother. However, Jack never gives up on his mother - the only person he trusts blindly in this world - as he slowly adjusts to the real world. While Jack adjusts to the real world, Ma finds herself understanding and adjusting to the new realities, emerged while she was abducted, that adds to her frustration. Acting (9/10): Without a doubt, Jacob Tremblay, playing Jack was the star of the movie and pretty much shouldered it. His acting was top notch as a confused lad who is in dilemma of what to believe and what not. Brie Larson had a tough role to play with a combination of multiple emotions at once sometimes. She was great to watch. Joan Allen made her presence felt in the supporting cast, playing Ma's mother and trying to connect with Jack. Some of her scenes with Jack are really touching as she becomes his second confidant after Ma. William Macy, playing Ma's father, has a very brief role to play compared to Joan Allen. Direction (9/10): Lenny Abrahamson excelled at telling a touching and a compelling story. His use of the camera in the opening scenes to project claustrophobia was impressive. The movie starts off as a little dark and depressing but it kind of opens up as Jack comes out of ""The Room"". While the central focus of the movie was Jack's association with Ma, Lenny also projected Jack's association with the room itself which starts from the opening scene and ends in the last scene. What I loved was the way that closure was brought. In addition, while the movie is very emotional, the melodrama has been almost nil - which made it very realistic. Overall, a very impressive effort. Overall (9/10): A great movie for a compelling story topped up with some amazing acting by the lead cast and great camera work."
" Excellent moving film
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,10,"Jack is the boy who lives in the shed with his mother and he was born and raised there so he has never seen real outer world through his eyes. He and his mother were shut up by Jack's father, but one day, she finally decided to try to escape.The story of is based on real incident called Fritzl case, but the story doesn't progresses following that case accurately. Therefore, the story is half-original but it is a great moving story. I think it was difficult to imagine that situation, but the screenwriter well and realistically wrote life in a shed and first facing with real outer world. You'll understand after watching this, the story about not only Jack but also his mother actually. The bond of them and their growth literally moved me.Moreover, the actors well show characters' emotion even Jacob Tremblay who acted Jack. He was 8 years old when this film was shot, but he really well acted that difficult role I can't believe.The Fritzl case was a terrible incident but making team was managed to make such a great film. 10 out of 10 of course."
" Amazing and breathtaking movie!
",2017-08-04 00:00:00,10,"I did not know what kind of expectations to have before watching this movie. But now, when I've seen it, I must say; WOW! Amazing acting, very realistic and serious story... the way it is all filmed and how the story is told is just about perfect! And Jacob Tremblay is probably the best kid we've seen acting (or at least one of the best). Another positive thing about this movie is that it does not only tell the story of being prisoners and the escape - but also the life after; adapting to ""reality"". Once again; how could I have missed this until now?"
" Unmissable. So brilliant and full of natural emotions.
",2017-07-24 00:00:00,10,"One of the best movies I have ever seen. So impressed by the acting, story and direction. The emotions shown and state of mind depicted are so so original that it makes the movie unique. Movie taught me being free and happy is also tough. You have to learn that as well. You will cry a lot for sure. Enjoy."
" This movie really shows the sorrow out of the characters
",2017-07-05 00:00:00,7,"This movie is based on how a mother and a child live half of their lives locked away in a Room. This movie is narrated from the child's point of view, thinking that out of the room there is nothing but space. The actors really do a great job showing the sorrow of living in a Room. This movie really makes you think how we humans are violent against our own species."
" Best film I've seen for years
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,10,"If I could give this film more than 10 I would. This is only my second review but had to write something as it's so good.The acting is first class as is the story line. I've yet to see Brie Larson in a film but after watching Room, I can see why she is so highly rated. What I also enjoyed was the way the director concentrated on the struggle of the family after the events which is sometimes missed during these type of films. Room will be enjoyed by all film fans."
" Excellent Movie
",2017-06-20 00:00:00,10,I will admit I did not want to go to see this. I thought oh great another chick flick I am getting drug to. Well within a very short time my mind was changed and I never budged from my seat. Not sure I blinked. Jacob Tremblay was magnificent in this movie first of all. The plot was gripping and had you wanting so much for help to hurry up and find them. This movie showed the lengths a mother will go to for the child she loves so desperately. I would watch this movie over and over again and it is certainly not just a chick flick but something everyone needs to see. If you have not seen it you missed the best movie of the year. Go rent it.
" A slow depressing plod
",2017-06-03 00:00:00,4,"I was close to turning the film off after just 15 minutes. It was just a whining boy and a lifeless mother arguing with each other. It didn't get remotely interesting until they tried to escape the room. There was no depth, and I also found it really difficult to understand what the boy was saying half the time (though he was a very good actor). I was looking forward to the film ending, but stuck with it as a friend had recommended it. Nothing really happened after they got out, the escape really was the only interesting part. I felt no emotion for the characters and was unmoved and bored throughout."
" Shocking, emotional and creative
",2017-05-30 00:00:00,7,"Room was an impressive from the start, it unveiled more and more mystery and intrigue as it went on. In the confines of a small room and space a great story of struggle, sacrifice and sadness is conveyed. The film is effective in getting the viewer to formulate numerous thoughts as to why a young mother and her son exist in this small room. We gradually wonder until a shocking and unspeakable truth is revealed to us. After this revelation a number of things makes sense. Like little Jack is slowly coming to terms with reality it gradually sets in for the audience. Lenny Abrahamson cleverly keeps his audience within the confines of that room until he reveals its cruel reality. Its a shocking truth to most who perhaps conjured up all kinds of science fiction related reasons, the reality is bleak. The first half of Room was suspenseful, intriguing and became increasingly poignant as it went on. The strength of the film was in the build up and longing of the mother and her son to escape into the world. The second part of Room while pleasing at the start took a dive as the mother went through emotional turmoil and took the audience through this sad journey. The film wasn't long enough to explore the long ranging effects and aftermath such entrapment would have on the mother and son. Hence it was an unnecessary emotional downward spiral. If the film had built up the need for escape, the difficulty of it and painted a fairy tale picture of the outside it might have been even better. Escape happened far too soon, perhaps this could have been prolonged and intensified so when they finally escaped it would have been a lot more rewarding and satisfying. The outside and final scenes could have been drastically shortened to show a happy and free mother and son. Overall a decent film, Brie Larson gives a stellar performance and one can see why she earned the Academy Award for best actress. 7.5/10"
" Nothing short of amazing
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,9,"*Loved this movie!I saw this film on Frebuary 17 but you know I'm not much a science-fiction fan but I quite enjoyed this one, he his pretty good and incredibleThe movie centers around a girl and his best friends, the girl got a power and she has to live with and to use it properly. The boy is an only child and he lost his mother in a car accident so he has to live with his widowed father. Gwendoline try to help his friend the best she can, and a miracle appearsThe acting of the mains characters Clara Busin and Pierre Foliot was really great, Clara gives a beautiful and very convincing performance, especially during the more emotional scenes.There were moments in The dreaming girl that were so intense that I barely breathe. He is a gripping movie that will take you on a roller-coaster of emotions, but it's well worth the ride !!!!"
" Moving
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,9,"This movie moves you. It is a story of Jack and his mother Joe living their lives in a room for more than 5 years. This room is the world for jack. Outside is space. Yet they manage to be happy at times, sad at times, normal at times and angry at times.I was glad the movie did not end with their release from the room. It showed their life in the real world. The amazement of jack at all the simple things we take for granted, yet for him they did not exist just some time ago. The regret, anger and sense of loss of Joe. How Jack was still attached to the room which was now a crime seen, but for him, his childhood venue. (which again we take for granted, but for him now was almost inaccessible).I connected with the characters in the movie which are very well played. In the end, the movie to me is about a story of how much there is around us, the value of which we realize only when its taken away."
" Well-acted, but incomplete
",2017-05-13 00:00:00,5,"This is a drama film about a mother and five-year-old son who are held prisoner in their captor's shed. The child escapes and the mother is rescued. Then we see them reunited with their family.The acting is good. The huge deficiency of the film is that it starts towards the end of the victims' false imprisonment. They've been there for all of the son's life - and the mother has been there for two years previous to that, since being kidnapped. We don't see any of those years, the kidnapping, or any of the mother's life before she was kidnapped. We see very little of the captor.It's not believable that the captor would believe the story that the mother uses to allow the son to escape.The poster - showing the mother and son smiling at each other - misled us into believing that it's a feel-good film. Being left with PTSD and your rapist-kidnapper-captor's child isn't a happy ending."
" ""We're never anywhere but here.""
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,8,"One has to stay with the film a good long while before anything of an uplifting nature comes along. The first part of the story dealing with Ma (Brie Larson) and son Jack's (Jacob Tremblay) isolation is claustrophobic, depressing and downright creepy at times. Their situation would seem nearly impossible to comprehend, though by now we've had real life examples of similar abductions in which the monstrous perpetrator fathers a child. Consider the cases of Jaycee Dugard and Amanda Berry, both hidden away, virtually in plain sight, as is the case depicted in this film.I found some of the story's concepts interesting, such as young Jack's distorted concept of space and time after exposure to a 'normal' life. The business with the hair and offering the 'strong' to his mother was a unique parallel to the mythology of Samson, and I thought that was cleverly done. I'm on the fence as to why Jack would want to go back to visit 'Room' once he sampled a safe and loving environment, and found it even more baffling that the local police department agreed to accompany him and Ma there.I'm gratified I stayed with the picture because straining through the early part of the story was very disturbing. This isn't the type of movie one ought to consider for entertainment, as the physical and mental abuse suffered by Ma was as harrowing an ordeal as one might find in a war or hostage film. And even though the story ends on a positive note, it's not with a feeling of joy that one eventually comes away with."
" One of the best movies I've ever seen
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,10,"Beautiful in every way. The relationship between the mother and son is so real, you can feel it through the screen. This is a gut wrenching movie and you will likely not get away with a dry eye but it is so worth it. At times, you forget it's a movie because it feels so real. The acting is so amazing given such a difficult situation to portray. I believe Jacob Tremblay deserved an Oscar nomination for completely nailing this complex performance at such a young age. Brie Larson hands down deserved her best actress win. This is a movie I will recommend to everyone I meet, it's THAT good."

" Sensitive and Delicate
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,8,"Joy Newsome (Brie Larson) and her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) live in a small room in a shed without windows and with only a skylight on the roof. When Joy has encounters with a man, Jack locks himself in a closet. When Jack is five years old, Joy tells him that she lived with her parents in a comfortable house and a man called Old Nick lured and kidnapped her seven years ago. Joy plots a scheme to let Jack flee from the room and call the police. When they are rescued, they move to the house of Joy's mother and they have to begin the adaptation to the routine of a normal life. But is it not easy.""Room"" is a sensitive and delicate film with a dramatic and realistic story of woman and child abuse and the effects in the aftermath. The screenplay is very well written increasing tension without the use of cheap means such as graphic violence, sex and gore but only subtle dialogues. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay have awesome performances, showing also fantastic chemistry, and with magnificent supporting cast including names such as Joan Allen and William H. Macy. In the end, ""Room"" is an unforgettable and unique film that touches the viewer's heart. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""O Quarto de Jack"" (""The Room of Jack"")"
" Jacob was so much better than Brie
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,7,"I wanted to see it when i first heard that Miss Larson took the Oscar.Nice film but for me at least she did not deserve it.Jacob Tremblay who deserved it,did not even have a nomination.Why??His performance was perfect and he was the one who made the film successful.So i suggest see it,but not for Brie Larson.She just payed for the Oscar or as we all know she probably did worse things to win it. I also liked some scenes.When Joy committed suicide,it was Jack who was strong for both of them.Also,you expect that when they are free,everything will be easy.But it appears that it is not.So i give a 7 for the script and of course young Jacob."
" I totally recommend this movie.
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,10,"I'm in fond of the main actress.Without revealing the truth, this movie comes in our heart directly so much. We are curious about the fact, that because of that, we just focus on the relationship between their family, not the kidnapper.Also the boy is so brilliant and smart. His angry face has a lot of power. I totally recommend this movie."
" A masterpiece!
",2017-03-30 00:00:00,9,"One of the best films i have seen in a long time. Spinning all of your emotions around one after another. Brie Larson truly reserved to win the academy award for best actress. This truly is a must watch, the story of a young boy and his mother locked away for years and there battle to survive."
" What An Achievement!
",2017-03-23 00:00:00,9,"ROOM is two films, really, complimenting one another and every bit as enthralling in their individual rights. Most impressive about this film is how much thought the writer Emma Donaghue put into her screenplay, not made easier and probably harder by the fact she also wrote the source novel (a surprise and must-read to me!). With help from Director Lenny Abrahamson the film is finely crafted not to waste a word or a moment to embellish the story and suspense. It would be very easy to veer into pathos, melodrama and voyeurism to stir up emotions but such temptations are well avoided. The thrilling scenes in the middle of the film are standing alone worth the watching. The dialog and screenplay skills become most apparent in the second half of ROOM when experiencing Jack's emotional, physical and verbal responses to a world he is unfamiliar with. most apparent in his almost humorous but curiously on-point descriptions of everyday behavior and encounters. I'd have assigned a perfect ""10"" but for the fact that Macy's Dad's reaction Ma's ""descent"" might've been anticipated a bit more. I quibble. Great movie!"
" stripped of the melodrama that hurts most films
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,9,"Another very original movie with a familiar story plot, but concentrates more on the effects of the trauma on the human psyche then any kind of clichéd melodrama. Most movies wouldn't dare to delve as deep as Room does into the effect that a horrifying event can have on a family and the tough choices that people must make which aren't choices at all, but the brutality of life. These two main characters, played brilliantly and unglamorously by Brie Larson and Jacob Trembley, never had a chance at a normal life."
" Inspiring
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,10,"OMG! Absolutely exceptional. The acting is superb especially from a child. And the connection between mother and son is breath taking. I'm not normally "" moved"" by movie but this one has touched my soul. I have to say (and I'm very hard to please) the most captivating film I've seen in a long time"
" Found it too hard to watch this, it was so real!
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,8,"I just wasn't able to watch this, it just seemed so real and so upsetting. The story reminds me of a real life story of a young girl named Jaycee Dugard who was kidnapped by that sicko Philip Garrido and his wife. He raped her and she birthed two girls because of him. She was found there in 2009 and like, it is just so upsetting to think we have these evil b*stards lurking around and wanting to ruin people's lives in so many ways. The pedophile in this movie Old Nick, definitely reminds me of Philip Garrido and Ma as Jaycee Dugard except she birthed a son and not two daughters. Still, this movie was traumatizing enough, you need to be really really strong for this movie and not be feeling like you're throwing up. It is just so sad. I just cant speak more about this, just too hard to watch someone suffer regardless if it was fictional."
" A claustrophobic drama
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,9,"Five year old Jack lives with his mother, Joy, in Room; as far as he is aware there is no outside; Room is all there is. The fact is Joy was abducted seven years previously, when she was seventeen and has been locked in a shed by a captor she has dubbed 'Old Nick' who is of course Jack's father. One day Joy decides it is time to tell Jack the truth about the world and plot their escape. She comes up with a plan and manages to get Jack out and not long afterwards she is free too this isn't the end of their story though; it is merely the first day of the rest of their lives. Jack must come to terms with the vastness of the world and all the new things he sees and Joy must deal with changes that happened while she was in Room; most notably the fact that her parents split soon after her abduction and her father can't bring himself to even look at Jack.This was a really gripping film that turned out to be quite different to what I'd expected. I had assumed the whole film would be similar to the first half with perhaps a few more escape attempts followed by a happy ending where they get free and we see 'Old Nick' brought to justice. In fact they are free around the half way point and while we are told that Nick has been arrested we don't see him again. Instead the second half of the film is all about coming to terms with what happened; or in the case of Joy's father being unable to do so. The room they are held in gives a feel of claustrophobia to such an extent that the world outside suddenly feels huge to the viewer as well as the characters. Brie Larson gave a fantastic performance as Joy; it isn't surprising that she got an Oscar for it. Likewise young Jacob Tremblay was great as Jack; he really made the viewer believe that his character hadn't seen anything of the outside world before. The escape scenes were particularly tense as for some time we had no idea what was happening to Joy; we just knew that 'Old Nick' knew she had helped Jack escape and she was shill his captive. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody looking for something a little different with an emotional intensity."
" like watching a really good trainwreck.
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,9,"there are those films, like 'Schindler's list', that as magnificent as they are, only one viewing is all you can handle. this film is so brilliantly and subtly done, I can sit through it over and over. it is emotionally exhausting, yes, but also SO rewarding. everyone in this film brings their A game to this film, particularly Jacob Tremblay, whose acting ability and vulnerability makes the movie especially Beautiful. Academy Award Winner Brie Larson is exquisite as Ma/Joy, a complex, complicated, nurturing mother but also brutally traumatized kidnap victim and sexual assault survivor. At first I wondered what people were talking about when they said Ma was 'such a good mom' to Jack, as she has her bitchy moments almost from the start of the film, but then i stepped back and realized I'd be that way too. To expect the character to come away unscathed is just unrealistic, but for the years she's in Room, she does a great job sheltering her son from the realities of life until its unbearable. To the people that say Jacob was robbed of an Oscar nomination at least, i would agree, but i would also remind them that doesn't mean Brie's win was not deserved. Her character was MUCH more complex. It's easy to play a kid unaware of a situation, its much harder to play a character that has to deal with the trauma of an event once they're free, and they've got other people watching their kid, so they can just fall apart. I know a lot of people worry about this film and what you see, but as its from the son's perspective, you don't have to worry about anything gratuitous. A Gem of a film I wish everyone would see!"
" Favorite Movie
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,10,Room is one of my favorite movies. It's very simple but it means so much to me - every time I see it I notice different things. There's a lot of reasons why the story goes as it goes. It's really hard to write a review without containing spoilers so I just want to say that it's very powerful and it's worth it 100%. The performance of the actors are so precious and it's worth it so much to see how they work together.

",2017-02-26 00:00:00,9,"It seems like, more and more, the notions of a film being ""an exercise in film-making"" and ""extremely thoughtful/entertaining"" are the antithesis of each other these days. You have your ""Hollywood blockbusters"", your ""art-house fare"", and very little in between. That's why I love the effort that A24 studios (which produced this picture) is making to bring those concepts together. In the past, with films like ""Enemy"", ""Prisons"", and ""Ex Machina"" A24 has succeeded in merging high-concept with pure entertainment. ""Room"" is another success with flying colors in that department.For a basic plot summary (some spoilers), ""Room"" tells the story of Ma (Brie Larson) and her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay). The pair are living in a space that is incredibly confirmed/cramped, and are being held against their will by a mysterious male figure. The only reality that Jacob knows is ""room"", and Ma (after five years) wants to change that. So, they devise an escape plan in hopes of finally being able to revisit the world at large. Their plan does succeed...but only to a certain extant, as the rest of the movie is spent examining the culture shock in returning to their family and what that means for both Ma and Jack.First and foremost, what makes ""Room"" such an intriguing film is that it lets the exposition play out quite nicely in the very beginning. In short, it shows the characters/settings rather than explain them. Much like Ma & Jack, ""room"" is the only universe viewers will know for the first portion of the film, allowing the characters to take center stage in a fascinating way. There is Ma, who knows what is happening, and Jack, who doesn't know anything else besides ""room"". The conversations where she tries to get him to understand the complexity of the world beyond the four walls of their limited existence is almost worth the price of the ticket alone.In order for this to work, however, the acting has to be superb, and in ""Room"" it truly is. Larson (who made her name in the equally brilliant ""Short Term 12"") might take home some hardware for her stunning, emotional performance, while young Tremblay is very believable and apt as a boy going through something that few can even imagine. There isn't a wasted scene in the entire film, as every character interaction and nuance is imbued with significance and deep emotion.""Room"" also manages to transcend its title by not following a predictable arc. I don't want to get into too mainly spoilerish details, but there is as much material outside of ""room"" as in it, following Ma and Jack's struggle to integrate themselves back into society. These parts are just as deeply emotional as the ""room"" scenes since, again, the heavy character development at the beginning sets them up to be so relatable. It will really make you think about the enormity of the entire situation...a jolting emotion considering the claustrophobic smallness of the ""room"" setting.A final area in which ""Room"" will engage audiences is the way in which the camera plays with the notion of space. In ""room"", Ma & Jack are cramped, definitely, but it seems to be a livable space. There is a scene towards the end of the film, however, where they are back in ""room"", and this time (within the context of the outside world) it looks so incomprehensibly tiny. It truly is all about perspective and mindset...and a wonderful director in Lenny Abrahamson.So, if you are looking for a cinematic experience that is equal parts mind-stretching, emotional, funny, and tragic, ""Room"" fits all the bills. It has the polished feel of an Academy Award-type picture, yet the spirit of a movie that knows no bounds when it comes to characters, emotions, and settings. A24 has done it again."
" The World
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,6,"Abducted and held in a backyard shed with a young son fathered by her captor, a young woman attempts to escape in this grim drama starring Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. Some of the finer plot details do not quite add up (in seven years of captivity, she should have been able to work out a four digit security code) and the first half of the movie is a tad repetitive. Things gets more interesting in the second half though with the escape plan in action and superb point-of-view shots as we literally and metaphorically see the world for the first time through the young boy's eyes. Tremblay is excellent as the youngster in question; not all his temper tantrums ring true, but he is great in the quieter moments in which he simply sits back and observes. In fact, the film is more about Tremblay than Larson even though she was the one who garnered all the awards attention. With all the focus on Tremblay though, several plot points feel undernourished; an impending trial, having to eventually tell Trembley who his father is, and acceptance of Trembley into the family are all issues that are mentioned once or twice and then later forgotten. Some have complained that the film runs too long but the ending comes as abrupt if anything with so many avenues left open. The uncertainty is arguably fitting though, and with two very solid lead performances, this is a hard film to look away from, but its resonance will vary depending upon how one feels about all the issues and ideas here that are unexplored to make room for its depiction of a boy seeing the world for the first time."
" Room
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,10,"A young mother with a son, Jack, lives in Room. It is literally that, a room with a bed, TV, sink, miniature stove, table, bathtub and a closet. They are seemingly a very loving little family with no other figure in their lives except for one person. This leads to questions which leads to further discovery of what is really going on with Room. I will leave this plot synopsis at that as I discovered this film without knowing nothing about the plot and was extremely grateful to see this uncovering what Room was.Room is a movie that really surprised the world. Brie Larson took home the academy award for best actress in a leading role and rightfully so. Her performance is utterly breathtaking and a risk taker as you find out the situation she is in and admire that she has created this magical world for her son while she's in a deep depression and put through the ringer almost every night. The major shock is that her co-star Jacob Tremblay was not nominated as well as this is one of the best child performances I had ever seen on film. The interaction between the two is absolutely memorizing, giving the clear message of how love can heal a tragic situation. Jacob does not come off as too cute or too annoying, but as a normal child. He gets happy, gets scared and hides in his mother's arms, he gets angry and yells, gets frustrated and denies problems like a child would. Joan Allen gives a great performance as well as Brie's mother, conveying the love, confusion and frustration of how to handle something wonderful coming back into your life but under tragic circumstances. It truly is an actor's film and the casting director couldn't have had more spot on.The direction is also very good, Lenny Abrahamson has this film almost 100% perfect. One of the things I really appreciated about Room is that it reminded me of what being a child is like. The first time we discover things and how your parents are your world. As you discover how large the world is, it feels like the knowledge is endless and you want to consume more and more. The scene where Jack sees the sky I will never forget and I couldn't stop crying that I had to pause the movie. So many things that we take for granted we see it through the eyes of a child and that's the best way to view things at times. Also through Brie's eyes as she comes back into the world after being gone and not feeling part of it as well. It shows truly how great the story was written and followed with a solid script.The one flaw I found with the film, which is a nitpick, I would have had William H. Macy in it a little more. He plays Brie's father and does a very good job and the scene at the dinner table where he cannot even look at Jack and Brie just breaks down begging him to accept her son. He leaves and it's heartbreaking but also human and you can understand why as frustrating as you want him to stay and be there for his daughter. A small spoiler, Brie ends up in the hospital again, but he's not even mentioned. He seems like a loving father who genuinely wants his daughter in his life, wouldn't he be a least a mention as to why he's not there? It's a small nitpick, but a legit question.Other than that, this is a terrific film and is my favorite of 2015. I highly recommend watching it without knowing too much about the plot as more is revealed, you get the true emotion the writer and director had intended you to connect with. It is a very emotional movie as well, I cried at least 3 times, so have a box of tissues ready."
" amazing
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,10,"I have read this book and I loved it and I was hooked. I was so so excited when I found out that there was going to be a movie! Jacob Tremblay is so powerful, inspiring, and adorable in this movie! The chemistry between him and Brie Larson and is so beautiful! This is such an inspiring story about survival, hope, and family. What makes room so powerful is because the majority of the book and the movie is in the ""room"" and how Jacob Tremblay's imagination is in ""room"" is so so amazing! My sister cried when she saw it in theater's and I didn't because I don't cry easily at movies but if I did I would be bawling my eyes out. This movie isn't for everyone, but for those who can handle seeing abuse, etc go see this movie! :)"
" A Room Without A View You Wont Forget Easily
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,9,"When the four main components that make a movie better than average are brought together the result can be striking. First, is the importance of a good script with a strong story that many should be able to relate to & when this essential element has its basis in fact, it's already well ahead. Emma Donoghue's script supplies all this. Follow with a director who has a personal passion to bring this particular story to life & Irish born (of Eastern Jewish parentage) Lenny Abrahamson was the right choice. If Performers have a large role in convincing us to care and feel for the subjects they play - this film certainly has those! Next comes someone to create images that will draw us into each situation and with Award nominee Cinematographer Danny Cohen ('The Kings Speech') this is almost perfectly achieved. I say almost, as the 11 x 11ft set he was given to capture a large degree of his shots in would have been extremely limiting - this no doubt created obstacles i'm sure everyone would have preferred to do without (referring to a couple of clumsy but minor, hand help shots). A sympathetic producer who wants the best result caps a good production off. Stephen Rennick's sensitive Music Score and carefully detailed Editing lifts this work even higher. Multi-talented Brie Larson certainly earned her well deserved Oscar as 'Ma', with young Jacob Tremblay surprisingly impressive as son Jack. All cast members work hard to make this harrowing film unfold in a naturalistic manner. When generally mindless 'action' movies win massive amounts of Awards and spend obscene amounts of money achieving this – it's refreshing when a life affirming gem like 'Room' comes along to add balance to the industry. With the task of pleasing everybody being just about impossible - some won't be able to relate to 'Room's' highly claustrophobic, personal situations so, the hard and fast action aficionados won't understand the accolades. Others will be astounded and may even come back for a second visit. If being technical, I'm perhaps a little perplexed as how the 'garden shed' with its skylight kept the screams out of neighbor's ear range and the captors in for so long but, perhaps this demented captor had rebuilt the internals with heavily padded materials - I understand the original situation this story is based on took place in a European cellar (not sure why this was altered). Maybe the captor was also overly naive in not checking the body in the carpet (?). Other than these plot details , 'Room' is not to be missed by appreciators of discerning films."
" The Emotional Journey Of Joy And Jack
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,10,"The Academy Award gave the Best Actress Oscar to Brie Larson in this film about a young woman Joy who was imprisoned in a certain shed together with her five-year-old son Jack who was born in captivity by an old man entitled ""Room"".No question that many critics and viewers alike found it to be a wonderful film.Director Lenny Abrahamson provides an emotional journey of Joy as well as Jack and how she managed to use her intelligence,imagination and creativity to relieve herself of their situation especially in bringing up her son Jack inside the shed and how they cope and adapt to the outside world after being in captivity for many years.Jacob Tremblay,Joan Allen,Sean Bridgers and William H. Macy also stars in it. No question that it was touching movie during the first part of the film.We get to see how Joy to remedy their situation with the use of their imagination especially when Joy teaches many things about the world to Jack.Things become extremely difficult especially as Jack gets old and shows above average intelligence.At the beginning of the movie,we see the pain and suffering she has to go through as well as her determination to survive despite their situation.Being an overprotective mother,she also tries to satisfy sexually her captor Old Nick in exchange for their various items for her son. Luckily,they were able to remedy their situation and found a way to escape.While the movie was compelling the first part, the second part somehow fell short as it wasn't as interesting unlike when Joy and Jack were kept in the shed.When Joy reunited with her parents, I felt that the screenplay focused too on the emotional mother-and-daughter relationship between Joy and Jack and losing sight somewhat on the progress of the story as many issues were left for the audience to think about and discuss among themselves.That includes difficulties they are about to face upon adapting to the outside world after many years of captivity;how Joy's father is going to accept Jack knowing that it was fathered by Old Nick;how Joy is going to go on with her new life as woman in her 20's;and the difficulties Jack as a child is trying face to adapt to his ""new world"" outside the shed.It would have been a masterpiece if not too many questions were left for the audience to answer and some issues were explored further for the continuation of the story.They could have at least shown a character development in both Joy and Jack from inside to outside the shed.Overall,Room was worth the price of admission despite the progress of the story was lacking in the second part after the escape.Both Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay captured the mother-and-daughter relationship perfectly.No question that Brie Larson deserved to win the Best Actress Oscar as the viewer will definitely empathize with her character Joy.Jacob Tremblay developed a wonderful chemistry with Larson although he could be annoying at times.He also showed strength emotionally to her mom especially in times of emotional pain and difficulties outside the shed.Their performances for me was so great that it somehow made me gave it the highest rating despite the second part.Finally,the viewers will definitely be touched with this movie experience especially for women around the world as the theme of motherhood was fully explored especially even in the most difficult and adverse circumstances."
" Good Bye Jack
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,9,"Every Thing is normal because it is familiar to you not because it is normal. Do you wanna understand what this means?! Just GO and see the is masterpiece.A very emotional experience that deserves all of our respect. You wouldn't even Know what is the best thing in the movie, Is it the acting, Is it the emotion? Is it the screenplay ? Is it Jack ?! I think it's definitely Room.You are about to watch a new respectable talent of a 9 years old boy Jacob Tremblay who had shown me the best performance by a young actor I have ever seen, and we cannot forget our academy award winner Brie Larson who definitely deserved every award she got.This movie deserves every minute of your time."
" It's tough, nail-biting, intense and immersive, but it is genuine and heart-felt, uplifting and inspiring.
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,10,"This is a story so sublimely told and exquisitely crafted, and with performances so achingly beautiful and emotive, it would be near impossible not to pull on the tightest of heart strings.Every frame is a deliberate exploration into the themes of maternity, creation and endless opportunity; uplifting messages founded on a dark premise. The consistency of Lenny Abrahamson's masterful direction and the stunning performances make this an utterly overwhelming experience. Abrahamson even utilises an incredible score at key moments which builds to such an intense crescendo, it manages to crawl under the skin and hold you transfixed on the scene.It's tough, nail-biting, intense and immersive, but it is genuine and heart-felt, uplifting and inspiring. This is a film that requires repeated viewings as the sheer subtleties within every scene and on every facial expression demand close attention in order to appreciate the pure brilliance that is 'Room'.For the full review, and further movie reviews, please visit: https://www.facebook.com/JMCReelReviews/"
" One of those small movies that deserve much more than what will ever be given
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,7,"This is a movie I saw because it was nominated for the Oscars. I had to see the one to make the bet. Thank God I make the bet, I have come to see this great movie. Although I think that it has several shortcomings of script, that will explain in zone spoiler, still I think that it knows them to surpass more and goes ahead. Also hooks and you want to continue watching.The actors are great. If I'm not mistaken they are all unknown but that does not stop them from being great. Even the child and it is not easy to do.The picture is not very good outdoors, but to make a credible film is enough.Even if you do not have nice blueprints or composites. The director, if he knows how to take the film forward. When the thread is finished, it knows how to change and move on and that is very difficult.Spoiler:For me the problem with the script is that I think that the idea of ​​the room ends quickly and then it has to continue somewhere. You are watching it and you do not know what happens until you discover it, but when you discover it, you do not know where it is going to go, but it is still on one side and still very well. At the second turning point, the same thing happens exactly as well.Another great thing about the movie, which plays the script is that of acceptance. Will the grandparents accept their grandchild born of rape? It is a pleasure to meet these jewels that the world of cinema offers us."
