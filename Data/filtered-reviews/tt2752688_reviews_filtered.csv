" a beautiful coincidence
",2019-06-14 00:00:00,8,"I stumbled upon the film by accident .. and i am so glad i did !! i have heard about Mr. Bahri story vaguely before , and i am so excited to start the search journey about him - the cast were sublime and Gabriel moved me although he is not Iranian . and i liked the fact that they showed the anti hero aspect of him , i adored the scene of the footage he took when he talked with the young protesters and i cant feel but that this happens all over the world ( Sudan )"
" THE PERSIAN MASSAGE
",2019-05-30 00:00:00,10,"The film is based on a true story that would be funny it it wasn't true. Bahari (Gael Garc√≠a Bernal) is a News Week journalist (I'm sorry.) He is a native of Iran reporting on the election in 2009. He does a gag interview Jason Jones (Jason Jones) for ""The Daily Show"" where Jason claims to be a spy for the US. Iran uses this to arrest Bahari.Most of the film is Bahari in his jail cell. Sometimes he is by himself, sometimes he is being questioned, and at other times he is having an imaginary conversation with his father, a one time guest of the same prison. Amazingly, it was enough to keep me interested.This is a debut film writing and directing for Jon Stewart of the same ""Daily Show."" Jon has recently announced his retirement from said show and hopefully he will present us with more hard hitting political gems such as ""Rosewater.""Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" Its a purchased campaign, not a film
",2018-09-28 00:00:00,1,"It is very obvious that this movie is a failed attempt of an american campaign. Its not working anymore. This is nothing to do with art. Even though i do not like iran type of governments, this movie is overrated example of an advertisement. Do not waste your time.."
" Excellent example of psychological and physical manipulation and torture.
",2018-02-23 00:00:00,9,I was fascinated by Iranian methods of interrogation of prisoners. It really looked like gas-lighting and twisting of reality. There was a haunting pretense of pseudo civility followed by pure evil.
" Freedom
",2017-12-09 00:00:00,8,"Jon Stewart. Comedian. Astute political commentator. Filmmaker. He isn't known for the latter, but he should be. Since he is long finished with his reign on The Daily Show, he must consider making more films. Rosewater is a triumph. A strong cry for resistance of despotic regimes worldwide. A loud roar for freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Maziar Bahari is not fake news. He has a story that makes us all thankful that the monstrous Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is no longer in power. The interrogation scenes made me cringe in compassion for all political prisoners. Jon Stewart wanted to make a powerful statement and he succeeded. He's proved to be a provocateur with his on-stage persona.. but his filmmaking skills are equally as provoking."
