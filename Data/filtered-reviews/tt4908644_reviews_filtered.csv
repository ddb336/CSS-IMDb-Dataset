" Enlightenment
",2021-03-02 00:00:00,7,Watched this because I have neighbors from the Ukraine and I wanted to see what their fight for freedoms looked like. A heart breaking scenario that still exists in this modern world and it is good to be aware.
" Winter on Fire
",2021-02-03 00:00:00,9,"This was incredibly disturbing to watch even though I had seen most of it before from news clips and YouTube. For whatever reason I didn't realise the protests lasted that long. They shouldn't have lasted that long.The documentary was very eye opening, well put together and interesting to watch overall.
The most disturbing part were the Berkut. I hope they feel shameful to this day. Imagine beating and shooting peaceful protests. I'm glad they got disbanded."
" Good documentary
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,9,"Well, in my opinion the film is actually the true representation of all the happenings on Maidan, the people were like going to Maidan to be Europe, after the violence, Ukraine could not resist and people were going for freedom and dignity like, people were not for a political party or regime, they were free people and the government wanted to steal that freedom. For me, as a Ukrainian, the movie means a lot. Strongly recommend.
P.S. One of the weak points is that the film doesn't explain everything in that ""detail"", for example, there were symbols of ultra-right communities like Reichskomissariat Ukraine, SS Galytskyyna, etc.. Maybe if they could explain something about and what does it mean, it would be 10 stars...
Hello to Edu and 3d ESO there!"

" Strong Documentary on a Revolution
",2020-08-10 00:00:00,9,"Winter on Fire: Ukraine's Fight for Freedom is a 2015 Netflix-produced documentary, directed by Evgeny Afineevsky, which focuses on the ninety days of protests, referred to as the Euromaidan Protests, that spanned from November 2013 to February 2014, which eventually toppled the government of Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. It was set off when this leader of the Eastern European country, a former Soviet Republic, refused to sign a trade agreement with the European Union, which the people wanted and which he had said he would sign, in order to pay favor to Russia and Vladimir Putin. The people see the cronyism and the corruption, and are determined to peacefully show their displeasure, in the streets, eventually numbering in the thousands. The government doesn't take kindly to this popular uprising, feeling threatened easily by public opposition (as autocratic regimes often do), and sets about to repress and squash their movement. The response from the people is, as has occurred with authoritarians doing similar oppression, is to not cower but step up harder and louder and grow their movement.Putting the politics aside--though I don't think it should be in any way be considered a controversial statement that the government acted in a very bad way--this is a fantastic, disturbing, and beyond all a riveting documentary, including amazing footage placing you in the heart of these heart-stopping scenes and put together well. It shows very well how the movement started and how it grew. I think I even liked this better than another really strong Netflix doc about a similar kind of revolution in Egypt earlier in the decade, the award-winning The Square, though this is many ways is a slighter film. I believe the narrower focus, putting it on these specific protests and the governments overreaction, works to its benefit. Afineevsky received both Academy Award and Emmy nominations for the film, which on the one hand I find strange, because the two award shows are clearly in separate entertainment entities, and a work probably shouldn't be eligible for both; on the other hand, I can't say he wasn't deserving for both nomination (the same thing happened to the director of The Square Jehane Noujaim, won some Emmys for it). I highly recommend seeing this documentary."
" Shocking! Inspirational!
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,9,"This is one of my favourite documentaries for many reasons. This doco is quite shocking in many ways - the lengths to which the police brutality goes to, but also how this whole conflict seemed to be but a brief mention in many countries news bulletins. I couldn't believe that these events were not more widely shared on social media, news outlets and that there wasn't worldwide outrage at these crimes. Sadly, it seems to me that this would've happened if it occurred in a country like my home country, New Zealand, but because it was based in the Ukraine, it seems like many Western countries just don't care enough.Winter on Fire had me crying and feeling emotional throughout all its heroic and sadly fatal moments. There are so many heroes in this story, and so many positives on display of what non-violent protesting can accomplish and how bad it can make your opposers look. I'm sure this was something the people of Ukraine were very proud of. The footage in this doco is truly amazing, both those who courageously filmed it and also the giant admin task of collecting it altogether and putting it in one place to tell such a compelling story. This doco moved me and also gave me such a feeling of rage to the injustices presented here.It's very sad to think that these things are still possible in our day, and these docos need to be made continually to show how truly evil the human heart without God can be. Selfishness and a thirst for power or dominion at all costs is an ugly human trait, but the unity, grit, passion and courage of the very same people shines so clearly. Some of the more compelling scenes were those of the mothers pleading with the armed forces to remember the Ukraine of their youth and that they could change sides.This is not for causal viewing and this story needs to be told, not swept under the rug, hidden, ignored or forgotten."
" Perfect Winter
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Most viewers who see this don't realize what they are watching. In fact the viewers who have watched this documentary can consider themselves to be in the decimal dust of concerned citizens. There was a popular phrase during the revolution. My prekrasno ponimali. We understood perfectly. We understood perfectly that we were not going back, only forward. Its no coincidence that Ukraine is in the news today. The players here have not gone away they are impacting American politics today. If you have the time to dig deeper do so. You won't regret it."
" Pro-nazi propaganda
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,1,"This propaganda film tries to delete the fact that the Maidan coup was carried out by neo-nazi and fascist forces. Even though the filmmakers tried to cut out all the nazi imagery from the footage, there was so much fascist stuff in Maidan that the filmmakers has failed to notice it all. In the movie there are several swastikas, Bandera, right sector and black suns and so on in the protests which the filmmakers doesn't even comment about! They also ignore the murderous arson which killed many people set by the ukrainian fascists at a union building. They never comment on how ""Azov"" and other terrorists and thugs abuse people. Thumbs down to this nazi-apologist film."
" A teardroping struggle for the one holly cause, a homeland.
",2020-01-13 00:00:00,10,"For someone who's living at the moment were Iraqis are continuing the October uprising, i find nothing on the media that could relate to the fight for freedom more than this documentary does."
" The power of people
",2019-11-21 00:00:00,10,"Very strong movie. I do not presume to disassemble this work in detail, but the dignity of the participants in the Revolution in Ukraine is shown very well.The charm of this film is that we see different characters, which the author does not decorate in any way. Which in life, and shown in the film. That's cool.There is a historical context, even if some doubts arise. The film is very accessible and the fact that the point of view of the east of Ukraine is ignored does not bother me. The events of the Revolution of Dignity or Euromaidan are shown, and in the east of the country until the spring of 2014 it was quiet and no one there was concerned about the Kiev events.If you can think, then you should watch this movie. Unlike the propaganda of Oliver Stone and the position of Russia, this film shows reality."
" Winter on fire??
",2018-03-03 00:00:00,1,"You mean alike the fire through which on May 2, 2014 31 pro-Russia protesters who were cornered in the lobby of some trade union building in Odessa and who were locked inside by the ""freedom fighters"" and then set on fire and burned alive? You mean like THIS fire? Or it is some other type of fire that you have in mind? Like, for example, the heavy mortars' and howitzer weapons' fire that leveled the village of Adreyevka in Donetsk region in late May 2014? The same indiscriminate heavy artillery fire via which the Ukrainians annihilated many other small towns and villages throughout Lugansk and Donetsk since 2014?Yeah, that must be the one... Right? RIGHT??"
" Seen 837 movies so far and this is the most heart-breaking an touching one.
",2017-12-18 00:00:00,10,"Made by Netflix, it has the potential (by that I mean a strong budget) to be great. But it is not about that. For this documentary, the budget is irrelevant because all the materials that this film is made of were made during those winter 2013-2014 days and nothing like budget, soundtrack, cast, filming crew, etc is rellevant...Everything is done in order to make the ordinary viewer to understand a little bit of recent history. This movie is about the feeling that transmits to its viewers and it is absolutely heart-breaking. It is so powerful, that after watching it, it make you think about it for the rest of your life. A truly must-watch, a perfect masterpiece. After 2 years of watching it 3 times, I am (still) waiting for something better, but I can not find any."
" Finally, the truth is told!
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,10,"""Ukraine on Fire"": Oliver Stone's Documentary. U.S. Sponsored ""Coup"". Neo-Nazis are being used by the Ukrainian Government. ""That Whole Process was Headquartered in the US Embassy"" (former Ukraine president Yanukovitch). Nobody should feel safe today At the time, when the western governments and media have been lying to the world about what's really been happening in Ukraine, this is a must-see documentary to learn the truth. Can this happen in the US? Yes, it can. The same people, who had organized and funded the Ukrainian armed coup, followed by an ongoing civil war, are currently organizing and funding the same thing in our country as well. History does not forgive ignorance: if we don't know the history, we deem to repeat it. Please watch this film and share it with as many people as you can."
" Winter on Fire: Ukraine's Fight for Freedom
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,5,"I found this Ukrainian documentary film on Netflix, the only reason I wanted to see it originally was because of its Oscar nomination, I knew nothing about it, apart from that it was a serious subject matter. Basically the film focuses on the Euromaidan protests in Ukraine during 2013 and 2014. It started with peaceful student demonstrations for the support of European integration, but then it turned into violent revolution and a full-fledged civil rights movement, calling for President Viktor F. Yanukovich to announce his resignation. The conflict lasted for ninety-three days, but many similar small wars are still occurring in European countries, with many deaths and casualties continuing. The filming is all from the perspectives of the public cameras on the scene and the many televised news reports, it is shocking to see the amount of blood and death for what was supposed to be peaceful, I admit having to read the subtitles was a little annoying, but it got my attention, and it is an interesting controversial documentary. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Documentary. Worth watching!"
" For Ukraine! For Freedom!
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,10,"There comes a time where you have to ask yourself, what does ""one sided"" in a conflict where unarmed people are getting mauled, shot and kidnapped by the police means? If you want to act like a detached ""expert"", yes this film had a one sided narrative, but even in conflicts there are truth. There are the will of the people, the right of the people, and the necessity for everyone to be heard. If we lose that, we have lost to tyranny, to corruption, to brutalization.Let's ask all the people here giving this documentary one or two stars what they would like to hear from the other side? How the crackdown of peaceful protests were justified. Bullshit. Violence is never justified.Watch this documentary. Just do it. You won't regret it.Freedom for the people. By the people. For Ukranie!"
