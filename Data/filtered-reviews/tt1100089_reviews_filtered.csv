" Fails to flourish
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,4,"Full of dramatic scenes that have had the drama sucked right out of them. This results in a bland film full of pastel moments instead of something that could have been very dynamic.
It had all the ingredients, power, money, envy, mental health issues, elite sport and so on but fails to capitalise on any of those elements fully.Du Pont spends most of his time moping around the house like he has a soiled nappy and Mark Schultz isn't far behind him.The performances of the 3 leads are ok but they aren't really given enough to work with.Everything felt muted."
" Money can't buy you self-love
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,10,"An interesting and thought-provoking film.John DuPont is a god amongst men. He wields tremendous power at the stroke of a pen. He can buy all sorts of people. Against the wishes of his mother the Nero-like DuPont decided to buy a wrestling team.But what DuPont can't buy is love. At his very core is a negative core belief. He believes that in and of himself he has no intrinsic value. That his value is measured by how much money he is worth. As a result he is constantly on high alert for those who wish to deprive him of his money and forever trying to work out who is and who isn't genuine. This creates a massive schism on his psyche.There are two John DuPonts. The secret John who hates himself and knows itself to be a fraud and worthless, and the public John Who is respectable and noble and whom everyOne flatters and panders to. These two characters are forever at war with one another and eventually one will prevail.Great performances from Carrell who plays the emotionally bankrupt John so well I didn't recognise him. Channing Tatum continues to impress with his diverse abilities as an actor. Mark Ruffalo providing a solid performance and likeness to the real David Schultz."
" Something missing that stops this film from reaching the next level
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,8,"There's a lot to love about Foxcatcher, the most notable being the performances. Steve Carrell gave a transformative performance as John Du Pont, which was the real highlight of the film. His energy was so sinister and engaging, and whenever he was on screen was when Foxcatcher was at its best. Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo also gave great performances, particularly Channing who thrived in exploring the more tortured elements of his character.My criticism would be that the film maybe lacked a bit of structure. I was never quite sure who our protagonist was, and I didn't find myself overly excited by or drawn into either Schultz brothers. The intriguing bit of this story was the relationship between Du Pont and the Schutz's, and I don't think this was explored enough. I would have liked the wrestling to take more of a back seat and for the characters and their relationships to be explored more.Don't get me wrong, there was good character development and exploration, but in the wrong places at times. I just didn't find a connection with either of the brothers, and this was the films major failing for me which stops it getting a 9 or 10.I would definitely encourage anybody to watch Foxcatcher though, particularly lovers of drama and sports. It has a lot of brilliant elements and the story is bizarre. If the third act doesn't have your jaw hitting the floor then I don't know what will!"
" Perfect
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,10,If you ever wrestled in your life or just enjoy the sport and all the struggles that come along with it please give this amazing movie a watch. Steve carrel won multiple awards for this movie and it shows. His performance was outstanding and is nothing like you've ever seen before. I think mark ruffalo did a 10/10 on portraying a wrestler/ coach while trying to get his younger brother on a better path.
" Watch it for Carrell, Tatum and Ruffalo's performances alone
",2020-10-11 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed Bennett Miller's Moneyball despite my lack of interest in baseball and Foxcatcher is another sports drama directed by him but it's one I like even more.Foxcatcher follows Olympic wrestlers Mark and Dave Schultz who join Team Foxcatcher led by the rich John du Pont but eventually the relationship between these three turns sour.I strongly suggest NOT to read anything about the story as it may spoil a lot of crucial details.Miller's previous film Moneyball was decent and had some great dialogue and performances. Whilst Foxcatcher is another sports drama, this one takes more of a dark turn. I really liked the dark and unsettling tone to this movie as I felt it fit perfectly with the story and its characters. The atmosphere created adds so much to the experience and makes the ending of this film even more surprising than it already is. Unlike Moneyball, where the dialogue takes centre stage, Foxcatcher has lot more quiet scenes where you soak in the melancholy feeling of it all with the great music and cinematography. The pacing is quite slow and the slow burn aspect may not work for some people but the story and characters kept me invested and made the runtime not feel as long.What will keep people interested in this film are the fantastic performances by these three commendable actors. I've always loved Steve Carrell as a comedic actor and to see him play a more serious role was very surprising and I have to see Carrell is truly amazing here. The prosthetic makeup was really good as it helped sell the fact that we were seeing John du Pont rather than Steve Carrell and he really managed to make du Pont a creepy and mysterious individual. Mark Ruffalo gives another great performance. He played the role of a loving and caring brother really well.
Last but not least, Channing Tatum was extraordinary. I've known Tatum through comedies like the Jump Street films but he really shows what he's capable of in Foxcatcher. Tatum fully embodied the troubled nature of Mark Schultz and there were a couple subtleties in his performance that really elevated it.I really liked Foxcatcher. The performances by Carrell, Tatum and Ruffalo are the highlights and despite its slow pacing, the compelling story and ominous atmosphere kept me engaging through its entirety."
" All together - very well done film!
",2020-09-24 00:00:00,10,"Minor spoilers at the bottom. Nothing specificI watched this movie without knowing a lot about the real life situation. It's moved me to want to look into it more.Steve Carrel was unbelievable in this movie, as was Tatum and Ruffalo. The music and cinematography gave the it that erie feel the whole time. You can really see how the three main characters seem to rarely show happiness, if all, and how that affects all three of their lives.I highly recommend this movie to anyone. A real life tragedy portrayed amazingly though the art of film"
" Authentic but still quite cold and dry
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,6,"Most of what I heard about Foxcatcher before watching it was solely about the makeup work done to transform Steve Carell into John du Pont, and Mark Ruffalo into David Schultz (admittedly, it was pretty remarkable.) Thankfully, that meant the rest of the true story was a mystery to me. There was a definite sense of tension building throughout the film, but not because of anything the filmmakers did. The mounting tension was more because I knew something was going to happen (why else would this be a story worth telling,) and it seemed virtually anything was possible considering the strange personality of John du Pont. I only wish it was told in a more compelling fashion. Foxcatcher is an extremely stark and silent film. Seldom do we see emotions expressed, but they are merely implied through the behavior of the characters, and some subtleties in the performances from the actors.In a way, Foxcatcher felt like a documentary. It's quite flat and free of any excitement. The finale of the movie could easily feel like it came out of nowhere because there is no build to the plot. Of course, if you were paying attention up to that point you can pick up on the clues that it was going to happen. I know there are many people who will appreciate the dispassionate and matter-of-fact way this story is presented, but I'm a sucker for a more dramatized version of events to make a movie based on a true story more cinematic. The acting performances were definitely the highlight of Foxcatcher, particularly what Steve Carell brought to the story. Even though I was worried I might get a little bored with the film, and the conclusion was underwhelming, the acting always kept me engaged. It's not a movie I'll revisit, but if you're looking for authentic story-telling in a true story, Foxcatcher might be for you."
" Unnerving from beginning to end
",2020-09-15 00:00:00,8,"This movie is extremely unnerving from beginning to end, and having knowledge of how the story ends only makes it more unnerving.This is a slow movie. Like, a very slow movie. But thanks to the fantastic performamces from Channing Tatum, Steve Carell and Mark Ruffalo, the pace never becomes an issue.While I don't think this is a movie I would want to rewatch, it is one that must be seen. It's really damn good."
" Steve Carrel absolutely best performance!
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,9,"Used to see Steve Carrel in all sorts of comedy but I had to check twice to be sure that this is the same actor. Absolutely amazing transformation.
Brilliant actor."
" Still waiting.
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,4,"I was very excited for this movie. I figured it was going to be a very dark psychological movie with strong characters and a fascinating character study. It was indeed dark and psychological, but it was very emotionally hollow.I found no reason to care about any of the characters. The story is wrong as the Schultz brothers weren't at Foxcatcher at the same time. Also, Dave Schultz and John Du Pont had a different relationship than portrayed.I was waiting the entire movie for something to happen. There was an ending, but it was so hollow and anti-climactic that I just didn't care.I don't recommend this movie."
" Sensible, not very factual
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,6,During the movie you could really feel the tension between the three main characters and the will to accept the situation given the good salaries and wealthy living condition and just doing the thing they wanted to be best at: wrestling. Very well explained.The thing what's not explained well is the truth. There's a lot of movie content different than the actual truth.
" Wrestling...
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,7,"""Foxcatcher"" is a Biography - Sport movie in which we watch the life story of Schultz brothers when they joined the ""Team Foxcatcher"" and they were living and training in John du Pont's mansion for the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea. They were both members of U.S. Olympic wrestling team and the have won Olympic medals.I liked this movie very much because it is based on real life events and because it was very interesting since it had a well-written script and a very interesting plot. The interpretations of both Steve Carell who played as John du Pont and Channing Tatum who played as Mark Schultz were simply amazing. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Mark Ruffalo's who played as David Schultz and he was equally good. I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie because it is very interesting and it presents very well the true events of the team Foxcatcher."
" Ridiculous Movie full with ridiculous Actors
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,1,"For starters this C-HollyW is so far from actual reality it should be under conspiracy wishes. Carell is not ever going to be an actual actor, he was ..whats the word.. where youre late in french and Re do that everytime in life??
This is horsesh it with no radish - go watch the ACTUAL documentary,
Stop giving useless liars for hire your attention, money and time."
" Very late review I know
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,9,"I'm making this review 6 years after the release of the film because, I have seen it 2 times in the past but don't think I firmly grasp the meaning of the movie. Now I'm 18 and know that the film is about arrogance, selfishness, and mostly conceited ness. This whole film is about family and who do you trust, your angels or your demons. Each character has there own important story. Mark is a Olympic gold medalist and wants to become that worlds greatest wrestler, Dave is also a Olympic gold medalist and has a wife and children and isn't focused just in wrestling, and John du Pont is a selfish greedy man who grew up living with a weight on his back and the weight on his back are ""the horses."" His mom loved horses and hated the idea of wrestling. It's a very slow burning movie, definitely on the back burner, but it gives a message to the audience that ""you never really know people"" and also ""money doesn't solve things"" it's not the money, it's the people. Brilliantly acted by Steve Carrell and Mark Ruffalo. The story was really awesome and I'm glad I got to review it."
" Too long yet a lot missing
",2020-03-22 00:00:00,2,"Having read the full story about John du Pont and what supposedly happened to him mentally, I am not sure why so much detail was missed from this unnecessarily long film. A good cast and some quality acting let down by a lack of dialogue and a poorly delivered plot. This could have been great film but was instead very dull and boring. Thankfully it was available to watch for free because I would have resented paying for it."
" I couldn't help feeling that, in the end, they reaped what they sowed...
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,6,"Steve Carell is really good as the enigmatic John du Pont, a millionaire who takes the Schultz brothers - a duo of American Olympic wrestling champions under his wing. Channing Tatum is pretty wooden as Mark with Mark Ruffalo much better as his sibling David. The story focuses more on the erratic, downright selfish behaviour of du Pont as he desperately seeks some sort of validation which; despite his enormous wealth, he needs more than anything from his contemporaries. The brothers become little more than his pawns, and soon it all begins to impact on their wellbeing and sanity - not to mention their success as sportsmen. The story is interesting, but there's no getting away from the rather mediocre performance from Tatum. Vanessa Redgrave pops up occasionally as Jean du Pont (the mother) and at times Bennett Miller almost had me invest enough in the pair to care; but in the end I just didn't - and at over 2 hours it started to become more of a marathon to watch than to run."
" What money can buy
",2020-03-16 00:00:00,7,"Money can buy him friendship. Money can't buy him respect from a ""low life"" and love from him mother."
" Interesting But Flawed
",2020-03-12 00:00:00,5,"I've never heard of this interesting story before so thought I'd give it a try. The result is a very well acted but very slow story of jealousy, loneliness and desire for acceptance... dressed up in a wrestling theme. The problem is there's just not enough here for a movie. DuPont is very very weird from the start. The kind of guy who offered you 20k to sleep on his estate and wrestle you you'd run a mile from. Once you get over his missives not being gay ones then there is not a lot left. He's just a miserable lonely rich guy with no friends who fixates on wrestling. So not really worth watching. The ending is god damn awful as well. I mean after the main event we catchup with the brother and nothing is said. It just ends. Terrible. Five stars for the acting. 2 stars for the script. 3 stars for the story."
" WOW, GREAT DEPECTION OF TRUE EVENTS - RICHIE RICH GOES OFF THE RAILS
",2020-02-20 00:00:00,9,"Unbelievable story and even more so since it was based on true events. The story of John Dupont of the Dupont Fortune fits the stereotype of ""Richie Rich"" with no friends except those paid to be there. This film makes you appreciate being an ""average Joe"" with an average life.
I didn't watch this movie until 2020 and I'm sorry it took me this long to find it!
John Dupont seems to have had some underlying mental problems, drug and alcohol abuse only exacerbated by his disapproving mother who held the purse strings to the family fortune. Dupont spent his entire life trying to get her approval which never came.
There are a number of story lines going on here....
1. The family dynamics of the Duponts and the power play between parent and child
2. The ups and downs of olympic athletes and how they make a living after their moment of glory
3. How anything can be bought given the right circumstances
I was not familiar with this story until I saw the movie...it left me sad for days."
" Hmmmm
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,2,"I'll keep this brief; there are some excellent acting performances throughout this film. However, they do not save it from being dull beyond belief. I mean, good grief, it is atrociously boring! You get the feeling that someone is going to 'snap', but when it does happen it is the anti-climax of all anti-climaxes."
" Steve Carell does a great job of being eerie in this film.
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,6,Steve Carell does a great job of being eerie in this film.
" A great movie ruined by wrong fact
",2019-12-08 00:00:00,1,"Is this movie bad? Not really. The pace is good. It build the suspense that I anticipated. The acting is as expected from these cast. There's enough wrestling by main characters that shows they know what they're doing. It successfully shows the thirst of approval by John du Pont from his mother.Then, why such a low score? Promoting misconception and there's a lot. There's several that I can overlook like they don't show the timeline correctly, they don't show truthfully the hallucination experienced by John, they wrongfully shows how John was captured.But what I can't stand is they have the guts to portrays Mark as having a gay relationship with John and he suffered from Mark's departure as in a couple after a breakup. Real Mark is literally against this that he brought this to the director's attention on Twitter.So my advice to you, if you wanna watch this, don't google the fact after watching this movie. Just watch it as it is. Overall, 7/10 for the movie and 1/10 for misconception."
" Watch the documentary...
",2019-12-04 00:00:00,5,"... because it's simply immensely superior to this ""based on a true story"" hollow movie. The story of Dupont and his Foxcatcher project is so interesting, I'm baffled by the scriptwriting choices and the lazy directing. Actors have no dialogue to work and characters are unidimensional and dull compared to the real thing. A real missed opportunity."
" Material perhaps better suited to a documentary
",2019-10-30 00:00:00,3,"There are some real-life stories that just cannot be made into interesting movies. This is one of them.Labelled as a ""character study"", it focuses on Mark and Dave Schultz, two wrestlers, Olympic gold-medal winners and their ""mentor"", billionaire John Du Pont.The problem is that the first half of the movie is dominated by Mark and John, two very dry, silent men, with assorted personality disorders. Watching these two moving in chilling, beautiful settings, hardly speaking to each other is not my idea of entertainment.The other two main characters of the movie are John's disapproving mother and Dave, the only outgoing, warm personality.In very sketchy psychological analysis, we should understand that John Du Pont had serious issues with mommy and became a weird, lonely recluse because of that. We should also understand that Mark had issues with big brother Dave (and probably with the whole world at large) and that is why his character is a sullen moron.The soundtrack also takes itself very seriously, so you get the impression of watching a very long wake - and have the same fun.I give one point each to the male leads, who definitely did a great job, but that's as far as it gets. Steve Carell prosthetic nose would be a minus point, but I won't be so stern."
" Foxcatcher
",2019-10-28 00:00:00,8,"FoxcatcherGood film, not a ten but not bad, tells a story based on real facts and the truth is that overall was very good.The performances were impressive but above all I want to emphasize the performance of Steve Carrell, that kills it, to be an actor who makes comedy and now being in a film about drama and crime is very good. Mark and Channing.In my opinion it's a good movie but it's more like a chill crime movie. Sometimes I was uncomfortable watching Steve Carrell because he was always on time but he was scary.Good film recommended"
" Boring

" This Could Be Better
",2019-08-11 00:00:00,5,"I could write an essay. The movie could have run for five hours. Narcissistic Personality Disorder can take a lifetime to understand., let alone a movie. Inadequate. But how do you understand those who are understandable? I choose love but how do you defend yourself against those who choose themselves above everything and everyone else? Is this evil or just an aberration?"
" True, murky story. Carrell's transformation is perfect.
",2019-08-07 00:00:00,8,"Foxcatcher delves into the true story of the murky John du Pont, the endlessly wealthy yet under-achieving son of America's infamous du Pont dynasty, and whose obsession with the sport of wrestling sees him buy his own team with hopes of training them to Olympic glory.
Channing Tatum plays Mark Schultz, an upcoming star keen to step out of his brother-come-coach David's (Mark Ruffalo) shadow and moves onto the du Pont estate as his prized trophy sportsman.
But when Tatum fails to live up to du Pont's expectations, the unnerving millionaire brings his brother on board to whip the team into shape, but as David begins to take over the team and question the change in his younger brother, du Pont marks him as a disposable barrier to his reputation.
Steve Carrell's transformation into du Pont extends beyond his sizeable prosthetic nose, with his dead eyes patrolling his staff and darkly irking those he desperately tries to impress and influence while Ruffalo, with his patient manner and humility, was the perfect choice to honour the memory of David Schultz.
The real Mark Schultz's recent furore in the press was unneeded, with the film offering no real suggestion that his relationship with his wealthy benefactor was sexual in any way.
In actuality, Foxcatcher comes down hard on Du Pont's distant mother, suggesting her life-long disproval of her son is to blame for his emotionless ambition and, ultimately devastating, disregard for human feeling."
" ""We caught the fox, didn't we?""
",2019-07-25 00:00:00,7,"To claim that John du Pont was a bit weird would be quite the understatement. He was more like bizarre, and consequently, Steve Carell's portrayal of the chemical company heir is not just good, it's scary good. There were just enough hints in the story to suggest how du Pont's upbringing derailed his emotional development, to the point where he wound up detached and almost dysfunctional regarding human relationships. There's also a hint of homosexuality in his make-up, though the story doesn't really quite go there in terms of his conduct with champion wrestler Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), even if the feeling is palpable.What's sad to witness is the downward spiral of Mark Schultz, losing much of his desire and incentive to excel once he's caught up in the materialistic world of du Pont. Quite honestly, the business with cocaine came out of left field for this viewer, considering how fundamentally athletic and conscientious both he and du Pont were with regard to the training regimen at the Valley Forge training facility. It was Mark's good fortune that brother Dave (Mark Ruffalo) maintained his love and loyalty for Mark, even after some bitter moments. Even though John du Pont had an inability to effectively communicate with the brothers, he was still there as a wedge between the two regarding their future plans and aspirations.What kind of surprises me is that I had never heard this story about John du Pont and the Schultz Brothers before seeing this film. I'm fairly up to speed on current events when they occur and even though the time frame here was the late Eighties, it seemed to fly under my radar back in the day. Unlike most sports stories where final victory is celebrated as an achievement by an athlete or team against incredible odds, this one is more likely to leave one feeling dispirited and unnerved with no happy ending. Watch this one for the performances of the principal players who inhabit their characters with a compassion and pathos that goes against the grain of a typical movie experience."
" Interesting character study SPOLIERS
",2019-07-22 00:00:00,10,"This is a deliberately paced movie that examines the relationship between 1984 Olympic medalist Mark Shultz and John Du Pont, of the Du Pont family. I have not read the book on which the movie is based and was only aware of the basic facts of what transpired back in 1988. I think some reviewers who rated this under a 5 thought it was going to be a feel good sports movie or action pic (I guess because Channing Tatum is in it). It's really a character study of two deeply flawed men, one of whom is so unable to grasp reality he commits murder. I thought the acting was very good by all, with Steve Carrell almost unrecognizable as Du Pont, and Tatum and the wonderful Ruffalo very sympathetic. (I have to admit Carrell does seem somnulent at times, and the pacing could have been tightened in early scenes). The biggest weakness of the movie is that it really doesn't reveal the extent of Du Pont's psychosis before the murder occurs. Although it's clear that he is grieving the loss of his relationship with Mark--and Du Pont was definitely not ""all there"" to begin with--there was a missed opportunity to build up suspense after Mark left. A previous reviewer questioned why Mark Shultz had become upset with Du Pont--do people watch the movie before writing their reviews?? Du Pont had been encouraging and flattering, crafting a sense of intimacy that Mark lacked in his life, then started directing the venom he had for his mom toward Mark. When he told Mark off and slapped his face in front of the team, he tore down Mark's authority. Du Pont then insisted Mark's brother Dave come to coach, when Du Pont had previously given Mark a pep talk about not needing to feel inferior to his brother. Plus he'd introduced Mark to cocaine, and as Mark's athetic performance started to suffer he spiralled down into deep depression and had a mental breakdown. So no hard feelings there (!). Anyway, it seemed like brother Dave was doing a decent job smoothing things over, then...well, I would highly recommend viewing the documentary Fox Catcher for more insight into Du Pont."
" Steve Carell
",2019-06-27 00:00:00,7,"Fair movie, not amazing.
The story (based on real events) is somewhat dull, not extremely interesting. One of the most interesting scenes is not in the movie (spoiler alert): when they negotiate with John about giving up!
Steve Carell is amazing (as always), in a dramatic role this time!
I watched the movie only because of Steve."
" Well made drama.
",2019-05-28 00:00:00,7,"A film crafted in an extremely artful and detail-oriented approach. Great Carrell and Ruffalo performances, but Tatum's performance is a bit bland. Tatum's character arc seems very rushed; the writing seems to leave out key details that lead to the change in character motives. However, despite these flaws the film delivers on the shock value of these true events. Definitely worth the watch."
" Foxcatcher
",2019-04-21 00:00:00,7,"A quietly powerful movie about a very sad bit of American sports history. Steve Carell, Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum offers mesmerizing performances that makes Foxcatcher a pleasurable watch. At the end of the day, the film revolves around the character John Du Post, however interesting and troubling of a character he is, the overall film rides too much on his erratic personality and behaviour that it fails to reveal either more of this past or the inner workings of the Schultz Brothers. The way the film explores the idea of mental fragility feels honest and believable. Carell projects himself onto Mark, a malleable young men in need of direction, but once he sees failure, John immediately discards him for immediate gratification in Dave."
" Great turns in a slow clunker
",2019-03-21 00:00:00,6,"A slow, brooding tale of a real life tragedy, it doesn't seem to have the best script as the dialogue is sparse and forgettable.The photography is good although unnecessarily drab, but the pacing is infuriatingly slow, as a better editor could have cut about half an hour without losing much in terms or story or character development.In the end you do feel really strongly about the characters, however this is solely due to the marvelous performances of the 3 key players and the tragic story the script is dealing with.Liked: the story

" Steve Carell, Channing Tatum, and Mark Ruffalo at the peak of their careers
",2019-03-18 00:00:00,10,"When you see Steve Carell in a movie, you expect him to be the funniest thing in a movie. When you see Channing Tatum, you expect him to be buff, and be the hot hero of the movie. When you see Mark Ruffalo, you expect to see comedy-drama movies, and he's just a side character. With Foxcatcher, you see none of those. Instead, you see a very ominous picture. The musical score is scarcely used, which makes it even better. The best part of the picture, no doubt, is Steve Carell as John E. DuPont. Holy Hell! He was frightening just to look at. And him talking without yelling is actually what sells it. Channing Tatum was absolutely phenomenal as Mark Schultz. Not only did he nail the role perfectly, he took it to the next level, and actually managed to even stay in character even when he injured himself with the mirror. Mark Ruffalo was rather quiet as Dave Schultz, but even then, it's necessary for the character development. Bennett Miller's Foxcatcher is an underrated gem that people overlooked. With a sports movie, you get to know the players of the team, you have them lose first, but along the way they win the games, and eventually come closer as a team and family. With Foxcatcher, none of that happens. Instead, you get a chronological series of events, and Steve Carell being rather reclusive toward his team, and his mother, played by Vanessa Redgrave. It doesn't have you watching, and enjoying it. It has you watching a reality with actors, who are usually cast in stereotypical roles, breaking that streak, and having the people they're playing come out instead of them. This movie easily made it to my top 20 list."
" Movies Self Promotional Buzz Tricked The Sheeple Into Believing That This Embarrassingly Bad Movie Is Good
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,1,"This movie actually succeeds in being weirder than John DuPont. This movie commits to nothing, including substance. Why was this movie even made?... I understand why a movie was made depicting the circumstances associated with the Schultz brothers and Dupont, but why was this movie made? Sure, sometimes movies/writers/directors have a story/direction in mind, but in the end it doesn't come into fruition for whatever reason. In this instance, it's like, what the f__k were they thinking? They were alright with this? I would imagine that the actual events associated with Foxcatcher should make for an interesting story and I'd really like to see that movie, but it sure isn't this B-rate movie, and yes it acts and feels very much like a B-rate movie.The fact that some people rated this movie well is an interesting psychological phenomenon. I don't believe anyone liked this movie... people were tricked into liking this horrendous movie because they heard some caned hype in the movie promos. Many people don't understand that the buzz is not actual buzz from the movie, rather it's the buzz from the people selling the movie... then in sheep like fashion they echo the buzz of a successful movie promo campaign and that's exactly what happened in reference to any positive reviews this movie received. I can't help but think of the Steve Carell's performance was excellent buzz, when in fact it was hilariously bad (btw Carell's normally a great actor). He looked and sounded nothing like the guy for one, but would not have been a problem if he created his own character that was acted and performed well. I don't blame Carroll because when every single character in the movie comes across like a Saturday Night live skit, the mistake is not with the actors, but the director/story, etc.This movie doesn't give us much substance... to avoid spoilers I won't break down specifics, but it does a poor job of telling the story and ultimately leaves the viewer with more questions than answers. If the viewer does end up caring, it's not because this movie makes them care, it's just because they're curious about what the actual story may have been. I'd be very surprised if Mark Schultz was happy with this movie. At the very least he must have been pissed about what it implied, especially if it didn't happen. Maybe he can rest assure knowing that he isn't alone... every person who has watched this movie has also taken it in the shorts."
" Interesting but UNINSPIRING sports drama.
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,6,"Surprisingly the performances of tatum and CARELL👏 are impressive and mark ruffalo always delivers in a serious role, based on true life events about a troubled rich eccentric who souly took charge of the american olympic wrestling team in the late 80s, the movie hits the mark in regards to the story its telling and the characters and events are apparently accurate but it feels like an overblown tv movie with a tragic story that fails to inspire. 6/10"
" Made my list of ""worst movies ever""
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,1,Boring and dull. I was mad when I left the cinema. Had hoped the movie would get better at some point. It didn't.
" The bleak side of the Olympic dream
",2019-02-16 00:00:00,7,"The film is based on the true story of brothers Mark and Dave Schultz (played by Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo), American wrestlers who won gold medals in the 1984 Olympics. The film begins after their wins as they are pursued to to live and train in a sports community owned by eccentric mega-millionaire John du Pont (Steve Carell).It is easy to distinguish this as an independent film as opposed to a typical Hollywood film. A Hollywood film would likely have ended with the Olympic glory with the final victory in slow motion (including the audience jumping to its feet) with a blaring orchestra. Instead, ""Foxcathcher"" shows a very deglamourized life (especially Mark's) post-Olympics, bravely showing the flip-side of the Olympic dream.Director Bennett Miller uses a story-telling style that is deliberately bleak and emotionally distant. This mood is best shown in Carell's performance which is subtle and repressed as he portrays someone who, most of his life, was given too much money and not enough love. The only warmth in the film comes from Ruffalo whose character has found happiness with his young family.The bleak style is fine but up to a point as the movie feels too long a 2.25 hours. Also, despite the length, there still seems to too little background of some characters. It's still praiseworthy, though, for its unique approach to sports biographies."

" The film seems to focus on the most uninteresting parts of the story
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,5,"Foxcatcher is based on a tragic and fascinating true story, but the film seems to focus on the most uninteresting parts of the story. I found the actual news articles to be more engaging than this movie. Nevertheless, Foxcatcher is almost worth watching for the subtle, yet dramatic physical changes to Steve Carell's and Channing Tatum's appearance, as well as their performances. Those two do a really good job."
" Awesome!
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,10,"Loved this movie. Carell, Ruffalo, and Tatum did an amazing performance!"
" a biopic about a man who changed wrestling
",2018-11-18 00:00:00,10,Review: I loved this movie because of it gives us a look into the world of wrestlers when an obsessed fan gets involved. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Too long
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,5,"Foxcatcher is not a great film. For a start its just too long long. There is far too much time spent building up to the frustratingly brief climax. Altough the end is surprising, I had never really got attached tonany character so it was almost as if I didnt mind what happened. Steve Carell is intetesting to watch in a noncomedy role, but his acting is nothing special. All in all its a very boring film, with at the very least an interesting ending and overall informative story. 6/10"
" If you like feeling uncomfortable during a movie...
",2018-08-15 00:00:00,1,"If you enjoy a slow, unbearably slow, movie...
If you enjoy a nearly wordless movie...
If you enjoy weird, cringe-worthy characters and dialogues in movies...
Watch this movie.If, however, you see ""sports drama"" and think ""ohhhh this is going to be one of those gut-wrenching, tear-inducing, nail-biting, ""Go! Go! Go!""-screaming-at-the-TV!!! movies"", do yourself a favor and go see ""The Blind Side"", ""We are Marshall"", ""Coach Carter"". This movie should be ashamed of itself to belong to the same category as these great films and others like them."
" Disappointing
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,3,"Paid £2.50 for this movie, thinking it would have way more action. Very slow beginning, I know they can't fit everything that happened into one movie, but it contained no detail of Johns mental state/deterioration which is the interesting part about this story."
" Entertaining
",2018-04-30 00:00:00,9,Not your typical sports-themed movie. Unfolds slowly but entertains. Great acting from all three leads. Didn't recognise Steve Carell under his makeup. And the wonderful Vanessa Redgrave makes an appearance. Being based on true events adds another dimension.
" Foxcatcher is described as an ""electrifying thriller"", but let's not get ahead of ourselves.
",2018-03-09 00:00:00,7,"Based on the true events of John du Pont forming a wrestling team with the Schultz brothers for the 1988 Olympic Games. It's a story of both power and control, as the struggle for constant authority creates tension and paranoia within the team. This eventuality leads to an unforeseen tragic event. Foxcatcher is what I would class as an interesting character study, on both Mark Schultz and John du Pont. The constant desire for victory and the goals for patriotism. Du Pont having unlimited money, can do pretty much whatever he wishes. That in itself is control, but yet seemingly he consistently loses that authoritative presence to Dave Schultz. Was really interesting to watch. Transformative performances for both Channing Tatum and Steve Carell really aided is portraying their characters realistically. Both of them were outstanding and deserved every recognition they got. Their physical prowess was extraordinary. Mark Ruffalo was consistent yet again, however Vanessa Redgrave was criminally underused. The wrestling scenes that they actually contributed in were well filmed and exciting to watch. It's not a sport I'm familiar with, but I've taken down some notes...y'know, in case I need to decimate a thug or something. Bennett Miller's direction was very precise, he took his time with the plot and the long static camera shots evidently showed that. This leads me to the massive negative of the film: pacing. This was slow. Far too slow. 134 minutes of character development that leads to a 1 minute event at the end. Although, that final event was executed to perfection and full of tension. However, I can see why people dislike the pace. Intriguingly, the execution of the dialogue was at a snail's pace as well! Waiting for Carell to say a sentence takes about 2 minutes. Sure it's captivating if you truly focus, but for those who actually don't have any interest in this will surely fall asleep. An ""electrifying thriller"" it is not, but a very well executed character study it is."
" Vague retelling with brilliant preformances
",2018-02-07 00:00:00,7,"This was a little (lot) vague at times, whereas at the end I had to Google the events that happened to get the whys of it. Based on a true story about millionaire John Du Pont and his relationship with two brothers, Dave & Mark Schultz, Olympic wrestlers he engages to train at his estate so that he can be an ""Olympic coach."" Mark initially idolizes Du Pont but slowly realizes the depths of his benefactors madness.Things are hinted at...sexual misconduct and the actual murder is done in such a vague way it doesn't appear to have any motivation. Its slow at times and sorta feels like a documentary in its style which keeps the viewer at a distance. The make up and acting from all involved is phenomenal though. Steve Carell, wow creepy brilliant job. Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo as the brothers also do a great job."
" This is a bizarre but real story of men with cauliflower ears ;-)
",2018-02-03 00:00:00,8,"Anybody who is not aware of the star cast may make a failed guess about the actor who played John du Pont. It is one of a performance by Steve Carell. Steve have nailed it in so many ways. The makeup was superb. The bizzare dialogue delivery was well acted. Not only Steve's, but Channing and Mark's characters were given thoughtful makeup, for example the Cauliflower Ears common in wrestlers. The expecting though unexpected climax stole the other interesting parts of the story. I am impressed by the director, Bennett Miller. It is one of his best work till date - even better than Moneyball."
" Great performances, great tension
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,8,"The absolute epitome of ""show don't tell."" This film builds its tension and develops its characters with actions...not words. Plus, the performances - from Carrell to Ruffalo - are fantastic. Granted the plot is uneven and slow, but the overall effect is chilling nonetheless."
" Even if you're not into wrestling it's worth watching
",2017-12-18 00:00:00,7,"Even if you're not a fan of wrestling this movie is worth watching. I'm myself not a big fan of that sport but the movie is interesting and captivating. It's based on a true story, a story that I as an European had never heard of, and that makes it even more interesting. The make-up artists deserve a lot of credits in Foxcatcher because if it was not for the distinctive voice of Steve Carrell, that I immediately recognized, his physic transformation was stunning. You could hardly recognize him. Channing Tatum's make-up was also good. He looked like he escaped from his cave and he did portray the image that I had of a wrestler very well. The story is easy to follow and the outcome was not what I thought it would be, that was a bonus. The character of John Du Pont played by Steve Carrell is the typical rich guy that thinks everything is for sale and the guy that thinks he can get away with anything. He's a repulsive guy to watch but very well done from Steve Carrell. So even if you're not interested in wrestling give this movie a chance, you might like it like I did."
" Never heard of this story and that was a bonus
",2017-12-05 00:00:00,7,"Foxcatcher is a long movie but it never gets boring and that's something. As a Belgian I never heard of this story so for me it was all a surprise. I like movies based on a true story, certainly one like this one. The make-up crew should also get credits because what they did to Steve Carrell and Channing Tatum was very well done. It's because Steve Carrell as a specific voice that I recognized him immediately but with his changed physics I could have been fooled. He plays a really annoying character, one of those rich guys that thinks you can buy anybody or anything. But he did a very good job playing that arrogant prick. Channing Tatum looks like he came out straight of a cavern. He also did a good job, like all the rest of the cast. The story is interesting to watch and the end was surprising to me. I'm not a big fan of the wrestling sport but for this story it doesn't matter if you like it or not. Certainly worth a watch."
" Emotionally cold sports-drama but with an amazing performance from Steve Carrell
",2017-10-16 00:00:00,6,"There have been a few critically praised professional fighter movies in recent years such as The Wrestler (2008), The Fighter (2010) and Warrior (2011). Foxcatcher is another in this line of serious-minded sports-dramas, except this may be the most downbeat of them all. Unlike the others, this one is also a docudrama biopic based on real characters and events which surrounded Team Foxcatcher, which was the brainchild of billionaire John du Pont who used his money to gather the American wrestling team to live and train on his estate in preparation for the 1988 Seoul Olympics. The two most prominent members of this team were the Olympic gold-medal winning brothers Dave and Mark Schultz. The story is primarily told from the latter's perspective, as he enters the weird world of du Pont.I wasn't in the least bit aware of anything to do with this true story when I watched this. It is certainly a very odd set of events that is for sure and one which does justify a movie. It does have to be said though that this is one of those films which adopts a very emotionally distant tone, which means that it is hard getting as involved with the characters as maybe we really should be. It's so overwhelmingly bleak and humourless that it is difficult to fully enjoy to be perfectly honest. But it is still an interesting story overall though, which results in a murder that I frankly did not predict in the least. The du Pont character is certainly a bizarre one. He lives with his mother in a huge mansion but seems to suffer from some social condition which makes him extremely odd in one-to-one conversations and interactions. Despite his highly sheltered life he improbably has a cocaine habit, as well as an unusual obsession with professional wrestling. It has to be said that Steve Carell is quite brilliant as this awkward character, in a performance which is the chief selling point of the movie overall. He completely immerses himself in the role and the result is what you could describe as truly proper acting. Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo are also very good as the two Shultz brothers but this is really Carrell's movie overall, given how outstanding he was. The film as a whole is an impressive enough one which tells an interesting story but its thoroughly downbeat execution means it's one which keeps its distance from you and, as such, it's a movie which is easier to admire than to love."
" Utterly boring
",2017-10-08 00:00:00,3,"This movie is not only boring, it also looks boring: Gray palette that gives it this flat and dull look. The pace is also very slow and it feels like the actors are bored and just want to get the movie over with. The music also wants to put you to sleep it seems. Or the lack of it.The movie is also based on a true story, yet the actors who portrays the real characters, are doing a very poor job. As an example; The actor who plays Dave, resembles nothing how he was in real life: Funny, full of energy, witty, always cheerful. The only similarity they have, is that he has a beard and is balding. The Same goes for the actor who plays John Du Pont; John Du Pont were never this slow or psycho as he is portrayed in the movie. And no way he had THAT big nose!If you want to see something interesting and exciting, watch the documentary! This movie is just boring and a waste of time. And you learn nothing from it."
" Outfoxed
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,7,"Invited to train for the Seoul Olympics at a facility run by an eccentric millionaire, a young wrestler struggles to maintain his sanity in this downbeat but engrossing drama based on a true story. The project is carefully directed by Bennett Miller who deliberately paces the material with many elongated silent shots of the protagonist just sitting around and contemplating. This might not sound particularly interesting, but with Channing Tatum in solid form as the wrestler in question, all these non-action based moments give us a great glimpse into his mind. Steve Carell is also excellent in a supporting turn (the BAFTAs got the category correct) as the mysterious millionaire with an unspoken hidden agenda. On one hand, it is a little underwhelming how the dynamics of Carell and Tatum's friendship are only ever implied with only some suggestion of Carell liking Tatum as more than just a friend; on the other hand, there is a lot to admire in how Miller leaves it up to our imagination regarding the highs, lows and rifts between the pair. Mark Ruffalo is also terrific as Tatum's brother, though he is far less subdued. Providing far more questions than answers regarding what occurred between the real life Mark Schultz and John Du Pont, 'Foxcatcher' does not necessarily offer the most satisfying narrative out there, but there is much to like in how moody and unsettling an experience it is."
" Steve Carell, Steals the Spotlight, But Ruffalo Assists.
",2017-09-01 00:00:00,7,"From the moment Steve Carell made his first on screen appearance, you could already sense something off about his character, but because you can't imagine what it could be and whether your feelings are accurate or not, it's very easy to dismiss; however, still, you remain uneasy, and that, is just brilliant.Though I truly haven't the slightest idea as to who Dave Schultz is, Mark Ruffalo's portrayal and performance was just majestic. The mannerisms and idiosyncrasies were testament to Ruffalo's ability to harness his craft with ease and precision.Channing Tatum however, is not nearly as good as his costars, and though I don't really have a problem with him in this particular film, Channing is an awful to mediocre and forgettable actor at best, and even at his best - which I believe was the case in Foxcatcher - he isn't enough... He isn't capable. What helped him tremendously in this film, were the ranges and quality of his fellow stars.I believe Foxcatcher would've definitely benefited from the exclusion of Tatum. Ryan Gosling, James Franco, Chris Pratt, Jake Gyllenhaal... Maybe even Liam Hemsworth, any of these guys, would've assisted in bringing Foxcatcher home, and complimented everything else that was just so right with this film.Foxcatcher is a story I didn't see coming. It has a slow start, that becomes confusing, but in a good way, because it depicts senselessness in a way that creates more questions for the viewer as to why; and the answer, is surly and truly worth the wait.I'd love to give Foxcatcher a solid 8/10, but it had an element that, even with his greatest attempt, always only seems to sap away rather than contribute to, and sadly, though he was seemingly much better this time around, Channing Tatum still couldn't shy away from his natural setting; and because of that, Tatum is to Carell and Ruffalo, what du Pont was to Dave and Mark. 7.4/10."
" The Fox and the Hound.
",2017-08-10 00:00:00,7,"Finding his run in the remake of The Office to be hilarious,I've been meaning to see Steve Carell's Oscar nominated role,but have somehow always missed the chance. Finding out it was to be shown on the BBC, I got set to finally catch the fox.The plot:Whilst they have both won Olympic gold, Olympic wrestling champion Mark Schultz still feels he is being overshadowed by his brother Dave. Training one day, Mark gets an invite to meet multi millionaire John E. du Pont. Previously having success at Olympic wrestling, Pont invites Mark to be the star player for the new team he is starting up: Team Foxcatcher. Accepting the offer, Mark at first finds Pont to be a father figure he has always wanted, but overtime,they both find their relationship to get trapped in a foxhole. View on the film:Keeping any punchlines in the foxhole, Steve Carell gives a reptile- like performance as du Pont, whose stoic manner and fading vocal delivery cast a shadow of a man worn down to the bone. Smashing his head into a mirror as an improve, Channing Tatum gives a very good performance as Mark,whose passion for the sport Tatum turns from energetic to tired, whilst Mark Ruffalo gives the bio-pic some real folk charm as David.For the third in his ""Based on true life"" trilogy, director Bennett Miller & cinematographer Greig Fraser wrestle with a raw, unsettling calm atmosphere,as lingering shots on the conversations between Pont and Mark grab the sour turn the almost father/son relationship takes. Backed by a very good sombre Industrial hum from Rob Simonsen, the screenplay by E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman successfully grapple with the decade spanning time-line, by wonderfully building the gradual breakdown of the relationship between the Schultz and the increasingly reclusive du Pont, as the foxcatchers get outfoxed."
" Unsettling silence
",2017-08-08 00:00:00,7,There's a sense of foreboding that runs through the entirety of the film which leaves you unsettled by the end. A superb performance from Steve Carrell who in addition to being nearly unrecognizable has a very creepy screen presence throughout. Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo are good as well but didn't really exceed other dramas I've seen them in.The wrestling scenes looked great and you could tell they trained hard to get them looking right. This seems like a small detail but when it's done well it really adds to the immersion.There's not a lot to the story but the way its shot and the dark tone it invokes really raises it up from being a simple character study. It feels more about family and that fear being a failure in their eyes.
" Buying approval
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,7,"Foxcatcher is a brooding slow burn film from director Bennett Miller about two men looking for approval. One from his more gregarious older brother, the other from his disapproving horse fixated mother.Channing Tatum plays Mark Schultz, an Olympic gold medal winner in the 1984 Olympics somewhat living in the shadow of his older brother David (Mark Ruffalo) also an Olympic gold medal winner.In the opening scene we see Mark talking uncomfortably to a class of children at school. This is good for Mark as it allows him to get out of his brother's shadow. Yet when we see Mark wrestle he is always more effective when David gives him a pep talk.After a disagreement between Mark and du Pont, David is persuaded to join the training team. You can see his more effective training methods at play but at the same time it has a negative effect on Mark who already descended to a spiral of booze and cocaine under du Pont's influence and he becomes embittered performing poorly in the Seoul Olympics.The film is based on true life and tragic events with du Pont's influence suffocating those around him. He wants approval, he wants to be a mentor when all the time you think when you see him wrestle with the young men that he just wants to cop a feel of them.This is an actor's film. Carell looks unrecognizable under heavy make up with Tatum also putting more of a performance where less is more. The film is absorbing and despite the slow pace, yet at times it can also be lifeless."
" 10/10 from me
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,10,"Wow - this movie was an unexpected discovery! It's a real gem, with superb performances and an intelligent script and what makes it all the more remarkable is that it's a true story! I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who is looking for something with some depth and who enjoy deep, layered performances."
