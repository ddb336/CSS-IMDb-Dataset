" Hilarious!
",2021-03-31 00:00:00,7,Was a long time since I had a good laugh while watching a movie. Pleasantly surprised for me is a full 7 stars :D.
" Sure it's not a great movie, but it's entertaining enough
",2021-03-05 00:00:00,5,"The only reason I really watched this film is because of Elizabeth Banks. She's a great actress and nails comedy roles, so I thought I'd give it a shot. While the movie as a whole was never great, Banks carried it and injected her magnetic screen presence throughout. She was easily the highlight of the whole film and was very watchable.Walk of Shame had a decent plot, and exploited a lot of comedic potential in the scenarios that it created. It was entertaining to watch and I did find myself caring about Banks' character. However it just never quite got me laughing out loud. It was always close to being properly funny, but never quite got there. Still a perfectly enjoyable plot though.I think maybe one of the things letting this film down was the supporting characters. They were below par and the script just wasn't there for these characters. Perhaps if more thought had gone into some of the sub plots and side characters the film as a whole could have been better.Still, I enjoyed watching this film. It's far from a great comedy, but is a decent watch and I had fun with it."
" Walk of Meh
",2021-02-26 00:00:00,5,"Banks is a news person that goes out and has to walk across the city on her own and wow is that a challenge! Marsden is always a delight to me and I keep thinking he's one of the most underutilized people in Hollywood. Jacobs is always a fun surprise for me, after her turn in Community I'd watch her in anything. This whole thing is just so generic, minimal effort nonsense. It keeps hammering away at the same jokes that weren't funny the first time but sure are the low hanging fruit.Basically, you've probably never heard of this before and there's a reason for it. It's practically designed to live out it's shelf life in the forgotten realms of daytime cable tv. It's not worth your time or attention. It's just a movie with minimal substance so go ahead and skip it for anything better."
" Clearly a man wrote this and the actresses are the only good thing about this film
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,4,"I rarely write a review but it infuriates me that a woman's struggle to get home is turned into a comedy. She called a hooker just because of how she's dressed, no one will believe she's not, and it's clear to me that a man 100% wrote this script. All of these scenarios she finds herself in, are genuinely horrifying, if you're a woman. The fear, the inability to trust anyone, the threat of rape or death; a man knows none of this and writes this movie as a comedy. It's not. It's triggering. The only redeeming quality is the acting of these women. I honestly wish it could be funny but it's not."
" Uneven, but pretty good
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,7,"Elizabeth Banks does comedy well. Dialogue, reaction shots and physical comedy are all in her wheelhouse. Good thing she's up for it because landed on her shoulders and she carried it off. The story line is right out of the keystone cops. Updated for modern times, our Perils of Pauline heroine needn't be rescued. In fact, no one will even offer to help for most of the film. That's when Banks shines. Interactions with all manner of people on the fringes of society show her to be as vulnerable as they are...and it's all for laughs. Her scenes in the crack house (yes, you read the correctly) are particularly hilarious. Look for her face to face with Tig Natro too. Another bit of comedy happiness. Truth be told, some vignettes go nowhere. The cops in the squad car bits could have been eliminated for instance. But, overall this is a fun time in the hands of a skilled actress who can certainly pass for a comedian until someone better comes along."
" ALMOST HANG OVER!
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,8,"To my surprise, this movie turned out to be one of the best comedies I have seen over a couple of years. It had been a long time I laughed like that watching a movie. Unexpectedly, I never thought it would be. Meghan Miles was amazing. The best character in the movie, no doubt, with his magnificent hilarious accent, the pookie guy. He was the base of the comedy. The Crack house, the pot, everything was hilarious. A laugh riot. It is highly underrated. I need more like this."
" Banks breaks out
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,8,"Elizabeth Banks carried this title, which deserves a special place among female-led comedies. Solid script with some excellent supporting characters, this movie is a warm and upbeat take on the life of a career woman. It is paced well, largely quite original, holds up well with time (I watched it in 2021 and when released in 2014)."
" AFTER HOURS in La-La-Land ; Banks shines her comedic chops in a tailor-made role
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,8,"WALK OF SHAME (2014) *** Elizabeth Banks, James Marsden, Gillian Jacobs, Sarah Wright, Ethan Suplee, Bill Burr. Banks shines her comic chops in this tailor-made (pun intended - you'll see) as a up-and-coming LA tv anchor whose one shot at the top is marred by a daylong excursion to get to her station for an interview at a promotion after a girls-night-out heads her down a rabbit-hole of unexpected pitfalls (i.e. no money, transportation and only a formfitting yellow dress). Basically a remake of AFTER HOURS in La-La-Land. (Dir: Steven Brill)"
" Hilarious Fun
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,9,We absolutely loved this movie. Elisabeth Banks was both beautiful and hilarious in this story about misunderstandings piled on top of mishaps. All the characters were engaging and did their parts to make this a well done comedy.
" Funny funny funny
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,10,"I don't understand the negative reviews. I am a 65-year-old feminist bi woman and found this to be quite funny. A day gone very bad. Far-fetched, but not so out of bounds, since how many folks really do step up and help anyone? In today's world folks tend to make snap decisions and walk away. Sad to say. This movie addressed this and one woman's issues stemming from it.
Elizabeth Banks was great as was all the cast. I think the writer brought things full circle and while some have cited this picture saccharine and insulting to women, I fully disagree. I guess they have never had a day where EVERYTHING GOES SIDEWAYS. Well, good for You, folks, but cut the rest of the world a break. This is life & sometimes it is just the sticky end of the stick.
My husband and I enjoyed this and will watch it again. If you like farce, then relax back and enjoy. Filming was spot on, dialogue so TODAY.
GREAT JOB CAST & CREW. LOVED IT!"
" Sooo not funny
",2020-09-14 00:00:00,1,Stupid and not funny at all. Dumb stereotypes. YUK
" Stupidy comedy
",2020-09-01 00:00:00,5,"I mean i like that type of comedy but i know that is not something that we all enjoy, but if you like that i will recommend you this movie."
" Killer humour
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,9,"Description : A late night of partying turns into horror for Meghan when she wakes up next to a stranger and is about to miss out on the job interview of a lifetime.Review : I so wish no one ever sees such a day, but definitely watch Meghan's day. The movie is hilarious throughout. Plot, acting , direction and comic timing is terrific. If you enjoy humor and life as a pair, this is a definite watch."
" No Honey, No Help
",2020-07-15 00:00:00,6,"Decent watch, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend.It's not that it's a bad movie: I'm not a big Elizabeth Banks fan, and you get a lot of her, like 90% of the movie is just her being abused by the world, with very little triumph along the way. The rest of the movie is basically everyone else in the world forcing, manipulating, and validating her, and it would have been a better experience if she was a stronger character.I get (and it's very obvious, very early) that the point is that she's a weak character that is forced to grow through the adversity of this adventure. I just would have rather seen someone stronger (think American Lara Croft for a moment) run a similar formula of problem, attempt resolution, extraordinary circumstance, new problem, etc. Hell make it a parkour movie where a free runner had a blackout night, basically ""The Hangover"" meets ""Mirror's Edge"" (video game).My point is, that when you see something and want something else, you don't like what you have in front of you, even if it's a decent (but different) movie that you were expecting. It an awful part of being human.While the humor is decent, the repetitive formula creates fulfilled expectation, which dulls the comedy. It's also not very uplifting.I think it's fair to say that Elizabeth Banks is statistically attractive, in a cute dress, and is playing a character who is a local celebrity. I've also been informed being a white woman is advantageous. She's basically an ideal candidate to get charity help, except from people that are just as likely to kill her, but it pushes my suspension of disbelief that she isn't able to get people to talk to her, let alone actually help her.I'm just realizing that, having been stranded before, on multiple occasions, I may be being a little harsh, but it just doesn't make it as enjoyable for me."
" Funny as hell
",2020-07-15 00:00:00,10,Don't expect a Sundance festival masterpiece but if you want an easy going funny movie this is great. I honestly laughed a lot watching this
" NOT recommended.
",2020-04-08 00:00:00,3,"I wanted a light watch and kept hoping it's gonna get better and less lame? Sadly it didn't. So I skipped to the ending and well it was okayish but a bit too corny I guess?
Not a good choice"
" Silly funny movie
",2020-03-06 00:00:00,5,"If you want to watch a good movie, don't watch this one, however, if you are in the mood for something completely silly and amusing this will get some laughs.
As for the misogyny mentioned in many reviews, yes, a lot of the language and characters are sexist, the film is plagued by cliches of female behaviour, but, unfortunately these exist in our everyday real world and I don't see the point in airbrushing fiction and brush everything we don't like under the carpet."
" Far-fetched fun
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,7,"Sure, the premise is super far-fetched, but Banks is amazing in this and there are plenty of laughs. I can see how this wasn't enough for the silver screen but this is a perfect Netflix film, which is right where you will watch it. The critics can suck my balls, I'm sure they will find them too salty."
" Unexpectedly HILARIOUS!
",2019-10-31 00:00:00,9,"I stumbled on this movie
while channel surfing.
I literally laughed out loud several times!
Don't go by any negative
reviews, see it for yourself
you will be pleasantly
surprised. That scene on the city bus is comedy gold!! Ladies,admit it, we have ALL had our, ""walk"""
" Offensive and boring
",2019-03-23 00:00:00,1,I found this film very offensive to women and and didn't laugh once 🙄
" Embrace the good news here!
",2018-10-27 00:00:00,8,"Thank you Elizabeth Banks. You rock. Yes, the world also brings good news. Meghan Miles (played by Elizabeth Banks) gets drunk, gets in bed with a stranger, her car is towed, finds herself in 'the hood', and because she is in a not-so-conservative dress everybody calls her a hooker even though she denies it repeatedly, they put it to her. She is even called a temptress and witch when she strays into a den of rabbis. Pushed down from a bus by a female bus driver and haunted down by the police, life, in same manner, beats her down repeatedly (can life go wronger than this?)...but she rises like a Phoenix from the ashesAnd when she finally returns to work, she chooses to not report the 'fake news' script but instead tells the truth and life finally smiles on her. The world sure brings good news.Thank you Ms. Banks for teaching us to be ourselves. Lest I forget, nothing is wrong with the yellow dress. I love it.Kisses!"
" NO PHONE, NO CAR, NO ID
",2018-10-09 00:00:00,6,"Meghan (Elizabeth Banks) is our Jenny McCarthy Barbie doll who reads the news. She is down on her luck, so her girlfriends dress her up and take her out for a good time. Through a series of circumstances, Meaghan, finds herself in LA in the wrong part of town. Her asking for help is seen as solicitation for prostitution as she constantly ends up at the wrong place at the wrong time.The film had some light moments, but as a comedy it falls flat. There is a lack of originality and delivery. Elizabeth Banks is easy on the eye, but comedy is not her strong suit. The groans far outweigh the laughs. The humor maturity level is aimed at a PG-13 audience, but too many f-bombs make it an ""R."" I think most of us could have composed a funnier ""Walk of Shame."""
" Banks carries the entire picture with aplomb
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,7,"6/22/18. Banks is such a great versatile actress and this movie shows you how she does it. Almost effortlessly, she goes from glamorous TV anchor to a woman mistaken for one of ill-repute. She survives the worst LA neighborhoods after partying and drinking too much the night before. Along the way she meets a variety of urban dwellers and escapes with her virtue intact, although a major fashion mess. It was a fun movie to watch. I liked the scene where she was in a spa."
" Date Night, After Hours, copy but Funny!!!
",2017-05-30 00:00:00,6,"Walk of Shame surfing in the wave of the Date Night, After Hours among the other movies, but have another thing that differentiates from them it's sexy, all kind of situations is about the yellow short dress, besides the plot could be unbelievable, it works as comedy of errors, the main character Meghan (Elizabeth Banks) is surprising fantastic and reasonable in the role carrying the movie along the streets, good movie even as carbon copy of the others famous movies.Resume:First watch: 2017 / How many: 1 / Source: Netflix / Rating: 7"
" Banks pulled this one off big time!
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,9,"Always loved Liz Banks. Not very common to have a picture perfect face with a even better skill to back it up. Ms Banks is clearly one of the few such lead actors. Honestly, the story line has holes you can fly choppers right through them. But hey, it's comedy, right? But without Ms Banks, I don't think this could have worked. She has the thing to pull the viewer in and ride alone with her with sympathy and lighthearted fun. No Oscar stuff here. But this movie is smart, sexy, and fun. Love it!"
