" Truly awesome.
",2021-04-08 00:00:00,10,Storyarc is great.Based on a short story.Full of suspense and excing twists.Depicts love in its true form.
" Different concept
",2021-04-07 00:00:00,7,"Good story, could have been executed better. Acting and visual are very good. Ending may have been better. But must watch for one time. You will not get bored for a single second, movie is to the point."
" star studded cast but lacklustre
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,6,"I suppose the twists and Poe got all the talented actors on board but it was slightly boring for what it should've been. Reminded me quite a lot the recent remake of Murder on the Orient Express. Twists are interesting but everything else is just, okay and even sometimes mediocre."
" Surprisingly good!
",2021-02-15 00:00:00,8,Surprisingly good! It reminds me of the second season of American Horror Story ... I love movies with endings like this! Recommendation to watch!
" American ( B+ Movie) My Ratings 8/10
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,8,"TRUE REALITY OF MODERN MEDICAL SCIENCE AND THEIR IGNORANCE
If you are a healer you know what i mean other wise you cant understand what i mean here .Not a single dialogue in this movie is irrelevant or useless. There's always something happening with each scene and you'll be deeply immersed and fascinated by this movie. If you're recommended this movie by someone, the first thing that might come to your mind would be shutter island; after watching it, I assure you it's entirely different. Another thing is that the ending will not disappoint you."
" nice watch!
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,8,"Had a great time watching this movie. I'm not a fan of 'old time-y' films but this was a good watch. The story was so that it kept my interest as I kept wondering where it was going to go with all this and I felt at one point it would turn out a bit clich√©. I was wrong, and never bored getting from one scene to the next. I recommend it but I can't say much more other than I liked the cast (Don't want to spoil it). Great actors/actresses."
" Revealed too early
",2020-10-27 00:00:00,6,"Mental illness is a taff one to portray in movies. You need a lot of sensibility to deal with this subject, here I felt SA worked well. It delivered a faceted and multi dimensional view up to the point where u actually question yourself who are the good and who are the bad ones. Or in other terms, who is actually mentally ill and who or what is simply human... I also loved the setting and overall gothic / Victorian atmosphere (obvious, based on E.A.Poe). The major twist was in my POV revealed too early and from here it was more or less a standard drama/recipe."
" Pretty enjoyable for it's type
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,8,Loaded with a great cast that delivers great performances throughout! I've been meaning to watch this for a few years I'm glad I decided to today. Very good story about mental patients and one of which that is held prisoner even though he shouldn't be. Brad Anderson is a great Director I quite enjoy a few of his projects! I'm usually not a fan of this style but it's way better than expected.
" Ok
",2020-09-04 00:00:00,6,It had a great story but it came out cheesy at times. With the cast it should have been executed better. I'm thinking the director failed here for what he had in the cast and screenplay.
" A scary, psychological, medical movie
",2020-09-03 00:00:00,9,"A young doctor came to asylum and found something irregular and strange. He found all staff very different from normal persons. When he further investigates he found Dr. Lamb (the superintendent) has a violent past.What is his past?
Why all staff so different?
What happened to that young doctor?You have to watch the film to find out all answers.
Obviously, you will be thrilled."
" Edgar Allan Poe influenced this but wow, what a great movie
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,10,"This was so well written and the acting was fantastic. This is by far the best movie I have seen in the past 3 years - maybe minus a few. I understand watching some of the psychotics can be hard to watch but no animals got hurt in the film. Do not stop midway, the show is just starting then. You will understand."
" A Peice of a Puzzle
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,8,"Much like a thriller novel based on Alexander Poe's of Stonehurst Asylum, the storytelling has an interesting turn of events through thriller conventions. Ben Kingsley (antagonist) and Jim Sturgess (protagonist) play powerful characters that deliver thematic art of acting through their delivery to the general audience to gain a sense of emotion a mental readiness"
" If One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was a thriller
",2020-08-02 00:00:00,8,"I watched this film without high expectations because of the rating, but God i was wrong.First of all, this film isn't horror at all, it's psychological thriller with elements of mystery.
The story is much deeper than you would expect, that's why I referenced Forman's classic. It tackles themes of the right way to cure the madness, asking question like is madness a disease or we are all mad in our own way.
It's not just the story that makes this movie great, acting is very good, especially Ben Kingsley. His performance was even better than in Shutter Island.
Directing and photography, lot of memorable scenes, amazing concept and one of the best plot twists at the end.If you loved movie from the title and are keen to watching good mystery/thrillers this film is definitely for you."
" Throughly entertained!! Awesome cast!!
",2020-07-27 00:00:00,10,"This movie has it all the setting, the acting, the direction, the plot, the ending, Absolutely loved it!! This is why we watch movies to be entertained and sometimes touched by a story. Everyone in this movie is fantastic so no need to mention names but look at the cast come on... dont watch the trailers or try to guess anything just please wait back and enjoy!! Wow!! Blown away!!"
" Madness can't be cured
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,10,"This movie stunned me!! As someone who lives with mental illness, i have been committed before and i have suffered inhumane treatment so of course i thought this movie would be all about sadistic, barbaric ways of ""curing"" someone. I WAS WRONG!! It was nothing like i thought it would be and it captivated me right to the end and speaking of the end- big surprise!! I won't spoil it- you must watch this movie!!"
" Based on Edgar Allan Poe's The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,7,"The inmates are running the asylum! Based on Edgar Allan Poe's The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether, this movie even manages to keep some of Poe's comedy, especially the delightful ending, which, may be the best scene in the whole movie though it feels like it's all of one minute. A new doctor comes to Stonehearst to live and work with his newly minted doctorate but instead finds a topsy-turvy world as 1899 turns to 1900."
" Great movie with surprising twist
",2020-03-01 00:00:00,8,"Worth every second, starting with the great performing from the actors and finishing with interesting plot."
" A true gem: completely underrated
",2020-02-03 00:00:00,10,This movie has an all star cast and brilliant characters. It is a movie I can watch over and over. Stonehearst Asylum should be among the classics. Its absolutely beautiful and haunting. You will NOT be disappointed!
" Surprisingly good
",2019-11-15 00:00:00,8,"A good story, sometimes a bit predictable but still very entertaining and with a great twist in the end. Superb acting by Ben Kingsley and several others."
" David Thewlis Filmography Project
",2019-09-27 00:00:00,8,"#9 Stonehearst Asylum or Eliza GravesMickey Finn = The Unhinged CharacterPros: I love this kind of stories because they are insane! a great adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's story and I also liked the fact that Brad Anderson was its director because he is very bold and not afraid to make dark stories or show intense scenes, the cast is good and lend themselves to everything. Mickey Finn is a madman, naughty and boisterous, a kind of perfect/guard in a psychiatric asylum. David perhaps shows his ugliest side ever seen in a movie, the scene of the New Year's Eve party with him and Millie is quite disturbing ... sounds strange but I must admit that the first time I saw I was shocked because seeing it itself is quite disturbing, no doubt this is another role where David dares to interpret something beyond every day by him.Cons: I would have liked David to do more evil with all the other characters, hate the fact that he was the only character to die and be seen in the eyes of others as the only villain (?) which is not true because for me all the characters are crazy and imperfect, especially Ben Kingsley can not stand to see that he did not deserve an adequate punishment, the FX / CGI used throughout the film are bad and I think that is unforgivable, because it really did not require so many and at first glance look a little cheap."
" The Inmates Are Running the Asylum
",2019-09-13 00:00:00,7,(Flash Review)An adaptation of an Edgar Allen Poe story where a young doctor arrives to assist and study at a mental asylum and quickly learns the superintendent is in fact a clever patient and has overrun the actual staff with the help of other patients. The young chap quickly gets a crush on a beautiful piano playing patient and he pleads with her to escape as she doesn't seem to need to be in there. Will he be able to restore 'proper' order to the asylum turned madhouse? Points are made about heavy and cruel asylum therapy vs letting the patient's natural and quirky gifts be allowed to roam free. This is a darkly lit picture with assorted characters and ailments with a decently told story and of an unexpected love story at the core and a few medium effective twists.
" I didnt expect this!
",2019-07-15 00:00:00,8,"I didnt expect that this movie will be good like this. At the beggining it was like, half funny, half crippy. Movie was more and more interesting. The story begins when the main charachter finds out that the boss of hospital is actually their pacient. Then he found place where are the other doctors and he wanted to break free them. Then a lot interesting stuff happened and at the end we found out that thr main charchater is actually a lier and that he escaped from another hospital. That was really good end and unexpected.
I also need to mention good actors who looked like they are really sick and crazy.
Veeery good movie!"
" ....
",2019-07-12 00:00:00,8,"Ben Kingsley as an ""alienist"" set in an isolated asylum in a period drama and it's not Shutter Island. That nust be what made people hate this movie mistly because a lot of the twists were pretty much predictable but still very engaging and entertaining. The moral conundrums of Victorian medical practices are touched upon, but it's the ensemble cast that really elevates the film whenever it looses its footing. Then there's Kate Beckinsale who takes your breath away everytime she's onscreen that you could never blame the protagonist for the lengths he had gone for her."
" Beautiful, well-acted, unrealistic depiction of mental illness
",2019-07-02 00:00:00,8,"This movie was wonderful to look at, wonderfully acted. Even the villains had sympathetic characters. However, the depiction of mental illness as either dysfunctional or catatonic, vs ""all fine"" was became less nuanced as the film progressed, and made light of what began as an complex depiction of mental illness and the way patients are treated. The movies rating would be higher if that complexity and ambiguity in patient versus care giver continued until the end of the film. Ben Kingsley in particular was stunning and played his character in a believable powerful way."
" Kingsley and Kate unite for an awesome overwhelming movie !
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,7,"I am overwhelmed with the smartness and beautifulness of this amazing movie. I thought that I was going to watch a generic movie, or as I like to call them ""sofa chillers"", but the movie delivers in every aspect. It has a lot of mistery elements, much like some of the biggest hits in movie history like Fight Club or Shutter Island. The actors are doing an amazing job, but what else can you expect from Ben and Kate, they never seem to get old or boring it seems. The atmosphere and the setting in the movie is very special, a movie that catches your eye as soon as you see 5 seconds of it. Everything happens in one building, but it seems that scenes never repeat themselfes, every time you see something new that reveals more of the story. The ending is a very good plot twist that gives a new dimension to the movie as a whole. 7-8/10"
" Disaster
",2019-03-09 00:00:00,3,"According to the facts that in the cast of the movie are great names and that the story in based on the story of Edgar Allan Poe, I was expecting to see wow movie, but this is soooo hollow starting from the screenplay. There are many missing points in it and I am not sure that director read it properly in the right way, with understanding and connecting things."
" Predictable non-horror
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,4,"I had high hopes for this movie, given it's stellar cast. But sadly it was awful. It's a bland, predictable story."
" I expected it to be a bit more frightening.
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,6,"You'd think with Stonehearst Asylum's impressive cast (Kate Beckinsale, Ben Kingsley, Kate Beckinsale, Michael Caine, Kate Beckinsale...) and ominous setting it would be quite the thriller, but this movie is bland. It isn't very scary and it isn't very suspenseful. It's not a bad movie, though, and I don't regret watching it (did I mention Kate Beckinsale?). I just expected this Edgar Allan Poe adaptation to be a bit more frightening."
" So much talent and yet it simply never gels.
",2018-09-24 00:00:00,6,"Stonehearst Asylum: 6 out of 10: An all-star cast (Kate Beckinsale, Ben Kingsley, Michael Caine etc) take on a Poe tale about an asylum for the mentally deranged which may not be as it seems. Into this Asylum comes a new doctor (Jim Sturgess) starting his practice who quickly shakes the apple cart as he finds himself obsessing about a woman (Beckinsale) even though she is a patient there. The Good: The acting is solid all the way around. Neither Caine nor Kingsley sleepwalk their way to a paycheck. An activity both (particularly Kingsley) have been guilty of on occasion. (The prosecutor would like to put into states evidence Jaws 4 and BloodRayne). David Thewlis, however, takes his character to the next level. He outshines his peers in a wonderfully nuanced and menacing performance. The production values are also top notch, with delightful Victorian costumes and furnishings. The whole film has a wonderful polished period-perfect look. The Bad: I have a hard time figuring out if Jim Sturgess as the main protagonist is miscast or if his character is simply miswritten. The movie holds some cards so close to the vest that, while certain characterizations make sense in hindsight, it doesn't negate the fact that on the surface Sturgess' doctor simply seems off. Since he is our main protagonist who is in almost every scene and who is the stand-in for the audience it can make for a frustrating viewing experience.The Ugly: The movie keeps up the facade that the new doctor mustn't find out the secret. Even though the new doctor figures it out well before the first act is done. I mean it is as obvious as Ric Ocasek dressed as a woman. Mr. Magoo wouldn't be fooled for long. It creates a weird tension where the New Doctor must not reveal he figured it out even as the evidence piles up in front of him. It is a great idea in a way but the tension never seems to build as it should. It instead comes across as silly.In Conclusion: Well there are no ghosts in the movie and for this I am thankful. I feared ghosts based on the story synopsis and poster art. There is also a great ending (almost a stinger) that almost saves the movie. Unfortunately, the film that precedes the ending simply never seems to be able to create tension, horror, pathos or romance that keeps one invested in the proceedings. The romance between Sturgess' new doctor and Beckinsale's mental patient seems creepy, wrong and something out of middle school. The horror is basically non-existent. Despite Thewlis performance, the tension seems to drain out of every scene. So much talent and yet it simply never gels. An okay film that with the talent involved, simply should have been better."
" tired of stupid and superficial movies
",2018-09-18 00:00:00,1,Only to understand how stupid this movie is: the main character says to a patience that the clinic has been overwhelmed by psychos when it is obvious she knows about it being inside the clinic.
" Must see it!
",2018-09-13 00:00:00,10,"This film has really surprised me a lot, the ending is just speechless. It's very well studied and done."
" Nice Asylum Romance Film
",2018-08-07 00:00:00,7,"This movie wasn't scary. It had creepy elements in it, but it wasn't a horror film. It's more of a Psychological Mystery and Romance. Unique and even had elements of Shutter Island vibes."
" Good Gothic tale but ultimately fails
",2018-07-23 00:00:00,6,"Anything with Michael Caine, Ben Kingsley is well worth watching and indeed for most of the film it is exactly that. A good setting in a 19th century asylum run by a sadistic doctor. Enter our hero shove in a soppy romance. Add in a stuttering finale, throw in a sting in the tail and then spoil it all by an ending straight from a mediocre rom-com. If only they had read the script before filming and thought of what they could have done.
So a good try worth watching but fatally flawed in the end."
" In the mouth of madness
",2018-07-23 00:00:00,6,"Stonehearst Asylum is an uneven gothic thriller relying on several well timed twists. I did think it descended into silliness a bit too often but I guess the final twist maybe explained that off.The film takes apart the treatment of the insane in late 19th century Britain. The opening scenes take place in Bethlem hospital which led to the derivation of the word bedlam. Eliza Graves (Kate Beckinsale) is a mental health patient prodded and probed rather unmercilessly by the doctor who supposedly cares for her.Later on a young enthusiastic medic, Doctor Edward Newgate (Jim Sturgess) arrives at the remote misty Stonehearst Asylum. He is to work with Dr Silas Lamb (Ben Kingsley) who has for the time an odd and kindly approach to the treatment of the insane. However Newgate finds that some of the staff are behaving strangely and later discovers that the lunatics are running the asylum. Somewhere among the ongoing madness Newgate takes an interest with the beautiful Eliza Graves but he needs to escape for his own safety.The film is based on an Edgar Allen Poe short story but it is a bit too flabby, relies too much on the cruel treatment of the insane and then settles on stereotype behaviour from the inmates. There is enough of a story though to give it a pay off and makes you see why that it attracted a cast that also includes Michael Caine and Brendan Gleeson."
" Great movie
",2018-07-08 00:00:00,10,"Believe me or not I cried for Dr Lamb ... and end of the movie was a big surprise 
I really liked it
That was great and I don't understand why the rate of this beautiful movie is not high"
" Surprisingly good
",2018-06-15 00:00:00,8,"I just came across this movie and I really enjoyed it. Great story, solid twists, decent cast, and quality production. It is what it is, a PG13 Hollywood horror mystery."
" Based on a Poe story, so you'd be forgiven for having reasonably high expectations
",2018-05-18 00:00:00,6,"Quite a cast list here and based on a Poe story, so you'd be forgiven for having reasonably high expectations. It's a bit formulaic though, full of Victorian deathly drama. Shadowy, creeping, slightly clunky script and obvious spooky string laden score. With all this mounting up, it doesn't look promising, but there's a dark humour which makes it quite entertaining and after the first half hour has passed, albeit a little predicable it does find its feet. The boundaries blur nicely between who is good and who is mad and it's all made the more watchable by Ben Kingsley, who although is dialling it in a bit, is still very watchable. Which is a good summary... watchable."
" A Must See for Asylum Fans! Outstanding Cast!
",2018-03-30 00:00:00,10,"I really enjoyed this movie. It kept me guessing to thee very end. The cast- Kate Beckingsale(Underworld Series,Vaccancy, Click)Jim Sturgess(Across The Universe,21)
David Thewlis(Fargo,Red 2,Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban) Those three were my favorite characters in the movie but I love them in everything I've seen them in.
Anyway if you like the three actors as I mentioned then you should give this movie a go.
It really deserves better ratings. For the sets, music, the pace, the brilliance of shining a light on something dark. It makes you think till the end. Then you're like whoah such a good movie."
" An unexpected great
",2018-01-28 00:00:00,10,"After seeing a beautiful but also insane woman being used as a guinea pig for a university, Edward decides to become an apprentice at the asylum in which she was kept. Soon after introducing himself and accommodating with his new ""home"", he discovers some disturbing facts which happened there not long ago and that he is the only one able to do something in the respective manner. Charmed by the beautiful Eliza but terrified by Dr. Lamb and his brutes, Edward is determined to find out the truth in order to have a chance with the love of his life.This movie's story, although presented sometimes using gruesome scenes, is captivating and thrilling, keeping you eager to find out what actually happened and what is the faith of the main characters. It has several twists and its finale reveals a very unexpected fact which will leave you simply shocked. Contrary to my expectations, it proved to be a great movie in terms of characters and story, its unpredictability playing a major role in this dark atmosphere. A very good movie!"
" Good film suitable for non- and thriller fans
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,8,I really liked this movie.I thought the ending was going to be expected but it was really cool to be surprised.To be honest it deserves 9 stars but I'm very picky.
" Fantastic and full of detail
",2017-12-02 00:00:00,10,"On IMDb, Stonehearst Asylum is described perfectly in one sentence: ""An Oxford graduate takes up a job in a mental asylum, only to discover that the new treatments are inhumane and there is more going on than meets the eye."" That's all you need to know before watching this film, besides the all-star cast: Jim Sturgess, Kate Beckinsale, Michael Caine, Ben Kingsley, David Thewlis, Brendan Gleeson, and Sinead Cusack. This is a fantastic movie, one that I would add to my lineup of Halloween movies, except that I wouldn't want to wait and only watch it once a year! Jim Sturgess plays the new doctor, and he's mature and charming, which shows a new side to his acting. Fans of his, or anyone who only knows him as ""the Beatles guy"", will be very impressed. Kate Beckinsale is beautiful and mysterious, providing a classy and luminous element to the otherwise spooky setting. Those who have seen Ben Kingsley and Michael Caine together in the hilarious film Without a Clue will be delighted to see them reunited, and with an entirely different screen relationship. . .While most of the film is scary, it's not filled with ""gotcha"" scares or gore. It's very tasteful, and puts the audience in a constant state of suspense rather than frightening them so much so that they won't be able to sleep that night. The lighting and sets truly transport the audience to the time period, and Joe Gangemi fleshes out Edgar Allan Poe's story wonderfully. Brad Anderson's direction includes a wonderful attention to detail, so that when you watch it for the second or sixth time, you're still getting more out of it. With a touch of humor‚ÄîDavid Thewlis's character is named Mickey Finn‚Äîand an incredibly intriguing story, this is a film to treasure. Also, be sure to keep an eye out for Ben Kingsley's son Edmund, in the small role as Kate Beckinsale's husband! Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to some scary scenes, I wouldn't let my kids watch it until they're a little older."
" Omnia Vincit Amor?
",2017-10-14 00:00:00,7,"How do you go wrong with Kate Beckinsale, Michael Caine, and Ben Kingsley all on the same billing? We all have favorite films that each of these has starred in. There are other famous names as well. That aside, who knew that electroshock therapy was invented by a madman? Nice social commentary there, to say the least. (My mother was a victim of EST in the 1950s--for ""hysteria,"" of course, which is nothing more than PTSD for rape victims.) In any case, there are a few twists and turns in the storyline, the acting is, as might be guessed, superb, and the setting is suitably Gothic. There are also no rape or even sex scenes, but there are suggestions. And the only curse word I heard was 'fek.' Violence is up there on the scale. All in all, this isn't for children or the innocent of mind. There is entertainment with social value, and the typical over-the-top-to-ludicrous plot (remember Crimson Peak?) is happily absent."
" Keep your expectations low.
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,6,"I watched this movie mainly because one of the reviewers criticised the IMDb ratings stating that it was highly unjustified and that the movie deserved a 9. So I went ahead and watched it even though I almost always go by the ratings here and then watch a flick.First the good bit- Each and every actor was great in this film. The direction is tense just as it should be for a mystery/thriller movie and you are hooked from the very first scene. As the plot thickens, it shows much promise. I was actually surprised by the twist and then...everything spirals out of control and the suspense towards the end is actually a bit far-fetched/unrealistic and makes you feel extremely disappointed. I'm giving it a 6.5 because of the promise the plot brought to the table and because the actors were great and seemed to give it their all. But I'm vexed at the director who couldn't deliver a great thriller in its entirety when this had so much potential. Oh well, watch it on a rainy day and keep your expectations low. The acting will make up for it I guess.On a separate note, I wish IMDb adds .5 to their 1-10 rating scale."
" A top quality Gothic thriller
",2017-05-11 00:00:00,9,"This film seemingly passed me by, so I was so glad to accidentally stumble across it, I'll say categorically that this is a superb movie. It boasts a tremendous cast, with phenomenal performances in particular from Ben Kingsley and Kate Beckinsale. It boasts fantastic scenery and production values, 1889 is truly brought to life with fabulous costumes and macabre devices. It's a fantastic story, full of suspense and mystery, you feel a sense of unease from the very beginning.Wonderfully dark and sinister, it starts of at a fairly casual pace, but as it develops it becomes more intriguing. Very dark matter, but remains engaging without becoming maudlin. You will keep on asking who the bad guys actually are.If you've ever wondered what happens when the patients take over an asylum this film is for you. 9/10"
" Good story, nicely told, with great performances and sets
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,8,"The characters and acting were superb throughout, making this a very enjoyable film. I loved the story (apart from a couple of very minor flaws) and the sets. There was some good suspenseful moments of anticipation, without it becoming a horror film or too unpleasant. All the leads gave great performances. Recommended."
" Woefully misguided
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,4,"STONEHEARST ASYLUM is another dreadful Hollywood attempt at a horror movie, featuring an all-star cast and an extremely poor story that feels obvious and clich√©d from the very beginning. When the tale is about a fresh young doctor arriving at a remote asylum and discovering some very odd goings-on, you can immediately guess what's really happening and sure enough your thoughts are soon proved right. That this is based on a Poe story means nothing, either, as Poe wouldn't recognise the glossy, slick, and superficial look of this movie.The structure of the film is designed as such to show off the various familiar faces in their various roles. Most of them disappoint, none more so than Jim Sturgess, an utter bore as the weak-willed hero. Ben Kingsley is a little better but seems to be on autopilot and anyone who has seen SEXY BEAST can attest that he can do much better. Jason Flemyng barely appears and Michael Caine can do nothing with an extended bit part. David Thewlis embarrasses himself with his ham acting, but the worst of the bunch is Kate Beckinsale, so incredibly bland in her delivery. You simply cannot understand why anybody would fall in love with her simpering character portrayed here.STONEHEARST ASYLUM is a film that becomes more and more ridiculous as it goes on, with silly action scenes and an electrocution death that looks like it came out of a cartoon. The actors really struggle to impart gravitas in their roles but the script is so poor that everything they say rings hollow. It also goes on way too long, especially during the extended (and stupid) climax. It's a big disappointment."
" Love In Bedlam
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,7,"From a master of mystery & suspense, comes a journey into the dark depths of the mind......well not exactly.This is based on a short story by Edgar Allan Poe, ""The System Of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether."" The term here is ""based"". Because they've tagged on Poe's name they've made it into the horror genre without making a horror film. In fact. there's not much mystery or suspense in this movie either.Don't get me wrong this is a solid story with a great cast of British actors, including good performances from Kate Beckinsale as Eliza Graves, Ben Kingsley as Silas Lamb, David Thewlis as Mickey Finn, Jason Flemyng as Swanwick, and Jim Sturgess as Edward Newgate. Brad Anderson also does a good job of bringing out the performances of the cast and setting a decent atmosphere within the confines of the asylum, not as unsettling and mysterious as it should have been, though.There was plenty of settings and scenes where Anderson could have created tension and suspense, which could have added an oppressive atmosphere to the asylum, making the film stronger and a little darker. For me, this film was too light and required more sense of mystery, given the synopsis of the story - there could have been twist on twist. However, the main storyline was the blossoming love story. This annoyed me as the stronger elements were pushed to the side and even ignored - with all that is lacking in this film, I believe it's more drama than anything else.That said the story was okay but it was the good acting, direction, and location. which kept my attention and my finger from hitting the stop button.A good film but could have been so much more.Worth a watch while cuddled up with your loved one on the sofa.

",2017-03-04 00:00:00,8,"A movie like ""Stonehearst Asylum"" is a mystery to me...not only for its content, but also for the fact that it is known by so few people. It didn't get a major theater release (did it come to any theaters at all?) despite having a great story and an excellent cast.For a basic plot summary, this movie takes place at an insane asylum just as the 19th century is turning into the 20th. A young doctor by the name of Edward Newgate (Jim Sturgess) is finishing his medical training in the study of the insane, and desperately needs some clinical observation and experience. As such, he arrives at Stonehearst and is mentored by the chief doctor of the facility (played by Ben Kingsley). Edward also is rather taken with a female patient named Eliza Graves (Kate Beckinsale), who has seizures at the touch of a man. As Edward begins his rounds, however, he starts to discover that Stonehearst holds a number of secrets that his trainer may not be totally revealing of...especially the people locked in the cellar.I wish I could say more about ""Stonehearst Asylum"", but (much like, say, ""Shutter Island""), it is the type of movie that you don't want spoiled before you view it. It isn't quite in my ""favorites of all-time"" category, but it more than held my interest and was very much an enjoyable experience to watch. A mystery that also examines the treatment of the mentally insane during that time period, as well as plenty of adventure to keep the plot moving.I will say this about ""Stonehearst"", however: DO NOT give up on it before the very end. It is the type of movie that you won't fully understand until the credits roll after the final scene. You just have to use a little patience in that regard. There may be things along the way that you don't understand or that seem too strange to be true, but trust me in that everything is worked out in the end.Overall, ""Stonehearst Asylum"" is a very solid movie that I can't, for the life of me, understand why it didn't at least get a decent theater release. Perhaps because it doesn't appeal to a ""specific target audience"" (in my mind, one of the BEST aspects of predicting a good film). It's a shame, as many people would enjoy this film if they only knew it existed!"
" We're all mad Dr. Newgate. Some are simply not mad enough to admit it.
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,7,"Stonehearst Asylum (AKA: Eliza Graves) is directed by Brad Anderson and adapted to screenplay by Joe Gangemi. It's loosely based on an Edgar Allan Poe short story. It stars Kate Beckinsale, Jim Sturgess, David Thewlis, Ben Kingsley, Michael Caine, Jason Flemyng and Brendan Gleeson. Music is by John Debney and cinematography by Thomas Yatsko.Stonehearst Asylum - Is nothing as it seems?For his latest foray into the horror mystery realm, director Anderson provides a film that is away from conventionality's. The horror here is the blurry lines between sanity and insanity, and it has plenty of tricks and dark humour up its sleeves as well. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out quite early on what is going on at Stonehearst, the makers leave enough clues, but as the ungodly treatments show their hands, and the caustic observations on mental health and the treatment of such are made, there's a strong mystery element booming out of the screen.Naturally this is a tale full of weird, wonderful and scary characters, and with that comes equal helpings of brutality and tenderness. The key characters are very Poesque, all magnificently framed by the Gothic surroundings (where the design department have worked wonders), while Yatsko's photography is gorgeous or chilly as required. Cast come up trumps, the right blend of Gothic ham and emotionally driven portrayals. Savaged by many critics upon release, it has risen above that to gain a deserved fan base, the word of mouth on the street crucially preparing newcomers for the tone of the play. 7/10"
" Uninspiring though watchable
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,6,"This is a decent film with some good performances. It isn't earth shattering but it does have good points.There's no loud intrusive noise, otherwise known as 'music'. Ben Kingsley is suitably menacing and clearly the star of the film while David Thewlis is a suitably menacing supporter if only seen a couple of times. Kate Beckinsale does well as the wrongly (?) committed love interest though strangely none of the villains, nor anyone else, seems to notice her connection with the good 'Doctor' Newgate or that she seems to be totally sane. Jim Sturgess does what Jim Sturgess does and that doesn't need much acting.But the film takes a long time to get going, at least the first 60 minutes are rather slow. From then it becomes more interesting though it does still seem to be a little episodic.The film claims to be based on a short story by one of the great short story writers, Edgar Allan Poe, but adapting a story of a few pages to the 'Big Screen' is always fraught with difficulty. This one goes down as a reasonable, though somewhat uninspiring, attempt, although the ending is unexpected and well done.My vote is lifted to 6 only by the villainous performance of Ben Kingsley as the whole film eventually becomes rather too ridiculous. Kate Beckinsale, supposedly a gentile lady of the first half of the 19th century, head-butting an aggressor really doesn't work.It is watchable and not a bad film. However, it is far from a great one."
" Great acting & unusual plot
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,9,"With a Victorian asylum-based movie, you'd be forgiven for having preconceived notions of how the movie was going to go, but I was pleasantly surprised.Excellent performances from Ben Kingsley & David Thewlis, Kate Beckinsale was also quite good, but I found it frankly odd that Jason Flemyng would take such a minor part after relative success in other movies such as Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and X-Men: First Class. I'd say he deserves bigger roles.This flick gets a 9 from me for the acting, and the interesting ideas that it raises with regard to the treatment of psychiatric patients in those days."
