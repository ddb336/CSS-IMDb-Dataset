" Not funny at all
",2018-04-01 00:00:00,2,"The fact that this movie was big here in Germany explains perfectly why there are so few good ones coming from here. I love silly humor, but this movie's humor is so low-level, wow... the story is not only foreseeable (which you'd expect from a movie like that), it's also completely bananas, full of stereotypes and flat as hell. The characters are hardly describable as one-dimensional, because I don't know if you can call one single character treat per part a dimension. Don't watch it, you're gonna be very unsatisfied."
