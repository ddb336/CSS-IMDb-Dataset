" Preferred Wayward Pines and The Walking Dead
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,2,"Djimon Hounsou was so much better in Wayward Pines. He also had visions of dead people in the series too.
Norman Reedus mumbles his way through this film slightly more clearly than he does The Walking Dead.
I wonder how much elocution lessons would cost Norman? And a haircut.
I suppose he hasn't had much work since the virus stopped shooting of more Walking Dead episodes.
This appears to have been filmed below decks in an old boat.
Anyway, the story is pretty awful, and the direction, and the script and the plot - can't remember if there was one - and the actors really should have turned this one down."
" What would you do to keep on living?
",2021-01-08 00:00:00,8,"In a bleak future breathable air has become nonexistent, so the few people left are forced to live underground in shelters. Engineers Bauer (the excellent Norman Reedus) and Cartwright (an equally fine Djimon Hounsou) are given the daunting task of guarding the last hope for mankind which puts both their lives and sanity at risk.Director/cowriter Christian Cantamessa relates the compelling story at a steady pace, maintains a grimly serious tone throughout, generates a good deal of claustrophobic tension, nicely captures the grinding routine drudgery of the main characters' thankless jobs, and offers an intelligent and provocative examination of the two radically different approaches to survival that basically come down to selfish versus selfless. Reedus and Hounsou tackle the heavy lifting of carrying the movie with commendable skill and conviction while Sandrine Holt makes a favorable impression as the sweet Abby. Norm Li's grayish cinematography provides an appropriately desolate look. A solid little sci-fi film."
" An interesting take.
",2020-11-21 00:00:00,7,"This film involving two maintenance men keeping a facility and it's ""Sleepers"" in preserve to rebuild humanity in an apocalyptic world. The story involving the two men and not so much the world they are in now makes it an interesting emotional take especially if they are what feels like being alone.It could use a little more dynamic of emotion between the two but still makes a point.It's a film that can make you think differently on the situation."
" Great cast and great idea
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,4,Just falls a little short.... had potential though.
" A...I...R...
",2020-09-18 00:00:00,3,"Never heard of this before but when I was flipping through the offerings and saw Norman Reedus playing an engineer in post-apoc future? That sounds like the kind of good-awful B movie fun I can sink my teeth into!Unfortunately, it's kinda close to just being god awful.Right off the bat, this is getting points for concept. A ruined future where chemical weapons have made the air above ground toxic, forcing a portion of humanity into underground bunkers for cryo-stasis while two engineers... I'm sorry, but really? Reedus as an engineer tasked with safeguarding what's left of humanity? C'mon. Next you're gonna tell me that Kevin James played a President who has to save the world from Donkey Kong. Norman, I like you and all but really? I'm supposed to buy that?Anyhow, the story isn't that important. What we have is two guys, stuck in a cramped, confined space until stuff happens. That's about all the explanation the movie gives on it too. I get that stuff breaks and whatnot but this whole thing reeks of plot convenience and then forgetfulness and, frankly it feels generic. When Rockwell was hanging out with himself in Moon it was compelling because he'sa charismatic guy. Reedus and Hounsou are both solid but, as demonstrated here, they lack the chops to pick a subpar movie up and carry it on their shoulders.I mentioned forgetfulness, there's something that happens near the three hour mark of this 6 hour monstrosity... Wait, it's only 94 minutes? Good Lord. I legit thought this has been going for over 2 hours when it finished because it's soooooo sloooooow. But anyhow, big thing happens, it's relevant, important for character, serves as the driving force of the movie until it's just abandoned and everyone is suddenly chill with each other at a time where they REALLY shouldn't be chill!Ugh, this movie. It drags unbelievably, it's boring, it's not particularly well acted and the plot is riddled with holes and conveniences. It gets points for concept and set design, that's about it. This is absolutely not worth watching. Good day to you, Air!
What? Oh, that was the natural end of my review right up there? I wrote a conclusion, gave my viewing recommendation and said goodbye? Pffft! According to Air, I should run for like 10 more minutes after that with pointless nonsense because why not? Why would we want to end in the obvious spot? I mean it's so annoying when things don't know how to just-"
" Had potential
",2020-08-26 00:00:00,4,If they had fleshed this out and included more details this could have been a more enjoyable movie. As it stands its left wanting. It does have some good scenes but not enough to make it adequate let alone satisfying.
" Slow paced, but not too bad. If you can't find sleep, you can watch it.
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,5,"Slow paced, but not too bad. If you can't find sleep, you can watch it.
Other than that, there are many other movies you better watch first."
" Watchable
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,5,Watchable. Similar to Moon but weaker. Sometimes it touches the slow / boring but it never gets to be it completely.
" Bad ending
",2019-11-12 00:00:00,7,"I overall liked the movie. But the ending was really bad. This is a movie where the wimpy  wins and gets his happy ending. He should have been the one who should have died. And then the last scene could have still stayed similar. Where the Norman Reedus character wakes up to the world being safe again.. Pods opening, people waking up and then facing her. And then wondering about the past actions present in the movie. What it took to get there and everything that happened. It's just really unsatisfactory that the other guy lived as he tried to kill him at the pod and was already losing his mind. Or even an ending where they both would have died would have been more satisfactory. The most unlikeable character won everything. It just left a really bad taste in your mouth after the movie ended."
" It only has a three star
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,3,Because of the actors this movies was trash. And I love isolation Movies booooo
" SHE DRIVES ME CRAZY AND I CAN'T HELP MYSELF
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,6,"The government(s) create ""Noah Ark Facilities"" in order to survive the ""tyranny"" as hybrid nuclear and chemical weapons destroy life on earth. Two people are tasked with waking up every six months and perform checks, then go back to sleep. Bauer (Norman Reedus) likes porn and masturbation. Cartwright (Djimon Hounsou) imagines and talks to his wife (Sandrine Holt). Cartwright's sleeper unit becomes damaged which sets the plot in motion as our two try to find a fix.Oh yes, if you come out of the ""high tech coffin"" unit too fast, the oxygen transition can effect the brain.This is a slow paced two man (and one imagined woman) drama with a sci-fi background. It is a character study. The scant details of what happened comes about 20 minutes into the movie. A twist? Sure. The main problem is that we see the same two guys. Eventually I came to dislike Bauer and pity Cartwright, finding myself rooting for someone who may be a touch mentally ill.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" Chamber Play in Apocalyptic-Wonderland
",2018-09-27 00:00:00,7,"A nice little flick with the well-known TWD star Norman Reedus - the whole movie is a kind of chamber play in an apocalyptic setting: what you get is lots of suspense, some twists and an small but pro production. Compared to the last endeavor of the same genre by another TV-show star, Peter Dinklage of Game of Thrones (I Think We're Alone Now ), I prefer this one - yes, the story and the setting is more simplistic but there is far more suspense and a far more coherent story - and good acting too. Good."
" great actors and a lot of expectation are squished
",2018-06-08 00:00:00,7,A fantastic premise; great actors and a lot of expectation are squished by this damp squib of a movie.
" The script lets it down
",2017-10-18 00:00:00,4,"AIR is a generally dull indie two-hander for two popular actors, Norman Reedus of THE WALKING DEAD fame and GLADIATOR star Djimon Hounsou. They play two engineers in a futuristic landscape (glimpsed via some disappointing CGI vistas) where toxic air has killed off most of the population. Their job consists of them doing little more than tending to various instruments, but before long their isolation and claustrophobia sees them falling out. A film like this lives or dies depending on the script, but this one offers little suspense and a whole lot of lazy character-building. Reedus and Hounsou are as good as ever; the rest is a mess."
" Liked it a lot more than I thought I would.
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,9,"The first 1/4 or so hit me as laborious, I found one character just simply annoying, but I stuck with it to the end and I'm glad I did. Prior reviewer's comparison to Moon seem spot-on, except this is a much smaller film. And I might add to that, conceptually similar to Moon, and then there's almost a bit of the video game Portal mixed into the backstory. As I got into it, it started to remind me a little Mamet-ish style, like Oleanna maybe, claustrophobic and in-your-face drama where the surroundings reveal themselves very slowly and with quite a bit of tension (ie, I found myself constantly picturing the stories they're *not* telling you about how they got there). It's films like this and Moon, really with a cast of just 3, that remind me how large casts dilute, there's an intensity a good small cast brings. For anyone into a small film that's a challenging drama and a little time-dystopian sci- fi, I'd definitely recommend."
" an unsettling glimpse into a very possible future
",2017-07-11 00:00:00,8,"an excellent and thought provoking film set in a very realistic and enthralling vision of the future, discussing the toxicity of our civilization and results of an unsettling chemical war. this is a movie definitely for those who love creepy atmospheres and unsettling scenarios, whilst questioning the film's two main character's loyalties to each other and the government."
" tiny cast, big movie
",2017-05-30 00:00:00,8,"I had absolutely no idea what to expect out of this, I've seen both stars in other things and really enjoyed their work, Djimon Hounsou and Norman Reedus were thoroughly brilliant. Excellent choices by the casting director. It was tense and thoughtful throughout and kept me thinking all the way through about how it would end. I thoroughly recommend it."
" Quality low-budget sci fi
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,8,"Science fiction has always been there to ""test us out"" with elements of the familiar in scenarios that are entirely unfamiliar. That's probably a healthy thing, though one is perhaps entitled to question whether it is reasonable to ""see how human beings behave"" in a largely fantastic (in this case dystopian) scenario to which are added so many specific and contrived conditions (problems) that the already-inconceivable-looking scenario is made less possible by far. In essence, this is what Christian Cantamessa's ""Air"" does, and in so doing it in some sense resembles, for example, the films of the ""Cube"" series (though those were glossy and high-tech in their cruelty, while here all is shabby and grey). Still, in ""Air"" too, both cast (that's basically three players, and mainly just a pretty-Daryl-ish Norman Reedus plus the at-first-sight somewhat strange bedfellow of Djimon Hounsou) and audience are made to jump through hoops a bit to accept what's going on. There's also more than a hint of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" in here, as well as the recent (i.e. later-than-2015) ""Passengers"".So does ""Air"" have enough to offer either a general audience, or else that more specific subset of people who are already die-hard sci-fi fans? I will elect to answer that question from the point of view of somebody included in the latter category and say ""yes"". Ultimately, this is an imaginative and intriguing film in which our route to the shocking dystopia it portrays is just about fleshed out enough to engender a shudder and a measure of satisfaction among we ""experts"" in things that could go wrong with the Earth. It also does well enough at portraying the simultaneously dull yet creepy mini-world that has remained habitable in the midst of catastrophic destruction. Occasionally that confined world has a measure of cosiness, more often it seems claustrophobic, but the imagination takes flight and the empathy turns on when one is made to realise that that is now ""all there is"". The storyline reminds us repeatedly that this was a last-minute effort cobbled together to try and save something as opposed to nothing, and this is rather a first in movies of this ilk, and somewhat poignant it is too, at least at times.Indeed, so relatively slapdash and Heath Robinson is much of this that our two key characters have few options to work with, yet do keep working hard to expand that list. And given the very specific way they do their jobs (coming out of stasis only periodically for very strictly-limited periods of time), it is true to say that at most moments in the film we viewers have little or no idea of what will follow. Maybe that throws up expectations that can't be met on occasion, but it must also be seen as something reasonably fresh and unique in a film.Ultimately, people are people, and even the scale of our heroes' responsibility (which we are reminded of repeatedly) and the measure of the dystopian challenge cannot suffice to allow our two maintenance men to go on robot-like, doing the job without emotion. Rather, emotion tends to take over, as well it actually might under such extreme circumstances , so fair enough. The very final segment goes with that, but is far less successful, and indeed looks surplus to requirements in what is otherwise a pretty well-imagined and taut piece of film-making supplying a truly awful end of the world on a shoestring, but actually rather well; and offering us a thought-provoking and unpredictable storyline on the back of two seemingly randomly-selected actors who actually gel effectively enough."
" Illogical and annoying
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,5,"I just can't forgive lazy writing. The plot was good but wasn't delivered effectively. I don't blame the acting (though its hard not to see Norman as Darryl (especially as he is rocking the same look as TWD series).Essentially I found it hard to believe that Bauer descends so quickly into a murderous rage when the sleep pod malfunctions and almost kills him. When he reviews the footage and sees Cartwright was almost catatonic at the time, surely his first impression would be to confront him about his delusions.Why the hell would they pump air into that huge facility each time the wake up when 2 people would use a fraction of the air by wearing suits and breathing bottled air? This is the most glaring logic flaw. You could last for days on the air remaining inside the facility without any re-circulation machinery running.How does Cartwright get all the way to the top of the silo and look out over the broken city and then get back in time? It looks like the site was nuked so how does their silo survive without a single indication. It is right next door to the destroyed one.How does Cartwright survive getting shot?How does Bauer know ""it's all a lie"" when they have no way of knowing if the other facilities are on line or not.Too many questions. Too many failures of logic."
