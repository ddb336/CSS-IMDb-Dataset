" A confused script and lackluster direction!
",2021-03-31 00:00:00,1,Terrible movie! A waste of my time. I couldn't even understand the point of it all. Women's empowerment or showcasing a woman on the verge of insanity!
" Predictable, but still very good
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,8,"There are a lot of reasons to like this film and one of them is the acting. Everyone does a great job and the characters are well written as well. I guessed the surprise twist ending really early on as it is pretty predictable, but the rest of the film is wonderfully done. Good cinematography, good pacing and mood. Already mentioned the acting was excellent. Even with the predictability, it's a really good ending too."
" Needed a much grittier leading man...
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,6,"I have to admit that I usually love this kind of film - the whole Golem/Jack the Ripper mystery from the seedier east end of Victorian London is usually good for a suspenseful, character driven story that still - even today - fuels as many conspiracy theories as it solves! Sadly, though, my heart sank when I saw the cast list and for the most part, they really disappoint. Bill Nighy only has one gear when he acts; it works on occasion comedically, but in this role he is just plain wooden as ""Insp. Kildare"", the detective charged with investigating a series of brutal murders. The focus of his efforts becomes a playhouse of bawdy actors - led by the pretty but, overly hammy, Douglas Booth (""Leno"") and aspiring actress Olivia Cooke (""Lizzie"") - and as he and his efficient sidekick ""Flood"" (George Mays) begin to hone in on their potential culprit, the tension starts to build up nicely. The plot is well written, actually quite eerily sophisticated and Cooke really does deliver her complex, manipulative persona convincingly enough. The creative detail is great to look at - particularly the more visceral, brutal scenes - and the intriguing story has multiple threads and twists to keep us guessing about just about everything. Sadly, though, Nighy is just too refined, sterile even, and just drags the pace down into unwanted melodrama territory way too often. Nice score from Johan Söderqvist, though..."
" Entertaining but predictable
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,6,"I loved the set design and fashion, Bill Nighy was decent, loved the guy playing the comedian/actor. There was enough 'horror' and gore to keep entertained.
But all in all the twist wasn't a twist for me. I'm not sure if we were meant to be surprised at the end or not??"
" Beautifully shot if a bit confusing
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,7,"The Limehouse Golem is a film I definitely would recommend if you enjoy this sort of thriller, if a bit hesitantly as it's not a masterpiece and perhaps a bit underwritten in parts and overwritten in others. I actually don't think I saw the big twist at the end, other reviewers say they have but maybe I'm just a touch slow to catch on as I haven't watched a tremendous amount of these sort of whodunnit films.The cinematography is excellent and unquestionably the highlight of the film. Bill Nighy puts up an admirable performance and the rest of the cast do decently although none stand out as amazing.The plot is very intelligent in parts but overall I felt like it wasn't connected as well as it could have been and the ending was a bit of a stretch although a satisfactory conclusion overall.7/10: Good period thriller"
" Decent story laced with medicare acting
",2020-11-30 00:00:00,4,"The Limehouse Golum - C+ (Flawed but Worthy)Decent story and production laced with mediocre ever changing accent of most actors except Bill Nighy. The story was very interesting but you can not overlook bad editing, acting and overall presentation.Story would have benefited with seasoned director and actors with Bill Nighy."
" Good acting, uninspired storytelling.
",2020-11-05 00:00:00,5,"The acting was overall very good across the board. It was probably the only reason I kept watching. The story was predictable and the ending disappointing. I continually told my wife ""if -person- is the killer, then that'll be really obvious and dumb"" and so it was obvious and dumb in the end. It really just made all the red herrings pretty pointless - each one was more absurd than the last. The movie is worth a watch if you're a Bill Nighy fan. Otherwise skip it."
" Over stylised pre-Jack the Ripper London East End set serial killer thriller
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,6,"In 19th century London, pre-Jack the Ripper, there is a serial killer known as the Limehouse Golem gratuitously murdering people. A detective (Bill Nighy) moves his investigation to an East End music hall where he believes a woman's dead husband (Sam Reid) is the Golem.A patchy piece of grand guignol based off a novel by Peter Ackroyd. The gruesome murders are handled well and of course comparisons to the Ripper crimes are inevitable. Meanwhile the manner in which London is depicted and the music halls are over stylised. In the film Karl Marx (Henry Goodman) as one of the peripheral characters is portrayed as a nobody, though he had written most of his best known works long before the 1880s when the film is set and died in 1883."
" SERIOUSLY a 6 no way!!, an absolute MASTERPIECE!!! A10!!!!!!!
",2020-10-24 00:00:00,10,"Everything about this flawless masterpiece is spot on from the cinematography to the phenomenal acting to the creative incredible ending!! Not 1 actor/actress wasn't incredible, the story takes you on a mystery thriller ride to a incredible ending. The filming is amazing I felt like I was in London 1880. Bill nighy shows why he should be considered one of the top tier actors out right now. All I can say is get a big bowl of popcorn and sit back and enjoy a sherlock Holmes meets sixth sense!!!!!!"
" Nice twist...er twists
",2020-10-15 00:00:00,7,"Chose this because it's Halloween week and love Bill Nighy. In all honesty, did not hold my attention but better than the usual dull crap on TV. As others have noted, visually interesting, though vey ""yellow""-perhaps more authentic than the period is usually depicted but likely given the smog common to that time. Good performances overall, interesting plot, but slow. Nice twists at the end, just a long time getting there."
" If you want your name etched in stone, you're gonna have to take up the chisel yourself
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,8,"A visually stunning film with beautiful aesthetic appeal. It would have become one of my all time favourite films set in the alluring Victorian era if not for the linear and underwhelming mystery, the obvious signs and no so subtle clues to the identity of the Limehouse golem.You have an inkling of the killers persona about a quarter of an hour into the film and basically your instincts and gut feel are correct.Maybe the film didn't give us enough curveballs or clever twists to change our thought pattern. Instead the writers threw everything at us early in the piece with strong hints of the possible suspects and left the investigation and enigma of the golem obvious and a tad flat.The cast in this film were absolutely phenomenal and were made for their roles. Bill Nighy as Inspector John Kildare has such a strong presence on screen and a sense of aura which heightens the performance of all those around him. I thought that Douglas Booth was just sensational and he probably stole the show with his portrayal of Dan Leno. Olivia Cooke as Lizzie Cree felt vulnerable and exploited and played her character to the best of her ability considering what she had to work with.I had some expectations of the film and they were all overwhelmingly met in this well directed, well cast and well shot movie. The visual locations were simply outstanding. The characters were appealing, the murders were gruesome and the story was gripping. The ending was done much better than the mystery of the golem but otherwise there were little to no faults with this film and it will always be part of my collection for me to go back and watch again.8/10"
" Bravo!!! Wow!!
",2020-07-05 00:00:00,10,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and you will too. I love period pieces and i love detective stories. This one had it all.
" Poor
",2020-07-03 00:00:00,3,"All round a film experience i shall instantly forget and never wish to recall. Poor performances, sub-standard dialogue it is plain dull.It has the usual, hollywood high gloss sheen with no depth to the characters making an emotional connection impossible therefore a dramatic failure. So all being left to engage with is the investigative part of the film. This part feels unrewarding also.It is directed with no trace of flair or ingenuity just standard point n shoot stuff making it feel plodding without any mystery or subversiveness. Tonally it shifts all over the shop too.Would not recommend."
" Do you want to see a movie that makes no sense?
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,5,"Well watch this. Is it about a play? Is it about persecuting Jews? Is it about a monster or golem? Is it about the worlds most naive detective? They sure do have a bunch of different accents. I'm just not sure. Why didn't she drink her beer or wait for her baked potato? She married that guy?? When, did I miss a scene? The scenery and costumes are great. wigs meh. Had potential but what's happening?"
" Atmospheric and Stylish
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,9,"I was transfixed by this stylized thriller. The dark 1880s London atmosphere was created to perfection. Douglas Booth and Olivia Cooke had my eyes riveted to the screen with their nuanced performances. I liked the eerie music, stunning costumes, unpredictable plot, and layers of interpretation.I could not figure out who was guilty and who was innocent, although I think clues must've been dropped along the way. I am probably going to rewatch the movie tomorrow and see how the mysteries all piece together."
" The Limehouse Golem
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,5,"I wasn't sure about this film when it was in the cinemas, but I read about it was when it was shown on television, it was rated well by critics and sounded worth watching. Basically, in Victorian London, series of murders in the docklands has shaken the community of Limehouse. Journalists dub the serial killer on the loose as the Golem, after the Jewish legend. On the same night as the last Golem murder, music hall performer Elizabeth ""Lizzie"" Cree (Olivia Cooke) is arrested, accused of poisoning her husband, John Cree (Sam Reid). Scotland Yard assigns the case to seasoned detective Inspector John Kildare (Bill Nighy). He discovers evidence linking John Cree to the Golem murders and wants to solve the cases before Elizabeth is hanged. Kildare finds a diary written by the Golem of the crimes, handwritten in the pages of a Fine Arts book from the reading room of the library in the British Museum. He deduces that the Golem must be one of the four men who last entered the library: Dan Leno (Douglas Booth), Karl Marx (Henry Goodman), George Gissing (Morgan Watkins) and John Cree. Kildare acquires handwriting samples of the other three men, while listening to Elizabeth's story. Elizabeth was the second most popular performer in the troupe, after Leno, performing comedy songs, but she aspired to also become a dramatic actress. John Cree, a struggling playwright wooed her, and offered her a leading part in his new play. Her fellow performer, Aveline Ortega (María Valverde), became jealous and sabotaged her first dramatic role. Elizabeth is entrapped by the theatre's owner, known as ""Uncle"" (Eddie Marsan), forced to pose for nude photographs and beat him for his sexual gratification. Elizabeth accepted John's offer of marriage in order to keep her safe, and Kildare notes that Uncle died suddenly days later, leaving the theatre to Leno. John's career stalls and grew bitter towards Elizabeth as she is supporting them both financially and started having an affair with Aveline Ortega (María Valverde). The two remain estranged until John Cree's poisoning. Elizabeth is found guilty of poisoning and sentenced to death by hanging, but Kildare finally finds a handwritten copy of the play written by Cree before his death and has Elizabeth's sentence postponed for one hour. He hopes to prove John Cree as the killer, but during his conversation with Elizabeth, he realises that she is the Golem rather than her husband. She killed Uncle and began committing the murders, to make a lasting name for herself, poisoning her husband when he found evidence of her crimes. Shocked by the truth, Kildare chooses to delay the revelation until after Elizabeth's hanging, granting her the ""fame"" of eliminating the Golem rather than greater fame as being a killer. Meanwhile, Dan Leno's troupe perform John's play, during which Aveline Ortega, playing the part of Elizabeth, dies accidentally during the hanging scene. Leno covers up the death and takes the curtain call dressed as Elizabeth and we see Elizabeth take a bow on stage with him. Also starring Daniel Mays as George Flood, Paul Ritter as Augustus Rowley, Peter Sullivan as Inspector Roberts, The Hobbit's Adam Brown as Mr. Gerrard and David Bamber as Mr. Greatorex. Nighy is reasonable as the leading inspector, and there is good support from Cooke, there are the occasional gory moments, and it is interesting to follow the clues, it was a little too chatty for my liking, but it's a reasonable period murder mystery. Worth watching, in my opinion!"
" Great Victorian murder mystery
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,8,"Starts off pretty gory, but the hotel doesn't overwhelm the story."
" A FASCINATING POLICE PROCEDURAL
",2020-02-29 00:00:00,9,"When you happen on a fairly obscure title like this, you can only hope it will be this good. The detail - the sets and costumes - seem eerily realistic. We enjoyed following along with the investigation and were not prepared for the thrilling ending. Highly recommend this Jack the Ripper type story."
" Lively portrait of a dangerous 19th century London
",2020-01-22 00:00:00,9,"The casting for The Limehouse Golem was certainly on the money. No actor disappoints in that regard. If you like Sherlock Holmes or movies such as From Hell (2001) then you'll love this. The murderer in this case would probably be an early hero of Hannibal Lector. Highly energised London characters come to life, particularly around the theatre, which is a precious insight in itself, and a delight. I can't remember another movie doing music halls so well. Very entertaining. The editing between music hall and streets is superb. Great effort has gone its sets and lighting, and all the props and extras necessary to recreate the London 1880 atmosphere. The who-dun-it side of things is also done well, and in an original way, but it is precisely that way that keeps ticking off the suspects and thus narrowing the pool, so that by the end your guess is on even money. Mind you, by that stage you've pretty much enjoyed the whole movie so it's not such a drag. Bill Nighy shoulders the focus, and does it really well. If you are a fan of his style this is gold. I hope he reappears in another adventure in this same world. I was slightly disabused toward the end when I thought there were too many secret reveals, particularly in regard to secret character foibles, but I guess that is the writers aiming for a modern expectation. Regardless, it's all done really well, and The Limehouse Golem will certainly be regarded both as one of the finer period pieces of its year, as well as great horror."
" Over acting
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,5,So over the top it began to feel like a spoof.. they have turned it from a hard nose crime drama to a comedy. Don't get me wrong it's watchable but don't expect much
" Terrible Authenticity
",2020-01-01 00:00:00,6,"Always a treat to see Bill Nighy and the rest of the cast put in a good show but the production has the appearance of a good thing spoilt by someone who had completely another film in mind. It's as if it was made for and by mindless people who needed to be reminded how horrific murders are, well, horrific. They also don't understand recorded history. I guess I was never sold on it when the library scenes popped up, they were filmed in Manchester and seeing a scale model of Stephenson's Rocket that represented an 'average scene in Victorian Britain' wasn't even the worse. The film is set in 1880. Dan Leno was born in 1860. The main female character sees him as a major music hall hero when he was 5 years old. Bad editing and bad production that could have been a lot better. It's as if an obdurate owner of a tabloid wanted to make a story without realising their solipism.
Miss."
" The Limehouse Golem
",2020-01-01 00:00:00,5,Jane Goldman adapts Peter Ackroyd's novel. The film is a mystery with a false narrator that ends up being convoluted and uninspired with an uneven tone.Set in pre Jack the Ripper London of the 1880s. Scotland Yard police inspector John Kildare (Bill Nighy) investigates a series of grisly murders in the Limehouse area.Kildare discovers evidence linking playwright John Cree to the Golem murders and he wants to solve the cases before Cree's wife Elizabeth is hanged. She has been accused of murdering her husband.The film is lustily camp with suspects that include Karl Marx. However the misdirection never worked for me. It is watchable and clearly a labour of love for the director working with a low budget.
" Meh
",2019-12-31 00:00:00,3,I knew who the killer was 20 minutes into the movie.
" Good looking movie but lacking in mystery
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,6,"Listed as a horror movie in my TV guide The Limehouse Golem is a murder mystery set in Victorian London. It does contain some very graphic violence which will appeal to some horror fans, on the flip side too much drama for others. No mention of Jack the Ripper but there are many similarities.
It is very well filmed, excellent sets and costumes, and it has a good cast. In addition to the gore there are a few scenes of sex and nudity, this is a strictly adult drama. On the downside I found the film a little too long (slightly boring) and the mystery of who the killer is pretty obvious. There are a number of suspects, each play out a murder scene and for some reason the film makers thought it a good idea to give them distorted, ""evil"" voices, I found this utterly ridiculous.
Too much drama to be called a horror movie, too much gore to be called a drama, it sits somewhere in between."
" Very good
",2019-12-29 00:00:00,7,"If yu like Victorian crime dramas then your like this , good production values with Bill Nighy well cast in the lead , entire cast come to that and there's a couple of red herrings chucked in for good measure"
" Misery Junction
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,8,"A good-looking gaslit Victorian murder mystery set in 1880 with a classy cast of actors (including Bill Nighy and Eddie Marsan) and suspects (including Karl Marx and George Gissing), a powerhouse performance by Olivia Cooke as a music hall actress and pioneer of male impersonation; and a satisfying conclusion."
" Creepy and eerie story that follows a Jack the Ripper-style serial killer nicknamed the Limehouse Golem.
",2019-12-26 00:00:00,7,"Brilliant terror film and well played , dealing with ominous murders committed in London . A scary , ghastly , fictitious story based on a work of fiction but including some actual roles living in London at the time the movie is set. As the picture is set in Victorian London, there a Scotland Yard inspector called John Kildare (Bill Nighy , this role was initially given to Alan Rickman , but due to his illness he turned down) helped by a cop named George Flood (Daniel Mays) are exhaustively seeking clues about grisly killings , as John attempts to hunt down the sadistic killer behind a series of gory , Jack the Ripper-Like murders . During his quest , he finds strange conclusions , as Kildare will exhume terrifying secrets and astonishing discoveries . And a series of odd events will shock him when he searches for clues through a public library . There are several suspect people , a beautiful young Lizzie Cree (Olivia Cooke) who is detained , and various stage actors as Dan Leno (Douglas Booth) , Aveline Ortega (María Valverde) , Uncle (Eddie Marsan) , among others . Who is the killer ? . Then horrible , violent deeds begin to occur and other hideous murders take place. Before the Ripper, fear had another name.United Kingdom horror film in whodunit style , set in London full of thrills , suspense , chills , red herrings , creepy twists and turns . This scary , bizarre film contains tension , thriller , drama , mystery , plot twists and shocks , including decent scares with horrifying sequences especially in its final part , in a tense denouement . A luxurious British production with a timeline that spans along XIX century , and throughout a Victorian London in which happens dreadful murders allegedly committed by a weird Jewish creature , The Golem . It suffers from some sputtering about a quarter of the way in , the sputtering came from a complete change in story direction , which suffers from some slow-moving scenes , away from the spectacular stage acting in which actors play pretended killings and toward a very complex story line with a lot of suspicious people . In fact, the suspect people include some actual characters who at the time live in London : Karl Marx, George Gissing and Dan Leno . Interesting and amazing screenplay by Jane Goldman based on the novel by Peter Ackroyd , revolving a prime suspect woman , a Police Inspector and the various amazing surprises he finds . The motion picture is pretty well , although sometimes deliberate pacing and packs a lot of turns ; however , being entertaining for continuous suspense and unsettling , awful atmosphere . The picture is thrilling and some moment brilliant, and the players are quite reliable . Ghastly movie builds taut by showing virtually well staged set pieces , evocative settings , adequate soundtrack and rousing cinematography . Few disagree that the film is professionally mounted , the performances solid , and that it respectfully carries on the tradition of ¨Hammer"" horror films , borrowing several elements here and there . Colorful cinematography by Simon Dennis , showing splendidly the shading and dark streets from London . Eerie as well as frightening musical score by Johan Söderqvist who has composed for successful films as ¨Let the right one in¨ , ¨Bron¨, ¨In a better world¨, ¨After the wedding¨, ""King of Devil's Island"" and ¨Kon-Tiki¨ .This is an enjoyable as well as nicely set picture , displaying genuine chills , suspense , mystery and dark atmosphere and twisted finale , being skillfully proceeded by the Spanish filmmaker Juan Carlos Medina and turned out to one of the most unusual British thrilling movies of 2016 and certainly one of the most unsettling . Juan Carlos Medina is a good director and writer, known for ¨Painless¨ with Alex Brendemhul , Derek De Lint , Irene Montalá , his first and most successful film that premiered in various International Festivals , he previously directed shorts . Eventually , Juan Carlos Medina is set to direct this crime-thriller ¨The Limehouse Golem¨, also known as ""Dan Leno and The Limehouse Golem"" , ¨Golem, le tueur de Londres¨, ¨Das Monster von London¨ , and ¨Los misteriosos asesinatos de Limehouse¨. Medina's also directed episodes of notorious TV series as ¨A Discovery of Witches¨ and ¨Origin¨ ."
" Very Clever
",2019-12-14 00:00:00,8,This was a film that we just picked at random without knowing anything about it and were pleasantly surprised. It is dark and grim but very clever and suspenseful right up until the end. Bill Nighy and Daniel Mays are excellent as always but a particularly good performance by Olivia Cooke. Very enjoyable.
" Gripping intelligent
",2019-12-10 00:00:00,8,"Came across this film on prime. Gripping intelligent, well acted and directed.
Deserves to be better known."
" Intriguing.
",2019-11-14 00:00:00,7,"Accurate choice for an enjoyable murder mystery story, set in 19th century London, with a great gothic aesthetic, with its natural mystery elements such as the dark streets where murder is bound to occur and shady characters whom are all worthy of being suspects. Bill Nighy and Olivia Cooke deliver notable performances along with Douglas Booth's interesting portrayal of Dan Leno, a renowned music hall comedian. Quickly the situation turns into a whodunnit, as we are in front of a murder, with evidence of it being linked to unthinkable suspects. So the investigation begins and it takes us to places we want to go along, with some viewers quickly guessing the culprit, it is still fun to see where the destination is headed. That is one of the best things about this film, that is greatly captivating and intriguing in its tale.Unfortunately, this film didn't manage to find an audience, hence the low amount of ratings it has here on , so it flew under the radar. Nonetheless, it's appealing enough to give it a fair chance."
" Amazing sets, good performances... should have been better
",2019-11-01 00:00:00,5,"I wanted to love this. And I feel like I should have. But I didn't. I was interested in it enough to see it all the way through the end to find out the conclusion of the central mystery. Why was it just okay? I'm not sure. The performances were strong, and the period sets and costumes were amazing, but I would find my mind drifting throughout it, a lot. Too much. So I can only chalk it up to the script and the directing. The shots themselves in the movie were good. It looked beautiful.But for whatever reason, I was never fully pulled in. And I think this was in large part because the crimes of the Limehouse Golem were all told as flashbacks essentially, there was no real suspense, except for one scene near the very end that I won't spoil. So yeah, ultimately I think the storytelling structure diminished the sense of suspense that should have been present in the story. The movie is also pretty violent/gory in those flashbacks, btw. That neither raised nor lowered my overall score of it, but it was violent enough that it's worth noting."
" ""The public want blood. The Golem provides it.""
",2019-10-25 00:00:00,8,"The Limehouse Golem is a period mystery/thriller set in Victorian England just before the time of Jack the Ripper. The Golem has committed a series of brutal murders (not unlike the Ripper), leaving tantalizing clues and mocking riddles for the police. Scotland Yard Inspector John Kildare (Bill Nighy) is tasked with the seemingly impossible job of tracking down the Golem. Kildare develops a list of four possible suspects - one of whom has recently been killed and his widow, Lizzie Cree (Olivia Cooke), is on trial for his murder. Kildare is convinced that by helping LIzzie, it may help unmask the Golem.It's difficult to write about a film like The Limehouse Golem without mentioning spoilers. There's a great twist at the end that I'll do my best not to give away. I don't think that mentioning the fact that there is a twist is a spoiler because it seems that all modern movies feature a twist near the finale. While I'm usually pretty good at spotting movie twists, this one completely caught me off guard. I realize now that the clues were there, but like Kildare, I didn't see them.As much as I enjoyed The Limehouse Golem, at first, I was put off by all the music hall nonsense. I just about stop watching. After finishing the movie, I realize now how important these scenes are. They help establish mood and character vital to the plot.Visually, The Limehouse Golem is amazing. Victorian London never looked so gloomy and dirty. Sets, set design, costuming, lighting, and cinematography are all top notch. Whether it's the filthy streets, the stuffy library, and the raunchy music hall, each looks stunning it its own right and each is filmed beautifully. The special effects also add a lot to the film. I've read that some people consider the blood and violence over-the-top and even gratuitous, but I couldn't disagree more. Murder is not a pretty thing - especially murders as gruesome as those committed by the Golem. The sudden and often unexpected violence adds immensely to the film's overall aesthetic.I can't say enough positives about the acting in this movie. The three main actors, Nighy, Cooke, and Douglas Booth give fantastic performances. I think I was as impressed with Booth as anyone. The extremes in his character are played to perfection. Whether it's performing in drag or defending himself from murder accusations, the acting is spot-on. The supporting cast is equally strong.Finally, there's a plot device used in The Limehouse Golem that I found particularly enjoyable and effective. As Kildare considers each of his four suspects, he reads a portion of the killer's ""diary"" detailing a unique murder. As he reads, we see inside Kildare's mind as he pictures each suspect commit the act. It's a unique and interesting means of telling the story.8/10"
" Solid
",2019-10-25 00:00:00,7,"Entertaining to watch who likes mystery and costume drama (it's not actually horror) , but nothing more than that. Very predictable. Acting was good, especially by Douglas Booth."
" Interesting But Not Really Engrossing
",2019-09-02 00:00:00,6,"I'd have to call this movie intriguing rather than engrossing. The story is reasonably interesting. It focuses on the investigation into a series of Jack the Ripper-style murders in Victorian London in the 1880's committed by a killer who was known as The Limestone Golem. Alongside that investigation is the story (and trial) of a young woman and music hall actress named Elizabeth (Olivia Cooke) accused of poisoning her husband. Inspector Kildare of Scotland Yard (played by Bill Nighy) is assigned to investigate the Golem murders and also becomes involved with Elizabeth's case as he begins to think that her deceased husband might have been the Golem.What I found most intriguing about this movie was the way in which actual historical figures of the time were woven into the plot. Dan Leno (Douglas Booth) was in fact a very famous British actor of the day; George Gissing (Margan Watkins) was a British novelist of the day and Karl Marx (Henry Goodman) really did live in London at the time. Leno, Gissing and Marx all became suspects in the Golem murders. I thought the fictional story managed to incorporate them into the plot very well and very believably. The performances were good. The setting of the movie seemed authentic. There was a Victorian feel to this movie in both the sets and the dialogue, and it was interesting to get a bit of the taste of what it migt have been like behind the scenes of a London music hall of that era. All that was well done.The story, however, seemed somewhat choppy to me. I wasn't taken with the flow of the movie; it seemed inconsistent from beginning to end. At times it also seemed as if a little bit too much effort was being put in to trying to keep the viewer guessing, but the end result (for me) was times of confusion over the story more than anything. The ""twist"" in the plot as the murderer was finally revealed took me by surprise (which I appreciated) but then the movie went on for a little bit too long. Once the twist was revealed I was ready for the story itself to come to an end, and I thought the last few scenes (once the identity of the Golem had been revealed) were superfluous.It was an interesting movie, even if it was a little bit uneven. Overall, I'd say it deserves a 6/10."
" One of Bill Nighy's best
",2019-08-18 00:00:00,9,"This film is a little gem that I won't soon forget. The portrait of 19th century London that comes with this story is pretty indelible, a city where the poor are willing to sell their children, parents abuse their children and the police still hang people. Despite the brutal murders at the center of this film there's a lighter side where a beautiful, talented young woman blossoms as a music hall star. For this part, Olivia Cooke is a wonderful choice, she's very charming and a great find. Her interactions with Nighy and her mentor in the entertainment world, played by Douglas Booth, are all wonderful. Add a few scenes in the British Library and you have a very entertaining movie directed beautifully by a director I don't know but with an excellent eye.The movie is based on a novel and eventually shows it, but it's fun and shows great promise. I intend to pick up the director's other film, Painless, assuming it's out on DVD."
" Predictable.
",2019-08-09 00:00:00,4,"A film with potential that, sadly, was never used. Cinematography is good with great atmospheric lighting and superb camerawork. The acting is decent enough, but the script is simply too thin to carry any real weight. The plot ""twist"" is painfully clear from the very beginning, even though it tries far too hard to be oblique, that it makes every single dialogue feel ridiculous. Add to that the uneven pacing and uneven character creation... and you have a solid ""might have been""."
" my notes
",2019-07-25 00:00:00,1,"I didn't care for it. at all. i finished on 2.0 speed while half watching. i just didn't care. maybe i've lost my patience with low level movies. i normally HAVE to see how something finishes. i didn't even want to know, not sure why i didn't just stop it. (1 viewing)
SPOILERS
i also guessed the ending. while i was still giving it a chance i guessed that the main chick would be the killer, and i wasn't even trying to figure it out. so even if i stuck with it, it wouldn't have paid off"
" Entertaining, Not Perfect.
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,7,"I really struggled with whether or not to give this movie a 3 or a 3.5 star, and I settled with 3.5. This movie appeals to me in ways that I'm sure it wont appeal to others, so for me personally, that was enough to add another ½ star. I generally like grimmer stories set in Victorian times- and I have a particularly morbid fascination with serial killers like Jack the Ripper and H.H. Holmes (I'm not psycho- I swear... but isn't that just what a psycho would say? *laughs maliciously*), I like costume dramas and murder mysteries, I like Bill Nighy and Olivia Cooke, and I liked the unconventional way this film told its story, even if I could predict the ending... Perfect, this movie is not; entertaining, it certainly is."
" Dark and Sinister
",2019-05-30 00:00:00,8,"""The Limehouse Golem"" tells the story of a series of bloody murders that become quite personal for the investigator when he simultaneously seeks justice for a young woman who is in the crossfire of accusations.This film reminded me so much of the new adaption of ""The witness for the prosecution"" that in fact I find it rather hard not to mix up plot elements. I very much liked the dark and sinister atmosphere of this film and I think that the acting is really good. There's a slight danger of getting to shrill at times but apart from the ending that really is a bit too much, most often producers manage to get around. The plot is thrilling and has you emotionally involved and I can overall recommend a watch.All in all this is a tiny bit weaker than ""The witness for the prosecution"" but only because it fails to limit itself in the end. Apart from that this is more than average and more than solid work from everyone involved."
" Extremely boring + bad directing
",2019-05-07 00:00:00,1,Extremely boring + bad directing....I couldn't watch the entire thing. Why in gods name was it made?
" ""I seem to ignite the urge in men.""
",2019-04-12 00:00:00,8,"The movie evokes both the literary legacy of Sherlock Holmes and the historical saga of Jack the Ripper. The costuming and sets are wonderfully Victorian, and the identities of the potential Limehouse Golem are all taken from real life with the exception of John Cree (Sam Reid), who makes appearances in flashback sequences after the revelation of his death at the beginning of the story. There's even a connection made to the historical Ratcliff Highway Murders of seventy years prior, a pair of attacks on two separate families resulting in seven fatalities in 1811 London (the details of which were not referenced in the story).The mention of Karl Marx (Henry Goodman) as a murder suspect was particularly compelling if not amusing, given his notoriety as a philosopher and revolutionary socialist. Dan Leno (Douglas Booth), in fact, was a leading music hall comedian and actor of the era, while George Gissing (Morgan Watkins) was a prolific English novelist. Introducing these real life figures into the plot of a murder mystery was rather clever, each given an opportunity to be seen as the Limehouse Golem in action before the eventual reveal.The film does skirt the horror genre to a degree, with gruesome images of mutilated bodies that guide detective John Kildare (Bill Nighy) onto the trail of his quarry, even as the prime suspect is the only one we ever need to care about. Lizzie Cree (Olivia Cooke), for all of her innocence, troubled background and proper behavior, evokes a sympathetic response from the viewer until the final sequence of reenactments testifies to her identity as the title character."
" An ok watch but very predictable
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,6,"I did enjoy this movie but it did have fo many flaws that stopped it from being a great movie. The whole serial killer in a London thing was very much a Jack The Ripper rip off. Prositutes meeting gruesome deaths, bodies being cut up etc etc. I predicted the killer after 5 mins and as the movie went on it became more and more obvious. The ending was also very confusing I thought. Nighy's performance was very flat as if he were going through the motions. Saying that though as a period peace it looked great and I did not feel bored or like I had wasted my time. A good watch."
" Horrible story, very predictable.
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,1,"Sigh. This has to be the worst movie I've ever watched. The movie tries so hard to be a creepy and intriguing horror/thriller, but fails. Waste of time."
" Jack The Theater Goer!
",2019-02-21 00:00:00,5,"Watched this one on a whim, as I hadn't ever heard of it before. A solid cast and hopefulness for a killer golem helped me pick it. Yet, sadly no actual golem just a fancy name for a murderer.I admit that this one was a bit better then I expected, but there was something missing from it that kept it from greatness. The casting was fine, and I did enjoy the time period of this. The Limehouse Golem is just too predictable to like. I feel like if you have seen any Jack the Ripper ripoff movie then you've experienced everything this has to offer. It doesn't help that the investigation only worked with the movie constantly dipping into flashbacks, even though you pretty much know who the killer is very early into the film. It makes the movie seem longer than it is, and wastes some solid performances.I do wonder how The Limehouse Golem would have turned out if they had used a different structure for the film. Maybe the viewers knowing who the murderer is right from the get-go, but watching their dastardly plan play out through the wonderful theater performances that already existed in the film. Sure it stops being a mystery, but then the movie could have played up the more entertaining parts and made it all like a bizarre performance. I think that would have worked better for me. Same movie, just done chronologically sans flashbacks.Still, this movie is worth a watch if you're into the time period and like a well-acted crime drama. Don't expect a mystery because this one is a bit too easily solved."
" Late to the party on this
",2019-02-13 00:00:00,6,"But I enjoyed it. It has quite a lot of flaws, and this is shown in the fact that it was in development for years, but the final product is good and deserves to be seen by more people over here."
" worth a watch

" When crime brings you fame and glory
",2018-11-21 00:00:00,10,"The film starts the way it ends, or nearly that is to say at the end of it and yet it fools you around. Everyone in this small group of music hall people can be the Limehouse Golem, every man and every woman, even those who were killed by the Limehouse Golem. It is mixed up and gothic with tremendous gusto and bravado. And you will fall into the trap and you will be fooled like a poor idiot you are.The Scotland Yard inspector is not young. He is old and experienced and yet he sees nothing, not even what is under his own nose in the British Library. The story is so well set up by the murderer and so well disguised by the stage director of this real-life drama that everyone falls for it and is ready to accuser anyone except the real culprit. It is so easy to accuse someone who is not the criminal they are looking for, but an easy prey that will play the game of the falsely accused victim with so much truth and force since he or she is not the real culprit. But policemen do not believe denials from accused criminals, even if they are not criminals and are accused falsely.Then the rest is just dresses, costumes, settings and dirt galore in the streets and old shops and old houses and even old ways of speaking and you have it all there in front of you. A myth, a thriller before the proper time, the sensational popular novel typical of the 19th century displayed on the screen with enthusiasm and pleasure. And you will enjoy it. But do not drink anything offered by any one of the members of the crew. There is a poisoner among them.So to conclude, that's a brilliant scary and disheartening beautiful crime story with so many crimes that you will turn into a vampire before it is finished.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU"
" Possibly the year's most unexpected treat
",2018-11-01 00:00:00,8,"Possibly the year's most unexpected treat; a visually gorgeous and hugely imaginative screen version of Peter Ackroyd's novel, ""The Limehouse Golem"" is only director Juan Carlos Medina's second film and is something of a triumph in all departments, mixing as it does fact with fiction to brilliant effect. Told almost entirely in flashback, it tells two parallel stories as Inspector Kildare, (a superb Bill Nighy), investigates the murders perpetrated by the Jack-the-Ripper like 'Limehouse Golem' while attempting to prove the innocence of Lizzie Cree, (the excellent Olivia Cooke), on trial for the murder of her husband who also happened to be one of the suspects in the Golem murders. Other suspects include Karl Marx and the Music Hall comic Dan Leno, (Douglas Booth).Of course, the real stars of the picture are Cinematographer Simon Dennis and Production Designer Grant Montgomery who give the film its distinctive look, (like the best Hammer movies and then some), while Medina milks it for all its worth, helped by his very talented cast and such little throwaway touches as making, not only Inspector Kildare gay but also his constable as well, (the always excellent Daniel Mays). Obviously aimed at the multiplex but maybe just a little too smart for mass consumption."
" Fantastic
",2018-10-26 00:00:00,10,"If you like things with mystery and are fan of such things like Sherlock Holmes and Victorian drama/mystery/murder then this is a must on you watch list!I absolutely loved the cast, the story and the way the direct shot the film.10/10 from me!!"
" Entirely predictable but very well executed
",2018-10-23 00:00:00,7,"The story itself was straightforward, but where the film excels is scene setting.One feels transported back to the time, you can almost smell the dank.A thoroughly enjoyable, highly competent. well acted albeit predictable film with a real flair in execution."
" A good film overall
",2018-10-15 00:00:00,7,"This movie certainly was a bit different than most murder mysteries, and unfortunately that's why I'd say it misses 3 starts. There is a lot of time spent on back story for one character rather than actual investigating the possible murders. Personally I'd like it if they kept the guesses coming more than they did, rather than focus on like 2 people as the movie unfolded. Having said that it was a good movie with an ending I didn't see coming, so if you're looking for a good murder mystery, definitely give it a watch"
" Wonderful Victorian era mystery! Great job!
",2018-10-06 00:00:00,8,"Well made;well acted : I loved the bits of live theatre, they showed and how FUN it must been for the poor inhabitants of that dark dreary dreamy and violent London for the great unwashed who did ALL the heavy lifting( at least while the gin kept them warm). I enjoyed this film. Im a lazy type history lover and would love to talk to a kid from 1889 and see what they would make of the world now.LOL AT LEAST IN THE 1890s YOU DIDNT HAVE DNA lucky killers had to be really unlucky cuz even prints werent in use yet...or just starting. Crimes really arent complex( in reality your spouse did it like 98% of the time) And THEN it was the age of discovery science & exploration of the world nearly complete except for that Arctic. So any film the English do on the era has to get that hue of dark green and red JUST right, oh & the way the sets all look like like hoarders from dustmite heaven. And this film DOES it well. But I loved all the actors and the sets and the wonderful mystery. A great rainy-Sunday-in-fall kinda film....well done all. I love seeing the great actor as the Bobbie from SY sorry I dont know anyone's names. They do make great films in England still! At least they have plots and realism. Extra points for no US actors! 😊"
" Unexpectedly good
",2018-10-06 00:00:00,8,"Absolutely loved the flashbacks and the way it was all put together. All of the actors did truly amazing jobs, properly enjoyed watching them perform. So unexpected, don't give up if it's boring you. Do watch the end, it's fab"
" Wait...so...was it her or him or both?!
",2018-09-16 00:00:00,7,"This was a good film. It really caught the mood of the times and Douglas Booth and Olivia Cooke are great in this. Olivia Cooke looks like a young Rose Byrne. I'd only seen Douglas Booth in teen movies or in small roles. This movie really let him shine and he was surprisingly not just a pretty face. He had quite the range in this film. The only issues I had with this film are the gore and the demon-like talking every time Bill Nighy interviewed someone. After awhile it was really off putting. AND then there's the whole matter of the ambiguous ending. I went online afterwards seeking answers and turns out there is no definitive explanation. There are lots of theories but not one article was able to state that the ending was ""such and so"". It was more like ""So in the end it was her BUT it could've been him or it could've been the two of them in on it together."" I'm like okaaay...thanks? I wish the writers or directors had a section on this site for a synopsis of their movies with spoilers. There are too many movies that end ambiguously and that's just frustrating. If they had a section where the people involved with the film gave an explanation of their films - it would help a whole lot of people sleep better at night. I think I'm doomed to never know what the ending is on this film. Grrrr!!!"
" A joy.
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,8,"I found myself entranced and absorbed within seconds of the start of this film, and stayed so throughout. I simply don't understand the low ratings some people have given it. Bags of atmosphere, and superb performances from all concerned. Perhaps it hasn't quite found the right audience, maybe it's not mainstream enough for some, but it hit the mark for me. Recommended."
" The Limehouse Golem resembles a classic gothic murder mystery but less malleable than clay.
",2018-09-01 00:00:00,6,"Period mysteries set in 19th century London are rather frequent. The era of Sherlock Holmes, ""Jack the Ripper"" and a plethora of unsolved crimes. Its own gothicism remains an attractive aesthetic quality that has managed to create its own niche. For the most part, this mystery remains captivating, although extensively formulaic. An inspector is tasked with investigating ""The Limehouse Golem"" whilst simultaneously proving the innocence of a widow accused of murdering her husband. What really worked was the atmosphere. Gloomy, dark and ominous, 19th Century London has never looked so authentically dirty. The contrast of the blackened urban streets to the flamboyant music hall ensures that two tones were nested within the production. Cree's backstory and the inspector's investigation may initially look like separate stories, but as with all these mysteries, slowly start intertwining. The major issue with this, is that the plot is overcooked. Various culprits are accused, investigated and dismissed, however the plot's focus constantly shifts between the two stories mentioned above that you start to question what the main mystery actually is. Is it her innocence? Or the serial killer? The narrative tries to express the importance of both, but this ultimately fails due to the lack of focus and ludicrous amount of explanation, culminating to an underwhelming twist. To be fair, I guessed incorrectly, but I should've known! Fortunately a cast of fresh faces and experienced actors convey a methodical script that felt reminiscent to an Arthur Conan Doyle novel. Plenty of flair and finesse within each line, plus Nighy is a national treasure. Each murder that takes place is soaked in blood and brutality, more so than I expected! The question this film does raise is the pronunciation of ""golem"". I've always thought to it to be ""gol-lum"", not ""go-lem""? Anyway, I digress. A murder mystery relishing in its own classicism, but lacking the focus to elevate it above the rest."
" An enjoyable, blood thirsty murder mystery.
",2018-08-30 00:00:00,7,"The Limehouse Golem is a hugely atmospheric, gothic murder mystery. It is visually stunning, blood thirsty and enthralling. I enjoyed from start to finish, even if I couldn't always follow the plot at times. This is a film I think I will enjoy much more on subsequent viewings as I'll be able to take more in, and discover the small details I missed first time round. Stunning sets, glorious costumes, it really is a visual treat, they managed to capture the spirit of the Ripper's London. It felt like a film version of Ripper Street meets Sherlock. Fabulous performances, Billy Nighy, Olivia Cooke and Sam Reid all excellent, but the star of the show had to be Douglas Booth, who was simply tremendous.Deserving of a higher rating here, and a higher status, this is a quality film. 7/10"
" intriguing mystery
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,7,"It's 1880 London. A series of gruesome murders remains unsolved. Scotland Yard's John Kildare (Bill Nighy) reluctantly takes the case of The Limehouse Golem. He knows that he's expandable in the glare of the media. He takes on constable George Flood as his assistant. George had just arrested Lizzie Cree (Olivia Cooke) for the murder of her struggling playwright husband. She pleads innocent despite damning testimony from the maid. She's a music hall darling after befriending famous performer Dan Leno (Douglas Booth) who becomes her main supporter. Kildare finds a clue which connects to Lizzie's husband.This has a good Victorian darkness. The murder mystery is fairly intriguing. I suspected the final twist but it never gets great foreshadowing. This actually needs Lizzie to be played as two different characters. A little amount of doubt in her innocence would have helped a great deal. While I don't think the twist comes out of nowhere, I also don't think it's completely set up right. The final twist also left me wondering why Kildare refuses to accept the confession. I need him to explain it even if it's in a voiceover. Overall, I find the mystery engrossing although the finale needs a few tweaks."
" Decent but predictable
",2018-08-16 00:00:00,6,Entertaining but ultimately predictable whodunnit. Well acted aside from Nighy who does what you'd expect him to do. Meh
" I absolutely loved this
",2018-08-14 00:00:00,10,"Maybe it's because I love this style, but I absolutely loved this. It's well-written, visually stunning, great acting, and a great murder mystery set in dark Victorian London. What's not to like?"
" Boring beyond belief
",2018-08-05 00:00:00,2,"This was an awful film. So boring! It was 90 minutes too long. The music hall songs reminded me of a tv programme from the 70s called the good old days, It was so obvious who the killer was!"
" Hidden Gem
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,7,"A real pleasant surprise of a film, although it's relatovely low reviews and mixed publicity might suggest one thing reality is in fact very different. Structured in a way that resembles the work of Tarantino in the dawn of his career Limehouse follows Inspectir Kildare (Bill Nighy) on the course of a manhunt for the illusive serial killer preying upon the streets of London, over the course of the film we establish and eliminate suspects, outcomes and narratives that exist in this claustrophobic reality. Through innovative techniques the audience is left guessing whom is responsible for the slayings with every possibility seeming potentially 'real' comes a shock twist which for those who have a love for the genre might find a little predictable, aside from that however it's a tense and fun story that quickly unravels definitely worth a watch"
" unexpectedly good movie
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,7,"This was a movie that reminded me a bit of from hell with johny depp and also Penny dreadful. It was solid, well executed. The problem is the the plot is obvious from the beginning. A person who has watched this type or movies, knows what to expect. I can't recall it right now, but I am sure I have seen the same plot again in another movie but without the victorian london background. 
Nevertheless, the movie is interesting. It has some gruesome murders but it does not show them in a way that your stomach would turn. Because if it did, it would have been a horror movie, unbearable to watch. 
So luckily it avoided that.
The cast was good, I only have objections about Elizabeth Cree. if they could cast another actress ,the whole role concept would enter another level. She is so unbearable and antipathetic that you actually wish for her to hang from the beginning."
" Bore fest
",2018-07-22 00:00:00,2,"Battled to keep my eyes open. One of the most boring movies ive ever seen. The costumes were great, camera and lighting was very good as well, but i could not handle long scenes of nothingness that just keeps going in circles"
" Not very surprising
",2018-07-14 00:00:00,4,"Called the ending within the first 15 minutes.Overall it was decent enough, however if you watch murder mysteries any bit normally than you will easily be able to guess the killer from very early on in the movie. Acting was good."
" Style over substance.
",2018-07-13 00:00:00,7,"This film is exquisitely well-made, with fantastic Production Design (sets) and highly stylised and theatrical Cinematography (lighting) that together create one of the most eerie and evocative visions of Victorian London that I've seen, being somehow both realistic and dreamlike in equal measure.The wardrobe is also of unusually fine quality, with not a single garment seeming to have originated at Angel's Costumers (though doubtless some did), as no part of this film looked or felt like a BBC costume-drama.The music was also fittingly atmospheric, and I'm assuming kept itself appropriately in the background, as I can't seem to hear any of it echoing in my brain minutes after seeing the film, despite having been drawn-in while watching.So technically it didn't disappoint. But sadly that's where my praise must end.I found the screenplay to be an undisciplined mess. The dialogue was alright, per se, but it was as heavy-handed as the plotting, which I assume is a hangover from the original novel, and the structuring was all over the place. It felt like the editor was having a hard time cutting the film, and I imagine a lot of that was due to the unnecessary ponderousness of the script.There needed to be much tighter writing and editing for this film to work, either in terms of entertainment or as a mystery. (I fully and accurately anticipated the ending within 20 minutes of the film starting - as did most of the reviewers on Netflix, from what I've just been reading!)The weak script, and also weak Direction, trickled down to the performances of the talented cast, who in the absence of a strong directorial hand, either over-played or under-played their roles, making the net result uneven and occasionally amateurish.But despite its many flaws, as one Netflix reviewer pointed out, ""It's better than 'From Hell' starring Johnny Depp!"""
" Beautiful cinematography.
",2018-07-12 00:00:00,7,"MORE REVIEWS AT booksequalhappiness.blogspot.comREVIEW: 
I found the cinematography creepy, gruesome, dark, and amazing. It reminded me of Sweeney Todd.Plot-wise, it wasn't awesome but it was alright. I think something doesn't quite match the synopsis that was given though.The pacing was quite slow so it got kind of boring. Still, I was intrigued as to how things would unfold. I really didn't expect the twist to come or maybe I really didn't think that there would be one.I like the short musical parts. It kind of reminded me of Sweeney Todd and Les Miserables.The cast was amazing in their performances especially Douglas Booth as Leno. I love him and his scenes. It was weird but really amazing.SHOULD YOU WATCH IT: Sure, if you want something mysterious and dark (but does have a bit of a slow pacing).
WOULD I WATCH IT AGAIN: Probably not unless someone invited me to watch it with them."
" There will be blood and some guts...
",2018-07-04 00:00:00,9,"The Limehouse Golem is a startling and successful film adaptation of the 1994 Peter Ackroyd novel, 'Dan Leno & The Limehouse Golem'; a murder mystery framed within a story featuring real historical characters - Dan Leno of course, but Marx, played brilliantly if briefly, by Henry Goodman. George Gissing is depicted, and it is set in an authentic seeming recreation of Victorian London. It has Olivia Cooke, a startlingly good actress who is new to me, Nicholas Wooderson, Bill Nighy - a superb performance as John Kildare, an investigating 'detective' before there were such people - and Eddie Marsans; all reliably good; Douglas Booth plays Dan Leno with conviction, another actor new to me. Clive Russell playing a small role as a jailor, does so with his usual distinction. But it is Olivia Cooke who shines in her central role with Nighy; she can be fierce and powerful while seeming to appear utterly still, and her scenes with the great Nigh are not eclipsed by him. The script is superb, written by Jane Goldman, and I wonder if there was any collaboration with the book's writer? It is certainly an exciting adaptation of a great novel. It was outstandingly directed by Juan Carlos Medina, who is another 'unknown' to me."
" A Victorian murder mystery
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,9,"Set in Victorian London, before Jack the Ripper, this film opens with Lizzie Cree being arrested for the poisoning of her husband John. We then learn that a killer has been terrorising the inhabitants of the Limehouse area of the city; a killer that has been dubbed The Limehouse Golem. Inspector John Kildare is given the job of catching the killer after many murders; he knows he is being set upto fail as the previous inspector distances himself from the failed investigation. Kildare works with Constable George Flood, the policeman who arrested Lizzie. An early clue leads to four suspects; one of whom is John Cree. After meeting her in prison, Kildare speculates Lizzie discovered the truth about her husband so killed him but she continues to deny she did it... he determines to identify the Golem and save Lizzie from the noose. Through a series of flashbacks we learn about Lizzie's life; from a child growing up in terrible circumstances to becoming a success in the music hall to marrying John Cree. Other suspects include Dan Leno, a music hall comic; Karl Marx, yes that Karl Marx! and George Gissing, an author. As Kildare closes in on the killer pressure increases as it looks as though Lizzie is sure to hang... if he can prove she killed the Golem he believes the public and the law would forgive her.I was surprised to see this film getting such a low rating here on the IMDb and even more surprised at how few reviews there were. I really enjoyed the story and the way it was told. The story of Lizzie's life was nicely intertwined with the story of the Golem murders and Kildare's investigation. The film has a great look; nicely capturing the traditional representation of Victorian London... the subject of the film also mirrors the Victorian popularity with violent melodrama. When Kildare questions each of the various suspects we see the Golem's crimes with the suspect taking the role of the killer; I rather liked this device as it helped one avoid zeroing on one person as the killer even as more and more evidence pointed to one man. The ending came as a bit of a surprise but proved most satisfactory to me. The cast does a fine job; most obviously Bill Nighy is on fine form as Kildare and I really enjoyed Olivia Cooke's performance as Lizzie. Daniel Mays and Douglas Booth are also impressive as Flood and Dan Leno. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody looking for a murder mystery that feels a little different to most in the genre."
" Dreary and Slow
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,5,"Here we have a Ripper style murder in Victorian London. It is high profile and the public and press are clamouring for results. So what do the police do - they put a washed up detective on the case with the help of a single constable. Compare this to what really happened with the Ripper where the best detectives and an army of police were thrown at the case by the Government of the day and you can already see the plot of this film is not believable.We keep getting hints that the detective is Gay (which is absolutely nothing to do with the plot) and a couple of people express some very modern sensibilities about this (which is nothing to do with the era in which it is set). There might also be a feminist message in here somewhere.The detective wanders about and chats to a few people without any sense of urgency which would be needed to save the ""innocent"" woman who might be hanged for poisoning her husband.In the end I couldn't feel any sympathy for the detective or the women. I just didn't care.BTW: The end is a little silly."
" Well worth a watch
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,7,"I found this film to be very entertaining. Good use of story telling, putting everyone who is under suspicion of being the Golem in the killers shoes as the story unfolds. Definitely worth a watch :)"
" Just wrong
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,5,"The stilted acting, over the top accents, the silly cheap technique of imagining every suspect as the murderer with a digital audio effect to make their voice sound monstrous. 
Bill Nighy brings absolutely nothing to the role, and is robotic and characterless, his side kick policeman is slightly more interesting but has some weird unnecessary dialog. 
Its as though someone writing the stilted pointless dialog of a marvel super hero - has decided to have a go at writing a BBC style period who-dun-it. But has completely failed to work out what that requires apart from throwing some murders and some suspects at the screen."
" Not what I expected, unfortunately
",2018-06-29 00:00:00,4,"THE LIMEHOUSE GOLEM is a Victorian murder mystery based on the novel of the same title by respected British historian Peter Ackroyd. The screenplay was by Jane Goldman, who has recently made quite a career for herself with such diverse pictures as KICK-ASS and KINGSMAN, although it does feel like she's bitten off more than she can chew this time around. The film is advertised as a gruesome detective story in which Bill Nighy (in a role intended for the late Alan Rickman) locks horns with the creature of Jewish myth, but instead it turns out to be some convoluted character story involving street theatres and a woman on trial for poisoning her employer. I was hoping for something like FROM HELL, but this non-supernatural story turns out to be a real bore; it cheats the viewer constantly with fake flashbacks building to an impossible twist ending, and most of the dialogue is lumpy exposition. Nighy has little to do here, and established performers like Eddie Marsan and Nicholas Woodeson even less. I wasn't particularly convinced by Olivia Cooke in her role, and there's too much tawdry social stuff instead of the rollicking, gruesome fun you want to see. It doesn't help that the inexperienced director manages to create a film as bland-looking as they come. Even TV's RIPPER STREET is better than this."
" But where was the golem?...
",2018-06-09 00:00:00,6,"The story told in this movie was a little bit confusing, and at times I was sort of lost as to whom was really the killer, which I suppose was a good achievement on the writers account. But it was just a tad too confusing and wobbly for me.The acting in the movie was phenomenal, and the cast ensemble had some really impressive names with amazing performances. There were some pretty nice performances by Bill Nighy and Olivia Cooke in particular.The setting of ""The Limehouse Golem"" and the atmosphere was simply amazing, which really helped to bring the movie to life on the screen. They really managed to capture the atmosphere of the era quite nicely, both in costumes, speech, props and sets.The movie felt a bit too long perhaps, because the storyline was a bit too rambling for my personal preference. Plus I had no idea what the movie was about prior to sitting down to watch it, and with the word golem in the title I had expected something more in the likes of ""Frankenstein"".However, all in all, ""The Limehouse Golem"" was an entertaining movie, especially if you enjoy movies that does not present the storyline on a platter and where you have to keep an alert eye and be aware of all that is going on."
" Mystry, A Good One
",2018-05-20 00:00:00,7,"Main actress, she acts awesome, well costume design is awesome too, they really know what to do. Good actors/actresses and good screenplay, well all things are good, and i enjoy this movie. All i can say is if you like a Mystry, Thriller, a little Horror film, go and watch this one. Your vote will be 10 for this kind of movie.
Usually we wont see these kind of movies, maybe 2 or 3 in a year. Here the dialogues were fast and long, sometimes i need to rewatch. Cause they want to find the killer, and if you miss it, you wont understand why him/her. So i tell it is better if there is not any popcorn near you, lol. Just focus on film and find more fun.
Another points i like to talk about, are roles. Here there is theater where people play roles to laugh viewers. So the one whom knows how to act on stage, can acts like a killer too. I really interested when see this idea inside this movie. I hope everyone enjoy this movie like me. 
Have fun..."
" Another Compelling Production From Great Britain
",2018-05-09 00:00:00,7,"This was not a perfect movie by any means. The pacing was stilted, the story, while interesting, had too many distractions to be compared to other great British police dramas. I would give it 5/10 for story and direction. But what won me over, was the absolutely stellar performances by the always wonderful Bill Nighy, Olivia Cooke and Douglas Booth. I kept wondering where I had seen Olivia Cooke before. I looked her up (in here) and she played one of my favorite characters on Bates Motel, Emma Decody. In this movie, she definitely shares some of the screen with Douglas Booth (Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, Jupiter Ascending). However, her energy and her immersion into the character of Lizzie Cree, was simply spectacular to watch. I loved her in Bates Motel. But here, I didn't recognize her so much had she disappeared into Lizzie Cree. Douglas Booth also shines in this somewhat average film. Bill Nighy, a great British actor for many decades, all but disappears as the detective investigating the case, as Ms. Cooke and Mr. Booth seem to own their parts. I could not give this film any more than 7/10 because it didn't earn any more as a story and as a production. But Olivia Cooke and Douglas Booth managed to mesmerize me into watching and enjoying this movie very much. *****SPOILER ALERT***** I cannot help but think that the name Lizzie Cree was a bow to the Lizzie Borden story, considering how it ended. I say watch it for the performances, and the ending is a bit of a twist which was also quite stunning and I did not see it coming! I think you will at least be entertained and that is the point of the whole acting, TV, and film industry anyway."
" Decent murder mystery
",2018-05-08 00:00:00,7,"A series of savage murders in Victorian Limehouse results in the killer being dubbed The Limehouse Golem. Inspector Kildare is put on the case but, given his suspected homosexuality which has caused his career to falter, he is intended to be a scapegoat given the expected failure of the investigation. The suspects include Karl Marx, theatrical star Dan Leno, and John Cree, a dead newspaper reporter whose wife is on trial for his murder. Kildare begins to believe that Cree is the Golem, and his investigative efforts turn towards trying to prove Lizzie Cree's innocence.The title of this period shocker leads you to think it's a monster movie, but it isn't. It's a suspense drama with violent moments, and it has an ambience which is reminiscent of the better Hammer horrors of the 60s and 70s. I wouldn't say it's a horror film, though.The period feel is good, Bill Nighy is reliably superb as Kildare, Olivia Cooke shines as Lizzie, and the supporting cast are all fine.If I have a criticism, it is that the plot thread of Kildare's alleged homosexuality is included to justify Scotland Yard's attitude towards him, referred to obliquely towards the end, but otherwise not taken anywhere. It could have been used to illuminate his character, to explain his sympathetic attitude towards Lizzie and, thereby, to have become a more organic part of the story: as it was, it felt like no more than a not particularly well-used plot device.Even so, the strength here was the story. Jane Goldman scripts from a novel by Peter Ackroyd and, while the story always feels predictable, it never quite is. I enjoyed the fact that I often thought I knew where it was going to go, then found out I was wrong."
" Can somebody please explain the last 90 seconds?
",2018-04-20 00:00:00,8,"I am apparently too stupid to understand the final final plot twist - does anyone? After Lizzie has gone to the gallows and Inspector Kildare has received his well deserved promotion, Dan Leno puts on a show based on Lizzie's life, starting with her hanging. In this show her character is played by her erstwhile nemesis and sometimes maid/substitute in her husband's bed, Aveline. The stage gallows, previously shown to be harmless to whoever gets ""hanged"", malfunctions and Aveline is killed. Dan then says he'll play Lizzie and puts on a Lizzie wig. In the next shot, however, it is Lizzie herself, not Dan, who's on the stage taking in the audience's applause and adulation. So - are we to conclude that she somehow escaped from prison, manipulated the stage gallows to kill Aveline and take over her role? Or is this just a fantasy? (If so, whose?) I am confused."
" A repetitive snoozefest
",2018-04-14 00:00:00,3,Based on some theatrical circle circlejerk. Definitely not the director's strongest movie. The characters are uninteresting and too egotistical to be even remotely engaging.

" The 19th century murder mysteries!
",2018-02-04 00:00:00,6,"Based on the book of the same name. The late 1800s murder mystery, revolving around a young woman and an old cop who is investigating a series of murders. Elizabeth Cree had not had a best childhood, but she almost reached to her dream to become a best actress in the town. Then suddenly a murder jeopardise everything she had worked so hard. Now she has to cooperate with a detective to come out of the mess. But the tale takes a twist at every corner, making more complication for her freedom. How this puzzle is solved was told with a final twist that flips the whole scenario upside down.First of all, I love such costume drama. The atmosphere was awesome. Well maintained suspense, along with a good pace of the story narration. From all it's the actors, especially for me, it's the Olivia Cooke. Bill Nighy was not bad too. Despite he's one of the main character, Cooke stole the show. But the film was not a masterpiece. From an entertainment perspective, it delivered. I think it was a good adaptation. The only weak point is, most people would guess the end twist. It was intentional. But overall film was decent.6/10"
" London's always going to look spooky, isn't it?
",2018-01-18 00:00:00,8,"I was surprised to learn that ""The Limehouse Golem"" is based on a novel, but it is. It's an intense movie, as Bill Nighy's detective tries to put together evidence to figure out who's been committing a series of murders in Victorian London. A surprise is the depiction of Karl Marx. You wouldn't expect the author of ""The Communist Manifesto"" to appear as a character in a movie about Jack the Ripper-style killings, but here he is (however, the Marxists will be disappointed to hear that he appears only as a supporting character and doesn't make any profound speeches).Overall, I recommend the movie. It makes London look like one eerie place, even the local theater. The rest of the cast includes Olivia Cooke, Douglas Booth and Eddie Marsan.**The same day that I saw this, I also saw ""Their Finest"", in which Bill Nighy and Eddie Marsan co-star."

Had it been categorised as a Drama movie, I wouldn't have watched the movie. Anyway I watched this movie and definitely not disappointed by this movie. I expected much blood and horror in this movie. But I found very little in this movie. This movie is indeed slow paced, but the clever plot and the twist ending compensate the shortfall of this movie. Since I am a fan of period movies, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie in that aspect. Atmosphere and costumes are utterly flawless. Acting is good. This movie is a real treat for mystery fans."
" The Good Old Days With A Serial Killer.
",2017-12-05 00:00:00,8,Horror/Serial Killer film with some Fortean touches. 70 years after a mass killing it looks as if the killer is back again. One of his new victims is a Jewish scholar and the murderer leaves a memento on a book page which has a drawing of a Golem. The Scotland Yard DI (Bill Nighy) who is being set up to fail reckons the killer is all too human and looks at suspects who include Karl Marx and George Gissing. All of them had used the British Museums Reading Room on a certain day.The film is set against the background of a Limehouse Music Hall whose star (Olivia Cooke) is being tried for murdering her husband (who is suspected of being the Golem). Real life Musical Hall singer and comedian of the time Dan Leo also figures in the tale.
" Dilemma
",2017-12-03 00:00:00,8,"The story of The Limehouse Golem was indeed well-written. I started to watch the movie with low expectations, since I don't particularly enjoy stories that take place in previous centuries. The beginning was a bit confusing, but as the story unfolded, I realized it is much better than what I expected!The overall experience was pretty well, and it kept my mind occupied for a few hours afterwards. The acting was great, the story didn't have any visible flaws, and there was enough suspense/mystery to keep me watching. The story isn't exceptionally original, but I didn't mind it at all. The reactions and consequences were believe- able, and you wouldn't feel that the characters are morons! (this happens a lot in many movies these days)I would strongly recommend giving this movie a go! Hope you enjoy it as much as I did."

" These films that in the end begin to explain
",2017-11-05 00:00:00,3,"The film promised a lot, what a pity it stays in that. Watching the trailer you want to see it and you are watching it and you like it, the problem is that it does not manage to maintain tension and the last third begins to explain the whole movie and then it destroys it.It is very well set, you enter full in that historical moment. Both the decorations, as the makeup, the hairdressing, are great. I love watching these movies because of how well they do these things. Pity the rest.The actors are very well almost all, I do not like neither Bill Nighy nor Douglas Booth, they have given a role too good person.The photography is spectacular. How it gets you into the story.The direction that seemed to go well in telling the story, in the end, treats the viewer badly and explains everything. He does not know how to count on the camera.It is a small disappointment"

Then it will be surprising, for the rest, it really is painful to watch as the movie dances around the obvious.Again, everything else was good, the setting and the way it played out like a play while everyone was literally playacting was nice and different to other movies. worth a watch, just don't expect to be surprised."
" first half amazing... last half sucks
",2017-10-27 00:00:00,7,The first half of this movie runs fast and there's a lot going on. There's a great and original sense of atmosphere.Then in the second half it fails badly. The male and female lead suspects are blurred together in this very thin plot device about a biographical play. It's not very believable. That the girl is in fact the killer is signposted very very early.Watch the first half. Pity about the rest.
" Sensitive inspector solves serial murders in Victorian London slums
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,8,"This post-modern, self-reflexive horror film is about the audience's hunger for horror. The opening scene introduces the film's story as a music hall performance, announced by the period comedian Dan Leno. Later Inspector Kildare speaks of the public's craving for sensationalism, for gore, which the plot generously provides. The rabid press embodies the public's craving for the horrific.When Leno states he will start the story at the end, a strategy repeated in the later staging of the monster's supposed demise, he implicitly roots the story in our time. The film like its plot moves back in time. Several modern themes are woven back into the Victorian fiction: Kildare's career freeze due to his suspected homosexuality (""He's not the marrying kind"") and his aide's later implication; the sexual fluidity in Leno's and in heroine Lizzie's theatrical acts; the psychological damage done by early poverty and abuse; the latent antisemitism in British culture; the mobilization as suspects of well-known historical figures Leno, George Gissing and Karl Marx; Lizzie's feminist ambitions and values, especially as she turns her marriage into a theatrical staging with radical inflections of the usual husband and wife roles. in fact, the running theme of characters playing roles, ""performing"" rather than ""being,"" in life as on stage, may be the film's central motif. The theatrical characters are always posing, and for all their pretence to family often ""plotting"" against each other. The line between reality and fiction deliberately blurs when the so-called Golem's bloody murders are replayed with each suspect cast in turn as the killer. Here possibility is played out as actual occurrence. The central role of Klldare is significantly given to Bill Nighy, an actor primarily known for the comedy of befuddlement. He is as modern a character as his antithesis, the adventurous and rule-breaking Lizzie is. Assigned to solve the Golem murders, he is diverted by his sensitivity to save Lizzie from her charge of killing her husband. He recovers his dashed reputation by salvaging her honour.But Kildare destroys the evidence of her wider guilt. He early expresses his confidence that there must be a coherence among all the Limehouse murders, ""the story."" At the end he has, he knows, his story. But its implications are too disturbing, too dangerous, for him to unleash. He prefers to let Lizzie die with her honour restored and the true Golem killer's identity concealed. As the truth has profoundly shocked him, he protects the public from it for the general good. Perhaps that's why his name recalls the popular soap character Dr. Kildare, with its healing functions outweighing any detective role. Simply, Kildare opts not to expose the threat of a rampant Woman. Horrors we may crave, but not one that so challenges our traditional gender politics."
" Spoilers follow ...
",2017-10-11 00:00:00,8,"This is a sumptuous, beautifully produced period horror drama. It reminds me of the kind of carefully crafted historical chillers the BBC sometimes produces for the autumn audience, the like of which receives acceptable ratings against the talent show dross elsewhere on mainstream television, and receives complaints from the cavilling general public for being 'too dark'.I love it: the smoky charnel houses, the rain and waste-strewn cobbles, the dim light, class divides, penny dreadfuls, pox-ridden low-lives, music hall drabs, salty gags, cockney peelers, pea-soupers and the streets of London 'running red with blood.' Dan Leno (Douglas Booth), a kind of Victorian Russell Brand, takes an avuncular interest in young Elizabeth Cree (Olivia Cooke), who is under suspicion for murdering her husband. Inspector John Kildare (Bill Nighy in a role originally taken by the late Alan Rickman) has evidence that her husband may be the legendary murderer 'the Limehouse Golem', and is determined to save Elizabeth from a date with the gallows.There are those who say Bill Nighy only ever plays himself. I think there is truth to this, but when you have cornered the market so brilliantly, why step outside of it? Here, he is exceptional as always as the Inspector, with much support from the excellent Daniel Mays as Constable George Flood. In a small role Damien Thomas (Count Karnstein in Hammer's 1971 'Twins of Evil') plays heavily bearded Soloman Veil. Maria Valverde is wonderful as the arch Aveline Ortega.A terrific twisted, twisty tale admirably directed by Juan Carlos Medina. Well worth your time."
" Surely destined to enjoy cult status in later life
",2017-10-06 00:00:00,7,"The Limehouse Golem, adapted from the novel by Peter Ackroyd, has lingered in development hell for years, being passed between various directors and actors (Alan Rickman pulled out at the last minute due to his failing health), before finally getting the green light in the hands of rookie filmmaker Juan Carlos Medina and screenwriter Jane Goldman. Boasting a terrific cast, a blood-drenched, smog- filled atmosphere, and a murder mystery that is as grisly as it is engaging, the film has sadly struggled to find an audience. With a measly number of ratings just shy of 4,000 on IMDb, its failure is truly unfortunate. The Limehouse Golem is, at its heart, a Sherlock Holmes-esque mystery set in a pre-Jack the Ripper London, complete with a frustrated detective, a handful of red herrings, a small band of colourful suspects. But dig a little deeper, and there's an interesting feminist work at play.Beginning, as charismatic music hall performer Dan Leno (Douglas Booth) announces, at the end, Medina introduces to this eternally grey world with the death-by-poison of wannabe playwright John Cree (Sam Reid). His wife Lizzie (Olivia Cooke) is distraught, but her conniving maid Aveline (Maria Valverde) - whose role in the story becomes clearer through flashbacks - drops the hint to police that Lizzie is the one to make his nightcaps, and insisted on doing so the night the husband she wasn't very fond of died. The beginning, at we come to learn, is more like the middle, as this opening scene not only sets in motion Lizzie's story (she is arrested and faces the noose is found guilty), but may also hold the key to the identity of a brutal killer who has terrified the community of Limehouse with a series of nasty slayings - The Limehouse Golem.We learn of the Golem's activities through John Kildare (Bill Nighy), a disliked Scotland Yard investigator brought in as a scapegoat when previous investigations have led to dead ends. Upright and quietly-spoken, Kildare is known as ""not the marrying type,"" and has therefore found himself dumped in menial department ushered away in some dark corner, despite his obvious skills in the field. To help navigate the filthy slums, he procures the help of highly competent copper George Flood (Daniel Mays). Yet Kildare's hunt for the killer is made even more desperate by the ticking-clock that is Lizzie's trial, and saving her from the gallows becomes as equally important as preventing another murder victim. Man's urge to rescue a 'woman in need' is a prime focus of Medina's film, and Lizzie seems to find one at every turn. A victim of childhood abuse, she is also doted over by Cree, a nice guy on the face of it, but one driven by the need to sweep a girl away from nothing and into his handsome, middle-class arms.Kildare quickly learns that Lizzie doesn't need to be, or even want to be, saved. Nighy may have received top billing, but this is very much Cooke's film. She has the most screen time, and handles Lizzie's development from a strong-willed working-class girl, into a star of the music hall, and eventually into a possible murderer, astonishingly well. As Leno, Booth plays the role like a big-toothed and less annoying version of Russell Brand, and shows remarkable restraint and skill in avoiding stumbling into caricature. But much praise must also be lavished on Medina and Goldman, who both manage to juggle the thrills and intrigue of a Victorian whodunit with a character piece that reveals far more layers than you would expect. When it does delve deeper into the mystery, Medina relishes the squalor, employing different characters to monologue the killer's diary as Kildare lines up the suspects, and delivering some surprisingly gory moments. Surely a film destined to enjoy cult success later in life, The Limehouse Golem is a truly unexpected delight."
" A Ghoulish Portrayal of Victorian London
",2017-10-04 00:00:00,7,"Based on the 1994 novel Dan Leno and the Limehouse Golem by Peter Ackroyd, The Limehouse Golem (2016) is a ghoulish portrayal of a Victorian London slum and the stone-faced detective trying to solve a series of grizzly and sensational crimes. It was directed by Juan Carlos Medina and adapted for the screen by Jane Goldman.Medina is an inexperienced director, having only four films under his belt since 2001, and only two were full-length. Goldman wrote screenplays for The Woman in Black (2012), X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014), and Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014). Her talented script shines through.In the opening act, Lizzie Cree (Olivia Cooke) is arrested on suspicion of poisoning her husband, John (Sam Reid). Meanwhile, Inspector John Kildare (Bill Nighy) is tasked to solve the ""Limehouse Golem"" murders, which have become sensationalized in the press. He enlists the help of a Limehouse bobby George Flood (Daniel Mays).They discover the Golem's diary written on the pages of ""On Murder Considered as one of the Fine Arts"" (1827) by Thomas De Quincey in a library and narrow the suspects to four men: philosopher Karl Marx (Henry Goodman), writer George Gissing (Morgan Watkins), comedian Dan Leno (Douglas Booth), and John Cree.Inspector John Kildare is not an adept detective and even refers to himself as a scapegoat. Focusing almost entirely on handwriting analysis to whittle down a list of four suspects, he misses obvious clues like the fact that no new murders occur after the death of John Cree and the imprisonment of Elizabeth. The Limehouse Golem made it clear he was seeking fame above all else; he would not let someone else take the blame while he quietly slipped away, meaning the murderer had to either be John or Elizabeth.**Major spoiler** In the end, it's revealed that Elizabeth was the Golem all along. Left scarred and unable to enjoy sex by a cruel punishment inflicted by her mother, Elizabeth was raised on the streets until eventually carving out a home at the local theater. John Cree promises to give her the staring role in his new play if she marries him, but the play bombs and he loses interest. Desperate for the crowd's adulation, Elizabeth turns into a monster, crafting her murderous persona around the mythological golem, a creature in Jewish folklore created from mud or clay.This surprise ending doesn't work well because it's so out of left field. There are no indications Elizabeth is capable of the grisly crimes, and it's a historic fact that most female serial killers (rare in and of itself) are poisoners and not brutal killers. Also, if Elizabeth was so desperate for fame and wanted recognition as the Limehouse Golem, why did she wait until just before she was executed to take credit? Why did she bother poisoning her husband and attempt to put the blame on him? That being said, Olivia Cooke, who also played Emma Decody on Bates Motel (2013-2017), was great in the role.The Limehouse Golem is not historic fiction in a sense that the main plot and events really happened, but the setting, crimes, culture, and peripheral characters were largely historical, much like Gangs of New York (2002) colorfully brought to life mid-nineteenth century New York City. Limehouse is a district in east London on the north bank of the River Thames, and has long been an important shipping hub. In Victorian London, Limehouse was a bit Bohemian, with numerous bawdy music halls. It was frequented by well-known performers and intellectual figures, like three of the historic characters in the film: Karl Marx, George Gissing, and Dan Leno.The Limehouse Golem is not without its inaccuracies. The movie is set in 1880 and contains references to concealing homosexuality, public hanging, the age of consent being 16, and a magic trick involving a woman being cut in half. According to Christopher Pittard, a Senior Lecturer in English Literature at the University of Portsmouth, the age of consent in Great Britain was raised to 16 in 1885, homosexuality was not criminalized until 1885, public hangings were abolished in 1868, and no woman was cut in half in a magic trick until 1921. These are relatively minor inaccuracies, but I wonder why the film wasn't just set five years later, since it contains other references to events in 1885 as well.The film criticizes ""white knights,"" men who rush to the aid of vulnerable women, and even uses the anachronistic term. When George Gissing asks Inspector Kildare if he's surprised he married a ""fallen woman,"" Kildare replies contemptuously: ""Why would anyone be surprised? The world is full of men like you, Mr. Gissing. Men who feign generosity when all they really seek is congratulation. Men who play God by saving lives. Is it really so different, I wonder, than playing God by taking them?"" It's a great line, but doesn't make much sense. I think any reasonable person would say saving lives is quite different from taking them, whatever the motive.Overall, The Limehouse Golem has a decent cast, good direction, and great dialog. It rises above the typical police procedural, especially for history buffs, but isn't quite as impactful as its creators intended."
" Barely ripped.
",2017-10-03 00:00:00,6,"THE LIMEHOUSE GOLEMgolem217.jpgBARELY RIPPEDWhile many will revel in the gloriously lush presentation, ""The Limehouse Golem"" plays too much as a clever theatre piece, rather than a peek behind your hands thriller. This would-be serial killer horror film, suffers from endless self-inflicted stylish blows: it is costumed, staged and acted to death. But what a beautiful demise it is.Leave it to Juan Carlos Medina (directing) and the Brits (acting) to bring forth such a grandiose, poetic, cinematic feast. Channeling his best Hammer era Peter Cushing, Bill Nighy as the anxious yet calmly methodical Scotland Yard inspector is exceptional, and almost elevates the film to a level it so deserves. There just isn't enough grit and shock for the series of heinous crimes to get any juice flowing; even the gory corpses are presented as carefully arranged, colourful still lifes. Dialogues are poetic and unspontaneous, simple scenes are meticulously choreographed, sets are lavished, wardrobe is wildly bombastic. It is a wonderfully lush, over the top feast for the senses, that lacks proper plot delivery to create a deserving fog of mystery.There's a nice, rewarding, twisty tale under all that distracting sheen, though it requires much work from the viewer."
" A dark and daring detective drama that's never as straight-forward as it threatens to be.
",2017-09-29 00:00:00,7,"Splattered with surprising amounts of grisly gore, layered with darkly mature themes and brimming with otherwise brutal viscera, this Victorian-era detective drama is a much more nuanced affair than first advertised, playing out not as a simple whodunnit but rather as an exploration of theatre vs reality and the pantomime roles all of the key players (whom are all written and acted wonderfully) inevitably, and perhaps unknowingly, play. While I had successfully figured out the identity of the killer before the second act had even begun, it didn't take anything away from my enjoyment of the picture. All of the pieces were on the board from the beginning and each twist made perfect sense within the narrative; there was no cheating and that alone is to be applauded. In the end, this was a very enjoyable and gripping thriller which was as fun to unravel as it was to passively watch, also working well as a sort of meta-textual commentary. After all, when the audience wants blood, it's blood they will get. 7/10"

" If you are not bored with the Victorian era London, you might enjoy it
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,7,"The movie is a Victorian era murder mystery, with the now obligatory social commentary. As many such films are, it has a mystery, a twist, and the place in between is filled with the wonders and horrors of the past. A little hypocritical from a movie that takes a jibe at the blood thirsty masses.But anyway, we have filthy London, we get a Jackish serial killer and a valiant policeman trying (nay, needing) to solve the case. I don't know who had the idea to put Bill Nighy, a comedic powerhouse, in this role. He performed brilliantly, as he is known to do, but you could have literally put anyone else there and the movie would have been unchanged. The star of the show is, in the movie and for us, Olivia Cooke. She owned the film completely.Now, if by chance you are tired of the depictions of old London, all you have to enjoy in this film are the performances and the peeling of the murder layers. Unfortunately, the twist is pretty transparent from the beginning, so for me the movie was a bore. That doesn't mean it is bad. The acting was great, the sets were OK, the message was important. The problem, I think, was a lack of subtlety in the direction. Everything hits you on the head, like you are a dumb thing that needs to be educated. And when you see it coming a mile away, it just loses any effect and what remains is the dull and rough handling of the story."
" The Serial-Killer
",2017-09-19 00:00:00,6,"""The Limehouse Golem"" is a dark thriller with beautiful art direction and costumes in the Nineteenth Century in London and great performances, highlighting Douglas Booth and Olivia Cooke. Unfortunately the screenplay is pretentious, turning the story of a serial-killer into a complete and deceptive mess. The conclusion, when the elder Scotland Yard Inspector John Kildare finds the true identity of the notorious serial- killer Golem and hides from everybody, is awful. He lets an innocent man be blamed so that the real killer does not become famous. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): Not Available"
" A thoroughly entertaining whodunit in Victorian London
",2017-09-19 00:00:00,9,"I am at a loss as to so many negative reviews at a film that delights, moves along at a great pace, has a fabulous twist, a great cast and is beautifully filmed.There is a bit of gore, but it's not gratuitous or - by today's standards - too graphic. It seems it's fine to have films with death by gun so copious that you lose track of the number of people wiped out, but a handful of people knifed and some blood is a seemingly a no-no for some people.The screenplay is fabulous, some lovely changes in mood between music theatre and macabre while London looks dark and moody in Victorian splendour.Thoroughly recommended; do go and see it while being prepared for a bit of gore along with a rollicking good story!"
" Limehouse Blues
",2017-09-16 00:00:00,5,"If marks were awarded for 'gimmick' element this would be a finalist offering as it does a Victorian time zone, unsubtle nods to Jack The Ripper and a backdrop of Music Hall which was, of course, at its height at the time and for good measure Dan Leno, a real headliner in the Music Hall, is a character in the story. Given ingredients like these even an upside-down cake could hardly fail to rise yet Jane Goldman's screenplay strives for mediocrity and is played for much more than it is worth by the likes of Bill Nighy, Eddie Marsan, Henry Goodman etc.Essentially it's a string of red herrings suspended from a line of clichés albeit it appears to have its champions."
" Not as Clever as It Thinks It Is
",2017-09-15 00:00:00,7,"A father and son are in a car accident. They both are taken to the emergency room. When the boy is taken by stretcher to his emergency operation, the surgeon says, ""I cannot operate because he is my son."" How is this possible? I was reminded of this riddle all throughout watching The Limehouse Golem, an atmospheric and detailed Victorian era mystery. In it, a series of murders have scandalized the east London district that bears the film's name. Inspector Kildare (Nighy) is put on the case partially out of political convenience. ""The public needs fresh blood,"" says the power hungry Inspector Roberts (Sullivan). To whit Kildare is primed to be Scotland Yard's newest scapegoat. As luck would have however, Kildare comes to believe the serial murders are linked to another case – that of a young actress, Lizzie Cree (Cooke); accused of poisoning her husband (Reid). Can the embattled Inspector crack the case before Lizzie is sent to the gallows? Despite having the pedigree of a slightly cheaper Downton Abbey (2010-2015), the atmosphere of Limehouse Golem is surprisingly layered. The squalid city streets, the busy wings of the burlesque, the hallowed halls of the Limehouse Library (really the John Rylands Library in Manchester) all shot with foreboding beauty in mind. Likewise the camera glides seamlessly between scenes of murder and actors weaving macabre recreations of current events. Theater, so it seems, is its own form of alchemy and director Juan Carlos Medina is determined to show off what jewels he can create.Yet while the film does its due diligence to build its case, the main conceit can't help but leave the impassive viewer uninspired. Don't get me wrong, the plot makes sense but this is a police procedural with a capital P. And as with any police procedural, much of the case is spent trying and failing to create a working scenario with a diverse array of suspects based on the clues provided. Depending on your investment you may just be frustrated that Kildare and his lapdog Constable (Mays) aren't barking up a different tree. If however you're old-school flabbergasted by the big third act reveal, chances are you walked into a mystery movie by mistake.So essentially the mystery doesn't live up to its own hype but the good news is the acting definitely does. Bill Nighy and Douglas Booth are fabulous as always with Booth stealing all the best lines as a vaudeville star and Lizzie's effeminate best friend. The real takeaway however is Sam Reid as John Cree the husband who may or may not be the titular bloodthirsty Golem. While remaining a suspect throughout the film's nearly two-hour run time, Reid remains effortlessly charming. He subtly reveals through action that his character has plenty to hide and can play multiple versions of himself (depending on the narrator) with aplomb. Olivia Cooke likewise gives a stunning performance though because she narrates large swaths of the story proper, she isn't given as much an opportunity to show rather than tell.Considering the movie is based on a novel written by Peter Ackroyd, Limehouse could have been far more of a trial than it ended up being. Thankfully Jane Goldman's capable script and Juan Carlos Medina's affecting direction is the one-two punch needed to prevent The Limehouse Golem from being a gloomy trudge through Victorian England. It could have been a better mystery but at least its not as airless as it could have been."
" Grand Guinol theatre in the proper style
",2017-09-14 00:00:00,8,"The Limehouse Golem is a generally good example of the Grand Guinol tradition - an entertaining Victorian Gothic horror cum murder mystery, set in London. Based on the novel of the same title, it tells the story of a series of grisly (seemingly motiveless random) murders which are bookended by an unsuccessful production of a play, and the poisoning of the husband of a popular music hall actress. The play was put on by the wife, and written by the poisoned husband. However, the Limehouse Golem has not been caught, and the investigating detective is under pressure to get results. Anyone familiar with the excellent Ripper Street may wonder what The Limehouse Golem adds to the genre, but there is enough style and substance to deliver a proper filmic experience, rather than a TV feature dressed up as a movie. The best trick it pulls off is to tell the story of the murders and subsequent trial through the eyes of the players and audience of the theatre which is at the heart of the tale. Also, the murders are detailed in flashbacks, as depicted in the killer's confessional graffiti which adorns an unpopular tome in a library; the detective in charge (Bill Nighy) imagines the identity of the murderer changing as he interrogates each suspect in turn. This neat trick keeps us guessing as to who dunnit. The cast are pretty good in their roles, although the dialogue was delivered through the proverbial sock by a number of them. Not Bill Nighy, though - he's a pro who enunciates beautifully. There a few red herrings which are redundant; oddly, though, mostly not to do with the murders. Notably, Bill Nighy's inspector is supposed to have been sidelined for promotion due to suspicions that he is homosexual, which was of course illegal in Victorian Britain. Why is this relevant? Is he gay, and if so, how does it fit with his supposed lack of impartiality regarding the outcome of actress Lizzie Cree's trial for the poisoning of her husband? Does he see in her a chance at redemption by proxy? It's all a bit too deep and distracting from the (ironically) lighter material which makes up the rest of the film. Also, the ending suggests the killer wasn't caught after all, which seems absurd; it feels like a bit of an unnecessary add-on with a righteous sentiment. Having said all that, I genuinely didn't guess who the killer was before the film was good and ready to reveal it, which is the best outcome for any whodunnit. I'm pretty sure I'd enjoy seeing this again, even though I know, which is the other great achievement of a whodunnit."
" ""ewww"" and ""ooooh"" in perfect measures.
",2017-09-13 00:00:00,9,"If you have a yearning for a juicy Gothic murder mystery thriller then I would insist you catch 'The Lime-house Golem' or if you are my dad 'The Lime-house Gollum'. You do get a baptism of fire with the more extreme moments at the start; however the film quickly establishes an effective contrast between the stylistically daring murder scenes and the warm flamboyant theatre antics. There was almost an atmosphere of live-theatre about the film and there where some very exuberant performances; Eddie Marsan and Douglas Booth where particularly entertaining. This film never lets your mind leave the story as the pace is very urgent and captivating and I was very absorbed by the mystery. There is a real Gothic beauty about Lime-house Golem and It does a great job of capturing the atmosphere of a grisly Victorian London. I would have killed (figuratively speaking) for a rummage around the costume department for this film as it has a spectacular use of costume and design and a great command of colour. There was a greenish hue for the scenes that where chillier in tone which clashed effectively with the orange tinted glow of the theatre scenes. Before going to see Lime-house Golem I had read that the identity of the Golem was obvious and this caused me to second guess my instinct and predict wrong. (Thank you critics for your assistance.) I do feel however that whether you guess the ending or not; the reveal was very succulent because it made complete narrative sense and you didn't feel cheated by having a tenuous character be revealed as the murderer. I thought the stories interlaced in a really engaging fashion, and I was going ""ewww"" and ""ooooh"" in satisfying measures."
" A unbiased review
",2017-09-12 00:00:00,5,"I rated this movie 5 because the settings and the costumes as well as the acting of the characters, especially by the actor who played Dan Leno was worth watching. However, I felt like this movie too, just like every other movie these days is trying to emphasize that a woman is capable (both physically and mentally) to do everything that a man generally is well-adept to do, and in this case a cute looking woman butchering people for no apparent reason. Spoiler Alert: The worse thing is the ageing detective falling for a deranged murderer and letting her husband become a scapegoat and making him the culprit of those horrendous crime after his death just because he never respected the institution of marriage and in the process turning the real murderer into a legend. Pathetic! The double standards of feminism is again apparent in the end.."
" gore blimey
",2017-09-12 00:00:00,5,"I went to see this as it starred Bill Nighy,who was very good.However I found the film to be mediocre at best,relentlessly grim and with a penchant to go overboard on the gore.I especially did not like the unnecessary camera movements,arty photography and distorted sound.I was also at a loss to understand the use of the word Golem in the title.I am aware of the silent film,so why didn't they just say Ripper instead."
" Gruesomely fluffy
",2017-09-12 00:00:00,6,"When a successful actress goes on trial in mid-Victorian London for the fatal poisoning of her husband, a struggling detective finds links between the dead man and a series of notorious killings.Lively and stylish period mystery that doesn't really bring all its themes and influences together. The pace cracks along as the narrative switches between courtroom drama, police procedural, and flashbacks. There are a few set pieces involving famous writers from the era, but they're pure diversion, and the Jewish theme seems confused (I guess it had more heft in the novel). And the procedural device of handwriting tests isn't convincing. Greatest dramatic weakness is that, while the music hall atmosphere is well created, the stage performances are just ditties with little thematic or plot substance.I didn't anticipate the reveal, so the whodunit process was fairly enjoyable, but an unnecessary tell at the start of the third act meant there was no surprise. I also didn't get the coda - why? Performances were good, although the lead actress is never a cockney. Favourite was the Spanish actress - would like to see more of her ... Music, photography, sets and editing excellent. Plenty of gore, but not many frights.Overall: Enjoyable fluff."
" Elegant and dark, but ...
",2017-09-12 00:00:00,6,"I mean : really? are you all telling me you didn't notice who's the murderer right from the start? Come on ... even if you let yourself go watching with the best intentions,so the script have a serious flaw in that sense; the rest is pleasant, even the last minutes, when there is no surprise at all about what I said before.On the other hand, the cast is really good.Regards from B.A."
" The Limehouse Golem: A Victorian who-dun-it
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,7,"Story of catching a serial killer. Set in the late 19thC in a dark smoggy Victorian London, this is in the time before Jack the Ripper. This is a murder, mystery, crime, drama. Cert15 due to graphic gory violence, but probably should have been a C18 in my opinion. Bill Nighy does a really good job of playing himself (again) – this time his character is Detective Inspector Killdare, he's been especially brought in to investigate the murders, although he's also aware that he's probably being setup to fail. There are 2 simultaneous intertwined plots, 1 - piecing together the evidence to catch the killer and 2 - following the trial of Lizzie, who is in court for the murder of her husband. Killdare is there determined to prove her innocence. To keep you on your toes, all the possible suspects are slowly introduced and we see numerous 30 second clips of each performing the murders, everyone a possible perpetrator!This is a well-made film with great production design and great costumes, though Alan Rickman would have been a 100% better Killdare."
" Great film - deserves to be a big hit
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,9,I really enjoyed this film.There is real chemistry between Bill Nighy and Daniel Mays. Nighy is electrifying as ever. Most of the supporting cast are great. It has a gloomy atmosphere and the music hall setting works well (albeit a music hall with lots of music and absolutely zero musicians!).Its not overly gory - this is a good thing as its the plot and character interplay that is strong here.The ye olde London Town setting is well done.The story moves along as quite a pace with red herrings and twists galore.We guessed whodunit 2/3 of the way through - but it was an entertaining ride nonetheless.This film is a cut above much of the generic and formulaic Hollywood fare we are fed these days.Go see it quickly while its still in cinemas - its not nearly as big a hit as it deserves to be.
" Cheap, lazy characterizations
",2017-09-10 00:00:00,1,"It seemed very promising that the film would feature figures such as Karl Marx, novelist George Gissing, and Douglas booth playing a drag queen. But, the former two are just there to take cheap shots at.George Gissing fell in love with a prostitute when he was a college student, and he wound up going to jail because he stole things from his campus in order to keep her afloat financially. After leaving prison, they embarked on a very unhappy marriage together. So, no, George Gissing was not a 'virtue signaling' ""white knight"" going around bragging about his past and wife. In one of his best novels (which deserve adaptation into film,) 'Born In Exile,' he describes some of this history and the impact it left on him.So no, I don't appreciate the detective sneering at him because he was so swayed by sociopathic lying serial killer murderer of children Lizzie (borden.) The screenwriter also seems to wrongly believe that destitute, homeless working class boys in the era didn't experience similar abuses. A cheap, empty film issuing blind polemics that tries and fails to make it's main character, a user and abuser, sympathetic, or interesting."
" Uneven but Engaging
",2017-09-10 00:00:00,7,"Despite being yet another film set in London (yawn) The Limehouse Golem is atmospheric and will certainly hold your attention. This is partly due to the detailed scenic constructions that create a dark, intimate atmosphere but also due to the excellent casting. Juan Carlos Medina brings out the best in the cast. Watch how he uses the actors' eyes to communicate directly with the audience via the camera lens. Oliva Cooke, alternately resembling Emma Watson and Julia Roberts, glows and sparkles and then freezes as the film jumps between her recalled memory and her jail cell. Sadly, the usually wonderful Bill Nighy only hints at his customary quirkiness and the inferred gayness of Nighy's Inspector Kildare and Daniel May's gentle George Flood seems strangely pointless. The interplay between audience the stage of the music hall and the audience draws the cinema audience right into the heart of the action. The music hall scenes are beautifully re-imagined and are a joy to watch. Douglas Booth turns in a beautifully sensitive portrayal of Dan Leno that reminded me of Eddie Redmayne in the Danish Girl. Despite the fact that the film is a little under-written - I worked out the identity of the Golem about one third of the way through the film -this is a very enjoyable and convincing tale that is well told. My major criticism of the film is that it is overlong. Sometimes less is more and the film would have benefited by tighter editing of the final scenes where fantasy and fact become confused leading to the audience being not quite sure what is happening. Overall, though, a very enjoyable couple of hours spent in the cinema and please, film producers,let's have more films like this. But please also remember that London was not the only location in the UK where dark deeds happened in Victorian times. There was, and is, life and interest outside London."
" Nice. Nice. Nice.
",2017-09-10 00:00:00,7,"Well crafted movie with a beautiful cast, good aesthetics and some nicely twisted elements made for a enjoyable watch even tho from my point of view, the ending is quite predictable from the very start. It was rather obvious the destination, yet the journey remained suspenseful and filled with little hidden gems here and there.Bill Nighy is one great actor, I'm sadden by the fact that he didn't manage to make a bigger splash earlier, but even now, his presence on the screen brings so much force, so much seriosity, that you take everything in deeper and leaves behind quite an impact with every line he says. He was perfectly cast here, as the other actors too, a diversity and character development that I loved from the very start.Of course I will recommend this movie, but bare in mind, there is close to no horror here, you will find no such thing, but only the horror of man. What man is capable of, his hideous crimes, selfishness, but has nothing to do with jump scares or tension.Cheers!"
" Excellent period murder mystery and psychological thriller
",2017-09-09 00:00:00,9,"The film moves back and forth in time as it covers the investigation into ""The Limehouse Golem"" who has committed numerous murders in the Limehouse area of London and the trial of Elizabeth Cree, who is accused of poisoning her husband. It is based on the critically- acclaimed novel ""The Trial of Elizabeth Cree, or Dan Leno and the Limehouse Golem"". The acting by Bill Nighy, Olivia Cooke and Douglas Booth is outstanding. Eddie Marsan, Sam Reid and Daniel Mays all brought depth to their minor but important roles. The costuming, set design and photography fully created the atmosphere of this period in London. Much of the film takes place in a music hall, where risqué melodramas are performed: those scenes are fully realized recreations of the period. As with any thriller and mystery, it is not possible to provide any details on the plot. It is not a spoiler to say that there are multiple threads that are seamlessly woven together. Overall, it is an excellent film."
" Here we are again!
",2017-09-09 00:00:00,6,"The period drama is a genre to which Britain's film and television industry value a great deal for. History and film appear to go hand in hand within Britain's entertainment sector, arousing in such productions as Downton Abbey, Ripper Street, The Woman in Black, Peaky Blinders and Taboo, just to name some of the most recent successes. Now Jane Goldman, the writer of the most successful British horror film of all time, The Woman in Black, takes us back to Victorian era London where the community of Limehouse lives in fear of the mythical serial killer known as The Limehouse Golem. In this pre-Jack, the Ripper story, Detective John Kildare, played by Bill Nighy, is assigned the case and during his investigation, he finds himself emotionally attached to Lizzie, a woman accused of killing her husband and who is also a key asset to solving the Golem case. The Limehouse Golem is a mediocre mystery film, but one which fantastically develops its two leads and features an outstanding performance from Olivia Cooke.The film itself begins as a murder mystery but quickly shifts its focus towards the character Elizabeth Cree, played by Olivia Cooke. The film essentially becomes her life story, a story paved in abuse and rape, but equally as much resilience making, Lizzie a strong feminist character. Lizzie's life, as viewed by Detective Kildare, holds the key to unveiling the mystery of the Golem, but the film plays a dangerous game, one that can easily reveal its hand before the final bets have been placed. The films main focus will arouse suspicion as to its ending, I even entertained the thought of what was to be the conclusion of the film, however, the film isn't as predictable as one might think even if nothing is really unexpected. Goldman installs a number of twists and turns to keep the audience on their toes, second guessing everything and hence providing somewhat expected moments with a surprisingly unexpected feel. The Limehouse Golem is a film that could easily slip into the boring and predictable, but Goldman's attempt to avoid this is felt, even if the reveal doesn't go unconsidered.As aforementioned, The Limehouse Golem is essentially Lizzie's life story. Goldman's script thus creates a very complex character in Lizzie through excellent character development, which the story obviously gives an opportunity for. This complex character is made all the more fascinating by Olivia Cooke's terrifically versatile performance. Cooke embodies the poor girl opening herself up to the world, but who is also hiding/ not telling us something. As a spectator, I found myself feeling for Lizzie similarly to how Kildare does, with sympathy and respect that almost blinded me from the inconsistencies. As well as Lizzie, Kildare has a subtle yet effective form of character development to him, adding a rather complex and enduring reason as to why he wishes to save Lizzie. Goldman writes Kildare and Lizzie, as well as the rest of the film, in a surprisingly politically correct way, one which isn't conventional of Victorian era period pieces, and so works in the film's favour.The Limehouse Golem is a valiant attempt by Jane Goldman at shaking up the Victorian period drama. The murder mystery is a slippery slope, but the film excels as a character piece as well as a feminist/ politically correct text. Olivia Cooke shines in the film, bringing her complex character to full fruition despite the flaws the surround her and the production. The Limehouse Golem can best be described as probably the best BBC TV movie ever."
" The Limehouse Golem Film Review
",2017-09-07 00:00:00,8,"The new horror thriller film set in the Victorian Era The Limehouse Golem starring Bill Nighy, Olivia Cooke, Douglas Booth, Eddie Marsan, Daniel Mays.The Limehouse Golem is set on the unforgiving, squalid streets of Victorian London in 1880, our tale begins in the baroque, grandiose music hall where the capital's most renowned performer Dan Leno (English actor Douglas Booth - Noah, Jupiter Ascending) takes to the stage. The whimsical thespian performs a monologue, informing his dedicated audience of the ghastly fate of a young woman who had once adorned this very stage, his dear friend Elizabeth ""Lizzie"" Cree (English actress Olivia Cooke - Me And Earl And The Dying Girl, Ouija); for the beguiling songstress is facing up to her forthcoming death by hanging, having been accused of murdering her husband John Cree (Australian actor Sam Reid - '71, The Riot Club). Lizzie's death seems inevitable, until Detective Inspector John Kildare (English actor Bill Nighy - Love Actually, Shaun Of The Dead) is assigned to the case of the Limehouse Golem – a nefarious, calculating serial killer, murdering innocent, unconnected victims, leaving behind barely identifiable corpses – and his distinctive signature in blood. All is not what it seems and everyone is a suspect and everyone has a secret.Amongst the other actors / actresses in The Limehouse Golem includes English actor Eddie Marsan (The World's End, Mission: Impossible 3) as Uncle, English actor Daniel Mays (UK TV Series Mrs. Biggs, Welcome To The Punch) as policeman George Flood, Spanish actress María Valverde (Exodus: Gods And Kings) as Aveline Ortega, English actor Adam Brown (The Hobbit films, Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales) as Mr. Gerrard, English actor Henry Goodman (Avengers: Age Of Ultron, The Damned United) as Karl Marx, Morgan Watkins (Kingsman: The Secret Service, Suffragette) as George Gissing, Egyptian actor Damien Thomas (Julius Caesar, Sinbad And The Eye Of The Tiger) as Salomon Weil, Peter Sullivan (The Jackal, TV Series The Borgias) as Inspector Roberts, Amelia Crouch (The Huntsman: Winter's War, Alice Through The Looking Glass) as Young Lizzie and Republic Of Ireland actress Siobhán Cullen (The Inside, Jimi: All Is By My Side) as Sister Mary.Overall The Limehouse Golem is a good horror thriller film filled with weird bizarre stuff, gory violence, theatre shows and plays, drama, police, detectives, a good insight in to the way of life back in the Victorian Era in the 1880's the time period The Limehouse Golem is set in, darkness, dark alley ways, murders, murder suspects, red herrings, a classic whodunnit murder cases, horse and carriages, old style black cars, a race against time to find out the killer to seek justice, some hard hitting scenes and many other things throughout the film.So I will give The Limehouse Golem an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and The Limehouse Golem is worth seeing if you like films along the lines of the Sherlock Holmes films that Guy Ritchie directed and films set in the Victorian Era like From Hell amongst others.So if you get the chance to see The Limehouse Golem in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later."
" Pre-Jack the Ripper brings genuine fear, shocks and fun
",2017-09-06 00:00:00,8,"Saw 'The Limehouse Golem' as a murder mystery fan (Victorian-era ones rank high up there along with Agatha Christie), someone who admires Bill Nighy who very nearly always does no wrong and who considers Peter Ackroyd's fictional but very witty and suspenseful book a fine read.While it was not perfect and not quite among my favourites of the year, 'The Limehouse Golem' was still a satisfying winner. It succeeded at providing an intriguing mystery, it succeeded at providing its fair share of grim shocks and it also succeeded at being fun. A word of warning, 'The Limehouse Golem' is not for the easily squeamish, it is gory and shockingly brutal. This didn't feel cheap to me though, although maybe a touch over-the-top in how frequently it happens, being one who expected it on the understanding that the film intended to be based around a mystery pre-Jack the Ripper, though in the same mould, but even more horrifying and violent. A not easy feat considering that Jack the Ripper's murders were some of the most shocking in history (at the time nobody had seen anything like it).'The Limehouse Golem' is impeccably made visually, the costumes and sets are both evocative and handsome with a wonderfully dark and austere but also attractive Gothic vibe. It's beautifully photographed too. The music brings a creepiness while convincingly conveying the atmosphere of the music hall.Juan Carlos Medina's direction is taut and stylish, while Jane Goldman adapts the book with flourish, providing a clever and intelligent script that is rich in suspense and with a healthy dose of eloquent, dry humour.Furthermore, the story is a gripping one, devilishly clever and the macabre element is quite unflinching, atmospherically this film does not hold back. The suspense levels are high, as is the shock value, the music hall atmosphere is both fun and seedy and the gender slant is interesting. Loved the knowing cameos of real-life historical figures, the most surprising and entertaining one was Karl Marx (it's not everyday where you see Karl Marx as a murder suspect) despite the ridiculous beard and overblown accent.Not that the story is perfectly executed. While most very well done and doing a good job in developing her, parts of Lizzie's back-story like the abusive mother, is a touch vague. 'The Limehouse Golem' has plenty of twists and turns. Most of them are incredibly unexpected and how everything is not what it seems is almost scary at times. There are however others that are not quite as well developed, as shocking, as fun or as important. With the exception of the absolutely killer final twist (not since the halfway twist in 'Gone Girl' has any kind of twist left me this floored), the final quarter or so was not as cohesive as it could have been.Characters hold intrigue, especially Kildare and Lizzie. Bill Nighy is on top form, from being made up to look like a historical figure who just leaped out of a painting, the elegant walk, the eloquent dry humour, his inquisitive and shrewd clue scrutinising, the world-weariness (appropriate to the role personally thought), how he treats the suspects and how questions and reminders of his station are side-lined by him.Olivia Cooke is charming, radiant and very engaging, one does care for her and roots for her innocence. Eddie Marsan does a good job in a deceptive role, and Douglas Booth in drag was a surprising standout (if anybody saw him as a miscast adult Pip in 'Great Expectations' and compare it to his role here, one would not think he wouldn't have this in him), portraying Leno's loucheness with brio that one wouldn't expect from him.In conclusion, fearsome, gruesome, handsome, shocking, suspenseful and entertaining, apart from a couple of misgivings and that it is not for the easily squeamish it was thoroughly enjoyable. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
" hard to recommend to an adult
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,6,"I wasn't particularly keen to see this in view of the very modest rating but upon closer inspection I discovered that generally this was marked down because it was felt that an unnecessary amount of blood and gore spoiled the well crafted artifice and theatricality of the piece. I beg to differ without the aforementioned blood and gore I fear I may have dropped off. The Jane Goldman script is fine, Bill Nighy is as good as I have ever seen him, Olivia Cooke is radiant and shines throughout while Douglas Booth is most effective. And yet.. this is cloaked in such colourful and campy theatrics that for me at least there is always a considerable distance between what is on the screen and what is in my head. Nothing is convincing, even those 'Yorkshire' and 'London' locations. Just how much is real street and how much CGI is impossible to tell. There is also much repetitiveness with whole scenes created with slight variation and by the end although there is nothing outrageously wrong with the film it would be hard to recommend to an adult."
" Enjoyable Gothic Who Done It
",2017-09-04 00:00:00,7,"It is London Limehouse quarter 1880 and a gruesome series of horrible murders has the city in a frenzy.This was for me one of the most eagerly awaited films of the year and a most see. I am just back from the cinema and i feel a tinge of let down, perhaps i was expecting too much, always a problem. I won't spoil it for anyone but this is as everyone must know a detective story set in pre Ripper London's mean streets that are full of poverty deprivation and depravity of every kind. Hunting the mad killer is Inspector John Kildare played rather woodenly to my mind by Bill Nighly who has none of the dynamo energy and razor sharp intellect of Sherlock Holmes in stead he has a world weary realism with rather to much laconic facial expressions to go along with the one note vocal delivery.Thank fully the film has a good pace and uses a series of plot devices to work through the suspects and keep the viewer watching to the barn storming grand finale.The tone is highly melodramatic but suits the subject very well. And so i will return to view the movie again very soon to see if Bill Nighy rendering of Inspector Kildare will resonate with me, rather better the second time around."
" Elementary
",2017-09-03 00:00:00,6,Went in blind with this one...made sure I never even seen an advert or a trailer..had a vague idea from the poster so off i went.What I found was a mini masterpiece of great storytelling.Wound into the weaving plot was a series of mini sub plots which at the time did not seem important or relevant...that is until the last 5 minutes.Put me in mind of last years superb Sherlock Holmes movie ..Very much a slow burner which almost burns out in the mid third but comes alive and keeps you guessing.Everybody does a great job from crew to costume and direction is strong and stable.The only issue I would have is it kept me thinking about ripper movies( From Hell mainly) and I didn't want that...but that's my only gripe. well worth a visit.
" Nighy shines in poor blood-fest flick.
",2017-09-02 00:00:00,4,"I decided to see this on the strength of the trailer - Victorian murder mysteries being one of my favourites - and also the fact that Bill Nighy was starring. Bill and I went to the same school together in the 60's and were taught by the same English teacher who inspired Bill to go into acting (at which he has proved immensely successful) and myself into writing (not so much so!). Nighy has done some great films over the years but, sadly, this is not one of them. The fault lies not with the characterisation of Inspector Kildare but with the gore fest of a film he has to wade through. Maybe I'm getting long in the tooth but at a certificate 15 I was not expecting such gruesome blood letting which seemed to substitute for a cohesive plot which, considering the enormous holes to be found, was possibly intended to divert the audience. The mystery of whodunnit is entangled with a confused subliminal message of cross- dressing and homo/lesbian tendencies which did nothing to advance the story or make it any more viable. The scene in which Segeant Flood holds the hand of Inspector Kildare towards the end of the film was so unlikely that it just made me laugh. There was a good film to be made from a good book but this is not it."
" The Limehouse Golem has a great deal going for it.
",2017-09-02 00:00:00,9,"The Limehouse Golem has a great deal going for it. It is based on the novel by Peter Ackroyd and then turned into a tight, witty and gripping script by Jane Goldman. Bill Nighy takes the male lead. He delivers an excellent, gripping performance of a gentle but tortured soul in a harsh world. Olivia Cooke as the protagonist also gives a fine portrayal, mixing light and dark, truth and lies with a fine touch. Do not be misled by the Golem in the title. This is neither a horror story nor fantasy. It is a drama based on the reality of Victorian East London just prior to the reign of Jack the Ripper. Those who have enjoyed the TV series 'Ripper Street' will be well satisfied by this tale. Fans of Mr Nighy will be delighted with his return to top form. One of the best films this summer, well deserving of 5 out of five stars."
" Unbelievably boring - another Jane Goldman stinker
",2017-09-01 00:00:00,2,"SPOILER: Using the same unsubtlety that made ""Kingsmen"", ""Kick-Ass"" and ""The Woman in Black"" box office hits, Jane Goldman has now turned her hand to ""costume drama"" with this adaptation of the novel ""Dan Leno and the Limehouse Golem"" by Peter Ackroyd. And just like everything else Goldman touches, this is a stinker. A big, shiny, brown, unflushable log of turgidity.What could have been an interesting murder mystery set in the lawless East End of Victorian London, is instead a mess of plot holes, historical inconsistencies and terrible ""Cockanee"" accents. At times Olivia Cooke seems to be channelling Dick Van Dyke. Indeed, gore and porn are used to gloss over a story that lacks depth or interest. Again, the blame lies with Goldman as the source novel has received plenty of critical praise. As a historian and expert on Victorian London, Ackroyd will (if he's honest with himself) be annoyed at the disrespect with which the source material has been treated.But inaccuracies and crap accents aside, the biggest problem with this film is that it's just plain boring. Yawningly boring. Fall-asleep-if-you-could boring. Watch-that-bloody-loud-Cineworld-4DX-advert-with-the-car- chase-100-times-instead boring.The fact that this movie had it's premiere in 2016 and has only just made it into cinemas in August 2017 proves that someone in the studio realised there was a problem. And a glowing review from Derek Winnert isn't going to alter the fact that this is boring tosh with a shiny gloss.Despite Bill Nighy's best efforts, you simply won't care who the killer is. Nighy is a professional, and you can tell he's trying - but the script is a steaming pile of donkey doo-doo. Worse still, you'll have guessed who the killer is within the first 30 minutes anyway.The fact that the final act makes little-to-no sense at all just increases the feeling that you've been robbed - of the ticket price and two hours of your life. Perhaps Nighy's Inspector Kildare can investigate that theft when he's returned to the Robbery Division?"
" The craft of film making at it's very best
",2017-08-21 00:00:00,10,"I really loved this film. Right from the beginning, the music hall feel of the unfolding drama was very engaging. Intelligent editing and the fabulous script kept the pace of the plot at a rate which held my interest from start to finish as each twist and turn was revealed. John Kildare (Bill Nighy) was the methodical, steady influence which balanced the emotional excesses of the other characters. He only showed emotion when confronted with the inevitability of the fate of the intelligent and articulate Lizzie Cree (Olivia Cooke). The film used dramatic devices to great effect, showing several characters actually committing the awful crimes as each became suspect. The interleaving of the music hall version of the Lizzie Cree story with the live action which somehow heightened the suspense by making you smile thus relieving tension. The sets were a total joy, completely recreating Victorian environments in very convincing fine detail. The cast were superb, totally plausible and very engaging. Don't miss this fabulous film, the craft of film making at it's very best."
" If you liked Dickensian on TV...............................
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,8,"Saw this earlier today as a freebie for Picturehouse members in Bradford. Not an advert but you do get some real goodies with membership, especially late autumn when Oscar hopefuls are being promoted. First surprise was that this was not a BBC Films production or co-production. The second surprise was the outcome.The two other reviews I have read did contain spoilers and whilst there were net fulls of red herrings, I did not catch one. That may be me or the quality of the film, all I can say that it was not as obvious as others may say and that certainly was the impression from listening to people leaving the theatre. It is however much more than a Victorian whodunnit. Whilst not having the time to develop characters as fully as BBC TV's Dickensian did, you can relate to most as characters. Admittedly there is some knockabout stuff e.g. Karl Marx as suspect. Coincidence or not, but a lot of references to same sex relationships and in 50th Anniversary Year of Sexual Offences Act 1967, which adds another layer. Engaging performances by principal cast members and well created London from late 19th century. I must confess an interest in that a lot of the exteriors were at Dalton Mills in Keighley, my town of work. Peaky Blinders has filmed here extensively and last year Kit Harrington was causing hearts to swoon. Enter in to the world and be taken along."
" Keeps you wanting to guess the murder
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,7,"THE LIMEHOUSE GOLEM won't change the world, but it's definitely worth watching if you're the kind of person who likes to watch a movie with a bit of mystery. Set in old London, this movie follows a detective who is trying to solve a series of murder cases that somehow seem to connect to the local playhouse theater of the district. There's a host of suspects, and time is running out as an innocent may be executed soon.Here's the one thing that matters for a movie like this: I definitely found myself trying to guess who the murderer was. And I really didn't know for most of the movie who it would be! So in that sense, THE LIMEHOUSE GOLEM clearly succeeded for me. There was some pretty good acting and there were interesting themes of revenge and jealousy being explored... all in all an interesting, although not world-changing, crime thriller."
" Totally unnecessary over the top violent scenes
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,1,"This film is a parody of a horror film. A parody of a detective film. It is full of familiar faces, all acting completely unbelievable roles. The only exception is Bill Nighy. But even here, though much is implied about his personal life, nothing is explored and is thus irrelevant. The plot is completely unbelievable. The outcome also. The plot is full of holes. The initial conceit - that a group of four suspects of being a serial killer contains Dan Leno, George Gissing, & Karl Marx is the author just having a laugh. An existential joke at the audiences expense."
" You know it
",2017-08-07 00:00:00,6,"The thing is I don't even think there is need for a spoiler warning, because very early on many will be able to see through this. Still and as I have ticked the Spoiler box, you are warned once again, because I will talk about who did it. So don't say you have not been warned, if you don't want to know.Having written this extensive foreword, I hope you either have seen the movie or do not care for spoilers. But if you've seen a couple of thrillers you will know very early on, that the one imprisoned is the one who did it. The movie does its best to keep it a secret and tries to get our attention to other things, but that does not change the focus and what is easily spotted. Still even with the knowledge of the Killer (she is so lovely, how could she? you may ask, but that's supposed to be the shocker), it still has its merits. Mainly the actors having fun with their roles. Bill Nighy really goes out there and there are a few things hinted at that are not entirely explored or revealed with his character. But that's OK, because the main focus is finding the Killer ... although she has been found already ... So if you don't mind knowing where it all ends and just want to enjoy the ride, there is a lot to enjoy ..."
