" short, forgettable but good enouh
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,6,"I liked most of the jokes and puns and the random cameos. It was disturbing to see kermit's body and how he ran was so traumatizing, also Constantine action sequences... please. The random prison guard side plot who was a kermit fangirl was so random and should've been more fleshed out or just...gone. It all felt so rushed and I never got invested in anything, I even forgot I saw it. Overall it was fine, entrertaining, fun to make fun of, funny sometimes and just random."
" Decent sequel
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,8,"I liked this sequel as the Muppets go on a world tour, and Kermit gets replaced with the world's most evil frog as part of an evil scam. The movie features good songs snd scenes in s Russian prison and I liked Ricky Gervais and Tina Fey's characters. Kids and fans of the Muppets will like this, and adults might find it appealing as it also features a decent plot.** 1/2 out of ****"
" The stronger of the two 2010's Muppet movies
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,10,"Much like The Great Muppet Caper, this film's more developed-and central to the film- plot allows the irrelevant humor and goofy hijinks of the characters to really shine. Ultimately, this film balances the needs to tell a story worth telling with a loose vaudeville comedy better than the prior film. It doesn't have the stronger emotional payoff of the Muppets (2011) but it is a better paced, funnier and more memorable film. A lot of which has to do with Gervais being one of the better human actors to be in a muppet film for the laughs and the character of Constantine being a wonderfully realized foil for Kermit.In any case this is a very welcome return for these characters; the film respects Henson's creations. It is-like all the muppet films-a sweet, sentimental delight."
" Great Entetainment
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,6,"Not a major fan of the muppets myself this one was definitely created for fans. Overall it was great, a brilliant plot tightly written, stuffed with stars and Ricky Gervais was great with the deadpan humour.Quite frankly what's there to not like, I'm giving a 7 for pure entertainment."
" Most wanted
",2020-09-03 00:00:00,6,I liked this just how I liked the first movie with good songs good puppet work and characters
" Love Muppet Movies!!!
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,10,This one is up there as being one of the best. Great songs! So funny and Constanine!!!! To come up with another frog as lovable as Kermit is unbelievable. The Muppets are genius!!! A timeless classic. People who give this bad reviews are just plain mean. Everyone loves The Muppets!!!! We need more muppet movies!!
" Confused, but awesome.
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,10,"The very first song they sing that the title is ""Muppets Again"", but the movie's actually called ""Muppets Most Wanted"", which confused me.Other than that small minor goof, the movie is awesome!"
" Good Caper Remake
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,10,"In 2011 I left the movie ""The Muppets"" thinking ""Wow! I hope they make a sequel!"" 3 years later I get my wish. The jokes are perfectly delivered and the breaking of the 4th wall is hilarious. I normally don't tolerate musicals, but the songs in this film don't take themselves seriously and are more satirical then dramatic, and even when the songs are slow there are plenty of visual gags to keep your attention. I had the soundtrack to the original on ad nauseam and I will be playing the soundtrack to this twice as much. There's a joke in the opening song that the ""sequel's never quite as good."" They're right. It's not as good. It's better.
Grade: A+ 10/10 5/5 stars"
" - I want every seat in the house filled. Give tickets away if you have to. - Well, it's the Muppets. It won't be easy.
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,7,"I used to follow ""The Muppet Show"" relatively regularly, and with some episodes of exception, I was most often bored, so I sat down to watch the movie (I don't even know why) with approximately these expectations. I was pleasantly surprised. A crime adventure with typically Muppet humor doesn't bring anything spectacular, but it's good fun for one watch.7/10"
" Certainly worth the watch.
",2019-12-01 00:00:00,7,"Pretty entertaining children's movie and stars the lovely Tina Fey as Nadya, a Gulag Camp Commander (yes this is the right film). A really good, solid family film with many jokes adults will find highly amusing to."
" One of the best sequels ever
",2019-11-26 00:00:00,7,"Usually sequels don't please I find them as a way for the company producing it to make easy money out of people but this movie was definitely much better than what I expected!
The songs were catchy and stuck in my head for a few months even after I watched this amazing movie I also thought that the puppetry and acting was done very well and I say that this movie is worth watching!"
" Böser Frosch
",2018-12-12 00:00:00,6,"Evil frog in german is not ""evilen frogen"" (which is a made-up word) but böser Frosch."
" yay more muppets
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,10,Review: I loved this movie because I grew up with both sesame street and the muppets. This movie really re-affirmed what I remember as a kid which was really cool. The direction and screenplay are really good. Both the casting and acting are really good. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" It got better after the first viewing
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,7,"I think I may have been too harsh on Muppets Most Wanted the first time I saw it. Perhaps it's because I was comparing it to the loving homage to childhood nostalgia that was The Muppets (2011). This sequel is missing the heart that movie had, but it still offers plenty of laughs and a story that feels very Muppet-y. It's not Muppet greatness, but it is Muppet goodness."
" Why watch the movie when the trailer gave you the ending?
",2018-06-20 00:00:00,3,"First of all, in the first musical number, they said that sequels are never quite as good. Well they got that right, because it was crap (excuse the minor language). I felt the song pretty much gave everyone an excuse to give us a film that was underpar, and BOY WAS IT UNDERPAR"
" A weak sequel
",2018-05-22 00:00:00,5,"Muppets Most Wanted was probably my least favorite Muppet movie. There were a few laughs, but it was too slow and too serious. It also felt odd watching Kermit in a Russian Prison Camp wearing Hannibal Lecter's mask and strait jacket. The previous one was much better. My favorite is still Great Muppet Caper."
" I hope this isn't the end.
",2018-03-31 00:00:00,8,"When The Muppets came out in 2011 people really liked it and therefore a sequel was made. The sequel Muppets Most Wanted was not as successful as it's predecessor. It wasn't as much a financial hit and people didn't dig it as much and it seems like The Muppets are back to the way they were after Muppets From Space. I actually really loved Muppets Most Wanted. At the time I thought it was better than The Muppets and in ways it is. The jokes are smarter. The songs are better and it feels more like a traditional Muppet movie than it's predecessor but this movie is not without it's flaws. The flaws are that Walter has more screen time than Gonzo and even Fozzie. That's just wrong! And the humans need to take a huge backseat to the Muppets. Tina Fey more than Ricky Gervais and Ty Burrell. Overall I think this is a great Muppet movie but it's so depressing how underrated it is. I hope this is not the end of The Muppets on the big screen. I'm an aspiring actor and filmmaker, maybe I should be like Jason Segel and try to bring them back if nobody else does. Even then I've always wanted to make a Muppet movie."
" Evilen Frogen
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,8,"Another Muppet film, so you know what to expect. Corny jokes, song and dance, and spoofs of otherr films. In this film Constantine utilizes a Mission Impossible escape and replaces Kermit with the goal of doing ""Pink Panther"" type of crimes.Where else are you going to see Danny Trejo and Ray Liotta perform a song and dance in their long johns? Tina Fey looked like she was having fun in her role as a prison warden. Of course they are Muppets so there are tons of cameo roles for established stars.Good popcorn fun. I would agree, they have done better."
" I thought it could not get worse after the ""relaunch"" film. Wrong!
",2017-10-11 00:00:00,5,"I am happy for those reviewers who enjoyed this movie and were able to award it anything more than about 7. I personally found it flat, boring, uninspired and a simple travesty of what ""The Muppets"" meant when Henson was alive and at the helm. Indeed, the only reason I bothered to record and watch it was in memory of Henson and all those Friday evenings long ago when the TV series was broadcast and kept us doubled up with laughter and the anarchic and loony things undertaken by Gonzo, the Swedish chef, the boomerang fish-throwing 'juggler' etc. etc. (all of whom, very sadly, just had brief ""walk on"" roles in this compendium of boredom). I really cannot for the life of me think who on earth would want to sit through this a second time; I should think kids will be bored out of their skull by it, anyone coming across the Muppets for the first time must wonder what on earth all the fuss was about and veterans like me will be dismayed at what has become of what was once one of the most imaginative, fresh and innovative creative teams working in comedy anywhere in the Western world. After the appalling ""relauch"" film, this one plumbs even new depths and it must now surely be time to let the franchise just expire and pass over, leaving us with our memories of a great comedic past?"
" to much singing
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,5,"This new Muppet's movie started out pretty good the whole ides of having a evil frog switch with a Kermit made me continue watching it, but it all fell apart when they started the singing I mean why have a story like this and then add some really crappy music with it I have to say this would have been one of the best kid flicks I would have surly bought if it weren't for the long crappy not needed music even the cameos were kinda crappy and didn't add very much to the movie at all I prefer the first Muppet's movie from 2011 because I expected ever thing from music and comdie and I really enjoyed it not so much this one thou this is what i get for not watching the trailer first"
" Not as good as the 2011 Amy Adams and Jason Segal vehicle of the muppets reboot
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,5,"Muppets Most Wanted is a sequel to the 2011 Amy Adams and Jason Segal flick about the muppets who reform after years of not being together anymore. This time however there is no Amy Adams or Jason Segal in this flick. Instead we have Ricky Gervais as Dominic Badguy who of course is the bad guy in this movie (hence the surname) who works for a Kermit lookalike named Constantine who switches places with Kermit who ends up being sent to Siberia in a prison held by Tina Fey(with a terrible Russian accent btw)as Kermit has a fake mole glued to his face and everyone thinks that his the mastermind Constantine. So now Constantine is pretending to be Kermit in order to get the Queens crown,the Muppets travel to Berlin,Dublin,London etc with Constantine/Kermit. But will the Muppets notice that Kermit isn't well Kermit?Overall this was an OK sequel to The Muppet's. I prefer the 2011 one to be honest as it was better and this sequel was sorta all over the place for me.Keep your eyes opened for the following celebs: Tom Hiddleston,Bridget Mendler,The guy from Austin & Ally,Puff Daddy,James McAvoy who all make cameos in this film."
