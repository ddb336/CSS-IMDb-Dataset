" An extremely touching film with a poor ending
",2021-02-11 00:00:00,5,"For the beginning the film is 9-10, for the middle 6 from the point of view of a man, but the ending with a purely female speech crossed out the entire film. This speech looked like a dissonance against the background of the shown her mind. How could she say that at the end, in such a way? Realizing the compulsion of certain actions?
Let me remind you, Joe Biden, the beacon of democracy recently said - violence is a forced measure, as the last argument. Let me also remind you that in his inauguration speech he said the following - ""And I promise you I will fight for those who did not support me as for those who did.""
These two phrases from 2021 from the President of the United States probably best characterize the final speech of the main character, showing the constant duplicity of the real world, in contrast to the world of idealists."
" Alicia Vikander gives a subtle and charismatic performance in this flawed but affecting film
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,7,"I have to judge this film on its own merits, as I have not read the memoir upon which it is based. So no comments on the accuracy/faithfulness/thoroughness of the adaptation. However, one fault of the movie is that it FEELS like a lot has been left out. We are asked to take some big jumps in time...we jump from high point to high point...but not taking the time to show less ""dramatic"" moments in the lives of the characters makes it a little harder to feel we know these people.We meet young Vera Brittain just months before the start of WWI. She comes from what seems to be a middle class family...enough money to have some servants, but not enough to consider paying for their smart daughter to go to Oxford for college. She's self-centered and focused on her studies...not interested too much in the frivolities of the men around her, including her beloved brother and his friends. Yet sparks fly (despite her desire to avoid such complications) with young and handsome Kit Harrington (best known as Jon Snow in GAME OF THRONES...in this film, he has no beard and is almost unrecognizable as a result). He encourages her studies and writings. They are both hoping to be Oxford bound. The viewer must presume that these folks are all thus just out of high school (or the equivalent), yet they all look far too old to just now be thinking about college. Ah well.College is interrupted by the start of the war, and the men in Vera's life are drawn into the conflict. She feels a need to serve (never fully explained), and becomes a nurse, first in England and then near the front. The men in her life move in and out of the story...but this is truly the story of Vera. Fortunately, because the script doesn't always give us all we need, we are in the hands of emerging star Alicia Vikander. (DANISH GIRL, EX MACHINA) Vikander is never less than interesting...her characters wears her emotions so clearly on her face, and we see her many inner conflicts played out so clearly on that canvas. Although I would say her performance in DANISH GIRL brings even more shades and subtlties, she still commands the screen.Part of that command comes from the fact that she is surrounded by some weak performances, and thus jumps even more clearly to the lead. Kit Harrington has some charm, but really not a lot of depth. And as Vera's parents, Emily Watson is given NOTHING to do but look dowdy (such a waste of a great actress) and Dominic West once again proves that he is a supremely over-rated actor...from his terrible Baltimore accent in THE WIRE to his ridiculous little role in 300, West's appeal is completely lost on me. Taron Egerton, as Vera's brother, fares a bit better, and has the most interesting character arc.It sounds like I'm mostly complaining, but now let me state that despite some noteworthy weaknesses, the drama inherent in this subject matter is quite compelling and the film is still quite affecting. WWI and the truly horrific conditions the soldiers endured, coupled with the primitive medical care they received, make from gripping stuff. With Vikander's strong performance anchoring everything, we see through her eyes the horror she sees. The film features some lovely cinematography, especially in the opening scenes, so we see quite starkly the contrast between the beauty of a peaceful world and the ugliness of a world at war. The film is low budget, so there are no real battle sequences...Vera was never in a battle, so how could we see one? This is not a movie that pretends to be telling the history of WWI. It is a film that shows the brutality and senselessness and randomness and sadness of war. While not exactly charting new territory, TESTAMENT OF YOUTH brings its own perspective on that familiar territory, and that's enough to make the film very worthwhile."
" Not as good as the BBC miniseries
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,6,"This is a heart-wrenching story dramatically told with an excellent cast, costumes, and settings. But to anyone who has read Vera Brittain's wartime memoir, it's evident that the scriptwriter was given the basic backgroundof the story and then told to just make stuff up. A much more accurate account of the book is the 1979 BBC mini-series by the same name. Being shorter, the movie had to leave things out, like Vera's nursing service on the island of Malta. But there's no excuse for going light on the bonding that took place between her and Roland as they fell in love. They shared poetry and a love of reading and discovered that they were true soulmates before he went off to war. Some inaccuracies also crop up, for example when Roland develops a fever as he ships out in 1916 they fear he may have the Spanish Flu, which didn't really become an epidemic until 1918."
" Immy's review : Harrowing
",2020-08-10 00:00:00,9,"The beauty of this movie is that it's able to depict the tragedies, loss of life and utter devastation caused by the war, without actually showing the war itself. The movie is shown through the eyes of young Vera Brittain (Alicia Vikander) whose entire life is turned upside down by the destruction of war. The film is incredibly sad because a young woman's dreams, ambitions and youth are ultimately striped away from her for the sake of a meaningless bloodshed, and loses everything she deems important. I love that the movie conveys to us that it isn't just the soldiers who suffered, but everyone ; all of the women who lost the men closest to them, the women who had to give up what they had fought so hard for, the estranged impact on families, mothers, fathers...This movie is a true representation of what the war meant for those who were left behind. Alicia gave a terrific performance ; her character felt honest and genuine, and she gave a lot of depth to a complex character who is perhaps difficult to play, so ultimately she nailed it. The movie had beautiful cinematography ; evoking a soft and romantic atmosphere, whilst strongly contrasting with the horrors and tragedy of war she must face, emphasising the sense of loss of her youth and normal life. Her and Kit Harrington had a wonderful spark and chemistry. The poems he reads aloud are truly electrifying and created a warm, hazy feeling. The build up of their romance, and Veras apparent strong relationship with her brother and the other men in her life make the ending ever more devastating, as you get so sucked into the story and the characters, and then for it to just fade away and see Vera's life transform, is truly soul crushing. This film is terribly sad but brutally honest, successfully getting the message across that war is completely meaningless, and changes everyone's lives for the worst. I found the armistice day celebrations particularly thought provoking...after losing everyone she loves, what is there really to celebrate? The millions of innocent lives lost? Highly recommend!"
" Downtown Abbey goes to the War
",2020-08-02 00:00:00,5,"Well acted, superb cinematography, but I felt that the movie did the opposite of what it should have done. All the stiff upper (privileged) lips and queen and country rhetoric felt thuddingly obvious, as though I was watching BBC propaganda. As my maternal granny lost all three brothers at the Somme (and my paternal grandfather all his brothers in the same battle), I think I gave all five points to the moving depiction of the actual carnage that was the war."
" Into the depths of sorrow
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,9,"WOW. This film really challenged me so emotionally. There is so much joy and so much sadness/sorrow intermingled. The bright stars of young adulthood, shining like kleig lights, suddenly are darkened and remanded to memory.I wept. Yes, indeed, I did weep. War is so decisive and final. Alicia Vikander as Vera Brittain carries her role superbly. Hers is a heavy weight to carry, as each moment of presumed joy turns into yet another tragedy.
Her dashingly handsome Roland, (Kit Harrington) husband to be, killed on the Front in France when it was all assured he was far enough behind enemy lines to be saved. But, like any good soldier, Roland felt compelled to fix a spot in the barbed wire fencing. The good and patriotic soldier does what needs to be done. Vera is notified of her husband-to-be's death on their wedding day. Somehow, I knew it was ""too good to be true"".Next, Victor Richardson (portrayed by Colin Morgan) dies in hospital where Vera now is a nurse. Vera actually proposes to Victor, who now is blind from the war. Victor declines. The next day he has died.The third knife in Vera's everloving and determined soul is when Edward, her brother, dies in Italy after Vera has saved him as a patient in hospital in France. (Edward is portrayed by Taron Egerton).What makes this all the more sour and dreadful is how the three lads were all close friends and each like a brother to Vera. Although I did not serve in combat, I did serve during the Cold War Era in classified Intel overseas. One need not serve in the battles to understand at very deep levels how the losses in war cripple the soul and spirit. The other factor that is played well in this movie is that rebounding spirit of youth. There is not mountain too high to climb or river too wide to cross. That is why the Military loves us when we are young. We embrace a certain youthful obstinate determination that Military culture thrives on.I may watch this movie again. Even get the book. But, I must be in the right mind."
" perfect movie !
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,9,"It was full of emotions , depicted war and its effects on people lifes"
" Meh
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,5,"I am not sure what it is that people like so much about this film. It was okay, but rather dull. I think I found the narrator of the story rather self-absorbed, and the telling of it by the director rather cliché and over-wrought. So it had this strange effect of being both over- and under- presented, leaving me with a bored detachment from what was happening on screen. Vikander had moments, but the rest of the cast was pretty well completely uninteresting."
" Poetry faces reality
",2020-03-06 00:00:00,7,"This story looks and moves poetically. Despite the gore of war, this movie has a beauty about it. The lead actress carries the film well. Yes, it's a predictable arc in many ways but the film drew me in and held my attention."
" Another excellent British war drama
",2019-12-20 00:00:00,9,Great performances and production of an extremely sad story. Shame it wasn't more successful bcos it's one of the better movies made that year
" Excellent, but ...
",2019-11-14 00:00:00,8,"However princely melodramatic, in it's days and society, it's still a ""downer"" once related/compared to ATONEMENT &/or JOHNNY GOT HIS GUN ... While still appreciating/understanding the ... cinematic challenge ... !?"
" they also serve
",2019-11-10 00:00:00,6,"The subtly beautiful Alicia Vikander gives a mesmerising performance here as a woman stricken by the WWI deaths of her menfolk. The trouble is that there's nowhere for it to go, except for her to realise that War is Bad - which is handled ham-fistedly as a street-corner debate with some Jingos. I can't help feeling it's a little self-indulgent to single out a story like this. So many women were bereaved, so many men were killed - and who's to say which had the worst of it? - and they didn't all get to make the privileged choices about it that Vera Brittain and her coterie did. And is there also something self-indulgent about our Remembrance fixation, which seems to get stronger as the events recede in time - and yet which somehow leaves a group of Millenials like The Apprentice candidates unable to say what year WWII started?"
" Right in the feels and not when you expect it
",2019-08-28 00:00:00,9,This movie/story brings us viewers closest to the great war as possible for a outsider. It shows the big change in mentality that even effected the next big war. In such detail i have never seen before.It is the never ending loses during times where time can feel frozen and flying at once.The nightmares I had of a possible war when I read a lot of world war 2 stories gave the exact same feeling as this movie does. And none other movie has achieved that before. The restained feeling when live is dictated instead of molded.Bravo to the maker of the movie but even more to the writer of this story. She succeeded where nobody else really did. She made an idea that spread through almost all of western europe for over a 100 years. 'This never again'. Altough history has taught us that war sometimes is inevitable this idea has prevented many of them. It broke the idea of war idealised with bravery and heroïsm.
" 10
",2019-06-11 00:00:00,10,"The absolute 10star movie. Yes, it was. If you didn't rate it there, I wonder where your heart is?"
" I've seen a lot of ""war movies"" , enough to go oh no, not another one of those!
",2019-02-16 00:00:00,10,"For I mean heck, I want to feel OK for a couple of hours and how is another dismal gloomy war story going to do that with all its inherent ties to lugubrious everything , everything that is unnatural and not part of the goodness of the commonwealth going to do anything but dampen my spirits...and yet amongst these trying times and something so all inclusively terrible, is born something to incredibly beautiful, this tale has it...This is very very nice..."
" Watch this movie!
",2019-02-03 00:00:00,9,This is such a tragic yet beautifully told story through not just its elegant cinematography but through the actors whom have fully immersed themselves into becoming these characters. Knowing that it is also based on a true story is devastating considering what occurs. Definitely a must see war film and have some tissues ready!
" All Lovely and Shining On The Western Front (Guest Review by Paul Baumer)
",2018-12-04 00:00:00,2,"God, this is Paul Baumer. He didn't want to watch this film. He already knows what it's like to die on a beautiful summer day when it's all quiet on the Western Front. But after watching this film, Paul and his friends all felt worse than when Behm got blinded by shell fire that night on wiring detail!Why is the pretty little dark-eyed girl with the cute hats and the nagging voice so irritating? Is it because she's utterly perfect and always right about everything? Paul Baumer wasn't perfect. He didn't know everything in the first scene of his story. In face he knew nothing at all!But Paul Baumer learned, and along the way he met other people, people he didn't know before the war. Unforgettable friends like Cat, and Tjaden. Enemies like Himmelstoss. War made all of these men suffer, but they did more than stare dreamily into space and talk about flowers and poems. Now and then they took time out to fight. And die.The lovely young miss in the cute hat doesn't die. All her men friends die, but they stay lovely and shining till the very end. They never cheer about getting an extra can of beans to eat. They never battle rats or burn lice over an open flame. They don't get angry or curse their schoolteacher or their sergeant . . . or their parents or the war or God. They're all to pure and good to really feel anything one way or the other. All the soldiers in this movie are so very upper class, so lovely and shining. Maybe that's what they should call this movie.All Lovely and Shining On The Western Front"
" Ghosts
",2018-11-27 00:00:00,9,"Near the end of the film, this line: ""We are surrounded by ghosts. Now we must learn to live with them."" It all but sums up what moved me deeply in this extraordinary account of love, war, loss and regeneration. This almost flawless film strikes straight to the heart and, for once, I found its intense emotionality not cloying or manipulative, but appropriate. Outstanding acting and sublime cinematography throughout. To point out its few little flaws would be ungracious and quite irrelevant. Given its subject matter, one would have to be made of stone not to weep through some of it; at times it felt almost unbearable to watch, but watch it, I feel, one must."
" Solid retelling, but not much depth
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,6,"TESTAMENT OF YOUTH is the latest filmed version of the memoirs of Vera Brittain, who charts her life story during the First World War. It's a tale of romance and foreboding, of warfare and peace, of healing and nursing, all tied up in a searching narrative. From the trailers I was expecting this to be heavy on trench scenes, but the war material is quite scarce and usually kept off-screen; the focus very much is on Brittain herself. The film has the visual quality and measured pacing of a typical BBC drama adaptation, and there's no faulting the attention to detail. I did like the way that it doesn't shy away from the darker psychological aspects of the story. The supporting cast is fine, and Alicia Vikander is okay as the protagonist, but not entirely sympathetic; you never feel like there's much going on inside her head."
" Dull and hectoring rubbish preaching a line that we already know.
",2018-09-15 00:00:00,2,"Nicely photographed film but unsatisfying drama, clinically depicting the effect 'the great war' has on an annoying young student. Tragedy after tragedy plays out and this almost saintly martyr leaps from one anguished scene to another crying, sulking or shouting at people. Alicia Vikander, while lovely to look at, elicits no sympathy from the audience. The character she plays bears no resemblance at all to the complicated and intelligent woman from the book.The movie is delivered in such a contrived and melodramatic way that it feels like the director is sitting next to you with a box of tissues! There is no discernible chemistry of love or hate between any of the players and you get the feeling they showed up a few minutes before each scene was shot, handed their lines and then marched into action with a view of making it to the catering coach before the good sandwiches had been taken.It was just dull, boring and predictable."
" Anthem For Lost Youth
",2018-05-16 00:00:00,9,"I watched the TV adaptation of Testament of Youth many, many years ago. As we were studying World War One at school, the destruction and carnage left me horrified; therefore I was deeply moved by Vera Brittan's account of fledging love and war time losses. I picked up this version of Netflix last night with great interest; could it, I wondereed, top the series that left me spellbound nearly three decades ago?The answer is not quite, the BBC TV series just shades it. I think the series alllows the characters a little more development time than the film allows. Nevertheless, there are a great many merits to this film. Although some of criticism of Alicia Vikander's Vera were a little harsh - she was growing up in a restrictive Edwardian, where 'young ladies' where expected to behave in a certain way - the cast and direction are uniformly first rate. I got a vivid impression of Rupert Brooke's England - lush, pastoral, with carefree youths at one with nature; a long vanished tranquility, that perhaps never really existed, except innoir imagination.The scene at the railway station was nothing short of heartbreaking - it is here, with Roland's departure, that enormity of what might happen actually sinks in.As the war drags on Vera volunteers as a nurse, anything to be closer to her loved ones at The Front - a fiancee, a brother, two close friends. She copes amidst the horrific carnage, the grim aftermath that's far from the honour and glory. Like the women left behind in all wars since the dawn of time, through a series of hard lesson she learns to gradually cope with the responsibilities thrust upon her - whilst living in a state of near constant trepidation; anything to avoid the dreaded telegram.I remember her compassion towards the dying German soldier - the enemy who bleeds the same blood, has the same flesh as we do.Her world is shattered many time over; War, grief and illness bleed her. It is staggering to think how many families must have went through same ordeal - only to emerge with wrecked lives into a confused and dangerous new world with no clear answers. Vera Brittan's work is for the survivors and their ghosts, for anyone who survived a war and asks 'why?' on their lips. It is a superb film and a worthy adaption. Watch it or the TV series."
" Genuine
",2018-04-17 00:00:00,9,"It's not an overly similar movie, but as I've recently watched Atonement, Testament of Youth gave me that same sort of touchingly effective drama with a backdrop of a world war. Obviously, the two are very differently told films. But they proved to each impress in a similar way. For Testament of Youth, this was Alicia Vikander and Kit Harrington's coming out party, at least in the film world. The latter is famous for his turn in that one certain HBO show while Vikander hadn't really done anything of notoriety before this, and she is absolutely the best part about this film. Whether it be as the tomb raiding Lara Croft, the grieving Isabel Graysmark, or the curious Ava, she is brilliant in anything she does. In fact, she's quickly becoming one of my favorite actresses to watch, merely for the sheer charisma she brings with every role. And as much as I want to commend Harrington, Taron Egerton, Dominic West (who ironically also plays her father in Tomb Raider), Colin Morgan, Hayley Atwell, and Emily Watson, no one comes close to Vikander's performance here. If this film didn't get lost in her year of Danish Girl & Ex Machina, perhaps she could have been an awards contender for this film. In fact, this may be my favorite performance of hers. Can I be anymore genuine about her utterly genuine turn?9.0/10"
" People and society changed for ever by the awfulness of the Great War
",2018-03-03 00:00:00,9,"This is a film in which we see the war through the eyes of Vera Brittain - played beautifully (perhaps almost too beautifully) by Alicia Vikander. The original book is autobiographical based largely on real events. We first meet Vera as a cosseted and headstrong young girl whose main longing is for a chance to study at Oxford, but as the film progresses the war begins and forces itself into everyone's lives. With her friends joining up, Vera feels it her duty to serve as a nurse - firstly in England and later close enough to the front line to hear the sound of the guns and trudge through the all pervasive mud.The horrors of treating dreadful wounds with woefully inadequate resources are shown in sufficient - but not obsessive - detail. There is a lot of blood. Vera becomes hardened by her experiences and learns the strength of will it takes to survive. And it is this inner strength that carries her, and us as the audience, on through all the horrors that war threw her way. Shortcomings of the production are generally trivial, to my mind the most significant being the somewhat patchy portrayal of regional accents. On the other hand a great strength is a feeling of authenticity for some of the lines. You feel we might well be hearing the exact words that were used as real people reacted to their torment a hundred years ago. And understanding some of the thoughts and feelings that were left unexpressed.There's poetry too. It's a massive challenge to present poetry with the right tone in this kind movie, and I felt they achieved it remarkably well.I now definitely feel I should read the book. So it must be a good film."
" Vikander bewitches in exquisite portrayal of Vera Brittain's WWI experiences
",2017-12-25 00:00:00,9,"In the context of this film still a strong-willed young woman, Vera Brittain (1893-1970) is a real-life figure well known for her pacificism of more recent years. This transformation is not entriely surprising given the way the First World War scythed through Vera's small circle of male acquaintances, be these her brother Edward (here played by Taron Egerton), his (and her) close friend Victor (Colin Morgan) or the man she falls in love with Roland Leighton (Kit Hartington). All the more so, as the months pre-War are ones of prosperity and carefree joy for these young people that the film portrays lovingly in Yorkshire settings, as well as at Oxford, given the fact that Vera pioneeringly succeeds in passing her exams to go there along with the boys. Boys is scarcely a wrong word here, as the war takes the Military Cross-winning Edward at age 23 in 1918, Victor at aged 22 in 1917, and Roland at aged 20 in 1915.And when the lovely, intense, at-time almost spellbinding Alicia Vikander plays Vera, we feel the magnitude of her loss, and wonder along with the character how she might possibly go on at all. The film only hints at her managing to do this, showing how she begins with her anti-war campaigning, not least because her time as an Army nurse has seen her tend to (and indeed talk to - given her linguistic knowledge) dying Germans as well as Brits.As one might expect, James Kent's rendering of ""Testament of Youth"" is beautiful, nostalgic, profoundly touching, persuasive and thought-provoking given the abrupt stop that was put to a very promising time for the whole country, as well as for so very many of its sons."
" This brilliant work should have received an Oscar
",2017-12-23 00:00:00,10,"This is definitely one of the brilliant underrated,overlooked films.It tells the true story of a courageous, intelligent young woman who lost all her beloved ones during the first world war and later on became one the war pacifists. I have not read the book, but I did some reading on Vera Brittain, I should say that the screenplay has touched on all the key parts of her story at the time.The best way to tell if a film is succesful is the beginning and the end, and this film has has excelled beauty and strength in both. It should have definitely at least won an Oscar for best screenplay/leading actress, and funny but it has received no awards for screenplay or directing. It is even pointless to applaud Alicia Vikander's acting ,it was that excellent, she could have easily received a best leading actress Cscar with this one.I don't want to think that it was totally missed for telling a woman's story and hope that was not the case. I can watch very few films more than once,and this is one of the few films I can do so burst into tears each time It is that powerful.Don't miss this film."
" One of the best drama movies which I have seen
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,8,"It is one of the movies which changes the viewer perspective in many things Full of life tragedies and suffering combined with hopes , dreams and fear It is a heartbreaking movie with a great real life contemplation. A lot of believes , principles and life views will changes after this kind of life pains. thanks for letting us knowing that without real life experience. Thanks for everyone participate in it"
" Iraq 1.0 Sensitive treatment of war's annihilation of life and love
",2017-05-18 00:00:00,8,"Fine performance from Alicia Vikander, revealing the sensuality beneath the intellect, the steel inside the woman.The men's performances work well, too, because the director has drawn out the essence: innocent young men cast into a furnace.Don't be fooled by the first part. This is not Masterpiece Theatre. But Brittain was the daughter of an upper class, wealthy family, and you can't understand the shock of the war's devastation without first experiencing her innocent, luxurious life before.""You don't know what you have until you lose it."" The book wasn't published until 1933, so this story represents the fruits of mature reflection on the personal costs of the war.If I have one objection, it's that in the hospital and war scenes, the women always seem so well groomed and their clothes so clean. I wanted more disheveled hair, and soiled, torn and patched uniforms,(For a film about the Great War from a different perspective, that of a Scottish farmer's wife, see ""Sunset Song,"" with Agyness Deyn.)"
" Watered down version of a famous memoir
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,5,"I was so disappointed with this movie. At one point, early on, Vera Brittain gives an opinion on one of Roland Leighton's poems, saying she 'can't see him in it'. That's pretty much how I felt about this movie. It sort of told Vera's story but somehow I couldn't really see her in it either. Maybe it was aimed at a generation now so removed from the customs and self discipline of Vera's generation that it wasn't felt necessary to replicate it. Certainly the mud, the horror and the general bedlam of World War 1 were all present, but the characters and the story line seemed two dimensional rather than three dimensional. And whilst it would be impossible to convey the complete bitterness and anguish of a young woman who experienced the horror of losing a loved one, in the same way that the memoir did, I have seen more convincing television productions in the past. And the final insult came at the end when Vera returns to the location shown at the beginning of the movie, as Roland's poem Hédauville is recited, and even that is watered down and incomplete."
" About a young woman during World War I
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,8,"I found that this movie was very sad because just like World War 2, loved ones were lost, overcrowding hospitals, soldiers,etc. Alicia Vikander was absolutely excellent at playing the role as the writer Vera Brittain. I seriously didn't know that Vera Brittain was a real person until before the credits that she was an actual help nurse during World War I. It really makes you think, what was it like back then? I'm sure it was pretty rough looking after all the injured and the dying soldiers at the same time. It probably was pretty exhausting for running around looking after everyone! It's heartbreaking that her fiancée, her brother, her brothers friend and many others she knew who fought in the war. I swear, even thought the actor's are not the actual people, it still breaks your heart. If you haven't cried while watching this, something is wrong here. It's just so sad, that's all I can say😢😢😢😢💔💔💔💔 💔💔💔"
" Handsome adaptation but too safe
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,5,"Author Vera Brittain's daughter was Education Secretary for the the Labour government of the late 1970s. I was actually at school during that time and I guess some of her mother's radicalism had passed off to Shirley Williams. It is probably important to mention this, because these days when you portray a petulant female standing up for equality in the early part of the twentieth century there are always accusations of political correctness gone mad. Vera Brittain's legacy is more than just her autobiographical novel which this film is based on.We see Vera Brittain (Alicia Vikander) fighting with her father to apply for a place at Oxford University, he tells her that he cannot afford it. She is surprised that she is offered a place but her female tutor makes it clear that women are expected to be a lot better than the men to get on at Oxford.As soon as Vera enters university, Britain enter the Great War and there is initial excitement between Vera, her brother Edward, her boyfriend, Roland Leighton and other mutual friends. Many of them want to their bit for the country and enlist, Vera again pesters her parents to allow Edward to join the army and she also takes a break from her studies to become a nurse.These young men mainly around 20 years old perished or got injured in the war. Her fiancé Roland she finds out did not die quickly and painlessly as the note from the army said but struggled with his wounds for hours and without morphine.After the war is over Vera returns to her studies but is despondent to the misery and deaths caused by the war. The real life Vera Brittain became a pacifist.Although the book written in 1933 recounts the horrors of the Great War, the problem with the film is the death of thousands of young men is nothing new as it has been done many times now on film and television. It is an admirable period adaptation of the book but also rather safe and anaemic."
" Don't believe the glitz
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,1,"Reeking of romance, spotless unrealistic visuals, awful casting and not a speck of dust. This is a lovely, sad, nice and boring film. It has nothing to do with the brilliant book. Vera is portrayed as a two dimensional character ignoring her complex and fascinating ideals and ideas. Imprinting glamour serves to distort and dilute a classic piece of writing. 'Lets get some tea..' Just about sums up the inane script. More pregnant pauses than a maternity ward and they really didn't capture the institutional gloom at the time. Still nice hat though.."
