" Pathetic experience
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,5,"""American Heist"" is an infuriating and frustrating experience for audiences crazed for a good criminal film. The heavy ammount of cliches and stolen ideas used here is actually criminal and beyond belief...not to mention this is a remake from an obscure film of the 1950's. And it's a pity that the likes of Adrien Brody and Hayden Christensen are wasted in such a poor film whose purpose it's to waste audiences time instead of providing a good distraction.The dramatic idea of two brothers involved and reunited as criminal partners thanks to the circumstances when one of them is released from prison and owes favors to those who saved him when in need is not new in the movies. Brody makes it quite compelling for such character at times while Hayden is okay playing the good brother who tries to forget the past and his small prison sentence.But it's lousy and boring execution makes of ""American Heist"" a unnecessary film where all we get are stupid characters, stupid actions and stupid decisions as the thing progresses. It was cringeworthy, slow and restrained through most of it all. The bank robbery was a joke! It's like all of those robbers were dumb to a whole new level of dumb. Everything was bad planned and the plot holes and inconsistences made it all look terrible and painful to watch. And I'd like to think a better movie could be made from this. Maybe....Except from some good dramatic moments (the thrilling bits were a bore fest), specially the scenes between Hayden and Jordana Brewster, the movie is weak. Brody and Frank Sinatra's mugshot shoulder tattoo was a plus for him. Fun to look at it, slightly comedic and way better than his tries-hard-to-be-funny lines.I wasn't expecting much from it but the ultimate result made me a lot mad about it. Can't recommend it at all. 5/10"
" You can tell that the atrocious talentless rapper had a hand in making this film
",2020-12-28 00:00:00,1,Adrien brody is super annoying and cringeworthy as a gangster. The two lead gangsters (the rapper and his friend) couldn't arrange a pee up in a brewery. Hayden Cristensen role is unbelievable as he just isn't the type for playing a cheap thug. This dreadful crap is what you get when you let a vulgar rapper in on its planning. You also have to sit through 2 of his track's (won't refer to it as music) and as many reviewers have said the helicopter scene is just so stupid when he shoots at it.
" A soap opera, with an incidental bank robbery
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,1,"Good heist films are so rare. This is another really crappy one.
It's not really a heist film, it's a soap opera, with an incidental bank robbery.
A cringeworthy 90 minutes of pampered actors pretending badly to be tough guys then crying to gain audience sympathy.
It is so transparently artificial and is not the least bit believable or entertaining.
As for the bank job - there is no engagement in the planning and there is no getaway plan. They make no attempt to get away clean with the money, they know the cops are on the way but keep packing bags with money until they arrive... ridiculous.
The heist is just an artificial plot device to justify explosions and a derivative shootout finale... on foot because they already shoehorned the obligatory car chase earlier in the film and obviously wanted this film to be compared with Heat...
I was wishing I'd watched something else well before the halfway point - but you hang on in hope of something worthwhile, just one little nugget. Nope, this is utterly forgettable."
" Poor acting dumb plot
",2020-12-18 00:00:00,1,"Besides rushed and poor acting, when he shoots down a helicopter with a handgun, it's just dumb."
" Bad film
",2020-10-08 00:00:00,3,"Bad story, bad acting of Adrien Brody which is weird because I like him. The only thing good about it was Jordana Brewster."
" Poor acting and storyline
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,4,"The worst robbery movie I have ever watched.
The storyline is too poor. Do no t make any sense. Bad background music, poor actions, poor story, the romance between the Guy and Female cops do not make any sense."
" Should've quit sooner
",2020-06-04 00:00:00,4,"Yeah I'm gonna keep this short. This is an awful below average film. The writing is absolutely juvenile, the directing is sub par, the soundtrack is incredibly cheesy and annoying at times and the actors are just dreadful.Most offending were the godawful character choices made by James, incredibly inconsistent. Also due part of the writing, you root for nobody in this movie.But before I get ahead of myself, I dropped out of this movie halfway, I was bored to my core and just could not care for anything. Also nothing happens besides constant bad and illogical character choices from James during the first half. Apparently the heist comes towards the end, but from what I read it's nothing worthy of redemption.The reviews are on point, if you want to watch a below average movie and waste your time, go ahead.Don't bother with this movie. 4/10"
" not bad at all
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,7,A very watchable action movie with great acting and good story. Overall I enjoyed watching it.
" American Heist
",2019-11-18 00:00:00,4,"I keep hearing that Hayden Christensen is this underrated actor, that there's more to him than the awful Anakin performances. I guess that's true? He's not terrible here. I mean, he's not good but he's not awful. He is, however, massively outclassed by Adrien Brody who, even while dealing with some ridiculous dialogue outemotes Christensen on every level.At the end of the day, this is a generic and forgettable heist movie. If that's your jam, go nuts but this is not a great movie and is perfectly suitable as a Netflix search deep dive."
" Watchable
",2019-11-11 00:00:00,5,"The overall message of the movie was solid.
The acting was decent. Good cast. However the script/dialogue was terrible - ignorant & unoriginal. To me this was what really doomed it in terms of this being a quality story. The ending had potential & would have earned it 6 stars from me had it not played out as it did...basically left without an ending. You can assume how it will play out for the lead but it doesn't leave you with any answers. Maybe that's ok.So here's what I'll say: it's not bad and it's not great. Is it worth watching? Sure. But there's a reason why you've never heard of this film."
" congratulations!
",2019-10-28 00:00:00,1,"To me!I got to the end of this movie without having to phone 911I don't know how much Netflix paid for the rights to this piece of unutterable garbage but if it was more than 99c then they got stiffed.I've suffered through some lousy pieces of trash with my membership of the said Netflix but this one takes the cake for every aspect of the project.The acting is hokey and Adrian Brody is almost unwatchable.. in fact he is unwatchable.... and the script he has to deliver is so bad you cringe at just about every word.The plot is as loose as someone who's just drunk a glass of prune juice, it has no structure and feels like they just made it up as they went along.The final scenes are so terrible and wasteful that I had to fast forward to see how much worse it would get ....... and it did get worse.An ending that was only pleasant because you knew you didn't have to watch any more. If I hear someone calling their brother ""Bro"" any more and telling them how much they love them, I swear I'll have to attend anger management meetings.This is a stream of effluent that somehow got somehow connected to the drinking water supply"
" ONE OF THE BEST BANK ROBBERY MOVIES EVER!!!
",2019-07-07 00:00:00,8,"This is one of the grand masters of robbery films. To me this film isn't just about the heist. Almost 2/3 of the movie is just Frankie and Jimmy arguing and cursing at each other and its gets really repetitive fast. It also feels really realistic the way that they speak to each other, almost too real. So this part is semi boring, somewhat. The bank robbery isn't something to go crazy about. Most of almost all bank robbery movies have the robbery in the intro or if any more than one. This one felt lazy and slow paced, which i cant tell if its a good thing to make it look realistic or bad because it was just bad. Even though it wasn't that good, something about it just yells at me, maybe it was the acting, or Adrien Brody which was amazing and a great role, i always get hype when i see him. Theres only like 10 good bank robbery movies so they're kinda scarce. I've seen clips of this movie for years so its kinda with me and i like it even if i feel like its a bad."
" Boring attempt at a gritty heist film with no conclusion
",2019-07-04 00:00:00,3,"This movie is a poor attempt of a heist movie. The actual heist begins in the last 30 minutes of the film and like 15 minutes of it is exaggerated drama between the main character and his brother. Hayden Christensen in this film is again bland, repetitive and tries to pull of a horrible Italian accent. Jordana Brewster is the pretty yet generic love interest that the main character is shooting for but at the same time, the scenes they both are in are all awkward and other than a loose sex scene, all lack romance. All the other actor are either bad or just generic in their roles.The movie does not even have a definitive conclusion. This movie is not worth the budget spent on, is not worth paying any money for and is barely worth it if you just want an action film with generic heist plot."
" Poor
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,3,"It isn't about its cast. The point is that the story is so poor, especially the ending."
" Good Performances
",2019-03-24 00:00:00,6,"American Heist isn't a perfect movie, it's off in many ways. However, the three main performances are pretty solid with Adrien Brody, Hayden Christensen, and Jordana Brewster. Brewster and Christensen have good chemistry and Brody and Christensen have a good dynamic as brothers at odds end.An actor is only as good as the editing and at times some of the editing is bad which makes some of Christensen's scenes look a little off. Christensen gave a great performance for the most part in American Heist, but when the editing is on for his performances such as Life as a House and Shattered Glass you have excellent performances by him."
" NOT Believable - Adrian ""Woody Woodpecker"" Brodie Pecks Hole In Bank Vault
",2019-03-03 00:00:00,4,"03/02/20199 A poor performance by the bi-polar peckerhead. ""Watch me cry, watch me smile and laugh, watch me cry all-over-again, as an angry cracker thuggie in yellow stained Huggies with lumps. He's a crum bumbly actor regardless of what character he plays. (never believable) The pretend director of this farce film should have used him as a lookout. With his hook-Ed face pecker he could have seen around corners without ever showing his fugly. Did I say? Adrien Brody really SUCKS? Well, he does! This movie is NOT even remotely believable."
" Really bad
",2019-02-04 00:00:00,2,I'm going to remember this one as one of the worst ever seen. It just doens't add up. And the worst of all is that you keep watching it even if it's sooo bad.
" Film is so bad
",2018-12-20 00:00:00,2,"So unrealistic, poor acting. Who ever created this movie should have there head in shame its that bad"
" Lame..
",2018-12-10 00:00:00,3,"Decent acting but definitely not realistic at all. The best part was when Brody ans Anakin skywalker get all mooshy and have a heart 2 heart meanwhile 1000 cops gather outside to kill them, sure take your time. . Listen if you want to watch a legit bank robbery film watch ""Heat"" and that's all you ever need. This one lacks luster... its decent at best.."
" One of the worst movies I've sat through
",2018-11-07 00:00:00,1,"Surprisingly bad, like not even close to anything of substance here. I actaully feel bad for Brody and Christensen to have this movie on thier rap sheet. This was like one of those Nicholas cage movies you've never heard of."
" Here's what happens after the garbage movie's garbage ending:
",2018-10-16 00:00:00,2,"Emily walks out of her job instead of relaying Jimmy's location. About 45 seconds after that, the hostages inside the bank tell cops that the 'hostage' was really a robber anyways. Later on-- the cops identify Frankie and then are able to connect his brother, who has also served time, very easily. Then they find him and he goes to prison for 25 years and Emily serves some time as an accomplice. The end. What a waste of an hour and a half lol"
" A movie with terrible acting, predictable scenarios...and annoying to watch
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,3,This is one of the worst films I have seen all year. The characters are not believable. The two things that show up have no sense and the movie is based around a ex con who is weak and gets in over his head. Crybaby sequences. A horrible heist movie. I didnt care for hurricane heist either but this hits a whole new bottom. Dont waste your time. This is exactly what movies try so hard not to be... A failure in all aspects.
" Horrible
",2018-08-18 00:00:00,1,"If you have ever shot a weapon, don't watch this movie. You couldn't even put blanks in the guns when you rack them so the slide goes forward? How does a director allow a movie to be made like this with the money spent on famous people?"
" This film is not as bad as the negative reviewers have made it out to be!
",2018-07-03 00:00:00,8,"I normally don't write reviews, but after seeing so many negative reviews I just had to. I just finished watching the film and believe many people had a hard time seeing Adrien Brody in a role portrayed as such and rated it negatively. I'll admit initially I thought he was wrong for the role, however, after giving him a chance I enjoyed his acting skills. This was more of a drama than action (although there was action at the end), but I still loved the film. I hope Adrien Brody explores more roles that are out of his comfort zone in the future!! He's been in the game for over 30 years, so c'mon give him a break and allow him to explore different characters while showing him support!"
" I feel the need to do this...
",2018-05-12 00:00:00,10,"This movie is not about the heist of the bank. It is about the heist of the childhood of two young brother and how their robbed youth led to the actions that are this movie.American Heist movie beautifully depicts the inevitable connection/love of sibilings and beautiful depicts in brief: the realities of what goes on in society today (ie: Decline of Small Local Businesses, Sexual Assaults in Prisons, How Debt Affects a Person).Yes, The title of the movie was a flop.
Yes, The plot was a little scattered.
Yes, The action wasn't the best.
And, This was still an unbelieveably written, casted and acted movieAmerican Heist has a prestigious cast of Hayden Christensen, Adrien Brody, Jordana Brewster, Akon and Tory Kittles who all play their parts very well (especially Adrien Brody) and a great touch that American Heist has, that most movie don't..., an unhappy/respectable/emotional ending."
" Wow
",2018-04-20 00:00:00,8,This was a good movie 2014? I thought it was made in 2017 till I seen the date. Glad I watched it
" A cheap terrible knockoff of Heat
",2018-04-17 00:00:00,1,"Wow, just terrible. It's like Heat, but everyone is stupid and bad at everything. The movie is full of technical errors, crappy CGI, bad acting, and a thin nonsensical plot. Please spare yourself the pain and do not watch this movie.Minor grievances: cars have not had carburators in decades, and firearms fired from the hip will not be accuratePlease hire some who lives in reality to error check your crappy movies"
" Sorriest Heist Film ever made
",2018-02-21 00:00:00,2,"Adrien Brody and Hayden Christensen probably made more than the movie grossed? I wouldn't have watched this on cable nor rental. Glad I watched for free by getting it from a local library. I've seen better B Movies made in the 1970s than this. Just sad sad sad......Giving it a 2 only for eye candy with Jordana Brewster, lol"
" Better than I expected
",2017-07-27 00:00:00,7,"I watched this Movie expecting the average 'shoot em up and car chase' story, but found it to be more rounded out and interesting. The two brothers and their relationship was the real theme of the story, the rest (including the robbery) was just filler. Overall an enjoyable watch."
" I'd recommend this movie
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,7,There's no doubt that this movie is great when it comes to production quality.The plot is quite intricate.The storyline is quite compelling.The camera angles are good.The acting was alright.The storyline was good as well.There is no doubt that this movie is a good movie and is definitely worth your time and money.
" Obnoxious dialogue mars a B-movie thriller
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,3,"American Heist is a low rent Canadian thriller about, you guessed it, a team of robbers teaming up to pull the ultimate in bank heists. It's an overworked genre for sure and the best this B-movie can do is add a couple of recognisable actors to the cast. Sadly, it turns out to be an absolutely brain-dead piece of entertainment thanks to the awful script, which thinks incessant profanity is a good substitute for wit and realism.Hayden Christensen, the ill-fated star of the STAR WARS prequels who quickly faded into obscurity thereafter, is the film's slightly obnoxious lead. Obscuring him at every turn is Adrien Brody, a far distance from his work in Polanski's THE PIANIST. Brody somehow gives a good performance despite his foul-mouthed and moronic dialogue, and he's one of the reasons I kept watching. The actual heist scene isn't too bad, but it's late in the day when it takes place and there's a lot of long-winded relationship stuff and melodrama to get through before that point."
" ""Put down your guns and I'll let you live""
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,6,"To all the negative reviewers, what exactly were you hoping for that this film didn't deliver? It's possible you're missing the point. This film is fun. Just fun. Not amazing, nothing you haven't seen before, just a good time. Bit like the Fast & Furious films, really, they're fun too. And nothing more. This film even has Jordanna Brewster, and Hayden Christensen, who is an almost identikit version of Paul Walker's character in the F&F films.Things I liked about this film:- 1. Adrien Brody. He's great in everything. He was the reason I watched this, and is now the reason I'm glad I watched it.2. The Heist scene.3. A scene involving a helicopter.4. The dialogue. There are a lot of good one liners in this film, including the one in the title of this review. There's also a good one liner about some toothpaste.So if you're scrolling through Netflix, as I was, looking for something enjoyable to fill up a bit of down time, check this out. And don't take it too seriously."
" *not all black people are like these guys
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,7,"This is one of those movies , and I'll name a handful where it seems like really real. PORT of New Orleans Bad Detective, Scanner Darkly, Less Than Zero....and there are more. But to me, this movie doesn't have any acting. Adrian Brody doesn't know any better than to be bullied by our Black cast.Hayden is his younger brother working as a lube tech and suddenly gets intimate with a new girlfriend that needed him to take a look at her vehicle..who too happens to work at the Police Dept. as a dispatch operator. No problems.Just a sad epidemic of crime,sex,blackmail...and I'm only half way into it... This film could inspire a narration for every episode of INTERVENTION on television. And again, it seems that the white guy is the pawn to the extraordinarily stronger and smarter black guy, who for some reason doesn't get killed arrested or a restraining order against them makes the movie delve as far as it has already."
