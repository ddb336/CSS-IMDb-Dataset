" Low budget money spinner with no illusions of being art
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,5,"The plot for 1971 is brilliant. An ordinary, inexperienced British squaddie gets separated from his unit in a tense and riot strewn Catholic region of Belfast over a period of 24 hours and is chased by the IRA. Will he get out alive? The film delivers on the excitement of this plot by offering two hours of fairly good entertainment. Its weaknesses is that it could have been a chance for so much more than that. It would seem that the film's producers key goal was to make the film quickly, efficiently and cheaply with an unknown cast to turn a profit with no pretensions of making great art. Its biggest weakness is that its lead actor, Jack O'Connell (in almost every scene) is given very few lines and so little emotional scope that we never get to find out much about what makes him tick or really get to care for him. He is largely a non-entity for the whole film. In addition, the film takes virtually no opportunities to have fun as a period piece, so there is no music from that era (presumably outside of the budget), plus there is no attempt to address issues such as the blatant sexism and racism of that era. Not a bad film, but an unambitious one."
" Nicely done.
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,9,"Now granted I have a shallow American education, so I'll pay this film my highest compliment: I actually paused it a couple of times to look up what the heck they were talking about. Ireland and its ""Troubles?"" You mean it's not all pubs and green valleys? I was intrigued and followed this with ""Bloody Sunday,"" and learned a lot.So yeah, a British soldier is alone outside hos area in Northern Ireland, and will he make it back safely. And what makes it work for me is not the docudrama handheld pace throughout the film, but the notion I could empathize with the characters he encounters, and wonder how I would react in their place. That's good filmmaking.I have no idea who any of these actors are, and there were moments I had to ""instant replay"" some scenes so I could caption the dialog. #firstworldproblems At the very least, an educational & enlightening film for me."
" gripping thriller
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,9,"Noticing one reviewer's criticism of the accents, I wonder what film they watched. Nearly all the Irish characters are played by Irish actors, and from the cast list, many or most of those look to be from Northern Ireland. To my ear the accents are spot on, which they would be. Of all things to criticise, that's not one.Great acting throughout, a brilliant soundtrack that keeps you on the edge of your seat without even realizing there is a soundtrack. Shot in a way that makes you feel part of the action. A good job with the film settings. The Divis Flats were demolished in 1993 but the filming location used was a good replacement.Well worth watching ."
" '71: Solid
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,7,"Jack O'Connell puts in a great performance as an unseasoned British soldier trapped overnight in 1971 Belfast. With a real-time sense throughout the film you can really feel the soldier's immense distress: searching for a safe haven among enemies, guessing at neutral parties, maybe even sympathizers-but they're all rather indistinguishable dressed in their plain-clothes, as he's terrifyingly conspicuous in full battle-dress. '71 is deliberately understated which makes the young soldier's nighttime odyssey even more tense and more thrilling, especially when you're fully absorbed in it."
" Gripping and Tense
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,9,Quite a tense experience watching this film. Basically follows a new Army recruit through basic training to becoming stationed in Northern Ireland during the peak of the troubles. Really scary to imagine being lost in a Belfast not knowing who you can trust or turn to for help to get back to the barracks. Great acting in this film from the entire cast especially the lead soldier.
" Only just seen this
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,9,"I didn't bother with this film when came out in 2014. On watching this film my opinion of Jack o Connell being one of our best young actors is only more confirmed. The film had a good element of tension throughput and was a compelling watch. Just seen jungle land and it was another brilliant performance by Jack o Connell, I am starting to put him in the same league as James Pattinson and Tom hardy.
The confused mess that was Northern Ireland in that period is portrayed well and the conflicts and alliances between various factions were handled well and with authenticity.
Whilst there are obviously still hostilities and problems in Northern Ireland. The period in which this film is set was clearly an awful time for the people of Northern Ireland to live through and the plot being one new recruit to an infantry brigade and his experience on first deployment going terribly wrong and his subsequent encounters with different factions on his route to survival made a very good film.
Ps watch jungle land it's a great thriller with good acting and interesting plot."
" Absolute Madlad
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,7,"The film gave an extreme viewing experience and managed to establish a fierce impression. The shaky camera movement was not bothersome, thus, creates a room where viewers can feel the tension from the film. Jack O'Connell delivered a commendable performance where he did not need to spit a thousand words. Director Yann Demange's attempt to bring 1971 Belfast riot story into screen was brilliantly successful."
" amazing but at the same time ... meh
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,8,"In 1971, a young and disorientated British soldier is accidentally abandoned by his unit following a riot on the deadly streets of Belfast, what an idea. a crazy idea and it made me feel like I'm in there with the main character the actors were better than average. i enjoyed watching this film, but the thing is i cant give this film more than 8 because this film didn't represent something new like we have never saw before. but it's good."
" Gripping
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,6,Like most civil wars the Irish version is replete with ironies and tragedies without an ending in sight.
" '71 is Really an Awesome Film
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,8,"I have seen '71 online and liked every bit of this movie that takes us back to the years when Belfast was a war zone.The believable plot takes a new soldier into a hellish night alone, wounded and unable to find the way to his barracks.The dark photography set the tone perfectly throughout, delivering a sense of drama and unknown of what could happen.In addition, the acting, lead by fantastic actor Jack O'Connell could not be into any higher level. This movie - together with Jack's personification of real-life WW II hero Louis Zamperini in the movie Broken - must be some of his finest performances.I rated this wonderful thrilling urban war film with 8 stars out of 10. That fulfilling and bright i think it is.'71 is most definitely worth of your time"
" Superficial thriller that fails to substantially engage with its setting
",2020-07-09 00:00:00,5,"Based on the almost universally-favorable reviews of '71, I was looking forward to a film being sold as an intelligent thriller that takes place in a complicated setting, the streets of Belfast, riven by sectarian violence, in 1971. Having seen it, I'm still trying to figure out what inspired such praise.The best that '71 has to offer is British army private Gary Hook, played ably by Jack O'Connell, struggling desperately to survive when his unit leaves him behind in a Catholic neighborhood where her majesty's soldiers get little love. '71's pacing keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat, as Hook stumbles from frying pan to fire and back again, and its 100 or so minutes pass quickly. That works in the films favor, because it doesn't give the viewer too much time to think about what's happening on screen.Temporary suspension of disbelief may be a prerequisite for viewing any action film, but '71 crossed the boundary of plausibility so often that it takes away from the tension. I was not in Belfast in 1971, but I have spent time in an infantry unit, and the sequence of events that leads to Hook getting left behind is beyond preposterous.Another factor that makes the action mostly unbelievable is that, besides the protagonist and an ex-army medic who summarizes military life in the film's best line, none of the supporting characters seem real. They are two-dimensional characters of heartless terrorists, corrupt cops, jaded children, and green soldiers.Obviously, the Troubles is a touchy subject that is difficult to treat even-handedly; '71 simplifies the problem by just making almost everybody bad. If you're looking for a chase film, it's not hard to find one more believable than this, and if you want a movie about the Troubles, there are plenty that treat the subject with more intelligence and nuance."
" Very specific
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,5,"I did not about the events that the movie talk about . maybe that the reason i felt zoned out most of the screening , although i enjoyed a lot of aspects , per example the little boy he was enigmatic and his death was devastating .. and the lieutenant character was very poetic and the light in this dark story"
" Good account
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,9,"Great film .Ira vermin always played by out and out taigs too .And it's that lot that seem to get all the careers rewards in following on roles .
Sickening that Tony Blair bent over backwards to give them everything single thing they wanted .It now manifests in Scotland too with the sheer nepotism and corruption that goes on there .They truly did surrender"
" Good film, shame about a few things
",2020-05-21 00:00:00,7,"Really good film about the Troubles in Belfast, filmed mainly in my hometown of Sheffield. Only problems I found were a few of the props (the Burning Bus which appeared to be a Leyland Titan (sorry I'm a bus spotter) which wasn't introduced until 1977, where this film is supposedly 1971)Other than little details like that and being able to recognise Sheffield scenes being portrayed as Belfast (Divis Flats was really Park Hill Estate) it was a very enjoyable film"
" 7+1 STARS
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,8,"A really gritty, sad, realistic war movie giving a glimpse of the horrors of the British Irish conflict and the internal Irish struggle. Duplicity, betrayal, terror, loyalty and humanity in its most awful form.A very good movie!!"
" I can't watch movies where every single character is just stupid
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,3,Every single character within the first 20 minutes was just stupid. From the lieutenant that says leave the riot gear behind to all the soldiers who let a kid run up and grab a gun to the soldiers who run after the kid but then don't defend themselves and leave their guns lying on the ground. It was just dumb. Soldiers are taught to grab their weapons instinctively. They don't just leave them lying on the ground constantly. And they would defend themselves I mean if it's a choice between firing that weapon and getting killed in your going to fire that weapon. You're not going to curl up in a little ball and let yourself be kicked to death. Unwatchable
" No One Reloads... ever....
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,5,This movie has some interesting plotlines... the lack of even the most basic techical aptitude though makes this hard to watch. During the initial killing and escape scene thebpursuer fires 32 times without reloading.. with pistol.. in 1971... cmon!!!! Later gun battles also all are fought with more ammo than a finger pistol... fonzie jumping the shark sadly... it coulda been a contender.
" Best Military Movie I've Ever Seen
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,10,Probably the most realest military movie I've seen to date.
" Boring, snooze fest
",2020-03-13 00:00:00,5,"Was way to boring, it just never hooked me. The film wasn't even that long but it felt two plus hours. There was a few sloppy scenes that should have been retaken. The acting from some of the extras was horrendous. Jack O'Connell was the stand out in this but that was obvious."
" Bad
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,1,One sided garbage propaganda. Yes good acting and blah blah yet it's designed to shape minds. Wake up. The British were simply in the wrong place for a very long time. Killing many and making films like this...Why not a real IRA sided film? Honestly??? History as always is written by the victors blah blah.(DRESDEN???)
" Stunningly good thriller with an authentic eye of '70s Belfast to boot.
",2020-01-11 00:00:00,9,"In 1971, during the early stages of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, Gary Hook (Jack O'Connell) is a young British soldier whose regiment is sent to Belfast to deal with the violence. On his second day he is sent to a Catholic Nationalist area to assist the RUC in a search for illegal weapons. The locals' protest soon devolves into a small but violent riot. In the confusion Hook's regiment accidentally leaves him behind. Hook finds himself a British soldier in a Republican area, hunted by the IRA as he makes his way through Belfast during a typical Northern Irish night of rioting, shooting, and bombing. '71 makes effective use of ""shaky cam"" to give a heightened sense of realism. The audience is kept on high alert, much like the characters. The riot scene in the beginning, while not nearly as graphic or gruesome, really reminds me of the Omaha Beach scene in Saving Private Ryan. In addition to being an exceptional thriller '71 gives us a more than authentic view of the Troubles. Elements such as the sectarian division between Protestants and Catholics (the root of the conflict), the illicit collusion between British security forces and unionist paramilitaries, the constant threat of paramilitaries of both sides, and the common toll the Troubles took on the people of Northern Ireland are all explored with great authenticity without it becoming a documentary. It goes without saying but a good historical film has to maintain true to historical fact while remaining entertaining. As '71 is primarily a thriller rather than something like The Longest Day or Tora! Tora! Tora! one might assume that the film forgoes authenticity but it doesn't. '71 comes highly recommended both as a thriller and for anyone wanting a good movie about one of the most haunting chapters in recent British history."
" Film good. Fighting bad.
",2019-12-26 00:00:00,7,"I remember recording this on the telebox years ago and having it sit on the planner for months before eventually deleting it unwatched. What a bloody stupid thing to do, giving up. No one gives up in 71. Whichever side you think is good or bad, this is a seriously intense depiction of the troubles in Ireland. Jack O'Connell plays a young British soldier abandoned on the streets of Belfast after a perceived simple botched mission. It's terrifyingly brutal, gunfire and bombs, not the Hollywood kind, but single shots in the face and explosions in pubs that blow the arms off children. The score and camera are so effective, you find yourself tighten as the minutes pass by in what is a simple story, with a lot of underlying twists that winds up in a general sickening mess. Yes there are sides, but the film blurs them and doesn't take sides. If anything it's anti-conflict full stop, ""Posh c&nts, telling thick c&nts, to kill poor c&nts"". No happy endings, no enlightenment to reason, no answers. Just a sinking into darkness. The film is great. Fighting isn't."
" A Good Watch
",2019-11-08 00:00:00,8,I assigned this to my students to learn about the conflict in Northern Ireland. I needed a film with enough action to hold their attention and enough substance to give them a feel for what happened. This did both. Highly recommend...
" Cannot make sense of so many critical reviews
",2019-10-22 00:00:00,8,"I cannot make sense of so many critical reviews. Two criticisms are made: 1) the plot gets convoluted as the film goes on; 2) it would be a good thriller if the director did not want to make political points.
The 'convulsion' is in the reality itself the film depicts, with the British army and intelligence playing both the role of third-party arbiter and of military hand of the unionist terrorists.
Funny to complain about the politics, since the film is not a thriller, but a political film. Maybe this criticism comes from unrepented supporters of the Unionists? Surely the film does not offer a favourable portrait of therm.
Excellent screenplay, acting, music. I give 8 and i am being not generous."
" '71 - Drama In Its Highest Form
",2019-10-20 00:00:00,8,"French Born director Yann Demange, has created as intense a drama as could be expected within a documentary style movie - etched out of a real life and death situation from the pathetic streets of civil war torn Belfast. The ridiculously contemptuous hatred of religiously opposed inhabitants - living at close quarters of each other - shows human foolishness at its gut wrenching ugliest. Demange's intelligent direction and refusal to over exaggerate, combined with Scottish writer, Gregory Burke's angst-ridden, believable script, ensures each nerve wracking situation propels the viewer on a breathlessly desperate journey of survival. At times it's difficult to keep up with the double and triple crosses (including inept mistakes) as each party pits itself against its assumed enemy.In the end of time all are reduced, without quarter, to fools of the saddest most ignorant order. Performances are of the highest order, and Tat Radcliffe's photography combines hand held camera shots that don't make the viewer feel nauseous, David Holmes pensive music score moves believably within the action. While laced with coarse language and violence its recommended for adults who admire thoughtful, hardnosed, true to life drama that tells it as it is - without dim-witted embellishments. It also thankfully, does not outstay its welcome."
" I felt like I was there along side him
",2019-10-16 00:00:00,7,"You know when you have a really nice meal and look back and wish you'd been a bit hungrier for it?This emotional power house about the stresses of war, where each side is morally questionable force to be reckoned with where one is glad for being around your own and the anger to the other side is incendiary.I want to call this more than a thriller. This doesn't really have a message beyond conveying the noise and confusion of sectarian violence that hits a nerve harder than MOST horror. Most.The main character is a bit simple but it's not really about him. We get a tense and uncompromising depiction of humanity at its most organized, it's most brave and its most horrible."
" A Fine Film About A Ridiculous War That I Am Totally Dispassionate About.
",2019-08-02 00:00:00,5,"The idea that Catholics and Protestants were having turf wars over pubs in the 20th century is so ludicrous to me that I had to wiki the subject. Indeed, they all found their tiny dogmatic differences to be too great to share a country together. I'm sure there are plenty of reviews on here by people that actually care about that war, but I don't, so I'll keep this short.Jack O'Connell played James Cook on 'Skins' (2006), and like most of the cast, he has been killing it ever since. This is another example of how he can carry a small cast for a 90 minute film.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

" A RELENTLESS,SAVAGE,GRITTY SURVIVAL THRILLER.
",2019-07-08 00:00:00,9,"'71 is a brutal,raw,relentless chase Thriller that's steeped in history,a real time of civil war on the gritty streets of Belfast.
British soldiers,mostly young are sent to try & keep the peace on the violent neighbourhood,Belfast streets that's on the verge of erupting in complete chaos,there's a scary atmosphere hanging over the beginning of this excellent Thriller,it's like violence is about to explode any minute.A New young raw recruit played by Jack O'Connell gets trapped behind enemy lines when a riot kicks off as the soldiers are patrolling the grimy streets,this is where things get very scary as this young soldier is on the run through the dangerous neighbourhood & is chased by violent thugs who want to kill him.Jack O'Connell gives an excellent panicked performance as he's pursued through unknown & dangerous territory.
Hunted & scared O'Connell runs into dangerous situations & sinister characters & the movie is about his survival,will he make it back alive?
'71 is a dark,gloomy,dreary looking film that's very reminiscent of films actually from the 1970's!!! The cinematography captures the dreary, depressing Belfast streets & the dark look that makes '71 down & dirty with lots of grit.The music is also excellent,it's exciting & synthesizer based that's creepy & unsettling like a John Carpenter score from the early 80's!!!
You hear the best synth score as the soldier is being chased down grimy ally-ways it's very tension-filled & scary.'71 is a chase Thriller that's made just like it's setting,a 70's feel,old school Survival Thriller that feels more real & scary because it's based on truth & those violent riots & bombings did happen!!!
A VERY well made GRITTY survival Thriller."
" A complex political conflict condensed into a gritty, emotional experience for both the characters and the viewer.
",2019-04-24 00:00:00,7,"Understanding the intricacies of the Troubles is by no means an easy task, but director Yann Demange has done an excellent job of presenting this conflict in '71. Demange made something of a name for himself on British television, directing the E4 horror series Dead Set and Channel 4 crime drama Top Boy, and this success has translated very well into a film with much larger political significance.The characters of '71 are very much forged by their on-screen experience. Little backstory is given to the protagonist, Gary Hook, portrayed by Jack O'Connell, yet he gives a compelling physical and visual performance with an almost empty script. The intimate, personal atmosphere of the film makes the political conflict much easier to grasp for the viewer and the diversity of the opposing factions and characters shines through with an excellent supporting cast.The only flaw I could find in the film is its difficulty in exploring the ""why"" behind the conflict we witness on our screens. This in itself may play into the story, however, as British soldiers expecting to be sent abroad found themselves much closer to home, in a conflict they themselves didn't fully understand.The Troubles are a criminally under-taught and under-represented period so '71 offers an intriguing glimpse into the unrest and disorder that regrettably continues to this day."
" A young soldier struggling to survive.
",2019-04-16 00:00:00,7,"In the dangerous streets of Belfast, a young British soldier is unwillingly left behind by his unit and has to survive in an extremely hostile environment. The plot is certainly interesting, nicely executed; acting-wise pretty much everyone did an alright job. It's remarkable how the crucial events which happen on the streets of Belfast unfold into gritty violence, plotting and scheming in such a malicious fashion. The hatred towards British military forces seem to be the main reason for these Northern Irish terrorists to act like savages and killers.The film has great moments of tension, and it shows both sides of the same coin in regards to how people decide to treat a complete outsider, whom many consider part of an oppresive apparatus, a threat, an invader of their homeland. Pvt. Gary Hook (Jack O'Connell in an excellent performance) is just a young man trying to make it out alive, he has luck and he has help, he's no superman. He's a wounded, tired soldier whom has menacing characters looking for him. Many of the scenes feel incredibly real, as if you were a part of it; that is a huge turning point, to be able to feel extremely close to the story, characters and events going on. Such a real film, it's not perfect, towards the end it gets a bit stiff, but it has many favourable things."
" Tense
",2019-03-27 00:00:00,7,"I don't know all the actual history here but the movie does a decent job giving the background. I like that it's not like an action movie, it was a guy just trying to survive. The main guy was naive and caught in a bad situation that's just trying to make it out. The best scenes for me are the beginning where the two get caught in the chaos behind the lines and the part where the boy saved the main character. The movie certainly did a good job showing the tenseness in every situation and I really think Jack O'Connell is turning into a heck of an actor. 7/10 good movie."
" A gripping, disorienting action thriller with a brain to match
",2019-03-12 00:00:00,7,"A dark, gripping and disorienting action thriller about a young British solider accidentally left behind by his colleagues during 'The Troubles'. It's a fabulous thriller, brilliantly capturing the central character's disorientation; and drill more deeply in to his enemies' than we might expect."
" The Streets Of Belfast
",2018-09-24 00:00:00,8,"I tend to avoid most celluloid representations of Northern Irish Troubles - the longest running terrorist campaign in Europe, costing approximately 3000 lives and hundreds of millions of pounds in property damage and displacement - as oversimplified, glossy and biast; The Devil's Own, The Jackal, The Sons of Anarchy (particularly the last) portray Belfast either as some kind of South Central Los Angeles, or a gaudy Roger and Hammerstein set, with preconceived
notions of The Troubles, and frankly unrealistically romantic portrayals of (usually Republican) paramilitaries.'71 offers a gritty change of direction and pace. Told from the bewildered (and bewildering) viewpoint of one Gary Hook (an excellent portrayal by Jack O'Connell), a young British Army private marooned in Belfast - he's still in the UK his mates are assured! - after a supposedly straightforward raid goes drastically wrong; we're sucked nto a grimy, claustrophobic race for survival; Gary's race is our race. Hotly pursued by a Provo hit squad, Gary soon learns shocking lessons about trust...Perhaps the thriller element does get somewhat overdone - not as much as Fifty Dead Men Walking, mark - but I was genuinely impressed at the attempt made to grasp the nettle of the turmoil in the early Seventies and break it down for the outsider; how often has the Official v Provisional split been discussed or portrayed in film? The Loyalists are mostly comic relief, but an attempt is made to portray them as real people...just like the ordinary Catholics who risk their lives to aid the stiken Gary.Sean Harris deserves a mention as the devious Military Reaction Force officer (a real undercover outfit) running numerous Protestant and Catholic players; and contrary to some reviewers, barricades and vigilante patrols were fairly common during the early part of the decade - did he never hear of Free Derry?This is an honest attempt to unravel the confusion of Ulster's tragedy for the perspective of a confused outsider, particularly a lone British soldier; it deserves praise for its insight and bravery."
" Relentless
",2018-09-23 00:00:00,7,"The Troubles in 1970's Northern Ireland are a fascinating time in history. With so many different sides and conflicts that it becomes to feel a little convoluted when reading up on it all. But '71 does a good job of just focusing on one specific soldier's story in the heart of Belfast. After his platoon gets separated after an intense riot, he is forced to spend a night alone in what is essentially a warzone, with some people wanting to kill him and others willing to help. As is true in real life, there are many different sides to the conflict, so at times it becomes hard to follow who is trying to help or hurt who, which I think is what Yann Demange was hoping for. In that way, it's a nice way to keep the audience on their feet, especially as the soldier, Gary Hook, is at his most vulnerable. The cast is incredible, direction is tight, and the result is thrilling from beginning to end.7.6/10"
" lost in Belfast
",2018-09-19 00:00:00,9,"In 1971, Belfast was in turmoil, the IRA had rapidly gained power and placed a terrorising front upon the city. Ensuing riots and angry mobs flooded the streets and control had to be regained. British forces were deployed to ensure some stability and safety, which is where our story begins. Infantryman Gary Hook, along with his regiment, are sent to Belfast on a mission to recover a diplomat, but not before a riot stands in their way. The growing mob's mentality develops into chaotic violence and the men are forced to retreat. All but Gary Hook, who, disorientated and lost, is left in the streets of Belfast to fend for himself.With Jack O'connell at the helm, you are sure to witness a performance full of nuance, intensity, and incredible impulse, which he delivers in every scene. French-born Director Yann Demange terrifically depicts the world that surrounds Gary Hook, as he encounters all sorts of horrifying obstacles just to survive, gracefully excogitating Belfast's people and it's exterior. The director is in fine form, showcasing detailed sequences (including a one shot track of an explosion in a pub which is unnervingly brilliant) that give this film a unique, contemporary shine. The rest of the cast do well, but this truly is Jack O'connels feature, and it might just be one of his finest performances to date."
" Too Confusing To Be A Classic Anti-War Film
",2018-06-27 00:00:00,9,"I give this anti-war gem 9 stars even though the various groups were not delineated enough to maintain clarity. The British Secret Service, I think, was involved as well as the IRA and the PIRA and supporters as well as the UDA, the RUC, and the British Army. I have friends in Belfast. I never visited, but I did spend time in Derry, and I lived in Armagh. My plans were to visit Omagh, but I left Ireland instead, missing the bombing by just a week or so (1998). This film shows, above all, humanity in the face of fearful hatred of 'the other.'"
" Loved it.
",2018-06-19 00:00:00,9,Great well made about the troubles in Ireland. Highly recommended.
" A taut, tense, mile-a-minute thriller.
",2018-05-16 00:00:00,8,"''71 (2014)' is a taut, tense thriller with an interesting back-drop and an unconventional survival plot. There's a keen focus on character here and the vast, often unexplored situation is seen through his eyes. This makes for a small-scale story with much larger implications, an examination of the wider situation without being too focused on it. The film is peppered with realistically brutal action and is remarkably tense throughout, keeping you on the edge-of-your-seat from start to finish. A nail-biting, mile-a-minute ride. 8/10"
" PIECE OF MEAT
",2018-04-22 00:00:00,8,"The film centers on new recruit Pvt. Gary Hooks (Jack O'Connell). It follows his training and then quickly the green recruit is sent to Belfast...why it's part of the same country. During a confrontation with the Catholic Irish, Hooks gets separated from his group where he is beaten and abandoned. He is reluctantly aided by some collaborators, while others hunt him like an animal. The film moves through questionable tactics and loyalties.The movie was a decent drama thriller. It doesn't dwell much on the politics of the situation.Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity."
" A well-made and very important movie, highly recommended
",2018-02-24 00:00:00,10,"A riveting and well-balanced story about an important subject. When I was a child in the 80ies, I was more afraid of the Red Army Faction than a nuclear bomb from the Russians (or US Americans) due to the cold war. Equally I was and have always been more touched by the bloody destructive struggle between the Northern Irish and the English than by WWII (and I am not at all saying that one is objectively worse than the other, I am just saying that mankind has committed so many unspeakable, horrible sins and crimes all over the millenia, it is ridiculous to focus on the bad Russians and bad Germans alone and forget all the horrid, disgusting rest - if we want to learn from history/the past, we have to include all of it, and unfortunately, Northern Ireland - or the Gaza strip - etc. are still not entirely at peace). And the movie (like many other great movies about this subject) makes clear why: neighbors/brothers/for the rest of the world pretty much members of the same nation hating each other so much, that some Irish (even children) do not hesitate to shoot defenseless English soldiers in the face without any scruples or remorse - yes rather with pride and joy. And the English did not behave any better, they were the invaders of course, I am not judging or picking one side, because both sides have acted awful and used violence and there is nothing worse than violence and throwing bombs -no matter if it happens in Europe, in Africa, or elsewhere, and spreading hate with words and accusations is not less bad/dangerous. So, in order to keep in mind, that there are problems worldwide and hate and violence never works but gets everybody killed or suffering, this is a great movie, highly recommended, balanced, gripping, and well-acted. And it shows how intransparent and chaotic these situations get (Irish fighting Irish, English fighting English) - operating with hate and aggression is just a mess and helps noone."
" A huge achievement, if so very, very sad...
",2017-10-27 00:00:00,10,"""71"" is under the direction of Frenchman Yann Demange, and that is only the right and proper distance from the subject, given the circumstances. But to achieve the level of insight that is on show here is no mean feat for ""a foreigner"", even if writer Gregory Burke presumably helped out with this.In contrast, I (like pretty much any British person beyond a certain age) came to this film as someone who has little distance to offer, above all as someone who sees the ordinary British soldier - the squaddie, the poor bloody infantryman from the shires (in the case of Jack O'Connell and his character Gary Hook that's Derbyshire) - as a genuine hero in every sense of the world. And that would hold true whether its the Alma or Waterloo, or World War I or the Falklands we're talking about. Happily, the film agrees with me on this (or I would have found it difficult to get very far with it), while it also reminds us at the outset, that - county regiment as this may ""only"" be - these are still the best and most professional and most-disciplined (which here also means superbly self-restrained) soldiers to be found anywhere. Trying to perform decently in impossible circumstances has been the lot of the British soldier for many a long year, but coming as close to this ideal as humanly possibly, the lads have won the respect of a great many of us.Officers and special forces or intelligence types get less favourable treatment here, and I can quite allow that, and all the more so given the bleak picture painted of ""Loyalists"" and Republicans alike, who are seen turning on their own (almost as much as each other) repeatedly and without hesitation.Indeed, given that (as the film reminds us several times), everybody here is also within the United Kingdom context, at some level everybody is turning on their own, as several surprisingly touching and affecting moments of regret at killing in the film make clear.To add to those nuances, there are even glimpses here of people trying to get on with semi-normal lives above and beyond the sectarianism. War zone this may be, but it has kids and schools and TV and some kind of normalised future within reach, as opposed to the slide into more and more of those ""Troubles"" that 1971 actually denoted.Ultimately the whole piece is then a tragedy, as was the real-life situation, but what this film achieves in concise storytelling is little short of miraculous. How to give the essence of that complex and miserable story by referring to the events of not much more than one day? One might have thought it could not be done, but the makers of ""71"" achieve it.There is not much fun to be had from this film, but its level of understanding and layered complexity is superb.Thank God we have a peace now, if a tenuous one, and most prices are worth paying to keep that. To realise what could conceivably again be lost, a look at ""71"" is enough of a reminder of awful times, primitive times, that do indeed need to be consigned to history.Watch ""71"" for all of these reasons, but also marvel at the art of those who made it."
" One of the best war action drama thrillers!
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,9,"It's been done so many times before, I didn't have high expectations going into this film. I have to now say, it's one of the best war action drama thrillers!This film is brilliant in every aspect; directing, screenplay, cinematography, editing and acting. My only critique would be some loose plot issues and I would have liked to see some more character development.Aside from that, a fun thrilling ride that is a must see film. It's a 9/10 from me."
" A movie you'll either love or hate
",2017-08-24 00:00:00,6,"I'm kinda split on this movie. I saw it a few years ago when it first came out.Much like a B-level movie, there's a lot of camera-work and what-not that distracts you. It doesn't really seem to connect with me for some reason. The story I found difficult to follow also. It kinda reminds me of Dawn of the Dead in that it seems there are continuity goofs and mistakes.In simple terms, this is a survival movie. That said, there are several parts that I found to be impactful. There is a scene where the British soldier, running away through a hostile section of Belfast, ends up at a pub with a small Protestant child who served as his guide, and his parents and other relatives are above the pub assembling a bomb. The soldier is in the pub when the bomb accidentally goes off outside, killing the child. Honestly, after a while I lost track of the movie due to boredom as it is very long. The pace also isn't consistent. Needless to say, there is a long-term antagonist that has been following the protagonist from early on in the movie. He isn't the one who initiated the survival run (it was a woman who disguised as a mother, plants a grenade on a group of soldiers, one of which is the protagonist, and makes it look like they are the bad guys, setting off a mob action on the soldiers). Rent if you wish, but only if you're dying of boredom."
" Redeeming Moments but Forgettable
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,5,"This movie had some raw, redeeming qualities, illustrating the brutality of a country torn apart by conflict. The action sequences were well directed, and the cinematography offered a sense of gritty realism. The realism of what the main character experienced was refreshing, but the overall lack of a clear story (start, middle, end), combined with underdeveloped characters, and unexplained events/relationships made for an underwhelming experience."
