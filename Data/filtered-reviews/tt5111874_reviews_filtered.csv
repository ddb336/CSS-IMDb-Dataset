" I love Louie, but...
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,6,"Ultimately this one fell flat. I'd seen three or four documentaries on Scientology before this one and had high hopes because I'm familiar with Louie's other work, but it was mostly covering old ground and a good amount of time is spent on reenactments of people's accounts of abuse. There are some interesting things for sure, but overall I felt like the Scientology people put up enough of a smoke-screen to foil Louie."
" I Would Have Preferred More Investigative Journalism
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,6,"I'll admit that I did not finish this, so maybe it's not fair to review it. But the first half of this documentary is more about the guy making a movie ABOUT scientology (holding a lot of casting calls of actors to play David Miscavige) than it is about a guy actually investigating scientology. I would have preferred the investigation angle more. It's kind of fun and if you like behind-the-scenes of moviemaking/acting, you might like this."
" Helpful to see the training for emotional controls
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,7,The actors learning session was Informational. That session also made the interaction with the cult members and Marty more transparent.
" Entertaining and funny.
",2020-09-15 00:00:00,8,"I like documentaries with Louis Theroux. He approaches his subjects with calmness and with a subtle humorous almost sarcastic touch and that's what makes it not only informative but also entertaining to watch. In this documentary he tries to approach The Church of Scientology, another crazy cult that has some famous members like Tom Cruise and John Travolta, both great actors but apparently complete nutters in real life. Because that's what you have to be, completely mad, to join a cult like this one. I'm an atheist myself but don't really mind what others think, even not crazy cults like this one. In my opinion people do and believe what they want as long as you leave other thinking people in peace. And it's a pity to see this is not the case with Scientology, where brainwashed morons get trained to intimidate people just for the joy of their supreme leader (I forgot his name and don't feel like checking it as he's just to insignificant to mention), a little bully they all fear for no reason other than being easily manipulated. I could not even be mad at a guy like that, I feel more sorry for all his blind followers, it's quite amazing how many dumb people get sucked into this madness. The documentary is well shot and mostly funny to watch, and that's not even because of Louis Theroux but because the response the Scientology members give. It's almost unbelievable grown-up people can act so childly, but I have to admit it's funny to watch (maybe a bit scary also for some people, even though I could not help it to break in tears from laughing if I ever was confronted to those lunatics). Catherine Fraser was the most funny to watch in this documentary, completely bonkers and acting like a petulant child that doesn't get her way, almost pathetic to watch. It's good Louis Theroux shows those images, those alone discredit their whole made-up religion, they just did it to themselves without even understanding they did that. As for Marty Rathbun, a former member that is now very bitter he wasted the majority of his life to that movement, he clearly also has something loose in his brain. Thank to him for showing us a bit what it was like inside there and how it all works, but avoiding the questions about the ""probably"" horrible things he did himself is showing a lack of full cooperation and for that he isn't fully credible, and that's a point for the Church of Scientology. But whatever it's still interesting to watch, but mostly funny. Another cult, another way of life, another bunch of idiots."
" Better Than Average Doc Film - My Scientology Movie
",2020-08-02 00:00:00,7,"I like Louis Theroux and am quite impressed by his amazing restraint and delicate hand in trying to penetrate the iron curtain of the the church of scientology. Of course, it was a futile effort, given the resources and power that the church employs in its home city. The church of scientology is not alone in its efforts to defend itself. They seem to be in the same position as the Catholic Church, whose sex offenders against youth are the actions of a minute percentage of the church, but does not diminish all the good things that the Catholic Church does. Whether or not the church of scientology performs as many good actions as the Catholic Church is a matter of debate, and left to the judgement of the reader. However, the documentary did provide some knowledge not generally previously known by the public, so, to that extent, it was a valuable contribution.
So, is the church of scientology an evil empire cult, or are they a positive force of good in the world? Most likely, like all draconian choices, the answer lies somewhere in the middle. I liked Tom Cruise's performance in Magnolia, which I gave a great review, but this is not a movie; it is a documentary, and Tom Cruise is really not the focus of the film. The real focus is on the leader of the church, and the conclusion is that he, too, is somewhere in between the saint or sinner category. Mr. Theroux was fearless in his determination to get the film made, and for that he gets two extra stars. But for content, I was not able to add any additional stars because by the film's end we know just about as much of the church leader as we did before the film. My own personal impression is that this church is a very expensive pyramid scheme that pays off very well for those who stick with it for an extended period of time, but I could be wrong. As a philosophical Taoist, I tend to cultivate the middle rather than the extremes, and it is fairly obvious to me that this church cultivates the extremes in many cases, with a great emphasis on worldly goods and money. I look forward to Mr. Theroux's next film."
" Going Clear was so much better
",2020-07-05 00:00:00,3,"I didn't really understand the point of spending so much time trying to find the right actors to reenact scenes, and them then spending half of the movie trying to perfect their acting - I get it..but it all felt unnecessary.
Some good moments, but overall dissappointed - Going Clear was a much more insightful doco."
" Horrible, and painful to watch
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,2,"My first thought was that the only thing I learned was that this guy doesn't know how to make a documentary. But he apparently has some reputation beyond this work so I'll reserve judgment. I watched with someone else, and neither of us could figure out what Louie was trying to say. It's so disjointed and frustrating as a result. There's what seemed like a full minute of him and his primary ex-Scientologist subject just staring at each other. Most awkward minute in cinematic history. All the casting footage for just a few small bits of acted-out scenes was bizarre. Just watch Clear. There's nothing new to see here unless you enjoy multiple 5-10 minute shots of Louie saying the same thing over and over to a Scientologist security person who says the same thing over and over to him when we all know they can't be reasoned with and won't listen to him."
" Louis needs to be a little bit more compassionate
",2020-02-05 00:00:00,9,It's a good documentary really opened my eyes to the lies of scientology and how crazy they are and also understand a little on how they are misled to believing this crap and get stuck but there's times Louis needs to be a little more chill and understanding instead of asking dumb questions especially to someone who's not getting paid and helping him a lot without Marty Rathbun this film would be nothing and when they bring his kids into and Louis starts coming at him it ticked me off
" Good doco on this cult (so-called 'religion')
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,8,"This is another good Expos√© on the cult of scientology. It's sad that people get brainwashed like this. Louis Theroux's very mild 'investigation' caused the paranoid Scientology machine to issue threatening legal letters, to film Louis & his team when he is near their HQ, AND when he's back in his LA studio, to deny them access to public roads, and to call the police on them several times for 'trespassing' (which they were not doing).
Definitely not the reactions of a kind & helpful 'church' (yet they are still able to be classified as a 'religious organisation' in most countries and hence retain their TAX- FREE status!).
Well done Louis!"
" Great doc
",2019-11-05 00:00:00,9,Not quite like Louis Theroux's other programmes. I'm interested to know what compelled Louis Theroux to apply a mainstream format in This documentary in comparison to his other work. He did a lot of piece to cameras and reenacted the Scientology experience with actors. Loved this doc.
" If you don't know what Scientology is, Heavily recommended
",2019-10-23 00:00:00,7,"Haven't been siked to watch a documentary in a while but this has rejuvenated my wanting to learn, Louis creates a great narrative and actually puts himself in interesting situations with the church. Would recommend this if you know nothing about Scientology or just want to watch a doc"
" GETTING IN THE CENTER OF A STORY
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,8,"By now most people are well aware of the stories that revolve around Scientology, a new age religion that's found promoters in the form of actors like Tom Cruise and John Travolta. Created by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard the religion believes that its followers are reincarnated over and over and eventually will be met by aliens who placed them here to begin with centuries ago.Much has come out on the group via two main sources, the book and film GOING CLEAR and the series hosted by ex-Scientology member Leah Remini. Both have provided tons of information about the religion and the monetary aspects of it, where members basically pay thousands of dollars for books and classes, as well as potential slavery and criminal activity that has yet to be proven. So the thought that another documentary on the topic would come about was a natural.Documentary filmmaker Louis Theroux decided to do just that. But rather than pursue the topic in the normal documentarian fashion he tried something different. With limited or zero access to the sites and people involved in Scientology, they are a rather secretive group unless they control every aspect of an interview, he sets about hiring actors to portray various members or ex-members recreating scenes that have taken place and are documented about things that have happened.As a technical advisor he gets the assistance of ex-Scientologist Mark Rathbun. Rathbun was a former senior executive for the organization and was the Inspector General of the Religious Technology Center (RTC), the group in charge of the protection and enforcement of all things Scientology. In this role he was central in ruining the lives of anyone who dared speak ill of Scientology as well as taking people to The Hole, a compound surrounded by barbed wire and with high security equipment that prevents people from escaping.As the film progresses the relationship between Theroux and Rathbun becomes central to what is taking place in the auditions and re-enactments being shot. Rathbun knows the reality of what took place but Theroux only knows what he's been told. The pair become exasperated with one another at several points but work toward a common goal.Much of Theroux's attitude changes when he begins to actually see the tactics used against him by the Church of Scientology. Suddenly he's being followed and filmed by members of the group. They appear outside the studio where he is filming the re-enactments, shooting footage of him and anyone who enters the building. A stalker like system of following him, a campaign intending to smear him and the film he's working on, threats of being arrested and more begin to make Theroux realize that there was perhaps more truth to what he's been told by Rathbun than he realized.The film is interesting for taking a different tact than others about the same topic. Denied permission to shoot inside any of the centers for Scientology or to interview members Theroux ended up talking to those who left and found out their stories were identical enough to be true. Couple that with his treatment and one has to wonder why anyone would join the organization. Using what techniques he has at his disposal to tell the story it becomes and interesting cautionary tale about the group and how they treat anyone who questions them. In all it adds yet another chapter in the story of this organization that should make folks wonder about the true motives behind it."
" The irony of being more insane than the insane group you are making a documentary about.
",2019-04-21 00:00:00,1,"Horrible.There was a certain scene that ruined this for me and exposed the film makers as being worse than the group they are 'investigating'. There was a woman in public with a single camera man and the director of this film pesters her with questions. She doesn't have to answer them and is obviously not comfortable.He persists and follows her around, he then pesters her cameraman with questions. When she says she wants to leave he chases her down and starts yelling at her to come back and to stop running away. What a psycho.The camera pans out and you see the scene unfold. The director has a crew of camera men and sound guys so he has a party of about five, chasing a woman who is with a single cameraman and minding her own business but since she may work for the Scientologists she MUST be crazy right?If someone is going to make a movie about how certain religious groups harass, manipulate and stalk others perhaps they should not conduct those behaviors themselves.Creep director, who harasses apparent 'harassers'. The apparent 'harassers' being 5'2 quiet blonde women. Ridiculous."
" One of Theroux's best
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,8,"This was a new take on documentary and something I've never personally seen before yet it still manages to work fantastically well. The re-enactments and 'staged' elements are well balanced and it was good to get an insight to how the world of film works. Also in all honesty the subject matter is ridiculously interesting with so many different angles and faces of those involved, quite possibly one of the most entertaining documentaries I've seen and I highly recommend this gem"
" Them be crazy, we know
",2017-11-05 00:00:00,6,"Interesting in parts. Humorous in parts. Why we needed to see wannabe actors auditioning for scenes that don't end up featuring in the film? No idea. If it was meant as a substitute for material that they knew they wouldn't get, then it I'm afraid it failed.They had so little access, unsurprisingly, that it didn't really teach us anything we didn't already know. The 'squirreling' isn't a revelation, I think most of us have seen film of middle aged saddos trying to wind leavers up. Some of the old footage was interesting but Louis didn't add to that library. The film did succeed in showing Marty's colours, this former Church 'muscle' objected to being reminded of his hypocrisy by Louis after the Church made veiled threats, who knows what he actually did. Felt Louis ducked that one though, afraid of losing his best subject. In fact, the whole thing lacked daring.Ultimately, not very satisfying. Might be a good for somebody who has lived under a rock and doesn't know anything about the Cult and their crazy folk."
" If The Church of Scientology is so Benevolent and Caring Why Do They Act So Guilty?
",2017-10-13 00:00:00,7,"If there's anything I gleaned from this film, it's that the people in the Church of Scientology seem to be anything but compassionate and open. Vindictiveness appears to be their modus operandi. The film is an improvised documentary in which spontaneous encounters demonstrate the twisted world of the Church of the Scientology. Even those among the Church of Latter Day Saints, i.e. the Mormons, were more magnanimous about the musical ""The Book of Mormon"". PBS did an expos√© on the Mormons in which many Mormons and ex-Mormons were interviewed. To their credit they didn't seem to be frightened some skeletons would be unearthed from their closets, although they did draw the line in terms of allowing outsiders access to their ceremonies inside their temples. (They did offer some footage showing the inside of one temple without people.) By contrast, the Church of Scientology doesn't merely decline; they literally put up roadblocks in public areas near some of their facilities! They have continually rejected to participate in any kind of documentary about them. They won't give interviews, they dislike outsiders questioning their practices, and they seem most loath to let anyone research their history. If former members claim any kind of shortcoming or social infraction, large or small, they are labeled as liars and transgressors.In one of their most telling responses to allegations of impropriety at the hands of David Miscavige, the Church's absolute ruler, the Church claimed that any such allegations ""were extremely false."" I didn't know there were gradations of falsifications! I thought something was true or untrue. Saying that such allegations were ""extremely false"" seems to me a red flag that something must be true. Of course they offer no explanation as to why someone who left the Church might make such accusations, except to call them all liars. Interestingly, so many of ex-Scientologists make the same accusations. It must be a conspiracy to threaten the survival of the Church. Of course, such accusations if proved true will threaten the survival of the Church! Is there an irony here? The writer, producer and narrator, Louis Theroux solicits the help of Mark ""Marty"" Rathbun, a former inner-circle ""cabinet"" member whose job had been to protect the doctrine, essentially both from within and without. During the documentary, Rathburn claims he not only witnessed but participated in punishments upon members who had transgressed against either the Church itself or its leader David Miscavige. One of their main punishments was to humiliate ""guilty"" members in front of others. A bigger punishment was to send transgressors to ""The Hole"", a kind of Scientology detention center. He says he also engaged in harassment of outsiders whom Miscavige believed might undermine the Church's mission. Rathburn then found himself on the receiving end of such discipline and promptly left the Church. Members who leave the Church and criticize it are labeled PTS (Potential Trouble Sources) and SP (Suppressive Persons). As far as I could tell, Rathburn has been labeled both.Aside from Rathburn, the really telling scenes are the confrontations between Theroux with people who refuse to identify themselves but are clearly acting under orders from the Church. During one such conflict, the filmmakers come to the outskirts of a Scientology outpost called ""The Hole"" where Rathburn and other ex-Scientologists claim punishments have been enacted. They don't enter private property but are simply on a public street near a sign which says ""Road Closed"". They are immediately confronted by Scientology ""guards"" who order them to disperse as if they have governmental authority. Theroux counters that they are on a public road, and they have a permit to film. A woman who confronts the filmmakers won't even look at the permit, but simply keeps reiterating they have must leave or face criminal consequences. It should be pointed out that no non-governmental civilian has the authority to arrest someone outright except in the event of a felonious crime, a.k.a. a citizen's arrest. Trespassing is not a felony, probably only a misdemeanor in California. If they were truly egregiously trespassing, they should have called the police, not confront the trespassers and threaten them with arrest.During every confrontation, the Scientologists and gatekeepers won't engage in a discussion but either claim they are being trespassed upon or simply remain silent. Another former member explains that their behavior is to impress David Miscavige, an audience essentially of one. The other aspect of the documentary is auditioning actors to play key roles of the prominent members, primarily David Miscavige and Tom Cruise, probably the most famous Scientologist on the planet. In the irony of ironies, every confrontation scene just proved to me over and over again that the Church of Scientology is clearly guilty of the things of which they are being accused. It's like the person harboring illegal weapons in their house who refuse to let their house be searched without a warrant. My first thought is, what are they hiding and being so adamant about their secrecy?"
" As always, Louis Theroux is cool as an English cucumber
",2017-09-20 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed this, even though I am learning a lot more about the abuses of the ""church"" or scientology through Leah Remini's and Mike Rinder's series on A&E (highly recommended).I have always like everything LT does. He's like a high functioning Aspie who doesn't mind or get bothered by confrontation. I wish he would have participated in an auditing session (where you sit and hold the cans) and filmed it, but the way he had different scenes remade was interesting too. The kid cast as Miscavige was pretty spot-on, and a bit frightening in the Hole scene.No, the only thing I didn't enjoy was Mark Rathbun. I think he has issues and needs some help. His volatile nature made him an unlikeable victim of a cult, and that's a shame, because he IS a victim.Anyway, good job by LT on making this an interesting look at a scary subject."
" A Nice Supplemental
",2017-08-03 00:00:00,7,"Louis Theroux documents his investigation into what goes on behind the scenes of the infamous Church of Scientology.As of right now (2017), there are two big documentaries on Scientology. This one, and the one made by HBO. Frankly, the HBO one is a bit better and definitely a must-see. This one is also good, and while it covers much of the same ground, it does go into other areas, too. Theroux, to his credit, seems to have very little fear of being arrested and gets some great footage near the base.This film does have some strange narrative devices, such as casting actors in the roles of real Scientologists and then having them act out events that allegedly occurred. One scene in particular (in ""the hole"") is very effective. The casting of ""Tom Cruise"", unfortunately, never seems to go anywhere."
" Not too bad
",2017-07-25 00:00:00,8,"This movie was not too shabby. I like how they call out the church of Scientology for not joining the documentary and also, for calling out the violence the church of Scientology is known for. I like how they call out religion for charging for everything and how much money you can end up spending. And using the primitive e meter machine that used to be a lie detector test. I completed their Scientology stress tests and noticed how money hungry these guys were for me to buy their book by L Ron Hubbard. Religion is clearly a problem and one thing about this movie that was incorrect was saying that Scientologists do not have a god even though they believe in an overlord named Xenu that sent us humans to Earth. Which is a completely ridiculous story. When we jump back to the money hunger I think needed to have spent more time on the fact that to be a top Scientologist member you would have to drop as high of two million dollars. One thing I noticed about religions in these documentaries is that they always follow you around in a suspicious car to see what you're doing. It was also terrifying to hear that many people have had worse experiences for trying to liberate themselves. Also, the verbal abuse and verbal insults show how religion is a very strong case of brainwashing. This movie was insanely terrifying to see the religious act like this over another load of crap religion. I do think the way it ended was crap."
" Amazingly low energy and dull
",2017-07-24 00:00:00,3,"The biggest problem with this documentary from Louis Theroux is that it is very, very low energy...and other documentaries have covered this same fascinating material and infused it with more energy and passion. My advice is to try one of these other films, such as Leah Remini's very passionate and personal series about the same subject, ""Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath"". However, instead of hearing folks talking about their own personal experiences, often Theroux recreates scenes or talks with very little energy or enthusiasm...which is strange because he CAN make amazing films on cults, such as his seemingly heartfelt films on the infamous Fred Phelps cult ""The Most Hated Family in America""--and the best film about the Westboro Baptist Church and their hate-filled protests. I have almost always loved Theroux's films...but this one is clearly the exception and I wish he just hadn't bothered."
" Really disappointing, shallow look at a complex issue
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,5,"I was really excited for this film, having liked Theroux's previous titles, and having had the cult of scientology as bit of a morbid fascination for a number of years. With the number of titles coming out about the topic - HBO's Going Clear & Leah Remini's TV series - this film should have been much better than it was. It was jumbled, boring, repetitive, and lacked focus. Is this a movie about Marty Rathbun, about David Miscavige, is it just a collection of filmed encounters with angry Scientologists? I feel like Louis Theroux went into this knowing just about nothing about Scientology and got too distracted by their bizarre - but typical - harassment to make the film he intended to make. There are literally hundreds of videos online of people being harassed by Scientologists, that's what they do. It's not worth as much time as he devoted to it in the film. I would have preferred a movie about David Miscavige - you didn't even mention his missing wife! - as told by Marty Rathbun. Disappointed!"
" Over-Promises, Under-Delivers
",2017-07-20 00:00:00,4,"This has got to be one of the most disappointing movies I've seen and when it was over my mouth was literally agape at just how bad it was. I should preface this by saying that I am an absolute HUGE fan of Louis and my disappointment was amplified because I was hoping (expecting) to see something on par with his previous work. The film is stilted, disjointed, and feels poorly thought out. The lack of any real new material forces the crew to constantly cut back to the half-baked casting calls and 're- enactments' which never make sense and don't serve much, if any, purpose. The crew seem to set out with no real goal but to create a studio version of Scientology for Louis to take part in. That never comes to fruition, which is a good thing because it was a terrible idea in the first place and a horribly weak cornerstone to place the framing of the film on. Normally I find Louis' mode of interviewing very interesting- his characteristic long pauses and 'innocent' way of questioning his subjects through absolute frankness makes for surprisingly revealing answers, but here it just feels deliberately insulting. At one point in the film, a major player and ex-Scientologist is harassed by some members and is visually upset. Instead of using this to push the ex-Scientologist to another level, Louis instead decides to needle him some more with a not completely unnecessary but unbelievably poorly timed question.Pointless and disappointing are two words that immediately came to mind after finishing this film. Right near the end, the ex-Scientologist that was harassed insinuates that the gloves are coming off; I finally got excited, expecting some big revelations from this man, only to have the credits roll. This film set out with no goal and ends exactly that way- accomplishing nothing."
" why do people join?
",2017-06-12 00:00:00,6,"Greetings again from the darkness. Here's hoping Tom Cruise doesn't hunt me down, and that a group of believers doesn't shout insults at me in an airport; but I'll admit that the more I learn about the Church of Scientology, the more creeped out I get. Director John Dower and BBC reporter Louis Theroux do nothing to put me at ease or even help understand how people fall for this ""religion"" ¬Ö a self-described ""universal solvent"".Yes, Scientology is a religion that was founded by a science fiction writer. The genre has seen many popular writers over the years - Ray Bradbury, Arthur C Clarke, H.G. Wells, and Philip K Dick were all great writers, and some were read religiously by their fans. However only one, L Ron Hubbard, had the pluck to actually start a religious cult and consider himself God's conduit. His 1950 book ""Dianetics"" is known as Book One and the foundation for the movement that became Scientology.Mr. Hubbard died in 1986. Twenty-something David Miscavige took control and to this day remains the mysterious leader of the organization. His one TV interview was in 1990 with Ted Koppell on ""Nightline"" and he has since refrained from public appearances ‚Äì a stance that has only enhanced the weirdness and rumors surrounding Scientology. Instead, public figures like Tom Cruise and John Travolta have become the faces that people associate with the organization, and have been influential in recruiting efforts.The extremely polite Theroux takes an unusual approach to this and actually holds auditions for the key roles of David Miscavige and Tom Cruise, with the plan to reenact some of the more infamous ongoings behind the secure walls of Scientology. When the open call for participants hits social media, warnings to Theroux start flooding in ‚Äì literally cautioning him to stay away from this subject. Undeterred, though maybe a bit shaken (is Paz de la Huerta a bikini-clad spy?), he enlists Marty Rathbun, a former senior leader in Scientology. He bolted after 27 years, and the organization now labels him as an embittered SP (Suppressive Person) and works to discredit everything he says.Andrew Perez wins the role of Miscavige by expressing the necessary level of ""righteous anger"" according to Rathbun. The reenactments of Miscavige speeches, the E-meter sessions, and bull-baiting (belittling to build backbone) provide us a simulated peek behind the cloak of secrecy. We learn about The Celebrity Centre, Gold Base, and The Hole ‚Äì each adding to the creepiness that is difficult to shake.Three other former Scientologists are interviewed: Tom De Vochts, Marc Headley and Jeff Hawkins. It's through them that we learn about Sea Orgs ‚Äì the most devoted of those within the organization. There is also a fascinating tie-in with Mr. Hawkins' wife Catherine Frazier, who not only remains an active Scientologist, but plays a key role in one of Theroux's contentious interactions on a road that is either public or private, depending on whom you ask.Alex Gibney's Going Clear documentary stands in contrast to Theroux's almost playful approach to getting information and details out of those who were/are there. Although the playfulness disappears when, late in the film, Theroux confronts Mr. Rathbun on his role in building the structure that he now condemns. We know we can't trust the ""church"", but we (including Theroux) are never quite sure whether to trust Rathbun, or if he is merely out for revenge. It's rare that a true story can provide such comical moments and yet, at its core, provide such frightening insights. Call it a cult, a religion, an organization, or any other label you prefer ¬Ö it's still just plain creepy."
" Disappointingly Pointless
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,3,"I have always found the subject matters of Louis documentaries to be fascinating, but his interview ""technique"" seems to be standing silently looking rather puzzled & having nothing insightful to ask or say. This documentary is probably his finest example of that technique. Despite having unfiltered & unrestricted access to one of the most interesting & high ranking ex members of this destructive cult, Louis failed to ask even one interesting or revealing question. He only succeeds in upsetting & compromising his subject, with his complete lack of intelligence or understanding. The entire film revolves around trying to produce an ""improvised"" scene that only might have happened, & the only location scouted was an access road to the back of Gold Studios. Considering the access Louis had to such high ranking Ex members & his undoubted knowledge on the subject (just listen to his interview on the Joe Rogan podcast to understand the in depth research he has completed on the subject), the entire film fails to either make any revelations, or give us any insight into this insidious cult, that we don't already know. So... disappointing & vacuous...no surprise there then."
" Theroux investagates by not investigating
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,1,"The only problem with the whole film is using stock footage of Scientology meetings.There is no actual investigation,except to ""simulate"" what happens with ex members.But by far the worst aspect of the film is that struggle really hard to actually make something controversial.Its more theatre if peoples natural persoanlities."
" Nothing really new, but worth watching
",2017-03-21 00:00:00,7,"Exposing Scientology has become something of a genre unto itself, and this doesn't really break any new ground. There are the usual stories of coercion, confrontations and creepy interactions we've come to expect from Scientologists. If you've seen Going Clear, the Leah Remini series, or even the South Park episode, you won't learn anything you didn't know.Still, he manages to keep it interesting. The most unique thing he does is hire actors to play out various scenes, with guidance from former Scientologists - mostly Mark Rathbun, the former ""Inspector General of the Religious Technology Center"". Particular emphasis is given to correctly capturing the explosive temper of David Miscavige.The biggest weakness in the movie is that Mark Rathbun is kind of an annoying guy. Whereas most former Scientologists are contrite about their own behavior in the cult, he really doesn't take ownership of his past at all. He continuously complains about the abusive tactics the Church uses against him and his family, but whenever Theroux politely points out that he certainly did similar things in the past, he goes into a snit. Weirdly, one of the things that seems to bother him the most is that the Church doesn't acknowledge what a ""big shot"" he was.Not a bad way to pass a couple hours, but not likely to be remembered for long."
" An unfortunate and speculative disappointment.
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,4,"Firstly let me say that I am a big fan of Louis Theroux's work, this however I find to be a rather large disappointment.The crux of the failings all comes down to a lack of access to the church itself, this meant that other than the odd scene where he meets someone from the church - who is usually telling him to leave the area - he has to rely on the testimony from spurned ex-members. I'm sure you can see just how unreliable these testimonies are; these people have either been cast out by the church or left under questionable circumstances and will have an 'axe to grind' against them meaning they could be all too happy to exaggerate and make up certain elements in order to smear the church for their revenge. However we then go from bad to worse. What Theroux does with these testimonies is to hire actors to create a mock up scenario based on the claimed experiences of former members. This scenario shows the church as extremely abusive, controlling and cult-like, however it also has all the professionalism of a warm up activity for a failing local amateur dramatics society. And whilst I agree that there is some strange and twisted stuff going on inside the Scientology religion, the whole way through I was unable to take the dramatic reconstruction seriously, as every detail of it was secured from people who had a reason to both hate and discredit the church. There are some good points to the documentary, the interviews with ex-members and brief run-ins with current members do contain some fascinating details, stories and theories. Should these be true, the church is even more twisted than I had dared to imagine. The way in which the current members treat Theroux and any of his team shows just how secretive they are which does beg the intriguing question of what are they hiding?In this review, I have slated Theroux's approach quite badly, I do however appreciate that there was most likely no alternative. The Church is famous for their refusal to communicate openly with those outside of its tight-knit community and Theroux is too famous now to get away with going undercover, from what we do see of the Church members in here, it is clear that they would have busted him on day one. So to conclude, all in all it isn't the worst documentary in the world but by no means is it anywhere near the best. The information that the entire thing is based upon could be both flawed and biased and is certainly unreliable. If you can look past this you will enjoy it more than I did. If not, then like myself, you will most likely watch this movie with a heavy sense of scepticism and come the end, be unsure as to whether to believe every word of it or none at all."
" Funny and entertaining, but lacking originality and insight
",2017-01-30 00:00:00,5,"It was only a matter of time before BBC documentary film-maker Louis Theroux made the leap from the small screen to the big. With his unique brand of investigative journalism and interview techniques, as well as a splash of oddball charm, Theroux managed to put his subjects at ease in his presence and allow them to reveal startling inner truths. Much like Werner Herzog, he is fascinated by the weird, and seemed to carry weirdness with him wherever he goes (within minutes, Theroux randomly comes across a bikini-clad Paz de la Huerta who offers her services for the film). So when he announced that his next focus would be on the closed-off world of scientology, it didn't come as much surprise. However, the timing of it did.A decade ago, the majority of the general public may have only heard the term 'scientology' in relation to Hollywood stars such as Tom Cruise and John Travolta, but many were unaware of just how bizarre and brutal their beliefs and institutional set-up truly is. A hilarious and enlightening episode of South Park later, combined with Alex Gibney's revelatory and in-depth feature-length documentary Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief (2015), and the lid has been lifted on David Miscavige and his rule of tyranny. Does Theroux have anything new to say on the controversial 'religion'? Not at all. In fact, the only thing saving his debut feature from being a complete misfire is the way he approaches the subject, along with some genuinely spooky imagery.Rather than regurgitating Gibney and with the knowledge that he was going to get nowhere with the incredibly secretive organisation, Theroux has chosen to hire actors to play out archive interviews of Miscavige and Tom Cruise in the hope of persuading former Scientology enforcer Marty Rathbun (who accompanies Theroux for most of the film) to open up about his experiences. This technique was so successfully and devastatingly used in Joshua Oppenheimer's The Act of Killing (2012), but Rathbun remains a frustratingly closed-off figure, and eventually flips when Theroux asks one probing question too many. The most entertaining scenes involve Theroux's clashes with various members of the group but they offer little other than to remind just how loopy these people are. John Dower's film is certainly funny and entertaining, but lacking originality and insight (although I feel I must highlight the performance of Andrew Perez as Miscavige, who is electrifying)."
" Typically interesting, but nothing we didn't already know
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,7,"I've been a fan of Louis Theroux since his humble TV documentary-making beginnings of the early nineties. Without exception I've enjoyed every small screen outing he's produced. Therefore, I was pretty damn excited when I found his latest (and first) big-screen topic was about none other than one of the most talked about subjects of the modern age ‚Äì scientology.It's one of the fastest-growing religions, mainly in America, but its churches have been spreading across the world at a steady rate. Now, the thing about scientology that most people seemed so bemused about, is its secrecy. If I wanted to know about any other world religion, I could probably go into any library or bookstore and pick up a text on how it worked and what it was based on, i.e. the bible for Christianity. The ‚Äì dare I say ‚Äì 'problem' with scientology is that no one really speaks openly about what it's all about, leaving much speculation.The church itself often doesn't do interviews, meaning all we ‚Äì the public ‚Äì has to go on is what former members have to say about its practices. So, here comes Louis into the fray. Now, as I just said, the church doesn't do interviews, therefore we don't get any 'official' conformation/denials as to the church's ways and means of doing things. We just get the usual former members.So, to fill the run-time, Louis re-enacts various 'scenes' from what the 'whistle-blower' says happened. These, although if true are powerful, are only one man's word as to what went on. I'm not saying they're false, but, if a documentary is going to be neutral, we're really only treated to one side of the argument. However, of course because scientologists won't contribute this is hardly Louis' fault ‚Äì it just makes for a one-sided argument.If you don't know much about the subject, you may find it all quite enlightening and even shocking, but, if you're like me and have seen plenty of previous documentaries on scientology, then it's all a bit 'samey.' It seems that the church don't like unwanted press/media intrusion and go to lengths to 'retaliate.' This comes in the form of following those following them and Louis often finds himself on the end of their film cameras, plus a few ‚Äì slightly weird ‚Äì people simply coming up to 'see what's going on' ‚Äì do they have an alternative agenda? I guess that's up to you to decide.Louis Theroux is his natural mild-mannered self (or rather 'persona') making the documentary easy to watch. However, the very subject matter doesn't really lend itself to investigating because we only get one side of the story and there's nothing here that most people who are interested in the subject don't already know (or suspect). Therefore, a lot of the screen-time feels like 'padding' with all these staged reconstructions of alleged events. No concrete conclusions are drawn from it all and whether it's simply a modern-day religion which is no worse than the more 'established' faiths is up to you to decide. If you don't know much about scientology, it will certainly make you think and any fans of Louis ‚Äì like me ‚Äì will definitely find plenty to enjoy. I just felt there was nothing here worthy of the extended run-time."
" Best insight into this paranoid organisation
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,8,"I find Scientology and cults in general a fascinating subject and have watched most documentaries on the subject including the most recent one by Alex Gibney, Going Clear. Both this and Going Clear are excellent exposes but in different ways. As one reviewer said Going Clear is more factual whilst this one gives you a better feeling of Scientology is all about - a good description in my opinion.I've often got the feeling that Scientology is somewhere between a cult and a religion but this film, more than any other, puts it squarely in the cult category.Right from the outset you get a feel for this. Requests for interviews by Theroux are turned down by the church an almost unheard of response for an organisation that large. Most will have P.R departments ready to go to any and all media interests.This makes it hard for Theroux of course. His usual film making style is subtle and he spends considerable time those involved, something impossible with this subject.So he decides to use actors and actresses to re-enact some of the abuse by the organisation's head, David Miscavige. This is powerful stuff which is different to simply hearing reports of the same abuse.But I found the real behaviour of the real Scientologists even more damning, particularly when coupled with commentary by ex-Scientologists. Near the end of the film the organisation sent a letter to Louis Theroux saying because he was making a documentary about them they intended to make a documentary about him. Such a response seemed just so totally infantile, like a young child's tit for tat: if you take mine I'll take yours kind of response. On top of the rest of the film this gave an insight into just how separated this group is from mainstream society - to even think that was an appropriate response.All in all one comes away with the a real sense that Scientology is run by a powerful and paranoid sociopath who has somehow managed to get away with what he is doing for years. A great effort by Theroux that worked much better than his older documentary on another cult: the Westboro Baptist Church."
" Interesting, surprising, unsettling
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,7,"""My Scientology Movie"" is an interesting documentary. It's certainly not the movie I expected it to be, and nor is it really the movie I wanted. I was thrown by the approach Theroux took, casting actors to play key Scientology figures David Miscavige and Tom Cruise, and having them act out allegedly violent incidents. On a second watch, the pieces fell into place somewhat. Casting actors to play Scientologists is, after all, what made the Church famous! It seemed a deliberate artifice, but as the documentary explains, that was deliberate on behalf of L. Ron Hubbard, who at first tried to convert the top movie stars of the day - Jimmy Stewart and Greta Garbo - knowing that this was the best possible route for exposure of his religion.The ""artifice"", therefore, only brings you closer to understanding what may have happened behind closed doors, especially when you hear ex-Scientology hatchet man Marty Rathbun instructing the actors in how to sound more like the modern-day emperor, David Miscavige.For a movie with a great deal of deliberate invention, the film also has a few bizarre, unscripted moments, such as the chance appearance of Hollywood party girl Paz de la Huerta, who supposedly thinks Theroux's camera crew are there to film her, and an explosive moment where Marty Rathbun loses his temper with Louis that all fans will want to see for themselves.The overall impression of the movie is that it's not as much of a Louis Theroux documentary as you might expect. He seems like someone lost at sea around all the conflicting information, the allegations, the stalking and newspeak. He doesn't know who to trust, and neither do we.It's an unsettling viewing experience, but a worthwhile one, as long as you don't expect any easy answers."
