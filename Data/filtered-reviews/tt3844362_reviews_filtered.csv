" ""Swinging by Numbers""
",2020-10-07 00:00:00,7,"Really good watch, could watch again, and can recommend (at least for the sexually open minded.)This movie focuses less on young rampant sex and more of the decline that people sometimes get as they get older and want to be more adventurous without destroying their relationships. It also doesn't treat it as ridiculous a thing, while still openly admitting that it is something foreign and strange.The movie does a great job of leading the audience (alongside the main character couple) into this strange new world, not of debauchery, but love and connection. Given that the premise of the movie is them getting together, it's not a spoiler, but this is a romantic comedy for couples, basically.There is plenty funny to this movie, but if you're not into sex-based comedy, then this isn't for you.If you liked ""A Good Old Fashioned Orgy"", then you should give this a watch."
" Artsy fartsy porn
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,1,"Cheap, pretty cheap attempt at comedy.
What type of people are they showing?
This is a total waste of time.
You'd better watch porn. At least you'd see better looking people having sex and you'd not have to endure the inane plot."
" Pretty funny, not-stupid modern comedy.
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,7,"I'm kind of surprised at the ratings for this movie. Aside from the degenerate actions of the characters, I thought it was pretty funny.This soon turns into a downward spiral. Similar to many typical raunchy comedies, our middle aged characters (all parents of small children) get drunk and smoke pot like a bunch of failed teenage high-school drop outs. Eventually we their actions turn more and more sexual, past the point that you, the viewer, are convinced of some sort of swinger conspiracy.The story goes on and some motivations are realized. There's not really any moral lesson to this movie, so don't expect that. I won't spoil the ending but I will say I was hoping for something different.Regardless, I thought the movie was funny and entertaining and awkward, just as it was meant to be. I don't connect with these characters in any way, and would never find myself in a position such as theirs, but from an outsiders perspective, it was an interesting ride."

" Good film funny

" NOPE DO NOT WATCH ....!!!!!!!
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,1,What a terrible film i did not laugh once i did however watch till the end just to see how it ended but wish i didn't it is 90 mins i will never get back ......!!!!!!
" Waste of time
",2019-10-12 00:00:00,3,"My 3 Stars are for the sexual tension they created, the script was decent and the fact that they let the characters dare to be different. But it was more of a tease, Things didn't make sense, and it just left me confused. Not something I would watch again & I wouldn't recommend."
" Enchanting and unsettling by turns even if it ultimately seems a bit pointless.
",2019-06-06 00:00:00,7,"I saw this ages ago but I decided to review it when I found out it was by the same guy who did the ""Creep"" movies. How about that. I like finding out things like that.This movie is quite singular. It has this unassuming, disquieting power, like the first act of thriller where everyone thinks everything is fine until everything isn't. With limited characters, setting and time lapse (it is indeed the events of a night) the effect relies on making sure the characters are vivid and three dimensional and they all just pop of the screen.It always has this sense of build up to something immense and never quite pays off so I'm tempted to say it's more like one of half or two thirds of a great movie without really being a great movie itself, though its a great two thirds.it's on one level very simple; an innocent rendez-vous of an inhibited couple and an exhibitionist couple leads us to find that neither is exactly what they seem.it's not really a profound or vivid narrative. It's more like those dinner parties you have in your life where the conversations plus the wine makes you think you've had an epiphany on how to unlock the potential of living until the next morning where you just get to work as usual.it's definitely the journey not the destination and you get an agreeable amount of frankness about human sexuality. it's not always easy viewing but it shows an admirable amount of restraint in its script.Memorable but I still feel a bit at a loss for what it was even trying to say."
" Emotional Rollercoaster
",2019-03-18 00:00:00,9,"Being a big fan of Tailor Schilling I really wanted to watch The Overnight, but four years after the movie's release I found it really hard to find a viewing platform. Unlike other Schilling appearances this was not on Netflix or Amazon. So in the end a friend gave me her copy to watch.
I thought this was a brilliant film, because it was so different from the mainstream blockbuster. With no big budget, ($200,000) and no famous actors it still gripped me from start to finish. I only recognised Schilling on the cast list but the other three actors were really good too.
I loved the intimacy of the location and short twelve hour timeline of the script which I felt made empathy with the characters more intense; the way the night gradually became stranger and darker really held me in an emotional spin to the end. Personally I made sure the first time I viewed The Overnight I had no previous siting of the trailer or reviews, and I would highly recommend this approach.
I didn't find the film offensive in any way. The pool scenes a bit daft maybe and the scenes at the end of the film although erotic due to great acting were not in the slightest pornographic and may have ended too soon.
Isn't it strange how in the Western world making films depicting graphic violence, huge body counts and attacks on women are taken as being quite normal and hardly worth a comment but introduce a little bit of sex and nudity causes many people (including reviewers of this film) to reach for the smelling salts. That is perverse.
Great film, highly recommended for the open minded amongst us.Graham UK."
" A 21st Century Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice
",2018-08-06 00:00:00,4,"It's not a reboot or a remake, but highlights many of the same sexual awareness themes and general pop psychology undercurrents of the earlier film. The more things change, the more they stay the same. The acting is more than adequate, the comedy is rather spare and then frequently predictable and the overall effect is, in my opinion, underwhelming."
" Laugh-out loud funny sex comedy, a must watch !!
",2018-01-20 00:00:00,8,"Excellent, smartly written very funny sex comedy.
Has none of the gross out teenage comedies type of humor. 
Excellent and very funny script and dialogues - there were moments that actually made me laugh out loud !!
Those looking for erotic titillation move on - the themes, dialogues and settings are very adult but not erotic or softcore
They are more played out for laughs - and very effectively so!
There is one mildly sexy FMFM 4some scene that however quickly breaks up unexpectedly in a most funny way, in keeping with the spirit and theme of the movie.
And the twist near the end of the movie - nicely done !!!
Two thumbs up, definitely a must-watch!"
" Very odd
",2018-01-07 00:00:00,7,"There are a lot of cringe-worthy moments and i'm not a prude at all. The movie makes me uncomfortable at times but I really like that it explores men's body image issue, which is often ignored. Overall, this is a kind of movie that you should watch at least once. I will not rewatch it though."
" Nothing special - no need to stay the night
",2017-12-25 00:00:00,4,"Two couples (Jason Schwartzman and Judith Godr√®che / Adam Scott and Taylor Schilling from ""Orange Is the New Black"") make a playdate which grows into something more than sipping wine and watching the children play together.Found this little indie thing in Netflix, watched it to see Scott and Schwartzman who have a habit of appearing in comedies that I like (in addition to many generic movies but whatever, I like those dudes).""The Overnight"" is not really a drama nor comedy but a tale of relationships: what makes us get together and stay together.Despite the promising topic and pretty cool promos, It does not really go anywhere. There's no suspense of any kind (surely a killing blow to any movie about relationships) and the approach is too improvisational (a lot of dialogue, mostly just talk-talk-talk without any memorable lines or highlights).But hey, I saw my dudes and it's over quickly, in 83 minutes.Exec produced by the Duplass brothers which gives you strong hint about what to expect from the general vibe.Written and directed by one Patrick Brice, whose only previous movie was horror ""Creep"". Whatever this means."
" Quirky, Dry Humor
",2017-11-03 00:00:00,7,"This was a funny movie. Admittedly, not everyone appreciates this sort of quirky, dry humor, but I found it entertaining.The best part was the ""Bada Bing"" moment at the end. After spending the night resisting their new friend's overtures, Alex and Emily eventually agree to give in and play along. So, the next time they see Kurt and Charlotte at the park, they hint that they're now ready. But much to their surprise, Kurt interrupts them to say that he's receiving treatment and attempting to make his marriage work. So in the end, this long, uncomfortable night, was simply a long, uncomfortable night for Alex and Emily; not to mention that Kurt and Charlotte didn't even seem that interested in being friends, any longer."
" Great Movie for Indie-Lovers
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,10,"I was surprised to see how low the score was for this movie. I would've thought the people who would have actually seen it would have been the kind to like it. There's a lot of story packed into this movie for being under 90 minutes. It's honest, and never tries to be too much. The drama is authentic and relatable. The humor is in the right places at the right times. Jason Schwarzman is at his usual greatness."
