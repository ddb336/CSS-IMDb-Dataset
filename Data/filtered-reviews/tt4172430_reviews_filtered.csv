" Potential. And yes, typical Michael Bay for sure.
",2021-04-01 00:00:00,6,"Nice story. Decentish acting. A bit hollywoody. Too many Michael bay firework ""spark"" like explosions like Transformers. Does he always use the same dynamite/pyro team in all his movies? Rated a little high I think. Worth a watch but not one of the better military flicks. A solid 6."
" Regular...
",2021-03-29 00:00:00,6,"Good movie, they made an unsympathetic American ambassador to not pity his death, I liked the atmosphere of tension, but in the course it got boring, despite being based on real events, I didn't even win, the sleep was bigger, regular..."
" What a great warfare film!
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,10,Very challenging story and action. The brotherhood of these team show us how great they are. Deadly attacks and massive blood-scars from this film very good.
" Best line
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,10,"""If it was four other guys I don't think they would've done it """
" Sad and amazing
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,10,"FK the government Obama and Hilary , all they needed was air support. And thanks to them Rone Doherty and 2 others lost their lives , Such a great story."
" Such a good movie
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,10,"I love John krasinski he's a legend my favourite but all the cast is so Great, BuT the story ... is filled with action and adrenaline and sadness, i comes down to the luck of survival , the Comradery of the team is incredible, the deaths are so sad , RIP Doherty who just came to help and Rip Tyrone , what a story , probably my favourite real war story , 6 men one mission what a story , so incredible."
" I love this film!
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,10,"I'm not a big ""war film"" buff but I was suprised by how much I enjoyed this one. Not just because of the story but the whole feel of the film. It's an adrenaline rush all the way through. Beast of a cast!"
" I've never been a Bay fan..and he proves me again why.
",2021-03-10 00:00:00,5,"Bay certainly has a style of his own, albeit one that again harks back to the 1980s -- an even more cartoonish variant on the music-video bombast pioneered by directors such as Tony Scott. Could have been a fascinating and timely study of men juggling their jobs with complicated families lives but instead it is just another Michael Bay movie."
" Liked it!
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,7,"Yes, its a typical michael bay movie from hollywood. But a very intense one, that keeps you at the edge of you seat from the first minute.Just lean back and have fun!"
" YAWN - FLAT AS A PANCAKE!
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,3,"Completely disengaging, that's two hours of my life I won't get back. 13 hours? It felt like it. Score failed to stir, lacklustre and formulaic in every respect."
" The Acting was EXCELLENT, these actors should have gotten ALOT MORE CREDIT!
",2021-02-19 00:00:00,10,"The first part I found a bit slow, but you can't take your eyes off the action once it all starts. An authentic take on the real time events of 11 September 2012 at Benghazi, Libya, a thumbs up to yet another Hollywood flick based on American presence in some war-ravaged part of the globe, almost all of them are good.The Acting was EXCELLENT, these actors should have gotten ALOT MORE CREDIT! The whole scenario of what happened is still controversial, but this movie is insane. I can't believe that one critic complains that the Mercedes wasn't even made yet. C'mon you're pulling at straws because of the corrupt ness of the whole situation! This movie should have won awards, but kiss ass to the government I guess!
You really should watch this movie, you'll laugh, you'll be mad, you'll cry. I cried the whole last half hour. Very POWERFUL!
I watched it to begin with because my favorite actor Pablo Schreiber is in it. What a babe!! All the guys on the team were gorgeous and ripped! Not afraid to get down and dirty though. Great workout scene with Pablo (Tanto) for the girls...the Whole movie is so gripping! I watched it twice in a row because there's SO much going on! Great Actors! Great Job! THIS WAS THE AWARD WINNER regardless of who won in ""real?"" Life!
Karin
I want to add in that Pablo Schreiber is NOT only such a beautiful man, he is probably the best actor right now. His voice is so clear, eloquent, and just wonderful to listen to, he's absolutely the best spoken actor of now. I could listen to this man speak all day and night, as I have watched every movie he's in. His acting is superb, I actually cried when Merriman died at the end of ""Den of Thieves""! The tear rolling down the side of his head, just threw me over the top. The scene where they're talking to the Prom date, he totally took over and spoke for them all, lol! What a line ! Class. Every role he takes on, he becomes that character. Bravo!"
" Rip to brave hearts
",2021-02-18 00:00:00,10,"Overall rating should be 10/10 but I'm pretty sure that peaceful community people have reduced them.
Rip to brave hearts"
" Bay at his most focused
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,10,"This is a great film. It does away with the politics and gives a straight forward team of men who are protecting each other in order to survive. I truly believe this is Bay at his most focused, yes there are moments where he puts in his Bayisms but other than that the action is great, the actors were top notch (Krasinski is a star), and the story is gripping. This is a highly recommended film."
" Amazing cinematography
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,7,"Truly amazing cinematography, not a big Michael Bay fan but this movie is beautiful in many ways. Also has a great story. Probably let down slightly by the actors. All in all, a brilliant depiction of an intense warzone with really gritty drama.I did find it to be sickeningly ""Hoo-ra"" in favour of Murica though. Just for the record, Murica went to Libya and completely ripped the place to shreds and destabilised the entire region. Multiple references throughout the movie about that being Libya's own fault. History is often told by the victors I suppose."
" A good movie based on real events
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,8,"If you are interested in military and action films, you can definitely watch this movie. This movie is based on real events and gives an insight as to how CIA uses private security agencies to guard their installations. Two private security guards were awarded CIA stars for their bravery in Benghazi. The movie captures their squad's bravery on the screen.Every company has a mix of FTE and contractors. Quite often, contractors do not get the credit or the respect they deserve. The movie is narrated from the perspective of CIA contract employees. Time and Again, the private security guards are insulted by their CIA bosses since the guards come from a humble background and that the bosses and the analysts running the CIA base went to Harvard and Yale. Watch this movie to see if the insults and taunts have any impact on their motivation levels.While the movie is good, some action scenes are not convincing. In one scene, despite heavy firing you will see Terrorists approaching the person firing at them. This gives you a feeling of playing a video game. Definitely, the movie keeps you glued to the screen through out."
" So amazing
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,10,"Discovered this today by accident and what an epic accident. I just loved everything about it. I found it really inspiring given being based on true events that gets you thinking about life and about how many great human beings existed and exist fighting for the world. It's about resilience, strength, hope, love... with the right amount of suspense, tension, violence and a couple of laughs. Just go watch it!!!"

Some military behavior is unreal. For example: they don't have a canteen with water."
" could be good BUT
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,5,"Shaky cam destroyed everthing. handeld ok, but stop shaking the cam around like a monkey, that does not make the movie more thrilling."
" A true story
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,10,"The movie was just wow. I cried, got mad, laughed, fell in love with the soldiers who fought. It was everything and more. Not to mention it's a true story based on real lives. Their story deserves to be told. They are hero's"
" Too long, too Michael Bay.
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,4,"There's a good movie in here somewhere. It's probably about 90 minutes, has a solid beginning, middle and end, and tells true enough the story of what happened in 2012. Unfortunately Michael Bay has no subtlety and the final product is padded with Hollywood clichès and occasional short bursts of absurd violence that made me laugh out loud. This is another movie ""based on a true story"" that suffers from generic film tropes and weakly developed characters."
" A Terrifying Event Given the 'Call of Duty' Treatment
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,4,"13 Hours is directed by Michael Bay, written by Chuck Hogan and stars John Krasinski among others. It tells the true story of the six soldiers apart of a security team fighting off attackers in Libya after an attack on the U.S. embassy. Despite the mixed to positive receptions, 13 Hours heavily underperformed at the box office in 2016.Going into 13 Hours my expectations were relatively low due to Michael Bay's involvement, I figured the action would be decent but everything else about the film would leave more to be desired, such as good character acting, the cinematography and story progression. With directors like Peter Berg and Katheryn Bigelow offering gritty war films, with well-realized characters, it's hard to compete in a genre like this and Michael Bay's 13 Hours pales in comparison to films like The Hurt Locker and Lone Survivor. It almost feels like a little brother to those films, it tries to replicate the same formula of incorporating characters the audience can sympathize with alongside dark, realistic violence. 13 Hours fails at this though, I didn't know anything about Jack Silva nor the rest of the squad by the end of the film. I understand war movies are not deep character studies, however, 13 Hours tries and fails at characterization, as it was difficult to get past the wooden acting and cheesy dialogue. John Krasinski did a fine job in his role and the rest of the actors were decent too however the film fails at establishing who each character is outside of the quick exposition near the beginning. I never got a good feel for each member of the secret squad, leading me to not know who was who during the climax. This confusion of characters may be the result of the way the action is directed though.Bay has a certain flair for directing action in his movies, it's usually very loud and in your face, and although those traits certainly appear in all of the action sequences, much of the violence felt like it was ripped straight from a Call of Duty game. It was extremely loud, with lots going on and lacked any sort of suspense. I didn't feel what I should have during much of the movie, the endless waves of enemies almost felt cartoonish in nature. I felt that the movie failed at a lot of what it wanted to do and am not sure what the point of telling this story was. It might have fared better in the hands of a more competent director who could portray the sequences with more passion.I wasn't a fan of the look of 13 Hours either, the look was very glossy and the shaky cam used during action scenes made it difficult to tell what was happening in certain scenes. I understand that there was a discourse between shooting on film or digitally and that the filmmakers used a combination of both. It's pretty obvious to tell when which technique was used as scenes that were shot using film looked very nice and I must praise Bay and his cinematography Dion Beebe in those instances as they captured some really nice shots. The rest of the movie's shooting style left more to be desired though.I understand the desire to bring this story to life, but the way the filmmakers went about it left way more to be desired. It's certainly not the worst movie ever, however, I can't help but have wanted more from it. Not just for moviegoers but out of respect for those who were depicted in the movie and those who can relate to instances such as the ones the soldiers were faced with. I understand this movie received pretty positive audience praise and that's fine, I'm not here to trash the troops or the actual event that happened on September 11th, 2012. All I wish was that the depiction of the event was handled a bit better than it was; for that reason, I am giving 13 Hours a 4/10"
" Brotherhood, bondage and socialeconomics
",2020-12-28 00:00:00,9,"The movie is based on a real event. Many people would assume this would be just another generic movie. But no, it is more than that. This creates a story of brotherhood, bondage and morale. There is also a slight twist on the socialeconomic status of Libya, just little."
" This is a pretty good movie, but...
",2020-12-25 00:00:00,8,"It's neither a masterpiece, nor is it even historically accurate. Some of these reviews are written as if this were a documentary. It's a dramatized version of a real-life event.But it is well shot, and the majority of performances are great. Absolutely captures your attention over the two plus hours. And it holds up well. I've rewatched this several times, on NetflixWhat I like most about this film, is that it really stays away from the political editorializing that has occurred, in hindsight.There's no doubt this was a tragedy, and obviously a massive clusterbleep, but rather than focus on political talking points, it focuses on the lead up to this event, and effectively demonstrates how quickly things went south.8.5/10"
" Not much of a story
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,5,Some crazy guys fighting against some other crazy guys. And both sides believe that they are serving the right cause.
" I had no idea that Bay directed this until I saw the credits. Fantastic film.
",2020-12-05 00:00:00,8,"I can't add much more to what has already been said by fellow reviewers. I echo the sentiments that this is a riveting and powerful film that really hits you. The writing is strong, the dialogue great and directed solid. Which I said in the title of my review: I had no idea Michael Bay directed this. And that really surprised me as I've become used to the typically hollow films he's made in the past. So it was really surprising when I saw the credits. He nailed it."
" [9.2] Meticulously made
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,9,"13 Hours, a movie based on true events, Mitchell Zuckoff's book and under the masterful direction of Michael Bay.(+) Realistic screenplay and storyline(+) Heartfelt and amazing acting by the cast (most of them true professionals)(+) Superb cinematography, photography and filming(+) Dramatic accompanying score(+) Huge amount of efforts put into the movie and its correct depiction (dramatized)(-) Sometimes, a feeling that, matters lost intensity, viciousness or weren't realistically happening.A movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat and forget about the time passed."
" Michael Bay directed this...
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,8,"And I have to say, congrats man. Seriously, put this movie on top 3 movies from Michael Bay.This is one of the bests movies I have seen, about war, about conflict, about brotherhood and duty.
I dont go much for the patriotic movies, but this one is pretty on point.Amazing editing, plot is easy to follow and digest. The script I bet didnt take too much time, but it wasnt that necessary. Really well done movie."

" This is dramatic and awesome!!!
",2020-09-25 00:00:00,9,"13 hours was awesome, and there are a lot of good I can say about this movie. The only downfall I have about this is it's accuracy, but that's it. The rest of the film is awesome because of the mature approach by Michael Bay, and by the awesome ensemble cast.I give this a 9/10"
" Great action movie
",2020-09-24 00:00:00,8,"Inspired on real events. Focusing on the core team of soldiers protecting the embassy. Great action drama, very well made."
" Incredibly intense war movie
",2020-08-12 00:00:00,10,"13 Hours is an incredibly intense war movie that's thrilling, tense and emotional whilst easily being one of Michael Bay's best films. James Badge Dale and John Krasinski both give incredible performances and Pablo Schreiber, Max Martini, David Denman and Dominic Fumusa are all great and together they have fantastic chemistry. Michael Bay's direction is excellent and more restrained in places than usual. It's extremely well filmed with visceral action sequences and it's also extremely well paced. The music by Lorne Balfe is amazing."
" Bad filming
",2020-08-12 00:00:00,2,"Interesting story but the filming constantly moving and shaking during action scenes is really annoying and gives me a headache. Stop filming action films like this we don't understand, only the director is having fun."
" How it was
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,10,This was an Afghanistan action movie in my own words I really felt the emotions and death triggers in the movie grazie mille guys we want more
" Why isn't this movie 13 hours?
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,9,"Amazing movie. I love war movies there are the best and this movie was one of the best war movies i have ever seen. If you like war movies like me this is a must see, you won't regret it."
" Exaggerating the truth
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,5,"I enjoyed this movie immensely, but as for historical accuracy, and military authenticity..... so so far from it.Why do US movie makers in their recent war movies consistently embellish the truth.??"
" The best movie I have seen
",2020-07-10 00:00:00,10,"This is without a doubt my favorite movie of all time.
I have seen it 20+ times and for me it seems very realistic and it is incredably well done.
The fact that it is based on a real story is mind blowing. Those people are real heroes!"
" A Masterpiece by Michael Bay

.

📜 Plot : Based on real life events ,post the Death and end of Dictatorship of Gadafi in Libya, there is still chaos in the country and when an attack happens on an US compound, a contracted security team of ex militants struggle to keep CIA team safe and find ways out of the chaps.
.

👨‍⚖️ Review : 13 hours is an iconic recreation of true life events by the master of action movies Michael Bay. I believe he is only one true legend who could have done this. 13 hours is visually stunning, engaging and a true masterpiece of an action film. The Movie is 140min long representation of what happened in the 13 hours of war between the CIA and Ansar al Sharia Terrorists on 11 September 2012.The characters played by John (Jack) and James (Rone) , Pablo (Tanto) stick with you after the movie has ended as their personalities are perfectly portrayed by the actors. The Comradry and relationships between the soldiers, the willing to fight for the country no matter what, promises made to families to come back safe all these make you numb and touch your hearts in its core.My favourite was the brotherhood of Jack and Rone which sets the movie apart. The Patriotism and Mood of the movie lifts up your spirits on how these soldiers never gave up , never surrendered and kept the war on for 13 long hours in an unknown territory with no backup. Hats off to those Soldiers and Hats off to Michael Bay for recreating this Historic yet tragic event in chapters of War by Men.

" Superlative action
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,8,"A good film, full of suspense. Without big names in the cast, the director managed to do a very good job."
" Wasted opportunities in a nutshell.
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,5,"I watched this movie with 2 friends: One of us was occasionally keeping us updated on whats going on, the others were bored to death.13 Hours is, once again, a movie based on a true story in a warzone where america saves the day. It starrs characters who look the same, act the same and have those cringeworthy lines of ""cool"" dialogue which should make us feel sympathetic towards them.To the writers: No it doesn't! Never in the history of any army movie this has ever worked for me. It's just cliché. Please stop. (And don't ever bring that ""If you don't do anything, americans will die"" line. There literally are allied non-americans fighting with you, and you're killing off hundreds of family fathers, that's just nasty.)
The characters are by far the worst part of this movie. Especially in the last few minutes, where we should feel something as one of them gets buried under what was once a house. But I was just horribly confused as to who died, because they all look and act the same.I have to admit, when I heard that Michael Bay directed the movie, I expected worse. Of course, there still are some really unnecessary slow motion sequences, but the explosions were almost non-existent. Proud of you Miky <3The locations are extremely gorgeous, gotta give 'em that.The actors are fine, they do the best they can with those characters. The effects are quite nice. Nothing special about them. The rockets looked nice I guess.Now comes the story: It's based on true events, which can be interesting (see Kursk). And here, it's also an interesting event, almost unbelievable. And yet, the writers messed it up with uninteresting, replaceable characters.In essence, this movie is a giant wasted opportunity to create a menacing atmosphere in an unescapable situation."
" Bay CAN direct
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,7,"How is it that Michael Bay can give us something as action packed and slick as this film and in the same breath delivery works as poor as Transformers and 6 Underground, this is the biggest travesty here.
13 Hours is a brilliant 'action' film with well directed scenes and explosive sequences. Product placement that's not so heavy handed (other than the Macdonald's placement) and makes audience feel for the characters.
A great action movie that proves the Bay can direct but asks the question why doesn't he do this all the time?More like this please Mr Bay and we might forgive you for destroying Transformers and the other horrendous examples of your directing."
" Felt like I was watching a movie from the bad guys POV
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,4,"I don't really know any of the IRL politics... but watching this movie, the americans are occupying foreign countries, living in a mansion surround by an oasis, high-fiving each other for changing the politics of the countries they're in. Meanwhile the citizens of this country live in poverty, and are bullyed around by americans there on a military mission.So I totally understand the great injustice the people of these countries feel and why they are angry at America. The humanization of the american soldiers feels out of place... instead of wimpering about their wives and children, Michael Bay should have went all-in on the bad guy angle and made them misogynistic women beaters. They could've shown their wives cheating on them while they were away on a mission to explain all their pent up anger.But instead, I end up really conflicted. It's like the americans are the only ones with wives and children, their mission is completely immoral and insensitive, but because John Krasinski has such a big smile, I'm supposed to cheer for them? I dunno. Maybe it's because I'm not racist, or maybe it's because I'm not American, but I didn't really feel compelled to cheer for the good guys at any point during this movie. The good guys mostly sucked and their motives weren't explained any better than ""we're just here on a mission, and we don't want to die"""
" Brilliant
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,10,Fantastic action! Emotional and gripping throughout
" Michael Bay is just awful
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,1,"I've never been in the military. I don't know the facts about Benghazi. My review is simply from a movie critic standpoint (I'm no critic, just a fan of film). This movie was atrocious. The dialogue was childish and pandering. The special effects were typical Michael Bay...explosions and action that still didn't feel like action. The acting was poor and unbelievable. I just don't understand why this movie is getting such high ratings, but I imagine it's from people who sympathize with the para-military operators whose lives were lost. And there's nothing wrong with that...I sympathize too. My beef has nothing to do with the story itself, but it has everything to do with the filmmaking. If you're 12 yrs old or younger, you may like this movie. Anything older and you're going to want to avoid it."
" A perfect one
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,9,"13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is a action thriller film directed and produced by Michael Bay and written by Chuck Hogan, based on Mitchell Zuckoff's 2014 book of the same name. The story in this movie and screenplay is very good which is supported by good acting of the actors.John Krasinski was phenomenal as Jack Silva, Pablo Schrieber was perfect for Tanto, James Badge Dale was great at playing Rone, Max Martini playing Oz was incredible, David Denman as Boon was just amazing, and Dominic Fumusa as Tig was great to watch. Another most important aspect of the movie is its realistic approach director Michael Bay as he showed people the hell these soldiers went through with no support, no backup and no medics. All they had was each other. Technical aspects and VFX is also good in this film. The few drawbacks in story include loud music and absence of transition in story line."
" When Bay becomes a sea- superb
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,9,"Finally a Michael Bay movie without his typical style.13 hours is an honest depiction of a heroic struggle of a number of individuals stranded in a confusing situation at Benghazi, Libya.The plot takes care to develop the characters. In fact half of the first half is meticulously used to develop the characters and the tempo. But once everything is in place, BOOOM. Once the movie started taking gear, you cannot practically even blink. The director does not make any effort to make any political commentary. He simply shows the events through the eyes of those who were there. Unfortunately, this was the lowest grossing film of Bay's career. Maybe this will become a cult movie in the coming years. Strongly recommended."
" Reasonably good, action-drenched depiction of the 2012 Benghazi attack
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,7,"Following an attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, a group of CIA operatives and private military contractors mount a bloody defence of a CIA outpost against mobs of heavily armed jihadists. I have no experience by which to judge 'combat' scenes in films but the battles in this seemed realistic, and were certainly exciting and well done. Director Bey (whom I associate with sophomoric action-adventure fluff and with crap such as 'Armageddon' (1998) and 'Pearl Harbour' (2001)), reins himself in somewhat, and other than a couple of trite 'slow motion, back-lit, group-walks toward the camera' and a gimmicky freeze-frame shot of a mortar shell descending followed by a Forrest Gump-style image of a singed baby-picture floating though the smoke, eschews his usual over-the-top pyrotechnics. The cast is fine (admittedly I found most of the main characters more-or-less interchangeable), as was the script/story, (although a bit too many tough-guy, bro-binding exchanges and family-time cutaways designed to humanise the rugged (American) bearded-killers). The jihadi bearded-killers don't get much back-story as they are methodically mowed down but I found the final scenes of their families coming to mourn to be more affecting than the corresponding scenes in the CIA compound. The film has some similarities to Ridley Scott's superior 'Black Hawk Down' (2001) but lacks the palpable tension that Scott deftly builds in his story of desperate, out-numbered, elite fighting men. The historical accuracy of the film has been debated but considering the players involved, what really happened may never be made public. All-in-all, watchable (for fans of this kind of border-line jingoism) and not bad for a Michael Bey opus (and a great ad for armoured Mercedes Benzes)."
" A Masterpiece, this needs to be remembered 👌🏾
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,10,"Loved this movie from beginning to end, such courage, sacrifice and professionalism. These men saved lots of people with no help... I nearly cried with lots of emotions when they decided to take the last stand upon seeing convoy trucks, military men and tacticals approaching and Tanto with a quaver voice asking the chief if they were expecting any friendlies? This is a must watch for every movie and history lover, we need to remember these men and what they did, not forgetting those we lost."
" Team America: World Police
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,3,"This was a fine piece of imperialist, militarist propaganda masquerading as ""truth"".The truth claim is repeated over and over again in the blu-ray extras, as well as in the opening titles of the movies itself: ""This is a true story""Just 15 seconds before this claim, the opening titles also claimed that ""The CIA watched for lethal weapons before they spread to the global black market""Two years before this movie premiered Seymour Hersh published an article, ""The Red Line and the Rat Line"", in London Review of Books which revealed that the purpose of the consular annex was the exact opposite of what the movie claims. The consulate's only mission was to provide cover for the moving of arms. The so-called ""rat line"" was used to funnel weapons and ammunition from Libya via southern Turkey and across the Syrian border to the opposition (to Assad). Many of those in Syria who ultimately received the weapons were jihadists, some of them affiliated with al-Qaida.So right off the bat I knew that the ""truth"" claim was to be taken with an enormous grain of salt.The blu-ray extras also hail Bay's aim for realism. As one actor claimed, ""His attention to detail is unbelievable, and he's committed to doing it properly"". Then we see Bay gingerly trimming the cuts on Pablo Schreiber's clothes with a small scissors. Of course, the extras also point out the military training the actors had to go through, all in the name of realism.And then Michael Bay hires an actor with the strongest Iranian accent imaginable, who obviously doesn't speak a word of Arabic, to play the Arabic interpreter Amahl. That's some attention to detail you got there, Mike. Couldn't find a single Arabic speaking actor (who, importantly,can also master the distinct Libyan Maghrebi dialect anywhere? Or perhaps realism is only interesting when it has to do with the military and guns, as per usual in Hollywood movies.And of course, since the movie is blatant propaganda, no one questions with a single word the very existence of a secret base with armed military personnel, who apparently have enough arms to fight a smaller civil war. Actually, the only one who makes sense in this whole movie is the appointed villain, the milquetoast, pudgy and balding CIA chief (in contrast to the buff military guys who Bay carefully show off shirtless and glistening with sweat) who points out that they have no jurisdiction and aren't even officially there. Of course, the other characters and the movie itself tell him to go frak himself, the stormtroopers of the empire can do as they damn well please! And of course, the blu-extras contain the usual circle jerk with people in the production tripping over each other in a competition to see who can praise the military the most.Technically, the movie is great, especially the cinematography. However, the lack of continuity where we can cut from night, to daylight, to dusk, to night again between shots is a further indication of the level of attention to detail this movie pays.Bay is a great director of action spectacle, but he has never been able to master character moments. Those parts of the movie, especially the scenes where Krasinski's character is speaking with his family, are about as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face. Krasinski turned out to be a great director with ""A Quiet Place"", but he has never been much of an actor, and this movie is not an exception.If this movie had just presented itself as an action flick, that would have been fine. But the ""truth"" claim killed it."
" B graded movie is far better than this
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,1,Totally waste of time. Watch it if you have way much time in your hand.
" Really good had potential for awesome
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,7,"-This movie got the American operators 90% correct the attitudes and sheer bravery of operators was showcased very well.
The interpreter in my opinion was not like any ""terp"" I've ever met. They are usually fearless and would've had something better to say to the enemy than ""this is the 17th of February"" I mean the event took place on September 11th so uhhh?The TOC chief had no strategy that we were aware of make something up at least.similarly we find out nothing of why the insurgents are attacking just an obscure group of rebels that have loose loyalties I think they could've played some insurgent leader against the toc chief that would've been cool.finally no talk of a certain negligent Secretary of State hmm."
" Great movie
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,9,I am a big fan of the movies based on real events. The cinematography was great. They got good locations to shoot as well. Hats off to the team who brought this movie straight up for the people showing how politics can stake some lives for their own confidential sakes .
" Absolutely loved it
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,9,"I hadn't seen this film for so long because I was put off by the length, 2.5 hours. But, I am kicking myself because it's a fantastic film.
Knowing it's a true story just really adds to what you are witnessing. You are rooting for the characters more which really adds to the emotion of the film. The talk of families and the bonding of the soldiers added to this as and it was done really well, each soldier had little personality quirks and it just really made me root for them all, but like I mentioned prior it just really adds to the emotion.Yeah, it's a must watch film.Ps: you don't need to know about the true story prior as it also works really well as a film without any knowledge of the Benghazi attack."
" Glosses over horrific missteps
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,3,Too much missing info. No mention of security concerns reported earlier to State. No reason EVER given for air support not showing up. Glossed over the horrific torture endured by the Ambassador. DISGRACEFUL!
" Solid packed full of action movie
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,8,"The contractors in ""13 Hours"" are mercenaries, a bunch of battle-hardened ex-Navy SEALs, Marines and Rangers hired to provide ""babysitters"" for the CIA operatives who go into Benghazi to gather intelligence. The movie is like a throwback to the best of 90s action, but as a Michael Bay film, it's runs a bit long (144 min.) and would have benefited from a bit of trimming. Still the battle sequences are well depicted while performances are decent, especially J. Krasinski as a contractor taking the gig because his family needs the money. Ultimately, movie have a likable cast and blistering action scenes, although a few special effects might have been over the top. Highly recommended for any action moviegoer, one of Bay's best to date.Rating: 7+/8-"
" Well worth a watch
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,8,"This movie is a raw, action packed blokes movie. Very good acting also."
" Edge of your seat heroic tragedy
",2020-03-12 00:00:00,9,"Utterly engaging edge of your seat stuff. Based on the book by the very operators being portrayed in the movie, it shows the buildup and attack leading to the tragic killing of a US ambassador and his bodyguards during a massive insurgency in Libya. It also shows the extraordinary bravery and skill of the secret soldiers who were there mainly to provide security and not to engage in a massive battle.All the way through the movie I kept asking myself ""so when's the cavalry coming?"" But the cavalry never came, due to sheer incompetence or sheer indifference by the higher-ups.Is it possible that an army of insurgents can build up without anyone in US intelligence knowing? Is it possible that the insurgent army can then attack an embassy compound and no help come at all? The movie deliberately makes no judgement and leaves it up to the viewer to decide.It's an interesting illustration of our times that when these guys returned to the US, far from being lauded as heroes they were either ignored or vilified by the media. The death of a US ambassador had to be blamed on someone and it was not going to be the politicians and generals who were in charge but the nobodies who tried and failed to save him. My hat goes off to them, however, and the politicians, media and their supporters can shove it."
" Great movie

" Absolutely incredible
",2020-03-07 00:00:00,9,I absolutely love war films and I loved this i was absolutely locked in for the entire film. I've been flickering with 9 and 10 for ages a 9.5 would be spot on. Every about the film was brilliant I have no cons about the film only pros. The fight scenes were riveting and exciting. The acting from everyone was perfect. John krasinski showing once again he can act.
" This is Michael's way of telling 🖕 you critics
",2020-02-25 00:00:00,8,"Out and out action movie
I didn't had this fun in action movies since Terminator"
" totally overrated, stopped watching
",2020-02-22 00:00:00,1,"I need to balance the reviews here.
This movie is very overrated, its like watching someone play a shooter video game.
I was expecting a movie like Argo, or a good action movie. What we get is a Transformers movie with robots replaced by people. And why so long, I got so bored I stopped watching.
If this is considered a good action movie, then the standard of a good action movies has gone down.PS Micheal Bay made good movies I like in the past, like: The Rock, Pearl Harbor, The Island, Pain & Gain. But this one is definitely not one of them."
" Badly put together
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,1,"Continuity is really BAD one minute it's light next it's dark and then it's dusk, going around from one to the next! Someone should have spotted this before it left the cutting room. Now really not interested in finishing this film. If the director doesn't care about his product why should I."
" As a movie its well made packed with heavy Action ( A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,10,"A well made, not over the top factual film. Great actors with noone trying to steal the limelight. Very real scenes."
" What's the world coming too!
",2020-02-08 00:00:00,10,I love films like this that open your eyes to these types of conflicts and my lord the fire power and gun fights a unreal and so well shot. From the first fire fight to the next you can just feel the action and tension of not knowing who is your enemy. This is bays best film by a long shot!! And any way of topic and not to be disrespectful to those that died but I'd love to those actors filming this film playing with all that fire power was probably so much fun to get stuck in with all the rifles and explosions!
" Buckle up ... what a ride
",2020-02-08 00:00:00,9,"I've been meaning to watch this for so long ... can't believe I waited .... brilliant ... heart stopping, heart wrenching, edge of your seat stuff ... simple effective, grilling at every turn!"
" Brilliantly done.
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,8,"Been on my watch list for quite some time and it certainly didn't disappoint.
Brilliantly done, casting was great.
Typical Bay action depicting tragic and heroic events in Benghazi.
Definitely recommend."
" Some people handicap movie because of Michael Bay
",2020-01-30 00:00:00,10,"Amazing movie, not over the top but enough raw emotion to make you care about people. Good story, good acting...a great rewatchable. Michael Bay at his best"
" Nice action flick
",2020-01-29 00:00:00,6,"Not the typical Michael Bay movie. Athmosphere was very tense, great Sound design, somewhat realistic and likeable characters, no dumb one liners, no patriotic stuff, overall a 6/10.
There is one thing in this movie that freaks me out. When the Ambassdaor and the other guy are in the bathroom and the Diesel starts burning.... WHY ARE THEY NOT PUTTING WET TOWELS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DOOR?? You learn this in kindergarten and in school and everywhere. And they are sorrounded by towels in the scene. I mean they go into the bathroom to search cover from the fire and NO ONE has the Idea to close the gap at the bottom of the door? Fast Forward 15 seconds.. Huge black plumes come from under the door and they almost die.
That scene cost a Star :)"
" Solid film
",2020-01-27 00:00:00,7,"Michael Bay delivers a film that works, but is very empty on the character. I liked the movie and I thought Bay attempted some restraint and even makes a coherent film. My issue with him has always been the dramatic aspect of all his films, he just can't direct actors. I believe if he was to partner, it would be a great benefit for him, he obviously won't do it with his ego. 13 Hours is a tense film and that last hour is tough to watch. I wish I had the opportunity to see it on the bigscreen, but 4k will suffice. This is a worthwhile film even if the diplomatic side of things gets slightly heavy."
" Bay Goes BLACK HAWK DOWN
",2020-01-09 00:00:00,5,"Entertaining enough for what it is and reasonably sober-minded, but Michael Bay is absolutely the wrong director for this kind of film. Even his attempt and gritty, claustrophobic realism is seeped in all of his signature high-contrast, saturated, fast-cutting slow-mo chaos that he's so excels in, replete with the iconic bottle rocket explosions. In other words, exactly the opposite sort of vibe you want in your ""BIG SERIOUS MOVIE ABOUT BIG SERIOUS THING"". In other words, it's PEARL HARBOR all over again, except even more burdened by politics but thankfully free of ineptly-drawn love triangles.The cast all perform with remarkable aplomb, but these characters aren't particularly deep or complex, and the only reliability seems to come from the actors' natural charisma rather than a particularly good script. Technically everything is equally on-point; Dion Beebe's grainy and nerve-wracking nighttime cinematography has shades of MIAMI VICE '06 and Lorne Balfe's pounding score keeps the tempo up, but it's all stuff that's been seen before and that's been handled better. Like it's direct predecessors BLACK HAWK DOWN and LONE SURVIVOR, 13 HOURS can't seem to decide whether to be a solemn, moment-by-moment documentation of a situation gone horribly wrong, or a CALL OF DUTY speedrun. It's a problem that exists in many war movies, but here Bay's direction just emphasizes the dichotomy with the subtly of a sledgehammer and takes away from what could've been something so much better."
" What really happened.
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,10,This movie is like total disclosure with what happened in Benghazi. Obama and Clinton lied to America cover up their own crimes. Good Americans died because of bad Americans in Washington.
" This is a home run
",2019-12-28 00:00:00,9,What a brilliant movie. It does its job without any nonsense. It's like a near perfect gift.
" Intense
",2019-12-23 00:00:00,8,Way different than other us war movies. Heroic true events. Maybe a little exaggarated but still the fact is that they were all by themselves... so sad.
" Terrible
",2019-12-18 00:00:00,3,Incoherent and practically unwatchable. The story deserves better than this.
" Michael Bay-brand war p0rn
",2019-12-14 00:00:00,2,"Michael Bay cranks out more war pOrn so teenage boys have something to do on a Saturday night when they can't actually get a date.There's some flying bullets. Then some heartfelt talking. More bullets. Some shots of random anonymous bad guys. More bullets. More talking. etc.There are no real humans here, just some decent TV actors dressing up and playing war in Libya. A country that was destabilized thanks to America's gung-ho spirit. Throw in some good old-fashioned demonizing of America's enemy-du-jour, which in the 21st century is any country with Muslims, and you've got yourself a war picture that's at least as cliched and overwrought as any Western cranked out in the 50s."
" Worst Michael Bay movie ever even worse than the Island
",2019-11-29 00:00:00,1,"Worst Michael Bay movie ever, based on a true story but has nothing to do with the true story, terrible cast... a shoot'em up fest for the dimwits and ignorants as the mercenary thugs savages of blackwater tell the US officials what to do and shouting orders at them and even dictating policy and then going Rambo on the locals...what a nauseating movie and story"
" Impressive
",2019-11-25 00:00:00,10,Excellent from beginning to the end. Historically accurate. I'll honor the words from the guys on the ground than a politician any day. Great movie
" As a former PMC
",2019-11-18 00:00:00,8,"This movie hit home. Every PMC who signs every contract knows they have no US military support. A PMC or grouping of PMC's is on their own. Only a President can order US military action on a foreign nation without the Senate and House Approval. Had President Obama sent in a military for for support or even ordered air support for those PMC's would have made a single handed de-facto declaration of war against Libya, which at the time out armed forces were engaged in military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Adding a third conflict with another Arab state would have over extended US armed forces resources to one region, complicating a difficult situation already happening. I am glad most of those PMC's made it home alive to their families and did exactly what their contract states, solved the situation by themselves. Great movie ,but brought up horrible memories for me. With the facts I presented keep those facts in mind when sitting down to watch this movie or watch it again. ( Once was enough for me. ) Great directing and acting, pretty close to factual. Watch it or rewatch it with the facts I presented in mind and the movie will make a whole lot more sense to the viewer."
" Too Much ""American""
",2019-09-30 00:00:00,2,"This movie is just way too much ""American"", even for an American to handle. To the point thay at one point they even used the term ""Captain America"" in it. The only thing good enough to see in this movie are abs, and that too isn't for me."
" Umm.. what?
",2019-09-26 00:00:00,3,"If I hadn't known what the story was about, I would have no idea what the plot was. No idea.
Ok, the acting was great and the cinematography was good.
But.. The directing was abysmal... difficult to understand the mumbling dialogue, hard to decipher who was who and who was where. Stir in overkill battle scenes. 2 of the 3 of us watching fell asleep. Such a great story ruined by such a bad storyteller."
" Top-Notch Action
",2019-09-13 00:00:00,7,"I really don't know how accurate the story is retold by the movie but as an action/war movie 13 Hours works really well. Captivating and entertaining and a top-notch production - Mr. Bay should do more movies of that quality and bore us less with all those terrible movies of the Transformer franchise. 13 Hours is recommended if you like movies like Black Hawk Down, American Sniper, Lone Survivor and the like"
" Micheal bays best movie
",2019-09-04 00:00:00,10,"Michael bay usually catches a lot of flak, but this movie was very well done. I would recommend it to anyone."
" A must own movie for action fans
",2019-07-23 00:00:00,10,"13 Hours.Say what you will about Michael Bay and those terrible 'Transformers' sequels but this Director sure knows how to direct excellent action scenes.
'13 Hours' is in my opinion his best movie offering.
Bay's earlier films such as 'Bad boys' and 'The Rock' offered flashes of brilliance but '13 Hours' is of a much high calibre.
Based on a true story set in Benghazi 2012.
A group of ex-military contractors are providing security for an unofficial CIA base when The US Ambassador staying in the vicinity comes under attack by armed locals.
The six Contractors go to the Ambassadors aid only to end up fighting for their lives.
This is a thrilling action packed movie that is perfect for Director Michael Bay's style.
Once the action starts it is relentless with scene after scene of technical brilliance.
As aforementioned Bay is at best when directing action. The script Is tightly penned and offers none of Bay's usual grass and juvenile humour.
This film is focused and all the more brilliant for it.For Home Cinema fans this is a must own movie on 4K Blu-ray.
The image quality is of reference quality.
This is 4K eye candy with a grainless digital image that is one of the crispiest movies to grace my Blu-ray player.
HDR is sublime with rich deep blacks and eye popping colours. Detail is fine with hair and grime visible on war torn faces.
Michael Bay often uses very warm filters on his camera and this film shows the Libyan heat to dramatic effect.
Sunlight is blinding and explosions will sear the retina.
This movie is definitely in my top 5 for image quality on 4K Blu-ray.Sound is equally impressive if not even better. The Dolby Atmos sound mix is violent and offers a good workout for any dedicated Home Cinema system.
This film will sort out the wheat from the chaff in terms of a good audio system.
Bass is brutal. Gun shots have real punch and explosions will crack the plaster in your living room.
Height and surround effects are constant and precise offering true immersion.
Front sound stage is wide and aggressive with plenty of nuances to tantalise the ear.
This again easily a 4K disc in my top 5 regarding sound quality.If you're a fan of the war movie genre and appreciate well filmed action scenes then this movie is definitely for you.
If also you love great image and audio quality then this is a movie well worth shelling out your hard earned cash for."
" my notes
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,4,"It was interesting and cool to see this story told in a movie, most of which I did not know the details of. But it was really long with a lot of boring parts and horrible pacing . This movie seriously should've been at least 45 minutes shorter. The action really wasn't even that good, and there was some of Michael bay's usual cheesy dialogue and moments. (1 viewing)
SPOILERS
one good thing I will point out is that this movie did show how sad it was, even for the attackers that died, and their families. and it also showed that not all Libyan people supported this kind of violence"
" It's Bay, for better and for worse
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,7,"Michael Bay is the directing equivalent of a mobile, big-armed quarterback w/a gunslinger's mentality. He passes the eye test, and on any given play he can do things that dazzle the senses. But also on any given play he can do things that leave you scratching your head. And so it is W/13 Hours, a more serious subject than Bay normally tackles.Based on a true story, Bay does an excellent job of dropping you into the harrowing ordeal w/the characters. At times you feel as if you're pinned down there w/them. But Bay can't overcome his bad habits and worst instincts.For one, it's a tad bloated at nearly 2 1/2 hours. Bay, for all of his commercial, mainstream success, has always delivered films that are far longer than they need to be. Here the length can be forgiven a bit, as the subject warrants more depth than, say, transforming cars, but it would've benefitted from a little narrative tightening. The film also features Bay's penchant for broad, buddy cop-style humor. Soldiers certainly use humor as a coping mechanism in the heat of battle, but too often here the jokes and one-liners feel at odds w/the tone of the rest of the material.I don't know what Bay's politics are, but he doesn't use this as a political vehicle as so many of his contemporaries do, to the detriment of their storytelling. Make no mistake, there is a story w/political implications to be told here, but not from the boots on the ground side of the story. This is the story of Brave men who stepped up and proved their mettle against incredible odds and that is wisely the focus of this good but never great movie."
" Real story ! realistic
",2019-06-24 00:00:00,7,"The explosions and gun fire seems realistic. As its a real story, you cant make more comments about the movie. If you are expecting big twists in climax or something, dont watch this. Its real country love and patriotic. The movie really reflects that ! Rest in peace fellow soldiers who were killed in Benghazi that night!!!"
" Best of the kind.
",2019-05-21 00:00:00,10,I just started watching this as a real life incident based movie. But later on realised it was the best if it's kind. The Direction and Acting of the film was just overwhelming. If I kel my view about USA and Politics aside then this will be the best movie I've ever watched.
" Sound sucks
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,7,I like this kind of movies and totally respect the soldiers and what happened. It is just sad that score is so so bad.
" History that needs to be remembered.
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,10,"I put off watching this movie because obviously I knew how it ended. Regardless I'm glad I watched it & I'll definitely read the book. The death of 4 Americans was a tragedy that should have been averted had the administration in charge cared about their lives. ""What does it matter now""
It matters a lot to the families that lost loved ones on that day who were sacrificed for political gain.
This unfortunately is reminiscent of what happened in Black hawk down and we know who was responsible for the denied request of armored support made by commanders on the ground."
" Don't Pay Attention to the One-Star ""Reviews""...
",2019-02-16 00:00:00,7,"I first saw this film when it opened back in January, 2012. While it's not a ""great"" film by any stretch, it is a solidly good one. It is also Michael Bay's most *RESTRAINED* film (which isn't saying much, but it's a FAR cry better than the last four Transformers films).But, getting to the title of my comment, when I went back and watched this film for the second time (today, February 16, 2019), I felt compelled to pull up IMDb on my phone during the viewing and I checked out some of the user reviews. I found one thing shockingly in common among all of the one-star ""reviews"":Not a single one of them had any knowledge of the events of the true incident! And it was painfully obvious that they could not have been bothered to do a little research before making their inane comments public. Many did not know the name of the militant group that attacked the compound (Ansar al-Sharia), and just randomly decided that it must be ISIS. Some felt that it was a condemnation on Hillary Clinton and her actions/lack of actions as the events unfolded (there was not a single mention of Secretary Clinton throughout the entire film, good or bad). One did not even understand why the name of the film is ""13 Hours"" (seriously, did they even bother to actually WATCH the film before adding their ""thoughts"" in a blatant effort to only try to bring down the rating percentage?)!Is the film accurate? Of course not. When a movie is based on a true event, dramatic license is and ALWAYS has been used to make the film more compelling to viewers. And say what you will about Michael Bay's films, but the guy can masterfully direct action set pieces; each one expertly realized to get the viewer's heart pumping. Here, he does it again and again. Or, more accurately, two straight hours after the first bullets start flying to the bitter end.It's not a definitive history lesson on what actually happened, but it is decidedly riveting and Bay's most mature film to date. One can only hope that now he's left the directorial duties of the abyssmally and increasingly brainless ""Transformers"" franchise to other people, maybe we can start getting more films like this from him so people can remember what he is actually capable of when he gets material to work with that he takes seriously and treats it as such."
" Gripping
",2019-01-29 00:00:00,10,"Michael Bay can direct a bloody great film when he wants to. ""13 Hours"" is that film and it's unlike anything I've had a chance to see from him before. Leaning on the structure of ""Attack on Precinct 13"" (1976) and restricting himself from his trade-mark bombastical style, he's built a gripping account of the attack on the US embassy and the CIA outpost in Benghazi on September 11th, 2012. Why the things went down the way they did is a bit of a mistery to this day and it was even more so at the time. The reasons were lost on the CIA military detachment - all they knew for sure was that they couldn't trust anyone in the country that hosted them and were pretty much on their own to the very end. The idea to tell the story as a horror was therefore on the money. The assailants were shown coming in wave after wave, in a reckless disregard for their own lives. By all accounts that's how it actually happened. They were not portrayed as a faceless horde, though. We're not given their motivation but we are shown their human side, and reminded how loss of life is terrible, no matter what side you're on. This doesn't go to say that the film doesn't take a stand. It does. But it's not one of rampant patriotism, like one could've seen in Bay's own ""Pearl Harbor"" or Ridley Scott's ""Black Hawk Down"". It didn't try to portray the defeat as a victory. It didn't show the USA as a righteous peacekeeper. It's shown the American survivors counting their blessings for coming out alive and questioning what they've actually accomplished and what difference did they make at all. The role of the unseen decision makers at the top of the command structure was implicitly criticised as well. The question mark is even visualised with the very last shot in the film showing the Star Spangled Banner partially charred, riddled with bullet holes and submerged into the pool at the embassy. So it is a political film after all, but a quietly reserved one, concentrated on the realism and clarity of action, as well as on the human experience in the midst of all of it. It's one of a kind for Michael Bay, but also one of a kind for this decade in the passing. Almost ironic that people had to die for Hollywood to come up with something memorable."

" Not your typical Michael Bay movie
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,8,"13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi isn't your typical Michael Bay movie. Yes, it has explosions and cheesy dialogue, but it's much more grounded than his usual fare. This is an intense film and the performances (including a very non-Jim-Halpert John Krasinski) make it feel more realistic. It's hard to watch, considering the true story it's based on, but 13 Hours is a movie worth seeing."
" It's no secret, I'm not a fan of a lot of director Michael Bay's latest works. However, '13 Hours' was not that bad. It was decent enough to watch.
",2018-12-13 00:00:00,7,"Inspired by true events & based off author Mitchell Zuckoff's 2014 book of the same name, this biographical war film follows the story of six members of Global Response Staff (GRS), who fought to defend the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, during Ansar al-Sharia militant's attacks on September 11, 2012. Without spoiling the movie directed & produced by Michael Bay, too much; the motion picture was hatred by most of the Libyan people due to their negative portrayal. To the film's credit, I have to disagree with them, the audience does see many Muslims grieving and mourning the deaths, cause by the attacks and held signs apologizing for the extremists' violent acts. Adding on that, we do see several locals assisting the Americans. If anything, people should be angrier at the flick for being very clunky with overbearing visual special effects, chaotic camerawork & gratuitous explosions, macho sex appeal, and out of place, product placement such as 'Call of Duty' video games and cars from Mercedes-Benz. However, the worst had to be the utter lack of substance & character development within the main subjects. I can hardly remember, any of the GRS members, besides semi fictional Jack Da Silva (John Krasinski), whom comedic actor really did go all out for this role, by bulking up. Krasinski was very surprising, convincing as a serious gritty soldier. It's very unique. Don't get me wrong, the other performers did alright in the acting department as well, it's just that the personalities & charisma of their characters seem to all blended into one, during the quieter moments of the movie. None of them, stood out. They lack diversities. It didn't help that the film focus too much on overfilled action scenes, involving fictional previous missions that GRS went through, while in Libya, rather than establishing more of their family units & the warnings signs, leading to the compound attack. Their actions throughout the film didn't seem heartfelt, despite Lorne Balfe's amazing nail bitingly dramatic score. '13 Hours' really did missed some good moments to show us, how truly deep their sacrifice were. It only had surface level depiction of heroism; which is sad. Still, I like how the Rated R war film does not shy away from the gory, bloody images of war and the harsh language. I also dig the mixer of real life news archive footage of the event, with the reenactments. It gave the film a lot of authentic, unlike his other war film, 2001's ""Pearl Harbor', which borderline romantic fantasy. Surprisingly, this combat movie is little more historical accurate after the first half. However, there were some jarring things that screenwriter, Chuck Hogan & Michael Bay put in the film that really did not belong. Some examples are the way, the film constantly berating the CIA & Diplomatic Security (DS) agents outside from these private military contractors, as stuck up villainy cowardly pricks with no concept of tactical awareness. This is far from real life, as testimony shows, that both government agencies acted heroic, given the situation. While, it is true, that both groups ignore warnings like when two former security guards for the consulate, threw an IED over the consulate fence in April 2012; & just four days later, a similar bomb was thrown at a four-vehicle convoy carrying the United Nations Special Envoy to Libya, exploding twelve feet from the UN envoy's vehicle. There is little evidence that those assembles, including the Obama administration top heads deliberate sabotage themselves furthermore, by not providing air cover and ground support, that night; in order to cover up, the intelligence that the CIA was covertly shipping arms from Libya to Syria. Things like the over the top, stick in the mud, disrespectful, ineffective twit Chief-of-Station Commander, 'Bob' (David Costabile) trying to tell the men to stand down is clearly false. In real life, they were only little tactical disagreements between them about the speed with which the GRS team should depart for the rescue, not full grown hatred for each other. As for no air support argument; that is also not true, as government agencies did sent a surveillance drone to do a number of flybys, throughout the night & early morning. The reason for this, was due to the fact that there were no nearby attack aircraft on high alert that night with weapons & fuel within a 10 hour flight to Libya, because of a major maintenance overhaul. While, it's true that the closest fighter planes to trouble spots in North Africa were based in Aviano, Italy. Unlike the film, those fighter planes there, were not ready. Misleading viewpoints like these, were the reasons why some of the things told by the perspective of the soldiers were debunked in the ten investigations by different agencies on the matter. That's the problem with '13 Hours'. It's specifically composed, only by the unchecked bravado perspective of the soldiers, rather than everybody involved in the rescue mission. It's a bit one sided. Bay should had research more about the event from multiply sources including the FBI; the one by an independent board commissioned by the State Department; two by Democrat-controlled Senate Committees; and six by Republican-controlled House Committee, rather than taking the one book source material at its word. In the end, moviegoers should know, while, Bay says the film purposefully steers clear of politics. It's really not. You can clearly, see, where they stand on the issue, based off, how they market the film. Not only was this film about a controversial foreign incident released during an extremely contentious election year, with movie studios specifically marketed it to conservatives; but it also screen by key Republican Party figureheads, hoping to generate endorsement quotations. In the end, this film might have help cost, Hillary Clinton, the election, even with it being a box office bomb. Despite that & some flaws. '13 Hours' is still watchable, during its 2 hour & 24 minute runtime. It's worth checking out."
" 13 Hours. The film that gets it right.
",2018-12-02 00:00:00,10,"I'll admit was a bit worried about seeing this film. Michael Bay has made some stinkers in recent years with the Transformers films, but this is a great return to good form and a big surprise. I was blown away by this film, just as I had been like when I saw Mel Gibson's Hacksaw Ridge.Being ex military, I understand the walk of life these brave men did everyday in their lives. Having read the book, been a former soldier, a U.S. Military History enthusiast, studied the history of terrorism, and also been personally attached to those in the DOD, I knew more information about this incident than most average Americans.Bay conveys the incident without political bias, but the film indirectly points the finger at the fault of silence, poor choice/policy making, cover ups, and serious mistakes made by the Obama administration, left wing media, and other figures in DC. It doesn't drag us through the muddy mess of politics, as have other similar films. (Libya did become failed state and an ISIS stronghold, as did many places under Obama's administration)The film portrays the incident as it happened, and how it was told in the book, and by the men who fought it. The films authenticity was inspected, approved and advised on very well by some of the personnel who fought that long night. Each character is easily remembered and can be told apart. They are likable, and portrayed as people who do amazing things, but also have everyday lives like people who do not serve. All the men and their lives in the are portrayed with incredible emotional weight and care you become attached to them.The big surprise was seeing the likes of John Krasinski. I never expected to see him in a film like this. Truly a break away role for him. All the performances were non typical of a Michael Bay film. Not goofy, and just downright perfect. The action, the tension, the suspense are all excellent. Once the train gets going, Bay creates a wild and adrenaline rushed experience that is unforgettable. The action is not crazy stylized for thrills, but streamlined to convey the tension, horrors, and nightmare of the night in Benghazi on Sept 11th, 2012. It is pure combat footage of modern urban warfare.The music is non typical of Bays movies. The score by Lorne Balfe is perfect for this film. It has its thrill moments, but ranks up there with the best emotionally jarring war film scores created by the likes of John Williams, James Horner, and other elite music writers. It draws you in along with the action, and the emotional performances.This is a film that ranks up with war film experiences like Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, The Hurt Locker, Act of Valor, Patriots Day, Lone Survivor, American Sniper, and Zero Dark Thirty. Very pro American, and pro American soldier. Not right wing or nationalist.I was glad to hear that it won an Academy award of sound, but it deserved more recognition than that.This is where I come to the only disappointing thing for this film. The left wing media, the democrat party, the progressive controlled academy awards, and left wing film reviewers had already made there choice of slapping bad reviews and hating the film before it was ever released. The pro Hillary fever was deeply rooted in nearly all of Hollywood, and was a subject they love leaving out of the light. (The films release timing just also happened to be 2016, the year she lost.) The films gross was not very high but did reasonably well in such a hostile left leaning cinematic market.I have now seen this film do very well on blue ray and also it has a good following. People in America now know they were lied to about what happened that night. And hopefully the mistakes will have been learned from. I talk to other people about this film and the regret not having seen it when it was released. It grabs at my heart, and theirs was well. Hopefully it will be informative to the ignorant, and entitled attitude Millennial generation that freedom is not without cost. And Americans die, it matters."
" BAY COMES OF AGE!
",2018-11-04 00:00:00,8,"Despite all my reservations about a Michael Bay movie i watched this and was amazed! The Bay visual feast is as always present but this time linked with a highly tuned emotional resonance that i have rarely experienced in film.I found myself crying, laughing and in the same state of shock as the characters on screen.Everyone with a love of true war movies needs to see this."
" one of my favorite all time movies of this genre
",2018-10-12 00:00:00,10,"This movie is incredibly rich with great dialogue, action , tremendous writing. I am a serious movie buff and I've watched this movie multiple times, always being able to see new things and subtle detail previously missed. All of the people portraying military operatives are convincing and sympathetic. I am drawn to it to see it over and over again, I'm not clear why but this movie draws me in and is utterly compelling, wow,"
" Superb...!
",2018-09-23 00:00:00,10,"I'm not a fan of US movies post-2000. I'm a 20C person (60+). There are 2 movies that stick in my mind as every bit as great as any war movie I've ever seen from the 20C. One is Blackhawk Down. This is the other. 
The first thing that strikes me is the ordinariness of the characters portrayed. Interesting ordinary, not dull as ditch-water. Colourful personalities, but not your shouting, yelling, whooppee, hurrah, US Marine yelping, swearing and 'shouting for America' types. Their like normal guys trained to fight. I'd feel comfortable having a drink with them. They're respectful, but also highly trained, experienced, not a little world weary and cynical, and looking forward to get back to Home and Family, and staying there. But they have a job to do. A thankless, unappreciated job. 
The director IMHO, didn't make a single wrong move here. Undoubtedly there will be those who spend the entire movie 'looking for gaffs'. I feel sorry for them... For me it was as realistic a depiction of an intense and intensely confusing battle ground as I've ever seen on screen. The fog of war is right here on camera. It is very well done. 
The most frightening aspect is the 'who are the good guys and who the bad' that can never be answered from moment to moment... That is terrifying, even on screen. Can't imagine it on scene, in reality. That those guys came through all that alive, if bloodied, is a tribute not just to their training but to their strength of character. I'm not a fan of the US, but these guys would be heroes anywhere... 
its a fitting tribute to the real soldiers who fought that battle for 13 hours."
" The emotional manipulation leaves a bad taste
",2018-09-23 00:00:00,5,"I like to think Michael Bay has a good film in him that would get him critical acclaim. Pain & Gain was a step in the right direction. 13 Hours is not that film. At times I was left open mouthed with the appalling dialogue coming out of the various actors mouths.Jack Silva (John Krasinski) and best friend Tyrone Woods (James Badge Dale) are highly paid private security contractors for a secret CIA compound in Benghazi, Libya. Both are experienced men who have worked in war zones.Benghazi is regarded as the wild west where you cannot tell the difference between a friendly faction and an enemy faction. The station chief does not want the contractors to engage in any shootout in case it leads to further problems and negative media coverage.When Ambassador Chris Stevens arrives at the Embassy compound, the contractors are concerned with the light security. Their concerns are dismissed. When the embassy comes under attack, Silva, Woods and the others belated go and try and rescue the ambassador. They later try to hold off the militia. Any outside help seems to be slow in arriving.Bay has no problems with the action sequences. He also has no problems trying to manipulate the audience emotionally. Bay keeps it simple, the bad guys are the weasel pen pushers working for the State Department or the Defence Department. The contractors are virtuous, heroic. Hold on, aren't they basically highly paid mercenaries? Who knows, they are thinly characterised in this film and I could barely tell them apart.Strangely, Bay never specifically blames Obama or Hillary Clinton for the fiasco; yet his film shows that Benghazi was an absolute mess. Why does he pull his punches and not blame the people at the top? Probably in order to make the film, Bay had to manipulate the truth!"
" so-so
",2018-09-12 00:00:00,5,"Okay, what I liked about this movie, was that it was so chaotic, you basically have no idea what is going on, which is probably what it felt like over there. And Krasinski obviously. He's the sole reason I decided to watch this.What is annoying about this film is all the talk about american lives, american lives this, american lives that, is it that if lives are not american, they just aren't worth as much? I mean, americans killed two Serbian hostages, during bombing campaign in Libya, if you google that event, you only get pictures of this american ambassador, so clearly his life means more than two Serbian lives taken by americans. It's just sickening how self obsessed americans are.As for any youth that is considering joining american military and going to some foreign country to kill it's citizens, if you think events from this film were a fluke, and that america actually cares for you, don't kid yourself. They will let you die there, or if you survive they won't provide any medical help to you, just so that they could make a film about your heroic death and your american life. just don't go, stay home, live of welfare, it's way better option. Trust me, I'm not american life."
" A true story about true American heros
",2018-09-12 00:00:00,10,"Great action, very gripping and even a little emotional at times"
" Beautiful film for realists
",2018-09-08 00:00:00,10,"If you love military films that show realism, this is perfect for you. So much went into it, shed tears from me at the end. Give it a watch, you won't regret it"
" Overlong with repetitive dialogue, but ultimately a good watch.
",2018-08-29 00:00:00,6,"Michael Bay is back with more mind-numbing editing! Why does he do that? But ok, apart from that, the film has some awesome aerial photography and great cinematography. The actors are also very good - and so many bearded hunks in one film is enticing to say the least!After a very confusing start, the film gets direction, and once the first attack starts, the action never slows down. Despite all this fantastic fast-paced action, though, the film itself does seem to drag, and I just didn't find it compelling enough. Maybe because the film was overlong. They should have cut it with about 20-30 minutes. At times it felt more like a video game, distancing me from the reality of the action. And why do they insist on constantly showing the time? What did it matter? Its not as if there were a deadline, and what did it matter whether it was 12:19 or 12:20? The repetitive dialogue was also an issue for me. The film also had way too many comedy elements that didn't belong.The film has some incredible visuals, especially towards the end. I did enjoy the fact the music was so subtle, never becoming overbearing or loud."
" Style Over Substance
",2018-08-23 00:00:00,4,"One of the most violent movies I've seen in a while. And while the shots of mortar shells blowing people to bits and corpses inhabiting slaughterhouses can be arresting there's very little story underlying these shots. Props to John Krazinski for attempting to act his way through the chaos, but this movie needed fewer acronyms and more plot."
" Intens
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,8,"I find my self enjoy this movie, this intens story about the situation in Libya after Qadafi rezim, the action, the humor, all character in this movie is very well played by all the actors."
" One line
",2018-08-17 00:00:00,7,Patriotic B.S. yet I can't deny that it's very enjoyable to watch.
" Better than they say
",2018-08-13 00:00:00,8,"Of course you will see some obvious Michael Bay things in this movie ,but not as much as other of his movies. Great movie very accurate to the original story."
" WTF?!?!?!?
",2018-07-20 00:00:00,9,"Why in the hell can Michael Bay not bring this kind of intensity and emotion to every film that he directs??? Seriously, the best work that Bay has ever done, bringing everything that nobody knew he had to the table and laying it all out there. He needs to forget about the 50 'Transformers' sequels and start focusing more on films like this."
" It's an honor to know their story.
",2018-07-10 00:00:00,10,If you watch the behind the scenes you truly see the dedication and effort put into making this movie as genuine a possible to tell the story of these American heroes. My father is diplomat and it breaks my heart to see what happened to Ambassador Christopher Stevens. I purchased this movie roughly two years ago and finally worked up the courage to watch it. We owe it to those men to know their story.
" Military good, bureaucrats bad.
",2018-07-06 00:00:00,5,"Michael Bay only knows how to make a movie. The film focuses on the characters, but they do not feel like real people nor do they have dialogues that are not slogans. They reduce the Libyan situation to good and savior Americans, poor and savage Arabs."
" Tougher Than American Sniper
",2018-06-19 00:00:00,1,"This is a superb war film which follows the course of events exactly, recording the exact fatalities and injuries. The original weapons were used.This is a great action film with a likable cast of authentic America heroes. I don't like films where there are American casualties but that is a minor criticism.I don't like films which show foreigners in a good light so this film suits me. All enemy combatants are shown as cowardly primitives who were just looking to loot pockets.They could have let the audience know in which country the film was set. Why did the US have an embassy in such a basket case of a nation anyway.I liked the fact the mercenaries were all decent family men unless their Arab opponents.In the end all the bad guys were killed easily and America won the day."
" Best films deserve high division
",2018-06-18 00:00:00,10,"""Things change fast here in Benghazi."" Jack Silva (Krasinski) has just been reassigned as a guard for the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. What starts off as a routine assignment changes on September 11, 2012. When a group of insurgents breach the Embassy and attempt to kill the US Ambassador, Jack and his group of 6 have to make a decision. Follow orders and stay away, or disobey their commander and go help their fellow soldiers. I was looking forward to watching this, but I was also a little worried at the same time. The story is interesting and somewhat controversial and is a perfect idea for a movie, but it was directed by Michael Bay. For that reason I was expecting a lot of special effects and explosions and didn't think he was the director that should be in charge of this story. I'm not ashamed to admit that I was wrong. This is a realistic war movie that doesn't embellish the drama or actions, mainly because the story didn't need it. The movie is not political at all and mainly focus on the soldiers decisions. I liked it more than I expected to. Overall, not just a surprisingly good Michael Bay movie, a good movie period. I give this a high B+."
" If you like war movies, this is definitely for you. In the top 10 I've seen
",2018-05-28 00:00:00,9,"An intense movie that will keep you on your toes. Great acting, great script, immersive camera work and music, believable characters.This movie has it all for its genre. Not for the faint of heart, but a truly, truly fantastic film."
" Amazing
",2018-05-19 00:00:00,10,13 hours is an amazing portrayal of what happened in Benghazi. It gets out what happened and honors the many lives lost.
" Military Vet Approved
",2018-05-07 00:00:00,9,"A compelling/riveting dramatization of the 2012 attack on the American diplomatic mission in Libya that resulted in the death of four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, the movie is a driven entity of force vs politics - 45 minutes of setup and an eternity of relentless combat. Michael Bay, who is known for his awe inspiring theatrics provides a little zigzagging action-movie-style relief.The film brings amongst others the emotion of anger, fueled by duplicitous curvature of politics by the CIA. If your military or former it drives a nail into honoring American lives and sacrifice before political agendas. The film is well performed by all, great combat sequences and tactical overtones. This will keep your attention ALL the way through and leave you feeling proud, honored and a strong pit of emotion for those that were there."
" Almost perfect from all the reports I've read.
",2018-04-17 00:00:00,9,"I was riveted, spellbound by this, watching what I have read come to life on the screen.
""Powerful people"" tried to stop the distribution of this film and I can see why. There is even one or more bad reviews because it shows a truth that the Progressive Liberal Stalinist Democrats want to hide, that a whole bunch of Americans were in a war zone, not some peaceful place as we were told, and that they were improperly supplied, poorly secured, and there was no backup for them. Also, that there was either the biggest screwup in intelligence since Pearl Harbor, or the Secretary of State ignored it to save a couple bucks. Security should never be left to an organization like the February 17th Martyrs Brigade, who not only knew of the attack and ran away, but some were identified through surveillance photographs as part of the assault force.The film also exposes the idea that the attack on 9/11/2012 was a spontaneous event resulting from a demonstration about some anti-Islamic film. It was obviously a well planned and coordinated attack carried out in waves. That is obvious by the accuracy of mortars used and availability of heavy machine guns. In closing, never forget J. Christopher Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, and Tyrone S. Woods. In addition, do not forget the wounded and the rest who lived through that hell. And never forget that neither Hillary Clinton nor Barack Obama have ever publicly apologized or accepted responsibility for putting them in that situation and failing to act to defend them. And never forget that Ambassador Stevens' itinerary in a hostile area was transmitted in an email on an unsecure server by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton."
" Michael Bay's best film!
",2018-04-12 00:00:00,8,"If you have seen a few other films by Bay it becomes evident after a while he showed trremedeous restraint probably of respect to the subject and these courageous men. Actually the more Michael Bay films you have seen the more you appreciate this one. I wish he could have cut down a little on the artificial light-effects and some cheesy dialogue but compared to his other films it's a minor thing.
Great acting all over the board, great cinematography and style, he uses shaky cam only when it's appropriate.
Regardless of what some people say on Fox News etc. this is not an anti-Hillary movie this is about courageous americans and their initiative, their act of patriotism and sacrifice for their fellow countrymen in peril. This is a worthy and honorable salute to them."

An authentic take on the real time events of 11 September 2012 at Benghazi, Libya, a thumbs up to yet another Hollywood flick based on American presence in some war-ravaged part of the globe, almost all of them are good. 7/10"
" Rocked & loaded
",2018-02-10 00:00:00,4,"Politically loaded; it's a mess, jingoism typical of Michael Bay and then some. It also isn't technically accurate at all, but then again, it's not a documentary. You'd be a fool to learn about politics and history from a movie. Its sheer existence carries some unfortunate implications. The movie gets a lousy 2/10 if you are concerned with truth (or at least a lack of lies) and at least some objectivity.If you forget all that--like I really tried to--then the movie rocked. As in it's spectacular. Not as in it's great, because it's not. It loses gravitas due to extremely cliche characters, and some scenes were so poorly executed it all became unintentionally funny in a bad way (and I promise I'm not talking about Oz's hand). I hoped for at least one enemy to grow into a legitimate villain, but they're all just cannon fodder. I suppose Bay wanted to humanise only Americans, and it worked... but you don't have to care about politics to tell that's horrible storytelling. That's a 6/10 for me: I don't regret watching it, but it's generic, forgettable, and I hate the meta."

I'm overwhelmed because no one could have known Bay had this movie in him as a director. This film was like call of duty modern warfare with the night time battles with night vision googles. This film is a street warfare protect American land and a secret that nobody knew. Its two hours and 18mins and it's up there with war films at there best. It's riveting and exhilarating its like America last stand at the Alamo but modern, When everything went wrong six men had the courage to do what was right . you won't forget this film in 13 hours the secret soldiers of Benghazi they follow C.I.A personnel and ex military operators who fought back against the rebels who had wages battles to save lives. this film makes your heart race its so gritty puts you in the battle and and seeing the four walls and the soldiers on the roof of the embassy under attack from rpgs and suicide bombers and protecting the place against all that the imagery is brilliant and the graphics are so amazing. 10/10
surprised i wasn't expecting this kind of film"
" Best military thriller to come out of Hollywood in a long time
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,9,"13 HOURS is an exemplary true story war thriller set in Benghazi in 2012, where a number of US contractors working for the CIA found themselves under siege by an army of Libyan militants determined to destroy outside influence in their country in the aftermath of Colonel Gaddafi's demise. The film follows a siege scenario as various tough, trained figures attempt to defend two separate compounds from the murderous militants, and despite a lengthy running time this is never less than edge-of-the-seat great. The real surprise is that it was directed by Michael Bay and is far and away his best movie, head and shoulders above his usual bombastic flag-waving silliness. This goes for taught realism throughout and has some wonderful action set-pieces which utilise amazing sets, effects, and camerawork to put the viewer into the heart of pitched gun battles and the like. Intensity is the keyword here and as such the running time absolutely flies past. I can't recommend this enough; it's the best action-based modern-day military thriller I've seen since BLACK HAWK DOWN and is of a similar quality."
" Powerful, moving and shows how politicians can be blind to what is happening.
",2018-01-04 00:00:00,10,"One of those movies you stumble across and wonder how it didn't get more publilicity. The acting and special effects great, directed and co-produced by Michael Bay. I read that it was one of Michael Bay's less grossing movies, but I would say one of his best personally as it feels real and draws into the story.I admit is did make me stop and think afterwards. About being abandoned, the men who died trying to protect people who should have been supported by their country.I wonder what has been put in place for the future people working OS in a hostile region. In the end did the death of the CIA staff and security make a difference for future compounds. It is a movie that will sit with me for many years."
" War is kind of boring
",2017-12-28 00:00:00,5,"If you were surprised by the recent news that NBC's ""The Office's"" pretty boy John Krasinski is gonna be the next Jack Ryan, then you haven't possible seen his against-typecasting projects such as ""13 Hours"" or, say, ""Promised Land"".This one is a modern war movie about American elite soldiers in Libya at its most dangerous times, defending unofficial CIA base from local militants.Krasinski doesn't kick ass here yet - as Jack Ryan, he has to, surely - but he can shoot bad guys from afar as well as the next guy. Also, tallness and beard help to make a real man out of boyish-looking man, no?Kidding aside, he looks the part - which is good because this is mostly what the screenplay expects from the stars here. This, and couple of video calls to families, to show their human side.It's directed by Michael Bay, so you can expect two things: a lot of explosive action and the movie being longer than needed.At 144 minutes, the never ending war porn does get tiring, especially as the story stays on the shallow side. We don't get to see anything from Libyan side. Maybe the original cut lasting four hours would be deeper and richer content-wise.So it gets too monotonous for my taste - all shooting and no strong story - but I am not particularly interested in modern war movies, so I may not the best judge of ""13 Hours"" and its qualities.But the other critics don't seem to like it much either (50/100 from Rotten Tomatoes, 48/100 from Metacritic), so this does say something. Probably. The site users are kinder: 7.3/10 from IMDb, 82/100 from Rotten Tomatoes, 6.8/10 from Metacritic.What is surprising, is that Bay managed to pull all this off for paltry 50 million USD budget. These days, he's more used to directing movies three-four times more expensive, due to the man devoting his life for ""Transformers"" franchise.By the way, ""13 Hours"" is based on a true story, and a book that was written about it. Filmed in Malta and Morocco."
" Great Movie
",2017-12-28 00:00:00,10,Good movie that brought attention to real events. Good action.
" Michael Bay makes an good apolitical movie (surprisingly).
",2017-12-23 00:00:00,8,"The story behind this movie is fairly well known. The blame laid upon Clinton & Obama routinely spouted by the alt-right as evidence of their heinous natures. Funnily enough, they don't mention the attacks & deaths of US citizens during Bush Jr's term in office. (13 separate incidents and 60 US citizens killed). Where's the hand ringing and finger pointing regarding that? Even the GOP witchhunt found then Secretary of State Clinton blameless for the incident.With that background, I began watching the movie fairly sceptically (especially given it's Bay heritage). I'm happy to say, however, that it wasn't the political aggrandising we've come to expect from the right side of Hollywood. Eastwood and the dross that was American Sniper could learn quite a bit by actually giving facts without the hyper-patriotic BS we've come to expect from a sector of Hollywood.The movie is, instead, a gripping tale of the fate of the PMCs and State Department / CIA operatives during the ordeal in Benghazi. There's even a bit of pro-Libyan blurb towards the end, mentioning that the average Libyan was appalled by the carnage.Some Bayism's occur, obviously, with slo-mo deaths, gore and lots of flashy explosions, but this doesn't detract from the meat of the story. Those who complain about these should really get a life and take it for what it is.Equally so, the macho, bearded 'operators' are actually the sort of men one would expect to see in a high-level PMC. The amateurs at the Embassy compound contrast rather well and are more prevalent in the cowboy outfits like Blackwater and the like. This isn't Bay giving some sort of homo-erotic homage to these men, it's just a reality of the situation. They take extraordinary risks in extremely hostile environments and are very 'Alpha Male' personalities. Once again, deal with it.In closing, it's a lot better than American Sniper and although 'gung ho' is a good ride from beginning to end."

",2017-12-15 00:00:00,10,Amazing movie. I loved the effects of this movie thanks
" A secret that could've been catastrophic!
",2017-11-12 00:00:00,10,"Utterly compelling and outrageously disturbing, ""13 Hours"" most certainly isn't for the weak of heart, pulling no punches it's a realistic retelling of what really happened that day in Benghazi; director Michael Bay who has earned an unwanted reputation in the world of cinema hits back big style and I believe his newest film tells more truth than it does lies.Nobody truly knows what really happened in Benghazi, other than those that were there to live it and the government, and you'll never get the truth from the government. I'd like to say the wizards of Hollywood production did a remarkable job flowering the film up to look as intense and gritty as possible, but realistically they probably didn't need to, as the real life version was more than likely even more intense and nasty, so if anything they must have toned it down to make it more suitable for the big screen. Herein lies a vastly underrated film that should've been acclaimed a Hell of a lot more than it has been, and it gives a glimpse into what life is really like in post-Gaddafi Libya..., how unsettled and dangerous the place is, that the populous seems confused more so than ambitious and nobody knows what the future holds for the country, just a part of the much larger Arab-Spring.A cast of largely unknown actors, but rightfully so, in a film such as this having actors you don't recognise adds to the tension and the realism, whereas having a cast of A-listers would greatly mar the experience somewhat, because if you recognise the actor, you know you're watching a film, if you watch someone you don't recognise, you could in fact be watching a very real documentary, or even better, you could be living the experience in real time through their eyes. Let's just all be thankful that there were six secret soldiers based not far away that were able to come in for the rescue, because who knows what could've happened if these men weren't in fact there."
" Denigration of the U.S. Forces
",2017-10-30 00:00:00,7,"2012 Benghazi attack was a huge topic due to the death of the U.S. ambassador (first in a duty along 33 years). I was studying the history of terrorism at university, so when I saw this movie in a row I knew that I want to watch it. I would not say that all script copies exactly how it was historically, so if you want to reach out for good history background movie on this attack, you'd better not watch it (example: there never was stand down compound order). But if you want to see a good movie in this theme, you can bravely open and watch - 2,5 hours (a bit longer than I expected) - I would not say that this was a lost time. Since this movie was more attached to the book, you'd better read the book first and then watch it. I gave it 7 out of 10 because of the actor's play, filmmaking, and bravery to release a movie about this tragical topic of our history. The one thing that I really dislike in this movie was just the denigration of the U.S. forces."
" Poignant story in the middle of nowhere
",2017-10-26 00:00:00,7,"Nothing better than a movie based on a true story. Certainly when it is about a delicate subject as this one. I'm not going to debate on the necessity of the USA being at war forever since they exist because that is a pointless debate since almost the whole economy of the USA turns around war. Oil and weapons are the major incomes so they will continue going to war with the countries they can see benefits coming from. And no it's not about ending dictatorship or stopping terrorists, they couldn't care less about those things. There are enough dictators and human disasters in Africa where you don't see anybody doing something about it because there is nothing to gain from. 13 Hours though, is a strong movie about a handful of soldiers left alone in the middle of a hostile territory, because there is basically nothing to gain from. It's a poignant story showing the soldiers doing anything they can to save some American civilians. The acting is very good. The action and combat scenes look all very realistic. I truly enjoyed this war movie while it's normally not really the kind of movie I go for."
" The Alamo for a younger generation
",2017-08-31 00:00:00,7,"Pulsating, riveting, terrifying and explosive are the words read as reviews of the Michael Bay action film recreating the siege on the American Embassy and the secret U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya. The experience is palatable every moment under attack, whether on the foreign city streets or awaiting each attack. Panic with each time asked are we expecting friendlies or wondering if the heavily armed local militia will be taking American lives in a matter of minutes. The words you won't hear are drama, spirit, reason or sympathy. This story has been retold in brilliant colorful explosion and bombastic sound. You feel like you are under attack every time, which is the draw of war movies. Repeat viewing comes from the experience our the cinematic event. I'm not sure what that is, other than of the six contracted security agents who did what they've been trained to do with honor and GI Joe bravado.Reducing the Benghazi story to 13 hours doesn't tell the whole story, as we all know and not taking a stand on the issue reduces 13 hours to an experience devoid of meaning for this viewer."
" Such a Terrific Movie
",2017-08-30 00:00:00,9,"Wow this is a incredibly hard worked movie. Actually i was wondering why the rating of this movie went down to 7.3 only. So i went through the comments, the lower rates comments mostly against the American (CIA) invasion to Libiya, Reviews were not related to the Movie.. There were moments were the viewers completely involved to the movie. I mean the scenes like chief waiting to give the order etc..."
" Perfect war movie.
",2017-08-27 00:00:00,10,"I gotta admit that i'm a big fan of modern war - middle east movies (Lone Survivor, Jarhead, American Sniper, Zero Dark Thirty...) So far, this was my personal favorites of the genre. From the beginning till the end it's very realistic and moving. Every actor showed great performance, movie has amazing atmosphere and the combat scenes were exceptional. Everything in this movie was truly amazing. The story, the acting, the action, the drama... Definitely one of the best war movies and yes, one of the best movies of 2010's in my opinion.10/10"
" 13 Hours – yup, that's about right
",2017-06-23 00:00:00,4,"Sometimes a film's title really does tip you off as to what it's going to be about. 'Snakes on a Plane' is one such example. What you see is what you get. '13 Hours' is another. Having watched it, I can definitely confirm that it felt like I had wasted 13 hours of my life watching this. And that's a shame. Despite Michael Bay's notorious reputation since his stint at the helm of the infamous 'Transformers' franchise, I still think he's a reasonably good director (I am just about the only person alive who enjoyed his 'Pain and Gain' film!) so, when I heard he was directing a film about hired security officers in the Middle East, I thought it would be worth a watch.Now, you can probably tell I wasn't impressed and I feel I should probably start listing the various reasons as to why I felt this way. However, I can sum it up in one word: boring. And I could probably leave the review there. I didn't think it was terrible, just boring. 'The Office's' John Krasinski plays the lead security officer and, if you've seen him taking fire from Michael Scott, then you'll probably know that he can hold his own in dangerous situations. He's – as predicted – a likable character who you always feel like you could probably share a beer with. But the film was still boring. Yes, it does show us westerners a window into what life must be like in Middle Eastern countries and what Westerners have to go through when living/working there. The scenery is certainly nice and interesting to look at – certainly a change from watching films set in New York or other recognisable locations. And there is definitely a gritty undertone to the whole story. You can feel the dirt and danger these people have to go through on a daily basis. But I was still bored. Yup, there are some – sort of – car chases and gunfights. These are naturally well executed (in true Michael Bay style), but I've seen all these before and, yes, I was bored.Overall, '13 Hours' is a nice (and dare I say 'accurate?') portrayal of what life must be like in that unstable region of the world, but, ultimately, despite its good points, it just didn't grab me. I was bored (although I'm guessing that this was still better than 'Transformers 5: The Last Knight!')."
" Contains big spoilers!
",2017-06-21 00:00:00,9,"13 Hours is thriller, drama, and action movie. It was released on March 30th 2016. It was directed by Michael Bay.The main actors are John Krasinski, Pablo Schreiber, James Badge is marvelous in the movie. The film takes place in Libya. The story is about a terrorist attack on the base of U.S.A in Lybia and 6 men will save it. The attack is after 11 September 2001.The movie is a drama because the characters on the film die at the end of the movie and the final scene is so emotional but I don't want to spoil too much. The title is 13 Hours because the war on the base of the U.S.A lasts 13 hours.My opinion is that 13 Hours is a very great film and so realistic! The sound design and the action scenes are extremely marvelous and so amazing. The story is original and beautiful and the actors play so well in the movie."
" The Hours
",2017-06-16 00:00:00,6,"Six security guards struggle to protect the American Ambassador to Libya when his compound is attacked in this true story action thriller. '13 Hours' gets off to a strong start with the latest security recruit's car stopped by local militants in an intense, tone setting scene. As the film subsequently introduces each character in depth, '13 Hours' exhibits all the promise of a war movie with a difference. As soon the compound attack occurs though, this potential goes out the window with gunfire and explosions so rapid and nonstop that it is easy to lose track of what is happening. The action does pause at one point with one security guard ruefully stating that ""downtime is the worst"" since it forces you to think about your loved ones and contemplate whether you are fighting for a country you care nothing about - but such thoughtful dialogue exchanges are sadly few and far between with the explosive action resuming shortly afterwards. The action sequences are at least well crafted and Dion Beebe does a great job allowing most of the action to be visible despite nighttime conditions. It is also hard to resent the film's Best Sound Oscar nomination even if campaign violations may have led to the nomination. Overall, this is a decent movie and if not a total success, it is a refreshing attempt from Michael Bay to add some meat to the high octane action stuff he is best known for."
" Reeks so bad I could smell it around the corner
",2017-06-10 00:00:00,1,"""I might not have been to Harvard but I'm pretty sure that was a deal"" Yes, getting an education is a problem to these people. When they say elitism they don't mean wealth, they mean intelligence, the one thing money can't buy. Oh really you want to get bogged down in Libya? The top rated review is some stolen honor asshole? This movie has more jump cuts than Liam Nesson jumping over a fence. Brown and black people, of course are the bad guy and it's Jim from the office... in the last role he will ever play. Real bad ass that guy, did he go to boot camp and then feel like he's an actual soldier? So even in the movie they are saying they want Libya to be free, prosperous, and democratic (i.e. hey let's not get involved). Oh yeah and which party was it that voted to reduce spending on embassy security? Oh yeah, the Republicans. So these people are fighting despite being unfunded by the Republicans, where was that point clarified? Oh that was conveniently left out. Oh let's humanize them a bit, have a kid playing with a tire but a sunset in the back drop so we don't have to see his face, because these kids love playing with tires. Listen, I'm not saying it's racist, I'm saying it's stupid. The ""oh to be a dad who doesn't have to put the work in"" deal again... such a silly trope. Was the soundtrack just leftovers from other movies? Oh the spoil sport is reading a book, how fitting. When everyone else does it they're human garbage, when the Americans do it they're patriotic. This movie and the movement behind it makes me at least understand why people hate us so much. ""none of you have to go, but we're the only help they have"" eh yeah because the Republicans unfunded embassy security. How many embassy attacks have transpired in the last 30 years? Oh about 1 per year? Huh seems like a simple equation but I suppose 1 is the loneliest number and I doubt many of these people can count that high. ""Well, you can't put a price on being able to illuminate yourself"" oh dear well you can't put a price on allowing foreign thugs beat peaceful protesters outside and embassy on US soil either huh? oh yeah and (d e f u n d e d) is a word IMDb"
" Bay Restrained
",2017-06-02 00:00:00,8,"(Flash Review)Compared with the indecipherable action of many of Bay's movies, this wasn't over the top..for him. He took a more factual and documentary angle with this film about the tragedy in Benghazi. And it really didn't take political stance. Never was Hilary's name mentioned nor her title. Only that additional security or reinforcements were requested several times and ignored. The movie was more about the soldiers and how they handled each tense situation. Of course it had the tell- tale scenes of showing soldiers talking or thinking about their families before battle scenes to ratchet up the emotions. It could have been stronger if more backstory was there for why there was so much tension with Lybia to begin with and why was the embassy continually asking for increased security and defense. For a straight-shootin' modern war/battle movie, it was very exciting and enjoyable. It even showed actual footage of the locals apologizing for what happened to our embassy at the end."
" ""A completely different world"". The unimaginable events of war are depicted beautifully in this film, '13 Hours'.
",2017-05-13 00:00:00,10,"'13 Hours', directed by Michael Bay, displays the surreal and heart-breaking events of war in a true story based on the events that took place in Banghazi on 11th September 2012. The film focuses on the soldiers and the people of the unofficial CIA base, ignoring the politics side of the story, placing and maintaining the viewer in the shoes of the soldiers, forcing them to go through an experience that no one would ever imagine going through, just as the soldiers would've been forced to.While Michael Bay is known for creating explosive movies (pun intended), this film really does show that Bay can direct a fantastic film and also carry his own style with it. It is clear in the second act that this film *is* directed by Bay as we are introduced to the shaky-cam that makes our eyes roll around in our heads; the super saturated night shots with neon lights that make us question his editing techniques; and the infamous explosion festivals. Though, with all these questionable styles, no one can question his battle-cinematography choices. Bay does a fantastic job with bringing the viewer into the film and showing us just exactly what it's like to be in the shoes of these soldiers. We have no contact with the politics side of this situation, just as the soldiers don't. The entire second and third act we as the viewer are just as scared, nervous, and anxious as the soldiers in the film are.So, while Michael Bay's film techniques may have been questionable and unnecessary in other films of his filmography, they are put to good use in this film and really add to the surreal settings of war."
" ''We were Warriors''
",2017-05-05 00:00:00,8,"wasn't expecting such a powerful movie from director M.Bay, but here it is, as per some others said already it could have been more , some extra scenes would have explained better why they've been almost ''left for dead'' in Lybia.All, ALL the cast is really good, James Badge Dale nailed it as the commandant of this special unit, all the members are Ex-Seal or black ops, J.Krasinsky did it as well, he wanted to do some drama role and here is navy seal but a newbie in the crew, Max Martini, always rock solid in this kind of role and so are the others.It's powerful as Lone Survivor/2013 was, a different story of course, but 6 men have spent 13 hrs in hell to keep 24 Cia's members alive and themselves while their government was thinking if it would be a good move to , may be, help them. You know the deal, it's more easy to forget about 30 peoples which are not supposed to be here instead having to explain to the whole world why Americans were still in this country.Their opponents are only people with weapons, but rather dangerous because of inexperience, everything can happen and almost will, they have lost 2 of 6 men after a fight against hundreds rebels, they were not super hero, they had a real tactical advantage plus experience.my Title is ""we were Warriors"" because of ""We were soldiers/2002"" but also because all survivors have quit and retired for good after that and must be proud of what they've done that night.If you like good war movies, like Black hawk down, Lone survivor and the like, watch this, it's one of the best."
" Fear the Danger more than 13 hours
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"The movie explains about what happened in Benghazi when unofficially the US people were stationed there. John Krasinski played his role very superbly I haven't seen him like this kind of role in any other his movies he surely dedicated himself for this role and gives extra credit for this movie. The total duration of this movie is two hours and extra minutes, the danger started before the character (jack Silva) enters Benghazi for his work over there. Locals monitored and surveillance the station for more than weeks by planning how to demolish it completely with US citizens on it. To prevent it from happening how the security team guarded their people and not thinking about their own safety and fight for them till the end with the complete patriotism and courage is what inspires me a lot about this movie."
" Benghazi Simplified
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,7,"I am giving this movie only 7 out of 10 stars because I think the producers and writers did not go far enough to clarify why more help did not come. It is nice to see the humanity and heroism of some of the people who were there when the ambassador was attacked. It was informative to see how it unfolded according to those who were on the ground, assuming the storytellers were true to their accounts and their accounts were objective. To be objective means you have to recognize that you don't know what you don't know and you might be wrong about what you think you know. So it was an interesting movie to watch, a sad story, a mess, maybe a stupid mess, but every person who was there had a choice whether or not to be there. Personally, I don't understand why any sane person goes to the Middle East. If you choose to put yourself in the middle of that mess, don't expect me to sympathize or cheer when you survive their tribal egomania. The Middle East is a lost cause, that's what this film confirms. It reminds us that outsiders don't belong there. It shows us why it was a mistake to get involved in their tribal conflicts. We have better things to do - there are many places in this world where the majority of the people and the governments want our help and we do not give them our help - that is the question. Why wasn't there better security for this small group of Americans who shouldn't have gone there in the first place? That's someone else's question, not mine. My question is why are we in the Middle East at all? Why aren't we ""helping"" Africa and/or South America? Why aren't we helping the governments and people who have real problems and who want our help to become more civilized? Why is that conflict - in that region between those tribes who have hated each other for thousands of years - why is that conflict worthy of the sacrifice of our sons and their children? Yes, the people who were there and were faced with aggression and certain death were remarkable in their struggle to survive. It's a bit like cheering for someone who survives diving into a snake pit. Don't dive into snake pits."
" Just the typical Bay unfortunately
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,4,"""13 Hours"" or ""13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"" is an American Oscar-nominated movie from 2016. The director is Michael Bay, which usually means style (especially special effects) over substance, but the fact that Chuck Hogan is the writer here and I quite enjoyed ""The Town"" gave me some hope. He adapted the book by Mitchell Zuckoff. But my hope was dashed relatively quickly. This is a war movie as generic as they come. I may be slightly biased as I am not only not a great Bay fan, but also military films are certainly far from my favorite genre, but as an Oscar nominee I still thought I'd give it a go, even if it is ""only"" in the sound category. It is set in Libya and plays pretty much in the now, not too long ago really, so an interest in current politics may help. Or it may hurt perhaps too as you will recognize the inaccuracies here. Cast includes not too many big names really, even lead actor Krasinski is not a star when it comes to the big screen.Anyway, people who really enjoy army-based movies, even if the story is not really that good, may have an okay time with this one here. One of my main criticisms about this film, however, is that it never elaborates convincingly on the characters in a way where it would make sense to go all emotional at the very end, where we care enough about the characters and are touched by their actions and what happens to them. But this is also a criticism that is valid for several Michael Bay movies. It's perfectly fine he tries to come up with something memorable, but the quality and talent is not there and when the film then starts taking itself so seriously, then that is a huge problem that leaves a negative impact on the entire project really. But admittedly, it is not just Bay's fault, but you also have to blame the writers at least for the same amount. Besides, at considerably over 2 hours this movie also drags a lot. For me, it is definitely one of the weakest Oscar nominees from this year that I have seen so far. I give it a thumbs-down and only recommend it to those that I already mentioned previously."
" 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi.
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,5,"I don't think I would have ever watched this film if it wasn't for its inclusion in the Oscar nominations, although the recipient's name was removed, for violation of Academy campaign regulations, anyway I hoped this fact-based film would be interesting, directed by Michael Bay (The Rock, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, Transformers). Basically in Libya, 2012, a group of ex-military contractors are providing security at an unofficial CIA base in Benghazi. Gaddafi has lost his power and been killed, the climate aftermath has become volatile, with military weapons becoming freely available. Chris Stevens (Matt Letscher), US Ambassador to Libya, makes a visit to the area, staying near the CIA base in a compound, this compound is attacked on the night of September 11th 2012, by hordes of heavily armed locals. The only forces willing and able to defend it are six CIA contractors: commander Tyrone S. ""Rone"" Woods (James Badge Dale), newest member Jack Silva (John Krasinski), Mark ""Oz"" Geist (Max Martini), John ""Tig"" Tiegen (Dominic Fumusa), Kris ""Tanto"" Paronto (Pablo Schreiber), and Dave ""Boon"" Benton (David Denman). Also starring Toby Stephens as Glen ""Bub"" Doherty, David Giuntoli as DS Scott Wickland and David Costabile as Bob ""The Chief"". I think this film was one that had a fairly limited release and as a result got swept under carpet, no wonder it is became Bay's lowest-grossing film, the action sequences are good enough to pay attention to keep pace moving, with a lot of explosions and guns firing, but it just seems like any military movie I've seen before, it is an alright action thriller based on a true story. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound Mixing. Worth watching!"
" For the next 13 hours, the men fought through blood, sweat, and tears to protect all the CIA agents.
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,10,"This piece of art brings the idea of modern war era to life by showing viewers the day-to- day battle that the brave men and women of today's armed forces go through to protect their country from the evil of the world. This the movie earned itself a rating of 5 out of 5 stars for its roller coaster of emotions, and engaging story line that will keep you on your feet."
" Wasted more than 2 hours
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,5,"The movie shows the homeowners as the bad people and the Americans who are guests there as the good people, but the truth is the homeowners have every right to defend their land against any foreigner. The best part is that the movie illustrates the terrorists as one group not representatives of a religion, and shows some of the middle eastern life, for example respect of everyone for prayers even during war when Muslims stop fighting, and giving space for Arabs to speak their language as natives. There is a fatal mistake in the first 4 minutes, a scene when the airplane was landing ""one airline"" and after landing behind Jack Silva ""another airline"" which is very evident and anyone should see it. Anyway, the idea sucks, although it illustrates the bravery of men, because it hinders the fact that Americans were fighting against homeowners regardless of their backgrounds."
" The Magnificent Seven, sorry six, what a lot of Bull****
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,5,"I looked through a lot of the previous reviews before I watched this film and was curious to note that all the 8-10 star reviews came from the USA and the 5 or less came from other countries. Without a doubt this is another typical gung-ho, slice of US propaganda, aren't the US wonderful and we can beat any mother***** who tries to take us on movie. I don't know how close to the truth this film is, I find it difficult to believe six guys with a never ending supply of ammunition could hold off and beat what looked like an army of terrorists. OK I know it's based on a true story but maybe that truth as been stretched somewhat. I mean why even make a film about it in the first place except to tell the world once again how Americans always win the war (I mean look at what they have done with history and WW2) or even if they didn't but let's make it look like they did (see any film about Vietnam). Having said all of that, if you are looking for another shoot 'em up movie in the genre of 'Black Hawk Down', Rambo and the like then this is for you. I give it 5 stars for that and that alone. Suspend your belief and enjoy the action. Once last question, did Alexia Barlier's character actually exist or has she just been crow-barred in because there has to be a female of some consequence in there as well? As she seemed superfluous to me."
" Michael Bay delivers a Masterpiece
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,10,"After watching it for many times, I could not resist myself to review this movie. This doesn't seem like a movie that Michael Bay would have directed. But the minute the explosions and gunfire commences, you will know that yes, this is indeed his film. He is after all, a pro at making things blow up in style. The fire fights are bloody and will get you right in the gut. No effort is spared in depicting the realities of a prolonged gun battle spread out over 13 sleepless, exhausting hours. The cinematography puts you right in the center of the melee. Make no mistake about it. This is an immersive and visceral film.""Things change fast here in Benghazi.""Hollywood biographical war pictures are used as devices to mark significant events of terrorism, a form through which we comprehend accounts of reality and glimpse on the American psyche. Over the last few years we have Zero Dark Thirty (2012), Lone Survivor (2013), and American Sniper (2014), to name only a few. For 2016, Michael Bay leads the strain of contemporary soldiers flick in 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi.This thrill riveting masterpiece not only captivated the lives of these six soldiers and the people trapped between this battle between the Libyan rebels, but Michael Bay did an excellent job with his use of guns and sound system that he always does so well.  This is a masterful film in almost every aspect and certainly in every way that truly matters. Maybe knowing the real life set up and cover up to these events helps elevate the appreciation of what hits the screen but the film holds up well even if a viewer is unaware of world affairs. The premeditated, brutal attack in 2012 on two United States installations in Benghazi, Libya is a dark chapter in not only the war on terror but in U.S. history in general. Expertly depicting the events surrounding those attacks with such tension and emotion is a credit to this film and those that made it. This includes the remarkable cast who each were superb in their roles. And since I am a war movie fan, so this movie has made up to my expectations. This movie is a must watch."

",2017-03-08 00:00:00,10,"I spent 15 years in the military. I served in the Army (I am also a war vet). This movie was amazing! It was intense! I was very emotional watching it. I urge everyone to watch it. And then watch it again. I had to watch it twice because the info exchanged happens so quickly. It is a very long movie, so be prepared for that. It contains a lot of action and bad words. It is probably not suitable for children. I was able to watch it with my Amazon Prime membership. If you must pay a rental for it, it would be worth $5 bucks. Some of the accents are thick, so upon watching a second time I added the subtitles."
" Didn't met my expectations
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,6,"Alright, this is a true story. But I have seen other terror movies based on true events that were much more better done. I think to American Sniper, Lone Survivor or The Hurt Locker. These ones have been directed all damn good and offered lot of suspense. I mean what I missed here was some more precision about the enemy position. Therefore it took too long when action began. It was sometimes a torture to find out what is going on against who. The battle scenes were all well executed with high special effects. For all these reasons I give 6/10."
" The film had a bit of potential, it lacked a better script, I think Michael Bay would do better.
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,2,"13 Hours tells the true story of 6 soldiers who need to defend a post that had received the American embassy, ​​which will be terrorist target, the story is interesting, the movie is good the director should have a good vision and the script is good, unfortunately Both are weak, I have nothing against Michael Bay, to even have fun with some movies of him, but in that he fails too much, well the action scenes of the movie are at least cool, there is a lot of action and explosion, standard Michael Bay , Plus the screenplay is very predictable, not to mention that it is full of cliché phrases, and the film is not exciting, much less exciting, in my opinion the movie had all its potential to be by a good movie wasted, 13 Hours is a Weak, and sins many things, from script to direction, performances are medium, unfortunately it is bad movie. Note 2.4"
" Great Movie
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,9,"13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is a movie directed by Michael Bay so you know what that means. Explosions. Lots of Explosions. The movie is depicted in a great way that displays the attack of the embassy in Benghazi. It starts off a little slow before the last hour of it is an intense, gory battle scene where Navy Seals fight for their lives and the lives of others. On the topic of how gory this movie is, I would not plan on eating popcorn at the end of this movie in the battle that takes place. There is blood everywhere, bodies get ripped to shreds and other brutal injuries that some of the guys take while trying to fight for their lives. I have watched a lot of war movies and TV series so I was used to the blood and gore, but for people who do not like that stuff, I would be cautious to watch this movie. Don't get me wrong though, how realistic this movie is with the gore is what makes it so easy to stay locked into it. You could tell that the actors put a lot of work into making themselves look like real Navy Seals. All of the actors are in the best shape possible with most of them having big bodies with six packs and beards of grown men. Michael Bay uses a lot of low angle shots to make the actors look very powerful as Navy Seals compared to the enemy they were fighting against. I felt like I was watching actual Navy Seals interacting with each other and fighting together. There was one scene in particular in the movie I didn't like because of it being unrealistic. An armored car takes a heavy amount of fire on it making it almost unusable with bullet holes everywhere, all tires flat and the front of the car on fire while still driving miles to safety. Because of this for a second it leaves you wondering how that was possible. This does not take away from the value of the movie, it is just something you should be aware of and that some instances in this movie could make you question a movie from reality which you just have to look past. Aside from that, the acting in this movie was great. Everyone does a great job in their parts. John Krasinski who plays Jack Silva in the movie has a couple emotional scenes where he does a great job of not looking like he is faking a cry. He and James Badge Dale who plays Rone get along in a casual way that makes it look like two buddies who are childhood friends in real life. The whole squad of guys that are Navy Seals in the movie do a great job of looking like one compact brotherhood that solidifies their unit and would make them do anything for each other. Overall, I would give this movie a great rating. It is a Michael Bay film so of course there are going to be some things that are going to make you be like ""Was that really necessary?"" but aside from those instances the story is told very well. I think that the people who went through all this in real life deserved a film about them in their honor and that the actors did a great job of displaying their story. I would recommend this movie to any person who enjoys a good war movie to go see this movie."
" An Above average war true story
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,6,"There has been allot of buzz about this film since it has come out especially considering Michael Bay directed this film and I did enjoy this film though probably not as much as the majority of people did. The premise of this film sees six CIA soldiers having to defend a US embassy from terrorists in Benghazi. John Krasinski plays the lead soldier in this film and I thought he did a really good job, he added depth to his character and gave a powerful performance that managed to rise up his character's cliché story arcs. The rest of the cast does a pretty decent job in this film to add emotional weight to the film., but unfortunately there characters just aren't very interesting and so when the action takes place you don't really care too much about these characters which is a big detriment to the film. The story of this film is pretty intense when the action takes place as you see these guys fighting for there lives against massive odds and it is intense to see. However, the first hour of this film takes allot to get going and you don't really care about the characters as none of the action is taking place. The script in this film has some decent dramatic dialogue and some decent banter between the soldiers in this film. But that traditional Michael Bay awkward humour does take place and it does hurt when it is there but it is nowhere near as bad as the Transformers films. The style of this film when the action is taking place it is great and you are with the characters as they are in this dire situation. However, as mentioned before the first hour of this film is just too slow and mundane for me and the pacing of it just doesn't work for me and really hurt this film. Credit should go to Michael Bay though for at least attempting to make a serious film and doing a pretty decent job with it. Overall if you like war films you probably should give this film a chance i think you might enjoy, otherwise it might be a bit forgettable."
" Surprisingly good
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,7,"Libya, 2012. At an unofficial CIA base in Benghazi a group of ex- military contractors are providing security. In the aftermath of Gaddafi's downfall a power vacuum exists and the climate is volatile. Military weapons are freely available. The US Ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, makes a visit to the area, staying in a compound near the CIA base. On the night of 11 September, 2012, the Ambassador's compound is attacked by hordes of heavily armed locals. The only forces willing and able to defend it are six CIA contractors.Before seeing it, I was very skeptical about this movie. It clearly starts at a disadvantage, being directed by Michael Bay, he of the explosion-centric, all style no substance plots. Plus the timing seemed very suspicious, being released in a US election year, with Hillary Clinton running for President and the Benghazi attack being a controversial mark on her record as Secretary of State. So the movie seemed to have a political agenda.Thankfully my fears were unfounded and the movie is surprisingly good and apolitical. Well told, with a good build up, giving the main characters some depth and setting the scene well. When the action starts it is not all unrealistic heroics but fairly plausible battle scenes. There is a degree of overuse of pyrotechnics by Michael Bay, but it wouldn't be a Michael Bay movie without it.Quite compelling viewing, from a point, as the battle gets tenser and tenser and the odds greater.Solid performances too.Easily the best Michael Bay movie, though not that this says much."
" 13 Hours
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,10,I loved the movie! I will say that it raised my blood pressure 100 points though. Watching Americans under fire after this lying administration told sold many lies and acted so cowardly made me sick to my stomach. The outcome is what you get when unqualified incompetent people are put in charge. This movie should be considered a documentary and proof in court to prosecute clinton and this administration! They pay the taliban/isis to bring home a deserter traitor but couldn't activate units to assist Americans under fire for 13 hours? Total disgrace to America and Americans. The movie shows what happens when unqualified people make decisions in a combat zone concerning ROE. This is a movie that all Americans need to watch to understand how most muslims will act toward non-muslims.
" Fantastic movie!
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,9,"Michael Bay did a great job of bringing the Benghazi story into a film, the action and tension feels real and keeps you as a viewer in suspense (my heart was beating fast!). I didn't understand fully the story of Benshazi before this movie so everything that happened was a surprise for me, comparing this movie to other modern war movies its safe to say it is on the top of the list. this is a good movie to watch with friends or by yourself at home, would not recommend this as a chill out with the GF movie. the movie contains violence and lots of blood, its not as kitschy and emotional as American sniper so i liked it much better. Enjoy!"
" harrowing and terrifying
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,10,"I am always a bit dubious about war/combat films as often they are heavily biased so I approached this film with some apprehension. The slow start didn't engage me straight away, but it became very clear that the whole tone of the film was very different from the usual. The film portrays men in combat without the need to include stereotypes; the characters were depicted in such a way that gave them depth and complexity and almost an ordinariness. There is very little political comment regarding the situation in Benghazi throughout the film, although there were some allusions to the men being abandoned by US military; however, this was done very subtly, as opposed to Oliver Stone in-yer-face, which was actually more effective. I'm not familiar with any of the actors other than Toby Stevens, but the quality of the performances all round was exceptional. The horror and loss were felt in equal measure, and the sense of having to persevere in the face of the odds being increasingly stacked up against them, built up over the course of the final showdown. I disagreed with some of the reviews that the film was too long, and feel the preamble was necessary to the whole plot; these men were intended to be bodyguards and ended up in the middle of a war-zone, so the soft start was entirely appropriate. This is a great film which appears to have been largely overlooked, and I hope it gets more recognition now it can be streamed."
" A Movie That is About More Than Action
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,9,"I walked away from this movie with several emotions. In regards to simply the movie, I thought it was excellent. The actions scenes were very well put together, nothing was over the top and it all was very believable. It reminded my very much of Black Hawk Down with a touch of Saving Private Ryan for reference. I read some about the actual events that this movie is based off of and from as best as I can tell it was very true to real events. The drama, the interaction between the soldiers and the CIA field workers, the scenery and city, everything was very well done.What really blew me away and made this movie really hit me was this was real. These men really went through this. They really faced this adversity, this environment, these odds against him. These men are heroes. I am so humbled there are Americans like these men that protect us, yet go unnoticed and without thanks. We would not have the freedoms we have without men and women like these individuals. It also blew me away in seeing the depiction of the local civilians and how life was for them. The fact they were in a war zone and it was simply seen as ""normal"" to them.For that reason, combined with how well this movie was done, this movie an absolute must see in my book. See this movie, I promise you will walk away thankful you did."
