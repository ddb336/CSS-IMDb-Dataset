" ""3rd Place, 1st Winner""
",2021-01-21 00:00:00,7,"Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.Finally a movie that proves that Melissa Rauch was the hot one on ""Big Bang Theory"".Melissa Rauch carries this one, above and beyond, and she shows her range into dirt comedy and psychological drama without batting an eye, like a champ.The ""angry jerk"" routine gets old pretty fast, but it shifts throughout the movie so it's not unbearable, and for every ounce Raunch gives, Haley Lu Richardson comes back with ""happy idiot"" and it's a wonderful juxtaposition.Special mention to Sebastian Stan for helping Melissa Rauch with one of the most amazing sex scenes I've ever seen, and it's not even about it being dirty. It was as beautiful and funny as it was sexy.The movie is funny, but it does feel as if you're laughing in spite of the movie, and its a special kind of dark humor."
" Yes, well.
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,3,"This is my opinion. If an actress is going all out for a film, etc., They should go all out for a film. Case in point if this film had to have an outrageous sex scene nude I think Melissa should have done it herself. Not a body double."
" This bronze deserves gold!
",2020-07-05 00:00:00,10,"This an entertaining dramedy or dark comedy, whatever you wish to brand it, but the important thing is that you can enjoy a superb perfomance by Melissa Rauch showing that she can do characters totally opposite from her popular character in The Big Bang Theory. Here, in The Bronze, she gives life to the believable character of Hope Ann Gregory developing a great story of redemption."
" With enough THC and alcohol this movie is watchable
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,5,It isn't that good. It isn't that bad. You will probably do something else while this plays in the background. I recommend you smoke THC and drink a lot before watching this.
" The Bronze Review
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,8,It's a good cast and the story is fun. The movie does't try to be more that it is.
" Reminder
",2019-11-21 00:00:00,10,"You can feel this movie when you have lived some of those experiences.
Not beeing able to get on with your life because too anchored with a wondeful past.
This movie brings hope and ads a psychological vision to this problem.
This coule be true not only for athletes but for any person who has been under the light."
" USA!
",2019-10-09 00:00:00,10,My younger sister was an elite gymnast so this type of movie always catches my eye. I went in with no expectations. Hilarious with an amazing soundtrack. It's vulgar but in the best way possible. I love Sebastian Stan but there is a scene where I can't buy this for my mother that drove my sister an hour each way to gym. I hope Melissa and her husband do more amazing films like this.
" Hilarious classic with memorable quotes
",2019-05-28 00:00:00,10,Wife and I loved this movie. Melissa Rauch really makes you hate her and love her at the same time. It had us laughing throughout and didn't fall into typical cliches this genre typically ensure.Highly recommend it.
" My Favorite Olympic Film - The Bronze
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,7,"Miracle on Ice used to be my favorite Olympic film, but this film tops it. It is far funnier; laugh out loud funnier. And even though it is obviously fictional, it really captures the ridiculousness of Olympic sideshows and how American female athletes are supposed to ""behave"". I know almost nothing about women's gymnastics, but the film had a real sense of satirical humor to me. All the cutesy crap that Hope teaches her protege seemed right on the money. Her training tactics looked pretty good as well; like keeping one's legs together when landing. That adds authenticity to the film's background. Many of these athletes also happen to be human beings, and humans have weaknesses. They curse, drink, like sex, and have egos; who doesn't? They are human. That is what makes the film so good. We are looking at a flawed human being who rose to the occasion once, and is trying to rise to the occasion a second time. Ms. Rauch reminded me of Little Miss Firecracker (Holly Hunter), but with no holds barred. The film was well written, had excellent performances from the supporting cast, and Bryan Buckley does a nice job of directing. I liked Raunch's (I mean Rauch's) style. Looking forward to seeing her in more comedic roles."
" Now i want to get Bronze-Medal myself
",2018-09-14 00:00:00,10,"I was watching this movie because in my minor videogame which i play daily (League of Legends) the Bronze Medal is something u dont wanna achive since its the worst Rating u can actually get in this game. So people make alot of jokes over bronze-Players and stuff.
So my expectations were to get some laughs here and there but i did not expect such massive Laughs every 5 minutes into the movie. btw. my wife also enjoyed this movie alot since she loves comedy. 
The humor is very dirty but u trust those actors. Especially Mellisa Rauch plays a ""out of her mind""-performence. I didnt knew her jet but she is the well deserved Superstar into this movie.
So if u like dirty, sometimes flat, sometimes brillant jokes about a girl who find back the way into the brutal reality your are very fine with that movie.
the story is trustable and the actors well choosen.
im no a native english speaker so i apologize for my grammar. Have fun guys, this movie rules."
" Please make THE BRONZE 2 happens MELLISA CAUGH, love this movie !
",2018-08-05 00:00:00,10,"This movie so underrated how could it's just 6/10. this movie must be 6.8 above. I really really enjoyed the movie. the lead character's accent and foul mouthed she got was masel tov for me.this is a kind of movie you watch with your parents or kids, just kidding, no it's not."
" Blah
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,3,"I just saw an extremely unpleasant ""comedy"": The Bronze. It's about this Bronze gymnast turned coach who is constantly angry and mean to everyone including her father and her father manipulates her to train this fan of her's to get the gold in a gymnastics competition. I have not seen a movie this unfunny and mean-spirited in a long time. I hated it."
" A winning sport movie
",2018-04-28 00:00:00,8,"I am surprised that the movie flopped and received many bad reviews. In my opinion it was a really good movie.Melissa Rauch does a great job as the lead character. She is raunchy funny but she is not a one dimensional character and through her depth we see her also as a vulnerable, hurt and lost person.It is both a comedy and drama. And I like the balance between them. We laugh in between but the main parts of the movie are actually not all that funny and more emotional. I did laugh a lot, but I absolutely enjoyed watching Hope rediscovering her love for life, including the great confrontation scene with her father.The movie is better than most sports movies. It is not too sweet and written by the common formula. But it includes some good scenes related to the sport like for example the gymnastics sex scene.The ending also makes one happy. This is what we have been rooting through this movie and it is nice to see it happening."
" Very funny comedy
",2018-03-15 00:00:00,10,"I have laugh from beginning to the end, and never feel boring during this movie.
If more movies could be as good as this one it would be heaven.
I don't understand why people can write bad reviews or give bad rating to this movie... 
It's maybe not a blockbuster, but if you want have fun watching a small funny movie with special people and special story, this movie is made for you!!!
I hope this movie can have the success it deserves.
And I really want to say a big thank you to every body have work on this movie, it makes people feel good to see this kind of comedy, which look like low budget but actually we can feel there is love and passion behind this movie, thanks to have pay attention to all the details and bring us this kind of fun in the life."
" Definitely worth the viewing
",2018-03-14 00:00:00,8,"I saw a preview of this film during another movie, knew I had to watch it. Couldn't find it on Netflix nor did it come on any of the major movie cable networks I had, figured I would never see it. Lo and behold, it was available on demand... YESSSS. This movie is Freaking HI-larious!! My fav character was the Sebastian Stan character, he's totally funny/mean yet smoking hot as the villain. I don't watch ""Big Bang Theory"" so I've never seen Melissa but if she's anywhere near this funny on that, she has to be a factor in y that show's so popular (she and her husband should write more comedies). I'm a big fan of Gary Cole, he's great as always. Some ppl may find this movie off-putting but it's R rated for a reason!! 
W/o spoiling it, there's one scene in particular that will stick with me forever bc for that particular situation, it's everything and more I imagined it to be LMAO!!!"
" It would be enjoyable if Melissa Rauch wasn't in it
",2018-03-14 00:00:00,2,"Her over-the-top 'acting' got so tedious that I never did watch the end. She tried way too hard to be the exact opposite of her Big Bang Theory character that she only succeeded in becoming obnoxious and totally unlikable. Poorest acting outside a high school senior play. You found yourself not only disliking the character, but actually wishing she would disappear. Now, if that was the point of the movie, then congrats. They got it right. But if they expected the audience to have any empathy for her, they definitely blew it. She's played the 'Bernadette' character of TBBT for so long, she doesn't remember what acting is supposed to be."
" Good But Could've Used More Heart.
",2018-02-14 00:00:00,7,"I think this movie really missed it's target audience. While it is breath of foul mouthed air in the usually formulaic and insipid gymnastic movie genre, it goes too far with the raunch. I think if they had pared back the language and nudity to a PG-13 level and replaced it with more character development and heart, they could've been competing for the Gold. Okay, enough of the gymnastic metaphors. Some of this stuff was staring them in face. I mean, they create a central character who's totally self-centered, lacking in schooling and social skills. They could've given her a great scene and a large amount of redemption by revealing her Olympic training robbed her of childhood. She didn't get proper schooling, only had rivals, never friends, never learned how to relate to other people and because of her early victory, was never was allowed to grow up. It was right in front of them but they never go there. As a result Hope lacks depth and the movie doesn't really deliver a satisfying ending. Given that most gymnastic movies target girls who are of age to be learning gymnastics, the language goes too far and the sex scene while being sort of funny is way too graphic for a family with children to watch. They could've accomplished the same goals the movie strives for with a little less of the language and sex and a little more heart. Still, it's a good movie and a fun watch, it's just it could've been very good."
" Quirky and Vulgar
",2017-08-30 00:00:00,6,"(Flash Review)Ever wonder what a former gymnast turns into after they finish their competitive life? This movie is sort of a character study of a successful gymnast who has broken out of a childhood that probably has been void of anything but gymnastics practices and following strict rules. She is extremely vulgar, lacks class, self-centered and has zero experience with boys. During this movie the former gymnast refuses to accept that her competitive days are over and she clings to the fact that she is the hero of her small hometown as she earned a gutsy bronze medal at the Olympics. She is lured into training a local star in hopes of amassing a large payday after the final competition. Will she try her best for the young star's success or will she sabotage this star to retain her local hero status? Overall, the movie doesn't need to be as vulgar as it is. The cursing is blunt and isn't even cleverly worked it as with The Big Lebowski for example. There are some odd and amusing moments but the movie is never laugh out loud funny. There is a very 'athletic' sex scene. The acting is solid and odd to see Bernadette in this role. Strange and profusely vulgar and a break from the typical mold."
" needs to be sharper
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,6,"In 2004, Hope Ann Greggory overcomes an injury to earn an Olympic Bronze medal and becomes the national hero of the Games. In the present, she (Melissa Rauch) is a foul-mouthed, mail-stealing, pill-snorting mess living off of her past glory with her widower mailman father Stan (Gary Cole) as the biggest name in her hometown of Amherst, Ohio. When her former coach dies, she receives the suicide letter promising an inheritance of $500k if she takes over coaching Maggie Townsend (Haley Lu Richardson) to the upcoming Olympics in Toronto. Ben Lawfort (Thomas Middleditch) co-owns the gym with the late coach who Hope derisively calls Twitchy for his facial ticks. Maggie has a struggling single mom Janice (Cecily Strong). Lance Tucker (Sebastian Stan) is the national coach who has a history with Hope.This is a dark comedy that needs a few rewrites to clean up the character's emotional journey. The outline is fine and Hope is a good dark character. I like all the actors. There is some good material here but the humor is not up to snuff. Melissa plays the one-note well. Haley is cute and has good chemistry with Melissa. Thomas Middleditch is a doll and the romance is cute. This is fine but it needs to be sharper."
" From Girl To Woman
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,7,"Not quite useful, just personal opinion.Good movie. In this movie I saw an American who loves her town deeply, a girl who finally wakes up and a woman who grows up.I have watched the movie for extra three times, not for the sex scenes (maybe), but to find out who is Bradley. :)"
" Foul language and lack of morals and values.
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,1,"I'm appalled by the amount of foul language, and lack of morals and values.I have young children that enjoy gymnastics and I would not want them to view this show. Overuse of the ""F"" bomb. A coach that is a horrible mentor. Promotes sex at young ages. Not funny. I'd rather the producer's focus on inspiring up coming Olympic athletes without the sexual innuendo's."
" I don't think I have ever disliked a lead character so much.
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,2,"I have never heard so much cussing in my life. Way over the top. There was absolutely nothing likable about the lead actress. Nothing. I kept waiting thinking there would be some redeeming quality about her. But nothing. And if younger people watch this and think it is normal, no wonder the country is in trouble. I just wanted her father to slap her and kick her out. But no, he was a total punching bag for her. And her ""boy friend"" must have been really hard up for female companionship. Why anyone would put up with her was the question of the movie. Calling ""The Bronze"" a comedy is a joke in itself. A couple funny spots in an otherwise terribly dark film doesn't make it a comedy. A sad excuse of a movie."
" This was so much better than it gets credit for
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,8,"I avoided this movie because I saw a clip of the very raunchy looking ""scene."" I came across it tonight and I was blown away. It is subtle comedy, and yes, it is crass. But it is not crass in the way other movies (like Trainwreck- which I hated) do it to get a laugh. The laughs come from the situations. The character is a spoiled, self-centered, a-hole who cannot accept that her glory days are over (imagine the washed out small town high school quarterback). This is her attitude, her tough-as-nails, no b.s, cause I'm a winner kind of loser. The closest I can compare this is to Danny McBride in ""Eastbound and Down."" So if you like that kind of humor: the kind of pathetic jerk who can't see themselves as anything other than a champ and ends up getting a little heart (and pride kicks) along the way then you will probably enjoy this."
" Gary Cole gives the standout performance
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,7,"The Bronze: An appealing comedy looking at a part of America only seen in Dan Bell's Dead Mall videos and during political campaigns about ""Real America"" . Gary Cole gives the standout performance as the put on dad sporting a Tom Skerritt mustache and the rest of the cast redeems themselves well. The film does bite off a bit more than it can chew trying to replicate two separate Olympic games and missing some easy targets involving NBC style coverage of same. Some might find the main character abrasive beyond redemption but the movie sells that redemption arc adequately. An overall fun film with some good laughs."
