" there seems to be 2 views of this film,very positive,very negative.
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,6,"I have to say this film is boring and badly made.
Rachel Mcadams is impressive in this but the film is confusing and unconvincing.I like Le Carre's work,I did not expect Bond or Bourne but the film is a disappointment.
The film is like an episode of Homeland."
" A Good Spy Movie
",2021-03-08 00:00:00,6,I would like to say Great but it was too predictable. Good performances all round from all the cast though. It wasn't very tense or edgy which i tend to find makes these films that bit better. On the whole an enjoyable watch but don't expect to be blown away
" A most boring film
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,2,"I watched this last night, hoping it would be somewhere in the league of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, which is by far my favorite spy/thiller film of all time (and truly one of my favorite films in general). Wow, was I let down.I find it hard to believe this film wasn't universally panned by critics and audiences alike. It is absolutely boring. About half way through I couldn't wait for it to end. Unlike TTSS, which is also originally from a Le Carre book, this film has none of the cerebral intrigue and none of the taut narrative web-like structure that keeps a viewer immersed within the story. It's one of the most plodding plots I've ever witnessed unfold. Throw in weak direction and bland cinematography and what you have is a real dud. And you might think (as did I ) that with Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Willem Dafoe, the film might at least be carried with strong acting.... but no, it's not. Their characters, like the film, are seemingly unmotivated and wander through as if sleepwalking. PSH, as the main character, is especially un-emotive (with the exception of the last scene). His gruff, chain smoking manner is intended to pass as introspective character development but like the rest of this film, it falls flat, with really nothing much to say."
" There's e is only one way to get through it... fall asleep!!
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,1,"God was I disappointed! I loved Philip Seymour Hoffman, I love thrillers and film noir. I also hoped for a over-the-top bit-part from Willem Dafoe who I also find very enjoyable. So I saw this depressing piece of boredom in the movies. I should have left the theatre but I was there with a date. I felt so low and filled up with hopelessness afterwards that I begged my date to see ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" as a double feature. Just to escape my new found leathery. Two hours of drinking, smoking, looking like nothing matters and talking like they all would have preferred to be born mute. Looking back on this talented actors sad ending, I can't help wondering if Hoffman felt the way he looked in this movie?"
" enthralling cerebral thriller
",2020-10-27 00:00:00,7,"This film raises very apropos questions about all the destruction and wrecked lives left in the wake of organizations purportedly working hard to make the world a safe place, behind layers of hypocrisy and self-delusion.
By the end, I think most audiences will be sharing Phillip Seymour Hoffman's feelings."
" A Most Wanted Man
",2020-10-15 00:00:00,5,"Based on John le Carré's novel and set in a post 9/11 europe.In A Most Wanted Man, Philip Seymour Hoffman gives his final film performance. He plays world weary dishevelled German spymaster Günther Bachmann whose job is to keep track of Islamic terrorists and root out those higher up in the food chain.When Issa a half Chechen and Russian illegal immigrant arrives in Hamburg. He becomes a person of interest to the various spy communities because of his links with the Chechen terrorism.Issa's father was a prominent Russian money launderer who had contacts with a prominent German banker. Issa has been left a major inheritance by his father. Issa rejects his inheritance and wants to give his money away.Bachmann wants this generous act used to snare a respected Muslim philanthropist, Dr Abdullah who is suspected of funneling money to terrorists.However not everyone is on Bachmann's side with people who have their own agendas.A Most Wanted Man is a sluggish muted movie. It revels in its dubious morality, confusion and bleakness.The acting from Hoffman, Rachel McAdams, Willem Dafoe is very good. The story lacks dramatic clout."
" Very good, but obvious ending
",2020-07-15 00:00:00,8,"I am not sure how I missed this when it first came out. Recommended to me by a member of a movie discussion group I am in. I really liked the movie, but for one flaw: the tone of the movie, from the beginning, says ""this is not going to end happily."" Some spy movies, even with unsavory tactics by the heroes, has you smiling at the end...the bad guys, at least, lost. Not this one. I don't mind endings like that, but this was no surprise."
" farewell, Philip Seymour Hoffman
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,7,"There are deaths it is very difficult for me to reconcile with, deaths about which I maintain a degree of disbelief. I can't believe, for example, that I won't see new movies with Robin Williams or Philip Seymour Hoffman. These are such great actors who have created so many memorable roles, so diverse from one film to another, it's still hard for me to accept that there will be no more. It's hard for me to talk about them in the past tense, because death took them by surprise when they still had so many lives to live as movie heroes on screens plus their own. I kept postponing watching 'A Most Wanted Man', even though I'm a passionate of spy books and movies and a big fan of John le Carré. The main reason, of course, is that I knew it was Philip Seymour Hoffman's last great role. Now that I've seen the film directed by Anton Corbijn released in 2014, I should probably start getting used to it. His role is fascinating and the film, which has many other qualities but also some problems, revolves around him.In adapting John le Carré's novel, the screenwriters simplified the story, eliminating for example all British references but especially simplified (and in many respects over-simplified) most of the characters by turning them into typological examples rather than complex, ambiguous characters, always carrying several layers of masks from the novels of the English master writer. It can be said that Günther Bachmann (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the head of the German intelligence team that organizes shadow operations in the pursuit of terrorist organizations and follows the financing channels of Islamic terrorism, is the only character truly belonging to le Carré's universe. Around him is built the conspiratorial intrigue that takes place in the milieus of the espionage services, of the legal and illegal immigrants, of the big finance in Germany. The story is well written and interesting, and as an international spy film 'A Most Wanted Man' can be considered a success. The cinematography is excellent, Hamburg with its cold, fog and shadows looks very good and authentic in Benoît Delhomme's conception, and let's not forget that the film director Anton Corbijn is also a photographer by formation, and author of short films with a strong visual impact.We can, of course, only regret that such talents as Rachel McAdams, Robin Wright or Willem Dafoe do not have more consistent roles. Their characters hold much promise but remain at the sketch level. The same goes for the relationship between the idealistic leftist lawyer (Rachel McAdams) and the Chechen refugee (Grigoriy Dobrygin) who could have been the subject of an entire film, but here it does not convince and does not create emotion. Maybe all this is also due to the fact that the film is dominated by the acting creation of Philip Seymour Hoffman. His Günther Bachmann tries to play a honest role in a dishonest world, agrees to engage in illegal activities in the fight against those for whom the law has no meaning, manipulates and is manipulated, and is aware that those he uses risk being destroyed just by agreeing to cooperate with him even if he tries to save them, but he continues, because there is no alternative. If Philip Seymour Hoffman's life and career had continued, this would have been one of a series of outstanding roles on screen. Being the last role, it gains extra significance - we know when we see his last cry of despair, his last disappointed look thrown over his shoulder. Farewell, Philip Seymour Hoffman!"
" What's even the point of this movie?
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,5,I was hoping that the movie would make a point even till the end. But I just kept hoping. Nothing happened.
" Anti-American Agit-Prop
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,1,"If you subscribe to the narrative that America is ""The Great Satan"", and that even tender, humanitarian Islamic fundamentalists should hate our guts, this is the movie for you. Robin Wright cast as CIA should have been the tip-off. Avoid this predictable anti-American harangue."
" Interesting
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,5,A clearly stated complicated plot with many twists ultimately lacking in dramatic impact. We watch without emotional involvement .
" Great camera, great acting but story leaves you unsatisfied
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,5,"When the film finally concludes you wonder 'was that it??' I think the movie got lost between looking for morale, reason and a storyline. It's like ordering a cappuccino, waiting for ages in anticipation to get served and the waiter brings you an Americano and tells you they run out of milk. I found the whole plot pointless, sorry. Yes Hoffman is a great actor (though as someone pointed out, his character wasn't much far off his real character) and the filming was great but for me this was one of those movies you regret watching."
" BORING!! Talking, talking and talking!!!
",2019-07-20 00:00:00,1,Terrible boring movie. Never seen something like this before!! 2 hours of talking and none sense!The character of Mr. Seymour is not growing at all for 2 hours. Such a waist of time.. there goes my Saturday evening....
" Largely incomprehensible
",2019-05-12 00:00:00,4,"Have to agree with those who found this film incomprehensible, and that applies to the ending too, a stop rather than an ending. By all means make a tight film about (possible) threats to security but make it make sense and make the characters notable for more than, e.g., chain smoking."
" Criminally underrated
",2019-04-29 00:00:00,9,"The complexity of morality on display is uncomfortably delicious and the egotistical simplicity of American behavior is desperate, ugly, and destructively abrupt. The ultimate commentary on uber Western reductionist vision and skepticism in all its subtle glory.
Philip Seymour Hoffman is exquisite ... lumbering, gruff, tenacious, half-enthused, invested, and resigned. A rewatch was warranted. Robin Wright is elegant and uneasy, Rachel Adams is gentle and distraught, Willam Defoe is exact and ambiguous...
RIP #PhilipSeymourHoffman ... in his finest and last hour."
" Another anti American movie
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,1,A well acted spy movie with ulterior motives. In the end you'll yearn to dislike the American government. I believe that is what the movie is really about. The story-line is nothing new or unusual and is extremely predictable. As each scene plays out the viewer is all too familiar with what will happen next. Still worth watching as who doesn't dislike the American government in some form or another? It's just too predictable in scene after scene so I gave it it's lowest possible rating. I felt cheated in the end after spending the time to watch this movie.
" Disappointing
",2019-04-13 00:00:00,3,"I had high hopes for this film but found it quite disappointing. I can't believe I spent an evening watching it. The cast was great, but they could not overcome the meh story and poor editing. The film should have been 80 minutes or less; as it stands, without cutting unnecessary scenes, it feel interminably long. Watch this for the cast, but only if you have nothing better to do."
" Twists and Turns
",2019-02-12 00:00:00,4,"In almost an homage to Alfred Hitchcock, the story is slow to unfold and built around a gray industrial backdrop. Clearly the spies know one another and seek a reputation as a ""team player,"" but while your attention is held in one place, the plot suddenly takes an unexpected turn. It sews up some of the unknown holes sprinkled throughout. I found parts totally unbelievable. The quest to buy respectability, the continuity of acknowledgement of spy after spy in chauffer-driven vehicles is just unfathomably improbable. Props to the late Hoffman, but a poor exposition of ethics and betrayal weight the story down. A root canal that steals 2 hours of your life without novocaine."
" Boring
",2019-02-05 00:00:00,3,"Boring and the ending will leave you saying, ""what was the point?"" it was a total waste of time."
" Blood letting
",2019-02-05 00:00:00,3,Moment by moment this movie is like the difficult and psychological persistent task of picking a scab. Until it bleeds.
" Terrific film
",2019-02-05 00:00:00,10,Excellent adaptation of a John le Carre novel. Philip Seymour Hoffman is supberb - watching this film reminded me of the greeat actor that he was. How we miss him.
" I found myself rooting for the end game!
",2019-01-28 00:00:00,10,"Delishiously, I did not know in advance any cliché ending for this film because the ending situations called for anything but cliché. And it carried the full weight of the story on its back. It fully managed and it felt right.
Regardless of how anyone felt about it, pro or con, it was exactly what should have happened, would have happened, based on all the numbers, criteria, and odds. It had to, don't you see?
Additionally, and on a personal level, it's one of only two movies, Capote(?title?) being the other, that I can accept Philip Seymour Hoffman enough to let him do his job thereby releasing me to do mine as a member of the general audience, not critic, and enjoy the performances in these two pieces.
Interested to hear peoples thoughts..."
" What happened?
",2019-01-23 00:00:00,2,"I watched this movie because I enjoy Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting. And he did a good job with his character Gunther Bachman. However as I watched the movie I kept wondering where they were going with the storyline. I really wanted to like it, but if I had to summarize the movie - it is two hours of watching Gunther Bachman smoke and drink and spy on people. At the end I finally realized that I just wasted two hours of my life. I would steer clear of this one."
" Good acting but sad
",2019-01-23 00:00:00,6,Great cast but the story is a bit too sad to be enjoyable.
" Disappointing Ending
",2019-01-22 00:00:00,5,Beautiful film that ends horribly. Do not get invested.
" Better than Average Spy Flick - A Most Wanted Man
",2018-12-08 00:00:00,6,"Philip Seymour Hoffman gives a convincing performance as a German counter-espionage agent in Hamburg Germany who is tracking down a network of terrorists operating out of that city. The frightening thing about this film, written by John LeCarre, is not the terrorists, but the people who assist them along the way. This would include prominent bankers and lawyers, who through legal loopholes, are able to profit from their association with terrorists without risking their personal freedom. One could almost feel sympathy for one or two of the terrorists involved, but not for the financiers, lawyers, and bankers who help them along. If anything, one roots for the banker and lawyer to get killed in the crossfire. An incisive look into how terrorists operate, and the money-grubbing scavengers who profit from them."
" Buy a can of paint, watch it dry
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,1,"A film that slowly develops interesting characters, and then ends. It's like they made the first chapter of a book into a feature film and threw the rest of the book away. Totally without merit, avoid at all costs. Quite how it got 6.8 on IMDB, well maybe someone hacked the site, I cannot explain it."
" TO MAKE THE WORLD A SAFER PLACE
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,7,"This is a slow moving spy drama. The film tries to create interest by explaining that the 9-11 bombings were planned in Hamburg. Recently a Russian-Chechen Muslim (Grigoriy Dobrygin) illegally immigrates to Hamburg. His father was a bad guy and his motives are suspect. He is represented by a lawyer (Rachel McAdams). Günther Bachmann (Philip Seymour Hoffman) heads up a local agency that is in charge of anti-terrorism. He has ties to the CIA and has bigger fish to fry.This is not an action spy film. They don't shoot guns. The first 50 minutes or so build up the story and characters before it gets into gear and once in gear, it moved slowly along. I love Hoffman, but he sounded like he was attempting to do Churchill. The film has some good drama scenes, a few good lines, and a WTF ending I didn't see coming.For those who loved the novel, or ""Tinker, Tailor..."" this should be perfect for you. Lovers of action spy films will find themselves dozing off as we see a more realistic story.Parental guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" Are people really looking
",2018-10-14 00:00:00,8,Why is Rachel McAdams not listed in the cast. She was major player in the story!
" A most watchable film
",2018-10-12 00:00:00,7,"I read the Le Carre novel long before I saw the film. The film does not wander too far from the book and they get the story within reasonable running time. In terms of performances, Philip Seymour Hoffman takes the Günther Bachmann character by the scruff of the neck and makes it his own. Willem Dafoe doesn't take centre stage much as his character Tommy Brue does in the book.Grigoriy Dobrygin's Issa is not nearly as gratingly irritating as the character is in the book. Another director with a bigger budget may have been tempted to throw in car chases, but these would have brought no added value. Everyone else puts in a shift in to what in the end is certainly a film worth a watch."
" A Most ""-Less"" Movie
",2018-09-19 00:00:00,1,"This is a movie which is everything -less:
lifeless
bloddless
thirll-less
pointless
clueless
plotless
senseless
This is in short, a most boring film, and even with all the luminaries involved, Hoffman, Defoe, Right, McAdams, it never starts. It dies at the start line. 
Never watch this bucket of vapid water. Terrible and tepid fetid junk."
" Where is the story?
",2018-08-28 00:00:00,5,There is literally no story. 5 stars just for Rachel McAdams who was the reason I watched this movie.
" an excellent final out for Philip Seymour Hoffman
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,10,"Director: Anton Corbijin 
Screenplay: Andrew Bovell
Based on a most wanted man by John Le Carre
Cast: Philip Seymour Hoffman, Rachel McAdams, William Dafoe, Robin Wright and Grigoriy Dobrygin 
Plot: when a half-Chechen, half-Russian turns up illegally in Hamburg it puts the German and American Governments on full attack. 
Review: I found this movie interesting because it looks at illegal immigration from America's War on Terror perspective. The direction and screenplay are both really. Both the casting and acting are really good also, especially by Philip Seymour Hoffman in his vary last performance. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars."
" my view on the most realistic spy drama
",2018-08-05 00:00:00,8,"Film-play? = Looks ok, nothing special. camera was shaky at times, boring cuts.
Cast? = PSH was very good at his role of playing unwell tired aged spy. the 'badguy' was likeable as it turned out he was not a bad guy. 
Storyline? = interesting especially as it highlighted not all muslims are badguys.
Score? = n/a
Re-watchable ? = No, one time film
Why I scored down? = nothing spetacular in screenplay or score. 
Why I scored up? = very interesting, showed how not all spy films need to be action filled."
" Gripping Performances, Bland Plot,
",2018-06-28 00:00:00,7,"A Most Wanted Man is a good movie with a reasonably well written plot and a very talented cast. The performances certainly save this film, Phillip Seymour Hoffman blew it away in one of his final roles prior to his tragic passing. It is great to see him take on such a challenging lead role, playing a character that is clearly nothing like himself, taking it on with great ease and making it look effortless. However, as far as films go, I found this very unmoving, it failed to take any risks or do anything that truly surprised me. It is a very predictable, by the book film that did not seem all that interested in doing anything different. Reasonably entertaining. Though the plot falls flat, A Most Wanted Man is saved by great performances, worth the watch for Hoffman alone.A man illegally immigrates to Hamburg, where he gets caught in the war on terror. 
Best Performance: Phillip Seymour Hoffman"
" Big letdown
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,6,"With LeCarre writing, and the talents of Phillip Seymour Hoffman & Rachel McAdams, we were hoping for a classic spy story. But with northern Germany as the backdrop and the glacial pace of the movie, it's a downer from start to finish. A couple of giant holes in the story also never get closed; i.e., why does Rachel McAdams have a change of heart mid-story? Acting is great; storyline and ending left us lacking."
" A Most Wanted Man is yet another mature spy thriller based on a John Le Carré novel.
",2018-03-09 00:00:00,6,"I struggled with Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy but really enjoyed Our Kind Of Traitor. I'm on the fence with this one. There is no denying that this is a well executed spy thriller that oozes maturity. But I found myself disengaged, particularly during the first half. The story is SO heavy and full of dialogue and minor characters that I struggled to keep up with what was happening. It's only in the second half that the plot becomes more focussed. Philip Seymour Hoffman gives an understated performance and is easily the stand out of the film, without a doubt. If he wasn't talking, then he was smoking (seriously his character smoked about 30 cigarettes). Supporting cast were good, I felt Rachel McAdams was unusual casting at first but slowly warmed to her. The direction was solid and every shot was clean and precise. The story itself was relevant and felt very realistic in terms of spy espionage. Hard to call this a thriller though, when really there were no thrills...I wasn't gripped! There are two tense scenes and they each last about ten seconds: the train chase and the taxi escort towards the end...that was it. I wasn't gripped, I wasn't compelled and I certainly wasn't transfixed with what was happening. Sure it's watchable and the technical aspects are there but it was too hard to follow. Everyone was dead pan serious, literally! No one liners or any fun to be had here, it's stern cold stares and monotonous facial expressions. It all seemed too...what's the word...clinical? Like it would've benefited better if it was a TV drama? Look I don't hate the film, I found it to be watchable...just not compelling enough for me to get excited about it. ""A gripping spy thriller""? No, I'm afraid not."
" Cannot get past the horrible accents
",2018-03-08 00:00:00,3,"Beyond the sentiment for Philip Seymour Hoffman, this is a movie that should not have allowed its actors to use accents they cannot replicate.Rachel McAdams attempted accent was ""especially terrible"" as it switched from english, to American, to some kind of eastern European, to even a Hebrew accent. Even PSH's accent switched around constantly throughout the movie. It was unbearably fake and incredibly hard to watch and take the actors seriously.I shut it off halfway through. the Fakeness was overwhelming."
" Slow but compelling
",2018-01-13 00:00:00,6,"If you're into fast paced spy thrillers with lots of techno gadgets and explosions, this movie probably isn't for you. If you're into Philip Seymour Hoffman chain smoking, you're gonna love it.
For everyone else i'd say this movie has a slow pace, but i found it a compelling film with solid writing and acting. If i was supposed to engage in some instant simpatico with the main character Issa (the ""terrorist""), that didn't happen. I never found myself routing for him or caring much about him.
The film is set in Hamburg Germany and this creates a rather grey background that drives focus on the story and not collateral distractions."
" Hoffman's last hurrah
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,8,"""A Most Wanted Man"" is a film most people need to see. I did not intend to write a review, I was saving my time and energy to do that for ""The Awful Truth"" (1937. However I was so impressed with this movie that I felt compelled to write a few lines encouraging others to catch this intelligent, adult and engrossing piece of film-making. I will dispense with the plot. Why? You can get that on IMDb. What I want to write about is this: ""A Most Wanted Man"" is a mature movie and I use that expression as the highest form of a compliment. It is thoughtful, well crafted, smartly constructed and shrewdly paced, building to a shattering finale (The whole film leads to this devastating ending and is worth staying with to experience). John Le Carre' wrote the book the movie is based on and helped to produce. Philip Seymour Hoffman heads an incredibly talented cast-his performance alone is worth watching the film. I know he was facing some personal demons while filming-he doesn't allow them to interfere with his craftsmanship A fitting role to say goodbye with and I am grateful. If for nothing else than to pay respects to Mr. Hoffman, please catch this film"
" Phenomenally Boring
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,6,"A sluggish, low key, mopey, dragged on movie that needed a good shot of Drano. I don't even recall much what happened because after 10 minutes I just let it run in the background and did something else. Every once in awhile I'd look over and watch Hoffman do his best impression of an actor bent on being as boring as possible. Occasionally, he would make a face or say something benign.Hoffman's best performance was probably in Boogie Nights. One of the best movies of the 90's. Sad that this was Hoffman's final hurrah. The man had talent."
" A movie with an unclear plot and many good actors
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,6,"""A most wanted Man"" is a movie about about an alleged terrorist that wants nothing more than give all his fathers money away and be a free man. This story is implemented in a very confusing manner and with too many characters having influence. It is never clear what exactly is happening and what the characters are up to and in the end the purpose of all the work and all the uncovering is unclear. There never seems to be a real ending to the story and nothing really makes sense. The movie is packed with renowned actors and while all of them deliver solid performances, even actors as good as Hoffmann or McAdams seem to feel uncomfortable and they never really seem to find their game. Corbjin is a great director and while he did an amazing job in ""The American"" in every aspect, he seems to try a little to hard in this movie. The cinematography is off and while in ""The American"" the camera did all the work here it is at times confusing and some lingering shots of buildings or in cars don't fit the situation and the movie. Corbjin's style is a great one and I admire it a lot but it just doesn't fit this movie. The whole movie is overall confusing and doesn't really make sense. There are so many exciting plot twists that one could've imagined in this movie, but instead the story is very plain and lacks tension and suspense. In conclusion we can say that ""A Most wanted Man"" is a rather boring movie with a basic plot that never really takes off and the most enjoyable this is to see those great actors together."
" A relatively slow but still gripping spy story
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,8,"In Hamburg the security forces, including a secret unit led by Günther Bachmann, suspect that respected Muslim philanthropist Dr Faisal Abdullah is actually channelling money to terrorist causes; the problem is they can't prove anything. Then Chechen refugee Issa Karpov arrives in Germany illegally; Günther's unit becomes aware of him and more importantly that he has links to terrorists in his homeland. Rather than arrest Issa straight away it is decided to see who he makes contact with. As Günther says, 'you use a minnow to catch a barracuda, you use a barracuda to catch a shark' Issa is definitely considered to be the minnow that might just get Günther the leverage he will need to make Abdullah lead him to a 'shark'. To do this he focuses on Issa's lawyer as she is going to see a banker concerning a large quantity of money that his father, a man he disposed, left him. Günther isn't the only person interested in Issa and Abdullah; other German agencies and the US have them in their sights.Anybody who has watched other adaptations of the works of John le Carré, or read his books, will know not to expect lots of 'James Bond' style action; this is a grittier, more believable, depiction of spycraft. There is a lot of 'waiting and watching', application of pressure and inter-agency politics before the story reaches its surprisingly downbeat conclusion. It could be argued that the film is slow paced but that suited the story and the slowness didn't prevent it from being tense. Philip Seymour Hoffman put is a great performance as Günther Bachmann; it is a tragedy that that this was to be one of his final roles before his untimely death. The rest of the cast impress too; each giving the low-key performances that suits characters who live in the shadows. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to people looking for a modern spy thriller but don't demand lots of action."
" An Epic Swan Song for its lead actor and another thrilling Le Carre story
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,8,"John Le Carre is known for his thrilling tales of international espionage, spies and the gritty underworld of the government. In this haunting tale, late great actor Philip Seymour Hoffman stars as Gunther Bachmann, a veteran German investigator who is assigned to interrogate a young Russian refugee who may or may not be a terrorist.The acting from Hoffman was one of the actor's final performances before his untimely death in Feburary 2014 and is one of the greatest final works by the Oscar winner. Hoffman's Gunther is intelligent, but silent and brooding while being methodical in his techniques. However the man often clashes with his superior who prefers to quickly wrap up the case while Gunther wants to take a ""wait and see"" approach to be sure of his suspicions. The actor's German accent is even solid.The supporting cast around Hoffman is equally engaging. Russian actor Grigory Dobrygin delivers a mostly silent, but powerful portrayal of the suspect, Issa Karpov. Speaking mostly in his native tongue, the actor is compelling making question his motives as much as the likes of Gunther and his associates, Robin Wright as CIA big-wig Martha Sullivan and Rachel McAdams's reporter Annabel Richter. Rachel McAdams delivers one of her best performances as the nosy Annabel, a reporter who throws a kink into Gunther's operation when she begins to aid Issa in his plans. This course of action ultimately plays into the cat and mouse game between the German investigators and their target and culminates in a shocking final act. And rounding out the key players is Willem Dafoe as banker Tommy Brue, the key-holder to Issa's pursuit to go off-grid in Germany. Given the American actor has played a few German characters, Dafoe's accent is solid and never sounds forced or fake. As Brue, Dafoe first plays Brue as cool an confident in his interactions with McAdams' Annabel (even flirting with the visibly annoyed reporter) to a frightened and nervous man when confronted by Gunther and becomes a reluctant pawn in Gunther's plan to capture Issa.The film's narrative is exciting from the minute the camera starts rolling to the final frame. In typical Le Carre fashion, the hunt for Issa Karpov is a cat and mouse game of wits. As Gunther and his team race against the clock to get their evidence, each minute that ticks away gives their prey more and more of a head-start to escape the clutches of the law. The writing pits nearly all the characters against each other as they are forced to choose what side to be part of, this is most true of Rachel McAdams' Annabel, whose interest in Issa and his plight starts out as purely journalistic endeavor for a scoop but as she gets to know the refugee, Annabel becomes Issa's confidant and aides him; becoming a traitor to her country and a wanted woman in addition to the film's title wanted man. A compelling drama that will keep you invested and guessing as to what will happen next."
