" Save time: don't watch this
",2021-04-03 00:00:00,2,"The acting is good. Everything else is an attempt at aligning as many clichés as possible in 90 minutes. The family man of the title is an utter failure of a human being and thoroughly uninteresting. I managed to watch till the end thinking with this IMDB score there had to be something else but no, there is nothing."
" Decent actors miscast - couldn't buy it
",2021-02-11 00:00:00,2,"As one who's seen the corporate sales game up close, each of the principals here are badly miscast. I can't say who is the worst between Butler and Dafoe, both miss by miles. This tainted the rest of the movie for me. The family scenes were passable though even there Butler and Gretchen Mol were not ideal for these roles. The children were great. Excellent performance by Maxwell Jenkins as the son."
" Must see...even if it's just once.
",2020-10-28 00:00:00,10,"Don't listen to the wannabe critics. This was a great film. I don't know if this movie was medically accurate or not. I'm not a doctor. What I do know is that, whether or not they got the medical aspect correct or didn't, that isn't what caught my attention. The emotional feel of the film...did. Their acting was superb and heartfelt. I felt their pain, without question. As a parent, this was unbelievably hard to watch. After a certain point, I just couldn't stop the tears from falling. I would absolutely recommend this film."
" Formulaic - not bad but nothing special
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,7,"I never got around to seeing this movie. I'm seeing it now and it's- eh.Some of the more emotional parts of the script seem a little forced, despite the great acting. I think the written dialogue is a bit old for the age of the children, kids don't speak that way.Definitely, not a wasted 105 minutes, but not the best you'll ever spend."
" Medical joke
",2020-10-09 00:00:00,1,This movise is a medical joke in many ways. ACL patients cannot go out like this due to low immunity. No doctor will tell these statements in the real words. Finally the waking up from a comma.. please spend money wisely next time.

" Gerard Butler Weeper
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,7,I had no idea what it was about do I kept waiting for someone to get kidnapped but this is not the typical GB action flick. His kid gets sick and he learns some lessons. Good performances. Half a hanky.
" What's not to love
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,7,I thought this movie was well made although overly melodramatic for sure. Gerard Butler was ok. My favorite part was Alfred Molina. Also enjoyed the Chicago architecture scenes.
" What you'd expect from a Gerard Butler movie
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,3,"The film lacks structure and believe ability and having a stereotypical Sikhs doctor os an insult.
Plot is weak and rushed. I felt no emotion at all. This could have been such a good film.
It looks like it was made in 2 weeks .
What a shame . Not wanting to be unkind , how does Gerard Bultler get the roles ."
" Great movie

Nice acting with high quality characters."
" Always ignore the critics
",2020-03-14 00:00:00,10,"I went into it not knowing what to expect but this movie thoroughly kicked my ass.Ironically, the pathetic lonely fags they call metacritics gave this film an equally pathetic low score.The best films almost always have low metacritic scores while the worst films have higher scores. It clarifies to me just how sick and dark Hollywood really is."
" Sorry, but it was just not good.
",2020-02-27 00:00:00,2,"The whole thing was pointless. And predictable to some extent. I don't really like Gerard Butler, but I'm not one to be put off by a movie for it. However the whole thing was tedious to watch. Not even good at being a « tear-jerker ». The casting was good, that's a fact. But the drama was really out of place or even, all over the place. And the ending... I still don't understand how someone with a cancer so advanced, to the point of considering fighting it with AIDS, could recover this fast."
" Jerry maguire v2.0
",2020-01-14 00:00:00,7,"Magic stirs men's blood. Sunlight streams down on father and son with closed eyes and outstretched arms in downtown Chicago, and their spirits surge. Corporate headhunter Dane Jensen, the father in this scene, needs such magic. Equal parts charming and ruthless, Dane is on the verge of taking over the company that employs him. At the same time, his young son Ryan is diagnosed with a life-threatening illness. Channeling some inner darkness of lies and deceptions has always provided Dane with an edge against competitors inside as well as outside the company, yet that is not what his family needs now. In fact, they've never needed it. No one does. If Dane ever realizes this, it may come too late.This well written and touching film explores what it means to be a family provider. It takes heart as much as strength, and empathy as much as confidence. The excellent script is written by a former headhunter; it takes one to know one. The film is full of delightful twists and turns, and it goes to unexpected and fascinating places. Part of the magic that stirs Dane's blood, for example, comes from seeing the city and life through the wonder filled eyes of Ryan. The cast, including Gerard Butler as Dane and Willem Dafoe as Dane's boss, is wonderful."
" Nice movie

" Bloody awful, a Christmas film it is not
",2019-12-29 00:00:00,1,"I was talked into watching this borefest over Christmas and boy was it painful.Some people on here are talking about how much 'depth' the characters have. What???Anyone vaguely resembling Gerard Butler in this film needs to be punched in the face.Upon seeing his son's nice hospital ward Gerard Butler says 'wow, nice tv I wouldn't mind catching some leukemia myself'&'Come on, his heart's stopped, so just switch it back on'How on Earth are the only a handful of 1* reviews."
" Movie Critics Without A Clue
",2019-12-28 00:00:00,10,"Can I just say....unless you are Roger Ebert, you hardly can call yourself a film critic. Most ""pro"" critics hardly rated this film. Good for you...read mine because I love movies like this one! You should decide for yourself that family takes priority over career choices! Gerard Butler carries this film so well. The whole cast is believable and yes there are contemptuous companies that care more about earnings than people. Watch this movie and let the story be told!"
" Family Man Reality!
",2019-12-28 00:00:00,10,This uber successful family is faced with the family crisis. Financial success and status seem trivial compared the reality that happens to this family. The cast presented a real story of how the pressure to succeed can be halted when your kid needs you more than your job!
" Sorry on behalf of low reviews
",2019-12-28 00:00:00,10,"This movie is very very well made. Story can be said as old but hey that means how close the matter is to our hearts.It has closed every loop it opened during the plot. Very beautifully written, edited, music, cinematography and has hell lot to teach. Everybody plays a vital, complete and beautiful role."
" Good intentions, bad movie
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,4,"I am really surprised at the glowing reviews. It was hard to find anything enjoyable about this movie. The script was bad, the acting mediocre, and the storyline was lacking. Skip it."
" Surprised by the poor critical reviews

" Surprisingly excellent
",2019-12-23 00:00:00,10,"Honest, care- fully and intelligently written to give light to more than itself. Im glad Im not a critic' with such a profound nose stuck up in air to high to feel. Nope- Rather I'm just a professional human being avg hard working parent, some 50 yrs of experience though. Thoroughly enjoyed the yhoughtfully crafted characters throughout and their honestness and humanity, even the unnoticeable things a child would do naturally. (Tip child passing another at end) This movie was incredibly human- I guess thats why we liked it so much.
Hey peterp of some movie buff site: was it original. Is your dinner original? Poignant, human and real. Whats better than that. Messages us of SEVERAL important values to be kept or reminded of. A great work and thankyou for those who took part in making this valuable work."
" Slightly forced tearjerker
",2019-10-19 00:00:00,5,"With these kind of drama's involving family issues and a character having cancer of some sort, the audience and mass reactions typically tend to be high, and higher than those of critics. One is to believe that if a film is a tearjerker of sorts of deals with a child dying or being really ill, audiences tend to care more and look past the flaws of the film. While critics can tell when a film is generic and its script isn't too good.In this case, this film isn't nearly as good as some of the reviews are claiming. Decent performances and a decent watch but it came across as a forced tearjerker type drama. A lot of it's plot dragged on.This seemed to be a film where there was instant karma. A character does something not good or isn't nice, then something bad occurs. Then a character does a good deed, and something good happens. Gerard Butler's performance was believable but his American accent was noticeable.A Family Man isn't a terrible film but it isn't really a great one either. It is watchable."
" Ironic relate to character
",2019-07-22 00:00:00,8,Not sure how i missed this one but it is a piece of work ! Gerard Butler as a high pressure phone recruiter with a terminally ill child a ruthless boss (Willem Dafoe) and a loving wife. I lost a tear about mid way and a few more later. Good Movie period !! I been self employed since 1998
" Horrible
",2019-05-02 00:00:00,1,"Every once in a while you will a film so forced, so poorly acted, and so blindingly manipulative that positive reactions like a lot of these reviews make you question just how dumbed down and tone deaf most people have become. There is not a genuine moment in this film, and the heavy handed phony dialogue is really laughable in places. I really felt sorry for Willem Dafoe, he must have bills to pay. This thing is excreable."
" Tear jerker

" *puke*
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,4,"Sooo pathetic. Soooo American, makes me wanna throw up."
" Underwhelming but emotional at times
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,6,"Can't think of a better word to describe this film than the one I chose for the title. Just when I really wanted it to kick up and put another gear on, it did exactly the opposite and even made me laugh with how childish this script is.
I mean if you look at this from a safe distance, this is a film about a successful HR man, who is neglecting his family every day because of his jobs demanding hours. Anyways his older son gets ALL, Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and quickly sets on a slippery slope. Dane, Gerard Butler, continues to act the way he was acting, despite now rushing to the hospital instead of his home every night. Meanwhile, at his job he has the reputation of being ruthless and occasionally screws over people in order to remain first in his bosses eyes at the end of each month.
So what do we do? The kid must be dying until the final minutes of the film, at which point he miraculously comes back from the coma and the dad loses his job only to become more successful as an independent HR consultant.
As I said, childish script undermines the viewers perception and offers nothing more than an hour and a half tv time for a casual family viewing.Mistakes were plenty too, but what I really hated was the final moments when the kid is dying and Butler makes way for the daughter to hug him too, as if it was a line in the McDonald's and how obvious all is off course at the end, that the kid will wake up. The fact that he enters the room and the producers think that they maintained tension by not allowing him to know if his son is dead or not, is really the fairy dust of every proper joke.
Mediocre effort, lucid, see-through script, good to very good acting at times, but all is lost inside this casual effort.
The result really is a film that no one will remember ... Skip it if you can"
" Poor Casting
",2018-09-16 00:00:00,5,"No, no, no! I'm not buying Gerard Butler as an American, or as a Recruiter. He overacted in this one, and his attempt at sounding American was silly. Just let him be an Australian.
I'm bored with the over-the-top ""alpha"" sales guy routine in movies. It's such a cliché. At least have someone do it with nuance. Meanwhile I also didn't buy a marriage between the Butler character and Gretchen Mol's wife. The makers touched all the bases. They used a Sikh Indian doctor to dispense Eastern wisdom, a young African American male nurse to share empathy, and a wise, precocious boy to root for. But like most Hollywood movies, they didn't want to have any Western religion or wisdom taint the story.Butler's lead character and Willem Dafoe's supporting character as boss were cartoonish. There was some decent dialog, including some from the wife character about parenting and the need to be there for your family. Overall, they made an earnest attempt to highlight the ""What goes around comes around"" philosophy, and the ""Pay it forward"" concept. I'll give them credit or wanting to encourage a decent value.But I hope they weren't suggesting that all successful people cut corners and live amoral work lives. I suppose not, because a female competitor at Butler's office seems to have succeeded while being relatively honest.Well, the acting was poor, the plot telegraphed, the message cliched, but it could have been worse."
" Well-observed story with new-quality Gerald Butler
",2018-08-07 00:00:00,9,"Not everyone is going to appreciate Mark Williams's ""A Family Man""; and the level of appreciation a viewer does achieve is going to depend more than slightly on a couple of controversial matters. First and foremost is acceptance of terminal illness in a child as a justifiable plot device. The kid here - the part of Ryan Jensen - is Maxwell Jenkins, and he does a very good job. But this is heavy stuff, and might be regarded as a hammer to crack a nut, since this plot is needed to make Ryan's father focus in - at least a bit - on what really matters in life, and what really matters is not (supposed to be) work! The father - Dane Jensen - is played here by Gerard Butler, who mostly leaves behind his typical kind of role (and his Scottish accent). Which brings us to accept/not accept number 2, and I must say I accepted. Indeed, I warmed to Butler as the character - and to the character itself - far more than I anticipated. The mother of the family (Elise Jensen) is a character (well) played by Gretchen Mol, but the real, realistic joy, interest, sadness and ""meat"" of the film - for me at least - is the way she basically/mostly fails to understand/sympathise with the nature of the 21st-century trap her husband has fallen into, not especially because he even wants to, but simply because that is how life is ... NOW.This plotline from real life familiar to many of us goes as follows. A great many people today do jobs whose titles tell you little, and whose descriptions beg the response - ""you can make a career out of that?"" But this is the 21st century, and few indeed of us are logging or mining or making cars or even teaching or nursing or policing or being Marines or doing medical research. (A glorious contrast in the film is by the way provided as Dane comes into contact with Sikh Dr. Savraj Singh (a very good Anupam Kher), whose ""real job"" is saving Ryan's life). But many, many people are not exactly producing very much of utility, beauty or future value, but rather helping move money or assets around, and somewhow magicking income up out of nowhere, with who knows what real resources underpinning it. At the outset, the character of Ed Blackridge - that's Ed's boss - sets this scene clearly, and makes it clear that he has gone further than Dane, in that he doesn't even pretend there might be work-life balance, for work and the lifestyle that goes with it is ALL he has, and that allows him to make plenty, and saves him all those expensive items of expenditure (and precious time) associated with family, education, home and all that stuff. You might expect to find somebody playing this part with panache, and you get Willem Dafoe, who does it JUST RIGHT here.But although Dane (a headhunter as it happens, though it could be a thousand other ""corpo"" jobs) has taken many a leaf out of Ed's book - far more than his wife would like - we know that he works in this kind of field as the ONLY way for most people to ensure better income in modern America (or other countries in fact), and even then with that income being dependent on working nearly ALL the time, and even then most likely straying beyond the threshold of morality at times. This is not actually Dane's choice, this is what the modern world does, as economist Thomas Piketty will tell you. In a conventional, old-fashioned job you will be mostly condemned to struggle at the boundary between the lower middle-class and the working class, with your income going nowhere for years and years - as it indeed has done in the US and UK for a start (hence support for Trump and Brexit), while even going backwards in countries like Italy. A person might escape that trap by working ""flexibly"" (meaning 24/7) and/or (sadly/unforgivably) by working deviously - at somebody else's cost. And that way the family (who hardly knows you) is supplied with a standard of living it takes for granted, but WOULD really and truly bemoan if they lost it (however much they protest otherwise when it suits them). But of course that does not stop them (does not Dane's wife Elise and even his kid) from taking the perceived higher moral ground, and criticising endlessly how the guy works - thereby blaming him for some law of the modern world not of his making.In fact, Dane DOES find a way out - actually helped by Ed (a sweet twist), but in this he does not resemble the majority of the population in America and Europe (at least). There are one or two other plot subtleties, and a beautiful little sub-story about dad-kid quality time focused on the architectural highlights of Chicago - a lovely thing that (like pretty much all of the film) I can very readily understand, appreciate and sympathise with. It's great empathy from the makers. Interesting, then, that this is seen by some as a woman's film - and doubtless the theory is that Elise gets sympathised with. But my male take is of sympathy for Dane (if not for his crude descents into immorality and wrong business practices - which I condemn while nevertheless seeing the reasons). ""A Family Man"" is not going to appeal universally, but - beyond its possibly-exaggerated flirtation with mawkishness or sadness (depending on your point of view) - it does really, really observe the world around us, which is a wrong world that places value on the wrong things. Who knows if that can ever now be different?"
" Unrealistic Scene near the end, this is not how business works
",2018-03-31 00:00:00,4,"When he gets the job for Old Lou, the young woman hiring just said ""I need to expense the 25k fee before the end of the year"". Instead of the Family Man offering to kick back the fee, he offers Lou for free. And she takes it.No, she just said she NEEDED to EXPENSE it.If they had arranged a kickback of the fee that would have been more realistic and Family Man's team would have won the battle.As it is Family Man will have to pay the 25k out of his own pocket anyway.Oh, and he got fired too. Deservedly so. He could have just slipped the recruiter a kickback, and gotten the big promotion.Absurd and DUMB script."
" Good performances wasted on a terrible script
",2018-02-18 00:00:00,4,"A Family Man tells the story of Dane Jensen (Butler), a headhunter who is proficient at his job, and will sink to all lows to be the best at it. He balances that with a home life, which he maybe isn't home for enough, but is putting in the time to make ends meet for his family.His whole world is thrown for a loop when his eldest child is found to have a terminal disease. The story follows an extremely predictable path of redemption.The disappointing aspect of the movie is in what could have been. Butler gives a solid performance as the main character, and Alfred Molina, Willem Defoe, Gretchen Mol, and Alison Brie are all equally up the task. However, the script does such a good job painting Butler's character as ruthless that when it wants to redeem him, all you can do is ask: Really? Similarly Defoe's and Molina's arcs betray they characters.It really is a shame, because the actors deserved better,"
" Moving and Dynamic Performance by Gerard Butler
",2018-02-02 00:00:00,10,"Gerard Butler graces us on the big screen with an astonishingly, moving performance in this heart-wrenching film about finding yourself in this mad mess we call life. Truly a dynamic performance and one worthy of watching."
" 'All families got problems but you only got one.'
",2017-12-28 00:00:00,8,"Writer Bill Dubuque and Director Mark Williams have created a tender, sensitive family story that is well developed and addresses many of the issues we all face. A brilliant cast delivers the goods with style and empathy - and Chicago has never been so beautifully captured photographically as cinematographer Shelly Johnson has accomplished. The musical score is by the always-reliable Mark Isham.As the boss (Willem Dafoe) of a Chicago-based headhunter, Dane Jensen (Gerard Butler), who works at the Blackridge Recruiting agency arranging jobs for engineers, prepares to retire, Jensen vies to achieve his longtime goal of taking over the company going head-to-head with his ambitious rival, Lynn Vogel (Alison Brie). Factors intervene: Dane's close friend Lou (Alfred Molina) is unemployed and desperate for work, Dane's wife Elise (Gretchen Mol) is concerned Dane is not spending time with his family, and Dane's 10-year-old son, Ryan (Max Jenkins), is suddenly diagnosed with Acute Lymphatic Leukemia by the doctor Singh (Anupam Kher) and his professional priorities at work and personal priorities at home begin to clash with one another. Dane spends quality time with Ryan by touring the beautiful architectural wonders of Chicago and Ryan's wise observations set Dane on a new path. Dane finds a job for Lou (at Dane's expense of giving up a headhunter's fee for a friend), and Dane and Elise grow closer. Dane is pulled between achieving his professional dream and supporting his wife and son, who need him now more than ever.Much of the success of the film is attributable to the fine performance by Gerard Butler, but he is enhanced by the performances of the entire cast. A very 'feel good' movie, perfect to restore faith in humankind just when we need it the most."
" An Hour and 48 Minutes I'll Never Get Back
",2017-12-23 00:00:00,1,"There is nothing to redeem this movie. The acting is wooden by all of the characters, nothing to really make you route for anyone and cliched storyline from beginning to end. Anything bad that happens can be undone magically by doing one thing good. People magically change their entire personalities and become good in the end. Not like it really does in real life. Don't waste your time."
" A syrupy sweet and not so original film.
",2017-11-26 00:00:00,5,"""Cancer is not a negotiation, Mr. Jensen."" In ""Olympus has fallen"" and ""London has fallen"" Gerard Butler took care of the president of America and fought against a whole battalion of terrorists. In ""A family man"" Dane Jensen (Gerard Butler) has to fight other demons. On the one hand there's his hectic and energy-hungry job as headhunter. A job he lives for and that keeps him occupied for at least 70 hours a week without exception. And on the other hand there's his charming wife Elise (Gretchen Mol), his son Ryan (Max Jenkins) and daughter Lauren (Julia Butters). A warm family that never lacks anything thanks to Dane's efforts. On a materialistic level that is. Because each and every one of them craves for the presence of a husband and a father figure. Dane may be physically present but in reality he's always busy with his work. This results in displeasure and frustration. Dan always acts like a businessman. When Ryan seems to gain weight, he reacts pragmatically. He just gets up at an inhuman hour to go jogging with his son.The psychological pressure increases when Dane's boss Ed Blackridge (Willem Dafoe) announces that he's thinking of a well-deserved retirement and passes on his position to the person who can present the best annual figures. You don't have to be a Nostradamus to predict what effect this has on Dan. And then it turns out that Ryan's overweight is not because of playing ""Assassin's creed"" for hours while enjoying loads of snacks. It's a swollen spleen due to a severe form of leukemia that causes his waistline to increase. Most viewers (including myself) will start rolling their eyes and shake their heads. Not again another sentimental story with that horrible disease as a central theme and the inner conflict certain people will feel. In this case it's Dan who has to find the right balance between his competitive job and the welfare of his son. And he comes to the realization that no compromises can be made or illegal tricks can be used in such a way that the aggravation of the disease can be avoided.The message is crystal clear after a while. The whole karma and ""What goes around comes around"" principle is really emphatically emphasized. It's all about that moment when you realize that you shouldn't take everything for granted and you start realizing what's really important in life. I wouldn't be surprised if Dan decided to convert to the monotheistic religion of the Sikhs and move to India to live there as righteous Punjab. The transformation from unscrupulous, senseless workaholic into an insightful family man whose priorities suddenly changed completely, was enormously predictable. But despite that predictability and cheesiness, I couldn't resist to look at the rest of this über-emotional tearjerker.In terms of content it was perhaps very syrupy sweet and not very original. But in terms of interpretation I can only respect Gerard Butler whose acting-past is richly filled with action-rich roles where an elaborated character wasn't really required. As King Leonidas in ""300"" and Mike Banning in ""London / Olympus has fallen"" he only had to be fearless, ruthless and determined. So no complex feelings and character traits. The implausible wasn't due to his acting performance, but due to a reasonably weak script. The most eye-catching and praiseworthy acting is for Max Jenkins who, despite his young age, delivers an admirable performance. Ryan was portrayed realistically by this young boy. The rest of the cast took care of the no less important roles, but they weren't not so explicitly in the spotlight. Gretchen Mol as the disgruntled wife (but on the other hand she was in a privileged position thanks to the well-payed job of her husband). Alison Brie, the ravishing rival of Dan. Willem Dafoe as the single, tyrannical CEO whose life was only focused on making loads of money. And Alfred Molino in a modest role as an unemployed engineer at age, who only serves as a toy in Dan's head hunter's game.I am not a hypersensitive type or over-sentimental, but when a drama with this kind of subject doesn't not touch me or moves me, then something is wrong. Either it's totally unbelievable or it's so predictable. I'm afraid the movie just follows a well-known path without deviating, so that it has little interesting to offer. Towards the end, I said to my wife: ""If that little boy wakes up now, I'll eat my shoe."" Never knew that shoe soles were so chewy.More reviews here : http://movie-freak.be"

He is a man we can relate to and in this movie we become invested in him neither hating him nor loving him but sympathizing with him.Something unexpected happens and our investment becomes even heightened, we cry, laugh and cry all over again. You see happiness, sadness and pure life in this movie - well acted. It is also nice to see marriage portrayed in all it's ups and downs without adding too much drama other than that of unexpected life.I loved this movie and would recommend it!"
" Really enjoyable
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,8,"I was pleasantly surprised by how engrossing and perfectly realised this film is, mainly due to I think the excellent screenplay and the wonderful development of not only Gerald Butler's gritty and underhand portrayal of the father, but by the growth of all the characters over all. The only small disappointment was one plot point that seemed too well signposted leading up to it's reveal, but apart from that this is really worth the watch. Excellent all around, plus special credit must be given to the young boy who plays Butlers son. For what I think was his first film, he gave a reserved, balanced and well rounded performance for his age. Well done!"
" Uneven story and unsympathetic characters
",2017-08-01 00:00:00,5,There is a message - it's karma. What goes around comes around. As a headhunter he did bad things to get the numbers at work for example using middle aged Alfred Molina instead of getting him a job. He didn't spend enough time with his family. Then his kid gets sick with leukemia and he eventually does the right thing and voila his kid gets better and he lands on his feet. It's a preachy message and too simplistic. Some faults in this movie: Gretchen Mol plays his rather ungrateful wife. Bitching about his hours when he is trying to provide for his family. So even when her kid gets sick she doesn't seem sympathetic. In fact it's one of the least moving sick kid dramas on film.The world of head hunting is something you don't see on screen that much and kind of doubt it's that cutthroat. Gerard Butler has a bad accent - he shouldn't play an American in movies. Alison Brie is wasted as his out of place pretty rival colleague. Willem Dafoe is the big boss who is kind of a one dimensional horrible boss.Not a must watch.
" There's nothing terribly exciting about it, with the creative bar set that low
",2017-08-01 00:00:00,6,"Ah, the new movie starring Gerard Butler, the poor man's Clive Owen, always up for some good all-American entertainment that makes you think but also makes you smile. This one's about a headhunter whose life revolves around closing deals in survival-of-the-fittest boiler room. He battles his top rival for control of the company, but then his oldest child falls seriously ill. Also starring, Gretchen Mol as the loving but ever-suffering wife, Willem Dafoe as the ruthless boss, Alison Brie as the rival and Alfred Molina as the token solid supporting male character. First and foremost, A Family Man"" is a genre movie, which means it's produced and put together of clichés in hope of finding a suitable mainstream audience. The approach is pretty solid one, using several drama subgenres in order to appeal to wider circle of cinema-goers, including sick child story, a middle class American success story, finding yourself again story and some Wall Street"" type high-octane competence porn. The execution is actually pretty solid too. The able cast are doing their darndest best to act through all the material, and there's a lot of it. 108 minute movie may feel quite a bit longer, at least for those who have seen way too many movies to take all these clichés and workmanlike storytelling seriously. On the other hand, those who still watch movies as just a nice way of passing time, or aren't tired of bland dramas made of middle- class dreams and aspirations, can definitely find some entertainment here. They don't even have to think how to feel because the movie manipulates you in all the right directions at the right time. I am taking a wild guess that ""A Family Man"" is most suitable for girlish audience, but it will also surely feel in the right place when it's 2 am and you're desperately trying to find something new to watch with Butler starring in it. He's a doing a fine job too, the whole result relies on his manly charm and grunting. All in all, there's nothing wrong with A Family Man"". It's just there's nothing terribly exciting either, with the creative bar set relatively low and all. I hope I didn't sound too ironic here or something, I quite liked the movie for what it is."
" Movie, which'll make to think about your life and priorities
",2017-07-27 00:00:00,10,"Very meaningful,deep movie, which makes you to think over about your priorities and make the right decision in life. It's rare to find a movie that would be both touching and entertaining at the same time these days. This movie will be re-watched many times for sure! People who said something bad about this movie obviously have no heart or deep movies are not for them."
" A must see!!!
",2017-07-27 00:00:00,10,"Sometimes we overlooked the truly important things in life and it takes something tragic to open our eyes. This film will be a reality check for everyone who watch it and it makes you appreciate they little things in life that at the end of it all it's what matters the most! A must see, this film is emotional, heart touching and heart warming. I'm not ashamed to say that I shed a few tears while watching it! Gerard Butler, hat off my friend! Great job on this movie! To be honest, the whole cast hat off to you all!!! Amazing movie!!!"
" Bring your tissues and go on an emotional ride with this movie
",2017-07-27 00:00:00,10,"This true to life movie is a ""Must See"". I found myself living through every emotion with these characters . Gretchen Mol was the movie's heart and sole. As a mother and a wife she was a powerhouse of strength!Gerard Butler played his character so raw and honest, when he cried I cried, when his family triumphed I cried again! ""A Family Man"" is an eye opener. In a world where it's easy to become absorbed in power and position it reminds us that family must always come first.Maxwell Jenkins you stole my heart!GO SEE THIS MOVIE ... DON'T FORGET THE TISSUES"
" You have One Family
",2017-06-30 00:00:00,9,"Dane Jensen (Gerald Butler) is a predatory head hunter. He makes time for his family, but seemingly not enough as a phone stays glued to his ear. He has no trouble in taking advantage of people. He has no regrets and seeks no redemption. When a family issue demands his attention, Dane re-examines what is important in life as he learns, ""cancer is not a negotiation."" The film was well acted. You liked Dane even though he was a bit of a scoundrel. The film has a feel good, eye watering ending.Guide: No nudity. No F-words. Sex scene and sex talk."
" Amazing
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,10,"This is truly a heart wrenching film, makes you wake up to family values and a must given well deserved ten stars. Every so often a film comes around that you'll remember forever. For me this is one of them. I hovered over to click and am very glad i did. Enjoy you wont regret it."
" A Beautiful Movie
",2017-06-07 00:00:00,8,"This movie shows in the best form, the true meaning of humanity and compassion. Every character was well crafted out and had depth. The part where lou, after telling his wife he'd finally gotten a job, went into the bathroom and wept for joy, is one of the ""realest"" moments you'd ever see in a movie. This movie deserves a better rating than it's got now. A Family Man helps to remind us all that in the end, we are human before anything else. beautiful movie!"
" A good story about the values that modern society seems to have lost
",2017-06-07 00:00:00,10,"As I was watching this movie, it occurred to me that the story line could be one that professional critics would not like. After the credits rolled, I went online to read.As expected, yes, many users or viewers enjoyed the movie as much as I did. We knew what lines the story would follow - the father obsessed with work and career, the loving home-based mother, the lovable, neglected children who yearn for their often physically and emotionally absent father's affection and attention. As expected too, most professional reviewers had nothing much good to say about it.Yes, all totally formulaic but the way it was handled in ""A Family Man"" made it a very enjoyable and emotional ride with excellent performances from each of the actors. Max Jenkins, as the son Ryan, put in a particularly outstanding performance with a subdued, yet subtle portrayal capturing the emotions that made for a perfect buffer to Gerard Butler's loud, overbearing headhunter-father persona.Each role was played with a small twist that separated them from what we would expect from a family drama. Absent were all the screaming, loud sobs and yelling other than a few which were short and aptly done.Doctor Singh was a nice touch, adding again a more subdued and yet heart-warming approach to the usual on-screen doctor stereotypes. Despite the much-criticized formulaic script, the trips outside of the hospital gave us a deeper insight into the father-son relationship and how it develops very gradually and even almost imperceptibly.Of special interest too were hospital scenes that were bereft of the usual gut-wrenching scenes of the pain of treatment. The one solitary emergency scene was short and nicely cut at the right time without the extended flurry and scurrying that ER scenes entail.I was happy to read a viewer describe how he and the audience in a fully-packed theater gave a standing ovation at the end of a screening, which goes to show that professional critics in general may have become possibly too cynical in their outlook and what stories and movies about life should be like and, in so doing, distancing themselves from us, the people in the street. How many of us do not follow the general formula for life - childhood, education, work, getting married, raising a family, leaving a legacy? If viewers want a story that helps remind us of what we face in life and some of the values that we may have temporarily put into the closet, see this movie. Just don't expect too much. Immerse yourself in the characters.In the end, too, we are reminded that what goes around does come around.I thoroughly enjoyed it and it brought me much clarity as well as food for thought."
" Generic writing and pedestrian performances
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,1,"I had seen some early reviews from professional critics for A Family Man (The Headhunter's Calling) and they seemed exceptionally harsh, but after seeing the film for myself, I would have to say they were actually being too kind. The writing is extremely weak, tedious, and formulaic. It was sad to see Gerard Butler buried beneath its lackluster and generic weight. While some critics do miss the mark in their reviews, I would have to agree with their early assessment on this one."
" Review- possible spoilers
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,9,"I really loved this movie. For the first time, in a long time, I forgot it was ""Gerry"" and really felt and re-lived all Dane's emotions of grief, sadness and denial. I also was able to feel the happiness and gratefulness he came to realize. It hit home for me in so many ways and it was a beautifully acted story. Danes marriage and relationships also feel so familiar. Learning to live in the moment and love the most important people in your life is something so easy for ""us"" to forgot. I loved the backdrop of Chicago and how it played into the story. It was difficult to shift from his career and back to what's going on with his family and I wish there was more continuity- that's the only reason I gave it a 9 out of 10. It was an emotional roller- coaster ride and a movie I'm still thinking about a day after I watched it. The children gave great performances too- the daughter looked so much like my niece that it made it more personal as well. It's a movie I will watch again and won't forget"
