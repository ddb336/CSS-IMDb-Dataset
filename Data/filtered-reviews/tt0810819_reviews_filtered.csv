" A for effort, C for attempt
",2021-04-11 00:00:00,6,"The cinematography, outfit and cast choices were truly phenomenal, but they're not enough to mask the fact that this movie fails to encapsulate the essence of Lilli Elbe. The film depicts that all there was to this life-changing transformation was pain and sorrow, and even the brilliant acting from Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander couldn't cut it. I also feel that Gerda Wegener does not receive enough credit for the role she plays in Lilli's life. The introduction of the character Hans was completely unnecessary and contributed nothing to any character development what so ever. This was an opportunity to tell the inspiring story of Lili Elbe, and her profound relationship with Gerda, but all we got was petty squabbles every 5 minutes. The shot at making this a heartfelt and life-changing movie was a swing and miss, although the effort was undeniable and noted."
" Interesting story, boring movie
",2021-04-07 00:00:00,5,The story of Lili Elbe is very interesting but the movie is rather boring even though there are many talented actors. I think Eddie Redmayne played Lili Elbe very well putting a lot of emotion to the character but I found the movie quite boring in general. I also agree the movie could had been shorter. 5/10.
" The sound track! End of story!
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie in the cinema when it came out and 6 years later the soundtrack is still stuck in my head. That's because the storyline and performance was equally as gripping.
I think Top Gear UK borrowed the soundtrack too in one of the car reviews.
I agree the movie is flawed but should have received an oscar nod on the soundtrack too. But big up Alicia Vikander for the win!"
" Inspiring story, great performance - weak script
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,4,"The story of Lili Elbe is quite a fascinating one, as she was one of the first transgender women who got a sexchange operation.
Eddy Redmayne performance as Lili is moving, but the tale itself is rather bland. Nothing prominent happens throughout the movie, and the script feels week and sometimes pointless. The scenery is beautiful - but it's not enterly Denmark. Nyhavn is, but all the footage from the mountains are from Norway. Denmark is such a flat country, and has absolutely no mountains."
" Moving story but lacks substance
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,6,"It's a laboured, glossy affair in which the complexity and challenge of Lili's process of becoming are buried under a glaze of sumptuous design and arch acting. Yet, it doesn't surprise you quite often as a movie should or such an inspiring story."
" With Looks to Spare
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,6,"I was curious about The Danish Girl, especially since I think Redmayne is such a strong actor and the basic story sounds interesting. The story is interesting but the script doesn't really do it any favors and is weak. Redmayne does give another solid performance but think he perhaps relied a bit to heavily on a just two or three mannerisms for the Lili Elba character and I don't think brought enough nuance to the performance. This films looks great, has beautiful scenery, costumes, and lighting but did really engage me emotionally the way I think all of the elements could have."
" Actress and the actor
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,10,"The best actress I have ever seen and actor does a good job as well as the director of the movie.
My warm regards to all of them specially the actress. 10 out of 10"
" Potential to have been a better film
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,7,"A very enlightening story for those outside the LGBT community, such as myself. Regretfully I felt that the acting was over-directed. The scenery was a bit empirical with decor that had nothing to do with realism in relation to period or location (Paris interiors were certainly not Parisian as well as many exteriors). This made it see more of a biographical documentary like the kind we see on PBS more than a cinematic experience. Amber Heard's performance was banal and unprofessionally interpreted."
" Amber heard
",2020-11-23 00:00:00,1,"I seriously don't know why they had amber heard in this movie? She was odd looking and awkward she can't act at all,they cut the ballet scenes out because she was so bd at dancing...fit the love of Hollywood don't employ her ever again"
" Beautiful scenery, great acting
",2020-11-11 00:00:00,10,"I do not understand why this movie has so many bad reviews. There's especially a lot saying that Eddie didn't do such a great acting job. I think his acting was excellent and he is very pretty. He doesn't pull off looking like a woman very well but I can get past that. The scenery and art in this movie is exceptionally beautiful. It distracts me from the lack of good dialogue. I think it is paced perfectly. I had put this movie off for 5 years because I thought it'd be really long and boring but I was paying attention to it the entire time, never bored. I know nothing about the story behind this movie but I don't even care. This movie could be completely made up and it would still be amazing. The music was also very good. Anyways, I highly recommend this movie if you like long movies that pay more attention to cinematography than the actual plot and story. Which is what I personally like."
" Terrible casting
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,1,Don't ever cast horrible people like Amber Heard again. Justice for Jhonny Deep
" ironically, Eddie Redmayne most recently defended J. K. Rowling
",2020-10-27 00:00:00,9,"When ""The Danish Girl"" got released, I read about it focused on a transgender woman. It wasn't until watching it and reading the background that I learned that Lili Elbe was in fact a real person. As expected, the movie drew controversy for casting a cisgender person as the transgender woman. Even so, I found Eddie Redmayne's performance effective, as well as Alicia Vikander in her Oscar-winning role.More recently, a tragic irony has arisen. Eddie Redmayne defended J. K. Rowling, who has made a series of transphobic comments lately. Seriously, why'd he have to do that?"
" It disappointed me...
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,7,"Half of the film is great, beautiful Europe natural view, pretty paintings. But another half seems like a totally different film. At least add some ups and downs ok?"
" Amzing!!!!
",2020-10-08 00:00:00,10,"I usually don't watch these type of movies but this one was phenomenal. It has a great Cast, splendid Direction and great set designs. This Story is about an Artist who is confused about his sexuality and what he and his wife go through this difficult time. Though Eddie is the main character, the best part of the movie is Alicia's Performance. She kills it! Worth the Oscar! My only issue with this movie is the abrupt ending. Could have been better. Please do check out this splendid piece of Art. ðŸ“ºðŸ“½ðŸŽ¥ðŸŽž"
" ""God made me a woman, but the doctor corrected the mistake that nature made...""
",2020-10-06 00:00:00,8,"""God made me a woman, but the doctor corrected the mistake that nature made"", surely the most memorable line from Tom Hooper's beautiful new film, The Danish Girl. This film, set in the late 1920s, details the life of artist Einar Wegener, (subsequently Lili Elbe), who, with the aid of his long-suffering wife and fellow artist, Gerda, comes to terms with his desire to become a woman in an age of intolerance, and gambles all in agreeing to undergo one of the first ever sex-change operations.Eddie Redmayne triumphs as Einar/Lili, and is surely in for many a commendation. As I sat in the cinema, I felt ashamed at the fact that I was not too familiar with his work, though I do remember him alongside Gemma Arterton in a wonderful BBC adaptation of Thomas Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbevilles, which I saw in a GCSE English class several years ago. It is indeed criminal that I have not yet seen his interpretation of Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything, a performance by which, I'm told, even Hawking himself was bowled over. His transition from Einar to Lili is seamless, as he dons the full female attire, to the extent where I thought I was watching two separate actors. His poise and his every movement are proof that he has studied this part long and hard.I was equally impressed with Alicia Vikander as Gerda. I remembered her from last summer's spy romp, The Man From U.N.C.L.E. Clearly, The Danish Girl makes markedly better use of her serious acting talents. It is quite appropriate that this film is about the lives of two artists, as the film itself is very picturesque. I wouldn't be overzealous in saying that some of the lingering shots of Copenhagen in the film are like paintings.This film is loosely based on a true story and it's release couldn't be more timely here in the 21st century, when we are all too belatedly coming to accept and admire sexual difference. It is faintly reminiscent of the not-so-distant story of flamboyant writer Quentin Crisp's struggle with homosexuality, which was brought to life in the 70s TV film, The Naked Civil Servant, with John Hurt in the title role giving the performance of his career. The Danish Girl is a film about which people will talk at length for a long time to come, and which will continue to bolster Eddie Redmayne's already flourishing career."
" This is just for entertainment.....
",2020-09-24 00:00:00,5,"This is one of Eddie Redmayne's outstanding acting as The Danish Girl, after his Oscar-winning turn as Stephen Hawking.Observe the movie. Lili seemed like a very selfish person, while Gerda was extremely patient and selfless. I agree with this. Because on real life I have seen numerous people destroyed their families due to this disorder.Will u accept ur family member If he has this problem on real life. Answer yourself without second thought....."
" Magical movie
",2020-09-10 00:00:00,10,"Great story, great location, superb acting and powerful music.
Great theme song."
" Slow
",2020-09-02 00:00:00,5,"Tom Hooper definitely likes his period pieces. This, The King's Speech, heck, even Cats. This movie had an interesting story, but man was it slow. At one point, I thought I was nearing the end, and I still had 45 minutes left. I cannot say I can relate to what Einar was going through. It's a very tough decision to make, and it requires a lot of courage and thinking. My favorite character had to have been Gerda (Alicia Vikander). She was a layered character. While she did want her husband to be happy, she also wanted her husband. She was cheated on, and had to deal with losing her husband to becoming a woman, and she still stood by his/her side till the end. She and really this whole movie, had some weird comedic scenes that I didn't really vibe with. Also, the Oscars committed category fraud. Alicia Vikander was 100% a lead actress, not supporting (everywhere I looked agreed). I did have a scene towards the end I was actually surprised about (Lili's death)."
" Worth watching
",2020-08-29 00:00:00,6,A movie worth watching dealing with an important topic
" Good acting but not much else
",2020-08-25 00:00:00,6,"This film portrays some good acting from its two leads. Eddie Redmayne in particular inhabits the role of a confused man who transitions into a woman in an unprecedented surgery. The rest of the film wasn't so great. The dramatic moments were repetitive, it can't make up its mind which character to focus on, the historical accuracy is nearly zero and the soundtrack was embarrassingly maudlin."
" Tugging at my heartstrings
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,8,"I must say, this movie was just so beautifully written. The splendid acting and outstanding cinematography is just wow. The plot only sweetens the deal. I experienced a whole myriad of emotions. From utter happiness to grief to everything in between. I must say, given that I, someone who pretty much doesn't cry at all when watching sad movies/shows, shed a tear for this really speaks for itself.Spoiler alert: The only reason why this is a 9 and not a 10 star is simply because the ending had a bitter sweet vibe and well, I am a sucker for the happy endings."
" Self absorbed introspective
",2020-08-11 00:00:00,4,"Overly long at 2 hours, scenes felt dragged out to their max, which would have be acceptable if I had warmed to either the centrals characters played by Eddie Redmayne.Alicia Vikander should claim all the credit for her role. She claimed my empathy.It was a hard watch for all the wrong reasons. The film was in love with itself. I cannot recommend watching this."
" Review- The Danish Girl
",2020-07-23 00:00:00,4,"A pretty formulaic and mainstream biopic should have been more hard to watch, especially in Eddie Redmayne is transformation.Not so long ago, I would have said that Tom Hooper is making bland and tame movies. I would have said that he was following the stream, but now I can only say that Tom Hooper is a bad director, and if you want a more ""universal"" proof, you just have to watch Cats.In other words, Tom Hooper is proving that to make a good movie, he needs to use ""Ctrl C, Ctrl V"". Thus, I'm probably gonna rate down The King's Speech ."
" Beautiful...
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,7,"Beautiful acting. Beautifully made. I found myself really rooting for both characters to have the ""happy ending ""...."
" You eventually become a complete self
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,7,"Although it is a biography of one person, it is actually a story of two people"
" Far Too Long & Drawn Out...
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,5,"Fails to stop the viewer losing all interest around 30 minutes in. Perhaps it was the deadpan and expressionless wife, the binary emotions of the husband or the disconnected story - but a tale that should have impacted considerably more considering the subject matter - doesn't come close."
" Not a bad movie by any means, but one that seriously disappointed me.
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,5,"Eddie Redmayne and especially Alicia Vikander are so good that they make the unremarkable script mostly worth watching. Mostly.Their performances really carry what's otherwise a pretty underwhelming movie.Maybe I'll like it more on a rewatch, but first I need to want to rewatch it, and I kinda don't, at least not for now.Also, as glad as I am that Vikander won an Oscar for this, it really should have been in the Leading Actress category (and it should have been for Ex Machina, but that's off-topic)"
" A movie you have to see
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,8,Thw amazing work from Tom Hooper combined with ab astonishing performance from Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander truly make the movie amazing. The pacing is good and the emotion from both characters js really put to screen
" pursue the beauty of self.
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,8,"I can get the beauty of the hero dressed in women's clothes, eyes too moving, not very beautiful features but naturally blend a dementors charm, interpretation of the beauty of thousands of possibilities. Not bound, the pursuit of self is the most beautiful!"
" Great
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,9,"I have no idea what is keeping the two protagonists together. On the contrary, it is the freckles that slip into the female's side with almost immeasurable lightness. The beauty is terrible!"
" The danish girl
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,6,"Transgender people are miserable, but Danish girls have more courage. He took huge risks to fulfill his dreams in order to become a real woman. His wife is also admirable, and her husband's gender identity is female. She supports him as always."
" The actors are amazing! A moving story.
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,8,"Already regretted for not watching this movie when it was released last year, though I probably wouldn't like it as much as I do today. Two words would summarise what this phenomenal movie has inspired and convinced me: be yourself."
" The danish girl review
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,9,I am not transgender so I would have no clue what it be like to go through it but I thought this story was really good. It talked about what it like to be one of the first transgender female and I like that. The story line and plot line was good. I love the characters and the development they had. I thought the ending even know it was sad was really good for the story they were trying to tell. The romance part of it was good. I liked that both people were artist. I like that the girl made her husband dress up thing yeah it be fun and I'll be able to paint a girl if I do that. They were just having fun. Then it turns out the husband like it so much that he wants that he wants to be a female now. That part seem realistic to me but then I wasn't born in that time period. This is a transgender story. But think they did a good job telling the story well. I didn't see any problem by then agian I am not transgender. The story was really good. I recommend this to everyone.
" The Danish Girl
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,7,"At first, I kept thinking, is this situation like Einar a dual personality or a transgender? Later, he felt that it was not important to attach any label. He just spent his life to live another life he wanted. He was not a patient. Such people are still marginalized 90 years later, but fortunately at least medical technology can reduce the tragedy. The stars are great, but the story can be dug deeper"
" Chirpy and vibrant atmosphere of the bohemian life that transitions into a meaningful evolution of personal identity and sacrifices of unconditional love.
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,8,"Einar (Eddie Redmayne) is a sensitive, hopeful, submissive painter that lives the unconvential bohemian lifestyle with his wife Gerda (Alicia Vikander). We recognize immediately in the first scenes of the movie the personalities of each protagonist and how they complement. Gerda, the choleric, flirtatious, domineering, fickle wife is struggling to make an impact in the painting scene of 1920s Denmark. They are both creative and free in an atmosphere where emotions are clearly a critical aspect of their work; Einar starts to question his own identity when he participates in cross-dressing modeling and recognizes new sensations that excite him profusely.In the initial stages of his transformation the viewer might intuit that this is simply one of the whims of the bohemian lifestyle, but as Einar starts to discover his emotions and identity the viewer starts to understand the complexity of his situation. It is not simply what demeanor, expressions, persona, image Einar decides to show to world, but his issue becomes multi-faceted as he decides to understand at a deeper level what he wants from life, how he wants to exist.Einar's entire transformation puts Gerda's love and acceptance to the test. It is as if her frolicking nature got a bittersweet turn of events and Gerda had to endure the turbulent process that Lili decided to undergo. It is an interesting turn of narrative where Hans starts to become interested in Gerda, having been his first experience where Einar explores the sexual and emotional affection of men, but I believe the story would have turned too gloomy and depressive for the viewer if we would not get a reward for all the sacrifice that Gerda had to make after following and accompanying Einar in transitioning to Lili. The movie succeeds in carrying an elaborate plot and finding a resolution that would display the importance of identity in the complex self-discovery of sexuality and image. It also poses difficult questions for the viewer in relation to the boundaries of acceptance, unconditional love, identity, and sexuality."
" Disgusting.
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,1,"I have nothing against the transgenders, but this movie make them look gross. The whole story was obnoxious to watch, I can't stand the thing that the male tried female clothes for fun and noticed that he likes wearing them so he kept wearing them, sounds like a huge perversion. It's just so gross. Most of the dialogues later on are so stupid as if protagonist got brain damage. I understand this movie is supposed to make us understand how transgender people feel, but it have done everything the worst way possible, now it feels as if they tried to make us gross of transgenders.By the way, I know a transgender person in real life and his/her story how/why she/he wanted to change gender was very normal and gross at all which makes me question this movie even more."
" The Danish Girl
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,7,"The Danish girl is an emotional saga narrated beautifully by Tom Hooper. To be precise it is a journey of the first person who opted for the sex change operation played effortlessly by Eddie Redmayne. How one's come out of the closet supported by his better half played and nailed it perfectly by Alicia Vikander. Ben Wishaw in his brief role was as good as always.
Due to its bluntness the film faced Ban from many countries including UAE, Oman , Malaysia etc. as the content is not aligned well with the eastern side of the world and that is why I keep that on you to whether go for it or not"
" great performances
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,7,I knew Eddie Redmayne would be great but I had no idea how brilliant Alicia Vikander would be. Great performances based on real events...
" Touching work
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,8,"It's not that Lily lost their lives to be themselves, it's that most people lose themselves to be alive. Every day when we wake up, we have to think about trying to play another person, a good son, a good friend, a good employee, and being ourselves becomes the hardest thing. Fortunately, as long as you are willing, there will always be someone to accompany you."
" True love is not a work of art
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,7,"The mood is slowly brewing. The performance is delicate to the slight shaking of each muscle line. The picture is very beautiful and fantastic. It's just like a dream.
But beauty is not enough.
The story itself is so unique, so unusual, and so shocking. But the connotation isn't deep enough.
True love is not a work of art. True love should be more weighty, which you can't find any simple words to describe."
" I think this movie deserves full marks.
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,10,"The acting of the actor is simply amazing, and the heroine is also good. And I really like the role of the heroine, gentle and strong and equal to people. I really like this movie ."
" Beautiful Movie
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,8,"Amazing performances by Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander. This is an incredibly emotional movie. There were also some scenes which due to the way they were arranged, made it feel they were comic. Nevertheless, I loved the final scene,"
" You won't be disappointed.
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,7,"I really liked this movie. I thought it was so beautiful and such an important story to tell.The realistic balance between both Gerda's support for Lile but also her confusion at first: this was a very taboo topic and barely even spoked about. You could feel Gerda's pain that she wanted to understand and to help but sometimes she just didn't understand or know how to. You can also throughout the movie tell how Lile struggles deeply with coming to terms on how she really feels inside, and how she's always felt inside but she has to surpress it and act like it never happened.I overall definitely enjoyed the movie and I think Alicia Vikander's and Eddie Redmayne's performances were spectacular and I have absolutely no complaints. It was just magical how they brought these two people to life again. There is one complaint though that I could not shake and unfortunately disappointed me towards the end of the movie: Gerda and Lile should have stayed together. Not only would that be most accurate to the real story but also the most accurate to the transgender experience. When someone undergoes gender-conforming surgery they're not becoming ""a new person"" they are simply matching the outside to what has always been there inside of them. Therefore it makes no sense that they didn't stay in love, because Lile was always the same, she was always she. With them breaking up and pursuing their own love lives it's almost as Einar transformed into Lile and became a new person which is with a doubt just inaccurate and wrong. In the real story Lile and Gerda stayed together after Lile found herself and therefore it would of course make the most sense that they should do the same in the movie.I really liked the movie otherwise and I would without a doubt recommend it to other people."
" Book & Movie
",2020-02-22 00:00:00,9,Both book and movie tore at my heart. Bravery and love.
" I Would Have Given I Zeroes If I Could!
",2020-01-31 00:00:00,1,"I recently watched the Danish girl and was very unimpressed. This is obviously a man's interpretation of a man's transition to womanhood..and that is that women are eye candy... and entertainment for men.Einar is a biological male and his transformation to Lili is a biological male's perception or idealized version of what a man would expect a female to be.Gerda is supposed to unselfishly give up her identity and her life to support Lili's metamorphosis. Lili is completely narcissistic in her unrelenting pursuit of her transition ...and devoid of any compassion for his wife, Gerda.Lili is like a caricature of all the stereotypes or male fantasies about what womanhood is or should be...batting her eyelids, making a pretense of shyness or modesty that is intended to be alluring.Lili is an inauthentic woman who apparently finds being sexually objectified meaningful ...with fantasies of giving up her career as an artist to being a domestic servant.Frankly, Lili seemed to mock womanhood altogether. Lili is a male-identified woman...totally circumscribed by ""masculine"" standards ...everything a male would imagine...and ridiculous.Lili seems more auto-aroused by her own reflection then having any alliance with authentic females. Authentic women don't waste there time auto-eroticizing themselves in front of mirrors and practicing pouty lip and tongue movements, hand gesturing seductive self caresses... unless, of course, they are auditioning for a film made by men.As a woman I am offended by Lili's attempts to mimic a peep show stripper who makes a profit by stripping and doing what men want. Obviously strippers are not paid to be their authentic female selves...duh!Male-to-female transgenderism seems to present more as a sexual fetish than any attempt to align with the inequities of the sisterhood.I myself am trying to disengage from the servitude and entertainment value of being a woman and establishing myself as an authentic person.Men presume to be the ultimate judge and authority on femaleness. I choose not to allow men to define me.This movie was just another example of men promoting their stupid concepts of femaleness...just more propaganda from the gender reinforcement police.Of course... men are superior in every way to women. And so it would seem to follow that biological men can transition to make superior women.If we are ever to achieve any sense of authenticity, credibility, and even the right to have a personality of one's own, we women need to wake up, have some self- awareness and quit caving to men's ludicrous expectations.And now we are allowing male-to-female transgenders to be our experts ...defining womanhood. Our future is in male - defined AI (Artificial Intelligence). They have begun the process by artificially altering our appearance on camera...the next step is artificially perfect females created by men. Yuck!"
" The Danish girl
",2020-01-16 00:00:00,9,"What an idea , what a beautiful representation of love, what an amazing cinematography .... I found Nothing to criticize in this movie .... Just felt the characters and the story it's a gem"
" Glad she won the Oscar
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,8,Would not have been as emotional without the performance by Alicia Vikander. It is she who makes this movie memorable for me and all teary-eyed at the very end. I'm glad she won the Oscar for it.
" Wasted potential
",2020-01-05 00:00:00,4,"Overall, I thought this movie was pretty well acted. The dialog felt natural, the characters consistent to how they were written, and the cinematography was beautiful and interesting.I'm also going to ignore for a moment that my research into the movie found it to be completely inaccurate to the actual story, because that's something I've come to expect. Instead I'd like to focus on the main point: the transgender portrayal.It is an incredibly common trope that being trans is like having a completely different person inside of you, with different thoughts and ideas and desires. And it is true that some transgender people portray it this way, because it can be easier to express yourself and remove yourself from a stressful situation. The problem is that you are NOT a different person from one moment to the next... if it were that easy, it would not be as painful when you try to come out.Einar is shown to be madly in love with the wife at the beginning of the movie and just... doesn't love her after beginning transition? It's more common that after the transition, the spouse pulls back because of the perception of sexuality (for instance, a straight woman may have trouble being with a transwoman post transition simply due to the strain on sexual attraction), but I've actually seen more couples try (and succeed) to make it work or come to amicable parting. But that's a tangent.Much of the plot relies on the fact that she was turning into someone else. So much could have been done without that. Even if they wanted relationship issues, barring the fact that transitioning in itself can be a painful and fascinating process without that, you could have just as easily gotten this with sexuality confusion or gender representation or societal pressure or a million other accurate issues that weren't ""oh no, she's a new person now"".I could rant about this all day, but the my biggest contention is that by making her an entirely different person, she ends up villainized... People don't want to love the cheater, the liar, the abandoner. So in the end, all of our sympathy is urged toward Greda, and understandably so by the positioning of the issues. So this movies is not so much about their ""unconditional love"" as it becomes more about a ""trans woman"" who constantly hurts her spouse, who refuses to leave. Any time they might have talked it out or had an actual discussion, something would happen to cut it down and then everything was fine again??No. No. This does nothing to benefit the narrative for women, or the struggle for transwomen specifically. Movies like this only further the idea that transitioning means LOSING the person you love instead of accepting and embracing them.This is getting very long, but I just- if you're looking for an accurate portrayal of what it's like to be transgender, this is not it... This movie, while interesting and well made, will not help you understand. I wish I had a better recommendation for you."
" Beautiful, but disappointing.
",2019-12-28 00:00:00,5,"I was really looking forward to this film--and in the end, I can say that I'm glad I saw it. The music and cinematography are beautiful, truly artful. The actors of Lili and Gerda really drew me in. The whole film packs an emotional punch.But after the credits rolled, my lingering feeling was a sense of how tragically misguided Lili's character is, and how Gerda suffers for it. I'm not sure how closely the events mirror history, and I'll touch on spoilers here, so you're aware.As soon as Einar embraces Lili, Einar becomes ""dead"" to her. She can't even speak from her prior (male) perspective, because she has fully constructed (realized?) an alternate self with completely new wants, needs, goals, thoughts, habits, etc., leaving her previous self behind. There's a point at which a doctor diagnoses Lili with schizophrenia, and honestly, her transformation feels a lot like that sometimes.Reality check: There is no ""Einar"" and ""Lili."" There is one person, with one soul, and one mind, one set of behaviors and feelings, that is always evolving, but IS and ALWAYS HAS BEEN an uncomplicated state of ""self."" Whether your body matches. If you consider your soul to be feminine or masculine, it simply IS. You don't need to reject your partner of 10 years, and forget how and why you ever could have loved them, just because it doesn't ""fit your image"" anymore. You don't need to forget why you ever loved your lifelong passion, and only become interested in getting married to a man and bearing a child, in order to be a woman.And I looked it up: Gerda, in real life, adjusted her thoughts and feelings, to the point where she was painting lesbian erotica and portraits of Lili for the rest of her days. Probably because she had fallen in love with the spirit of a person. Whereas Lili seems to have become obsessed with having the appearance of something.And it's totally fine for your sexuality or gender identity to change later in life, but to say that you ""don't have feelings for your wife anymore simply because you've become a woman, and you're not a homosexual woman."" Well--Reality check again--You said it yourself, Lili, you were always a woman, so you must have had some bisexual feelings once upon a time, when you happily got married, and had regular sex with this person, for 10 years. It would have been way more honest for Lili to say, ""I've done some soul searching, and I'm realizing that I'm not attracted to you anymore, as a matter of fact I'd like to pursue a relationship with a man."" But instead she kept Gerda around for years and years, refusing to communicate with her, on account of ""not being able to tap into Einar's voice anymore,"" allowing Gerda to struggle and make blind decisions and try her damndest to support this ultimately selfish person.I was left with these maddening, saddened feelings after the film. The story can still be appreciated, and being pro-LGBT*, we can be glad of the progress made, but in more ways than one, there was a LOT of tragic ignorance showcased in this film."
" I couldn't feel empathy toward Lily...
",2019-12-20 00:00:00,4,Most of the time I found myself feeling sorry for Einar's wife which made me think maybe I missed the point of this movie. I perceived Lilly as a very selfish person. The acting is good but I just couldn't relate to Lily's character or feel empathetic toward her. Also I felt this subject could have been very touching or moving and for me it wasn't. It was mostly me feeling sorry for Gerda and looking through her view.
" Beautiful strong story
",2019-12-14 00:00:00,10,"The Danish Girl is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen. The movie presents, in a beautiful way, Lili's (Eddie Redmayne) feelings about her gender and struggles she goes through to be herself, to be accepted by society and her loved ones. The story takes place in the early 20th century and therefore marks the beggining of transgender people being recognised. An important part of the story was Lili's wife who, despite her own feelings, was there to support her husband through everything, that is what I call love. I won't lie, the ending made me cry and the whole movie had a huge impact on me. There isn't even a second of my time I would regret spenidng on watching it."
" It made me think!
",2019-12-04 00:00:00,9,"Feelings, emotions, truths and more!
Always is difficult to something first...It's a challenge with yourself and the rest of the world.
I always ask; if something bad or sin why The system put inside on people to make or want it?"
" Just go with it. It's a bit of tragic fun.
",2019-11-30 00:00:00,7,"Despite it being rather jarringly in English, this rich fantasy of identity transition carries a lyrical naivety that is actually rather enchanting.Pretty sentimental and has makes no effort to dig deeper in the phenomenon that gives us the plot, if you just commit to just going with it, you get a very sincere hymn not only to gender essensialism but also to breaking free of the bonds that culture places upon us, at least as much as we can fathom how.A restrained and poignant work that one must remember is based on a fairly loose novel not the actual biography of its main character."
" The Best Film on Subject of Transgender Since ""Boys Don't Cry""
",2019-09-12 00:00:00,8,"Well I finally saw it on cable, September 2019. When ""Boys Don' Cry"" was released in 1999, the film that exploded Hilary Swank's career, the word transgender and the subject matter was relatively new to the general public. ""The Danish Girl"" is a period piece which takes place in France at a time when it was so novel that most most doctors viewed it as a mental illness caused by an imbalance of hormones, often diagnosed as schizophrenia or insanity. Sure there have been many films that take the subject of crossdressing as farce and comedy, dating back to ""Some Like it Hot"". 'The Danish Girl"" blew me away with it's sophisticated take on the subject and it is indeed painful to watch as we empathize with the tortured artist as he agonizingly accepts his true desire to be a woman after his wife playfully crossdresses him for a costume party which opens the floodgates to his self-realization he is a woman trapped in a man's body who goes by the name of Lili -- who does, admittedly, passes as a convincing cute lady. Equally painful is the agony his artist wife goes through during his mental and physical transformation. She loves her husband and he loves her, but as the plot progresses, physical intimacy between them slowly wanes. It is a tragic love story, often embarrassing, often erotic. I likely would have squirmed in my seat had I seen it in a theater audience. Though the artistry of this film and brilliant performances of the leads make this a must-see."
" Lili's legacy deserved better than Redmayne's Oscar-baity pathos...
",2019-08-24 00:00:00,7,"In a heartfelt interview related to his role in ""Tootsie"", Dustin Hoffman recalled that existential epiphany when he was trying for different ways to look convincing as a woman, he realized that the issue wasn't about how realistic he looked but how beautiful. He then realized how demanding was society toward women and he cried at the thought of many interesting women he missed just because he himself applied that pressure on them. The role allowed him to approach the beauty-burden of women and in that fragment of interview lays one truth that the whole ""The Danish Girl"" movie flirts with but never embraces.I know Tom Hooper's film isn't about cross-dressing as much as it's about gender-identity so I'm not comparing the film to ""Tootsie"". However, there comes a moment when the pre-surgery Lili Elbe, played by Eddie Redmayne, enjoys the idea of being believable as a woman and does the best to hide whatever can betray the male assets and deep inside, I couldn't help but feel as though I was watching an actor giving his best shot as a woman, because the initial idea of a woman was to be beautiful, to look sweet and sensitive, to let an innocent chuckle, a few sobbing breaths slip, and Redmayne looked believable in these clichÃ©s situations, but that was all.In a film where you have the wife Gerta, an independent painter and strong female character played by Alicia Vikander, it's rather frustrating to see that a transgender person, once she becomes a woman, abandons all her dreams and makes her best to fit in a female crowd, talking about the last fashion of Paris and giggling like a schoolgirl. In ""Tootsie"", being the beautiful woman was the means, in ""The Danish Girl"", it's the end. When Lili becomes a woman, I'm sorry if this comparison offends but I immediately thought of Mr. Garrison in ""South Park"" who, as soon as he became a woman, enjoyed talking with girls about girly things such as men and the 'curse', it was like joining a club. I know the film goes deeper than that and the real-life story of Lilu is an inspiration for many people who feel trapped in the wrong body, however, I'm blaming the treatment for making the gender identity something as superficial and predictable.For some reason, the film was more effective when it started like a game and Edgar started enjoying the way his modelling inspired a believable lady, having that same Tootsie ""epiphany"", when the struggle to search his identity was within the framework of art, the film could deliver its message without being too forceful, and art was the perfect medium. Think about it, what is the purpose of art, it seeks beauty, goodness and truth, a certain truth as perceived by the artist. Lili starts as ""beauty"" and then she reveals what Lili feels like the best part of herself and then at the end, it turns out that Lili was the truth, the one she's been longing for, she's his, no, her reality. ""The Danish Girl"" starts as a wonderful movie about art and the way it can speak some deep truths about our own personas, only this time, the work of art serves the model's epiphany... it's the idea of being looked at as someone, and then be treated like that someone, and then become that someone, it's a fantastic journey between the realms of reality and art, highlighting the latter's universal language.Tom Hooper had a fantastic material in the original novel written by David Ebershoff, but for some reason, he decided it to turn it into a sober and melancholic drama whose second act is obviously tailor-made to shine a light on an important issue, in other words, it played the Oscar bait thing with the dragging sequences and the sad piano theme. I enjoyed ""The King's Speech"" not because of the stuttering performance or because of its climax (it was only a speech after all) but because it told a terrific friendship story, one can argue that ""The Danish Girl"" is also a tale of love between a woman and her husband who becomes a woman, but Redmayne plays a frustratingly passive character whose efforts to be a woman are only highlighted through sad monologues, cries and sorry for the term, cross-dressing and impressions that are so artificial that they never show what it is to feel like a woman, only to look like one.Redmayne is a good actor but he pushes the pathos button way too far to make for an enjoyable experience and I'm not sure people who belongs to the community like to be their lives seen as eternal reservoirs of sadness. Vikander pulls off a terrific performance but she's clearly the leading character and while the producers put her in the supporting character to win, we're forced to enjoy Redmayne's continual pathos, regretting these true-to-life moments where even when she looked like a man was playfully posing like a woman. The second act is just the typical biopic material chronicling the final years of Lili and although her life is an inspiration, I wished it inspired more than a fade and pale drama from a director who seems to love playing on the safe side. Lili's legacy deserved better than Redmayne's performance."
" What you saw is just a glimpse of history.
",2019-07-09 00:00:00,8,The movie is so good yet so incomplete. After watching this movie i went through some of the pages of history and i found that the life of gerda was as tragic as of lily. They should have given a bit of space for the potray of gerda's life after the death of lily. Lily died after her unsuccessful 5th operation. Anyway everything can't be included within a timespan of 2 hrs so yet again it's a nice movie and one must watch it.
" This Film Is Not For Everybody. Watch At Your Own Risk.
",2019-06-16 00:00:00,6,"I was angry while watching this film. By the end, I had calmed down. I found the end very predictable (as I had actually predicted the ending about halfway through the film). In retrospect, the reason I was angry was because I knew I had been tricked into watching one of those films that, in 2019, we are not allowed to criticize for fear of not being politically correct. And, I had criticisms.My original title for this review was ""The Story Of A Selfish Tranny"", because that IS this story. This is a tale about one person's journey to a new identity and the cost to be paid by his wife. To any free-thinking person, not clouded by self-interest or political agendas, Alicia Vikander ('Gerda') is the sympathetic character that drives the narrative of this film - not her transsexual husband/wife. Gerda's struggle of losing her husband is the theme of this film - not the theme of gender identification.Vikander is great in everything she does and this film is no exception. In fact, she is so good that I hated watching this story. The camera work is top-notch and the settings in old European buildings were fun to watch. Of coarse, James Bond films have good camera work in old European buildings too, and the Bond girls actually have all of their lady parts from birth...If you choose to watch this, have a better reason than I did; I only watched this because I wanted to earn the IMDB badge for reviewing all of the 2016 Academy Award Nominees. This is a good film but not a great film, and there are better films that will leave you happier for having watched them.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

" Amazing Costumes!!
",2019-06-15 00:00:00,5,"Lily, the protagnis, was a first person who had sex reassignment surgery. As I'm female, I imaged how her wife felt in every scenes. So I was depressed. Maybe Lily was awful of the acceptance of her own sex and the new challenge. But I felt like she was a bit selfish against her wife and annoyed her behaviors.I know a similar case nearby. She did married with her husband without knowing that he loves only men. That marriage was just camouflage for him. After the disclosur, she was so hurted and they got divorced. When I heard it, I felt awful. Because it was related with all."
" A wonderful movie about a heartbreaking true story.
",2019-06-14 00:00:00,10,"The Danish Girl leaves out some important parts of the book and Lili's life, such as Gerda's sexuality and Lili's uterine transplant, but it was obviously to make the movie more streamlined. While I find it inappropriate that a cisgender man is cast as a transgender woman, Eddie does an excellent portrayal of Lili's longing and femininity."
" Weird
",2019-06-10 00:00:00,8,"Not a review as such, but something that's weird.It's an english movie, in english that takes place in Denmark, which means that they spoke danish.Also due to the sex change operation, he's a woman, and not a girl. ðŸ¤”"
" It was almost perfect
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,10,"I've loved it. The way in which Einar's and then Lili's psychology was presented was originally and fresh, although, it was a little bit in natural. Any way, it was interesting and pragmatic."
" Certainly Touchy Subject Matter
",2019-05-06 00:00:00,8,"There was a time when I would have seen this as a contrived, shocking piece. But as I've got to know people in the LGBT community, it now has more to do with the reality that people experience daily. Sometimes it is a significant event that brings discovery. This seems to be the case here. I know that some didn't like the portrayal and have decided to sabotage the rating system. I'd rather they didn't review it at all if their motivations are simply to promote their prejudices. While this was in a milieu about which I have no experience, I thought the characters striking and unique and the story also quite remarkable. Take a chance on this."
" This is what I call PERFECT
",2019-04-03 00:00:00,9,"It's more than words to express. Screenplay, Cinematography,Acting...Everything is at its best.I was dissolved in the movie.I was about to cry at end but I could not even shed my tears cause I was haunted by the story.One of my fav"
" Why didn't this movie get the attention it deserves?
",2019-03-31 00:00:00,9,"Let's get to it confidently and frankly. We're in the age of political correctness, and many people find it difficult to adjust to new terms. This movie was released 4 years before the sensitivity of today's political correctness. I could only say that this movie was released a few years too soon.Having said that, about the story itself, it goes back to 1926. Just try and imagine how was the public approach to this sensitive topic back then. So, before continuing reading this, this movie is about a very delicate topic and inspired by a true story. The first transgender goes through with a complex surgery of gender transformation. So, if this is not something you are comfortable with, do not watch this movie. Or, have a very open view about it.Warning: It's really hard to talk about this movie without mentioning ""spoiling"" scenes. So please, try and don't read what's *between stars*. And if you're the type of person who enjoys reading a complete review before watching a movie ignore the said warning.To me, this is a brilliant movie, and I can see that it might not be a popular one. Everything in this movie is a part of the story, and what is a movie but an audiovisual story? From the first scene, one can realize multiple introducing elements about ""Einar"" and ""Gerda"".
Einar is the masterful observant painter, and quite a perfectionist, one might even say obsessive. Einar and Gerda are not just in love or just husband and wife; they're best friends. Einar's fondness of women's fabrique is easily shown in ""his"" touches and gasps that comes with them. *Notice the way Einar's face changes when sensing the texture that reminds ""him"" of her true self*. Einar's perfectionism depicted in many scenes, *painting a landscape over and over to find the right color for the snow, or fixing Gerda's lipstick*, might in fact be the reason that leads her to be as courageous, intrepid and hopeful towards one of the hardest struggles of her life; find herself. Eddie Redmayne has done a perfect job bringing both Einar and Lili to life, to the point that you may get confused as if Eddie went through with this just as her character did. And you may wonder, why didn't he win the Oscar? You can know all about that, asking for a Mr. Leonardo Di Caprio's The Revenant.Gerda is the boss, she's in control both in work and personal relationships. She has a dominant presence and controls her surroundings. Well-deserved Oscar winner Alicia Vikander shows a magnificent talent to realize Gerda. Gerda is in love, and she's in control. *Yet, her dilemma begins when she sees Lili kissing Hans. That's when she understands this has gone too far; she has lost control*.
*My appreciation for the heartbreak Lili has when she realizes Hans knows the ""real"" person in women's disguise, and he likes Einar and not her is very difficult for me to describe. What is emphasized also later that Hans is a homosexual*. Here is the only reason I deducted a point from the perfection; there could have been more discussions about sexuality in this movie. I figured the topic is complicated enough that Hooper, the director, may have intentionally dismissed it.
Costume design and set decorations are incredible in this movie, displaying Copenhagen, Paris, and Dresden, railway stations and hospitals are meticulously perfected. If it hadn't been for the academy's great deal of appreciation for Mad Max: Fury Road, The Danish Girl could have won these two recognitions as well.Acting in this movie is fantastic. Landscapes, and most of the dialogues too. *Goosebumps, even behind my neck, when Lili asks for a night dress, rejected by ""Lili never stays the night"", responding ""doesn't matter what I wear, when I dream, it's Lily's dreams"" *; this is probably my favorite scene.This is a very important story to be told, and Hooper did a good job doing it. if, as some critiques wrote, this movie was such a mainstream one, the ratings would be at least as good as action movies. Clearly, there is many biased opinions about this movie, just as there is a lot of hatred towards the transgender community. Remember what's said: ""haters gonna hate""."
" pure Oscar bait
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,5,"It has one fine performance, so lets nominate it for an oscar, right guys?
-The Oscars"
" Great acting performance
",2019-02-03 00:00:00,7,Fresh of the bat of an Oscar for the theory of everything he does it again with this movie absolutely brilliant acting
" Clearly Brussels not Paris
",2019-02-02 00:00:00,5,"Good acting, original story for the time. But you cannot fool us being in Paris while clearly filmed in Brussels. You're using main sites like the royal gallery, famous art nouveau bars and interiors which are clearly Belgian and not French. Add that with using the Belgian Flemish actor Matthias Schoenaerts who is supposed to be a Parisien, and this all gets quite consufing for Belgian people like myself."
" Not a bad cast but a boring story after awhile.
",2019-01-28 00:00:00,5,"From all the Oscar winning movies from 2016 The Danish Girl was the bottom one for me. With movies like Room, The Hateful Eight, The Revenant or Ex Machina, The Danish Girl is just the least competitive one. Not that Alicia Vikander didn't deserve her Oscar as she's a good actress but the story just didn't do it for me. Even if it's based on real events, Lili Elbe as a transgender pioneer, it's just a story that made me yawn a couple of times during the movie. Eddie Redmayne has the perfect physique to play the role of Lili as he easily could pass for a woman with a bit of make-up on, but his constant girly shy smiling and eye blinking is just annoying after awhile. The cinematography and the acting are good, nothing bad to say about that, but the subject of transgenders is just something completely boring to me. They can do whatever they want with their lives, it's their choices, but in my eyes if you're born as a man you're a man, and that even if you feel like a woman. Nothing wrong feeling like a woman but you're born a man so just deal with it. So yes I might be opiniated about it, like everyone is entitled to his opinions, but that's how I see it and so watching a movie like this one is at one point just waiting for the end to come so that I can watch another and more interesting movie. Next!"

well done !"
" the story of the first trans woman
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,9,Review: The direction is really good but the screenplay is disappointing because instead of focusing on the true story of the first sex-change surgery they chose to take a Hollywood fictional approach which I find very disappointing. The casting and acting are both really good. Especially by Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander. All in all I would give this four out of a possible five stars.
" Beautiful painted
",2018-09-11 00:00:00,4,"A fine movie, but I had my suspicions, when I saw my country depicted with mountains! Denmark is flat as a pancake with the occasional hill. Therefore I looked up the real persons. Well, Lili was quite heavy set, it turns out. So why portray her as a fragile and glamourous icon? It seems to me the aesthetics took over. But I enjoyed the scenes from Nyhavn, where the couple stayed. Those images were quite true."
" Emotionless
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,5,"The Danish Girl is actually an okay film and giving it a five is probably a bit unfair. However, while it does manage to feel like a good film on the outside, inside its just a bland and emotionless disappointment. By this, I mean that the acting performances are very overrated. Eddie Redmayne does a great job as playing the transgender. However, he does not manage to add anything to the character that actually makes the story interesting. Alecia Vikander is okay, but her character isnt exactly interesting as her entire narrative revolves around Redmayne. She has very little development. Her performance is defnitealy not worthy of a supporting oscar, partly because she isnt very captivating and partly because she is a lead character. In general, Danish Girl is not a very interesting film to watch and will leave you feeling nothing at the end of the film other than the relief that it has ended. 5/10"
" Stellar Movie with touching story
",2018-08-23 00:00:00,10,I am in love with Eddie and Alicia. The film is marvelous. The actors play their roles very well. We actually feel their emotions and feelings. Stellar performance by all. I really hoped Eddie would win the Oscar. Loved it!
" It is vivid and warm, touching and sensitive
",2018-08-22 00:00:00,9,"I first watched this film when it first came out. And my first thought was, it was carefully molded. I don't understand why others think the film being bleak, bland or cold is a rather bad characteristic of the film. I'd say, it was intentionally made that way. There is something about this movie that only burning people can understand--that not everyone can. And that's what makes the movie unique, beautiful and sensitive. It is portrayed by beautiful and amazing actors, the art and sceneries in the movie is unspeakable. No words can match how I'd want to express it. The film expressed greatly how it feels being trapped in a body you can't recognize and it was delivered in warmth, one that does not see easily. This is one of my favorite film- and would watch it all over again."
" Extraordinary acting
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,8,"Worth watching, every detail in the movie was just amazing, great performance by both actors"
" Redmayne is superb
",2018-07-24 00:00:00,9,"Based on a true story: In 1920s Copenhagen, Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne) is a landscape artist and his wife Gerda (Alicia Vikander) is a portrait artist. When a female model is late to pose for Gerda, she asks Einar to temporarily replace her, partly dressed in women's clothes. This incident re-stimulates Einar's early desires to live as a female.It is also notable that Einar's transition to Lili Elbe is one of the first known transgender incidents in history.I'm sure my fellow movie buffs can recall times when a film was universally acclaimed and we just didn't see what any of the fuss is about. Sometimes, we even disliked the film. For me, the most glaring cases were probably ""Lost in Translation"" back in 2003 and ""Life is Beautiful"" in 1997.""The Danish Girl"" creates that rare situation in the opposite direction: a film that is universally rated as mediocre or disappointing; but one which I found superb. The naysayers at least agree that Redmayne and Vikander are great in their roles. More on that later.I believe that director Tom Hooper (who helped raise ""The King's Speech"" to such a high level) deserves great credit for elevating the mood in this film to one of intensity mixed with beauty. There is much risk in expressing true identity at a time when the term ""transgender"" did not even exist. The deeper understanding of artists, among others, is on display with kindness and compassion. The beauty of cities like Copenhagen, Paris, and Dresden (with exquisite set designs, cinematography, and music) all contribute to keep the aesthetics of this film at the highest level.But it truly is the acting that makes this film as great as it is. Redmayne's performance alone would have been adequate but Vikander's contribution is more than that of a supporting role. As an emerging artist and as a woman whose marriage is changing in ways that could never have been equaled at that time, Vikander brings great depth to Gerda as her love and support are unyielding during a very difficult and unusual time.Redmayne is truly sensational in this film. This is not a surprise considering his turn in last year's ""The Theory of Everything"" for which he was rightly praised with multiple awards. In ""Danish Girl"", his depth goes even further as he boldly and courageously exposes the sensitivity of a unique and misunderstood soul. From the time he first reacts to wearing women's clothes, the movie is riveting as he easily conveys nuance in his facial expressions and takes great risks to be truthful and authentic.As Charlize Theron did with ""Monster"", Redmanyne's sublime performance raises a fine film to an even greater level.OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT: Lead Performance by Eddie Redmayne"
" Dispose of yourself, no matter what for
",2018-07-23 00:00:00,8,"Complicity, the purest complicity is the league that leads people to reveal themselves to each other, to influence each other deeply, to deepen their desires in common, and to construct their particular joint scenes. Couples can achieve levels of companionship and mutual admiration that lead them to love each other intensely and truly. Love, not passion. Friendly affection, careful, dedicated, the will to support the other and be the basis for the other achievements. The Danish painters Einar and Gerda Wegener, who lived in Europe in the early twentieth century, have achieved this love. They became extremely accomplices. He wanted to reach a point never attempted by humans and that emerged as a possibility in his day, she took his desire to the point of being not only her own but an artistic attempt of both.
In ""The Danish Girl"" we are presented to a passionate, friend couple, who makes their shared life in a succession of moments of pleasure, experimentation, romance, joy, ardent passion, mutual professional and artistic support. Both painters, Einar already relatively successful as an artist, while Gerda seeks to achieve recognition similar to that of her husband. They met very young, when students of the ""Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts"" in Copenhagen, Denmark. They married in 1904, he 22 and she 19 years old. Made for each other, a man who by that time had already idealized being a woman and who was becoming madly horny in this desire and a lesbian.
With a memorable interpretation of Eddie Redmayne (Einar) and also magnificent acting by Alicia Vikander (Gerda), the film drives the spectators to feel all the pain suffered by both in the process of decision of the painter trying to get the sensation of being a woman; and go through surgeries to amputate his genitalia and artificially construct a feminine sexual organ mimesis. It was something like the couple had come together to give life to a work of art. A few years before Einar and Gerda tried to create Lili, Oscar Wilde wisely stated: ""Life imitates art much more than art imitates life"".
As exciting and extremely rewarding as the acting of the main actors is the photography of the film. Director of photography Danny Cohen has done something phenomenal, something really rare and that strikes us, the scenes seem to be built of pictures, paintings that succeed each other. They truly fill our eyes and challenge us to find one among them that does not resemble a beautiful picture and convey the emotions contained within. Nothing more appropriate for a narrative about part of the life of the painters. Cohen also performed in the same role in other feature films, highlighting ""The King's Speech"" and ""Les MisÃ©rables"", but it was with ""The Danish Girl"" that he reached the level of splendor.
Tom Hooper did an exceptional job, also directed the two famous films mentioned above, but it is with the story of Einar and Gerda that he manages to make us deeply identify with the sadness and the disturbance of the Wegener couple. Since watching ""The Danish Girl,"" I wonder how Hooper would film the story of a person with Bodily Identity Identity Disorder."
" The girl
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,3,"I have to be honest, I do not know much about the identity struggle such the one ""Einar Wegener"" suffered from.. but I can get glimpse of what that struggle would be through this movie. I can imagine it was a hard time for such identity crisis to rise up .. but even though the movie showed that there were open minded people that can accept differences around the year 1900 even if these people were few . (----------------This review has spoiler start here--------------)At the beginning of this movie ""Gerda Wegener"" (wife of ""Einar Wegener"") who was shown to be more bold than her husband, asked her husband to pose for a portrait as a woman and at that moment ""Einar"" began to discover what is going on with ""him"".. the movie just present that self discovery and self awareness at the time where there were no one known before ""him"" struggle the same. It is a story of ""Einar"" getting bolder to be ""Lili"" in a hard period of time.. There were few wondering questions during and after the movie finishes.. probably they came up because I do not fully understand the transformation (was it physically, mentally, and emotionally at once!?). It is a lovely movie to watch with parts of the true story of ""Lili Elbe"" who was bold enough to accept performing the first gender-change operation to be fully ""her""."
" Find the Courage to Find Yourself.
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,5,"Directed by Tom Hooper, ""The Danish Girl"" is based on the 2000 novel with the same name written by David Ebershoff. The story is loosely based on the life of Einar Wegener, the first person to go through transgender surgery, and his personal struggles and relationship with his wife. In ""The Danish Girl,"" performances are as important as the story itself. From the first scene I fell in love with Eddie Redmayne's acting and later paid more attention to Alicia Vikander, as Gerda Wegener, and her outstanding performance. Einar is going through a transformation progress to become Lili, and the perception of Gerda's infinite and everlasting love for her husband is the strongest point of the film. This performance brought Alicia Vikander an Academy Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role. On the other hand, Eddie Redmayne's performance was critical for the film's reputation. He is becoming the master in disguise after his equally hard role as Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything. That performance brought him an Oscar for The Best Performance by Actor in a Leading Role. One year later he came very close to win his 2nd Oscar for his performance in ""The Danish Girl."" The role of Einar Wegener/Lili Elbe is very hard to perform. Figures, gestures, mimics and feelings are very important. To master this particular role, you need to feel like Einar Wegener, and Redmayne's performance overcomes all the struggles of this role. With this kind of hard roles, you get to see the real talent of the artist.Controversial or sensitive subjects have always been rewarded in cinema. It is thought by the authorities that this kind of films always serve to the true purpose of art. I don't share this thought, but yet again I am not the one in power to decide what is good and bad for the audience. Films like ""The Danish Girl"" have a mission to show us the unspoken or hidden facts. Most of the time getting into these roles is not easy, and this is the reason why they are usually awarded.Camera shots behind the ballet clothes and paintings manage to make a difference in the means of Cinematography. Beautiful sceneries and identical Danish houses were shot with wide angles, and this technique shows us the importance of cinematography for a film. In ""The Danish Girl,"" both Einar and his wife Gerda are painters. So, default setup of the scenes, with paintings and costumes all over, are preparing you for the grey mood presented throughout the film. Beautiful and diverse costumes also serve the purpose of the film. This brought another nomination to ""The Danish Girl"" for Best Achievement in Costume Design. The clothes Einar wear in disguise as a woman are matching both the era and the inner taste of Lili. Those costumes are somehow the visual representatives of her inner feelings as a woman.The perception of homosexuality back in 20s in Europe is another subject of the film. Tom Hooper focuses on all the struggles of Einar by showing some scenes that take courage to show. He goes to striptease shows and imitates the dancing woman. He goes to fish market to observe the gestures of women. He continuously imagines himself as a woman and getting beaten up once.Lili and Einar are two different characters. One of them is Einar's true form, and the other is the person he is forced to be. Social pressure tends to force you into personalities that don't represent you. If a person doesn't have strong state of mind, this forcing may end up in suicide. This is not the case for Einar. He is a strong character, and he knows that he is a woman inside. This is how he faces all the bumps on the road. Transgender surgeries are a matter of debate even today. In long term, this kind of films are going to build up the social acceptance. This is how cinema serves to society.With outstanding performances and an interesting subject, ""The Danish Girl"" encourages people with the similar situation to act and live their lives as they see fit. Being drama, history and biography, ""The Danish Girl"" is one of the good examples of these genres."
" Weird display of transsexuality
",2018-05-17 00:00:00,7,"""The Danish Girl"" tells the story of the first woman ever to experience the change into her body through operational measures. It shows how a Danish painter and husband recalls long-hidden feelings and finds the strength to stand up for his wish to get a female body, including all that means for his relationship and his beloved ones.First of all it is great that this movie evoked awareness for the feelings of transsexuals and I think that the given biography is more than worth being displayed on the screen. However, I didn't really get warm with this film and this is mainly because I find the display of Lily's transsexuality rather odd. The way it is displayed is really a bit schizophrenic, which transsexuality is clearly not. But I can't imagine any transsexual completely neglecting events or losing certain capabilities like the capability to draw just because they currently switched their gender, which is by the way also not how this works, because transsexuality doesn't transfer you into another person, it just adjusts your body to the person you are. This way, I found it rather hard to follow the film because it seems to be based on a difficult understanding of how transsexuality works, even though the actors delivergreat performances and the overall production value of the film is worthy without question. All in all I would have wished for less Hollywood scripted emotions and more real ones, a more sinister approach to how transsexuals, to make this film as great as its intentions."
" Melodramatic and Animated
",2018-04-10 00:00:00,5,"This film and it's actors just did not capture this real story to the best of their ability. Don't get me wrong as they are both talented A stars but this character Lily was portrayed to be so overly feminine and superficial in her hyper focus on dressing in female clothing. Lily's relationship encounters with men were equally lacking in authenticity. Yes she was a woman trapped inside a man's body but are we still simplify the trans gender or those who identify as such to be only in it for the lipstick and the clothes? Lots of flaws on the approach to this true story moving at a turtle pace when within all that mundane waste of the viewer's time could have been filled with so much more about Lily we'll never know about. Implicitly though I must say that the relationship with her soulmate Gerta shows a perspective of true love and the crosses one bears for those we love with a very unique lense that is remarkably enlightening, inspiring and crucial for all to witness."
" Redmaine shines once again.
",2018-03-03 00:00:00,8,"I wasn't sure this would be a film I'd engage with, but having watched it, I must admit I thoroughly enjoyed it. I know it's received criticism for being historically inaccurate, I would remind those naysayers that it is a film, not a piece of real life. It is a dazzling looking film, it looks absolutely sensational, the visuals are beautiful, if ever an Oscar should have been won for design, costumes etc, this is it. Alicia Vikander is of course phenomenal, and worthy of her Oscar, but I have to say Eddie Redmayne is the catalyst that made the film for me, as he so often does, a truly outstanding actor, who's career rightly so is taking off. It's quite a sombre film, not one I'd particularly revisit anytime soon, but I'm certainly glad I've seen it, and I certainly would recommend it."
" Second time unlucky for Redmayne
",2018-01-27 00:00:00,2,"THE DANISH GIRL is a surprisingly unworkable historical drama from the director behind THE KING'S SPEECH. It's about a Danish couple whose loves were thrown into turmoil by the husband's decision to transition into a woman in an era when such a thing was unheard of. Based on a true story, this is notable for featuring big name actor Eddie Redmayne trying to recapture some of the glory he gained in playing Stephen Hawking in THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING, but it's second time unlucky for the actor. Where his performance as Hawking convinced, here he seems extremely superficial, merely fluttering his eyelashes a lot in his attempt to convince as a woman born in a man's body. The whole thing is slow and dragged out to a turgid pace, and all of the cast feel icy cold and unsympathetic. Alicia Vikander is miscast as the wife and looks and acts like a petulant child for a lot of the running time. It's an unremarkable film I really struggled to finish."
" Interesting watch
",2018-01-26 00:00:00,5,"I enjoyed the film, it was interesting, but I did find Eddie Redmayne really annoying, kept doing this wide eyed look anout, or wide eyes look away that just made him look a bit crazy eyed! The female lead was awesome. Well worth a watch."
" Brave beauty
",2018-01-24 00:00:00,8,"Finally got round to seeing 'The Danish Girl' last night, having been intrigued by it (thanks to its subject, the way it was advertised and the talent involved) for a long time but not having the time due to heavy music and music college work commitments and being behind with my ""must-see"" list. My thoughts were that it is a beautiful and courageous film that won't be, and clearly isn't judging from the polarising user review opinions here, everybody's cup of tea, but is a sensitive and emotionally powerful portrayal of a subject matter that's important, very much relevant (even more so now) and controversial. It takes a lot of guts to portray this subject in any form and 'The Danish Girl' acquits itself beautifully if not perfectly. 'The Danish Girl' to me is not without its imperfections. It does drag a little at times and trimming 10-15 minutes off the running time would have helped it perhaps. The script, while mostly thought-provoking and sensitive, has instances where it's too lightweight and needed a tightening up and could have been bolder and take more risks. So much works though. 'The Danish Girl' looks gorgeous, like an art painting come to life, especially the landscapes and sumptuous period detail. The costumes are evocative and pleasing on the eyes and the whole film is beautifully photographed. Alexandre Desplat's score is one of his most hypnotic and enchanting and Tom Hooper's direction is perhaps him at his most subtle and understated. It, in terms of writing and story, is mostly thought-provoking and treats the subject matter with an honesty, sensitivity and a big emotional wallop. There are instances such as the ending where the film did bring tears to my eyes. Can't say anything bad about the performances. Eddie Redmayne is the top-billed star and he does give a very deeply felt and courageous turn. Oddly enough though Gerda is actually the focus, where her complex feelings are ones that anybody in her position would relate to. Alicia Vikander's performance is truly sensational and her chemistry with Redmayne is also one where it is clear they're in love with each other. All the supporting cast are strong, my favourite being the sympathetic one of Matthias Schoenaerts.All in all, beautiful and brave film but not for all. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
" True Essence of Love
",2018-01-16 00:00:00,9,"If you don't know the plot and even don't intend to then this review is for you. This movie shows how beautifully the love can be represented. I just want to say the one word for this movie and that is ""AWESOME"". I watched this movie at 3 am and my eyes were crying to sleep but this movie just trapped me in its emotions which was the result of the flawless representation and natural acting of the superb actors.
Portrayal of real characters is as it must be(advice for the people who said that Eddie Redmayne did not do true judgement with the character) and what to say about Alicia Vikandar, I was internally in love with her while watching the movie. Her expressions and dialogue-delivery just revive the real Gerda Wegenar.
Shooting locations are so impressive. It is a beautiful movie. It also contain some nude scenes but there is no sex. Those scenes are the demand of the depiction of the story. Some scene indirectly represents the feelings of Einar Wegener(Lead Male/Female(You will understand after watching the movie) character).Let us see you can feel them or not(I am hinting ""Creation of a painting so many times"").
If you are really interested in watching a master-piece emotional drama and did not have any hatred for non-straight persons then this movie is specially created to invest your precious time in it."
" Inaccurate and unnecessarily sad
",2017-11-29 00:00:00,1,"Having already known the story of Gerda Wegener and Lili Elbe, I went into this movie expecting an uplifting story about Gerda and her wife, who she loved, Lili. I expected some dramatic moments, some tragedies, but perhaps they would even end on a high note, as Lili's surgeries were successful up until her attempted uterine transplant, something that still has not been successfully completed in a transgender woman. Instead, I got a movie where Lili is never allowed to really live her life. I got a movie with two ham-fisted heterosexual romance plots. I got a movie that, in the end, seems to punish it's transgender lead for the crime of being herself. This movie shows Gerda as being anywhere from skeptical to downright negative towards Lili's transition, when accounts say that Gerda was very supportive of Lili, and remained attracted to her after she began living as a woman. Lili was even portrayed as ""being Lili"" whenever she showed attraction to a man, but ""being Einar"" when attracted to Gerda. What?? Presenting as a woman does not suddenly mean Lili has to be straight. I could rant about this movie for pages. In the end, I was greatly disappointed. For a movie that could have been so great, it ended up being just another movie where the LGBT characters end up either straight, dead, or both."
" A Mans femininity
",2017-08-18 00:00:00,8,This movie is a must watch for all those men who have girly nature and some girl inside them. Story is very true and lot of things can be learned .Must watch to know more about Gender feeling. It's based on painter couple. Wife of painter and actress of movie has done a great job . Her acting is world class.
" A tighter editing and a different male lead could have helped
",2017-08-12 00:00:00,6,"Loosely based on a ""real"" story, the plot is about Einar Wegener/Lili, one of the first transgender people to undergo surgery. The story starts in 1926, with Einar happily married to Gerda. Both are painters, enjoying some fame in Copenhagen. One day Gerda asks Einer to wear silk stockings to pose for an unfinished portrait of a ballerina and from then on Einar starts discovering Lili, his ""female"" side, which will end up ""killing"" Einar.Gerda pursues her career and finds success with Einar's portraits as his female counterpart Lili. The couple moves to Paris, where Einar can leave more openly as Lili in the bohemian artist society. Also, Gerda meets a former friend of Einar, the brooding and all-male Hans, who stirs feelings presumably more pleasant than dealing with your husband's trans-sexuality.After several disastrous meetings with different doctors, all of whom think Einar is insane, a German surgeon finally announces he will try to help Einar getting rid of his male parts and start living fully as Lili. Gerda, supported by Hans, decides to stick to Lili's decision and stays with her ""husband"" during his medical treatment. However, surgery is a risky business, even more so a hundred years agoÂ…. The movie created - predictably - some controversy. Some criticized the fictional character of Hans, but I think he provided a much needed masculine but discreet performance, to balance the Einar/Lili character. Vikander is really good in showing the strong mix of emotions Gerda felt during Einar's journey: from amusement to worry, from horror, desperation and rage and finally to support. I did not like much Redmayne as Einar/Lili. Granted it was a difficult part to play, but Redmayne drove me to distraction with his hands movements and his fluttering of eyelashes. Besides, he was not even remotely believable as a woman, just a guy in wig and drags. I am surprised he did not ""attract"" more bewildered reactions, especially during the first outing at the big ball in Copenhagen. That anybody there mistook him for a girl is ludicrous.Photography and costumes are very good, especially the choice of the cold, Nordic light and minimalist interiors. However, after the move to Paris, the story does slow down considerably and even more so after the first surgery, when I thought the movie should finish, but there was still a bit to go. A tighter editing and a different male lead would have helped."
" Emotional Story
",2017-07-07 00:00:00,8,The acting and the story was really good and interesting. After watching the movie you can feel how much a transgender could suffer in the past when people didn't have information about it. You could even feel hurting with the character. The movie really made me emotional and I recommend it to those you haven't seen it.
" ""There was a moment when I was just Lili...""
",2017-05-03 00:00:00,8,"For a film dealing with subject matter completely out of my comfort zone, I thought director Hooper sensitively handled a complex topic intelligently in the manner of Ang Lee's ""Brokeback Moountain"" of 2005. The movie itself is beautifully filmed, and Eddie Redmayne's performance as the transgendered Einar/Lili comes close to his Oscar winning portrayal of Stephen Hawking in the prior year's ""The Theory Of Everything"". Alicia Vikander is also competent in the role of Einar's wife Gerda, resolutely standing by her spouse's decision to follow through on a sex change operation after initial misgivings about Einar's apparently sudden mental and physical transformation. Taking place in the late 1920's in Europe, I wasn't surprised at the reaction of the medical profession to what was going on with Einar, though I wouldn't have thought that experimental forms of gender reassignment surgery took place as early as 1930. To think that if Einar had been in the wrong place at the wrong time, he might have wound up in an institution for moral depravity undergoing treatment for perversion. In that regard, the film chronicles a valiant pioneering effort on the part of Einar/Lili for those individuals hopelessly conflicted over their own sexual identity."
" Beautifully acted story of first transgender female
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,8,"Tom Hooper's The Danish Girl tells the story of one of the first transgender females, at least one of the first, if not THE first one to undergo the sex change surgery. Set in 1926, the sets are very well designed and accurate to the time period. The makeup used in the film is fantastic, very beautiful classic style of makeup, the makeup has to be good for a film of this kind, it just has to be. The sequence where Einer is putting on his makeup for the first time is breathtaking visually and very well done. I loved the costume design for each individual character, especially lili. The costumes that lili wore suited her so very well and she looked absolutely beautiful in all of them. And Alicia Vikander looks great in both her makeup and tee various costumes. Now we get to the best part of the entire film, and that is the performances by the actors. We'll start with the academy award winning performance given by Alicia Vikander. Vikander gives a truly moving, deep performance that is rooted in love and rife with strong emotion throughout. Her character goes through a lot as you can imagine. Eddie Redmayne is such a marvelous actor! He plays both Einer and lili sooo well. The way in which he behaves, talks and behaves as lili is so skilled and natural, you never feel like you're watching Eddie act, it feels real. There are a couple of scenes I would like to recognize because they were so needed and crucial to this film. One scene is where Einer is nude in front of a mirror and he tucks his penis in between his legs and it looks like he now has a vulva, this is a crucial scene that HAD to be included, it showcase his character's journey to self discovery. Another is Einer visiting a peep show to see a nude woman and see how she moves and examine/mimic her mannerisms, another scene showcasing self discovery. I feel the ending was handled fairly well, no complaints about that. Moving, well acted, visually great looking and important story. 8/10"
" Good but....
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,7,"I just want to add one thing to these reviews. I would like to say that the acting performances are very good, or, in the case of Alicia Vikander, excellent, but sadly they are let down by the current fashion that all dialogue has to be whispered or mumbled whether that is relevant or not."
" Great Danes
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,6,"Inspired by a 1920s Danish artist with gender dysphoria who became one of the first to ever opt for surgical gender realignment, this Tom Hooper drama offers an intriguing insight into a fairly recent time when such terms were unheard of. The central character's dilemma is, as a result, twice as interesting as he not only has to wrestle with his own identity but a lack of support and understanding. Promising as this might sound, and relatively convincing as lead actor Eddie Redmayne is in drag, his character is always self-absorbed with a near total disregard for his wife's feelings that renders him hard to relate to. Alicia Vikander fares better as the neglected wife in the equation with a more dynamic character arc as she gradually learns to accept that she needs to ""lose"" her husband for him to be happy; looks convey more than words in a memorable moment as she is told ""he won't be your husband"" after surgery. In fact, a more enticing film could have been spun from concentrating more on her. Something also feels amiss in how Vikander dressing Remayne as a woman (for a pose) is the event that triggers everything. We are later given a couple of anecdotes about him having similar feelings in the past, but it mostly feels that dressing up started it all - not deep-rooted inner doubts. Of course, there is a limit to how much can be fitted into a two hour feature, and with sterling cinematography and great music, plus accurate costumes and sets, 'The Danish Girl' does a decent job, even if it sometimes feels like it is only skimming the surface here."
" Exquisite, sensitive, intimate
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,10,"If this film doesn't strike a chord with you, I'm sorry, but you must have been watching at the wrong time of the day/night or with the wrong company.If you're truly open and attentive to the delicate detail of its art design, lighting, wardrobe, script and most of all... it's superb acting/direction, you'll laugh and cry and feel just as if you were there, going through everything this true loving couple go through.Those of you complaining about the film being accurate or not, come on this is not a documentary but fiction ""based on a real story"". Why expect more than that. The film does plenty as it is. It does its job as film and makes a very needed social statement too about true freedom and love.Extraordinary film. Not to be missed."
" The Danish Girl
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,4,"The Danish Girl"" is yet another politically correct movie by Tom Hooper. No doubt that the topic â€“ the story of the first transgender patient was chosen by him not by accident.To criticize the film is a hard task when critics can be interpreted as intolerant and so on. However the director was not able to reflect the complexity and dramatism of the real story of Lili Elbe, born as Einar Wegener who died as a result of an unsuccessful sex reassignment operation.The film is too superficial, too shallow and it seems that the director does not know what the story is about. The film Glen or Glenda by Ed Wood was more convincing. The depiction of Gerda Wegener â€“ the wife of Lili is not believable either.In the end of the film we see the text praising Lili Elbe as an inspiration to the transgenders to come. This politically correct remark leaves a sort of bewilderment. The unhealthy fixation with own sexuality is not really the most important thing in this complex world full of much more significant problems. This text is a classical example of imposing a questionable and politically motivated point of view to the audience instead of leaving space for thought. Perhaps the story of Lili can not only be an inspiration but also a warning for those people who want to solve their psychological problems with a surgeons knife.The film is shot in a pleasant color scheme which makes it possible to watch the film, albeit not without severe boredom.See more reviews at: http://indie-cinema.com/"
" Woman Trapped in a Man's Body
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,6,"In 1926, in Copenhagen, the successful landscape painter Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne) is happily married with the portrait painter Gerda (Alicia Vikander) and they have been trying to have a baby for six years. When the model Ulla (Amber Heard) does not come to their apartment, Gerda asks Einar to pose as a woman for her to proceed her work and Einar uses the alias Lili Elbe. There is a party and Gerda convinces Einar to pose of Lili to play a prank in the guests. However, Einar leaves his identity behind and unleashes the personality of Lili. He lives in a constant dilemma until the day he meets Dr. Kurt Warnekros (Sebastian Koch) that offers a dangerous surgery to change his sex. What will Einar do?""The Danish Girl"" is a film with the story of a woman trapped in a man 's body and one of the first surgeries to change the sex. The theme may be attractive for a few people, but the cinematography is magnificent and the performances are top-notch. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""A Garota Dinamarquesa"" (""The Danish Girl"")"
" Suffers from an Unengaging Plot and Characters,
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,5,"The Danish Girl is a very mediocre movie with an overall poorly developed plot and an excellent cast that do their best to try and save it. There is no questioning the beauty of the scenery itself, the cinematography is outstanding. Tom Hooper clearly put a lot of work in to establishing the world these characters are living in. Alicia Vikander and Eddie Redmayne also shine in their roles, beautifully portraying the emotions these characters are experiencing in these rough times. While the performances are stellar, the characters themselves are unlikeable. I had no sympathy for Einar, a man who completely disregarded his wife's feelings because he wanted to become a woman. He comes across as arrogant and selfish from the beginning, which makes it hard for us to support him in his journey. It is also tries far too hard to be heartwarming. The objective of almost every scene is to make the audience cry, delivering a wide range of emotions that is in no way subtle and leaves us feeling underwhelmed by what they are showcasing as a result of trying too much. It informed me of the importance of character development in a script,, no matter how good the performances, if the characters are not well established in the screenplay, we will gain no remorse for them. With a very slow pace and unengaging plot, The Danish Girl is worth giving a miss. A wife is thrown apart when her husband gains a passion for pretending to be a woman. Best Performance: Alicia Vikander"
