" There is no there there
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,1,I have seen movies with no point. I have seen movies that make no sense. The majority of the time when this happens I will usually say that I just didn't get it. This is the first time I can ever truly say that I feel there was no point for me to get here. It was soulless. It was so lifeless that it did not have enough energy to be pretentious. There was also this very depressing and intrusive music throughout. I do not in any way see the relationship between this movie and love the way other reviewers have. The second half of the movie looks like it will evolve into something meaningful but it's just as void of meaning and life as the rest of the movie. It was a colossal waste of time for me.
" Lucky lobster
",2021-03-25 00:00:00,7,"In a dystopian future, single people are sent to The Hotel, where they have 45 days to find a soul mate, or they will be transformed into animals. It's a dark comedy about relationships, social pressure, loneliness and self-love. Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos (The Favorite), The Lobster is a bizarre and peculiar film, wrapped in a melancholic and dense atmosphere, yet attractive, and almost hypnotic. Among people who are destined to be together, others who prefer to live a lie, to be socially accepted, or those who are ostracized for feeling comfortable alone, there is a well-told story, although the pace could be different, allowing the characters to have another dynamic. The film fails by not scrutinizing the transformation (into animals), leaving an emptiness that could have connected some loose ends of the story, for more coherence. The photography works well with the narrative, with a palette of cool colors and a saturation that matches the mood."
" Another garbage
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,1,I lost my time watching this one totally don't waste yours trust me on this one..
" Got boring
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,3,"Started out interesting, but then got boring very quickly after the main character escaped."
" Was glad to see...
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,1,"I'm not the only one who thought there was no point to this film. Sure, there are a bunch of high-brow reviews that ""critically acclaim"" the success, but the film feels like it was something Colin and Rachel were contractually obligated to make. I'm sad for them."
" I'm so over the Lanthimos weirdness
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,2,"The title says it. ""Weird"" for the sake of it, with no real pace, essence, or depth.
The film started off with an interesting, kind of tired but still potentially engaging, black-mirroresque story that still didn't quite flow (""intentional"", I know, but aren't we bored of intentionally boring artsiness yet?). Olivia Colman was the only good thing about this movie and even she couldn't save it.
I guess Lanthimos stans like this film. I didn't. But then again, I didn't like Dogtooth either."
" You have to be kidding me?
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,1,Without a doubt the word that comes to mind is pretentious..over and over again..almost like it's subliminally projected throughout this pile of artificially stilted piece of drivel. What does a group of pseudo-intellectuals locked in a closet come up with to try to prove to the world that they're clever? This.
" Worst movie I've ever seen.
",2021-03-02 00:00:00,1,This movie is so confusing. I didn't understand anything as I watched this movie. I don't know how it got 7 stars.
" Disappointed.
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,5,"The plot is really unique, which is why I watch the movie with big expectation. And I really, really, want to laugh because it is said the movie is comedy. Turns out it is really depressing for me. I maybe, for once, laughed, but not because it's funny.I don't understand all the good reviews. But well, everyone have their own ""taste"" for every movie. Maybe this is just not a movie of my taste."
" Stopped watching after 30 seconds
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,1,Started with the ruthless killing of an animal for no reason. Nope. I refuse to watch movies from Hollywood with that garbage. After reading reviews I'm glad I didnt waste my life watching it.
" It's not for everyone, but it may be for you.
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,7,"It's not for everyone. It's not quite for me, but I felt I had to put my two cents in about the film after seeing a NYT section today, on Valentine's Day, listing it as a movie discouraging love because I emphatically disagree with that statement.
First off, The Lobster is weird, and it's strangeness may be overwhelming and times in a way that can cloud what the true meaning of it is. It is depressing and quite pessimistic, yes, but this is done more to show the dangers of trying to define love rather than disparaging love itself.
The film's message, in my opinion, is that love can be indefineable; it's more of a feeling; a feeling that is indefinite, uncatagorical, and often times irrational.
The film simply is expressing the dangers of trying to categorize, organize, and rationalize love in an extremely over the top fashion.
Love should not be determined by good matches based on physical and definable traits, as is done in this story's dystopian world. It comes more from the minute details and underlying personalities between two people.
The film is not disparaging to love, but rather to people who don't understand a relationship from the outside looking in and discount it.
However it may seem, the idea that The Lobster hates love is wholly wrong. It is more a sad coutionary tale about trying to rationalize something that is undefinable and the lengths people will go to simply to freely feel in a society that requires proof of something unprovable from the outside. I am in love because I feel I am in love, and nothing more should need to be said."
" I could only watch 56 minutes.
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,1,"I have never known the horror of what it must feel like to wake up in a coffin and realize that you have been buried alive. Trapped, unable to move and realizing you will be experiencing a slow and painful death.
After watching ""THE LOBSTER"" and I believe I have experienced something relatively similar."
" Animal abuse.
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,1,"If you get off on animal abuse, then this movie is for you.There really isn't much else I can say. This movie is awful and pointless."
" Strange, but pleasantly attractive
",2021-02-05 00:00:00,7,"Set against a dystopian backdrop, the Lobster is the telling of a mix of bizarre ideas that one could only come to consider through this movie, and done so with much elegance that it keeps your attention throughout the span of its runtime.The world of The Lobster is eerily wooden, as is the range of expressions the actors were allowed to portray, constructing a universe that gets all the more weirder the more you think of it.The success of this movie is hooking you in with a sledgehammer of an opening act; with a world so strange, you find yourself wanting to know more about its intricacies and workings. Its drawback, however, is its world presented fully (almost exhausted) within the first half, that the remainder of the movie tends to feel draggy.Overall, however, the experiences from this movie are pleasant, and I would recommend it to someone wanting to watch something ""different""."
" Weird yet wonderful
",2021-02-03 00:00:00,10,"This movie is not for everyone. It is definitely one that you have to sought of analyse as the whole movie is essentially a metaphor on societies expectations of love. It highlights how society expects you to be in a relationship or be looking for a relationship and if you are not your life is somehow less meaningful. It makes an exaggerated parallel on how you change yourself to seem more compatible using a defining characteristic to highlight this. However it also highlights how the 'single' community set there own rules which can be just as restrictive like there are pressures to stay single.
It makes you think where is the line between actual love and the societies expectations of love. I honestly love this movie. In some twisted way this movie is a love story. I have watched it multiple times and will continue to rewatch it on occasion. If you are looking for a light, quickly digestible move then this isn't for you, but if you like to be challenged by a movie and want it to have a lasting effect then give it a watch."
" Disturbingly stupid film
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,1,"One of the most disturbing films I've eve seen. Secondly, if anyone has respect for the gift of vision and for people who have lost their vision or vision problems, why on earth could anyone even make a stupid, ridiculous movie like this.
I had to finish it to actually see if there was anything to redeem it, Nothing."
" Acid trip
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,4,I understand what it's like to be on LSD now. Had a good laugh. Good dog sadly died rip
" Lobster is an excellent choice...
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,9,"It's a quirky, weird, absurd, fun film to watch. But this kind of humour is not for everyone. The Lobster made me sad at times, it also depicts the pros & cons of loneliness perfectly. The dialogues are the best part of this black comedy.
Both Colin Farrell & Rachel Weisz did splendid job to portray their characters with subtle nuances. The supporting actors did very well too. Highly recommended."
" Don't Waste Your Time
",2021-01-22 00:00:00,1,"It was weird right from the beginning, but I thought eventually it would get better. It didn't. As a matter of fact, it only got weirder. I turned it off before it was halfway through."
" Great
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,8,"I don't get why there are so many bad reviews here, it doesn't make any sense. I think we can call this movie unusual. In the future we are obliged to be married and we have to find our partner through a specific hotel. We have 45 days to find our match or we will be turn into an animal (at least we can choose which animal). I hope it never happens because it's worse than Tinder and I'd rather just be turned into an animal on day 1.The Lobster is funny with a little bit of drama. I liked it very much."
" Waste of my time
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,2,I kept watching waiting for it to get better and both my wife and myself agreed that this was one off the dumbest movies we ever watched.
" Unreal waste of time
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,2,It was so add that we had to keep watching. And of course it ends terribly so I have no idea what happens.
" Total waste of time
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,1,Wish I had all that time back I wasted watching this pathetic piece of crap film. And to top off that steaming pile of excrement? A COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS AND UNSATISFACTORY ENDING!!!
" Intensely Strange Film
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,6,This is perhaps the weirdest movie I have ever seen. I could not stop watching because it was so strange.
" For those with gold leaf looking for lillies
",2021-01-14 00:00:00,1,"What a remarkable waste of time. Watch with CC selected, phone in hand with one earphone listening to something else worthwhile."
" ""Ti einai afto pou to lene agapi"".
",2021-01-12 00:00:00,10,"Yorgos Lanthimos is definitely the most popular contemporary Greek auteur and his films have all been well-received by the global audiences and critics as well. He began as a video clip and TV commercials director while he created his first feature film, Kinetta, in 2005. Nevertheless, Lanthimos's first major success that put him in the spotlight was Dogtooth, a daring allegory focusing on family relationship dynamics and their effects on the individual. Domestic oppression, free will or the lack of it, and distortion of reality through the misuse of language were the central themes in this compelling movie which has been nominated for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year in the 2011 Oscar Awards. Furthermore, Dogtooth signified the beginning of a thriving collaboration between Lanthimos and screenwriter Efthimis Filippou, a partnership that delivered some of the most intriguing movies of the following decade. The Lobster is a 2015 production in which Lanthimos and Filippou exceed themselves and present a monumental parable about the nature of love set in a dystopian alternative universe where a tyranny of companionship dominates the people and forces them to mate with a fellow human. The inventive storyline is combined with a well-paced plot that moves forward handily and stunning photography that grips the audience from the beginning until the end. The cast is excellent with Colin Farell, who would also participate in Lanthimos's later film, The Killing of a Sacred Deer, in the role of David, a timid man who struggles to survive in an absurd world where the fate of each person is decided by an omnipotent system which possesses supernatural powers. Farell's portrayal of David is measured and consistent, building a character who lacks any heroic dimension, while at the same time retaining the characteristics that define him as a human such as fear, compassion, or even cruelty.Being a single, middle-aged man, David is arrested and sent to an institution where he has to stay for a defined period of time in order to mate with a woman. The punishment for not succeeding at this simple task is his transformation into an animal of his own liking. David's choice is a lobster because they live for over 100 years, he has blue blood, like aristocrats, and is fertile for as long as he lives. He is accompanied by a dog, his brother who couldn't manage to find a partner so he suffered the consequences. The institution's director has set strict rules for all the guests/prisoners who can extend their abidance by hunting the loners, a group of people living in the nearby woods who don't conform to the existing status quo and choose to live by their own rules. David will soon get acquainted with several people who share his predicament and he will attempt to approach a woman who seemingly has no feelings about anyone or anything. The result of this relationship will be dreadful and the protagonist will have no other solution but to escape the institution and live as a loner.In Lanthimos's fictional universe, humans are defined by their deficiencies. There is the woman with the nosebleeds, the man with a limp foot, the heartless woman, the blind woman, and so on. These imperfections are central to the construction of the peoples' identity and determine their choice of a possible partner. Shared life means shared pain. Thus, several people try to imitate the defects of the others during their stay in the institution, even if it is a lie. It is the only way to attract the attention of their prospective mates and they also know that the alternative is their conversion into an animal with all that it entails. It is a desperate situation, one that forces people to behave in ways that they couldn't imagine. When David joins the loners he quickly comprehends that the suffocating rules that made him escape from the institution are also present there. He is not allowed to have sex with another person, only to masturbate alone, and every form of companionship is prohibited in this new environment. His romantic entanglement with the short-sighted woman, played by Rachel Weisz, is now interpreted as a rebellious act of defiance against the new rules rather than a submission to the dominant norm.The cinematography is sublime and fits the story perfectly. In the first part, we are witnessing the everyday life in the institution, a place that looks like a luxury hotel while in the second one, we are transferred to the much more primitive landscape where the loners live. This contrast of scenery adds up to an overall polarized feeling that is exuded from the story due to its bizarre foundation. In a way, the second part of The Lobster constitutes an inversion of the first one, an opposite image that enhances and magnifies the importance of the love story that lies in the center of the film. The use of music furnishes the story even further and I was particularly moved by the presence of two greek songs, ""Apo mesa pethamenos"" performed by Danae Stratigopoulou and, of course, ""Ti einai afto pou to lene agapi"" by Tonis Maroudas and Sophia Loren. As a Greek, I am proud that a director of this caliber is a compatriot of mine and I feel the same about the screenwriter, Efthimis Filippou, who wrote a story of unprecedented beauty and craftsmanship. Lanthimos has established his name as the greatest living Greek auteur and his movies are always something different, transcendent visual experiences that are bound to make the audiences think and feel intensely"

" Extremely Weird and Inventive Film
",2021-01-07 00:00:00,8,"This is a film that you may leave wondering what in the hell you just watched and how you possibly conceive the concepts presented on to the silver screen. However that is why this film ignites such a spark of brilliance. It leans into the absurdity and builds on concepts presented in the beginning. The main concept being the internal we feel society has bestowed on us to take what is perceived as the righteous path. In this film it uses the concept of marriage to depict this dilemma that we all usually encounter. Sometimes we are fighting against our hopes and true inner desires in order to fit in with the crowd. This film shows the consequences of opposing these social expectations in the most literal, dystopian, and extreme way possible. Which is why this film is great, it takes a concept that has extreme relevance to nearly all people and bends it into a great film is abstract and seemingly unrealistic but still in some ways, entirely possible. Sort of like a film like Being John Malkovich, it deals with wildly creative and imaginative occurrences but underlines an extremely relatable and resonating underlying message and symbolism. Is is an Indie Art House type of film that is not bound by restriction of trying to be absolute or subjective. The idiosyncratic nature is what makes this great and may also be why it makes it hard to watch for some but it is certainly one of the most creative films I have watched and that should be a laudable feat."
" Quietly Absurd and Funny
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,9,"Jokes that catch you a few seconds later- jokes played super dry. the premise is great, never could catch on to where the plot was going. i wouldn't call it slow, but it's definitely not a fast movie- it's got a steady beat, not boring. shame that prime doesn't translate the french bits."
" Surprising....
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,8,"I rarely write reviews, but I felt I must for this one. I did not expect this to affect me the way it did. I found a lot of meaning in the film. It parallels humanity and society, showing the cruel and difficult ways people suffer in life. Through given choices, at times are plagued with unthinkable results. Other times are beautiful and shaded with challenges to succeed and be happy. The humor is there, at times dark. I found this movie brilliant. There are moments without dialogue that speak profoundly. Not a film for everyone, but a powerful movie, nonetheless."
" one of the dumbest movies ever
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,3,I gave this a 3 because I actually watched the whole thing. Could be the dumbest movie and waste of time that I could have spent watching something worthwhile. Yuk!
" If you've ever owned a dog don't watch
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,1,"Good performances, but ultimately this movie is an exploration in perversion just for perversion sake. The commentary on love is only half-baked and seems to be more about being offensive than truly making a statement. There is a very graphic shot that shows a dead and bloody border collie, as someone who has had to watch their beloved border collie die and to deal with end of life images in their head; this is not one I did not need to be brought up again. The scene is unnecessary as the dog is described as dead in the previous scene, no need to show the actual bloodied body. If this director has ever lost a loved one, he has some issues. As anyone who has seen a loved one lose their soul in front of them knows, these images live in your head forever and do not need to be recreated. The ""comedy"" is lost on me, and ultimately is trivial. Deadpan is a style, but graphic images of dead animals borders on the mentally deranged. I would say this man is attempting to deal with his trauma through the screen, and should be more concerned with triggering viewers with PTSD. The movie gives no aid in dealing with the trauma it could make viewers relive, and is irresponsible. The man should get counseling not project his issues on the viewer. The high reviews only speak to how desensitized our society is with true loss."
" Interestingly weird
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,7,"The lobster is a strange beast of a film, it holds itself as one of those experiences you only need to go through once and it leaves you thinking for a very long time. The world it takes place in is very absurd and feels like its trying to reflect an intense version of what society is built on.The characters in the movie are very out there, it feels like they have their thoughts and feelings on their sleeve, and there is little to nothing to be interpreted about them. (That being said its not a bad thing, the movie almost needs this in order to work) The main character makes his choices on a 100% logical basis, instead of any of his choices being based on emotion, for example, his choice of a lobster stems from him wanting to live long and be blue blooded like aristocrats, instead of wanting to be something like a dog for emotional attachment.The rules of this world, (People turning into animals) doesn't feel very pushed, the world they live in still feels realistic, it feels like the characters dont treat it as a different reality, but rather as what they accept reality to be, and this makes sense.The acting is mostly excellent, my only problem with it is the acting whenever a character acts like they are acting, to be fair, this is a very difficult thing to pull off in cinema, as the audience needs to be aware that the character is indeed acting, but it needs to fit in just well enough to seem believable to the other characters. The actors do the cliché ""Act natural"" voice.The film felt itself to be very long, and I felt myself losing interest about 3/4s of the way through, but the end of the movie ended up gaining my attention back."

" Interesting concept but feels like it could have been even better
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,8,"Good movie overall, very interesting to watch and quite funny at times. The second half of the movie loses a bit in rhythm. The director has a compelling story to tell with very interesting points (views on relationships in our society) however, it somehow feels that the movie doesn't fully convey the message it wants to convey. Feels like there is something missing in the movie."
" Not sure what people see in this
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,1,"A lot of 8+ stars & 87% on Rotten Tomatoes? I don't get it. The two leads act like it's a casting call and they're just reading the script. And I like Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz. Slow, dull, occasional dark, bizarre humor, but I'm not going to make it till the end."
" Waste of Time

" apropos
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,8,"The ten commandments prohibit even talking about doubt. Zealots used to wear masks because the book told them to. now we wear masks because scientists tell us to. for all known civilization, the truth has been illegal. on tv, the news, and private conversations; the truth is dangerous and to be avoided at all painful costs.
People sacrifice freedom for security. so much so that after all these millennia, the people have no idea what freedom is anymore. its the blind leading the blind. the points that this movie makes, are as obvious as simple sarcasm. the movie tries to illustrate the fatality of the one world order, not because a dictator or a cabal forces the regime, but because the people want it. they fight for it. how sad.
The best you can hope for is love. but this movie really doesn't offer that hope. the movie offers no hope really. but it is an opportunity to discuss the truth, and what you will do to win your freedom.
it is fitting for this time of mandatory social interactions. it may already be too late. can awareness save us. if not, what else.

" Quirky? No, ridiculous

" How to find your soul mate
",2020-12-09 00:00:00,5,"The theme of finding one's mate takes on the most bizarre and grotesque outlines in this film - sometimes comic, and sometimes on the verge of black humor. Funny situations are encountered based on a combination of something extremely sanctimonious and extremely sexually liberated - for example, that scene when a couple in love unexpectedly starts kissing more and more passionately during the visit to the parents of the ""ringleader"" girl and music performance. Or when at first they explain to the hotel guests with the help of funny sketches why a girl needs a man. in my opinion.
Sometimes they overdo, for example, in a situation with removing the eyes."

It was painful to watch. I would like to know, based on these numerous thrilled comments from years ago when this movie was released, and when I watched it, if anyone have returned to watch this movie even once more. I don't think anyone ever did. Sensationalism will kill the art."

",2020-11-11 00:00:00,6,"Going into this movie, I knew exactly what to expect given it was a Yorgos Lanthimos film. The first 40 mins of the movie for me was a great piece that showed viewers a dystopian world where their societal norms are out of hand compared to our own bias. It really gave me a keen perspective into the What-if and what things could really turn into.In this film the movie mostly revolves around a hotel that gives someone 45 days to find a partner, and only a true partner, where the couple is closely monitored by the hotel. If someone is found out to be a liar they are turned into an animal that no one wants to be.About halfway through the movie he escapes the hotel and tries to live among ""The Loners"" which are people that are single and don't follow the societal norm of having a partner even going as far to not even allow romantic or sexual relationships. This is where the movie loses me.At this point, it turned into an illogical and chaotic plothole that I was hoping to end soon. The immersion of the world they lived in seemed to dissipate and turned into a weird revenge plot where I didn't care which way it was going to end. Given how Yorgos Lanthimos movies are, I think the guy is a deep writer/director that comes up with great concepts to show the extremes of human psyche and society but then forgets he is making a movie and wraps it up as soon as possible."

" A Perfect Film in Every Way, But... I Didn't Like It
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,7,"The Lobster is directed and co-written by Yorgos Lanthimos (LAN-TH-E-MOS(T)), and stars Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, LÃ©a Seydoux and John C. Reilly. The film takes place in a dystopian future and follows a recently widowed man, David, being sent away to The Hotel, where he must find a romantic partner in forty-five days, or he, alongside the other residents, will be turned into an animal and sent out into the wild. Originally premiering at festivals back in 2015, The Lobster, didn't get a mainstream limited release until 2016, and wow what an interesting piece of art this film is.The Lobster, is a very peculiar film, that has a lot to say about the themes of love, and how it is represented in our society today. The film uses its representation of love and societal expectations through the use of The Hotel, wherein the residents there have a set amount of time to find a love interest or they'll be disowned and turned into an animal of their choosing. Those who choose to escape The Hotel, can live amongst the outsiders in the woods, where they must abide by a different ruleset, and not be intimate with any persons of that group, all while being hunted by The Hotel residents. These black and white themes of love presented in The Lobster, are ever-present in our society today; with beliefs of settling down with a partner before the age of 40, as to not appear as a black sheep, and individuals who choose to be single also adhere to similar types of societal expectations.
The Lobster, excels at presenting these larger themes, alongside smaller allegories, such as the notion of 'love is blind'. This is an expertly crafted film, that plays out like an evil Wes Anderson movie due to its absurdist dark humour and delivery of the dialogue, which I may add is also perfect. There was not one bad performance in The Lobster, from the menacing, Heartless Woman played by Angeliki Papoulia, to the loveable Lisping Man portrayed by John C. Reilly or even the intimidating Loner Leader, which LÃ©a Seydoux depicts excellently. However, the heart of the film solely rests on Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz, who are imperfect as much as they are charismatic. Their characters represent the grey, in an otherwise black and white world and exemplify the idea of how far one would go for love. Their performances carry this film and keep the audience engaged with the madness going on around them, as they are the most 'normal' of the bunch.
There is not an aspect to The Lobster which I do not respect, I think that it is a daring film, that perfects the risks it takes. It is a gorgeous looking film (with its standard-looking shots), the aesthetic of the movie seems to be carefully put together and that sort of attention to detail does not go unnoticed. The Lobster, is also very humorous, with dark jokes planted throughout that are usually accompanied by a score that feels grandiose, giving the comedy an extra layer.
Although I have gloated about the movie and cannot find a single imperfection, I was not the biggest fan of the film. I can sit here and respect the filmmaking all day, however, it should be noted that this was not my favourite film ever while watching it. It's not something I can outright explain and might require further viewings to fully love, however, I just do not feel the need to rewatch this film right away. I found myself a little bored halfway through, to no fault of the film, as I feel its pacing mostly works. It might just be one of those films I can highly respect but don't get a lot of enjoyment out of, outside of breaking down its somewhat complex themes. For that reason, although I appreciate the craft, and the length the filmmakers went to when making this film, it is not something I can recommend to anyone. It is a very weird film, and some of the ideas may not resonate with a general audience. I'm not doubting my feelings could change towards this film, but as it stands right now The Lobster gets a 7.5/10"
" Not even worth 1 star
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,1,"Sad sad excuse for a film.
I really have nothing to add...
Crude and un-necessary
Total waste of time..."
" Broad satire of relationships. Maybe too broad.
",2020-10-22 00:00:00,6,"When I saw ""Dogtooth"" I assumed that the actors' flat, affectless delivery of lines stemmed from the particular circumstances they were in. Now I see that this is more or less Lanthimos's jam.Lanthimos satirizes romantic relationships, and the societal pressures around them in the same way he dealt with familial relationships in Dogtooth - by making the rules strange, arbitrary, and difficult to break without running afoul of someone or something in power.Here, single people have just 45 days to find a partner, or they'll be turned into an animal of their choosing. This leads to people rushing into relationships based on commonalities, however trivial, rather than bonding in a true and natural way.However, when David escapes and discovers a group of loners, it turns out that the loners are just as bad. No romantic activity of any kind is allowed. Not even flirting, and this rule is enforced in horrifying ways.What I see here is, on the one hand, fear of lonliness, and on the other, repression of intimacy.So when David and the Short Sighted Woman fall in love naturally, it offends the loner leader, so she has the Short Sighted Woman blinded. Now they have ""nothing"" in common anymore. This leads David to a decision to blind himself, just so they can have this characteristic in common.Anybody who's been around the dating block a few times knows these feelings. The fear of loneliness and the perceived pressure to find a mate. The ""helpful"" friends who want to set you up, etc, and conversely, the reluctance to get too intimate too quickly.While I enjoyed the film, and its satire resonated with me, I do understand why so many people dislike this film. It's very slow. The satire is exaggerated to the point that makes you think, ""is it really that bad?"" and decide that it's not. After seeing this and Dogtooth, I do wonder what Lanthimos's personal relationships are like.I would like to see more of his films to decide if he's got a full, coherent worldview here, or just a few tricks to create an atmosphere of awkwardness and alienation."
" Well...
",2020-10-09 00:00:00,9,Brilliantly creative utopia... Leaves you very much unexplained and empty handed at the end tho.
" Wierd but interesting.
",2020-10-05 00:00:00,8,After a while I met a new sci-fi/fantasy concept.The acting was perfect although the ending could be better.It was slow but a mixture of comedy-romance-sci-fi.
" this movie is so weird...so very very weird..
",2020-10-03 00:00:00,6,"A series of set-pieces and settings seemingly in effort to explore the protagonist (Farrell's) ultimate desires: what does he really want in life, and is he sure of it? It all kept me interested, and I really appreciate the underhanded and subtle comedy, and great framing."
" No. Just no.
",2020-10-01 00:00:00,1,"One star, because I cannot select zero stars. Lots of questions. Is this the film the screen writer imagined? Is this the film the actors imagined when they read the script and signed on? Is this the film the director always dreamed he would make? Imagine an off-off-Broadway pseudo-intellectual self-indulgent display posing as avant guard edgy art. This isn't that good. This exercise in self-gratification would result in film characters being turned into animals (can't explain in this space). I suppose mainstream actors (Darrell, Weiss, Coleman, and Reilly) must feel some form of guilt in making millions off popcorn light pop culture films. So sad. To atone for their guilt, they sign onto a low budget ($4M) Indy project for the sake of the art. Well, their souls should certainly feel purged after this. Apparently, in this absurd dystopian future society, social skills are absent. Everyone speaks as if struggling through an ESL night class. Their physical movements are stilted for no apparent reason (Imagine C3PO but with less grace). I can't imagine a big studio producer or director watching this a thinking,""My God, I have to get her/him for my next big project."
" Yes, animals are killed and people are maimed throughout.
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,8,"I liked the movie. The pace could have been a little quicker, and some scenes could have been shorter or eliminated all together, but overall I thought it was quite funny. The ending was brilliant. If you don't get it, watch more closely. The whole screen goes black. Recall: In this world couples have to have a ""defining characteristic"" in common.If you like your entertainment to be completely literal, then you will hate this film. Yes, animals are killed and people are maimed throughout. It's a satire."
" What a movie!
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,9,"The Lobster is a surreal deadpan comedy about the strangeness of social pressures and modern relationships.The setting is a bleak, tightly controlled hotel on the coast of Ireland. David (Colin Farrell), a recently divorced Architect, is given 40 days to find a partner or else be transformed into an animal of his choosing; in this case, a lobster. Sound strange? That's just the first 10 minutes. Guests of the hotel are subjected to routine trips to shoot 'loners' with tranquillisers, and awkward high-school dances to entice singles to mingle. As David's days start running out, he decides to feign common interest with a heartless woman in order to escape his fate. But can he pull it off?Farrell really hits the mark with this role, displaying awkward machismo and fragile humility in equal measure. His comedic timing is matched only by his supporting cast that includes John C. Reilly, Ashley Jensen, and Olivia Coleman. Rachel Weisz is also spot-on as the short-sighted woman.This is a movie following the best tradition of the Hellenistic tragicomedies combined with the uniquely modern peer pressure of the society and complicated rules of the relationships in the near future.
Extraordinary love story set in very bleak environment of Ireland. David (Colin Farrell), a recently divorced Architect, is given 40 days to find a partner or ... he will be transformed into an animal of his choosing; in this case, a lobster. Sound strange to you? This is just a start... wait for the development of the characters! Perfectly done with great skills in writing, directing, acting and everything else, from cinematography to editing!"
" Good start poor ending
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,6,"Basically what the title says. The first half is good, the second half is pretty disappointing. Had potential, but I didn't really enjoy it."
" Totally awful.
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,1,"So bereft of any human emotion, The Lobster sacrifices everything in an attempt to be ""absurdist dark comedy"", and fails in every single aspect. Most of the film consists of awfully written dialogue, unnecessarily long shots, and it tries so unbelievably hard to be artistic that it loses any sight of what a film should actually be, and is so ridiculously boring. The plot of the film is hard to describe, but it just pisses me off how often it tries to make the plot ""interesting"", by throwing in characters, or shots that are added just to confuse the viewer. Most of the film has cruel intentions, throwing people off of buildings, only to suffer to death, kicking dogs to death, and blinding people for seemingly no reason. This film is not funny at all. I laughed maybe once or twice, but only because the film was so bad. I hate this artistic garbage, and it seriously felt so preachy, boring, and unfunny. I dislike this movie so very much, because it's very bad, but it thinks it's so good."
" This is a great movie, but i dont have that much to say about it
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,8,"Everything about this movie is great. From the performance from collin ferrel, to the sudden switches from comedy to a type of dystopian horror moments. The ending is great also. Everything about this is amazing. I dont have that much more to say about this movie. Watch it, its a great movie."
" Unique, beautiful and thought provoking.
",2020-09-07 00:00:00,8,"The Lobster is one of the most original films I've ever watched. The concept behind it is extremely unique, it not only brought to table a new concept but also executed it beautiful, for the most part atleast.Many people like to think of it as a film that comments on how single people are seen through the lens of a judgmental society but honestly I disagree, that's true only to an extent imo. I think it's not just about single people but about people in general, about how different communities are judgemental towards one type of people and accepting towards one type of people, a film about how people with different mindsets and ideas at times just cannot accept the fact that anyone who disagrees with them too can walk on a path that is rightful, so they must apply their idea of salvation on everyone, for example some toxic parents who want their kids to be just like them, for, if they turn out any different no matter how successful they might be, in the eyes of those parents they'd still be a faliure, basically what I mean to say is that it shows how a cruel modern day society sets certain goals for it's individuals which must be met.
I say all this because we encounter two very different communities throughout the film one being the hotel that hates singles and one being the outside people who hate couples.
It also shows the selfish nature of human beings specially in the ending.Oh and the cinematography was beautiful, it was pure art imo.Although I did love the movie but in the end it kinda didn't feel as powerful as I expected it to be.Still an 8/10 for me"
" Simply can't understand the high rating
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,1,"The plot summary sounded promising and it was high on my list of movies to watch. What a big mistake! It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I feel compelled to write an honest review to warn others. The movie is full of stiff and pretentious dialogues and the characters are absurd, stupid, unrealistic and unbearable. After the first hour I started playing it in faster speeds but then during the last half an hour I simply gave up. I've never felt so angry after watching a movie and I wish I could have my precious Sunday morning back. Definitely avoid this unless you are one of those who can find meaning looking at a black square. I would give it 0/10 if that was an option."
" Worst movie ever made. Couldn't get through half of it
",2020-08-28 00:00:00,1,Awful.. dark... disturbing.. and violent! I officially hated it. Very disgusting and containd violent shots of animal abuse
" good experience
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,7,"This film is the fourth film I've seen by Yorgos Lanthimos and I can easily say that this man is crazy! To be honest, my thoughts about Yorgos Lanthimos films have not been generally positive, but this film has changed all my ideas. The subject of the film's criticism, and the fact that it takes place in a dystopia, deeply affects the feelings of the audience. I can't say there are no shortcomings, but the subject is so engrossing so that you can ignore it. Besides, I want to say something about Colin Farrell. I always thought Colin Farrell was a very talented actor, but in this film Colin Farrell has shown his talent in another dimension! After the film is finished, we can say that it will be a film experience that you will think about for a long time, especially the colors and the emotions of the colors seemed to touch the soul of the person."
" Concise and Critical on Society's Moral Values
",2020-08-13 00:00:00,7,"The social commentary, exploration and criticism that it provides for societal expectations and norms of coupling, heteronormarcy, co-dependency, adulthood, a one sided toxic perception(s) or portrayal of 'romance', intimacy and sexual gratification, fascism and tyranny is actually quite intriguing to not only be challenged on but also with a viewing experience of The Lobster, it highlights that these social factors must be challenged, changed, applied individually and not collectively as humans are rather rather complex within ourselves.We have to a moral standard that should be upheld and The Lobster does a great job in terms of highlighting how exactly we are able to go down immoral expectations of each other and ourselves. Ultimately, we do not have to uphold certain societal norms and values such as being subjected by fascism and toxic regimes, we hold power as people to change things for the better through challenging them firstly.It portrays these immoral expectations and rules put in place by regimes by presenting a considerably extreme concept of coupling etc, however the message still stands strong and bold nonetheless.I would like to think that Yorgos and Efthimis thought to provoke and incite commentary on a human's obsession with over saturated ideas of love and what gives life meaning altogether. Ideally, I see the film as a screenplay which is providing an argument which states that upholding tradition and powering through unstable unions is not the answer or the cure for loneliness, unhappiness and death.Additionally there are some great notions to challenge on expectations of genre roles, gender role enforcement, support of patriarchy, subordination of women. The film really is succinct, gets to the point, found myself rooting for the protagonist, great exposition set up, shots and narrative progression.This line alone sums up a lot of the film's exploration of union and how intrinsically toxic they are capable of becoming
'...If you encounter any tension, arguments that you cannot resolve yourselves, you will be assigned children, that usually helps a lot'"
" Holy Cow
",2020-08-12 00:00:00,8,The Prisoner blended with Black Mirror and The Hunger Games. Dictation coach from Napoleon Dynamite worked with the actors. It's as if Wes Anderson directed Children of Men.I haven't been this intrigued since Mother!
" Clever, bleak, stylish
",2020-08-11 00:00:00,9,"This movie is hilarious, but the jokes are all bleak and take a serious tone which makes it even better. It reminds me a little of Fargo in its bleak hilarity, but the lobster is intertwined with philosophy that is very interesting and thought provoking."
" I'm not quite sure what I just watched... but I'm pretty sure I loved it
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,8,"The Lobster is so unapologetically bonkers its hard not to love it. It will leave you feeling very confused and gobsmacked after finishing, it certainly did me at least!I'm not quite sure where to start with this, but perhaps the plot is a good place to kick off. It's bizarre, there's no avoiding that. I really haven't seen anything like it, and am not sure I ever will again. Yorgos Lanthimos created such a wickedly weird and creative near future world, where nothing made sense, yet within its own little world it all worked and clicked., making perfect sense. There were so many little details and nuances, so many interesting threads being plucked constantly, and so much to take in given the relatively short two hour runtime. The story will also keep you on your toes due to its originality and uniqueness, making it very hard to predict.The performances throughout were excellent. The film demanded almost very flat, levelled and stoic performances, with not much surface level emotion, and all of the cast delivered this excellently, giving the film a haunting and sinister feel. As the leads Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz were great, with solid supporting performances from the likes of Olivia Coleman and Lea Seydoux.The whole style of the film worked so well. From the booming and sporadic score to the bleak colours and the camera work. Everything fitted together to make a truly intriguing piece of cinema.This film most certainly won't be for everyone, with its eccentricity either winning you over or putting you off. For me it was this uniqueness that gave it its charm and drew me in. It's as strange as anything, but all the better for it!"
" A lack of empathy does not equal dark comedy!
",2020-08-04 00:00:00,1,"I love dark comedies: Fargo, Dr. Strangelove..., Life of Brain, etc. but this film is not a dark comedy. It is just incredibly disturbing. There's no comedy, just darkness. Dark comedies have quirks to them and rules that make them such. People suffering is not comical. Deadpan absurdly used while implicit violence is happening is not genius. The shock value is not brilliant. It is a nulling and lacks imagination. I am even more annoyed that this won critics over. I HATED this film."
" Bizarre but Good
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,6,"I don't know why I watched this movie. It has a bizarre but good story. But the screenplay never delivers it. In short, the story of this movie is more interesting than the movie."
" Very dreary !! Not comedy and not entertaining!!!

Ugly movie , Zero rate deserve"
" Left me cold
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,6,"Creative in immersing us in into this absurd, dystopian world, but lacking a payoff. It's too clumsy as an allegory for dating, too contrived/inexplicable as drama, too cheesy in its love story (that ending, oof), and not funny enough (or at all?) to be comedy. Could there be a collection of more awkward, robotic, and violent people? Anyway, points for originality and the beautiful cinematography, but this one left me kinda cold."
" Disappointed
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,7,There were no lobsters in the movie. The title clearly mentions lobsters.
" I wish there was a zero out of 10
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,1,The movie starts really good and promising and then doesn't use all of what it started in favor of introducing something creative and different. It just ends up with showing some meaningless weirdness that doesn't end up too well. Not to mention that there's no ending to the movie after all of watching it.
" Absurdism in society.
",2020-07-07 00:00:00,7,"With scenes as beautiful as dramatic, intelligent touches and good (rare) acting quality, The Lobster is a different movie, extravagant and yes, very rare.
Single men and women must meet in a hotel and get a partner for the next few days, otherwise they will be turned into animals and abandoned. That premise alone sounds peculiar enough, but watching the movie is even more so. Although it is categorized as a comedy and romance, I must admit that I didn't find room within any of those categories. I didn't consider this movie funny at any time, on the contrary, it is disturbing. Don't consider it a romance either, because it's more of a criticism of that romance. This is where the film shines by showing us a palpable message about ""love and society"". A look through a different lens that takes us into a world as pessimistic as it is optimistic, a world without contradictions where everything is perfect, and yet, wrong; a false world.It's worth seeing, even if it feels strange and somewhat tight, and fails miserably in its touches of ''comedy and romance''. It's worth just because of how... rare it is."
" How to watch Lanthimos
",2020-07-03 00:00:00,8,"Alright alright alright. If you can not stand blood, deadpan (intentional) line delivery, dry and dark/ridiculous/diabolical humour (works for me but I can imagine for many it wouldn't stand a chance) - don't watch. You'll get angry and frustrated. You either like Lanthimos or not. And either way it can be justified.
But if you can march through all that, you'll ne satisfied. You'll laugh out loud (scene when the hotel owners sing at the banquet or when loners are dancing with headphones - this really happens at festivals: was this Lanthimos poking them or not beats me, but since I always found it ridiculous, it worked for me). This isn't intuitive, feel-it-all movie; it's rather made to make us feel kind of uncomfortable - because, how many times have we obeyed to the rules of society? Are we going to do anything to fit in? What is the merit of a successful relationship? We see a relationship 2 relarionships built on a lie (nosebleed couple: we don't see them part, even when the lie is told - perhaps some are okay with a little illusion? David and heartless woman can't stay together because he shows emotions - hence, she can't stand that) Besides, who can say that we can only function if we are alike, or even if we have identical traits (as over the top depicted here) - nothing, nothing but caring for other human being and working for your relationship can make you two last:even then nothing/no one guarantees you a happy ending. Maybe the ending is open because Lanthimos himself is not sure: how much are we ready to sacrifice ourselves for happiness of our loved ones? For me, there are two thesis on this:
1. David is again *blinded* by love, so he smashes that knife into his eyes
2. David hesitates because he is aware that love, no matter what the sacrifice is, is prone to ending.
However, I believe more in the option no. 1. The owners of the hotel represent the lack of will for sacrifice - David and the blind woman might just be their opposite pair."
" Different and weird but not bad.
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,7,"It's a bit slow but I like the idea of this movie. It's very different which I liked. I feel like they could have gone a little bit bigger or maybe a little bit more drastic with the idea. However, it's not bad. The concept is intriguing. I didn't quite understand the ending until I read about it and now it makes sense. *Kind of a spoiler* It talks about how that society has made people believe that in order for you to have a successful relationship, you and your partner must have a defined common characteristic that you both share. For example, nose bleeds that occur out of nowhere, nice hair, a limp, bad eyesight, etc. Again... a little slow but intriguing and different."
" eww no. an absurd, disturbing allegory where nothign makes much sense.
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,3,"As a movie, it's slow. As a story is absurd. As a sci-fi, it's weak, as nothing really is explained or makes sense. As a comedy, there are no jokes and if anything, it was disturbing. Yes it's supposed to be an allegory, but come on. Nothing makes sense."
" POINTLESS
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,1,I cannot understand how a film as pointlessly dark and ridiculous as The Lobster has more than a 3 star rating. All I can assume is those with more discerning tastes choose to avoid this pos and spend their time on more useful endeavors. I watched this monstrosity with my husband and it made me nauseous. So many other ways to convey the same message of conformity.
" The tone was great
",2020-06-18 00:00:00,9,Yes this film isn't for everyone and I think that's what makes it special. The fact that it isn't for everyone means there will be a lot of haters who just don't get it or are so used to watching something that is predictable they aren't really sure how to handle a film that takes these kinds of risks.I really liked the tone and the uniqueness of this film and I give them a visual high five for being so different.
" Good idea, terribly executed.
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,3,"Unnecessary violent scenes (violence promotes more violence): the killing of the donkey and the killing of the dog.
Lacks the entertaining factor every film must have IMO. There are other films that are complex and hard to understand but are still entertaining to watch."
" what the hell was this
",2020-06-15 00:00:00,3,"Man .. I don't know .. may be I don't have the wits to understand such movies or may be whatever .. I just didn't get anything except the plot.The plot was not so tough to understand to be honest. In a dystopian society any single person has 45 days to find a partner else they would be converted in to an animal of their choice.
And that is it .. that is it of the horror that ""The lobster"" was.I don't care if there were hidden meanings in there or black comedy or something which I overlooked .. I don't care .. All I know that this movie is nothing but a frustrating watch.
Please do not and save yourselves."
" The Worst!
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,1,"I laughed a few times but outside of that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was not an intelligent film at all, as some have mentioned. It was just stupid, nothing deep to it at all."
" Just too weird
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,1,"Comedy????? A Weird, boring movie thar gives and leaves you with a really bad and heavy feeling. I regret watching this. It Really didnt add anything to my life. Who rated this as Comedy???"
" Huh okay
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,7,I really wanted to LOVE this movie. A few times where I was like-this is the best movie I've ever seen ahhh I'm so intrigued. The majority of the time-ugh what a bore fest! Definitely give it a try! Beautifully done cinematically. Super unique and awesome concept. Not executed perfectly. Dragged on a little too long. Lots of fun twists and turns though!!
" Pretentious poo
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,3,"This movie was ok until mid-way then it lost steam and fell into a pool of acid that dissolved the story into pretentious mush.I went to film school, so I'm not surprised there's a following for this movie. I definitely liked Colin's performance and the setting was perfect. But other than that, it was just kinda boring and didn't know where it wanted to go despite having cues built into itself.Nothing felt organic. As if the filmmakers were trying to fit elements into the movie for the sake of it, but with no true purpose. Wasn't my cup."
" Atrocious.

" Don't watch
",2020-05-24 00:00:00,4,Stopped 49 minutes in hated it. Just not worth the wasted time.
" Too strong for most to be shown their emptimess
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,9,Excellent movie. I had a few good laughs. It glued me to my chair in anticipation of what would happen next. Very original and at the same time very reflective of the everyday automatics of our relationship culture.
" Total turkey!
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,1,"The worst film I have ever seen. I like wierd, I like dark but this was neither despite what it tried or pretended to be. I will forever wonder how such an all start cast became embroiled in such an awful film. The dialogue was awful. The narration by Rachel Weiss so annoying. The lowest score I can give it is a 1 but if I could I'd give it a minus. Dont even give it a chance out of curiosity, it will just leave you feeling very angry if you waste your time watching this hogwash!"
" Original and Bold
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,10,"This is remarkable filmmaking. I love a film that is so fresh and daring, and this ticks all of those boxes. It is funny, disturbing and profound in equal measure."
" I can only blame myself for watching this through
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,3,It was somewhat entertaining however there were no monumental scenes. The end of the movie is what made this so horrible. It's as if they ran out of money and couldn't finish filming. I don't get it.
" How do films like this get a green light?
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,1,"A better question is how credentialed actors lend themselves to such a project. A totally preposterous story line, if there is even a linear thought here. A wooden script, read by actors as if they are still sitting around the rehearsal's first reading. If this is the future, then it's good we are living now."
" Absolute Trash!
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,1,"One of the most disgusting pieces of garbage I have ever seen. Didn't even make it half way through before I found myself running to the trash can to vomit from the filth I had witnessed. Some of the most unnecessary, disturbing, and graphic content I had ever seen. Don't watch unless you want to be scarred for the rest of your life. The makers of this movie are absolute trash human beings."
" Comedy or a horror movie?
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,6,"This is definitely some kind of parody, but the intentions are not clear to me, it is funny, but the style is very horror alike. I liked it, but it was a very weird movie."
" Found love in strangely ways
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,7,"Really love the out of the box idea for implement what love means. When you found your love, yes there is must be something that called sacrifice. But, I think the title ""The lobster"" is not quite represented the whole movies."
" Very original, Very clever
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,8,"The Lobster is creepy and bizarre and very entertaining.
Colin Farell is amazing."
" WORST film I have ever watched
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,1,"This film pretends to be a "" romantic comedy"" nothing about this is funny or romantic unless you get off on watching living creatures be tortured for entertainment. If you enjoy and feel romanced by watching people and animal cruelty for unnecessarily long periods of time then this is the film for you. It's one thing for a film like this to be made- ok there are some very dark and twisted tastes out there and that should be described as a different genre instead of ""romantic comedy"" this repulsive movie should not be in the same genre/comedy as a movie like ""You've Got Mail"" for example, which IS a romantic comedy.It I is incredibly misleading and downright dangerous to keep pushing this film as a comedy! I tried watching this move when it first came out with my fiancé because every review was talking about how it's a comedy about love. We planned date night around it thinking we had a special night ahead. We are both animal (especially dog) lovers and this film deeply disturbed both of us. This is unbelievably disgusting to market a film like this as a comedy. I never finished the movie, it's been years since it came out now and I still have nightmares about it. This film ESPECIALLY needs a disclaimer for anyone struggling with mental health, has ever had suicidal thoughts, or that may be triggered by violence. There are very sick people in this world that think this is ""funny and romantic"""
" NO ENDING???????
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,4,"Ok it is a good premise, acting, directing, and I wanted to give this a 7 BUT IT IS SO SLOW it really could've been such an interesting eerie comedy suspense but instead it is like 2 separate films it is so long and then it just ends and you don't know what happened so you invest all that time for no conclusion?
Eh. Glad I watched it I guess but very frustrating end."
" Does Anything Matter?
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,9,"I'm not sure if nihilism has ever been better reproduced in a film. The film begins, meanders along, does some murders, and then it's over. Was anything gained? Was anything lost? I'm not sure. But it's darkly funny and hilarious in every way. I wish more movies would feel this free to take leaps as it explores its singularly vicious world."
" Worst Movie I've ever sat through
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,1,Was hoping to watch something twisted with a slight sense of dark humor. Didn't laugh once during the film. Movie had no real story. So dull. Biggest waste of 2 hours. Whoever thinks this movie is golden should blind themselves.
" An odd, yet interesting little movie
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,7,"An odd, yet interesting little movie with brilliant story and strong performances. Liked it way more than I thought I would and I'm sure I will like it even more after a second viewing."
" Curious film, good weird beginning
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,6,"Curious film, good weird beginning, .. but it gets weirder and weirder throughout the movie.. a bit frustrating, I was expecting more from the ending"
" Brilliant
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,8,"This is a brilliant movie. Brilliant idea that I doubted that it was adapted from a novel but I think it's an original screenplay. I would certainly love that it was a series not a movie, I wasn't satisfied enough with the small portion I watched. Regardless the story, acting and cinematography were very good but not that noticeable.
I really don't want to give it a 9 so it's a full big round 8"
" the lobster
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,7,"The lobster is a film that for the most of parts i enjoyed very much and it made me laugh and smile in a few scenes more then modern comedys,maybe that is becase this film puts more darker comedy that workes for this kind of film and it blends with a story in a very good way,farrel give a very impressive performance and he grow in my eyes after watching him in this and killing of sacred deer,rest of cast was also very good and they give film neceserey quality moments and some good use of comedic situations,lobster is a film that was very interesting ,towards second act it become to be repipative and ending was weaker to me but i still had fun time with this original project"
" P a t h e t i c
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,2,"Stay away and don't watch, This movie is around 2 hours however the pace of the movie makes it like 6 hours of the boring, illogical story.. this movie needs a user manual to understand even when if you have the user manual you can't enjoy such thing! miserable experience."
" Outstanding if you ask me.
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,9,"Such a unique film. The trailer makes this film seem like some sort of quirky comedy. However, watching the first 15 minutes will set the record straight: that that is far from the truth. This film is truly funny at times, but overall a dark study of human beings and relationships. Lanthimos strips human behaviour back to its core, without complex emotion. It's excellent. It leaves a lot unspoken and one is left to wonder about the context of the world we are thrown into, so it's perhaps not suited to the most mainstream of movie goers. But if you want something unique, unsettling and intriguing, this is your film."
" I don't know what to say
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,6,"Just like 'The Maze Runner', but more odd.
I mean, if you like out-of-the-blue creativity without any logic. It is exactly it. Absurd reality with strange laws.But make no mistake, a well made movie, I guess, of whatever they were 'trying' seems they succeeded in it.At best, I can get that the movie is a commentary on 'compromise' we do in love and relationship, the lies we say and betrayl to make things work.So called 'matched couple'."
" Life is too short to see this
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,1,"This is, by far, the worst movie I've seen this century. I wanted to turn it off after 20 mins but son & hubs wanted to see more. They wanted to turn it off half way through and I regret not supporting that notion at that point. Positively miserable movie with an absolutely stupid, abrupt ending. We use the rating of exclusively to select movies and why this is rated 7+ is totally misguided."
" Great satire and hyperbole
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,10,"This film is neither pretentious nor stupid. This is a great representation of what it feels like to want to fit in: people will do whatever it takes. Starting from sitting and chatting with people you don't like and don't care about and ending with sacrificing (well, at first it seems like that) your life for a partner you have nothing in common with. Just wanting to fit in.
When or if you decide that you don't want to be a part of this group after all, you eventually come across another group that (as with the first one) seems great and just for you. But this one has it's ridiculous limits too.
You try to fit in even inside the couple you're in, holding on to one thing you have in common and even HERE you had to search for it.
We really are like that. ""The Lobster"" just exaggerates our lives a little bit."
" THE LOBSTER (2015) - 26/03/2020
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,8,"The Lobster is inventive, transporting, but still relatable, rooting the nexus of it's weirdness on the same awkwardness and anxiety everyone feels with the prospects of prolonged romantic courtship. The Lobster is a captivating and unusual creation deserving of it's spotlight and surefire future cult status amidst lovers of the weird. Highly recommend checking this out.Mitchell Bulfin"
" Dull waste of my time
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,1,This is it. The worst movie I've ever seen. I'm begging you to not waste two hours of your precious life on this lifeless garbage.
" Nothing exceptional
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,2,What was only worth was the music choices throughout the movie and one single scene where * spoiler alert * a person was forced to choose between being killed or shooting his own partner with a gun. Chose the latter but the gun wasn't loaded. Good luck now bro :-)
" weird and painful
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,3,It^s a tough task to watch it until the end. powerful messages but totally unbearable realization.
" A surrealist observation of marriage and love
",2020-03-22 00:00:00,8,"What a strange, grim movie. Yet it was surprisingly enjoyable. Let's go over the surrealist aspects of the film first: if you're the type of person who wants logical explanations, realistic premises, or any kind of closure in a film, then this is not for you. The Lobster is relentlessly absurd, and it demands a lot more out of its viewers than most other movies.I love this kind of weirdness. Yes, the themes of this movie could have been explored in a more realistic and comprehensible manner. But we have so many of those already. I'm glad these kinds of movies can also exist.So is the message of this film about love? Kind of. It's more about the institution of love. We have no federally enforced love laws, but societal pressures can sometimes be just as powerful. Anyone who's been single for a long stretch of time, especially over a certain age, probably knows how weird and absurd people can be about relationships. How people get annoyingly nosy and how they assume things about single people. How desperate some singles can get. The Lobster is about all this garbage our culture puts on us regarding love and marriage. So yes, it's about love, but not at all a romantic movie.In fact, the bleary performances of the actors brought it down a few points below what I initially wanted to give it. I understand why they were directed like that. The Lobster's dystopia is full of people whose lives completely revolve around staying in these state-mandated relationships. These people are constantly miserable but don't even know it. While this was amusing in the first hour or so, it slowly started to falter as the movie stretched for another hour. I think some more cutting or performance adjusting would've done it good. As the humor faded toward the end, the nightmarish qualities of the movie got a little too real. Too bad ""Deadpan horror"" doesn't work as well as ""deadpan humor."""
" Much too longish
",2020-03-17 00:00:00,3,"It took me quite a while to get what was the point of this movie, since it takes a while for it to let us meet the characters who do not live in the hotel. I did not have the patience to wait and fast forwarded during one of the numerous (far too...) scenes of copulation. Also, the disharmonious music soon got on my nerves.In short: wonderful actors who for sure play their roles the way they are supposed to, but they cannot convey what is not there: something to grasp the interest and not simply wait for ""something"" to move us. The main character being highly unlikable, it is... unlikely..."
" A bizarre but great film
",2020-03-05 00:00:00,7,"Having initially watched this film I just was flabbergasted about how bizarre and weird this film was. The acting felt so strange, just as the plot and everything. But it made me think a lot and the more I thought about the film, the more I started liking it. It's a great reflection of modern day society honestly, it was way more deep than I initially thought. I recommend this for sure."
" Weird does not equal good
",2020-02-21 00:00:00,4,"This movie was very weird, but not in a good way. I thought it was just nonsense that started with a poor premise and went down hill from there. I simply can't understand how this movie rates so highly."
" Absolutely brilliant in every way.
",2020-02-18 00:00:00,9,"With a committed cast, biting black satire, and a script that brings you in at the optimum point in the story and the world in which every scene has been paced and calibrated for maximum dry comic effect. It overstays it's welcome a little at the scrappy backend but it's sureness and dedication and unique bold tone makes for a stupendously dark, funny, twisted science fiction that seems borne from a legendary speculative novel of some sort."
" An overall wonderful and fun film!
",2020-02-17 00:00:00,8,"The satirical nature of the story and acting made this movie a unique experience. I was constantly intrigued by the story line and fell in love with the acting style and dialogue. There were a few moments that felt like you were being beaten over the head with this movie's message, but nothing so bad that it really took me out of the film or affected my view of the story."
" Gawdawful
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,2,"This was painful to sit through. Slow, bizarre and unrewarding.I guess I missed something, critics loved it.Comedy? Not in any traditional sense. Depressing."
" Yorgos, the weirdest man in Hollywood
",2020-01-31 00:00:00,8,"Maybe my favorite Colin Farrell performance ever but I liked Sacred deer more. First half of the movie is fantastic like 10/10 but I didn't like the other half that much. However, the ending is powerful. Maybe I'll like the whole movie more on rewatch. I love the humour in Yorgos' films, they always make me chuckle."
" Unique
",2020-01-30 00:00:00,10,"This film is unique, the the element of darkness mixed with the element of comedy perfectly, strange dialogues with great performances from both Colin Farrel and Rachel Weisz. The music fits so well and the cinematography is beautiful. This movie is strange and makes you think about a lot of society rules nowadays definitely."
" Love against all Oddity
",2020-01-28 00:00:00,2,"Let me start my review by saying that if i could describe this movie in three words they would be: Odd, Weird and Strange.
This is a typical slow paced European movie, with a Greek Director.
I'll start with a small synopsis describing the movie.
Single people in a near future, according to the laws of ""The City"", are taken to The Hotel a kind of reformatory prison, where they are obliged to find a romantic partner in forty-five days OR as a consequence of failing they are transformed into a animal of their choice.
The protagonist (Colin Farell) chooses a Lobster, hence the name of the movie.
Lets start with the GOOD... Colin Farell and Rachel Weiss are great actors, and actually do a good job with the script handed to them. The cinematography, and the scenery used in the movie were nice to see.
Now the BAD... This is the weirdest, strangest movie i have seen by far this year.
The strange bad script, that some might consider to be intellectual and a well done satire, i consider to be just absurd. Nonsense and rubish lines are all over the place. I could excuse the short Budget the director had, and i know this movie tries to be like a theather play, but the fact is that the movie plot is just ridiculous from the beggining till the end with a runtime of almost 2 hours of Borefest. I just laughed in a scene were a women makes a bad suicide attempt, by jumping from the hotel into her demise, but utterly failing. So she stayed on the floor agonizing in pain, screaming! NOW tell me, is this funny or nauseating???
Instead of saying to you to avoid the movie, i recommend for you to see the movie.You will like all the other movies you see in the future so much more.
If you want to see a slow paced, but very well scripted, european vibe movie see BLINDNESS instead it is great. It is scripted after a book made by a Nobel prize winner of my country Portugal called Jose Saramago.
P.S: I Wish a Lobster would destroy this bad script with their bare hands, i mean claws :) I give a 2 out of 10 for the actors performance."
" One of the worst
",2020-01-26 00:00:00,1,I like the idea of the background behind the film - you need to find a mate in 45 days or you are turned into an animal. Quite weird but watched it as it had Colin Farrell in it. How bad was that decision??!!! Just tedious and tedious on top of tedious! I recordeed it on my Freeview recorder so I could fast forward through some of it and I am glad that I did! I didn't miss anything of note. Avoid like the plague!!
" Very weird, strange but an interesting film.
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,8,"Very weird, strange but an interesting film worth checking out."
" Unique and at times fascinating, but painfully dull and dissapointing
",2020-01-18 00:00:00,5,"Frustratingly dull, seemingly pointless, and a waste of potential, The Lobster squanders its could-be interesting concept, for something different and unique, but ultimately unsatisfying. Colin Farrell does a good job as David, the leading man in the film, as well as Rachel Weisz. All the actors in the film truly seem to be fully immersed in the concept and the script, but none truly bring any impressive measures to the table, or stick out significantly. The cinematography does make for a chilling and interesting atmosphere, but in the end does not prove to be of much use, and simply feels out of touch as it goes on. The film is slow, and at times has trouble finding what it wants to be. It can prove to be interesting, and provides some interesting insight into the society it brought up, but not enough to truly seem worthwhile. Again and again, the film proves to be disappointment after disappointment, and proves to be yet another dud this year from A24.
My Rating: 5/10"
" Obviously polarising
",2019-12-20 00:00:00,8,"It's interesting to read the wildly differing reviews. There's no doubt it's a challenging film, but it's definitely worth watching, if only for the remarkable cast. It's a very absurd but oddly accurate reflection on how society views relationships. There are also some wonderful lines, such as : ""if you find yourself arguing a lot, then children will be assigned to you"" and ""There's blood and biscuits everywhere"".It left me thinking for a long time. I have a friend that had a series of failed, rapid relationships but when she started a relationship with a rugby player she complained that she'd have to learn about rugby. I remember pointing out to her that she always changed and attempted to fit into boyfriends ideas of their perfect woman, but she was adamant that this was the route to a perfect relationship. I also have family members that have had children in a vein attempt to save their marriage. I think it's a perfect film"
" Totally pointless
",2019-12-19 00:00:00,1,"This movie is supposedly dystopian, but even dystopian movies depict future societies whose leaders have a vision or an objective that, while unappealing, can be understood. Unfortunately for the viewer, the rules of this dystopian society have no discernible objective. Without including spoilers, I'll simply say that the viewer will be unable to discern whether the new society wishes to limit population, eradicate love, or simply ensure the pairing of like personalities. To add to the confusion, the insurgents opposing this dystopia have rules that - while different - are no less inexplicable and seemingly pointless. One of the advantages of streaming is the ability to advance through the tedium. Anyone who sat in a theater to view this pointless movie and made it to the closing credits either has no life or merely wanted to get their money's worth. To Netflix subscribers I can say only this. Don't expect to be entertained, shocked, surprised, or enlightened."
" A Very Odd, Yet Captivating Film
",2019-12-17 00:00:00,7,"I have known about this movie for quite some time now, but I have always found different reasons to neglect to watch it until now. I always thought that the film looked really weird, which ultimately steered me away from watching it. I finally decided to give it watch, and even though it ended up being far weirder and much darker than I originally expected it to be, I was not pleasantly surprised. The dark humor and extremely cringe-inducing interactions between the characters was incredibly amusing, and was something that you do not see very often in cinema. I also really liked the unique plot of the film, even though it could be confusing at times. The entire cast was great as well, and they all added a lot to the film in their own ways. There were only a few problems that I really had with the film. One being that it was a little long, and really dragged on at times. I think that a few scenes could have been removed to prevent that from happening. The only other issue that I had was the ending. It felt a little bit rushed, and then it ends with a bit of a cliffhanger, which I was not a particularly big fan of. All in all though, it is definitely a film that I would recommend to you if you like original ideas, great acting, and clever dark humor."
" Never heard of this film
",2019-12-06 00:00:00,9,"Watched it and loved it! Strange, Bizarre, Weird all in placed in a film in a enjoyable way to watch for the viewers!"
" Total waste of time.
",2019-11-27 00:00:00,1,"Movie started off interesting, but ended up going nowhere & then a disappointing ending."
" Extremely strange...wasted potential
",2019-11-23 00:00:00,5,"Overall, I much enjoyed the concept of the story. Unfortunately instead of culminating in something meaningful, they chose to take the fork towards the ridiculously odd instead. I gave it a 5 because of the acting and cinematography. If you like movies that are weird for the sake of being weird, you'll enjoy this one. Otherwise, pass. Personally, I found it a waste of 2 hours."
" The Essence of Absurdism According to Camus
",2019-11-20 00:00:00,10,"Yorgos Lanthimos presents the audience with a dystopian society, unlike something such as George Orwell's 1984, or Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, it is simply hilarious. It presents a world riddled with absurdity, Camusian absurdism, it allows the audience to realize the value in uncertainty, presenting a radical and meaningless society, analogous to that of our own. As Camus does in The Myth of Sisyphus, The Lobster poses the statement that life is meaningless, men's desperate longing for the rational, for meaning and purpose, only leads to desperation and irrational behaviors, that is itself absurdism. This is manifested through the pointless rules of love presented in The Lobster's society. The film looks at weather or not one should commit suicide, the futile attempt at happiness, the importance of freedom and uncertainty. The pure awkwardness of the film, the robotic dialogue, the repetitiveness, it is all a means to show us, the viewer, that life is absurd, and while we are at it, just laugh at that fact, what else can we do, but be happy."
" Twaddle
",2019-11-17 00:00:00,2,"Pretentious. Not clever. Not art. Just stupid.
To be dystopian needs to have some relationship with reality. This does not. It views as though it has been written by a 12 year old. It holds your interest until the end, in the hope it has something to say about life or the world. It does not."
" A big miss!
",2019-11-17 00:00:00,5,First half is excellent. Second half is as if they did not know what they were doing anymore. I was disappointed.
" This is the worst movie I've ever seen. It's so bad, it can't even be so bad as to be funny.
",2019-11-16 00:00:00,1,"SERIOUSLY, HOW DOES THIS HAVE A 7.2 ON HERE AND EVERY REVIEW WITH WORDS IS A 1 EXCEPT FOR TWO OR THREE REVIEWS THAT ARE HIGH THAT MUST BE FROM SOMEONE INVESTED IN THIS GARBAGE. This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Not in a good way. I like bad movies. Bad movies that are so bad that you have to laugh at them. This isn't one of those movies. I made it all the way to the end. Don't make the same mistake that I did. Just don't. I can't somebody took the time to actually write this down, much less try to pitch it to somebody. On top of that, find a studio that was receptive to it, and actually make it to filming. What was Colin firth thinking? Is he broke and need the money? Did he not read the script? I wonder how many facepalms he did if he actually watched this. I'd rather pour salt and gasoline in my eyes and ears than to watch this again."
" If you are not similar and do not share the same values life could be difficult together
",2019-11-13 00:00:00,8,The movie has a lot to say about changing nature of modern day relations
" Wow lot of polarized opinions.
",2019-11-03 00:00:00,9,"In my mind just the fact that so many of the ratings are either really high or really low, and the contempt so many have for it, made it worth seeing. Personally, I found the movies black humor funny. It reminded me in many ways of A Clock Work Orange, only less rapey.I think many people are going to be turned off the deadpan delivery throughout the movie, but I found it both strikingly odd and refreshing to see something so different."
" Slower & With No Emotion
",2019-10-23 00:00:00,1,"I'm sure I'm supposed to extract some deep meaning from this, but my only takeaway was the direction ""slower & with no emotion"" must've been uttered every time there was a take 2 (which, judging by the final product, was not often)."
" Very strange... But I enjoyed!
",2019-10-19 00:00:00,7,I can say for certain that you will never have seen a movie like this before. Some of the dialogue is quite funny and very unexpected. The characters are all so very odd.Ashley Jensen and Olivia Colman do a lot with so little. This is the kind of movie I might ordinarily have turned off within 20 minutes but all the very familiar faces amongst the cast made it an intriguing watch.
" Exaggerated One!
",2019-10-17 00:00:00,1,"This is a weird movie! I found this in a list of dystopian movies. Now what I saw here ? Absolute nothing. Screenplay was very slow which becomes soporific. Don't fall for higher rating as well as critic score. Scores can be deceiving too! Like all other Collin Farrell movie this one is also a big loser. Wow, I wish this should be on horror list. There's no way you can relate anything to it."
" Waste of time
",2019-10-09 00:00:00,1,One of the worst films I've ever seen. Hoping for better things with a good cast but turned out to be an absolute waste of time. Don't ever watch it!
" Awful, awful, awful
",2019-10-02 00:00:00,2,"Awfull at almost every level. Pointless, dull, horrible, nasty with nothing to say about anything."
" Dancing on my own
",2019-09-28 00:00:00,6,"The Lobster is an absurdist black comedy with a deadpan narration. It is set in a Dystopian world where being single can turn you into an animal.Yorgos Lanthimos examines both politics and sexual politics. It is an interesting take on the pressure society puts on people to have a companion and the pitfalls of political factions. In some ways this is George Orwell mixed with Monty Python. A kind of modern day Brazil, the movie directed by Terry Gilliam.David (Colin Farrell) arrives in a hotel after his wife has left him. The newly arrived guests have 45 days to find a partner or be turned into an animal. David chooses to be a lobster if he fails to find a suitable relationship.The hotel has strange rules such as forbidding masturbation which can lead to harsh punishment. Guests are encouraged to partner up by attending dances and finding partners who they share something in common with.When David escapes the hotel and heads for the woods. He enters a commune for committed singles who want to be independent but they also have strange and eccentric rules. This includes dancing on their own to electric music and digging your own grave.In the forest David finds romance with a short sighted woman (Rachel Weisz) which is forbidden.The Lobster cannot maintain its offbeat premise. It runs out of gas and just wants to be eccentric for the sake of it. The (deliberate) flat performances and narration soon becomes tiring and its originality fades once David escapes from the hotel."
" Just a poor movie
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,3,"The movie has some good ideas and intentions, but it is just a poorly done boring movie. You could have ideas AND shoot a great movie at the same time, this is not the case."
" Off beat type Movie
",2019-09-21 00:00:00,7,"Different kind of movie - Some like it, some don't."
" Not for everyone
",2019-09-16 00:00:00,10,"I found this offbeat, weird and totally brilliant. This may not be for everyone but definitely a movie you wont forget. Highly recommended."
" What Relationships Are Like
",2019-09-11 00:00:00,10,"Rather than show the trappings of singleness as they are, Lanthimos shows how they feel. It feels like everyone is watching you and evaluating. It feels like you are just looking for something to have in common with other people. It feels like you are just faking it until someone accepts you or else you enter into this sort of forever other life where you no longer matter to anyone because society is for coupe and children, not singles.By creating a world totally unlike our own, Lanthimos is able to highlight feelings that we all relate to rather than situation only a few of us might relate to. We all know what it is like to have sexual experiences that leave us unsatisfied although, hopefully, very few have ever had the experience as it is portrayed in this film.That is the strength of it though. At the end of the film when Rachel Weisz (""The Fountain"") is waiting for Colin Farrell (""In Bruges"") to return to her, we as the audience can sense the tension of a young woman awaiting her groom in the honeymoon suite, or a groom standing at the front of the church waiting for the doors to open, wondering if his bride will be there or has she run off? We feel the fear and pain of telling a hard truth to a husband and waiting to find out if he will stay and endure the hard work to rebuild or leave for easier relationships.The themes in this film cause it rise above simple dark comedy and absurdist situations. It makes the film funny and sweet and daring.Of course the writing and acting help it along as they are both stellar examples of their respective arts. The writing slants just off of normal leaving the viewer with an immediate impression of alienation and solitude. The voice over narration has a calculated cold just-the-facts attitude which has clinical scientific aftertaste.Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz's performances, likewise, do much to convey a sense of confusion, trepidation, excitement, and reservedness which mixes rarely well, not alienating completely the audience yet never giving them the warm comfort of false and easy relationship that so many rom-coms exult in bestowing upon their viewers. They are the performances of wonderful actors who have known the thrill of those sorts of rom-com romances but also can understand those relationships from a mature place of understanding.The whole film is beautifully wrapped up, so to speak in a lingering shot of Rachel Weisz, wondering if Colin Farrell is coming back or not. If he doesn't, she is doomed to die. If he does, they will live on together, closer than ever, but he must blind himself for this to occur.Will he come back? Will he be able to do it? Does he love me that much?For some reason this long hold on her in this diner booth landed on me with a real heaviness that I felt in my bones."
" Avoid at all costs!
",2019-09-04 00:00:00,1,"Why is that every bad movie has so high score and a good movie is so underrated?
This ""Lobster"" was so bad and stupid and pointless and gut-wrenching and it was such a waste of time!
And does anyone knows why Colin Farrell plays in such absurd and awful movies? That's a shame, 'cause he is a great actor..
I want 2 hours of my life back!"
" Depressing and stupid
",2019-08-29 00:00:00,1,"I created an account to write this, so I promise it's worth your time. This movie was super boring and also contains animal cruelty as well as a graphic suicide scene. If you're bothered by animal cruelty in the slightest, skip this one and thank me later."
" Totally pointless!! Disturbing animal cruelty! Truly terrible movie!!
",2019-08-26 00:00:00,2,This is probably the weirdest movies I've ever seen and I don't mean weird in a good way. First of all there is no reason to show the animal cruelty. It was sickening and disturbing. Second of all there were scenes that happen and you never find out why or what happened to these people. There were way too many questions and no answers. The characters would do things that did not make any sense at all. And the characters weren't what I would call endearing. There was almost nothing that they did or said that made me like them and root for their survival. I didn't give one hoot about them. The non emotions of these characters was just stupid. I can't believe I watched the whole thing only to see the inconclusive ending adding yet more questions and no answers.
" Lobsters are for eating, not watching
",2019-08-19 00:00:00,2,"No it's not a screwball comedy. STIR Crazy is a screwball comedy.
It is quirky. But not in a good way.
The acters frequently recite their lines like in a school play with no emotion. Flat, dull and emotionless. ALL the acters. Clearly no one was getting paid much.
The premise is interesting but would be better suited for a short film. And oh you don't even get a resolution at the end just a chick waiting at a table for a loser to stab his eyes out."
" Dull, Tired and Daringly Useless
",2019-08-13 00:00:00,2,"At first intriguing, the spark of interest fizzled like cotton candy dipped in water - flat, still water. This film was pure and simple boredom. The character dialogue was stiff and while the main character did his time in the hotel, it was somewhat interesting with how everyone interacted with one another - from the horrible duet on stage to the private time lap dances. And then it got painful. I kept thinking when will it end, maybe there's a pay off at the end, but NO. The end was so benign and unfinished. I guess I didn't get it. And you know what? I don't want to get it."
" Awfully shocking and shockingly awful
",2019-08-12 00:00:00,1,Echoing what other reviewers said when I say that the trailer is very misleading. I thought it was going to be funny and witty when in reality it was just cruel and unfeeling. I draw the line at animal cruelty and graphic mutilation.
" A sick, sad world.
",2019-08-11 00:00:00,2,"But I am not sure what that audience is.It is strange, robotic, and dark. This would all be good if it was also amusing, or intriguing, but unfortunately the novelty of the plot wears out really fast, characters are empty shells, attempts of black humor fail, and the occasional violence is just making you more depressed.It just isn't clicking well together.I guess there is an audience for this, but I would not recommend it."
" Wtah?!
",2019-08-10 00:00:00,1,"WHAT did I just get forced to watch, WHAT died in Colin Ferrell's gut and on his upper lip, and WHAT did they do to Rachel Weisz's voice?!?!"
" Weird,Funny, and Overrated
",2019-08-06 00:00:00,4,The humor is dull but the situation and setting itself is a great premise for this type of film. Colin Farell was definitely the right choice for this part
" A Creative Stepping Stone for a Brilliant Director
",2019-08-02 00:00:00,6,"Yorgos Lanthimos' The Lobster opens spectacularly, inviting your imagination to explore the grand dystopian future it presents. It proceeds to dole out sharp commentary on society's pressure to find and maintain a relationship at any cost, even by introducing a child to the dysfunction. However, all this goes to waste as The Lobster overstays its welcome. Without much more to say, the film drags along, promising a grand revelation in its finale. Alas, the final scene was telegraphed long ago to anyone paying attention, and lingers in the air like rotting shellfish."
" Bleh
",2019-08-02 00:00:00,4,It was off to a great start but then I suffered through the last half. I wouldn't really recommend someone spend 2 hours watching this unless you're really bored and have nothing left to do. It's weird and kind of funny but there's just not much there.
" Where is Jordan Peterson when you need him?
",2019-07-25 00:00:00,1,The Lobster needs to clean its room! WTF? This movie started good and I liked it -but the second half is soooooo slow and lame. Don't preach. Fix yourself.
" Waste of time
",2019-07-25 00:00:00,1,I'm not sure how this movie was rated so high. Don't waste your time. It is boring and not interesting from the beginning. I kept watching hoping that something interesting will happen because of the high rating this movie has.
" Very Strange Film... that I love a lot
",2019-07-25 00:00:00,8,"I honestly don't even remember how I came across this film, but I am very glad I did.
This strange movie with its creative plot of nothing I had ever seen before, as well as, the monotone speaking, devoid of all emotion, made it very memorable. I am just astounded at how good the actors were at not emoting as much as they are probably more used to. Especially in the situations that take place in this film.
Even though it is a bit slower paced (something I don't particularly care for in movies) it really fit the way of the film and its aesthetic.
It's definitely a movie I recommend a lot, especially to those movie buffs that are more into the not as well-known films that are beautifully made."
" Stupid movie.
",2019-07-23 00:00:00,1,This movie is stupid because stupid people produce movies. Stupid people try to make smart movies but they can't because they are stupid.
" Sucks
",2019-07-16 00:00:00,1,"Don't waste your time. I'd rather sit through 2 hours of root canals than sit through this poor excuse for ""art""."
" Love at it's most basic.
",2019-07-10 00:00:00,8,"Yorgos Lanthimos brings a unique love story that takes romance and sheds it down to the bare and basic. His attention to detail within this film is outstanding with every moment meaning something larger, every scene sends us a thousand words without any of the characters uttering any.A film set within a near dystopian society where being lonely is a crime, people are sent to the mysterious hotel where they are forced to fall in love or else they are to be transformed into an animal of their choice. A mad idea plucked straight out of the genius mind of Yorgos Lanthimos.Collin Farrell plays 'David', the only character with a name who is sent with his brother (who is also a Dog) to THE HOTEL after the death of his wife. He now has forty five days to find a new partner or he will be turned into a Lobster. His performance is pretty good, accurately showing a confused and bewildered loner with nowhere to go.I reccomend this film for anyone who enjoys something different from a director who's imagination knows no boundaries. It is a clever and well put together that I see being considered a classic in the near future."
" the movie doesn't do enough with its gorgeous visuals and one of a kind premise.
",2019-07-05 00:00:00,10,"Synopsis: In a dystopian society, single people must find a mate within 45 days or be transformed into an animal of their choice."
" my notes
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,6,WEIRD! but in a good way. i was very entertained by this. filled with dark humor and ridiculously strange situations. when it started i thought this might end up being one of the worst movies i ever watched. but i was pleasantly surprised. it kept my attention throughout (1 viewing)
" A unique and interesting yet dull film
",2019-06-23 00:00:00,7,"I feel like no matter how many time I watch this film, I'm never going to
""get it"". I can see the commentary on modern relationships and such, but so much of it just doesn't make sense and I'm not sure it's supposed to. The less you now about The Lobster going in, the better the experience will be, so I'll keep it brief and spoiler free. The biggest things that the movie has going for it is the story, which is insane and for every question it half answers, I have three more. The movie is essentially two distinct parts and while I loved learning about how the world worked in the first half, the second half slowed down and stopped addressing my questions. There is too much that they won't explain and instead try and lead you on to another thing. Beyond the very interesting story, there really isn't much else going on. Every character talks in the same emotionless monotone, which sometimes adds to the very dry humor and other times just gets annoying. ""Dry"" is a good descriptor of the whole movie. The camera shots are dry and static, the dialog is dry, every character has basically the same dry personality, the score is dry classical music, everything is ""dry"". I liked the story and occasionally found it mildly funny, but every scene left me wanting more. By the half way point, I was disinterested with the characters and much more intrigued by the world they live in and we learn so little about it. The Lobster is one of those movies that can't possibly find financial success, because it's hard to market to a specific audience. It's listed as a comedy, but it's not really funny, especially for a standard audience. The static monotone acting from everyone got on my nerves and I assume a general audience would find it even more grating. It's a very unique story, but the way it's told puts way too much effort into being ""quirky"" and ""wacky""."
" Bored A LOT
",2019-06-17 00:00:00,3,I really don't recommend this movie. One of the few movies that I drop because I'm so bored.
" Strange yet strangely intriguing
",2019-06-15 00:00:00,8,"It's a weird concept no doubt, and the film never admits this. But as weird as it was, I found myself captivated. That is after all the goal of cinema."
" WHAT A FILM!!!
",2019-06-12 00:00:00,9,"It is really refreshing to see a film of this nature, I believe that Yorgos Lanthimos has really something to say as a filmmaker even though i have only seen this one and the killing of a sacred deer which i found quite brilliant. the best aspect of this film is the dialogue which is hilariously dark, witty and DAMN weird."
" A visual concept should not be confused with quality or originality
",2019-06-12 00:00:00,5,"--The Lobster is pretty aesthetically pleasing. But that is it's strongest point. The atmosphere is heavy, unpleasant, reminiscent of Dogtooth with it's long shots where few things transpire and the tension builds, and any human interactions are severely disjointed. However, Dogtooth had an internal logic which became apparent from the beginning of the movie and remained consistent up until the end. The Lobster on the other hand does a very poor job of describing it's inner mechanisms.--I've tried searching for reviews of this movie to see why it is so highly acclaimed, and they mostly seem to be revolving around the statement ""oh, it's a smart critique of how our society views human interactions."" However, where is the foundation for this statement? The Lobster seems to have been designed to jam a few superficial observations down the viewers throat, but each of these have been previously explored deeply in better works of film or literature. It is a series of superficial and vague statements which are not interconnected by any internal logic within the work itself.--The problem with this is that any set of images can be then interpreted by the viewer while searching for depth, but this does not mean that the movie has any actual depth. Which it doesn't. The characters have all the complexity of cardboard cutouts. This left room for the society in which they live to be a character of its own, but this opportunity is not seized, as the society itself is not elaborated upon in any way. The central source of all tension within the movie are its society's rules, and since their role in society, or the motivation to create them, all remain without explanation, they come off as trite and arbitrary.--In the end, this movie felt rather humorless, pointless and left me hungry for substance. I firmly believe there is a lot of ""art"" in the world which thrives on people ""not getting it"" and then being scared of seeming foolish to those who do ""get it"". Stop this nonsense. There are wonderful, symbolic works of art out there. Go enjoy them and never praise this movie again. I would include suggestions, but the list would be too long and then this would no longer be a review for The Lobster."
" Horrific nonsense
",2019-06-06 00:00:00,1,"Leaving a second review to warn as many people as I can.Please for the love of god, destroy this abomination that has disguised itself as a movie"
" I enjoyed it.
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,7,The people that hate it dont understand that it's an allegory for modern dating. You look at an app like Tinder and its just as ridiculous. The definitely laughed a few times and I found some parts cruel but that's what good movies do. They make you feel stuff.If you liked The Life Aquatic... you'll enjoy this. It really is a dark Wes Anderson type movie. I gave it a 7 because it can be slow at times.
" Waste of time
",2019-05-01 00:00:00,1,The movie looks promising at first however it gets more boring with each passing minute.Probably one of the worst out of there.Comedy? I didn't laugh once.
" SUPER WEIRD PLOT AND WORLD.
",2019-04-29 00:00:00,7,"Find a mate in 45 days, or be turned into an animal. LOL. Super weird plot and world, that takes some time to learn. Once understood it is still weird.
Whilst the concept is flawless and intelligent, the general delivery is dry and boring tbh. But good acting by Mr. Colin Ferrel."
" Bizarre but brilliant
",2019-04-23 00:00:00,8,"Lot of messages, loved the monotone.
I wonder if they had problems from animal rights activists?"
" Match Maker
",2019-04-16 00:00:00,8,"The Lobster is a genius spark of insanity. A great introduction into the eccentric world of Yorgos Lanthimos. Colin Farrell is David, a man in his own personal hell. Welcome to a dystopian future, where single men and women are forced to establish romantic relationships, over the hanging threat that if they don't, they will be turned into an animal of their choice. .. and you thought Tinder was bad. Yorgos gleefully mocks the patriarchy, and has a ton of dark and twisted fun doing it. The characters, the dialogue, the locations among so much else are rich with humor. Unlike most independent films, you'll notice The Lobster consistently standing out on it's own. If you try and compare it to any classic or contemporary piece, you'll come up short. You may love The Lobster or hate it, but either way, you won't forget it."
" Nothing to get here, just pretentious quack!
",2019-04-10 00:00:00,1,"The movie tries as hard as a first semester art
student and fails just as badly.
The story throws up questions en masse but only pertaining to the plot as it has gaping holes. It leads itself ad absurdum with an over-eager drive for strangeness and absurdity leading to nothing and developing nothing.
We are obviously meant to not understand and not to make sense - this is, sadly, a too often used naive attempt in move making."
" Dont judge before watching it two times!!!!
",2019-04-09 00:00:00,10,"Before watching this movie:This is not a normal movieIt is not comedy thoughYou have to understand that you need to watch it two times before judging itThis is one of the deepest movies I have ever watched, immense phylosophy and a unique picture representing how pretentious/doomed we can be!Its a drama of:System Vs no systemLove Vs sacrificeOur real selves Vs our imagesFreedom vs committmentSacrificing for love vs Physical securityExpectations vs actualizationI am not gonna talk about the story or the plotFirst time, watch it and expect to be upset, creeped, even disgusted at some points...continue it till the end2nd time, you will get it all inHope it helps!"
" Could be a Black Mirror episode
",2019-04-01 00:00:00,7,"This is how a Black Mirror episode looked like if it was directed by Lanthimos. A bit slow in some point in the middle.
I failed in finding the moral message at the end, but surely it has."
" A Satirical Dystopian Literary Work!
",2019-03-23 00:00:00,9,"I can't think of any movie that has effortlessly explored the human relationships with such insight, profundity, authenticity, and accuracy. Lanthimos simply took some stereotypes and utilized them flawlessly, thus taking advantage of them in a most potent, effective, and cynical way. I don't the movie to be neither misanthropic nor nihilistic, since it displays both the good and the bad in humans. This is one of these movies that makes you wonder why it hasn't been made before.The Lobster also has one of the most effective uses of voice-over narration in recent years. With a stiff and composed tone lacking emotional weight, the voice-over significantly enriches the film's narrative, particularly for setting its gloomy and dreary tone that seems as if it came out of a dystopian novel, and it's definitely crucial to carry the film's development from start to finish.It's also impressive that both different halves of the movie have worked pretty well; the first half, with its sarcastic and dry sense of humor, and the second half, with its more serious, focused and extremely intelligent less-is-more storytelling. The movie almost scuppered by the major tonal shift between its two halves, and became very tepid, since its humor lost its bite almost completely. But it picked up almost instantly, and became as, if not more, intriguing and riveting as it was in its first hour.An instant classic, The Lobster is a highly original dystopian black comedy that proves that Yorgos Lanthimos is one of the most talented and idiosyncratic filmmakers working today. I can't wait to see more of his films!(9/10)"
" Disappointing ending
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,8,So anyway what can we say about this movie this movie is really not good it's actually very good but the ending sucks it's interesting you have good acting you have an interesting storyline to begin with you have great soundtrack good effects you watched very interesting but then just after three fourths of the movie you are confronted with such terrible nonsense that I won't review for the ones who haven't seen the movie yet but it's it's very interesting only sad thing is that the story at the ending became an example of Hollywood's needing to finish the story when they don't have the IDS yet so stupid if the guy who wrote the story took a bit of more time to work it congrats Jesus it would have been a great movie
" Very Unique and Original
",2019-03-15 00:00:00,8,"Oh My God this film Can't Get in Weirder then this and i love weird stuff, Clever, original, scathing, and sharp Film from the Greek Film-Maker Yorgos Lanthimos. i don't Know Why it took me 4 Years to watch this movie..."
" Trying to elaborate nothing useful in an extremely boring way.
",2019-03-15 00:00:00,1,"I got caught up with the hype, and watched this movie. It's a simply a wana-be master piece but a crap.Director is trying to walk the audience through a dark humourous path towards modern day relationships. He is successful at the cost of 2 hours of my life. Characters are not so human. My point is you don't need to alienate a character's natural behaviour to reference the darkest side of human behaviour. If you are going to watch it, make sure that you are ready to stress yourself.Again... How boring a movie can be, may be 'The Lobster' can be a benchmark.After watching movies like 'Mother', I cannot help myself to rate this 1/10. May be I'm too harsh, but I can't help it."
" Watch it if you want something different and interesting
",2019-03-09 00:00:00,8,"One of the weirdest movies I have ever watched! Weird in a good way! It tells us a lot about our society, and how relationships work in our society. Colin Farrell was great as David and Rachel Weisz was also great as the short-sighted woman. It was weird and interesting, it is set in a world, you do not want to be a part of! But you wanna know about it more. Also, let me make this clear, this is not a movie for everyone, it is a very different kind of movie and doesn't follow any of the cliches set by Hollywood."
" What was the point of this weird movie?
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,4,"I thought it was going to be a dark comedy, but it quickly turned into a twisted tale, with unsavory characters, that dragged on and on for two hours, along with annoying background music.
The lead character showed no emotion, just robotic way of expressing himself, probably instructed by the director to act in that way.
And the plot itself is totally absurd and regressive. Seemed more like a dystopian past, not future."
" Stay Away
",2019-03-07 00:00:00,1,"2, count 'em, 2 hours I'll never get back. It is AWFUL."
" Unbearable Until You Get It.
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,4,"So you think this is a comedy? Think again. That may be a comedy, but only for the director. Let's talk about him: Here is a guy with a few directing skills who is making an effort to get the artistic seal in his film. That kind of 'in your face' thing that any rustic person would notice and leave the cinema with an awkward sensation that you can't bring this artistic job down. All this critics high rates are from this 'awkward with their proud' people who couldn't see through the joke they were in:
At the same time the greek director forces us in this artistic sense, he puts a great effort on doing the most unbearable movie ever made. The funny thing here? It's a movie about people doing padronized paterns determined by a imaginary society. And they try so hard, even mutilating their selves. Anything to match what they are expect for.
In the end of the movie, as you walk away the theater, you struggle your self to make a positive commentary on the artistic aspects of the movie you actually hated. And why? Because, just like all these very well educated critics, you have to be artisticaly sensitive to be accepted as an individual. Just like in the movie. We puppet folks.
When you get it, you can actually have a little smile on your misery, while Yorgos is laughing to death."
" Pretty darn wierd
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,7,"I like the wierd concept of the movie but the plot loses me about halfway through.
Also Rachel Weiz is pretty hot."
" Insulting crime
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,1,"When a film starts with in-cold-blood assassination of a donkey, you must do your best to put the alleged ""co-writer and director"" far away from any human society. If you can't do it, at least do not waste your time to see this junk."
" Please do not suggest anyone Watch this film (or watch it yourself)
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,1,"The best advice I can give to anyone who hasn't seen this movie is to not watch the movie. DEFINITELY do not suggest anyone watch it with you. This is the type of movie that will lead to movie picking probation. Anytime in the future when your significant other or friends have a debate over what film to see, this will be the first and only exhibit presented which will result in an automatic veto of your suggestion. The only acceptable time to suggest this film is if you are trying to end a friendship or get out of a messy relationship. Now on to the movie itself.Pretentious doesn't even begin to describe this movie. You can tell early on that the director was making this for film critics and could care less about the audience. The premise is quirky and is used ad nauseam to pound the same message home.We get it. Society has dumb/superficial rules and traditions that we all go along with. When these rules are shown through the lens of a dystopian society that in some way mirrors our own culture, the absurdity of these rules is revealed. This is a valid point, but the director spends 2 painful hours hammering this same point through escalating, unnecessary violence. ""The audience is about to fall asleep for the 100th time in the first 45 minutes? Cue shot of mutilated dog."" I should have known right then that the film would have no redeeming qualities. At that point, the director had already spent way too much time upping the ante of how disturbed and uncaring the female character was.The story gets even more boring when the main character makes his way to the woods to live with the outcasts. This is when you get to spend another hour+ of your life watching the same point play out. There are quirky rules in this group as well, and the director is going to show you just how brutal and violent the repercussions are if not followed. Did the scene with the mutilated dog not shock you? Maybe cutting peoples lips/mouths with razor blades or forcing someone to have intercourse with a pig will keep you interested in the movie. Don't worry, if you still find yourself in need of more senseless violence, there's also intentional blinding and dogs eating peoples faces off.The movie is a dark, depressing, emotionless film that takes entirely too long to play out. I have no idea why a critic would like this movie. Maybe they were amazed at how the Director was able to bore an audience so thoroughly despite including the most gortesque scenes throughout the film."
" surrealist dystopia
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,9,"After seeing 'The Lobster' I have no doubt that Yorgos Lanthimos is one of the most remarkable film directors living and creating today. Each of his films shocks and disturbs, in each one there are copious doses of absurdity and cruelty. These extravagant and extreme elements are not gratuite as they start from real-world situations (or from history as in his latest film) and amplify them to grotesque and nightmares. The nightmares of the Greek director's films are our very existence, or what it could become. 'The Lobster' is among the Lanthimos' movies I've seen, the best structured and the clearest in message. A mute and tragic scream about the dangers of social and family engineering, about the emptiness of our lives and of the relationships between people.The story takes place in the near future, or maybe it's not even the future. Life in couples is the only legal form of existence. Those who do not have or lose their pair are sent to an institution that looks like a luxury hotel under strict control, where they divide their time between finding the right pair, participating in propaganda-educational activities and hunting animals. However, the animals (important as in all of Lanthimos's films) are actually just ex-humans, because if loners do not find their pair in 45 days (plus or minus a few days won or lost in the hunting games) they are entering the 'transformation rooms' and turned into the animal of their choice. When the hero manages to escape, he discovers the world of the opposants, only in dystopia as in dystopia, the opponents are also fanatics, extremists from the lonely side, any connection between them being also cruelly punished. Falling in love leads to tragedy and happiness is not possible in any of the sides of this dark world.The execution is impeccable. As in all the films of Yorgos Lanthimos, we deal with a world whose rules are only apparently familiar to us. The motives of the actions of the characters are often shrouded in mystery. Emotions are controlled by the laws of a society in which fear has become the main resort. Colin Farrell performs one of his best roles, succeeding in rendering the lack of emotional capabilities and the fear of the absurd and the inevitable that is going to happen with remarkable discretion. Bizarre and absurd seem to dominate the world described in this movie, a universe in which Beckett meets Hitchcock, but is our society so far away from it?"
" Couldn't Even Finish... Not Sorry
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,1,"I had heard such great things about this movie and I normally agree with the critic's consensus. I believe I have good taste and an eye for detail and metaphor. After 40 minutes, I realized I was grimacing reflexively. After nearly an hour and a great deal of vocalized ""whys"" and ""buts"" and witnessing horrible attempts at humor, I paused playback, saw that I was barely past the halfway point (in utter disbelief because it felt like an eternity), and couldn't turn it off fast enough.
I looked at my husband and said, ""I hate this film.""
I didn't care about a single person. The only character I cared about at all was Bob. So after Bob was brutally murdered? No reason to go on. And it was abundantly, gratuitously and tediously clear: there's no moral that any human being that believes in light, beauty, and truth will find resonance with.
Ick. Just... ick."

The plot in the end really makes no sense at all. A utopian society? Really? Finding a mate, hunting or dying or being turned into an animal? Or hunting others for what really?
Nothing to speak of is explained and you slog along trying to find meaning in this film and I found none. I'm a big film buff but this was neither funny or meaningful in any way. That being said, I would take a pass on this film unless you are bored and have nothing else to occupy your brain or your time.
Others found meaning and sense behind it but me, nothing, zero. No humor, no social meaning. What are we reduced to hunting our significant others then killing them or someone else? What and why? You decide whatever this movie means. Some equated it to the The Grand Budapest Hotel, that was funny and you could follow along with the silliness but this, no.
Take a pass, please.Colin Farrell, you are much better than this."
" Like-it-or-hate-it
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,10,"This is a like-it-or-hate-it kind of movie. As for me, I loved it.This is not a movie for those who are looking for fastpaced story-throwing that bombard the senses. The deliberate delays and slow storytelling coupled with awkwardness is darkly funny yet at the same time intensely thought-provoking. This is one of the true dystopian films and important movie to watch."
" Great idea - terrible execution
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,3,"The message this movie was sending about society and singles and couples etc was all great. 10/10 message. The movie itself however was utter garbage. I understand the deadpan way of speaking was supposed to be part of the ""dark humour"" but it got old real fast. That's only one of the many issues with this movie. I gave it a 3 because the first half was ok, it kept my attention enough with an interesting set up. But once it moved outside the hotel I was on my phone playing apps, waiting for it to be over. It's a pretentious, artsy fartsy movie that tries way too hard to be clever."
" Lost Opportunity to Explore a Brilliant Idea
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,6,"I totally understand the artistic value of this film. I loved the idea behind it as well as the visual and score. I loved noticing that whenever we'd see people in the woods we'd also see a variety amount of animals walking behind them, indicating that many of those animals were formally people who weren't able to find their partner. I thought that was a pretty decent sight gag. I also thought the classical music during certain scenes was a nice touch; whenever it'd intensify or slow down I felt as though I was feeling the emotions of the characters on screen unravel. The fact that the majority of the music was repetitive was quite funny which I'm assuming is what they were aiming for. The shading/lighting of the film was beautiful as well, and the acting was quite good.
However, as far as the plot itself, it sort of felt...dull in most cases. In the beginning, it's very clear what the motivation was. You must find a partner within 45 days otherwise you will become an animal of your choosing. As the film went on, you begin to learn that there are ""loners"", who are people that refuse to become an animal after their 45 days were up (or people who decided to escape the hotel). Up until that point, I thought the movie was going brilliantly. It wasn't until David ended up being part of the loners did I feel like the writers were having a bit of a challenge on where they wanted the movie to end. As a viewer, I assumed that either way it went, we'd come to find that someone would be an animal or in love. And because of how heavily they pushed the rule of ""you will be an animal if you don't find love"", I began to believe that we'd ultimately end up with a sad ending where David becomes a lobster. Frankly, I would much rather prefer a bittersweet ending like that rather than what we got. It left me wondering...what was the point of having people turn into animals in the first place? I really believe that this idea would've been absolutely perfect had they done a better job at it.
Towards the end of the movie, we are left with a cliffhanger on whether or not David blinded himself for the woman who became blind after breaking the Loners' rule. It left me completely unsatisfied. Not only was I expecting a more psychological twist, but now I was faced with a question from the director: What do you think he did? The answer is simply...I don't know. I would like to think that perhaps he chose not to do it and instead went back to the hotel where he decides to become the lobster he mentioned earlier because it seemed too important to him for the ending to be left the way it did. If they'd explored that idea more, I think I would've enjoyed it better. Overall, I do recommend this film. It's not a complete waste of time. Its aesthetic is to be boring and stiff to portray the way David feels throughout it, which I find interesting. There are probably points that I missed or something that completely went over my head with this movie, and for that purpose being, I see no reason why anyone shouldn't watch this film."
" Uninteresting.
",2019-01-23 00:00:00,1,"I understood the ""comedic"" satiric on relationships and the human condition and so on, but, like all the film that I happen to discover have been directed by Yorgos Lanthimos it just wasn't interesting. It felt like you were being subjected to someone's, presumably the director's, personal piece of ideology, maybe based on his angsty diary entries was being shoved in the everyone's faces. Okay, maybe I'm not being totally serious, but, point is, the film is a bit like the stereotypical experimental film a college student would churn out for their latest project they've been assigned by some pretentious, overbearing art teacher."
" I've lost 2 hours of my life !!
",2019-01-23 00:00:00,1,"The rating and the trailer were actually dishonest. I found the movie boring, depressing and tastless. I get the idea behind it, but its execution could have been much better and in a creative way.
I regret the time I spent watching this movie until the end, hoping somthing interisting would happen or that it would get better in the end.
I don't understand how Rachel and Colin agreed on this absurdity."
" Not my cup of tea
",2019-01-23 00:00:00,4,"I like movies with characters I can relate to, with suspense, some action, and an interesting plot.
This movie doesn't meet any of those criteria. The characters are unrelatable, the plot is absurd satire, there's some gore and distasteful sexual activity, and once you get the plot device, it becomes pointless. It's true it has dark humor and satire, which I don't find appealing. I will stick to more conventional films."
" Takes bad movies to a whole new level of hell.
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,1,"I'm not sure what to say...this is the worse drivel I've seen in a long time, right there at the bottom with Caligula. Hell, I'd watch Vegas in Space again just to get the time I wasted waiting for something redeeming to come of this...but no, I wasn't even granted the slightest value or closure even at the end.I'm reading all the 1-2 star reviews to help justify my feelings for this so-called 'movie' and why my spouse and I just wasted two damn hours of our lives. I like dark, dystopian future stories and enjoy slogging through most to see what the writer/director has to offer in the end. But this, couldn't even deliver an ending with that.Take warning and take heed...know you'll likely be angry and upset with yourself if you decide to watch this."
" It gets better
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,7,"I turned the film off halfway through. It seemed like it might be one of the worst films I've ever seen. Luckily, right before I turned it off, it started to get a tad bit better, which led me interested enough to watch the rest later. Halfway through, the nonsensical craziness seems to show its point.While some of this film is off-putting, some people will really enjoy this. Just don't give up on it. It gets more interesting and understandable deeper into the film.Not really my style of film overall. But I was pleasantly surprised how much I ended up enjoying, especially considering the fact that I utterly hated the first part."
" I Guess You Could Call it a Rom-Com
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,8,"When I look to watch a movie, the first thing I look for is a creative idea executed well to make the movie memorable and unique; and Yorgos Lanthimos delivers excellently with his 2015 film, The Lobster. This movie fits its absurdist style absolutely and asserts that relationships can be shallow and driven by our necessity to not be alone.
The general plot of this movie starts by introducing that in this world, Newly divorced David must find a wife within 45 days or face the fate of getting turned into an animal of his choice, to which he chooses a lobster based on its longevity and his fondness for the sea. To complete this impossible mission, all single people are relocated into a bleak and propagandist hotel designed to force singles into couples to conform to society. Lanthimos uses this outlandish setting to present the weak connections behind many relationships.
Lanthimos masterfully characterizes very minimally while filming in an intentionally mundane way. Lines are read choppily and shots are long with little background sound or action. But the first time watching, I could barely look away based on the sheer absurdity of the style and premise of this movie in addition to some hilarious lines and situations that arise out of the awkwardness. In a bold move by lanthimos, he chooses to not give name to any of the other characters, instead describing them by one major characteristic such as the girl who gets frequent nose bleeds, the man with the limp, the man with the lisp, or the cruel woman. The bored disengaged filming style and its creative characterization shattered every expectation that I had that one could do with a movie and kept me hooked throughout the film.
The Lobster fits very similarly to what Lanthimos has done in the past with his movie Dogtooth. In that movie the main characters are also not given names and they are confined to their house under their overprotective parents similarly to how David is confined to the relational pressure to find a companion that manifests itself in the ultimatum enforced by the blank conformity of the hotel.
Lanthimos' directing style contrasts in almost every way to what Anthony and Joe Russo did with Avengers Infinity War. The Russo brothers used every scene and a complex plot filled with colorful scenery, quick cuts, and near constant action to create an energetic movie. Lanthimos did almost everything differently and still created an interesting movie, showcasing his ability to do everything differently from a traditional Hollywood movie and it still create a success.
I have two complaints with this movie, one being the score and the other being the length of the second half of the film. The score of the movie is the same song that repeats throughout the movie, and it often feels overused. My other complaint is that certain scenes in the letter half of the movie feel long and unnecessary. There is one scene where David and the short sighted woman are walking into town. In this particular scene, the uncompromising nature of the style of the film backfires with a long dialogue less walking scene in a second half that doesn't need to be as long as it is.
Contrarily, the theme continues strongly into the second half. David, running out of time, escapes the hotel and joins the group of loners who view relationships in the opposite way. This group faces mutilation if caught with a companion. Lanthimos uses this group to flesh out the opposite end of the spectrum and hypocritical nature of how society views relationships. Lanthimos claims that society penalizes both being happily single and being in a relationship.
The true strength of this film is demonstrated in its unique setting and the style in which it is filmed. This movie stuck firmly in my memory because it is truly like nothing I have ever seen before and that is what makes it great. The film style, with its gray and muted colors creates a movie that is ironically unforgettable.
In addition to being a unique movie, this movie stays strong to its theme and provides a strong commentary on what relationships may become in the future. I will concede that this movie is not for everyone, but I will recommend it to anyone who appreciates seeing a fresh perspective taking to movie making. I'm giving The Lobster a 4/5 and I will definitely rewatch in the near future."
" Should've been a black mirror episode

" Boring, Absurd and not funny.
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,2,"Basically the title, the good reviews have a point. it does have something to say about trying to fit in, about rebels being as extreme as authority, about the extremes and the open ending.but to be quite honest this is really more of a consolation for watching the movie than anything. the 2 hours of this movie were boring, dull and not funny. the movie is interesting but certainly not recommended, and is not worth the time."
" Instant depression
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,1,"If you want to waste time looking at people without emotion, doing unpleasant things. There is nothing to relate to. That is the concept of the movie but a visit to the dentist is nicer.
The romance woven in, is too flimsy to enjoy it. Some people claim there is absurd humor in this movie: if you think this is humor then remind me not to hang out with you ever."

Must C!"
" How did this miss?!
",2019-01-09 00:00:00,3,"Dystopian future film by the man who brought us Dogtooth and The Killing of a Sacred Deer. A story and narrative structure that defies genre classification. Colin Farrell looking like Bizzaro World Colin Farrell. A slightly-unsettling, detached narration to match the slightly-unsettling, detached acting. A bold, satirical take on relationships. People turning into animals. John C. Reilly.These are all great reasons to love- or want to love- The Lobster. Unfortunately, all of those ingredients turned into an endlessly horrible slog that felt an hour longer than its running time. If your movie defies classification because it's like nothing anyone's ever seen before, that's fantastic. If your movie defies classification because it's too depressing to be a comedy, too cynical to be a romance, too absurd to be a drama, and too dull to be a thriller, you haven't broken ground. You've just made a movie that's bad in lots of different ways."
" Liked by the critics
",2019-01-08 00:00:00,9,"I understand why a lot of people had problems with this film, and why, for the most part, the critics did not. Personally, I loved it. As a film student, I'm used to putting my 'critic-head' on, but I get that 'The Lobster's bizarreness and unfamiliarity might make some viewers lose interest. I won't lie, its quite a rough watch.One thing I do wish to comment on is the ending, so if you haven't seen this film yet, stop reading now. So at the end, we are left with a blind Rachel Weisz sitting alone in a cafe, and a short-sighted Colin Farrell with a knife to his face in the next room, ready to blind himself (we assume this is the plan he describes to Weisz in their secret code). The screen cuts to black and we are given the cliffhanger to end all cliffhangers. Farrell himself said there were three possible outcomes:1. David blinds himself and the two live on as a couple.
2. David runs away, leaving a handicapped Rachel Weisz abandoned.
3. David pretends he has blinded himself for the rest of the couple's lives, but in reality, keeps his sight.When watching, I originally assumed he would pick the last option, and we would see him saunter back to his seat, maybe knocking over a glass on the way to make it seem more believable. But as soon as the screen went black, I changed my mind. My instant thought was that the jarring cut was representative of the moment David stabbed himself in the eye, and the film ends here as there is nothing left to see. Whatever the ending is supposed to be, I liked it.Although we know that this is where it ends, earlier in the film, I assumed there would be a different ending. When he uses code to tell Weisz his plan, I assumed he was planning to return to the hotel to transform into a guide dog for her. This is for a few reasons. Firstly, the leader of the single people told her to find herself a guide dog. Also, David's brother was a dog, showing the people are possibly still self-aware after turning into animals. At the start of the film, the hotel manager (Olivia Colman) praises David's choice of a lobster because most people think of 'dog' which is apparently a bad choice?? This is the main reason why I thought he would transform, as it would suggest he had overcome the selfishness of this new regime, and made a decision purely based on love. His actual decision (to blind himself) was only made to fit into the idea that you must have something in common with your partner (short-sightedness, nose bleeds etc.), giving the film a very disturbing and unsettling ending to force you into contemplating modern relationship expectations.These are just some thoughts I had while watching. Let me know what you think. :)"

" Perfect
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,10,"Amazing metaphor.
It draws parallels between the absurdity of the arbitrary relationship norms and rules that exist in its world and our world. It asks bigger philosophical questions about the nature of relationships: what love actually is, what marriage actually means, what it means to be free (he was neither free being forced to be in a couple, nor was he free as a 'loner' - both sides were equally oppressive) - this begs the question of why we have to be in conventional relationships and not acknowledge changes in relationships. It sheds light on the very black and white nature of society's expectations.
He remarks in the first half something about ""is it easier to pretend you dont care when you do, than to pretend that you care when you dont"".
I thought it was interesting that in the whole movie there was a strong theme of lack of loyalty. Most interestingly, rachel (1) tells the loner leader that they could have blinded him instead of her and (2) at the end she lies to him about it heightening your senses in an attempt to make him do it - and when he responds ""i know"" (he has seen her mistake a tennis ball for a kiwi fruit) i think he sort of realises the flawed nature of their relationship - the only relationship in the movie that was momentarily real.
In the end, i think she doesnt want to be blind and alone and turned into an animal, and it begs the question that if she really loved him, would she want him to cut out his eyes? I think the answer is no.
This movie will annoy you if you need a resolution, as this is more of a fascinating exploration of this fictional world."
" Interesting To A Point
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,6,"I'm not familiar with the director's other works but based on a solid cast and some good reviews I thought I'd give The Lobster a look. It definitely starts off strong and once the premise was revealed I was very curious to see how it would further develop. It certainly looks good and is visually attractive and interesting. The performance are all solid as well. The manner in which the film spoofs, satirizes, and questions modern relationships and our increasingly technical/machine/impersonal modes of communication was often times funny and thought-provoking. However, after about a third of the way into this story, I found it to grow a little thin and beginning to lose focus. It never really regained its sure footing and ends with more of a whimper than a bang."
" No laughs here.
",2018-12-30 00:00:00,1,"Dark comedy? It's dark in a gray, pointless way but it's definitely not comedy. I didn't laugh once, or even come close. Pointless is the only word I can think of for this grim attempt at a story."
" Warped, Dark, Sadistic and Deadpan Funny
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,9,"If your sense of humor can be a bit morbid, this one is well worth the viewing. Uniquely silly and smart at the same time. Deadpan delivery. Absurd ideas. Not for the faint of heart, nor those who crave a more formulaic story composition. Some quoteworthy lines and memorable scenes."
" Film Noir Light
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,9,"Not for the folks who need movies spoon-fed to them. The jock/cheerleader types will find it dull.
But if you like your film noir a bit more easy to digest (like me) this flick will keep your brain occupied for days.
Collin Farrell is almost unnocitable. It may be his best work.
There are no amazing sets, no spectacular scenery, no stand out performances.
Everyone and every thing is swallowed by the story entirely.
The dialogue is uneasy, terse, and blunt.
All the while there is a sense of unease, awkwardness, and stifled tension.
My favorite movie of 2018, and the kind that has to be made every couple of years by Hollywood.
This absolves them of the tripe they feed us the other 99.9% of the time."
" Lanthimos' Best Film To Date
",2018-12-21 00:00:00,8,"This is a most unique feature, brimming with wonderful direction, cinematography, screenplay and performances. A showcase of Yorgos Lanthimos' unique method.There is much to praise, first and foremost comes the screenplay and direction from of which the rest of the glory comes from. Yorgos Lanthimos delivers what can only be described as absurd, but truly never feels 'cringed' or forced. This film has incredible tonal consistency, and its entire band of emotion is delivered to perfection. The dialogue within is very unique, every character feels awkward within their own skin, and highly intriguing dynamics then play out. Yet it doesn't feel bad, it is silly, but works extremely well. Once again Lanthimos delivers the best from his actors, none of the performances fall on the weak side, and with so many talents here and so many differing angles of character and the variety of emotion, it is truly a wonder that they all came out to the quality in which they did. The comedy feels mischievous and yet some may call it distasteful, I believe it compliments and feed the tone of the feature. As a matter of fact, I was so enthralled by the comedic elements that I had started coughing on three separate occasions during the feature, it truly is a funny experience, yet is deadpan but not boring. It doesn't run out of steam, it flows at a steady pace.The cinematography of this film is stellar, having read into it, it turns out this film was not shot on film (Due to no labs being present in Ireland), and thus they used a very specific combination of lenses to deliver a grained, classical and vibrant look. The colours are very deep, it feels not 'vibrant' in the sense of an explosion of colour, bit vibrant in its depth, it feels real, the colours contrast and match in all the right places. In addition to this, most of the feature was shot under natural light, this compliments the tone of the film in a most unexpected way. It feels more raw, and has greater depth in all the right places. In addition to this, The way in which Yorgos Lanthimos and Thimios Bakatakis have created the angles used in the feature is truly unique, they repeat the same angle when in the same place, indicating the monotony of the characters lives. The angles are highly creative, creating a unique image, when in tandem with the colouration, it truly has a unique picture quality and perspective.Another great strength of this feature is its performances, first is Colin Farrell as David. For the longest time I didn't like Colin Farrell as an actor, but this has truly changed my opinion of him. His performance as the silently heartbroken, yet pragmatic and funny David is really magnetic. He doesn't hold back in any aspects, yet the performance is not over the top, it is subdued where it has to be and is highly enthralling and entertaining to watch. Seeing him step out of the usual drunk irishman role, and into something highly unique and so successful was a delight.The rest of the cast is also wonderful. Ben Whishaw as John was great to see, along with John C Riley, they give David some backbone in the first half and help to prop up his character which is rather quiet in the first half. Léa Seydoux as the loner leader was great, she appears in far too few roles, and delivered the slightly deranged and power crazed leader very well. A great antagonist who yet the main character rely on. Ariane Labed as the Maid and Angeliki Papoulia as Heartless Woman were both great, seeing them in another Lanthimos movie was fantastic and here they play upon their characteristic strengths of strange, somewhat evil and some might say cruel ladies within the narrative. They also deliver some of the comedic highlights of the film which one must only see to truly understand. Olivia Colman was as wonderful as ever, the sadistic yet friendly hotel manager is truly what begins the absurdity of the feature was was delivered extremely well by Colman.Rachel Weisz as the shortsighted woman who falls in love with David was a great presence. She narrates the majority of the feature, though we do not first encounter her in physical from until much later into the film. She was masterfully performed, her and Colin Farrell were well matched, and her witty and obtuse character was really a needed balance to Farrell's character.On the other hand, I did feel that in some parts the film dragged on a little too far. For instance the comedy sometimes went on a little too long, however I understand Lanthimos' decision to portray it in this way, its meant to be awkward and strange. Yet in some parts I understood this and yet I felt it went on a little too far. In addition to this, most of the film is devoid of music, while I also understand this decision, I felt as of it was somewhat lacking in some areas, although this did not impede upon my enjoyment of the feature.In the end, this is a truly great film. One of the ultimate, if not perhaps the, blend of comedy, absurdism and dystopia. Yorgos Lanthimos has done it again and is truly writing his name as one of the best filmmakers currently working, due to his masterful way of constructing a film from all aspects, most notably acting, cinematography, direction and screenwriting which are all distinct and unique to his own expression. 8/10"
" There is no deeper meaning to any of this
",2018-12-20 00:00:00,2,I think the script may have been written as a joke. There is more profound wisdom in a Trump tweet. If there was a point it could have been made in 30 seconds. Watch it if you feel the act of watching will make you seem more interesting.
" Depends on what you like
",2018-12-20 00:00:00,7,"One of the few movies I could see a dramatic difference of opinions being accurate. If you are drawn to dystopian future states or alternate realities and dark comedies that are dramatically off center and slow moving, this is for you. If not, don't waste your time."
" Random, dark story that changes its tone halfway through
",2018-12-19 00:00:00,7,"""The Lobster"" is quite a unique experience. It's a story about a man in the near future in a hotel that's designed to help single people find a mate, or be turned into an animal if one fails to do so. It's a tale of loneliness, love, and transformation. The deadpan nature of the actors and environment mixed with the grim, silly humor makes me feel like this film would be the result if the boys from Monty Python tried making a serious movie. The characters are mostly apathetic, as it seems those in charge in the future wants everybody to lack emotion, which sort of adds to the hilarity. It's a weird movie, but I enjoyed it. Although I feel like I would've enjoyed it more while drunk. It starts off well and rather funny, but it gets more serious as it goes on, and sort of loses its charm a bit. A film such as this that starts off dark and humorous but loses its humor towards the end, just becomes dark and depressing. However it is still an enjoyable flick, worth seeing.What really got me laughing, were the absurd attempts by the establishment to stress that being part of a couple is better than being single. No spoilers here, but in particular as an example, is what the dart-shooting instructor says to the man from room 187, as he calls him up to take his turn. This is just one example of many. The comedy is emotionless, blunt, bleak, and seems to mirror the lives of those in reality who struggle to find a partner.There are obvious social commentaries in the film, driving home messages of loneliness, relationships (especially ones that are forced, either from within oneself, or by an outside force), and government's forcefulness and knack for butting in where it's not wanted. You can take it more seriously like this, pretend that the film has a point. Or you can just go along for the random, ridiculous ride.
Just be prepared for it to be a different movie at the end than how it starts.If you liked this (or you haven't seen it yet but have enjoyed some of the following), I will recommend a few films/tv shows. There's a movie that is even more random than this one called ""Rubber,"" about a killer telekinetic tire. Hilarious, and quite misunderstood. There's also ""Black Mirror,"" an excellent show on the nature of society and technology, ""The Lobster"" seems to me to be a similar in terms of social criticism in the future. Then there's ""In Bruges,"" a hidden gem also starring Colin Farrell. There is also ""Withnail & I,"" ""Equilibrium,"" ""Harold & Maude,"" and ""Barton Fink."""

Yeah, it's a social commentary, but I am not sure what it's trying to comment on, except to exhort people to stop living by other people's rules.Everyone is remarkably stupid. The women seem to refuse possible matches, and are also refused, and thus are turned into animals. Unless the point is that they are already animals, in how they behave in this system. Very little humanity is expressed so......Definitely worth the watch, just to see the weirdness of it all. Fair warning It is is dark, depressing, and morbid."

" Super Disappointing. Pointless and absurd take on an alternate society
",2018-12-17 00:00:00,3,"From the other reviews I expected something fresh, different, clever and insightful. What I got was something different but different but that's all. The movie posits a world organized to promote couples but populated by idiots. By age 40 you must be coupled and apparently it matters not if you had been coupled but no longer are, all that matters is whether you are coupled AT 40. From that follows the setup and setting of the movie, a hotel where you have a month to find your matched partner or else you suffer the penalty.This absurd world is, for some unfathomable reason, tolerated by the inhabitants. Well, there is a reason of sorts I suppose, it's because these are no ordinary inhabitants, no, the inhabitants are a cross between the Stepford descendants and barely functional morons. We are to believe people meekly line up for their ""stay"" at the hotel, question almost nothing and if they do escape go on to be just as foolish and meek and stupid in their new environment.The acting is wooden but that is on purpose and in keeping with what apparently was the vision for this movie, a world full of wooden idiots meekly and blindly accepting their fate. Oh how clever..I might accept that premise if it was not taking place in the bigger setting of our current world with cars and well engineered highways, etc, etc. But it is just not believable that a world of people as meek and stupid and compliant and almost utterly lacking in self-awareness would have the smarts to create our current world yet be such moronic idiots by the age of 40. The movie Idiocracy seems far more realistic an alternative world than this waste of almost 2 hours.I gave it a 3 instead of a 1 because it's somewhat more engrossing than Plan 9 From Outer Space."
" I know it's ""trending"" on Netflix but DON'T DO IT
",2018-12-17 00:00:00,2,"The concept of a dystopian world where so-called ""loners"" (single people) must find a mate within 45 days or be transformed into an animal of their choice sounds like a concept for a dark rom-com. If you're expecting a humorous dystopian drama such as ""Warm Bodies,"" this is NOT IT. The movie becomes increasingly bizarre as it progresses, and it utterly unenjoyable. Save yourself a couple hours and read the synopsis if you're really that curious about the plot of the movie. There is not a single relatable or loveable character, nor is there a redeeming plot to the film. This movie is depressing, dark, and strange. You're not bored enough to watch this movie - this is scraping the bottom of the barrel, just DON'T."

" Stupid Premise
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,1,"If you were under a deadline to either find a mate or be turned into an animal, you'd find a partner right freakin' quick.Am I supposed to believe a cute young blonde can't find a boyfriend on a moment's notice, never mind 45 days or whatever it is?
Cripes, for most of the history of the world and for half the world still, marriages are arranged. Am I supposed to believe everbody is so miserable about their quickie relationships?
The inert acting (score another bad performance by Colin Farrell). The depressing quartet soundtrack. The unbelievable premise. The dark colours.
Horrible.
I'd have walked out of the theatre. Luckily I was watching for free on TV and was able to change the channel."
" Disturbing - please be aware before watching
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,2,"I wish I had read the reviews before watching it on Netflix. I kept watching The Lobster in hope that it would get better. There was no explanation of the plot of the movie - single people are sent to a hotel for 45 days to find a mate or are banished to the wilderness as an animal. It has so much animal and human cruelty in it. Plus, thr movie makes no sense. There are so many inconsistencies and unexplained things that it'll drive you crazy. The only other movie that bothered me this much was Freddie Got Fingered. Enough said."
" Horrible
",2018-12-13 00:00:00,1,I stopped watching this one long before I even stopped watching Tusk! Both are horrible movies!
" Speechless...
",2018-12-13 00:00:00,8,"I watched this two-hour movie without pause, as hypnotized, and when it ended I was left staring at the ending credits and then the black screen for a few more minutes. I had no idea what to write, so I went to see what others have commented. Rare are films that divide the audience like this. There are no middle grades, I didn't see any fives, sixes or sevens. All the reviews I saw either spit on it, rating it one or two, or praise it and give it nines and tens. I think it is both an exaggeration, but one thing is certain - the film achieved the goal that is shared by all the movies, and that is to make a strong impression.In the dystopian future, it is not allowed to be single. Singles are arrested and taken into a remote hotel, where they have 45 days to pair up or otherwise they'll be transformed into an animal of their own choice. A lot of them escape to the nearby forest and the hotel residents hunt them and for every one caught hunter gets an extra day at the hotel. The film shows both sides of the coin, life in the hotel and life in the forest. It is totally weird, irrational, morbid and mesmerizingly disturbing, yet again, it's not tiring to watch. The cast is very good and Yorgos Lanthimos definitely hooked me to see the rest of his movies.8/10In case you didn't notice, except for the main character and his two ""best friends"", there are no names mentioned in the entire movie. Even the names of the two leading female characters are left unknown."
" Interesting Movie
",2018-12-12 00:00:00,5,"This was a very interesting movie because I do not recall seeing anything quite like it. The idea that people would be turned into animals for failing to find partners is as original as it is absurd. There is simply no reason for any society t be set up this way. If anything, due to the treat of overpopulation, people in a society would be more likely be encouraged to be loners. Even in a society where there not enough kids, people would not need to have partners or be couples to procreate. The movie simply makes no sense whatsoever but somehow I kept watching it to the very end. So,obviously the people who made it did something right. However, the ending was so insane I had to deduct a lot of points for that. They had hardly nothing in common before she was blinded but they clicked as a couple. Plus, their clicking as a couple had nothing to do with them both not being able to see well. After all, they relied on their vision to communicate without words. Shared poor vision was not essential to their relationship. So, it made no sense for him to blind himself because she was blind. It especially made no sense for him to stab himself in the eyes with a steak knife when he could have had the same doctor who blinded his woman blind him. Hell, he probably would have felt obligated to do it free of charge. Also, I feel the movie dragged on too long. Nevertheless, it was interesting, and hence my rating."

" Goes from interesting to boring to mind numbing
",2018-12-09 00:00:00,3,"On the first 45 minutes or so very interesting. There were bits of humor where I laughed and the premise made me want to see what happened next. Once he got to the forest area, the pace really dropped off and the movie became fairly dull. I found myself watching my phone to pass the time as the movie pondered on. For the last 30 minutes or so I simply skipped ahead on Netflix because it was so completely mind-numbingly slow and there was so little that really happened. I just skipped to the relevant sections. This movie would have been much better as a 1 hour movie, but at 2 hours it's simply too long and too boring. It's what some people want to think of as a highbrow humor movie when really it's just a boring movie."

This movie really went for some shock value, and in its own way tried to be artsy, but ended up being dull, depressing, ridiculous and numbing. I had no energy by the end of the film and was just kind of drowsy and a little depressed. I think it actually could have MAYBE been something if the characters wouldn't have all been really stupid and unlikeable and monotone. Sad, because in some weird and eclectic way this maybe could have been an interesting movie...."
" An autistic look at love and society's expectations
",2018-12-03 00:00:00,7,"An outrageous, simple, horrifying, captivating, and nuanced-yet-not film.It plays out like a world full of autistic people. Simple and awkward conversations, which are more statements and no frills. Poorly expressed and understood emotions. Discomfort and difficulty in unexpected and changing situations.It feels kind of like a play, but I guess the robotic behaviour and acting is part of the black and white world presented and how humans behave and think.The arbitrary and objective treatment of others and of relationships. A utilitarian approach to coupling (which seems odd because children are 'assigned' to couples, one wonders how procreation happens and why there are spare children around). Woeful misunderstanding of the nuance of real relationships and utilitarianism... but it provides a ridiculous look into the isolation of life and the pursuit of relationships to provide a reason for being.This really was not worthy of such low ratings by some reviewers, but it is definitely not an 'easy' film to watch, because the behaviour of the characters is very stiff and forced...If anything, I think this film is more of a serious look at autistic thinking and behaviour, than of humanity's pursuit of coupling relationships and a 'cost benefit'/utilitarian analysis of actions.This film will leave you with more to think about than to feel about. It's difficult to empathise with such robotic characters, but I think instead it requires a deeper understanding and appreciation of these people and the world they live in to really try to react appropriately...Do I feel sorry for these people, or pleased that life is so simplistic? Some of these single people actually look forward to their lives as transformed animals. The certainty of expectations and the simplicity of relationships must be comforting for them, eg: do we both have a limp, or do we both have similar hair?I think this film is excellent, whatever the case. It is extremely novel, by premise and delivery, and really gave me a lot to think about. The locations and sets/props were used very well and felt right for this film. There are some horrifying elements to the film, but it is not meant to be gory (save for a few scenes that show blood and/or death (human and animal), but not extreme in delivery) or frightening.Violence was used well, with restraint, and I think presented the story well and added a lot.Watch this film, and push through the almost theatrical acting. I believe you will be rewarded by your experience."
" Eye for an Eye
",2018-12-02 00:00:00,7,"""The Lobster"" is certainly an off-beat dark comedy and satire. The dystopian depiction of state-enforced couplings and the equally rigid renegade singles is rather simplistic, but the absurdity of it all is quite amusing. In it, those not already bonded to a romantic partner are forced to check into a hotel with other singles, whereupon they have 45 days to pair up or be surgically transformed into the lower animal of their choice (hence the title). Indeed, David (Colin Farrell) brings his brother, who is now a dog, along with him. Hotel guests--or, rather, inmates--also have the chance to extend their stays by slaying the renegade singles, who like other ""uncivilized"" animals inhabit the woods. To encourage the marriages, the hotel performs parables on a stage for the guests (a woman saving a man from choking at dinner, and the man protecting the woman from being raped on a walk) and enforce symbolic punishments (on the first day, inmates have one arm tied behind their backs). Punishments for other offenses, along with those applied by the loners in the forest, have the flare of the Code of Hammurabi or Biblical laws of retaliation. A man who masturbates--a decidedly singular act--in the hotel has the masturbatory hand burned in a toaster. Likewise, acts requiring a partner are similarly punished by the loners, whereas masturbation is accepted.""The Lobster"" is most amusing while occupying the hotel; whereas, it threatens to derail into a self-contradictory celebration of coupling in the woods when David meets Rachel Weisz's character, who up until then had been providing monotone narration. Their shared short-sightedness (note the use of this term instead of ""near-sighted"") marks them to be together, just as one's defining characteristic--in a society that reduces one to be identified by their limp, nose bleeds, lisps, sociopathy or what have you--required one to find a mate with the same trait at the hotel. Fortunately, however, writer-director Yorgos Lanthimos and company don't settle for such a cop out of affirming the state-repressed individuality in rom-com banality. The acting remains intentionally stilted and the characters entirely unsophisticated. As the pun with the main couple's sight underscores, this is a world where an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind."
" A Satirical Critique of Relationships
",2018-11-26 00:00:00,8,"In a society where single people will be sent to a facility to be transformed into an animal unless they are able to find a mate within 45 days the stakes are high. Much higher than they would be if it were our society where people merely feel ostracized when they are incapable of fulfilling one of the most basic of human expectations.Yes, 'The Lobster' serves as a satirical critique of relationships and social acceptance. When someone, is caught masturbating when he should be up and about searching for a woman he is punished. The audience can easily sympathize, for who hasn't felt a bit of guilt after a good old yanking session? There are other weird practices like a maid coming to give you slightest of sexual pleasures, just enough to leave you wanting more.Another way this film criticizes relationships is the way many of its characters choose to pretend to have things in common, to base their relationship on a lie, rather than turning to the only other options which are to stay alone and either be turned into an animal or run off into the woods where the 'loners' retreat. The loners are as the name implies, alone. Not only that, but they live by rules equally as strict as those in the facility. Only here, no one is allowed to have a significant other.There are clearly loners who want nothing more than to be with someone, but just like the outside world, they must follow the rules or risk the wrath other people will unleash upon them. However, there are those that will break these social contracts and strive for what they truly want."
" Awful

" Film Liquet on The Lobster
",2018-11-07 00:00:00,7,"Made by the Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos, there is no wonder that ""The Lobster"" makes you feel completely uncomfortable and uneasy, showing off the director's script writing techniques and unique style. The plot centres around a dystopian future, where single people are placed in a hotel and given 45 days to find a romantic partner or otherwise they will be turned into animals. Starring Colin Farrell as a newly single man trying to find a partner in order to remain human, after failing to do so, he decides to flee and become a loner - who the people in the hotel hunt, which extends their stay in the hotel.With an absurd fictional storyline, the film delivers an interesting premise, criticizing the ridiculousness of forcing someone to fall in love due to common interests, or forcing someone to get married, being a common practice. Commenting on the social pressure that is put on the adults, along with the notion of putting people into boxing, not allowing bi-s well as not allowing shoes that are between sizes.I am not a fan of the director's works; however, I try to remain unbiased when judging the work. The content along with the plot of the movie throws a lot of people off because of the ridiculous concepts, however it is in that ridicule that the director exposes the real life flaws of different cultures and social activities, such as critiques of marriage. The film is shot with a lot of thought put into it, the shots are well framed and show off the breath-taking locations of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Collin Farrell and Rachel Weisz, along with the other cast members add to the film greatly."

In said hotel you have 45 days to meet your ideal partner with whom you must share at least one given characteristic. If you fail to meet partner you are turned into an animal of your choosing (hence lobster). What's not to like? A fantastically bonkers and laugh out loud 8 out of ten.

",2018-10-08 00:00:00,1,"First off let me say the trailer doesn't reflect the reality - while it gives you a feeling that it's going to be humorous, the movie is rather dark, dull and boring. What the trailer specifically doesn't show are the extremely disturbing and gore scenes, which are plenty. Movie is being tagged as comedy and romance and I've hardly seen that. I had a hard time finding the alternative reality believable and I didn't feel anything for the characters, which is a bad sign. This movie felt like a student film but unnecessarily long."
" Insanely Prolific
",2018-10-02 00:00:00,10,"There's nothing out there quite like The Lobster. Yorgos Lanthimos has invented something harshly relevant to a society eminently apparent of now and till the future. I abhor the fact that a majority of audiences unquestionably missed the mark on what this movie meant. To me, not only is Lanthimos take on society's perception of love darkly and satirically delightful to watch, but also, culturally relevant to what today's standards in terms of building a relationship are. This is How I Perceive the 1st Half: With the uprise of social media-an undoubtably other circumstances-love and romance has been in demand at higher levels than it has ever been. Marriage has been worshiped as such a ""positive"" norm in society, that people continuously are feeling more and more pressured into finding a partner, no matter the odds. Socialization has caused us to become ignorant of love's meaning/ purpose, and more focused on the selfish endeavor of finding a way to fit into our now devious world through progressive appearances. This is How I Perceive the 2nd Half: ""Specific"" societies often deny people who have ""taboo"" (according to their norms) relationships from continuing their accords by punishing them through severe practices, simply because ""taboo"" occurances don't follow their general beliefs. Their are countless examples of what is considered a ""taboo"" form of love within many societies (different sexualities, different nationalities, different personalities, different social statuses, etcetera). Adversaries are always trying to shut you down when the one good thing in your life finally comes into play-relatable. I'm assuming Lanthimos is modestly saying, ""Hey people need to mind their own freakin' business and let folks love who they want to love. As long as it's real, who gives a damn.""This is How I Perceive the Ending: ""Oh, the crazy things people will do when they're in love.""So...yeah. The Lobster is probably the most informal love aphorism of the 21st Century. Go figure. Yorgos has the most f***** up vision in Hollywood right now, but that's exactly why we need him. This wickedness he constantly froths into his filmography is awfully necessary in order to get timely, critical, and imperative messages-like this-out into such a flawed province (society). The more I watch The Lobster the more poetic, shocking, outlandish, traumatic, disturbing, sinister, and umm...funnier it becomes. Don't be ignorant fellas, please, look at this film as a MOMENTOUS learning lesson. Embrace the eccentricity, as they say. (Verdict: A)"
" Just bad. Plain and simple.
",2018-10-01 00:00:00,1,"I know what the director was trying to do, but to me it seemed like he could've done anything with this movie and people still would've put it on a piedestal. Stop kidding yourselves, this movie was long and hard to watch, and not because of the theme or message, but because it was so badly put together. I did like some characters and chuckled on some scenes, but it was really nothing extraordinary. This could easily have been an episode in the Black Mirror series, with a shorter runtime and less artsy dialog and better character development.Skip this one."
" reminds me of the late 50s/early 60s Theatre of the Absurd
",2018-09-28 00:00:00,7,"The film is convincing in the sense that the director has the actors, particularly Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz, give completely believable performances, directly in the face of reality. Everything rolls along with its own logical progression but all is nonsense. This reminds me of the late 50s/early 60s Theatre of the Absurd, spine tinglingly confrontational plays that might have triggered some base connection with long distant animal past but looked crazy. There may even be a nod to Ionesco's 1959 play Rhinoceros in The Lobster. Dogtooth (2009) was difficult to watch because it was so disturbing and understandable, whilst remaining horrific. Here, particularly when we go out into the woods and real connection with reality seems diminished and it becomes too hard to relate to the terrible goings on. Assured direction but ultimately uninvolving."

Also Colin Farrell did stunning job as David."
" What does it mean?
",2018-08-27 00:00:00,4,"In The City you have to find a partner before you get too old. If you don't, you get sent to The Hotel, where you have only forty-five days to do so before you get turned into an animal. It is suggested to look for someone in The Hotel that you have at least something in common with. No matter how minor that something is. Do you both perhaps suffer from the same physical ailment? Perfect! More than enough ground to build a relationship upon. Right?The Lobster is very much an art film. The premise is highly symbolic, is not even meant to be logical and realistic, and plays on your emotions more than your common sense. And it is told in such a way that it's clear that there's something behind all the nonsense to get, if you know what I mean.I sure did not get whatever that something was, to be sure. The obvious parallels with societal pressure to find a partner, the fear of spinsterhood, the physiological urge to mate and so on, are of course blindingly obvious, but it's the add-ons that baffle me. Like the whole 'get turned into an animal' thing. Does the film try to claim that beyond certain age you cannot find a partner? Probably not, but then why such a final solution. If it was meant to convey that society believes you incapable of finding a partner beyond certain age, why not a death penalty?The whole film is very much like that. Clear goals and basic messages conveyed through muddled metaphors, odd symbolic language and a plot so stilted and woodenly acted that it had to be intentional, for whatever reason.Still, it is very professional on the technical level, the actors are trying their best and some of the metaphors are actually really spot on. Whenever the film tries to be a pure satire, it works really well. It's a shame that it seems to think itself above such a pedestrian art form."

" Quick Review
",2018-08-22 00:00:00,10,"""The Lobster"" is a Movie about love and society! Is a dark comedic tragedy made in the context of the Greek Weird Cinematic Wave and it's a masterpiece of the silver screen.
The acting is absolute perfect for what it must be, but the ultimate protagonist here is Lanthimos's mesmerising Original Screenplay. So, If you are willing to Take an obscure view on society and it's basic pieces, this is your movie!"
" What's the point?
",2018-08-21 00:00:00,3,"I'll give you this - the first shot was marvelous, apart from that, there is very little positive I can think of about this film.Reflection of society? Okay... I did not feel that. Yeah: the bad society tries to make all of us the same, and it sometimes feels like there is no groups we can be a part of without suffering the consequences of its limitations. But what I really did not understand was the difference between the forest world and the hotel world, and their connection. Is this supposed to be something like Wuthering Heights? I understand it's supposed to show that there are two opposite worlds but none of them are of any good. However this was expressed so poorly through screenwriting that everything about the film itself felt very artificial. I did not believe the main character or any other characters to be frank.Besides, I don't know what this film was. A comedy, a drama? Not that it was a combination, but more like it was none of those yet thrived to be all..."
" QUIRKY DOESN'T EQUAL GOOD...!
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,6,"This quirky dramedy came from the mind of Yorgos Lanthimos & was nominated for Oscar for original screenplay & originality is to be found in this tale of a man who must find love again in a hotel among the various lovelorn but if a match is not found by a certain time limit, he'll be turned into the animal of the title. I know, it's a grabber. For the most part when the action is confined to the estate, the story works whereby the mechanics of masturbation or nose bleeds yields comedic gold but once our hero, played by Colin Farrell, makes a dash back to the real world, the novelty wears off since the story continues to put arbitrary rules where really there shouldn't be."
" While certainly bold and original, the second half struggles with the more serious emotions
",2018-08-17 00:00:00,6,"The Lobster is a completely absurdist societal commentary on society's emphasis on monogamy and relationships. The first half's humor and exploration of Lanthimos' wildly creative premise is the movie's strength. The functioning of the hotel and how they encourage people to find partners as well as the animal aspect was amusing. The intentional lack of emotion and engagement with others was frustrating to watch - while I appreciate the symbolic nature of it, it took me out of the premise in which partnership was everything because it felt so unrealistic for them to act with no emotion. The second half also didn't feel strong and was less clever and active in plot. A point made repeatedly in the movie was how heavily relationships are based on shared interests or similarities, which just didn't ring very true or relevant to me. Farrell was good, and one of my favorite elements of the film (and a big reason why it's still an overall positive review) was the score - it was dramatic but simple and fit to the scenes very well. The boldness of ideas and themes were fun, but some of the relationship themes didn't quite land with me, and the second half and especially ending were disappointing, especially given the potential of the technical aspects and premise."

",2018-08-08 00:00:00,1,"Nothing happens. The ending is terrible. Wasted time. Really the trailer is all you need, way better than the 2 hrs of waiting for something to happen and nothing does. Don't waste your time. Idk how people can give it a 10, honestly."
" Tedious
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,2,"It's original, I'll give it that. Unfortunately I want more out of a movie than that. John C. Reilly is pretty much totally wasted in this and the movie is really weird just for the sake of being really weird. I hate leaving a theater feeling like my time was deliberately wasted like this."
" Postmodern absurdist garbage that masqerades as ""truth""
",2018-07-25 00:00:00,1,"The Lobster is a revolting, dull and unfunny film that attempts to be funny (in a blatantly ironic & satirical way) by employing deliberately stilted dialogue delivery and awkward scenes that sometimes present outright disgusting cruelty/gore. As the main theme of the film is to make a mockery out of modern human forms of communications & relationships this is understandable, but it falls like a limp, smelly half-dead fish that flops hopelessly on the sand in the hopes of trying to elicit attention from it's audience.The idea that this is a film about the social conformity and the pressures of marriage and monogamous relationships is typical of a postmodern mindset that arrogantly rejects any kind of stability whatsoever. Besides, is this really a critique of the modern world? Is this really a film about how suffocating monogamous relationships are? If so, it seems to be a film about the pressures of the 20th century rather than the 21st since an increasing amount of people live alone than ever. The question is then: Why does The Lobster seek to satirise such a thing? One answer is partly because it is a film devoted to a specifically air-headed sort of person who lives a fairly modest if not boring state of existence, both in their social and ""professional"" lives. Of course, you can debate as much as you want about what ""The Lobster"" is about, which really shows how completely pretentious and, at the same time, vacuous it really is.Of course, all this is seen by people who admire the film as very intelligent and daring because, as well all know, laughing at modern existential suffering of humans in the form of presenting scenes full of crude and violent symbology is apparently hilarious - if you're someone with an anti-social, psychopathic or sociopathic mindset, that is. All the scenes are typical of the symbology of an arm-chair psychologist. It seems to make the overall point that people do irrational things - out of fear of loneliness - to belong in society. It screams out: ""This is what we all do.""Ultimately, it is a film that presents a presumptuous and misanthropic view of ""all"" human beings with the exception of the arrogant admirations of the ""one"" person watching and lapping up the self-indulgent narrative of the film. The fact that this is categorised as ""comedy"" only reflects the overall sadomasochistic nature of The Lobster."
" Hilarious, Strange and Very Creative
",2018-07-21 00:00:00,10,"Very few films really entertain me, but The Lobster delivered so many unexpected laughs. My guess would be that you will enjoy this film if you march to your own tune. The film pokes fun at many of a structured society's rules, systems and expectations. The deadpan delivery was a nice surprise. It was almost as if the actors were acting like the public who are often a bit too rigid and dry for my taste. It is impressive that such a film attracted such a wide range of talented actors. I have to admit that I laughed out loud at several ""inappropriate"" moments. Colin Farrell seemed to be really stretching himself in this role. His performance delighted me as much as when Brad Pitt plays gritty crazy characters in Kalifonia or 12 Monkeys. The reason I appreciate such roles is that they appear, to me, to push an actor's ability to play something quite different than the majority of the roles they are cast in. To me, this demonstrates a higher level of ability. Although the film as a whole was dark and unusual, it certainly held my interest, got me thinking and provided several bursts of laughter. Well done to all who contributed the the creation of this work. You can be sure you have made great art when it evokes such a strong response from the audience."
" Another gem from the great Greek filmmaker
",2018-07-20 00:00:00,9,"This movie is a master class in weird but meaningful film making. Want something fresh and original, weird but highly watchable. Then this is a movie for you."
" One word review: awful
",2018-07-13 00:00:00,1,"The lobster is possibly one of the worst movies ever made.
The characters are thrown in a dystopian world where singles have 45 days to get back on track and find a soul mate or be transformed into animals. And it gets even worse. Inmates at the ""coupling hotel"", which is a mix between a lunatic asylum and the love boat, are forced to hunt each other with anaesthetic darts to prolong their stay at the hotel and get more chances to mate.
Acting is pretty dreadful: Colin Farrel could not act to save his life, and apparently it was an ""artistic"" choice to make all characters behave like lobotomy patients.
The hero does not get a better deal with the revolutionaries, singles that chose to live in the woods, and whose rules are even more stringent.
In the end, if you have to choice between watching ""the lobster"" or doing anything else, including plucking your nose for two hours, please choose the latter."
" Hmmm...
",2018-07-03 00:00:00,1,"I'll just leave my rate here, sitting on my sofa watching the cars passing by my window wondering if this movie was able to make a point or any kind of a point beside. I will not explain anything as the movie did not as well, but I guess those who saw the movie will understand."
" Not my cup of tea...
",2018-06-22 00:00:00,3,"I give this movie a ""I'd watch it for free if I was super bored"" out of 10. (3/10) First off, this was definitely not a movie I would watch again. Just to clarify. I only watched it because someone I care about loves it and I wanted to like it for his sake, but I just couldn't.  If I could overlook the plot and the way I felt about it, I might say its a good movie. Costumes and set design is nice to look at and all, but I couldn't get over how uncomfortable this entire movie made me. The concept is interesting... single people have a certain amount of time to find a suitable partner with whom they have something in common, or else they get turned into an animal of their choosing. I just didn't like the way the story played out or the style of acting. Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz (and every other actor within) play characters who have zero social skills and I just didnt vibe with it, if I'm being honest. It's not a bad movie. But it is most certainly not my cup of tea."
" Some greatness but disappointing in the end
",2018-06-17 00:00:00,5,"In a dystopian society (likely in Ireland or England though the location is unnamed), two groups of radical control freaks battle against each other. One is a law-enforcing hotel compound in a rural area. Its purpose is to convert single people into couplehood. Singles who fail to couple within forty-five days face serious consequences. The other group is loners who have escaped the compound and live with their own rules in a nearby forest. David (Colin Farrell) sees the worst of both worlds.The first half is clever at times despite some moments of cruelty and sadism. As bizarre as the anti-single compound is, it seems to make sense within its own set of rules and ideals. Its concept is likely a stab against one of the unspoken prejudices: the belief that singlehood is an unfortunate and horrible situation that must be corrected and removed as quickly as possible. The oddball group of characters make a fascinating show that sometimes has scary moments. There is also a clever contradiction as the ""guests"" are treated with verbal courtesy even as they are being controlled.The movie goes downhill in the second half once the main action moves into the forest. It's not just overly long (it is); it misses the opportunity to show the misfits living differently from the tyranny they left behind. It's just more of the same controlling mean-spiritedness. By this time one has already had enough and wants less rather than more of what took place before.Even a plot twist fails. There could have been tension and suspense. Instead, it was done so quickly, one wonders why it didn't happen sooner.The characters are deliberately bland and almost robotic thus making it difficult to identify with anyone. When David makes a ridiculous and stupid decision by the end, the feeling of disappointment is further fueled."
" Awesome Movie
",2018-05-30 00:00:00,8,"Acting of all the lead and supporting characters were awesome, every scene and every clip is trying to give the hidden message, Direction is marvellous, Fully captivating."
" Abysmal.
",2018-05-29 00:00:00,1,This movie is embarrassing for the people who have produced it. I can't believe these talented actors were part of this joke.
" Painful to watch
",2018-05-26 00:00:00,1,Don't waste your time with this crap.. it is absurd and slow
" Oh my god
",2018-05-17 00:00:00,1,A waist of my life. I wish I had that hour and 58 minutes back so I could do the dishes and a load of laundry and maybe scrub the toilet. Anything would be better than watching this movie.
" I think I know how this ends... do you agree?
",2018-05-16 00:00:00,8,"Okay, in the forest, she's explaining their conversational body signals... raise this hand and it's ""I love you more than anything"", raise that hand and it's ""we're in danger"", we have to be careful not to mix those two up at first...Then, he's in the bathroom, steading himself...Then, she's thanking the waiter for filling her glass though she's been sitting without touching her glass, so she must have been drinking it over a while...The way she said ""thank you very much"" to the waiter was strange - either she's up set like she was when he hadn't brought her rabbits for a while, or she's thanking the watier not for the first time...I swear, I swear, I think I see some sort of construction vehicle - a front end loader? drive behind her from right to left... and as it goes off camera on the left I swear the driver has his right arm all the way up in the air (palm facing the camera)... which signal was the right arm again??Or I could be imagining the 'arm up' part at the end. You tell me!Either way, I thought this movie was brilliant. And the casting was phenomenal !!"
" A Missed Opportunity
",2018-05-11 00:00:00,6,"Collin Farrell knows exactly how to deliver his lines (with a satisfying native Irish accent) in The Lobster. Writer/Director Ygoros Lanthimos must've been giddy behind the camera, as his world of strangeness and deadpan humor was captured. A very promising future is set for the both of them. (See: The Killing of a Sacred Deer. Also see: my coming critique.) It's very refreshing to get a tone of weird, absurdest humor out of otherwise dull language. The way he writes his dialogue in repetitive, robotic flow makes for an intriguing study of the human condition. This is the movie's strongest aspect. Unfortunately, it becomes exhaustive and stretched well passed its welcoming universe. About the halfway mark, we leave the setting that promised obscure and terrifying things to take place, and instead the writer seems to go out of his way to make a more structured message on love. You will find such a message, but it's beaten and kicked to death, leaving the viewer a bit insulted that no confidence was held in him earlier to find it himself.Strange and uncomfortable movies are what I get most revved up about and this certainly had that charm, albeit for a shorter time than its 2 hour running. What really upsets me and irks is the useless interfacing between pointless characters
and a reaching climax that rehashes themes attempting to really hone in the message. In my opinion, Farrel, the dark hotel of lonliness and the animal conversion machine could have been cultivated toward a truly shocking 
twist and utter devastation that would have shaken the audience. Instead, its interesting rhythm fizzles, and we're left with what feels like a pretentious artist sticking with the flat-line tone he should have shed in the second act."
" One of the worst films ever made
",2018-05-08 00:00:00,2,"The premise of this movie was actually appealing and it seemed to have potential as a quirky satire. However, this movie is so bad in so many ways that I stopped it about halfway through. The writing is confused; the acting is robotic, the humor isn't very funny and the tone is depressing.I have watched and enjoyed numerous futuristic and post apocalyptic stories. In the good ones, the story revolves around real people struggling with difficult situations. But in this one, based on their reactions to various ridiculous situations, every character in this story behaved as though borderline insane or deranged or drugged. I rated this a 2 instead of 1 for the nice scenery and for Rachel Weiss who is always a pleasure to watch. Both were wasted on this nonsense.A week after watching the first hour, I watched the balance to see if there was anything interesting or thought provoking to take away from this. There was not. My best summary for this is: boring, disturbing, sick, and a waste of time."
" We are currently living in similar dystopia
",2018-04-30 00:00:00,9,"I just watched this movie today, after watching ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" by the same director, Yorgos Lanthimos, and also featuring Colin Farrell.Lanthimos makes movies in the same genre as Stanley Kubrick (most notably ""The Shining"" and ""Clockwork Orange."").In movies that touch topics like dystopia and humanity and its vices, this one is one of those that I usually sit and think about by a window with a nice hot cup of coffee.Throughout human history, we as species, are smart enough to think up rules of how we live among one another, but sometimes are very dumb as to think of the logic of why those rules exist. Most rules are made up by usually of one man or one group who happen to think it, and for the rest of history, it stays as a rule. Examples include, why do Hindus not eat cow (beef)? Why did the Salem Witch Hunt occur; how about the Spanish Inquisition? How did Joseph McCarthy come into power? Why can't a family unit consist of two women or two men raising a child? What are the consequences of one-child policy of China today? Or how about the idea that humans need to carry on their family name while wishing for a son. All of them because one man or group of men, thought it might make sense (at that time.) But I repeat myself.Those are the crazy questions that come about in real world, as the fictional world of the Lobster is just as crazy. I assume your parents have always asked you, when are you gonna get married and bring me a grandchild. Everyone probably has a crazy uncle or traveling aunt who never married. Remember the term, spinsters, alluding to a stereotype of an older woman who is unmarried, childless, prissy, and repressed. Those are the exact goals of the dystopia world of David, where you need to be a coupled or otherwise you are useless to this world, and we rather have you be useful as an animal.But besides thinking of crazy rules for 7 billions human beings to follow, the movie also brings out the dysfunctionality of rules that are to be followed by what we today call the Government, or the state. Crazy ideas at one time about slavery, sitting in back of buses, not sharing drinking fountains, no free speech for certain people, but just as much free hate speech for others, diversity and tolerance only for those who agree with you, etc.The movie shows that on either side (the left or the right) there is dysfunction. The two groups, the hotel runs it like a prison, where masturbation gets your hands burned; and when you get away free, the Loners has its own set of ridiculous rules to follow, like no flirting. At the mall, there's the set of rules where you need to have your papers (like drivers licence or passport) with you at all times. Humans are ridiculous, in deed and indeed.We are currently living in a dystopian world right now, where Trump is capitalizing on people's craziness for bias, double standard, false news reported as truth, and resistance. Just as dystopia was when certain group thought Jews deserve to be burned in ovens. We are living in a dystopia and not even know it. That's what the Lobster is trying to say."
" Original, humorous but ultimately unsatisfying
",2018-04-27 00:00:00,7,"This is a very original storyline with very offbeat humour. It challenges us to consider our own hangups about love and social expectations. But after challenging our conceptions, it doesn't deliver us to any new epiphany or new insight. No conclusions are drawn from the experience of the story and we are left with a worldview undermined, but without an alternative proferred to us. No better way of doing things is discovered.However, I'm still rating this highly for it's sheer ooriginality and daring. There is an honesty to the rigidity of the characters thoughts which i appreciated also"
" Darkly funny and really original
",2018-04-23 00:00:00,7,"The Lobster is slyly funny and surprisingly dark - there were a few moments that left me reeling which I did not expect going in. It will probably be too ""slow"" for a few people but I think this is deliberate; the film uses repetition in a really interesting way to hit home the banality of the world. It's also beautifully shot and manages to be a stunning looking film despite the images being largely static - it reminded me of The Shining for this reason."
" True Reflection of Society???
",2018-04-18 00:00:00,1,"HAHAHAHA NOPE! If you can sit through the whole entire thing, then I commend you! I barely made it, and my pride in my ability to put up with it for its entirety was the best part of the movie.YAY ME!!"

",2018-04-06 00:00:00,10,"The lobster is brilliant. I read that a lot of people didn't like the film because it makes so sense, which I found to be the opposite for me. I enjoyed the movie MORE because it made no sense. There were a lot of really well executed jokes and the use of music was amazing in this film. I enjoyed it a lot and would definitely recommend it."
" This Lobster Stinks
",2018-04-02 00:00:00,1,"This movie is utterly dreadful, possibly the worst film I've ever seen in more than 50 years of movie-watching. This is not a story about human beings, it's about cardboard automatons moving around a landscape, doing and saying things that actual humans never would. ""True reflections of our society""? ""An absurdist screwball comedy""? In some nightmare parallel universe, maybe. Words aren't adequate to describe how much I loathed this film. It made me want to poke my own eyes out so I would never again have to watch a movie as bad as this one. I wish I could give it a rating of zero. Run away! Run far, far away!!"
" Highly symbolical (and/or absurd) and thought-provoking
",2018-03-17 00:00:00,7,"Here's a note I wrote to my friend who had endorsed the film to me:""I have just watched The Lobster, which you also recommended. It was very good. Perhaps the best ""artsy"" film I have seen (rating: 7/8 out of 10). I can easily imagine that it sits very well with a cinephile like yourself.
I can also understand why some people hate this kind of movie. It is probably a matter of whether one is willing to watch a movie as symbolism - and still feel that you get something out of it. If you watch this kind of film through glasses of realism you will feel frustrated.
The movie emphasized many points about relationships and relationship status in our culture and it also had a beautiful symbolism about sacrifice in love."""
" To lie or to die

Unique picture of human struggles whether to fight againts the body to win the human nature or to lie constantly about even every single detail. Very wide perspective of absurd and in the same time the film leaves an audience with a slight hope for normality."
" What was this movie about?
",2018-03-06 00:00:00,1,I saw it till the end; why... I don't know? What was that all about? Making fun of something? Love? ... And that's the crux of this movie. You watch it and you are confused; why did you watch it. But i am sure you won't feel good at the end because it would seem you have wasted almost two hours of your life on something that left nothing on your mind. Just questions. Why was this movie made and why did you see it. Believe me you will not curse the movie but yourself. Its big bboooooooooooooo......
" Really weird.
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,5,"I'm not sure how to feel about this movie. Its pretty strange.Acting/Characters - None of the characters show any emotion. The line delivery is flat and lifeless all around. Somehow, the characters seem to have personalities, but that might just be me projecting myself on them. That could be the point. The acting is good, though. I can believe how nothing the characters are. They are all consistent. Plot - The pacing is very slow, and the plot, though stupid, is fairly easy to follow. Its hard to tell why everyone is doing everything because of the lack of characters but its still an ok plot. I think its supposed to be a comedy but I didn't really find any of it funny. It wasn't boring either. Just really strange.Sights and Sounds - There are a lot of long takes. One the one hand, its impressive. On the other, it doesn't help with the pacing. This movie is much longer than it needs to be. The music is extremely repetitive and the same few scores are reused again and again. Absurdity - This movie doesn't actually get that absurd other than the idea of people turning into animals (which is never really shown). The weirdest part is that no-one has any emotions and everyone talks really casually about everything. Though the main distinguishing feature about this movie is that its weird, its actually not as weird as it could've been. If this whole concept was redone and the characters actually had emotions and fell in love over actual personalities, this could actually be very entertaining. I'd also have enjoyed it more if it followed someone who turned into an animal which has the potential to be funny. This movie was mainly weird and boring. This movie is listed as a Drama and a Comedy, but it is neither.Narration - There is some really weird narration throughout the entire movie (it starts at the beginning and I don't think that this counts as a spoiler) that is never explained. In most of the instances of the narration, you get to hear about things that happened directly after they happen which is annoying. Overall, this movie is full of wasted potential. Though I enjoyed watching this movie, I wouldn't recommend it or watch it again. The only reason you should watch this is out of curiosity. Be warned though, this movie is boring, uncomfortable, weird and kind of stupid."
" The Lobster
",2018-03-04 00:00:00,8,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, the story is set in a somewhat dystopian future were everyone is expected to get married. Trivial things become the corner stone of relationships like nose bleeds and limps. The story takes the ideas of love, relationships, and societies view of love and turns it into a terrifying world. The story is at time funny and horrifying. The ending is very ambiguous and leaves you feeling stunned. Yorgos Lanthimos directed Dogtooth which is also a black comedy with some very interesting social questions that is much like The Lobster.The acting is very good. Colin Farrell performs the best as an average Joe with nothing special about him at all. Rachel Weisz also performs well as she narrates the story and plays a pivotal part in Colin Farrell's characters story. John C. Reily, Ben Whishaw, Angeliki Papoulia, and Lea Seydoux all perform well.The pacing is very bland and slow. It is done on purpose though. The film wants us to turn into Colin Farrell's character and see his meaningless existence. The music is also a little repetitive and the runtime is overlong. Pros: Interesting, funny, and dark story, great performance by Colin Farrell, good overall acting, a good ending, and slow pacing that was meant on purposeCons: Slow pacing, an overlong runtime, and repetitive use of musicOverall Rating: 8.2"
" Disappointmet
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,1,"I was not sure if I wanted to watch it after reading the plot summary. Colin Farell and a good imdb rating convinced me to and I must say it was the first time both of them let me down. Totally boring, no serious plot, no beginning, no end, no closure, nothing. I wish I could get those 2 hours of my life back."
" More absurd than necessary
",2018-02-23 00:00:00,7,"The Lobster is a very difficult movie to assess. Its premise is so ridiculous and absurd that it's bound to be a divisive movie that isn't for everyone. The first half in particular is a difficult sit through, as due to their absurdity, many story elements seem completely random at first. It's only halfway through that things seem to click together, and an impressively cohesive story emerges. I'm actually so impressed with the underlying story, that I believe this would have made a terrific science fiction movie if played a little more seriously. It is basically a movie about a dystopian future in which people are forced to become married or run the risk of being turned into an animal, or being hunted if trying to avoid this outcome. There are some very interesting reflections on the pressures of society to find a partner and the superficial ways that people get together and pretend to be someone else in order to avoid ending up alone. Interestingly, the fugitive group of loners is equally as radical in their approach, forcing their members to stay alone and punishing them for showing any type of romantic affection towards another. I see this broadly as a remark on society in general, in which there are extremists on both ends of the political spectrum, each hating the other, but neither one being particularly desirable from a neutral point of view. Like always, the truth is somewhere in the middle. I found myself being thoroughly engaged in these ideas, but at times were taken out of it by the absurdist nature of many of the scenes. The deadpan and deliberately wooden acting is quirky and interesting at first, but grows tiresome rather quickly, and the dialogue seemed very scripted and unnatural (as it was intended). I also personally didn't think it was as funny as the writers hoped I would think, being left confused and frustrated at some scenes rather than laughing at them. I'm sure many will disagree, and believe the absurdity is at the core of the film and the movie wouldn't have worked without it. Indeed, it might have run the risk of being a little more run-of-the-mill if played more seriously and left in less capable hands. However, the underlying ideas were so strong that I really don't think it needed the excessive absurdity. I believe this might be a case of the writers underestimating the quality of their screenplay and throwing in some quirky things to make it seem a bit more alternative and anti-mainstream than it needed to be. Even the central concept of turning into an animal if failing to find a partner within 45 days was superfluous to the main story. The movie would have worked just as well if a different type of punishment was presented. Or at least it could have been given a bit more prominence. The fact that the animals that are walking around were once humans is being mentioned in a throwaway line or two, but never really fully explored. I'm not saying it should have been a full on dark and gritty science-fiction drama. It could have retained its satirical outlook, which suits the story quite well. It just went a little overboard with trying to seem as weird and quirky as possible, which is a shame as The Lobster is now mainly being remembered as 'that weird movie in which humans turn into animals', even though there's so much more to this great story."
" Everything you hope a ""black comedy"" won't be
",2018-02-18 00:00:00,1,"It's borderline unbelievable that this film could have amassed a rating of around 7. That it has is proof of people priding themselves on being able to see the masterpiece in a slow, senseless, pointless piece of garbage, all in the name of art.None of the behaviours are even remotely logical. The characters literally don't show emotion. I couldn't ascertain whether this was supposed to mean something, or made sense in the book, but it was just plain bizarre.If there was allegory or satire here, it eluded me. If you saw it, good for you, you must be so intelligent.I strongly suggest no-one waste their time with this movie."
" Slow, thoughtful, ultimately unsatisfying
",2018-02-16 00:00:00,6,"You know how there is pressure to conform, find a partner and live a ""normal life""? You know how those who don't conform appear to live unsatisfying lives whilst protesting that they are not? This film takes an hour to say that, then the second hour offers no answers and has an ambiguous and unsatisfying ending."
" PLEASE DON'T WASTSE YOUR TIME!
",2018-02-15 00:00:00,1,"Well, I've just wasted 2 hours and 20 minutes of my life. To describe this film as a comedy, is absurd, it was more like a cheap British horror flick. The only reason I watched this film was because of Colin Farrell, loving his performance in ""In Bruges"". 
Not one of the characters had any redeeming features, they all behave as if they're autistic, or not quite the ticket. There's no story as such, it just ambles along, and then ends. If you like weird, illogical story lines then it might be your bag, I wouldn't inflict this film on my worst enemy. What surprised me most, is the amount of high profile actors that agreed to be in it. On a positive note, the scenery was beautiful and eye catching. This film left me feeling like I'd just woken from a bad dream. Just weird, for weird sake."
" Its fun and its meaningful.
",2018-02-06 00:00:00,8,"What can i say except Fun. this movie bridges the gap of subtle humor and emotional tension and keeps the entertainment flowing through out. the first half is funny in a way that makes fun of it self. the idea of finding love when every one is so boring and plain about what they think is the humor but also the plot. the idea of being one or the other, Black and white is the Joke. it gets more serious and focuses on the emotional aspects in the second half. I wont go into the way it represents society because its about relationships and i dunno about them. A good film i sat down and enjoyed the whole way through."
" it is absolutly different!!
",2018-02-04 00:00:00,9,This scenerio is very diffrent.Scriptwriter want to explain something about relationships between man and woman.Love isn't need for be a couple in the movie.The most important thing is similarity.if you are lime person you would find a lime partner.Final scene impress me:) i dont wanna be blind.

But, the people don't seem to be doing much to find a mate.
Obviously, David enjoyed sex because it's one of the first 
things he and the ""heartless woman"" did when they got together.
Yet, he turned down the biscuit girl for sex. 45 DAYS and his
time was clearly running out. They at LEAST had sex in
common which was SOMETHING. He had virtually
NOTHING in common with the heartless woman.
If you are going to fake a relationship, fake being
a sexaholic instead of being emotionless. Yes???
A lot more fun. And, what was up with the Lonelys. Why the
rule of no hook-ups?? It seems not a very good way
to live being hunted all the time and if you got hooked 
up you wouldn't be in violation of the law anymore. 
Or did I miss something?? It seems they would WANT to be
hooked up to live in the city. And what as up with the donkey? I know, I know..
probably some ex-husband or something But
why leave it unexplained?They left TOO much unexplained. Seemed to me
they were trying to leave as much as they could
unexplained as possible. A good story needs to be explained well enough
to understand what you just watched."
" In the lineage of ""1984""
",2018-01-15 00:00:00,8,"Some movies are fascinating without being enjoyable--maybe emotionally dissatisfying but intellectually compelling. That's ""The Lobster"" for me. I have to add that I did get some emotional satisfaction out of the sheer quality of acting and visuals, the general fabric of the film--or else the casual animal and human deaths would have caused me to leave the theatre. Then watching it again, I realized the humor takes hold of me and I will sit through the very dark joke.
It is definitely science fiction about a future dystopian society. Those who think sci-fi has to come with wild special effects and mind-blowing hardware and latex body suits need to remember that sociology, anthropology and psychology are also sciences. However, as a staunch fan of Rocket the racoon, I have to say piles of space alien carnage are easier to take that the animal deaths in The Lobster. BUT--The Lobster IS STILL A GOOD PIECE OF CINEMATIC SCI FI."

" A brilliant movie that needed...something
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,7,"The concept here is pretty brilliant: a dystopian reality that legislates coupledom. From single people becoming animals to characters being defined by their limitations, this film points out the absurdities of our society's obsession with romance. In fact, it borrows heavily from the theater of the ""absurd."" And that's both genius and problematic. Because it's hard to care about flat characters who engage with sillier and sillier circumstances. I kept thinking this movie should be amazing...without ever caring what happened to the protagonists. And that's kind of a problem."

" Clever but not enjoyable, downbeat tale of dystopian community
",2017-12-26 00:00:00,5,"I can't disagree that the subject of Yorgos Lanthimos' ""The Lobster"" is a dystopian community. Dystopia is defined as a community that is undesirable or frightening but usually stories about such communities are set in the future. Lanthimos, however, provides no back story to his seemingly futuristic narrative, so it probably would be better to label it a ""fable."" From interviews I've read, Lanthimos is content to have viewers draw their own conclusions as to what the film is about. He apparently has drawn no conclusions of his own and is more devoted to the creative process in contrast to offering up a calculated ""message.""Lanthimos' vision is a bleak one at that. His protagonist is David (a one-note Colin Farrell), who finds himself at a special hotel after his wife has left him for another man. In this universe, if you don't have a mate, you have 45 days to find another one, or else you're transformed into an animal. This is perhaps the weakest part of the film, as the transformation process is never explained or shown and you just have to accept this plot point on faith--which seriously damages the overall verisimilitude of the narrative.The hotel residents can extend their stay by hunting ""loners"" in the forest by shooting them with tranquilizer darts. Other rules become apparent such as no masturbation (but sexual stimulation by the hotel maid is mandatory). David befriends two men; one, Robert, is punished for masturbating by having his hand burned inside a toaster-the other, John, purposely bangs his head on tables so that his nose will bleed. The main rule for mating is that the couples should have some idiosyncrasy in common. John finds a woman who suffers from nosebleeds and the two are paired off.David ends up finding a woman who has the highest ""kill"" rate in shooting loners in the forest. While in a Jacuzzi, she feigns choking, and David, desiring to prove that he's as cold as her, sits there impassively. The woman decides to partner up with David but things take a real bizarre turn when she kicks a dog to death (who happens to be David's brother-transformed earlier into a dog). When David cries, she realizes his earlier ""cruel act"" was a ruse and drags him to the hotel manager, ordering that David immediately be turned into an animal.David I suppose has the last laugh, when, with the aid of a sympathetic maid at the hotel, he tranquilizes the woman, who is turned into an animal. At this point David escapes from the hotel and joins the loners in the forest. You would expect the loners to be the ""good guys"" but this is where Lanthimos proffers up what might be called a ""twist"" of sortsThe loners don't believe in romance at all and if you try to become a couple, they'll mutilate you. The head of the loners (Léa Seydoux) leads raids to disrupt the activities at the hotel. David breaks into John's cottage and reveals to his mate that his nosebleeds are artificially induced. Worse, the head of the loners convinces the husband of the hotel manager to willingly shoot her, which he does, only to discover that the gun is loaded with blanks.The second half of the plot deals with David meeting another loner, a shortsighted woman (Rachel Weisz). Since David is also shortsighted, they bond and plan to run away together. But a mole discovers the woman's journal and she's brought to the city in a ruse to cure her shortsightedness. Instead a doctor intentionally blinds the woman.David and the woman still decide to run away and in a bizarre climax, David enters the bathroom in a restaurant where he is about to intentionally blind himself with a knife, so the couple will still have something in common with one another.That's it folks! It's all very clever and probably designed to be a little shocking in its unrelenting, bleak view of people who are unable to rebel against the authoritarian world they find themselves in. It could be a parable for a place like North Korea but there's not enough history to explain the world we find ourselves observing. David's decision to mutilate himself suggests that he hasn't been able to escape the world he seeks to rebel against. Since there's little to cheer about here, we're left to admire the director's imagination-but his downbeat tale doesn't prove very enjoyable or even that enlightening."
" David Lynch wannabe?
",2017-12-21 00:00:00,4,Yorgos Lanthimos gives David Lynch a run for his money with this film.
" Just want to talk about its time setting
",2017-12-17 00:00:00,8,"The film didn't specify the year - so you can say it is a story about either future or past, or whenever the time you think is reasonable. But funny enough, I really like the way the director sets it.The technology they use to turn human into animal, and the way they operate the hotel, or, the social system, make you feel like it is from the future. Plus, the way people talk in the film (unemotional - in fact, I find that it is the director's intention to have characters act that way to make the film look surreal) gives you a stronger ""future"" feeling.However, if you look at the facilities - the entire hotel, the yachts, people's dresses - everything looks so old fashioned, like it is from 70s. Especially the way how Colin expressed David - serious, cautious, introverted - literally a dogmatic guy from decades ago.I believe there is a reason the director designed it that way. The conflicts more or less satirized the advanced technology versus backwards social system and people's cognition. There is another conflict in the film - couples and loners. Both use extreme approaches to maintain and manage its systems. However, there is no right and wrong side, it is just how you choose. Ironically, David (Colin) is always on the wrong side. He was a loner in the hotel, and fell in lover in the woods. What a sarcasm.In the end, what would be in front of them? Would David finally sacrifice to fit into the system? And, would the system accept them? To me, it's an open question too."
" Another pretentious crap by Yorgos Lanthimos.
",2017-12-17 00:00:00,6,"I have watched ""The Lobster"" after watching ""The Killing of A sacred deer"", and I must say ""The Lobster"" is much worse.Yorgos Lanthimos probably is addicted to making pretentious, overly-symbolic movies and yet he forgets that a good movie is not made of symbols or weird movie scripts, but of good character development, good cinematography and a decent movie duration.Here, we don't have any of these 3 items. Character development is one of the poorest I have ever seen in a movie. The way actors speak make they look like robots. I am pretty sure Lanthimos wanted this to happen on purpose to make the movies look ""quirkier"" , but it only makes the movie boring and insufferable to watch. Léa Seydoux's and Rachel Weisz's ridiculously amateurish performances made me want to punch them in their faces. I swear, they are worse than amateur actors having drama classes in high school. Colin Farrell makes the movie more palatable, giving a very natural and humble performance, but he cannot save the movie, because once again, HIS CHARACTER IS NOT DEVELOPED. We cannot give a damn about anything about him. We don't care. Lanthimos creates characters we don't care about.Regarding cinematography, mediocre at most. Though photography is okay, the soundtrack kills the movie. I was almost going insane with all those cellos, being repetitively played in every scene. Enough is enough. Also, the movie is too long for a mediocre story. Yes, the story is mediocre and disappointing. I was mildly interested during the first half at the hotel - which seemed to be a parody of our sick and disturbed society, but after the main character leaves the hotel and goes to woods, the movie becomes a poorly developed crappy love story. What a pretentious and boring movie. Like I said about ""The Killing of a sacred deer"", Lanthimos thinks his movies are better than they really are. He probably thinks he's the next Kubrick but he's definitely not him."
" You are in for something special
",2017-12-13 00:00:00,1,"I consider myself to be a avid movie fan. Anything from any genre or decade ill give a watch. I've loved everything from Star Wars to a space odyssey, from pulp fiction to Django, from a clockwork orange to trainspotting, from the lion king to good will hunting. I think you get my point. I try to see anything that hits the big screen, and some that hasn't. I loved a lot but I've also seen my fair share of bad movies. At the end of this movie , for the first time ever, I was able to say ""this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life"" and know it was 100% true. Before I go on, I will say that the actors/actresses in this I really do like, from top to bottom, so no bias in that respect. the fact that this movie was even mad is mind boggling, never mind the casting they some how pulled in for this movie. It is a dark and unpleasant movie that was so terrible it'll make you uncomfortable in your own home. From start to finish this unpleasant movie will make you regret you own a tv. How this movie was even considered a comedy is preposterous . I get in the era of film we are in, that today the dark and different independent films and dark twisted comedies are praised more then ever. I myself find a lot of them refreshing from your cookie cutter Hollywood movies, good guy wins, bad guy loses, lessoned learned etc. etc. This film tho had no place ever being made or even thought of. I've always been able to watch even a bad movie and see why some people might like it or why it has a cult following but the fact that enough people rated this high enough to put it in the 7's is really disturbing to me. I really can't elaborate enough how terrible this movie really was. I truly believe it'll be a long time until another movie can come along and be able to take my top spot for worst movie of all time. All time worst movie experience in my life. hopefully this 2 mins of reading saved you the 2hours you would of spent watching this Mona Lisa of bad movies. 0/10. Enjoy."
" My mouth was hanging open for most of the film
",2017-12-02 00:00:00,10,Absolutely fascinating. Yorgos Lanthimos is a mad man and I love him for it. Dogtooth blew my mind. Lobster followed suit and was hands down my favorite movie of 2016. These films are so refreshingly weird and non-formulaic. Where can I stream The Killing of the Sacred Deer? Take my money!!
" One of the best movie experiences I had in a while
",2017-11-16 00:00:00,10,I recommend seeing this like I did. I had not seen any trailer or heard anything about this movie. My brother recommended it and said I should not look up anything because then I had no expectations and no knowledge of the plot which would make it surreal. The experience was surreal and fantastic. I liked that nothing was explained and I had no idea what was happening. It really gets you to think about relationships and social interactions. I would say I liked the first half better then the second half. The second half I think at times slows down to a halt.
" Lost at the end
",2017-11-13 00:00:00,6,"Nothing can prepare you for any Lanthimos next scene. A lesson I should have learned by watching Dogtooth.I pretty much had the exact same feelings (as the ones when watching Dogtooth) almost throughout the film: a sense of ""what if"", a disturbing curiosity about people behaviors in situations that you know just cannot exist.The problem was that halfway through, the narrative loses its orientation. Is it a social commentary? Is it an extreme love story? Is it an allegory?I can live with the disturbing images and ideas because I expected them beforehand. It's just that, the film loses focus and feels like it could have concluded almost an hour before it did.And had it done so, we would be speaking about a whole different movie."
" Why Brits need the French
",2017-10-28 00:00:00,10,"This is a great movie that seems very dystopian to Americans and, very likely, the French. Nonetheless, it's extremely romantic from the British perspective and explains why British couples frequently hire French couples to have children for them.What seem like awkward conversations to Americans are actually quite intimate -- by British standards of proper dialog. In deed, most of the conversations between couples is quite scandalous -- from a British point of view. If you're American (or French), you'll be wondering why they don't just say what they mean. The truth is, they are.This is one of the finest examples of British Romantic Comedy."
" Dystopia Is Better Tolerated With A Partner
",2017-10-27 00:00:00,7,"""The Lobster"" Features a comically dystopian story that is frightfully accurate. The score accentuates and compliments both form and content, always adding to but never intruding on the other elements. The Production design, cinematography, and Yorgos Lanthimos' vision come together spectacularly through the use of appropriate color, lighting, angles, and symbolism.Everything is placed into shots for a reason, whether it's an ominous tranquilizer gun, a now transformed family member, or a salt and pepper shaker set... Mise en scene is masterfully handled in a way that treats the appreciative viewer to one Easter egg after another.The story is brutally honest. We are already in a society that values partnerships (even forced partnerships) over singlehood, and ""The Lobster"" clearly satirizes this, but then goes one step farther to explore forced singledom. Both are unhealthy means to a traumatic and artificial end, as the unnerving ending of this film harrowingly demonstrates.Awarded a well deserved 7 stars of 10. I'm looking forward to Lanthimos' ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer."""
" How About That Ending Though?
",2017-10-23 00:00:00,1,"Let me start of by saying, What kind of ending was that! What a waste of time and film. The story started of alright then fell flat all the way down from the middle to the end. I rather watch Harry potter go camping for about an hour again then watch Lobster again.

" An anti-romance movie or a satire o society?
",2017-09-18 00:00:00,9,"Rather a critique/ satire of the way society can influence a relationship. I really like the way Lanthimos satirize society in his films, and even if I saw right now only two of his films (and don't have very much films by the way) I can see that he develop his style of making social commentary by exaggeration and absurdist situations. Of course he isn't the only one who is doing this, but his style of making those things is quite special, and personally I adore it. The Lobster is a film when you can discuses his symbolism and meaning for a while, and the humour and the absurd style of the narrative it's keeping the film for getting boring quickly. I'm not going to discuses it here anyway, yet I want to mention that I like (and I think that Lanthimos did a better job with) the symbolism/ satire here more than in Κυνόδοντας (Dogtooth), however as a move as whole I prefer Κυνόδοντας (Dogtooth) over The Lobster, I just consider that he did a better satire of society here, that's it. And yes, the aspects of society both movie critique are different, is just my opinion that the execution and the way he placed in the movie is more on my preference. Wow I talk more about this aspect that I talk about the movie itself. What absurd, but honestly I'm quite bad at ending reviews, so I will left you here."
" Not for the faint of heart
",2017-09-17 00:00:00,3,"I would completely concur this movie ranks near the top of absurdist or oddest films of the decade. The premises of this dystopian, yet contemporary, film are never explained nor defended--they simply are, which can be frustrating when the internal ""logic"" of the bizzaro world collapse. It reminds me of some type of comic television shows where anything is allowed for the sake of a joke, even if it means, for example, characters dying and being brought back to life to setup the next laugh line. Nothing is spared to keep the viewer in a state of bafflement. As with any avant-garde type of art, the defenders often ""see"" things that simply aren't there, in my view, and this film is also such a Rorschach test.In addition to the lack of coherence, I found the wanton cruelty and violence to be quite unnerving, yet I have a weak stomach for such things. I know not to see slasher-type films for this reason, yet this film gave no warning that it might not be suitable for sensitive eyes.I give it three stars for technical achievement and to prove I'm not a total Philistine and want directors/writers to try new things."
" Requires re-reading
",2017-09-17 00:00:00,1,"This movie is purely terrible. While I was watching it I began having a foul taste in my mouth. At first I thought it was the slightly expired baked beans I was eating out of the tin, however i quickly began to realize that it was in fact this movie. It was as if the pixels on my screen were excreting a foul odour that was getting caught on my taste buds. I truly revolting all round experience."
" Original and Peculiar
",2017-09-15 00:00:00,7,"(Flash Review)I watched it 90% because of the title alone (ha) and 10% the plot seemed original, which it most certainly was. In this world, people live in a society that dictates that you must be in a relationship at all times. Anyone 'found' to be without a mate, is bused to a hotel where you have 90 days to find a mate OR be turned into an animal.an animal of your choice at least. The staff at this hotel institute certain measure to facilitate the 'guests' to find mates. The film's tone is semi-dark and offbeat and all the color is heavily muted; lacking color saturation. There are some surreal moments and a fitting score while the story plays out at an methodical pace. The story tends to drag a little in act 2 but act 3 leaves many story points open ended with intrigue. The sub-message appears to hint at society's influence that people should strive for relationships/marriage and those who don't tend be treated as blacks sheep. Certainly worth a look for those seeking something anti- Transformers."
" I am short sighted too
",2017-08-28 00:00:00,7,"This is a ""what did I just watch?"" type of film filled with dry humor on relationships.David (Colin Farrell) loses his wife and goes to a rigidly run hotel to meet someone new and hopefully be able to be returned to the city. If he fails, he goes to the Transformation Room and is turned into an animal of his choosing, in his case a lobster. He is there with Bob, a dog who is his brother. Pairing is done rather oddly. One man gives himself nose bleeds so he can be judged compatible with a woman who suffers from nose bleeds. They pair and don't get turned into animals. Some humans resist being turned into animals and leave the hotel. They are called runners and are hunted by hotel guests to allot them extra time to pair up. David experiences life paired up, and then as a runner where he meets Rachel Weisz, a woman he truly loves. What he does for love will surprise you.The film rates as an ""oddball"" which I might of found funny watching it with the right crowd instead of alone. It is a frank look at relationships and something that could be studied at film school. It asks the question, ""If you could be any animal...."" While at the same time making us realize no one really wants to be that animal.Deeper than ""Logan's Run"" but not as blissfully entertaining.Guide: F-word. Implied sex. No nudity"
" Offbeat, very black comedy – not for everyone
",2017-08-28 00:00:00,7,"In a dystopian world, where single people are required to find appropriate partners or be turned into animals, a counterculture of loners exist, where romantic relationships are punished by mutilation. Colin Ferrell's character, whose wife has left him, moves from one culture, in which he has decided to become a lobster if he cannot find a mate, to the other, where he falls in love with Rachel Weisz's character, and suffers the consequences. The movie is slow moving, dead-pan and surreal – whimsical in some places, coarse and brutal in others. Cryptic and metaphorical, the story takes place in three locations: 'the hotel', where you need to find a mate, 'the woods' where the loners roam, and 'the city' where couples live. Keeping with the premise that you need to find your match rather than an autonomous person, few of the characters have names, but rather are known by a 'characteristic' (e.g. girl with nose bleeds) that is the basis for initial pairing (if a singleton) or by their job (e.g. 'the maid). Funny at times, especially when the po-faced hotel management are explaining the system, but certainly not for all tastes."
" Surreal, Absurd, Endearing & Funny; THE LOBSTER is a Bizarre One I Highly Recommend
",2017-08-21 00:00:00,8,"The latest film I can obsessively recommend to my friends, knowing they'll probably never watch it, is THE LOBSTER. I think I first took notice of it when Cracked mentioned it in an article on (then) upcoming insane movies that weren't getting enough attention and the plot synopsis demanded I track down this movie and watch it as soon as I could. In THE LOBSTER, Colin Farrell is a man who is recently single and must attend a program wherein he has 45 days to find a new mate or he will be turned into an animal. He chooses as his potential future animal a lobster because of their long life, blue blood, and lifetime of fertility. The film, from Greek writer/director Yorgos Lanthimos, is set in a dystopian world where relationships are government- regulated and loners, those who manage to escape their transformative fate, are outcasts that live in the forests. People attending the resort in search of a mate can extend their time through a hunting ritual where they're released into the woods with tranquilizer guns to hunt the loners, garnering additional days for every loner they bring in for transformation. The film chronicles the desperation of our main character David (Farrell) as he does whatever he can to find a new connection before accepting more drastic measures and going the route of a fugitive loner, where he happens to meet a lovely woman (Rachel Weisz) who might in fact be his ideal mate, assuming they get out alive.THE LOBSTER is a surreal gem of a film that I can't seem to shake from my mind for a while after watching it. There's just so much here to break down and examine. I'm obsessed with the strange world that Lanthimos and co- writer Efthymis Filippou have created. We've got this bizarre world where the government mandates that everyone must have a mate to the point where, if authorities see you wandering a city alone, they can demand to see your papers verifying your relationship status. There's a strange recurring theme where you can only exist as either end of a spectrum with no gray area in between. For example, in addition to the outright relationship vs. loner existence, there's a moment at the beginning of the film where David is partaking in the resort's entrance exam and he's asked his sexual orientation. He claims as heterosexual but then admits he had engaged in some experimentation at a point earlier in life and wanted to know if he could be labeled bisexual but, no, this isn't allowed (there is some mention that this had caused some complications within the program at some point in the past). Each society exists by a strict set of rules that operate as polar opposites; masturbation at the resort will get your hand mauled whereas making out in the loner tribe will scar you with the ""red kiss"". It's all so strange and infinitely interesting with a hint of vague social commentary on relationships within.I find it difficult to make a case for people to check out THE LOBSTER. If you're not as intrigued by the strange world Lanthimos and Filippou have created as I am, you might find the movie dull. It's got a very dry sense of humor and all of the dialogue is delivered in a flat, matter-of-fact manner with little or no emotion with few exceptions. The characters are almost robotic in their behavior and the only ones who come across as near-human are David and Weisz's short-sighted woman. There's another strange element: Farrell's David is the only character in the entire movie with a name. Everyone else is defined by a trait. Weisz is short-sighted. John C. Reilly has a lisp. Ben Wishaw has a limp. The characters populating the world of THE LOBSTER define themselves by one outstanding trait and seek their mate based on that trait, to the point that some will even fake it just to avoid transformation; even when not trapped in the ""civilized"" world, David desperately seeks that shared trait with the short-sighted woman to feel secure in his affections for her. I find more to love about this quirky little film the more I mull it over in my mind and I'm sure there's an audience for this sort of oddity out there but I know it could very well be off-putting for a lot of people. It's surreal, absurd, funny, and endearing, and now I kind of want to watch it again."
" Worst movie ever!

But to my dismay the middle story going forward was just pure nonsense and rubbish.It has been a while I reviewed a movie. This could not just slip under the radar. A movie can be weird, absurd and interesting but the director lost it in this one."
" pretentious
",2017-08-04 00:00:00,1,"I didn't realize until half way through the movie. In the end I kept skipping the film it was so boring, because it kept trying to be quirky. And the French dialogue just made it so obvious. Also the dancing with the head phones in, yep we get it you're different. But the dialogue was just so annoying. You could tell they were trying to hard to be abnormal. The blonde French girl- her acting is just- she just looks like she's being smug, just because she's in an 'arr film'. And in the end I don't get why Colin and Rachel (can't remember character names) were running, they didn't need to. And why did he Sta himself- that just makes him useless."
" Absolute unadulterated drivel
",2017-08-03 00:00:00,1,"Set in a bleak future, where everybody seems to have been stripped of any resemblance of emotion or mental activity, this movie works on a ridiculous premise, and fails miserably as producing anything worthwhile. The movie is billed as a comedic drama, but the only comedic element is the fact that the director makes you sit for 119 minutes, desperately clinging to the hope that this movie will eventually reach an even moderately acceptable conclusion. Which it doesn't.The Lobster makes no attempt to explain the actions of any of the characters, and exits with an open ending just as pointless as the first 118 minutes. I'm sure that the director is proud of this movie, and I would be too. Proud that I had actually convinced studio executives to back this mental retardation of the silver screen.Don't! Just don't! You're better than that! Your life is worth more than this!"
" brutal and nothing like the trailer
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,1,"The trailer made this look sort of funny and insightful, it was neither. This is a brutal, violent, horrible movie that wasted 2 hours of my time. AVOID at all costs! The acting is fair enough, the plot twist has potential, but in the end this just went nowhere. And the violence to animals, even though you know it's ""just a movie"" left me heart broken and sad. I wish I had read more reviews before wasting my time, and I'm baffled that this gets a 7.1 currently (7/17). Seriously?!"
" Pretentiously ""intellectual"", ridden with flaws – in logic, and in direction.
",2017-07-07 00:00:00,5,"A social critique, but through a parody ridden with flaws – in logic, and in direction. Pretentiously ""intellectual"", funny if you are into sadism – and cynical. Original? Yes, but so what? The acting is flat – intentionally? Who cares. The ""story"" grabs you at the beginning, but parts are even predictable. They probably thought they were making an ""art"" film – in this case, by nerds for nerds. I hope to forget it soon."
" humans being cruel, terrible definition of love, wooden dialog.
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,2,"Even the beautiful Weisz could do nothing to make this a worthwhile 2 hours. Not worth wasting anyone's time to watch. I don't think that I give anything away with the review, so I am not marking this a spoiler, because the movie has almost nothing to actually spoil.I guess the movie is a commentary on the fickleness of love and the things that we do to be in love, and what we think love is, and etc. Somehow the whole thing is predicated on a view that love is merely an on-off switch that requires equal defects between two persons. Maybe if you asked an alien what love is, this movie would be the answer.I think of the movie as 2 narratives stuck together: 1) a man that isn't in love being in a place where he tries to force love, followed by 2) that same man being in a place where love is forbidden and he is in love. Both settings show absurd personal and institutional cruelty against humans, animals, etc.Some of the sexual dialogue is clearly intended to shock or amuse, but it doesn't and it seems out of place. There is a light torture scene with a toaster (no worse than Ghostbusters 2). The delivery of dialog is purposefully stilted/wooden and the characters are 1- dimensional. The training skits are like kindergarten meets 1984. I guess this all contributes to the simplistic view that this movie takes.That's it.. that's the whole movie.If there were some depth of the characters....if they had found true love in a world of simple love, it could have been a tragically beautiful love story. Instead, it's 2 hours that you won't get back."
" Favorite film in the last two years.. Amazing and overlooked!
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,10,Wow.. Yorgos is an absolute genius. Colin Farrell gets the role of his lifetime and just kills it. I would have given both men Oscars. This was easily the best movie but the Oscars snub-ed it not sure why? Maybe they try to choose American productions more... Who knows they blew it and we all know that. I have seen this film six times now and it is incredible entertainment every time. Watch this film and enjoy the best black comedy in recent history!
" What must we do?
",2017-06-18 00:00:00,7,"This movie illustrates the problems of social pressure that has to do with marriage and to choose to fit in in a group of others who are like you. It criticizes this subject in a quite comical way. The setting and the plot of the story is obviously exaggerated and only representative of some aspects of the problem. But it does succeed it carrying the deliberate meaning and making the viewer think about the subject again. The overall aura of the movie is dull and awkwardly calm. Not only the visuals, but even the way the characters speak is bland and abnormal. The dullness might make the movie tedious for some people, but it also adds to the effect of delivering its message. Although this movie is saying how the social pressure to conform is unnecessary and even ridiculous, it has an ironic ending, that although is a cliffhanger, leaves room for the viewers to think about it."
" A dreadful film which shouldn't exist
",2017-06-13 00:00:00,2,"Thinking that his wife no longer loves him, a man is sent to a hotel where he must find a partner within 45 days or be turned into an animal of his choice.Although it sounded like a good idea, this movie turned out to be a completely different animal than what I was expecting. It portrays a series of events, taken by a couple of characters which seem to be completely retarded. Whatever they do, even the most basic acts, like speaking, seems awkward, stupid and even sometimes degrading. The events which occur seem to lead nowhere, thus making it as boring as hell, very slow paced and ultimately pointless.While it manages to keep you focused for a whopping 10 minutes, it simply loses grip thanks to its idiotic and senseless plot, not to mention the completely retarded characters. It's a very bad movie which simply insults your intelligence, presents absolutely nothing while it was supposed to draw a smile on your face every once in a while. I'm very surprised that this kind of abominations receive such large acclaims and to say that it was an Oscar nominee makes matters even worse.I cannot tell you how much I regret the time wasted with this nonsense. Furthermore, I simply cannot understand how the two main actors, Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz, for whom I have high appreciation, decided to accept such dreadful roles in such a bad movie. I can only encourage you to avoid it by far but you would still want to see it out of curiosity as I did and eventually ending up in an utter disappointment which is quite hard to express only by words."
" Great original concept
",2017-06-06 00:00:00,8,"Screenplay: the movie shows a society that treats relationships in a logical way which it's necessary to be in one (and if don't find someone who loves you, you'll be transformed in an animal) and you would only love someone if that person has the same characteristics or interests. It demonstrates how we are dependent of attention and love to a point where society demands that someone must be in love.Acting: the acting is really dull and in some way robotic, but it fits for the theme of the movie. The people in this world behave in a logical way. They don't fall in love because of love (duh!) but because it's the only logical choice.Scenario/Costume: I really like how the design of the Hotel tries to prove that couples are better than single persons as the former has access to superior levels of the hotel, yachts and cooler activities. The same can be said about the costume, the couples always wear suits, tuxedos and dresses, while the loners (the guild of the singles) look like hobbos.Directing: the directing is really great (specially about the scenario part i said before) but what really bothers me is that the movie never explain why everyone in the Hotel wears the same clothes. I can't think of a reason why this would help the residents or the staff."
" Weirdly Captivating
",2017-05-29 00:00:00,7,"While this film has some predictable moments, it is one of those films that draws you in until the end, you know what is going to happen but the whens and hows will surprise you. As always Rachel Weisz and Colin Farrell deliver a wonderful performances. This could have just as easily been a war movie with partisans rising up against a cruel dictatorship, but is a love story. While the concept of single people having to find a partner or be turned into animals is interesting, it is a little far fetch, they go to all this trouble to find a partner but only have 45 days to do so, if you don,t want to be turned into an animal then go to the hotel meet someone and fake it!, wouldn't be the first time...unless there is some sort of rule that you can't try again later, needs a little more explanation. Be warned this is a weird movie. There are lots of weird movies out there but this one is at the top of the heap. Recommended if you are not looking for another rehash of an action flick or a love story."
" Ghastly
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,1,"I'm not going into a long dissection like others. I understand the movie and what it means, but that does not negate the fact it's absolutely ghastly to watch. It's boring, crude, yet stupidly so. I felt as though I were slipping into a coma, so I skooted to the end, saw an absurd ending and happily shut it off. Colin Farrell really chubbed out for this movie, but..overall I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy."
" The loss of love
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,9,"A fiction aligned with a context of present drama elevated to the extreme, the searches for the indenity, for someone that completes to him, and the search of the love through futilities are bad of our world to which the film portrays of a sarcastic and unique way. We have an extremely creative script, making a satire to great Hollywood films of dystopian futures like voracious games, Divergent, Maze Runner ... and mixed a black humor to the best style ""Dr. fantastic"" the script creates a world of exaggerated situations , Intelligent, with very interesting characters and very different from what we are accustomed to see. A world where everyone has to find the ""soul mate"", otherwise you will be sent to a hotel, where if you do not even find the love of your life, you will be transformed into an animal of your choice, in this context, we have Our protagonist David (Colin Farrel), who is sent to the hotel, but ends up living with the singles of the forest, a group of social renegades who live on the margins of a society subjected to love. The moral of the film aims at portraying that today we live in a gigantic emotional lack, where those who achieve it are successful and oppress the needy, because of this oppression in the search for the ideal pair, the small similarities between man and woman already Are enough to be considered couples, we live in a world to have the same taste goes beyond love, and such subtleties are portrayed in an exemplary way in the film. Technically the film has a photograph with many shades of gray, but extremely natural, with many scenes recorded in the light of day, and using many open angles, the photography is extremely cold but has an intrinsic beauty in its depression, with a good edition , An almost absence of makeup that brings a natural and transgressive beauties and an apathetic costume, we must also mention her soundtrack, the music that is rambunctious, she is melancholic with classic touches mixed with strong beats, makes the viewer feel the weight of Film, mixed the narration and black humor, the feeling caused is something unique, we do not have great highlights in the performances, because they are all caricatures, and the model of acting of the film is extra bold, as its script, we have extremely theatrical performances that help To compose even more the climate of the film, we must also mention the director yorgos lanthimos, already known by the great ""Canine Tooth"" the director has a way Extremely European and beautiful to drive, look forward to your next films. Finally ""The Lobster"" is a film that takes outdated concepts and reinvents them in a magnificent way, we have an extremely ambiguous ending, which will bring the reflection to all."
" Painful to watch, but unforgettable for its sheer strangeness
",2017-05-09 00:00:00,5,"This was definitely the strangest movie I have seen in a long time, maybe ever.It is not a particular good movie, and will you probably not be able to make much sense of it (I know I was not), but - given you actually manage to sit through it - you will definitely remember it, and probably tell other people about it.Does that make it a good movie? I don't think so. But if you want to see something really strange and different, unlike anything you ever saw before, it might be worth investing the time - even if it runs more than two hours, we never really got the urge to turn it off while watching it, since every time we were in danger to get bored, the movie got even stranger, making us watch in baffled disbelief as the bizarre story unfolded.5/10. Would definitely not watch again, but do not regret watching either."
" Wonderful and Weird
",2017-05-06 00:00:00,8,"The Lobster is one of the weirdest films that you'll ever see in your life. It is not a film for everyone. This film brings an emotion out of you. It is a much-needed break from the usual Hollywood films that we see. The script is written by Yorgos and you can see his trademark(Dogbooth). It is a very different film, which is not for everyone, but it also shows that independent filmmaking is still alive."
" My favorite film of 2015 and 2016!
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,"Wow what a great film that was completely overlooked by all of the American Award shows, most likely because it's a British production with no American funding. Colin Farrell's best performance to date, iconic to me, I have seen this film five times and find it amazing every time. If you love Black Comedies this film is for you. It's rare to find a film like this the has a fabulous 3rd act.. this film does. Give it chance!"

" So weird, so alive and dead at the same time, and a bit too violent
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,7,"This movie is as weird as a camel in a forest. It has you figuring out what's really going on, whether the people get interned in the hotel by choice or by law, for a long time. The polite service and the pretty surroundings of the hotel create a stark contrast with the many rules, mandatory activities, psychological abuse and draconian measures. The matter of fact proceedings and dialogues, the ready acceptance of horrible circumstances contrast with the insanity of the system and the mental anguish the people must feel. Expressions of emotions are usually deliberately subdued, which exacerbates the surreal experience for the audience. Figuring out the world depicted in that movie is as much fun as trying to understand why it was constructed this way. Did Yorgos Lanthimos write the whole thing as a hyperbole to actual life? Is uncovering the hypocrisy of the hotel owners relationship a central message, is the mad search for a common ""defining"" characteristic something he really thinks is happening in the world or is it an analogy for something else? If you watch this movie with an open mind, it will stay with you for a long time, which is one of the most valuable characteristics available.The acting performances are universally great, although the absence of displayed emotion creates a slightly skewed measurement of course.Heightened spoiler alert...I'd love to give this movie more than 7/10, but I can't do that for two reasons. First one is unnecessary graphic violence. To show the still frame of a dog (that's actually a person) who has been kicked to death, for a perceived 5 seconds, is just bad taste, nothing else. Showing the bloody shin of the women is more than enough. It makes little to no sense for Lea Seydoux to have Rachel Weisz kill the former hotel maid. Driving home the point that the heartless woman has no heart can be done less painful than having a suicidal woman scream for an eternity while she bleeds to death. The second reason is the beginning and the ending. It's just too easy to let the audience hanging, I think in most movies an inconclusive ending is just a cheap shot at extending the previously mentioned effect of it sticking in your mind. The same goes for the unexplained and deliberately enigmatic beginning."
" Fails Bechdel test. Fails Race Test. Pointless animal cruelty.
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,1,"This movie fails the Bechdel. Watching this movie with the Bechdel test in mind, it honestly felt like this movie intentionally failed. There are plenty of times when women spoke to each other about things other than men, but none of the characters were named. I realize this was sort of a humorous aspect of this movie as most of the cast wasn't named but rather called things like ""Room 187"" or ""biscuit woman"". But the three main male roles were actually named, and even the main character's DOG had a name. It reached a level of absurdity when not long after the men introduced themselves by name, female characters said ""let me introduce you to my best friend"" without saying any names. This movie fails the race test. There were only a couple black actors and none of their characters were ever brought into the plot in any substantial way. This movie passes the Gay test on a technicality since the main character clearly would check the bisexual box on a form if that was an option. But this was never actually fleshed out as he only ever expressed romantic interest in female characters.The movie was also unnecessarily cruel to animals. You will not see the ""no animals were harmed in the making of this film"" at the end of the credits.The trailer made it seem like this would be a fun quirky movie. It was far from that."
" This movie makes no sense
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,2,"It has no logic in it's story line what so ever ! I've pressed submit my review and and I see that I must use 5 lines to tell you how bad it was. I've lost 2 hours watching it and hoping for a great ending or at least for some explanation but that did't happen. I guess this movie was made for the critics, not the ordinary consumers, and I'm not a movie critic. Great actors tho !"
" The F was that?
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,1,"I am sure the story has come from some really interesting conversation that the screenwriters had had once, (I imagine them as people complaining how the dating scene in the world sucks) but I don't think they had delivered it on the screen. What a waist of time. If you are not one of those people that pretend they are somehow deep, then do not see it, or at least lower down your expectation. The music was good though."
" Disturbingly bad
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,1,"Disgusting movie. Propped up by the pseudo intellectual critics of the film festivals who's primary aim is to try and appear smart in front of a sea of retards also trying to appear smart. This movie literally made me nauseous. There is a hellish Hitler's Spawn of a scene where a woman describes how she brutally murders a dog and then they actually show the dead dog with its gut kicked out on the bathroom floor. That image was shown for at least 3 seconds and will haunt me for life. The movie is so bleak and dark and disturbed that no form of entertainment can possibly be derived from this by anyone other than those paid, posing, and pretending to see the ""life message"". The life message is that this is total sh*t. Applauded by sh*t. And sold by sh*t. And no one should be subjected to this. Avoid. Tell people to avoid. And seek accountability for this utter assault and rape. I don't use those words loosely. I haven't felt more violated and angered by a film since the repulsive The Killer Inside Me. And even that was a cakewalk in comparison."
" Avoid at all cost!
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,1,"Pseudo intellectual masturbation, a sick and disgusting combination of violence, twisted and heartless. 2 hours of unnecessary depressive state. As some people find God anywhere just""because"",some people will find art in this piece of garbage. I personally would rather prefer to watch a traditional horror movie that scares but leaves my conscience in piece,than to feel sick and depressed. If you would like to experience mental illness and psychiatric sensations you could give it a shot.By far the worst film I've ever seen.I should claim my 2 wasted hours back from the director."
" The absurdity of modern relationships.
",2017-03-23 00:00:00,8,"4 / 5 - I enjoyed this film more than I was expecting to enjoy it. I think the first half of the film is way better than the second one, that drags for too long a little bit. The film is a great example of absurd storytelling to magnify little aspects of our lives. It is through the lens of the absurdity that we will exam relationship in our modern society. In this dystopian near future all single people are forced to go through a 45 day process to find a romantic partner or they will be transformed into beasts and sent off into the woods. It is quite a simple premise and through this we are forced to reflect how we see relationships and our own image projected to society. In the movie, characters are described through one single feature, and they need to find a match on this singularity on another person in order to form a couple. It is interesting how this, which should simplify everything, actually make things even trickier. And how much absurd is this when we also dictate specific features that we look on other people and if someone is far off our standards we usually won't relate to the person at all?The film itself is good, great shots, photography, acting, soundtrack (including a Nick Cave mention). Recommended."
" The right to choose not to choose
",2017-03-21 00:00:00,7,"Yorgos Lanthimos delves deeper into his realm of weirdness to portrait in ""The lobster"" one of the most shocking, distressing and yet meaningful dystopian future the industry of cinema has thrown at us in decades. Does one really have the right to choose when he is denied the right to choose not to choose?No room for singles in this dystopian city out of Lanthimos' mind. No rights for them but a last chance to fix their malfunction, to set themselves right and find a partner. After all, there's no safe stroll without a partner, no dinner without risks without a partner, no being human without a partner. Its either marriage or a trip back to being an animal.But it is not just the oppressive atmosphere of the re-educating hotel Lanthimos crafts the best. It is the demonizing of both sides he delivers with utmost skill, showing no right choice but two opposite views stubbornly and cruelly carried through no matter the consequences. David must pick a side knowing both are wicked and wrong, and with all certainty that none will end well for him.Farrel delivers a great performance, topping an all around good performance from the whole cast.It is perhaps the subtle cruelty beneath all the glamour and glitter, the non-graphic violence delivered through oppressive peer pressure and witty dialogue that surprises the most and makes ""The lobster"" so enjoyable. Yorgos excels once again at his social criticism, but manages to wrap it in a well packed film that will unsettle most but disturb none."
" Shallow absurdist ""comedy""
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,3,"Apparently it is fashionable to take a bizarre premise, preferably involving a humorous animal, and spin out the consequences without regard for logic or reason, even though the characters behave as if they had no choice but to follow the ""logic"" of the situation. While superficially similar to Wes Anderson's films, this movie is no where near the quality of Anderson's films. Anderson's movies use a cartoon world to emphasize the humanity of the characters. This movie creates characters that operate by cartoon logic in an all too real appearing world. No humanity, a few humorous scenes, and a lot of gratuitous violence. The characters teach us nothing. Watching this movie was like being trapped in the nightmare of a very sick writer. Even the violence felt contrived - which is all the more disturbing.Skip it. Life is too short."
" Novel idea...and that's all
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,3,"Set in a dystopian, fascist future, single people are sent to a hotel where they must find a partner in 45 days or get turned into a wild animal of their choice. David's wife has just left him, after 11 years of marriage, and he is sent the hotel. His chosen animal, should he not find a partner, is a lobster.Quite intriguing, initially. The whole idea and set up was so inane you felt compelled to stick with it. The sheer novelty of it all sucks you in.However, almost as quickly, the cracks in the concept and plot start to appear. Why do people go along with the preposterous idea? If they are forced to find a partner, why not just find anyone and pretend to be a couple, rather than suffer this fate? While obviously the central idea is quite ridiculous, it is the way people respond to it that is truly implausible and sets the movie up to fail.Also, why does the opposite of this ""couples are everything"" regime have to be a ""being a perpetual loner is the only way to go"" group. Surely there can be a middle ground? The extreme polarity of it all was irritating. Despite these flaws, however, there was a chance this could develop into an interesting drama. I figured I was happy to overlook these obvious faults if the movie got some momentum. Alas, no, it just gets worse and worse. From a point the plot just becomes very random and, ultimately, pointless.Only worth watching if you're curious to know what all the fuss is about, but be prepared to be disappointed."
" Don't be fooled by the high rating
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,2,Don't be fooled by the high rating. It doesn't deserve more than 5 stars; 5 stars just for the scenes and views. Boring and very long just to say a simple sentence about the society. You can make a 15 minutes short film just to make the same point. It is not a comedy at all. I didn't see anything to make me even smile.
" Unique but slightly disappointing
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,8,"Yorgos Lanthimos has the great virtue of looking at our modern world with great insight and dissecting it for us. He turns the insight into a metaphor, and presents the freakishness of our society in essence, for what it is, not or what we've come to accept as normal. In this film, Lanthimos reflects on the pressures that single people have to endure in our society: why are you single? why haven't you married yet? You should date and mate a person like you (meaning, your own social class, race, country, tribe, religion, age, etc.). You should allow somebody else to decide what's best for you (your parents, the group, or the algorithm of a dating site). You shouldn't (mustn't) have sexual relationships with your partner until you marry, or you should have meaningless sexual contacts until you marry. All of those things are societal and cultural, not natural, they treat the single person as an object to manipulate. All of this pressure and questions are analyzed in the film but with a detached mind, masterly, so you might ask, what has this to do with reality? The answer is everything! This is an intellectualizing exercise about reality, the reality of being single in the present day and world. The script is very original -- unique. The actors are all good in their roles, especially having into account the material they've been given. The mood is also great; there is this 70s sort of vintage cold vibe that really suits the story. Some of the scenes in the film are great, as well; my favorite ones being the getaways of the singles to the city, the visit to the supermarket, the flamingo in the middle of the forest, or the group of singles taming their libido with dance music in the middle of the forest. You might find others more of your liking. There are plenty of odd scenes, dialogues and images, some of them really gory, and not my taste, but really impacting. A few things annoyed me in the film, and most of them come from the direction and the script. 1/ I can appreciate the intellectual exercise, but I wasn't able to empathize with any of the characters. The script didn't take me from my head to my heart; a frigid world with frigid characters, even those supposedly in love. I couldn't care about them, unfortunately. 2/ The script is too rigid. The actors had no permission to improvise and develop their characters, something that would have give them depth and humanity. The actors were repeating sentences as robots, and that was what felt like. I'm sure that is intentional but, again, if you don't touch my heart, I won't give a dam about the story. 3/ There are a lot of outdoor scenes in the film, yet the cinematography is grim and alien-like. I thought of the way the forest was incorporated into the story of Fahrenheit 451; the forestry and city in this film are not hostile or beautiful, more flat than anything else. I found they lacked on cinematographic and narrative treatment to incorporate them into the story. It might be intentional, but it didn't work for me. 4/ I was expecting dark deadpan humour and found deadpan horror, so that was a bit of slap on the face; the horror took me aback, and I didn't find enough funny elements, more absurd and grotesque ones. This is one of those films rarely produced in English, certainly an European film because I find difficult to imagine a film like this being produced in the US: elitist, daring, merciless and ruthless. Unique film-making for sure, mentally satisfying, but also disappointing and emotionally frigid to me."
" Appalling and vile.
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,1,"A film that ought to ooze charm, wit and menace – instead The Lobster, complete with its ludicrous plot, is extremely heavy-handed, and due to gratuitous scenes of animal cruelty, repellent. The stilted dialogue implies a disingenuous subservience to a pervasive totalitarianism. It is as convincing as the overdubbed voice-tracks on early 1970s German sex comedies. The standard of acting is no better – Farrell and Weisz sleepwalk and procrastinate unnecessarily throughout the movie. The production values are non-existent – whatever budget the director had available was clearly spent on renting a hotel for a day or two and hiring the cast. A cast that that largely appear to regret ever becoming involved in this train crash of a film. The Lobster is desperate to both unsettle and amuse. Excepting a kitsch performance of Something's Gotten Hold of My Heart by the hotel managers, there are no smiles. Animal cruelty aside, this film is less disturbing – and not as credible - as Santa Claus Conquers The Martians. Unsurprisingly, the ending is abrupt and unfathomable; no doubt designed to seed speculation and debate on internet forums. The film would love to be Kafkaesque. Orwellian, even. It dreams of being Terry Gilliam's Brazil. But The Lobster is not even poor man's science fiction. No self-respecting art house cinema should even consider screening this drivel. No thrift store should accept unwanted DVD and Blu Ray copies of this utter tosh.There are online sci-fi shorts with more imagination, flair and purpose than The Lobster. It is an absolute waste of celluloid. It is two hours of your life that you will not get back."
" Still a lot more to do
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,4,"Mr Lanthimos and his associates have pulled through a rather difficult theme. The challenge is accepted and undertaken by all the parties and people involved. Technically and aesthetically the film is good - there is a compelling atmosphere and this applies to every aspect of the film. I can think of a couple of filmmakers from the 80s that could have been an influence. Still my idea is there are a lot more to be told. The ending of the film confirms my belief, it is a new beginning."
" Quirky and Dark
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,2,"I imagine the only reason this was made was due to the very quirky script that attracted Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz. Two names that can carry enough weight to get a script made into a movie. The premise is well known so I won't get into it here. Suffice to say that this was billed as a dark comedy and although I can agree with the dark part, it was not really comedy. I laughed out loud only once but did chuckle a few times here and there. Mostly I wondered why this was made as much more deserving scripts are out there looking for producers and funding so why waste money on this crap. It is nominated for an Academy Award for screenplay due to it being completely outside the box. The producers thought they could find an audience as it is different. I really hope this one doesn't win anything. It does not deserve to be rewarded."
" A Bleak View
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,4,"I'm not usually a fan of dystopian films, but this one reminded me more of 1984 than anything else I've seen. I was drawn in right from the beginning, and for a good while, I was happily along for the ride. There was an offbeat sense of humor that I appreciated. However, I felt like it lost focus and went in a direction it didn't need to go to make its point. My interest started to wane as the movie went on and I saw where it was going. What was fun about the early sequences is you start to learn the rules of this world bit by bit as it unfolds. If this movie is commenting on the need for approval to be a couple in today's society, it sure meandered a lot to get there."
" A Truly Original Gem
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,10,"The Lobster is one of those films that comes along every few years that truly amazes me. Not only for its originality, but also for its ability to make me rethink certain aspects of my life. This film is a breath of fresh air amidst recent titles I've seen in the last few weeks. I only have one flaw of The Lobster; some slow motion sequences seem to go on a little too long. This is extreme nit picking in a film with a great screenplay, stellar performances (John C. Reiley was a hilarious contribution), solid direction to display the mood of the film and above all else, a great satirical look at love and relationships."
" What is this?
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,1,"Absurd. Pointless. Meaningless. No sense. Choose your word to described this weird film. It goes on and on in the absurd as pass the minutes. It is difficult to understand how that good cast get involved in this awful creation. One of the stranger, boring and ridiculous film I have ever seen. Do not waste your time expecting at least a standard ending."
" Dreadfully dull, unnecessarily cruel.
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,1,"I knew going in that this show would be quirky, perhaps weird, and it certainly was that. What I didn't expect, however, was the cruelty of this show, and the mean-spirited nature of it. I won't go into details, but if you love animals, give this a wide berth, though I'm sure that no animal cruelty actually took place. The whole movie was way too long, and dragged on interminably. The second half in particular was incredibly boring and pointless. Give it a miss - that's nearly two hours of my life I'm never getting back!"
" A terrifying dystopia created by the brilliant Yorgos Lanthimos
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,10,"One of 2016's most unique and bizarre films is the pitch-black comedy, ""The Lobster"". Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, an idiosyncratic Greek 'angry young man' filmmaker who had previously garnered both praise and excoriation with his 2009 Oscar-nominated ""Dogtooth"", this provocative and uncompromising surrealist masterpiece is set in a dystopian near-future in which only couples are allowed to survive. If any unfortunate citizen should become single through divorce or death, they are given 45 days to find a new mate to marry or are punished by being transformed into an animal and released into the woods. The one silver lining in this dark cloud is that each unsuccessful single gets to choose which animal. A lobster is the bizarre choice of our protagonist, an emotionally scarred architect named David, brilliantly played by Colin Farrell with a perennial deer-in-the-headlights expression. Rachel Weisz is the woman with whom he forms a bond in the film's second half when he fatefully falls into a group of rebels who have made it illegal to couple.Almost universally lauded by critics for being a razor-sharp satire of societal templates examining sexual mores and the desperately sad world of single dating, ""The Lobster"" is also a moving if unconventional love story rooted in the theater of the absurd, a Kafkaesque fable that perfectly combines Swiftian wit with Mozartian elegance as, in the words of one critic, ""it opens (one's) eyes to a new way of storytelling."" It is rare cinematic caviar for both the eyes and the mind of the most discriminating. As to the film's fastidiously luxurious visual style, Lanthimos seems the successor to Stanley Kubrick -- but as if the director of ""A Clockwork Orange"" had mated with a scorpion.Although it won the Jury Prize at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, many will not like this film. Samuel Beckett would have. I've seen it half a dozen times, each time loving it more. For the discerning few, this will be one of the most memorable cinematic experiences of recent years. For the rest, they can keep waiting for Godot."
" The Lobster
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,6,"I had heard about this film on a film review programme, then again when Awards Season came along, I was obviously intrigued by the title, it had a good cast list, and the nominations got my interest, I was looking forward to it. Basically in an absurd near dystopian future, according to the laws of The City, single people will be arrested and transferred to The Hotel, a creepy place similar to an expensive spa. There people have 45 days to find a suitable partner, or they will be turned into an animal of their choosing, there they follow strict rules: masturbation is banned, sexual stimulation by the hotel maid is mandatory, and guests attend dances and watch propaganda explaining the advantages of partnership. David (Golden Globe nominated Colin Farrell) discovers his wife (Rosanna Hoult) has left him for another man, now single he is arrested and taken to The Hotel, his brother who became single has already been turned into a dog, the most common animal choice for people, David chooses to become a lobster, because of their cycle of life and his love for the sea. At the hotel, David makes acquaintances with a Limping Man (Ben Whishaw) and a Lisping Man (John C. Reilly), while many of the female residents try to persuade him to become their partner, including a Biscuit Woman (Ashley Jensen) and Nosebleed Woman (Jessica Barden). To have a compatible relationship, partners are required to have a distinguishing traits in common, and to extend their deadlines, residents can hunt and tranquillise single people hiding in the forest, a captured ""loner"" earns them a day. Many residents however are trying to end their stay at the hotel by faking traits, for example John constantly smashes his nose to to have nosebleeds like that of the female resident, the Hotel Manager (Olivia Colman) moves them to the couples section and gives them a month- long trial partnership, David decides to attempt a relationship with a notoriously Heartless Woman (Angeliki Papoulia), who has tranquillised more loners than anyone else. While in the couples' suite, David pretends to enjoy her cruel behaviour, including gaining her interest pretending to enjoy the biscuit- loving woman severely injuring herself jumping from a window, but he is broken-hearted when she finds she has kicked her brother (in dog form) to death, she decides they are not a match. The heartless woman drags him to the hotel manager to face punishment, to be turned into an animal no-one likes, but he is able to escape with the help of the sympathetic Maid (Ariane Labed), while his partner is tranquillised and transformed into an unspecified animal. Escaping the hotel, David finds the loners and their Leader (Skyfall's Léa Seydoux) in the woods, they themselves follow rules that contrast those of the hotel, masturbation is permitted, but romance is forbidden, with mouth mutilation as punishment, the maid is in fact a mole for the loners, aiding them to sabotage the hotel. Now joined with the loners, they launch a mini-raid on the hotel, during which David reveals to the nosebleed woman that John has been faking, the other loners hold the hotel manager and her husband at gunpoint, the husband is tricked into shooting his wife to save himself, but the gun is not loaded, the couple are left to face each other. David, who is shortsighted, finds a strong connection with loner member the Short Sighted Woman (Rachel Weisz), they begin a secret relationship, developing gestural code to communicate, but eventually their affections are discovered by the leader in the shortsighted woman's journal, as well as their plan to escape. The leader takes the shortsighted woman to the city, to have an operation to cure her shortsightedness, but this is in fact a punishment, she is blinded instead, in anger the woman accidentally kills the maid, thinking she is killing the leader. She tells David about her blindness, this means they no longer have anything in common, despite his efforts to find something, he says they will figure it out, and they will continue their plan to escape. David overpowers the leader, tying her up and leaving her to be eaten by dogs, he and the blind woman escape the city, stopping at a restaurant, David seeks to reestablish commonality, he prepares to blind himself in the bathroom with a steak knife, while the blind woman waits for him at the table. Also starring Michael Smiley as Loner Swimmer, Roger Ashton-Griffiths as Doctor and The Office's Ewen MacIntosh as Trainer Waiter - Shooting Range. The cast all give great performances, the story is wonderfully bizarre, a world where being a relationship is a matter of a life or death, many other fearsomely strange things are at foot as well, including characters speaking completely honestly about everything, including sex and desire, it is beautifully shot, and the script is fantastically sharp, funny and satirical, as a movie it is an acquired taste, but it is a most watchable and interesting dystopian science-fiction black comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best British Film. Good!"
" Trainwreck to be avoided at all costs
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,1,"The man who stole too much of my time with Dogtooth brings another pretentious, opaque, joyless, obnoxious film that enlists live human actors to play the parts of non-humans who don't act like people, to make a statement about nothing (how can it be about anything if the people live in a world that operates off vapid conceits that don't pertain in the slightest to how live humans actually live), but of course critics laud as genius work. Avoid at all costs."
" A puzzle that may or may not be worth figuring out
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,6,"As everyone has clearly stated this film is weird. I was not familiar with the film when it popped up on Amazon. I checked it out solely because I enjoy Rachel Weiss....how bad could it be?Bad isn't the word for this film. Rather, confused. I think you spend the majority of the time during the initial watching trying to figure out WHY the heck the things you are watching are happening. Its a strange world and about 2/3s of the film feels like like watching a puzzle slowly take shape.When you finally figure out the why, things get even odder. The motivations of the main characters become something of a complete mystery--why do they return to the hotel to torment their former 'friends'? Why do they feel the need to venture to town? Why does the lead character feel he must make the choice he faces in the mirror? Its a weird turn for someone who appears to have come to reject the rules of both communities represented in the film.I guess the big theme the film wrangles with is how society forces a narrative on our lives and how people brainwash themselves to fit into those stories. An interesting twist is how whether one choose the mainstream story or the rebel/alternative story, either one requires an individual to brainwash and contort themself into an psychological pretzel. The commentary about relationships embedded in the film is rather chilling but rings a bit true. Altbeit its a bit much to think of a world where being single is the most aberrant thing a person could opt for. Perhaps a second watching may help with puzzling the whys out, but its a rather slow movie and I have yet to devote the time and attention to trying to sort out the subtle themes. I am not sure I will take a stab at it again, but its a curious enough film that I am tempted."
" Goofy and dull
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,3,"Even after the obligatory head-scratching from the confusing opening (and the usual, modern day mumbling mix of poor speech delivery and horribly mixed background sound and music), this film just takes too much getting used to. Some of the tres-noir humor is quite funny, but mostly lost in the flat affects and depressing absurdity. I recently saw an excellent local production of ""Waiting for Godot,"" and it was downright light-hearted compared to this. After ten minutes I was saying ""got it,"" and not sure why I sat through the rest. To what depths goes sarcastic satire? Apparently endless."
" An absurdist black comedy about society's obsessive mating rituals.
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,8,"To appreciate a film like The Lobster (2015) you need to know something about absurdism and dystopia. Whether we recognise it or not, our brains are wired into binary sets that help us make sense of the world. For example: in fictional narrative we tell stories about being unloved in order to express our need for love; we portray the fearful 'them' in order for 'us' to feel safe; and we explore the depths of 'evil' to celebrate what is 'good'. Absurdist films take these inversions of logic to their extreme in order to make us question the world we take for granted. They often add black comedy and dystopian/chaotic themes as a way of messing with our minds and challenging the foundations of our reality.If you are still reading this, you will recognise The Lobster as an absurdist dystopian essay. It is a story set in a place referred to as The City where coupledom is compulsory and being single is illegal. If anyone becomes un-coupled they are immediately incarcerated in The Hotel where they have 45 days to re-couple or they will be transformed into an animal of their choice. Most of the unnamed people we meet are referred to by a defining characteristic, except for our protagonist, recently widowed architect David (Colin Farrell). The inmates must participate in dancing to bland music and attend lectures about the evils of being single. They are only allowed to leave the hotel to join hunts in the forest. If they shoot escaped loners they earn extra time before being turned into an animal.In this rule-bound parallel universe everyone wears the same clothes and everything is hyper- regulated. When rules are broken punishment is severe: one victim has his fingers jammed into a burning toaster at breakfast for everyone to see. The forest world is the opposite to the The City. Escaped loners enjoy cool music and dance, but must stay single and any physical contact is forbidden. As his time runs out in The Hotel, David fears that he will fail to couple and flees to join the loners. As fate would have it, he meets his love amongst them and must sneak back into city life.What to make of this strange tale? Despite its all-star cast, conventional acting criteria seem irrelevant as performances are understated and almost expressionless. The filming palette in The Hotel is blandly desaturated while that for the forest is richly foreboding, making both feel unwelcome. There are no flashbacks or other cinematic devices that offer insight into why things are the way we see them. We are left then with the classic absurdist challenge: to find meaning in this film you must turn logic on its head.If you reflect on how much of our lives are focused on preparation for love and marriage, and how much real-world capitalist consumption is obsessed with beauty, sex appeal, and appearances, the absurd inverted metaphors of The Lobster begin to make sense. The City is not that different to romance TV reality shows where contestants hunt for mates based on defining characteristics. The real question is why are loners ostracised and why is there such pressure on finding partners? In the real world, I mean."
" Can you spoil something so awful? *spoilers*
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,1,"**** spoilers**** Where to start with this pathetic combination of Von Trier and Wes Anderson. Pointless, juvenile, pointlessly cruel and just DUMB. Moronic premise that the unattached are forced to find mates or be turned into a lower species? Perfect matches are only found with similar weakness? A limp or bad eyes? Gaping plot holes, like asking which partner would be better off alone when the whole point of the film is that they CAN'T be left alone? Would be forced to re-couple or die. the mystery ending that's there why? The moronic idea that both partners being blind would somehow not end them both? They could only be together if they both shared blindness? That they would openly make out in the home of the leader's parents? I am AMAZED that this turd has a 7 rating. I could go on for about the length of the film as to why you shouldn't waste your time."
" If only you could rate it a negative number
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,1,"I will start with what I actually liked. The end credits were amazing,I was so thrilled that this pathetic excuse for a movie was finally over. I can't remember the last time I was so grateful to see 113 minutes of pure misery come to an end. That should sum it up.First of all, I have no idea what I was supposed to gather from this sorry movie. It seemed so promising, since singledom and relationships are a recurrent theme in today's society. What looked like an intriguing idea - the stigmatization of single people - took a sudden turn for the absolute worst. At this point in the movie, which is maybe 20-30 minutes in, the director decided it was a good idea to add a bunch of random elements, so that by the end of it everyone felt confused and as if they wasted their time. And boy, was that so. On one hand you have some delusional, closed minded people, who throw communist parties and force others to form a couple, or else they are turned into animals. On the other side you have a gang of sworn single, sadist hipsters who engage in equally aberrant activities. In short, whoever made this movie abused stereotypes on either side to the point of absolute confusion. It's dumb to be in a relationship because you clearly started from false pretenses and it's equally useless to be single because you'll either become mentally ill or fall in love and therefore fall in the first category. Second of all, it wanted to be such a quirky, progressive and abstract movie, and yet it got trapped in the most basic and boring stereotypes. In no particular order: the man on the journey to find happiness, the man pretending to be something he's not to fit in, the man falling trap to human nature, the pretty and dumb woman, the desperate woman with a distinct habit and the list can go on.Furthermore, what is with the director and animal cruelty? If he's got that kind of issues, he should see a psychiatrist and not make movies. But maybe he did that to divert attention from how obnoxious his movie was, hoping that viewers will think something other than what a waste of time it was.I have noticed this movie is a comedy. Yes, the way it trashed what could have been a thought provoking piece of art is indeed laughable. It's a shame really. As a conclusion, I can assure you everything else you might want or have to do is better than this movie. Even a rom com or an adaptation of some John Green book will leave you with a sweeter taste in your mouth."
" Painful
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,2,"At the beginning, weird but OK. Then I just was making an effort to see, and then finally I fell asleep two times. Not a comedy, nor a drama, just a waste of time. Sincirely this movie is very bad, and not even Colin Farrell with a great performance could save it. I love Rachel Weisz and felt she was okay.The story was somewhat interesting, in a parallel reality kind of way,but it was too boring. The story line had everything to be a good movie, I understood the lack of emotions on one hand, and the beginning of love story.This is the word that defines this movie...boring. I'm sorry but I have to say it again....boring."
" A contemporary must see
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,9,"The purpose of this film is not to tell a straight forward story or an well know or mediumly talked subject, or even to teach a social message.This film is a description of a world that can be called extreme or fantasious by our actual standards (and im being soft because our actual world can be worst) but i think is not supposed to convince us that our world is like that, or should be like that. Of course, filmed in common scenario, including well know actors performing in real locations, can lead us to think that it telling us a story of today, but it isn't, and i think thats were some people didn't like it.The best way to look at this movie is like seeing a duck decoy, of course, it doesn't cuack, it doesn't fly, it doesn't swim, because it is not supposed to be a real duck even if it looks like one; however, in the job of atraccting ducks by using a well crafted piece of wood and high skill painting, its wonderful and works great.Finally and talking about the actors and goriness or if, i think that particular ingredients are the directors view of how to tell this particularly story, and in my opinion their impact is well fitted to the kind of story hes tryng to tell."
" A very good idea, but somewhat poorly executed
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,6,"An absurdist comedy that brushes into the weirdness of social pressure regarding relationships (and being single). The movie has it's moments, mixing disturbing moments with dark humour, using clear and not-so-clear allegories to illustrate basic human needs such as love, sex and acceptance, and how we reinvent ourselves in order to try to find a partner. Also, it offers funny and disturbing insights on the great pressure society makes in this area. However, the excess of the absurd in the human relations tend to make them over simplistic and not human at all. Therefore, there are several ocasions where the movie could have better explored the complexities and subtleties of the theme within relationships, but didn't, for being over simplistic. At the end of the movie you get the sensation It didn't really get anywhere that made some sense, and that the basic idea of the script could have been much better executed"
" I wanted to love this but it felt a bit bland.
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,3,"I love the premise of this movie, a black comic look at how the modern world has made us all terribly lonely. Fearful that we end up unmarried and childless (let alone what other people would think!) we would be reduced back to a more primitive form. It's like natural selection meets tinder. You can't knock the performances of this fantastic cast either. Lots of internal characterisations which just emulated from Colin Farrell's facial expressions and made you feel truly awkward with him. He felt utterly tortured. But overall, it was just a bit dull and I got a bit bored. Maybe it went a step to far with it's satire and I got distracted. Would have made a good 'Black Mirror' episode but there was something missing from this as a feature length film. Which is a real shame because with a bit more backstory that the viewer could relate to I think it could have been a standout indie classic."
" Might be the best movie of the year
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,10,"The Lobster is about as quirky as they come; a surreal deadpan depiction of some alternate universe or perhaps our future (I'm not sure which the filmmakers were leaning towards) in which partnership is a legal requirement and to be alone is to be a lesser being. It's a story billed as dystopian, but with the complexity and sophistication that this civilization is run, perhaps our heroes who work to fight the system are merely traitors.The opening scene depicts a woman driving down a country road and then exiting her car to calmly shoot and kill a donkey in a field. Having completed this movie, one wonders what this donkey could have possibly done done to deserve it. We learn the processes and meanings later. In the simplest description, this is a society in which people who are single (whether due to death or divorce) must refuge in a sort of resort for loners, a large hotel in which newly-single folk must meet like-minded people in order to mate and return to society. Assuming you can't find a companion within 30 days of arriving, you are turned into an animal of your choice and released into the wild, forever doomed to be mute and alone.David is our protagonist (a deadpan Colin Farrell, he's fantastic) who enters the resort with his brother (a yappy dog, transformed by the same resort 4 years prior) after his wife leaves him for another man with glasses. He is given a single room, 4 complete suits, shoes, and instructions to never use the volleyball or tennis courts. Those are reserved for couples. He eats all 3 meals at an individual table (curious since socialization is the key to meeting others), attends stiff formal dances catered by the building managers, and regularly goes in groups to the nearby woods to hunt loners who have escaped the grounds.The story indeed makes for one of the most unique pieces of cinema I have ever seen. The tone is that of a black comedy, and humor is found not in actions or situations, but rather the curious nature of these characters. They speak in a simple English, and there is a bleak sound to it. David speaks with a textbook-like vernacular. He never laughs, never yells, and seems content with living out his remainder as a human in relative peace.Not only do our characters require a mate, but they also must settle down with someone of a similar trait. A fellow exile picks a woman who frequently gets nosebleeds and insists that banging his head on the table to cause a drip from his nose will make them a perfect couple. Another unsuccessfully tries to find a woman with a similar lisp to his.One thing leads to another, and David escapes to join a band of loners in the nearby woods (the loners hunted every night). There he falls in love with a short-sighted woman (Rachel Weisz in one of her best roles). How curious that David is also short-sighted, and how deeply sad that these foresters forbid relationships as a form of rebellion to society.Yorgos Lanthimos is the director and co-writer, Greek in descent and with a decidedly European sensibility to his film. His work, while challenging, concludes on a note that will leave some audiences confused and others amazed by the simplicity of it. Along with ""Her,"" here is another modern film that works to dissect love and relationships in a way that we have not yet seen before. There is much to discuss about the film, and there is even more to debate. It's one of the very best films this year."
" Couldn't stand this movie.
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,5,"Contains spoilers.First, I'm a fan of quirky films, indie movies, and stuff that's generally non- mainstream (in addition to regular mainstream stuff like Star Wars or whatnot), so I was curious about this film from the trailer. I get that this film is a satire about finding true love, including a host of other interesting ethical questions, but in doing so it tries to be as off-putting as possible, as if to say ""only smart people will make it through this film."" In essence, it's a pompous movie. I've seen plenty of smart, challenging films that don't insult the audience by showing how smart the director or writer is.From the get go, you're going to be watching long-takes, which is fine, I love well-composed shots, except the shots and cinematography in this film are not particularly interesting nor well-composed.You're also going to have to sit through a first hour of dialogue that's delivered so stilted (for the sake of satire) you'll wonder how these A-List actors could possibly be in a film that's acted worse than your first-grader's play.The film opens up a little after the halfway point and becomes more human, but it took everything for me to make it through that first hour. I'm just riffing here, but every line sounds and is delivered about as thinly as it's written below:""Would you like to have some tea?""Awkward pause.""Yes. I think I would like to have some tea. Thank you. That is very nice.""""You are welcome. I'm glad I can give you some tea that will make you happy.""""That is a very nice thing of you to say to me. I will remember that you are a kind person.""""At the hotel, here, we all try to be kind to each other. For if you do not have kindness, what else do you have.""Awkward pause.""Yes ...""Awkward pause.""... That is true. Okay. Then. I think it will be good if we kiss now.""""Very well. How would you like your kiss?""""I think on the lips. Thank you.""Awkward pause. They kiss for ten seconds.""It was nice to kiss you.""""You are welcome. I will go now.""""Okay.""It was nearly impossible for me to make it through the first act, let alone the first half film. The writer and director were trying to be too smart for their own good and in turn try their best to alienate the viewers to show their intelligence. I love smart movies, just not ones that purposefully try to tick me off as a mode of emotional engagement."
" Strange and Dark
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,1,"There were elements on this movie that did not need to be in it. For one, there was no need to bring up ""sexual orientation"" when Farrell was checking into his hotel nor was there any need to have any ambiguities suggested. There is no need to ruin a film with any such references especially when it is irrelevant to the remainder of the film. To whom does the director appeal?Moreover, there's no need for all the weird references to abnormal sex, such as doing it ""up the arse."" More so, the various sexual aspects of this film was so weird, disturbing, that if young teenagers watch they may be forever scarred.In all, the only sexy scene in the whole movie is a pretty girl (in bikini) doing backstrokes in a swimming pool. It was a nice respite, and sadly so brief, from the horrors this film embodies.That said, let's get on with the movie. When each guest checks into the hotel, they get to choose which animal they would like to be if they fail to find a mate - Farrell chooses he'd be a lobster if he's to be transformed to an animal. If there's any sense at all in the world, everyone would choose to be a porpoise or other high functioning animal and at least retain their minds. Instead, Farrell wants to be a lobster, others want to be ponies, parrots, etc. Dumb. To make it more weird and stupid, the mates that everyone wants to find must have similar characteristics - short-sighted for short-sighted, a limp for a limp. Things like that. And there's the incongruities throughout.For one, if the guests run away into the woods rather than be made an animal, they aren't even allowed to enjoy their freedom but enter a different kind of hell where any attraction and affection between themselves will result in mutilation. Such an inhuman trait for those who want to remain so.Then finally, at the end, there's too many unanswered questions - one must surmise how the young couple get by in their new condition - how do they get past the authorities - how do they get around safely - do they even survive exiting the restaurant?This movie in short is one of the dumbest, unsatisfying experiences I've ever had the misfortune to waste my life on. On the plus side, the cinematography was quite nicely done - could've taken off the ND filters and given the film more pleasant light but that's the director's prerogative I suppose."
" The odd becomes captivating
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,10,"When the movie begins, you'll quickly think: ""what am I seeing?"". But as you continue watching it, you will understand you are watching an incredible metaphor of the real world. You will have moments of silence, complemented with an original soundtrack, apparently moments of non-sense (you will realize later it totally makes sense) and Colin Farrell changing during the movie. After the movie, you will understand you are one of the characters everyday, when you wake up and go to work. It's a quite disturbing thought, as you will see the plot is quite twisted, but I would say it's an excellent portrait of nowadays and how the relationships are build. Highly recommended."
" ""Some excuses are without doubt, better than others...""
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,5,"Quite coincidentally and without aforethought, I started knocking down a few about a half hour before starting to watch this movie. I almost never do that, but in this case it was strangely apropos. Now I like quirky, and the first half of the movie, even though a lot of it was non-sensical, managed to elicit it's fair share of laughs from this viewer. But what I originally thought might have been daring and brilliant eventually just collapsed upon itself. It's got nothing on Monty Python, and the thing just wound up wearing me out. I was never so glad for any kind of ending to put this picture out of it's misery, no matter how stupid, and that's exactly what happened.However - the story had some great lines I'd like to highlight: ""I'm sorry I've got blood on your shirt."" ""Don't expect anyone else to dig your grave for you or carry your corpse."" ""You don't need to accept rabbits from other people."" And my personal favorite - ""You wouldn't want your face eaten by dogs, would you?"" I put that all in here so the reader knows at least that I was paying attention."
" Intriguing premise.....depressingly disappointing
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,2,"(Very minor spoilers)Sometime late 2016, I happened across a trailer for this strange looking film starring Colin Farrell. At its very basic, it is the story of a guy who goes to a hotel and he must find love in 45 days or he will be transformed into the animal of his choice...in this case, a lobster. It was very strange and the trailer implied that it would be comedy of sorts (Dark humor, maybe?) set in a world similar to ours but yet very different. I missed it when it came out in theaters and I have only just watched it via Red Box.There was one glaring question as I watched this film and after it was done: how did this film get all this praise (3rd place at Cannes, and nominated for Best Screenplay at the Academy Awards)? To hear/read the accolades and to listen to the cast and crew reminisce on how beautiful and thought provoking this film was...made me wonder if I am just not in tune with ""true art"". Maybe my rational brain is incapable of absorbing the nuances of the director's soft yet firm take on the love story. Yes, this supposedly a love story set to a dystopian dark comedy. A dark comedy it is not, not even the slightest snicker even dared to pass my lips the entire film. What did pass my lips was either a yawn or a demand for the film to ""get on with it!"" and stop dragging it's feet.Here is the main problem: the majority of the film possessed absolutely zero emotion. The only time anyone even gave a hint of human emotion was when something painful/traumatizing occurred to a character. The rest of the time they spoke like Ben Stien after taking too many depressants. The actors said that if they gave any emotion it would detract from the beauty of the script...I'm sorry, when Shyamalan characters have more natural sounding dialogue than you then there is a serious problem. It also doesn't help that the majority of the cast don't speak English as a primary language...or that this is the first English language film by this director!And what about the love story? It is more a story about what is love or how you know you are in love. In this film and the setting...love is finding someone who has a similar distinguishing characteristic to you regardless of true feelings. You have a limp, I have a limp...we are a perfect match! Yes, the ""love"" in this film is that absurd (not funny absurd, just depressingly sad absurd). And then you have the two societies in this film: the couples and the loners. The couples are the general population that forces everyone to strive toward partnership regardless of actual feelings. Concepts like individualism are oppressed and family is simply a product to help combat partner conflict. The loners are the ones living free in the woods to be individuals.....individuals that must live by the group's rules or suffer terrifying punishment on par with what the couples do. The film is absurd to the core. The characters are not at all realistic. The absurd dystopian society exists without rhyme or reason. The plot aimlessly drags on forever. And the ambiguously sudden ending left me shouting ""Thank God It's Over!"" rather than ""No! I want to know what happened!"" If you must see it, rent it for find a free copy. Spend as little money as you can on this ""film.""I give this film one steaming red lobster....straight into the trash can."
" Delightful experience
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,10,"It's not because I'm Greek, honestly, it's not. Or maybe it is, maybe there's something ingrained, some sort of deeply-rooted, ethnic support thing going on, I don't know.I choose to believe that it's because I haven't watched such a well-made black comedy in years.Because deadpan sarcasm speaks to me on a fundamental, primitive level.Because hyperrealism is a powerful medium that, when used in the right way, can successfully create a dream-layered utopia where logic diminishes into nothing but an unwelcome afterthought after it has graciously offered its place to a fantastical world of boundless possibilities. And this is what Lanthimos did for me – it broke down the social limits as I know them and challenged me to think, not farther, but deeper into my own being.Ultimately, the Lobster is an understated, dystopian love story that effortlessly made me laugh out loud while staring in its fun-house mirror of distortions — a claim not many movies can boast to have cast upon me.And more to the crucial point, it's the one bloody film I didn't find myself needing bloody subtitles to understand Colin bloody Farrell's insane bloody dialect."
" the first half was great, the second was just okay
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,8,"I am a huge fan of bizarre, black comedy, so the first half of this film was right up my ally. While the film's surreal sense of humor was still present in the second half of the film, it was not nearly as constant or even as funny as it had been. It's unfortunate that the second half of the film had to be so inferior, because I really wanted this movie to be great. However, after a while it got tedious and overly repetitive. Colin Farrell's character should have been developed a little more, the deadpan acting was very funny at first but became obnoxious by the end, and the 900th time the repetitive music score played I wanted to kill myself.This film is hilarious, unique, and visually stunning. Many of the characters are very original and entertaining, and I cared about most of the conflict. However, the film really could have been better with some tweaks to the script, better performances, and a stronger second half. I also felt that the film would have genuinely worked better as a novel-I just got that sort of vibe from it. Perhaps this shouldn't be a movie in the first place, but a great sci-fi book by the likes of Kurt Vonnegut or Ray Bradbury."
" Bland and Underwhelming
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,4,"As was the norm in 2016, The Lobster was yet another over-hyped film. Despite an intriguing premise and a stellar cast, the film never quite makes it past the limitations of Lanthimos' dour direction. Where a better film would have zigged or zagged, the director chooses a straight, gray-toned, dull classical path that fails to fully embrace the absurdity of the plot or connect the audience emotionally to the key points or characters of the film. And make no mistake, hidden in the dim lighting and few shooting locations is an interesting and striking critique of traditional relationship expectations. There's a few shots over the bow at traditional religious conceptions of marriage and some echoes of a dystopian future where the government controls who you love as well as a few strikes at the technological culture of isolation we find ourselves in today. But this never goes far. Lanthimos takes cues from Wes Anderson and from a number of successful French films but fails to catch the color and contrast of Anderson's worlds or the passion and expression found in films like Two Days, One Night. Where a change in color palate would have offered a symbolic contrast, Lanthimos continues to live in gray. Where a quirky beat could have changed a moment, Lanthimos presses play on the most boring classical soundtrack I have ever had the misfortune of listening to. Where a few shades of supporting characters could have poked and prodded at this alternative universe, Lanthimos chooses to force Seydoux and others into tight-lipped monotone commands and little else. And where the plot needed precision, Lanthimos refuses to allow clarity, which culminates in a weed-like storyline that can't seem to bring itself into focus. To top it off, the film is completely devoid of scope or establishing shots. It lacks the broad spectrum science- fiction control network and it's technocratic representation but also lacks the color and detail of Wes Anderson's surgical and hyper- limited absurdist set creations. And in perhaps the most damning moments, Lanthimos resorts to Zach Snyder levels of slow motion, an absolutely stunning mistake for a film so highly lauded. The slow motion kills moments of tension and cuts the legs out from moments so absurd they must be felt in real time. This is all such a shame. The themes of repression, isolation and control are so promising and Farrell and Weisz are more than game for their roles (Weisz in particular is practically begging to be allowed to express some of incredible emotional gravity she was allowed to portray in films like Constantine and others) but the director refuses to be swayed. The final death toll for The Lobster came as the ending just trickled to a close. It was ambiguous (not acceptable, given the quality of the previous acts) and as dreary and dour as the rest of the film. And while I accept that Lanthimos might just hate any and all relationships, hate is still a powerful emotion, something this film lacked entirely. Don't believe the hype for The Lobster, this is one film that doesn't have the legs this awards season."
" A totally fresh and original film
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,8,"Tired of seeing the same old boring drivel over and over again? Want to watch something new and original? Check out The Lobster. You will not be disappointed. This film feels totally fresh. It takes place in a world that looks similar to our own but which we soon discover is vastly different than anything any of us may have experienced. It's more like a strange dream or a nightmare, and every minute of it is full of fun.The story—which deals with a divorced man who is staying at a hotel where single people hope to meet a significant other or else be turned into an animal of their choosing—is totally unpredictable and leaves us on the edge of our seat in nervous anticipation. Then, halfway through, just when we think we know what's going to happen next, it takes a huge turn and we're off on the next leg of our adventure. Then it takes another turn and then another. It builds in excitement and intensity—and insanity—right up until the end, and before we know it the two hours have gone by in what feels like half the time. And the ending is amazing. I didn't even see it coming until thirty seconds beforehand and I couldn't help but smile as it unfolded.The characters and the story are bizarre and unreal, nothing like real life, but that's what is so good about it. Even their speech patterns are strange, which makes the voice-over narration all the more enjoyable and ridiculous. At first it feels like bad acting but then we get used to it and then we start to love it. But it's not by any means dumb comedy. On the contrary, it's very smart and deliberate in what it does. And this film has a spectacular sense of humor that is all its own and which stems from these bizarre and unique characters.At one point, the character played by John C. Reilly in perhaps his finest role, stares in bewilderment at man who asks him if he's ever danced before. After several awkward seconds, Reilly replies, quite matter-of-factly and with a lisp, ""Yes,"" only to then be asked what kind of dancing he did. Frustrated and still confused, Reilly sighs and responds: ""It depends on the music."" It's hilarious because it's exactly what the character should say but not what we would ever expect him to say. And the film is full of wonderful moments such as this, all dry and all hilarious.The writing and acting are exceptional and unlike anything I've ever seen before. It's been said that there are only seven or eight stories, each being told over and over again in different ways. But The Lobster seems to defy that statement. I can't think of any other movie or story to compare this to. This is truly a one-of-a-kind film and I feel it will develop a huge lasting legacy."
" Let's get cracking! Come on over for some lobster. It's a delightful watch.
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,7,"In a bleak dystopian future, where relationship are to be understood as simple as black and white, comes a movie about living in the grey area. Directed by Greek director, Yorgos Lanthimos, the film tells the story of David (Colin Farrell), a single architect that is forced to check into a sinister ""hotel"", in order to find a suitable life mate in 45 days. If his search ends in failure, he would be turned into an animal. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I took it to be a film about authority/herd mentality of human trying to put everything complex into a few simplistic type groups and those trying to survive life through fighting against that system or allowing it to rule them for self-preservation. The conflict of man vs machine and man vs self was very well-told by writers Efthymis Filippou & Yorgos Lanthimos. It's a movie about the human condition in the most nonhuman way. Yet, there were a lot of critics might dislike, this film for its intentionally awkward slow pacing and tone, finding it, kinda boring. However, for me, it's one of things that makes this movie, unique in a slow burn Hitchcockism mixed with Twilight Zone and Stanley Kubrick's horror type of a way. After all, the film is supposed to present a somewhat fictional dull world of distant sex mixed with complex bureaucracy. Great world-building. It remind me of biblical conservative blended with Stephen King's 'The Shining' & George Orwell's '1984' book. Also, it really needed to be that way, for the dry deadpan humor to have an effect. Because of this, the satire of sex comedies kinda works for me, while others might find it, pretentious. The scenes like, where they were watching propaganda extolling advantages of partnership & hunting single asexual people in the forest was hilarious to me in a dark way. Even some of the music were very funny. I kinda like the little thriller, Bernard Herrmann's theme that plays, during the fight scenes. It remind me of 1960's 'Psycho'. Another was the 'Something's Gotten Hold Of My Heart' by Roger Greenaway and Roger Cook, dance scene. Yet, there were some parts of the film, where some of the jokes seem to fall flat, mostly with the surreal concept of 'turning people into animals'. It really could had been funny, but the idea never really get off the ground in my opinion, and didn't lead to anything. It was very disappointing that we didn't see, much of that. Instead, the film goes with a different direction with a very unlikeable blind person punishment concept in the third act. In my opinion, it wasn't really interesting as we seem movies like this, before. Plus, it was very extremely inconsistent, seeing the villain mention other punishment like the ""red kiss"" and the unthinkable ""red intercourse"" yet they don't show it. It's here, where the movie really starts to loose, its charm. Still, I have to say, the acting throughout the film is amazing. Colin Farrell really put it all, as the paunchy sad-sack, David. He put on 40 pounds for his role. Even the supporting cast like Léa Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, John O'Reilly, and Rachel Weisz was just as good, in their untitled character roles. Everyone speaks with very little inflection and odd, stilted, overly-formal sentence structure, which surprisingly works for this type of a movie. Another great thing about this film is the cinematography by Thimios Bakatakis. Great use of the rural, lush, muted Irish locations. I also love the fact that production worked almost entirely with natural light and without much make-up. It's added to the naturalism look of the film. The classical music that went with it, was great as well. Love hearing Ludwig van Beethoven Symphony No.7 In A Major,Op.92: II.Allegretto & String Quartet No 1 in F major, Op 18, No 1 Adagio affettuoso ed appassionato, during the slow motion scenes. ""Where the Wild Rose's Grow"" by Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds was also nice to listen to. Overall: I have to say, this movie is very watchable, even with the slow parts. Dazzling in its sinister surrealism, wicked black comedy and touching pathos, The Lobster achieved in nearly everything, it was going for. It was a fantastic film that artists such like Luis Bunuel, Franz Kafka and Salvador Dali would had love."
" a treat
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,9,"This is a dark satire, set not so much in the future but in a kind of parallel present, in which being single is outlawed. Without a partner, you're either pray for hunters, or you have a chance to hook up with someone in a kind of institutional hotel. If you fail, you get taken to a transformation room, where you're turned into an animal.The film maintains a deadpan tone throughout, in vibrant contrast to the horrible deeds perpetrated by and upon the characters. The cast, led by Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, Lea Seydoux and Olivia Colman, enact scene after outrageous scene with straight faces. Goodness knows how they did it.It's merciless, often very funny, and as far as English-language movies are concerned there's really nothing like it that I'm aware of. A treat."
" One of the most disgusting movie I've ever seen
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,1,"This movie is about a world (I think) in future that people are forced to marry and they will be turned into animals if they can not or don't want to marry someone. So I think you already getting the comic idea that you expect to see in this movie. But you are wrong! It isn't a comedy movie. It is pointless, disturbing, horrible, confusing, foolish and illogical. Characters are stupid and unbelievable. The plot is boring and silly. There are lots of moments that you think why the hell they would say such a ridiculous dialogue or do such an idiotic thing. It isn't entertaining nor funny nor logical nor informative nor nothing. It is just awful. Don't bother waste your time on it."
" Best movie I've seen lately
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,3,"...SARCASM...I rather watch a van-Damme blockbuster movie, it's much more entertaining and psychological that this one. I'm not sure what's going on in the US or what's the vision of the Screen Writer about real world people relationships that this movie tries to imply. Sure, the society is quite sick and gets worse now-days but people relationships will probably never get near the play of this movie, at least for normal human-beings. Yet, if I'm looking at some societies, of how some people treat each other, sure, you can put it this way if you like. However the entire message could've been played in like 10 minutes or less with a higher impact. I personally lost some precious 2 hours of my life by watching this. It was so boring with so many ""WTF am I watching"" moments (one of them being the torture of the poor animals and why not people) that I'm not sure what was in the director's head. I think a 10 y/o kid could've done better. The ending is as ""exciting"" and obvious as the rest of the movie."
" A dead zone
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,5,"""The Lobster"" is certainly a challenging viewing experience, and it is a challenge I wasn't equal to.Conceptually, it is like Peter Greenaway's ""The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover"", and the short stories of Australian writer Peter Carey.People have described it as existing in a dystopian near future, but I don't find that approach necessary to understand the movie. Like Greenaway's movies and Carey's short stories, it's a fable: something we're not supposed to be able to place on a realistic timeline. It's just food for thought. The difference is that, in ""Her Lover"", Greenaway starts with a metaphorical situation and piles on the meaning until you have no choice but to work it out for yourself. The style is such that you can't look away.""The Lobster""'s style is no style. Even the performances are drained of any and all emotion. People say and do the most outrageous and bizarre things, and it's just not that interesting. I wanted to look away, and I did.It hurts to react with disinterest toward what is an intriguing central premise: a world where single people are forced to check into a hotel where they must find a partner before time runs out. Those that remain single are turned into animals. In the hotel, people are paired up for stunningly arbitrary reasons, eg. people who limp are paired together, people who are short sighted, and people who have nosebleeds. The similarities are so inconsequential that they are easily faked: one man bangs his face on the wall to make his nose bleed to hook up with a woman whose nose bleeds spontaneously. Outside the hotel, ""loners"" live in the woods, espousing a polar opposite ethos: for them, any and all romance is criminal, and acts of intimacy are punished with mutilation of the lips.At this stage, I had lost interest. The movie becomes predictable in its unpredictability: you tire of seeing so many inexplicable things on screen. The true lack of style is depressing and hard to watch.This is a movie that sucks life out of you, and I didn't appreciate it for that reason."
" The Lobster's Ecdysis: Great thought, Stupid narrative!
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,7,"I want to keep this review simple, unlike this movie, which fails terribly in setting the context.Movie opens with a scene, in which in which a lady gets out of the car and shoots an animal, an ass. This doesn't make any sense in first viewing (What's happening here is that she might be killing a person who has been transformed into an animal) Now, think what a bad-ass opening this film has. Love Revenge!There are two worlds in this cinema, 1. World of Couples 2. World of LonersAnd the Hotel is the society, which lays out the rules and ensures the people follow it.But the problem with this film is that there is no empathy in any form.Be it in acting, dialog, music or color. Nosebleed girl & nosebleed guy pair up Short sight guy & short sight girl pair up This is like a cinematic version of the tech issue, USB type-c compatibility.Why not make a music video instead of a feature length film? Or write a poem and publish the same? Or just paint?""And within a few weeks we could almost talk anything without even opening our mouths""Yes, they said it."
" Insane but unmissable I think
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,7,"Set in a dystopian world in what feels like a 1960's/70's setting The Lobster is a unique movie about love. Described on IMDb as a comedy, It might be one of the blackest comedies I've seen, or alternatively, it is an idea of a bleak past/future. It is shot in a very stark and minimalist way, reminiscent of Fahrenheit 451, so the quality of the acting is essential, ergo, this is not a Hollywood production! Colin Farrell shows a surprising acting ability, by being a nobody, an uninteresting guy you wouldn't take a second glance at. Rachel Weisz as the female lead is her usual brilliant self (she is also the narrator of the tale) and Olivia Coleman as the Hotel Manageress is fantastic. I can't say you will love it but it definitely will be memorable. I enjoyed it ,I think!"
" A Comedy?
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,1,"I don't know how this could be classified as a comedy, even a black comedy. In any comedy, I would expect at least to smile, not scowl through the whole thing.If this is supposed to be about. . . conformity, resistance to authority, love even . . . I can think of more appealing ways to deal with those subjects. ""Captures the nature of love in the 21st century."" Seriously? If that's what love is, don't let it anywhere near me!Like Youth, this is just another case of letting myself be influenced by critics raving about a movie, and then suffering through the entire thing waiting for something redeeming to happen, if only in my own mind, only to be disappointed in the end. In this case, sorely disappointed.Why I occasionally waste two hours at a time on drivel like this escapes me."
