" Shun the sheep movie
",2021-01-12 00:00:00,7,"I considered Aardmans last stop motion effort 'Pirates - in an adventures with scientists' to be a bit of a let down when it was released three years ago and wondered if they had gone off the boil a little bit by trying to appeal to the mass market and thus diluting their witty humour as a result. However after 80 odd minutes of Shaun the Sheep I am happy to report that they are back on track.Shaun is extremely well animated and manages to keep the story ticking along and funny enough to keep your interest without really feeling stretched. Considering as the film has no real dialogue to speak of that is no mean feat, and is reliant on top notch production design, expressive animation and a script that is entertaining and funny without being overly ridiculous. Whilst the Shaun the Sheep/Timmy Time TV shorts are aimed at young viewers, there is a decent amount of underlying humour here that adults will also engage with and thus it doesn't insult your intelligence the way some films do.After Aardmans infamous falling out with DreamWorks (who wanted them to Americanize Wallace & Gromit) I did wonder if Aardman had sold out for the mass market after feeling the Sony Pictures distributed Pirates had a whiff of compromise to it, and that's partly why I felt Pirates fell a bit flat. However Aardman have teamed up with an independent European distributor for Shaun and as a result it seems they were allowed to make the film they wanted to make this time round. In effect I was not disappointed with Shaun, the simple but hilarious premise of the TV show is expanded successfully to the big screen with no noticeable compromises for the mass market. That the film is also dialogue free should make it an easy sell abroad too and I'm glad to see the film has been well received.So well done to Aardman for making one of 2015's most enjoyable, entertaining and amusing films so far."
" Very entertaining
",2020-06-01 00:00:00,8,This film relies on purely visual comedy and it really pulls this off well. The sheep are cute and relatable. We really feel for them as they try to find the farmer. The best part was in the restaurant where they are trying to imitate being human.
" I think I lost brain cells
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,5,"The animation with clay is top notch... however, not having ANY dialogue makes the movie hard to watch and even my kids kept asking questions cause they were confused. The TV show probably worked because it was short and easier to digest. I feel it is too much for a hour plus movie. I laughed a few times but I felt they were trying too hard with all the slapstick humor that it took away from the story. I was going to give 1 star but I will give 5 mostly because I respect artist being one myself and know how much work went into creating the film."

",2020-04-07 00:00:00,8,"I like Sean the Sheep the most, it 's super cute, and the story is very interesting, even if I am old, I like to watch it."
" This movie is so beautiful. I can't express how much I loved it.
",2020-03-19 00:00:00,10,"Colorful visuals, fun story, vibrant music. and a heartwarming message at the end."
" 9 starts, easily.
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,9,"You can't go wrong with ANY Aardman production they are so well crafted and funny, you will invest your time on it with great returns, guaranteed! Go laugh!"
" It's fine for what it is
",2019-10-19 00:00:00,7,"A beautifully executed exercise in stop motion that takes a pastoral show and translates its antics to the city.Not an excruciating experience and I wouldn't say it's dull, but it does at times just feel like an overlong episode of a little kids show. Charming and very visually intelligent in that regard but I should think that one's viewing experience as an adult sorely needs the sound of prepubescent laughter by your side.A brilliant choice for pre-linguistic kids or kids who don't really have a grasp of English yet."
" Life's a treat with Shaun the sheep.
",2019-10-14 00:00:00,10,"This was yet another Aardman property known from the small screen to be successfully transfered to the big screen. You could argue that it is like an episode of the beloved tv shorts to feature length, but it adds in enough heart and story to make it feel like it's a feature length movie.Among the things added to the final product is a set up of how much the farmer likes his animals even though he can seem strict. And the mutual love from Shaun and the gang is what drives the movie forward and makes it so enjoyable.The humour is also a highlight, because when the farmer accidentally gets flung into the big city, his life is turned upside down and Shaun and the gang comes to his rescue and chaos ensues. Not the unfunny and noisy chaos like many recent animated comedies, but the well known sight gags and all that Aardman hilarity.If you love Shaun the sheep, you'll definitely enjoy this, but even casual viewers will find it charming and touching and a lot of fun."
" Glorious fun for all ages.
",2019-07-27 00:00:00,9,"A film that gets the balance right in appealing to both kids and adults. As with all top notch kids films, there are some bits that will sail over the heads of children whilst delighting adults. There isn't a dull moment and if you can't have a laugh at this, then you have a problem. Animation is of course first rate, and the attention to detail is astonishing. This is Aardmans best for me, and I can't wait for the new one!"
" Ewe Wool Love It!
",2019-07-22 00:00:00,9,"""I loved it,"" he exclaimed, sheepishly.This movie is shear joy, really not baaaad at all!So creative and original, claymation is amazing on its own, but the manic storyline keeps you entertained throughout, just brilliant!"
" Brilliant!
",2019-07-15 00:00:00,10,"OMG!! Brilliant. BRILLIANT!!!
Loved it. Aardman productions makes some of the best good-natured entertainment in the world. I started with CREATURE COMFORTS and have been a fan ever since."
" Maybe a step down for Aardman.
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,7,"As always, I do enjoy the innate charm of Aardman animation, especially when they go so far as to tell an entire story with practically no understandable dialogue. Still, this didn't feel quite as charming or funny as some of their other work. Sure, they had the obligatory ""Silence of the Lambs"" reference, but a lot of the film really didn't rely as much on the sight gags and visual humor that Aardman is known for. Yeah, maybe this was to appeal to a younger audience, but in the end it made the movie feel like it was missing something."
" Gud
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,2,"Not enough horses. Horses are gud. I like horse, once I rode a horse and it was gud."
" Aardman's Best Outing Yet
",2019-03-21 00:00:00,9,"When Shaun's plan to get all the animals a day off goes spectacularly wrong, the farmer ends up in the big city alone and with no idea who he is, and it's up to Shaun and the gang to find him and make him remember, while dodging an especially overzealous animal control officer. This is as much of a plot as you get, and as much as you need in this whimsically charming children's comedy from Aardman.Closely based on the television series of the same name, Shaun the Sheep is built around simple storytelling and simple pleasures, as befitting its target audience. However simple in this case should not be confused with dumb. The story may not be any more complex than that of a Saturday morning cartoon, but every minute has been packed with humorous details and charming visuals, like a Mr. Hulot's Holiday for the kiddie set.Slapstick and sight gags are constant and frequently hilarious. They range from simple trip and fall gags and funny animal faces to elaborate sequences that build and build with one thing after another going wrong until everything is delightful chaos. Oddly for a children's movie, the best of these gags involves a man with his head stuck up a horse's rear, though thankfully not a real horse's. There is the occasional burping or flatulence based joke, but far less than in most other contemporary kids' movies.What's striking in its absence is spoken dialog, or at least any that's intelligible. The people talk, but it all comes out mumbled like the adults in those old Peanuts cartoons. Not that this is a problem. In the absence of spoken words, the characters frequently mime out their thoughts and intentions in a manner that would make Marcel Marceau proud. And it's just as well that they don't talk, because no words could be as good as the befuddled facial expressions of the city dwellers watching the sheep go by disguised as people, nor could they have improved the spectacle of the villain being seduced by two sheep dressed as a young lady.If Shaun the Sheep is in some ways old fashioned with its simple narrative and stop motion animation it can also be remarkably modern, as when the amnesiac farmer becomes a social media sensation, being reimagined by the internet into the image of Wolverine, Nyan Cat, and an Obama campaign ad. And while kids will delight in watching a cow being launched over the Moon Inn, their parents can take pleasure in references to Live and Let Die, Donald Trump's toupe, and I swear I'm not making this up; Breaking Bad.Like a Roadrunner cartoon crossed with Babe, Shaun the Sheep is hilarious, charming, and refreshing straightforward in its approach to storytelling. It will delight small children and adults alike. In short it's everything one would expect from Aardman."
" Lovely film with a heart
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed this film, excellent in all aspects exceptet the terrible singing parts. Strongly recommend it."
" A technical feat, but the lack of a firm script was felt.
",2018-11-29 00:00:00,6,"This movie was something totally unexpected to me. When I first started watching, I thought a movie for kids would bore me dead. The absence of spoken dialogue was something I had not seen in a feature film for a long time, at least since the last time I watched a silent movie. But I didn't get annoyed, on the contrary. I thought it has its own beauty and it's funny, even though it's not the kind of movie I see every day.We do not have a fixed plot. The story told is very light and gives space for the several jokes and humour moments that they wanted to create in the middle. In essence, the film tells how a flock of funny sheep tries to find their farmer, missing for days in the middle of the big city and suffering from amnesia. Of course, there is a villain, who is the city's animal control agent (we've seen something like that in other animal movies in town).This is a stop-motion animated film... nothing more, nothing less than the most laborious and arduous technique for making animated films. Aardman still uses it regularly, probably being the latest animation studio to do so, and is adept at this technique, so it should not be surprising if I say that the whole film is technically impeccable. Even the soundtrack worked very well. As I already mentioned, I was very surprised at the decision not to use spoken dialogue. But it even made sense, because it puts human beings at the margins of history to give space to animals.The film earned the Oscar nomination in its respective category (""Best Animated Film""), but never went beyond that. Despite this, and the film seems to have been quickly forgotten by the public, it did deserve it. It's not brilliant nor remarkable, it's perfectly forgettable due to the absence of an impact script... but it's a technical feat and it's funny."
" Good old-fashioned entertainment
",2018-09-21 00:00:00,7,"A British animated film tells the story of a farmer whose life is turned into chaos as he is unexpectedly transported to a nearby big city. A flock of his sheep and his sheepdog try to find him and bring him back. There's not only the usual city vs. country contrast but also one of humans vs. animals.Perhaps ""Chicken Run"" (2000) is the benchmark for great British animated films. While ""Shaun"" may not quite reach that level, it's very close and it's a winner in the all-around entertainment factor.The inevitable mishaps in the city have a good share of slapstick in which everyone seems to get a piece. (The worst slapstick is when only the same character or a few characters are the constant victims.) There is also a good jab against the pretense of celebrity, style, and trends.The climactic scene is enjoyable even if it might not be outstanding. But ""Shaun the Sheep Movie"" also has a good heart in its compassion for its various characters. It really is good old-fashioned entertainment."
" One of the most purely visual pictures I've ever seen; not quite 'Wallace & Gromit', but it's close.
",2018-06-24 00:00:00,9,"'Shaun The Sheep Movie (2015)' is one of the most purely visual pictures I've ever seen, being perhaps the closest thing to a silent film - sans sound effects - since the fall of that era, at least. It actually pushes past many of those iconic pieces because they often used title-cards to convey vital information, be it dialogue or otherwise, and this flick sees fit not to do so, only resorting to some easily-translatable signage for some simple visual gags entirely supplementary to the plot. This clarity of story-telling allows for the film to transcend all boundaries of age or nationality, making it an incredibly joyous and wholly wholesome affair throughout that is often hilarious, usually chuckle-worthy and always smile-inducing. The variety of gags, some of which are genius in their simplicity and universality, is matched only by the standard of animation, which is consistently friendly and inventive. The overall experience is elevated by each of the piece's parts, becoming a surprisingly effective and supremely entertaining animation from the studio that just keeps on giving. It's not quite 'Wallace & Gromit', but it's close. 9/10"
" A fantastic silent movie.
",2018-05-09 00:00:00,8,"Okay, I know that this film technically isn't silent, but it's totally dialogue-free just like the TV show it's based on. The most you get out of 'dialogue' is basically unintelligible grunts and gibberish that in itself is pretty funny alongside the animation style that comes with it. Aardman Animations are Britain's claymation equivalent to Japan's animation powerhouse: Studio Ghibli. The film's story is simple, short and sweet just as all animated family films strive to be.Shaun the Sheep has become a rather iconic part of British pop-culture both within the UK itself and abroad; it's arguably become even more iconic than Wallace and Gromit, the very franchise from which Shaun originally came from. And oddly enough this sheep has launched his very own compelling universe that achieves all the slapstick Wallace and Gromit had before it.This movie has a simple story and great physical comedy suitable for all ages, and it's got some touching moments as well. Give this children's film a go. It's worth it; especially if you love animation."
" Everyday Feels Like Summer With You
",2018-01-05 00:00:00,10,"After Wallace & Gromit caught on, a new character entered in their third short ""A Close Shave"" whom would later be called Shaun the Sheep. Shaun soon got himself a beloved TV show, so it was inevitable that he would soon get his own feature film one day. Well, that day happened in 2015 with the release of Shaun the Sheep Movie, which did pretty well at the box office and earned massive critical acclaim for its simplistic charm, lovable characters, cute animation, and sense of childhood wonderment. I agree, as this could probably make even the most cynical jerk feel like a happy child again.The story is simple enough, Shaun is tired of the same rules of living on his farmer's farm, so he and the sheep decide to have just one day off and have fun. But then, the farmer ends up getting lost in the city, so it's up to Shaun and his gang (along with Bitzer the dog) to save the farmer and go back home, while also avoiding the animal containment worker Trumper. That simple storyline is perfect for this film, as Shaun the Sheep was always a simple series, so why not have the most basic concept? That being said, the execution is what really stands out and it gives the movie some heart. Even though Shaun just wanted a day off, it would come with consequences, but he would never think it would mean nearly losing his loving master. Adding on to that, the humor of this movie is delightful. Of course it appeals to children, but even adults may get a kick out of it due to its appealing nature and the situations of the characters. Speaking of the characters, despite not being highly developed, the film still gives them enough personality to stand out and the very situations they end up in deliver the best gags. Even the antagonist has his moments of genuine humor and terror, just from his will to capture any animal alive. Not to mention, the movie even makes good use of modern day technology to help drive the story without making it too much of a gimmick.Stop motion has really been pushing the boundaries of cinema thanks to Laika, but Aardman have always been masters at crafting their own simplistic albeit charming puppets. The characters look like the traditional adorable designs you'd see in an Aardman film along with solid movements, and even many of the visual gags feel like throwbacks to silent comedies. Considering that the whole movie is told without dialogue, it's amazing how the crew were able to tell an entire story with just the emotions and the setting of a big city. Plus, along with a beautiful city, the meadows in the country side of England are simply gorgeous, and it shows just how hard the crew worked in bringing them to life. Oh, and phenomenal mesh of electronics.Finally, the main song Everyday Feels Like Summer With You is a brilliant theme to showcase just how endearing it is to be with the ones we love. Shaun and the gang may have wanted the day off, but without the farmer, the love just isn't there. Is it not a fantastic feeling to frolic with the ones we love most which in return brings us back to when we were once children? And that's why I think Shaun the Sheep Movie is a masterpiece of a children's film, simply for the fact that along with witty jokes, sweet characters, and adorable visuals, the movie makes us feel as if we are watching it with the mindset of an innocent happy child aided by those who loved us. So seek this movie out and regain your childhood; heck, if you have any kids, let them watch it so they can have a happy childhood like many of us once did."
" Beautiful, Touching, So Sweet !
",2017-09-07 00:00:00,10,"Shaun The Sheep (2015) is an animated comedy adventure film from the United Kingdom. The film was released on February 6, 2015. The film tells the story of the sheep's shaun and his comrades must save his mistress who disappeared in the city. They must try to bring back the master to the ranch. And they have to fight the animal catcher ... This animation is so cute, touching, and sweet ... I watched this movie a few minutes ago ... This animation makes me laugh with the silliness of his character's foolishness .. The touching scene at the end of the movie make me touched ..... Shaun the sheep (2015) one of the best animations ever made ..."
" A very funny and clever film.
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,9,"The people who work at Aardman Animations clearly still have some hilarious humor to them. I can happily say this because the ""Shaun the Sheep Movie"" clearly demonstrates that they can keep making great movies. I heavily enjoyed their previous works like ""Chicken Run"" and ""The Curse of the Were Rabbit"" and now they have brought there other big star to the screen in a very unique way. What I mean is that this film has the humor and heart of a brilliant animated movie that doesn't have one word spoken throughout the entire movie. It may seem impossible to pull this of, but luckily it works. Still, there's more to this film that makes it work and I'll explain why.Our main character Shaun is a mischievous sheep who lives at the Mossy Bottom Farm out in the countryside, but is bored by his daily farm life routine. One day, he gets an idea to put the farmer to sleep so his flock can do whatever they want. How do this? Well, they make the farmer count his own sheep, of course. The plan backfires, however, after the sheep puts the farmer in a caravan which accidentally rolls away from the farm and into the city. Now, it's up to the sheep of the farm and the farm dog Bitzer to get him back and stay away from the evil animal catcher.The film may sound very silly to you, but trust me when I say that the film is actually pretty hilarious. It shows us that animated movies don't need to have tons of dialogue for humor to make for a very entertaining movie. Yes, the story is basic, but it always was supposed to be. It didn't need to be really complicated, because children would easily not understand what's going on, and that's exactly what this movie does so brilliantly. The stop motion animation like always is fantastic. The painstaking hours the company spent on creating clay models and moving them slightly has paid off because the characters move as if they were drawn on paper or even a computer. The characters, while not having a lot of depth, are hilarious as ever as they do pretty humorous moments in the film. For example, Bitzer is trying to get into a hospital to get the farmer, but can't go in because he's a dog. So, he dresses up like a doctor and accidentally gets tricked for being the doctor operating on a surgery. It may sound cliché to you, but trust me when I say that it leads to a moment so funny that I dare not spoil it here.""Shaun the Sheep Movie"" is a film that the whole family can easily enjoy. Kids can laugh at the silly moments while adults can appreciate the technicality of the film. In my opinion, this film is a clear example of how visual media is stronger than written media. I just wish more films would do that nowadays."
" Sheep's Day Off
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,7,"The sheep on a small farm hatch a clever plan to have a day off, but things turn awry as their farmer ends up in the city with amnesia in this animated comedy from Aardman. While based on a television series of the same name, the film works remarkably well even with limited knowledge of the show and characters, though the most remarkable aspect of 'Shaun the Sheep Movie' is the complete absence of dialogue. There are some awkward bits in which the human characters mutter incomprehensibly to one another, but for the most part, the film spins an incredibly involving story without the need for spoken words throughout. Not of all the humour is slapstick either, which would have been an easy trap to fall into here. There are some neat visual puns, like a cow literally jumping over the moon, while the funniest moments come from the claymation humans reacting to all the chaos around them (look out for one foreground character's reaction when the animal catcher becomes stuck inside a horse!). There is also an amazingly funny part in which the sheepdog is mistaken for a surgeon and the patient being operated on is heavily anesthetised after trying to point out his tail to the operating room nurses. Not all of the gags work and the climax is more than a little over-the-top, but this is otherwise a surprising delight from start to finish."
" Greatest stop-motion animated movie for kids&adults
",2017-03-30 00:00:00,10,"I am being really honest here. i am 18 year's old, and i do not really like watching kid movies. However, Shaun the sheep the movie literally made me almost cry, even though it is in fact aimed for kids to watch. The movie does not have any words, but just mumbling, and making sounds to describe the Emotion. However, this movie touched very deep inside my mind, pointing out the importance of a family and reminiscence. Usually, if a short-film animations comes out as a movie, there ain't no much thing to show. Maybe the similar style but a longer version of it. However, Shaun the sheep the movie contains every side of a great movie. I laughed many times, also almost cried at the end, and also made me think of many things in our life. I never expected such a stop-motioned animation to be this great and fun. I recommend this movie to everyone. i hope this kind of movie comes out again, and im 100% sure that i am definitely going to watch the next one."
" Shaun the Sheep Movie
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,6,"'Shaun the Sheep Movie' is the spin-off feature film of a spin-off television series of 'Wallace and Gromit: The Wrong Trousers'. Boasting the same crew that brought us 'Chicken Run' and 'Wallace and Gromit', it promised a lot.The film is made by the Aardman production company and so boasts a pleasant stop-start animation style. This ""old-school"" way of creating a cartoon is refreshing in the modern world of overused computer imagery and 3D effects.There is no dialogue whatsoever in this film and so it feels like watching an old cartoon such as 'Tom and Jerry'. There are subtle nods to other television shows and films such as 'Breaking Bad', 'Hannibal' and 'Taxi Driver' so the parents are kept amused at times.The story is very easy to follow due to the characters very expressive faces and directions which, being a children's film, make it a lot more simple and universal.Overall, 'Shaun the Sheep Movie' is a good film for children. It has very cute characters and the animation is very fun. However, it doesn't have much for any other demographic unlike the company's previous work. But, saying that, it is an inoffensive and enjoyable film."
