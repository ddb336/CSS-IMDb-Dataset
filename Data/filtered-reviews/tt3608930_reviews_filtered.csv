" Come on man
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,4,"The intro credits were the best part. I get what they are trying to do here but you can act better, Add a few extras, and writer a better story. Make movies like this but don't get lazy. Ethan Hawke is not a cowboy. Cast this with some unknowns and it's a better movie"
" Humorous and a little bloody.
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,8,"I think many of the low rated reviews fail to take into account that this is not a serious movie, get over yourselves. You are not going to get a job reviewing movies for any of the Main Stream Fake Media outlets, especially if you take this movie literally. If you cannot see that, it is right in your face, then you cannot see anything requiring an actual critic to create a dialog with the subtle artistic values that movies contain."
" Could have used some authenticity, maybe.
",2021-02-25 00:00:00,4,"Look, every director has a vision. What makes a film enjoyable is largely subjective, but every once in a while a movie comes along that has no right to be as bad as it is.I can't say that In a Valley of Violence is a particularly terrible movie, but I also can't say that it's a particularly good one. It's just kind of... here.
You can tell it had potential, but just fell kind of flat, and only because of a handful of mishandled elements. I'd say authenticity is the name of the game.Firstly, the town feels weirdly underpopulated, even for a mining town that was abandoned by the mining company.
There's Mary-Anne and Ellen, the sisters who run the hotel. Gilly, Harris, Roy, and Tubby, who are sort of an idiot's posse (if four idiots can be a posse). Gilly's father the local Marshall, who also apparently acts as mayor/governor/shogun. Dollar Bill, the general store owner. The friendly neighborhood bartender which comes stock with every western. Everyone else is just a handful of extras and it makes the town seem like as a business owner you should just move to Phoenix because no one's really here to hold up an economy. Just 10 or so more extras would have made the town feel more ""full of people who need saving"" as the movie suggests.Set dressing is somewhat bare. Every space feels like one of those ""Wild West Museum Towns"" with actors who give winded monologs about their character and the town's history. Just terribly inauthentic.Ethan Hawke (Paul) was very good in this movie. He's one of it's few saving graces and seems to know what he's doing when it comes to the dialog and action. Aside from Burn Gorman (the Priest), and Toby Huss (Harris), it's difficult to say the same for just about anybody else in the cast. Though, I liked doggy. Doggy good. Good doggy.James Ransone (Gilly) didn't apply himself to the role as much as he should have. Maybe he's just too modern, he didn't seem to fit. Most of the anachronisms in the dialog belong to him and Karen Gillan (Ellen). It could be a direction problem, but I think the fault lies mostly in the casting here.John Travolta (The Marshall) applied himself too much to the wrong character and undershot his own. His accent was frankly ridiculous and he sounded inordinately squeaky. He felt more like a character in a Seltzer-Friedberg parody movie than, you know, the Marshall of a remote dusty town which he rules unchallenged with an iron-fist, the impression the movie tries to give. God only knows what kind of movie he expected this to be, but he was sadly mistaken in any case. This is absolutely a direction problem. I've seen Travolta do much better. We all have.The movie is shot with a very wide depth of field, which leaves many backgrounds partially in focus, when they should be out of focus. It gives the whole film a very flat appearance. Maybe they couldn't afford very many lenses and prioritized the ones they needed for the bulk of filming, but I think if they had employed the split diopter technique, and some focus tracking, they could have shot with a shallower depth of field in some very important cases.There's not much color grading to speak of. It's either very subtle or they stopped at basic color correction. Desert scenes are usually graded with warm tones. They could have used a haze filter to bring in some more midtone, and stacked a neutral density filter with it to crush shadows and bring detail into the midground. It seems to me all they did was throw a polarizer on it to bring the sky down into the exposure setting so it wasn't blown out.There's one odd sequence in the movie that's halfway between a nightmare and a memory, it's shot handheld and lit only with a flashlight. It's... a sequence, anyway... I suppose it's meant to look dreamlike and frantic. Personally I wouldn't have used a camcorder flashlight because it has a distinctive halo and might bring someone out of immersion to think ""Hey! That's a flashlight!"" which was my experience. I just feel like it steps on the sequence in an unfair way. I would have used a more radial firelight and also handheld a wide-angle lens so it looks less like run-and-gun handicam footage in a YouTube video. There are many techniques to make a bizarre dreamlike image, the one this movie used would fit in a more modern period story."
" Over a dog....????
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,6,"I liked the movie for it's flair and Hawke's acting. And it has potential for a far better 'lesson-learned' follow-up.
But thats about it.Tips:First: Tarantino
Don't copy. He is unique in his own sick and brilliant mind.secondly: John Wick
Don't copy. The movie is unique too....but ehh... never mind.Thirdly: the antagonist.
Either make him scary, or make him a joke, but don't mix the two.
Again, Tarantino is unique.Fifth: Humor.
Everything you write in a script that makes you feel you are funny: delete it, especially if you direct the movie.
Why? Study Tarantino: It feels like it is never meant to be funny, yet it is. Every sick (violent) joke in the script is carried by an element of love or empathy for the victim. Tarantino never makes fun of his characters for just the fun of it.
This movie does.Sixth:
You don't kill a bunch of laughable sorry kind of criminals over a dog unless the dog means something more then being a pet. And it does, but the reason is only hinted at in a clumsy, not paying-off flashback. It is not properly worked out. Why? Because the main-character is a Eastwood-ish kind of lomer with social problems.
That's why Eastwood-ish kind of lomers don't kill over a dog because they lack the potential to exonerate themselves in the scipt."
" Oh this was/is a comedy
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,5,"When I first started to watch this movie I thought it had terrible dialog (using modern days slang and dialog), campy lines, and misdated weapons and technology I would have given the movie a rating of 2.
However once it was pointed out to me that this was a comedy, it started to make sense. Now I started to laugh, ignored the inaccurate technology and weapons ,the use of modern dialog, and just sat back and enjoyed it.
The charters were bland and predictable with the exception of The Marshal played by John Travolta as his was the only believable one. The plot was really non-existent and highly predictable.
Still it is an easy movie to follow and rather safe for all."
" Something for everyone
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,10,"I didn't know if I should laugh or cry. Very unusual.
Monthly Python meets Clint Eastwood. A little over the top and tongue in cheek. I loved the relationship between the protagonist and his dog. I recommend this movie because it is very entertaining."
" You killed my dog now prepare to die...
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,5,John wick turned into a western. Very predictable and cringe worthy.
" yikes
",2020-12-16 00:00:00,2,"If you value your time, i would spend the hour and 40 minutes doing literally except watching this. the script seemed to be written by a 10 year old cowboy who saw john wick. truly awful. ethan did a fine enough job but the film was so very disappointing"
" As far as westerns go, this was a confused attempt.
",2020-12-11 00:00:00,4,"Let me get into it, the dialogue is written as if the characters are a parody of spaghetti western movies. Either the characters, such as the protagonist, are too gruff and typically beatdown; or like the antagonist, far too cocky and bullish; or like the pretty bathhouse owner, just too damn perky and stupid.How does all of that work in a western? It plays out like a comedy without the humour really. Westerns are my favourite genre so I tried to enjoy this, I let it play through. Something different, the protagonist has a dog companion. Things happen, and he goes crazy.Anyway the plot is very shallow, and in the end not much else is offered to beef the plate up. It just plays out like a revenge movie, but without much of the gripping stuff that gets me going such as in 'Unforgiven'. The sets are average, the music is generic. The acting is offish by a lot of the cast.4/10 a disappointing flick, I am sad to say."
" It's the same story as John Wick.
",2020-11-23 00:00:00,5,"Like, EXACTLY the same story.
...
Apparently the above sentence is too short to submit as a review. So I'm typing these words. Nothing else needs to be said with respect to this movie."
" Seen it all before
",2020-11-20 00:00:00,5,This is a High Plains Drifter wannabe. It should be titled High Plains Drifter 2. I've get to go re-watch Clint Eastwood to clear this out of my head and see some real film making again.
" Revenge is sweet
",2020-11-19 00:00:00,7,"What can I say? I love a good revenge western ðŸ˜‰. The beginning of this film is awesome, the graphics and the lettering were reminiscent of the old spaghetti westerns. The music is awesome. Like I said, nothing like payback! John Travolta is one of my all time favorites, when he's good he's very very good, and when he's bad he's even better."
" Below-average western.
",2020-11-18 00:00:00,5,"I don't know what movie did the other reviewers saw. What I saw was an oversimplified, uninteresting and predictable plot, and bad acting (maybe Hawke and Travolta did what they could with the bad script, I don't know, I just judge based on what I watched). There was not a single time during this movie when I cared about any of the characters (that were, as expected, very underdeveloped).
Most scenes were hard to believable, and for moments it looked more like a black comedy than an action/thriller.Maybe you don't have anything else to watch, but if you do, just pass on this one."
" seriously?
",2020-11-11 00:00:00,5,Was pretty decwnt until the gunfight scene in the street....turned into a damn dark comedy out of nowhere.....really killed whatever credibility was left
" 1 of the 3 Worst ""Westerns"" EVER.
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,1,"Don't bother watching ""In a Valley of Violence."" Great cast; stupid movie.Civil War PSTD refugee avenges the senseless murder of his dog. Kinda ""Unforgiven"" without the great story or script or acting or anything. There's a couple of funny Travolta lines, but the rest of the movie is just horrible."
" Ethan Hawke
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,2,"Ethan Hawke is a knicks fan and as such, is familiar with disappointment. He was the sole reason this movie does NOT get a 1...
John Travolta had better make another movie quickly because his acting in Valley of Violence would be a terrible way for him to leave a legacy. Usually a fan, Hairspray, FaceOff, Pulp Fiction, etc... so terrible to watch him stumble through clumsy lines.
Do we REALLY need another John Wicks meets High Plains Drifter."
" Poor script/director
",2020-10-22 00:00:00,3,"Good camera work is all I can for this film. The men in the saloon were too clean, well dressed and healthy. Ethan's poor horse was tied up during the time him and his dog took a bath. Poor horse didn't get any water. feed, or rub down. Gilly's nose show sign of being punched or broken. Ethan was dropped at least a 100 feet off a cliff and suffered no broken arms, legs or bones. The script had the word ""c**ks**k**"", was that used in the 1860's? Anyway, skip this dumb wanna-be ""spaghetti western."""
" What a waste of casting!
",2020-10-21 00:00:00,1,"Brief bursts of authentic western get your hopes up, only to have those hopes dashed by an inane script. More corn here than in Iowa (no offense to Iowa), with interludes that gag (oh, please spare us that crying-into-the-dirt bit). Behind the scenes, Travolta and Hawke both laughed all the way to the bank, but Hawke is far too young and talented to risk his career on such a trashy excuse for a film."
" Not terrible...
",2020-10-21 00:00:00,5,If you ever wondered what John Wick might be like as a western... here you go.
" Good old school style Western
",2020-10-20 00:00:00,8,"Anyone complaining is obviously missing the point. This was a good old fashioned Western with plenty of fun. Like all spaghetti, it's supposed to have a little cheese. Sit back and enjoy and don't over think it."
" We Could All Use A Little Saving!!!!!
",2020-10-20 00:00:00,8,"Odd I'd never even heard of this one and it's 4 years old here when im watching it for the first time. I just watched 4 BLUMHOUSE MOVIES that amazon recommended and only1 of 4 was decent so lets see how this DO!!!Now, the opening sequence here with HAWKE and his DOG and the good Reverend I am finding very nice.+1 Star for the fine opening sequence!!!Then it's on to the fine Town of DENTON!!! THEY CALL THIS PLACE THE VALLEY OF VIOLENCE!!Well acted violent little Gilly and the tirade the two sisters have at each other at their hotel or whatever it is they run. Ruh Roh. The Marshall Travolta has been called in!!! He advises HAWKE to be on his way out of town. HAWKE obliges the Marshall.And of course....HAWKE is woken up that night, by MASKED bandits? Oh of course, the Deputy GILLY who he embarrassed in town by knocking him out. And Gilly, he is one evil GIT. He kills HAWKE'S dog with a knife. And then he tells HAWKE how he's going to remember him. And then they drop HAWKE off a cliff. They don't bother to check to see if he's DEAD or not.+1 STar for Gilly's little evil tirade...well MORNING COMES AND of course HAWKE IS STILL ALIVE!!! Some damage but he manages to walk back to his camp where a vulture is pecking on his dead dog. Poor DOG.And now it is TIME FOR SOME PAYBACK!!!+1 STAR for the first KILL IN THE BATHTUB!!!!Now Marshall Travolta and the Other 2 lackeys are out searching the TOWN for HAWKE!!! And it's LAWRENCE!!! NOT TUBBY!!! AND LAWRENCE doesn't grasp the concept of not staying away from the window. And Marshall Travolta!!!! Man can he take a bullet or what??? And Gilly!!! He takes a beating too but he doesn't survive a bullet in the back very well. Damn women who shoot men in the back are bad!!! Very bad!!!I liked this. Entertaining. Not too much shenanigans. 8/10"
" Low Budget Stinker
",2020-10-20 00:00:00,1,"Aside from a well trained dog there is not much to recommend. Film is characterized as an underrated Travolta film. In my opinion, underrated is being generous!"
" Predictable and lazy
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,2,"I did not find one single moment if this movie that I was not already aware of what was going to happen other than the lazy writing...somehow that caught me off guard.If you have been threatened and told to leave town during mid day, why are you building a fire and sleeping hours later in direct view of the town?If you wake up after being thrown off a cliff, shouldn't there be a cliff somewhere in the vicinity? The low rolling hills made me laugh at how poorly directed this show was.I always knew who was going to die and how they were going to die, right up to and including the final death.With the big names, I figured it would get better, so I hung on. Now I wish I had just gotten some sleep. This is two hours of my life that I will never get back.Don't waste a moment if your time on this pandering and oh so predictable plot. Don't expect A list actors to save the movie. There us nothing redeeming here. Find something else to watch or grab yourself a good book.If you ignore this advice, just remember....you were warned."
" Was this supposed to be a parody?
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,2,"I really like westerns and I was excited to see a western with such great actors Ethan Hawke and John Travolta. The beginning seemed really stereotypical with the drunk Irish Catholic priest drunk on moonshine or what have you. But, I kept watching. Then it got boring. I mean really slow and boring. And then the guy finally leaves town and they come after him and shoot his dog and hold him hostage, at least for a bit, while he, Ethan's character who is supposed to be such a brave ""big man"" cries and whines for many many minutes. OK. I'm not a sexist but in westerns the hero doesn't cry or whine. And so I am waiting for him to do some amazing move and what? He gets pushed over a cliff. Next day he wakes up. He's ""ok"" even if he hit his head on apparently sharp rocks, he doesn't really seem to even have a headache. But now he is pissed, I mean really pissed because he finds his dog dead and being eaten by birds. I too would be pissed. But now, now, it is time for the big show down. See what I mean? Is this supposed to be a comedy wrapped up with western violence? It just goes on down to comedy central. If it is a joke, it is a great one. If this is supposed to be serious, it is a big looser!"
" Great Western
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,9,I would have liked to see a darker tone to color of the film. The bright color did not enhance the story through contrast nor did it add to the comic elements. This movie had some moments where I am sure writer/director Ti West was laughing out loud while he was writing.
" An homage to Eastwood
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,6,This movie is heavily influenced by Clint Eastwood's westerns with a hint of Tarantino.
" Ransone & The Dog Make The Movie - But Mainly The Dog
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,5,"James Ransone's acting was so over the top it made me laugh out loud a couple of times. This is a standard revenge story that was written, directed & edited by the same guy. Nothing new here folks but Ransone's ridiculous portrayal of the villain makes it worth a watch. Travolta does his usual journeyman solid acting but there wasn't a lot of storyline for him to work with. The rest of the cast was okay with no particular standouts except for the the actress that played Ransone's girlfriend. She also overacted but was completely overshadowed by Ransone. Give it a watch if you have time to kill & nothing better to do. And, by the way, kudos to the dog trainer."
" A Decent Movie That Is Half Over Before Anything Worth Watching Begins
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,7,"10/16/2020 This was a fairly decent cowboy/old western movie. Never very exciting but still an OK watch. Taissa Farmiga (Vera's younger sister) plays MaryAnn, the young hotel proprietor and does an excellent job in her light hearted character presentation. Ethan Hawke did a decent job too, but he never comes across as being very real to me. His quirks and facial mannerisms always ring FAKE in my book, but I still watch his movies anyway. I liked his dog better, much prettier too. Travolta (aka ""Stumpy"") was pretty good as usual. The bad cowboy (a Christian Bale wanna-be) SUCKED. This was an OK easy-to-watch movie, so I suggest that you give it a try? Bon Appetit'Speaking of Stumpy??? - Many decades ago a poor family's daughter lost an eye. Her father carved her a wooden eye as a replacement. The kids at school teased her and called her ""Wood Eye"". A school dance was forthcoming and the only boy that she thought would take her was a poor farm boy who lost his leg and his father carved him a replacement. After school one day she mustered up the courage to ask him to the dance. His response? Oh, would I, would I?
Hurt and apparently rejected she cried out, ""Peg Leg"" ""Peg Leg"""
" Underrated
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,8,The writing wasn't super but it was entertaining and had a good balance of comedy and drama. Worth the watch.
" Best western in years
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,9,When my father was alive he loved the Westerns. So do I. Ethan Hawke and Travolta were great. It's the best western I've seen in years.
" The movie is very good for western fans, don't be fooled by the reviews
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,9,"Don't be fooled by the negative reviews. It's not a movie for everyone, but western fans. It has all ingredients for a classical western, an anguished protagonist haunted by his past, an innocent girl trapped in a miserable city, a bully son of the town's marshal and vendetta. Positively surprised by the quality and nostalgia this film evokes.If you want to watch it, hurry up, it's leaving HBO now by the end of August 2020."
" Just a good movie!!!
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,7,"Anyone who likes John Wick likes this movie. IN A VALLEY OF VIOLENCE, is very similar to John Wick, is violent, has good performances, good soundtrack and good cast."
" The John Wick of Westerns
",2020-05-30 00:00:00,7,"Simple rule, you kill my dog, I kill you. PERIOD!Man what is it with all the dog killing in movies? Stop it! My heart bleeds every time that happens. So im glad he kills all those nasty people"
" A decent spaghetti western, don't overthink it.
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,8,"A decent spaghetti western, don't overthink it. As other reviewers have mentioned it is entertaining."
" Not so bad
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,7,"Actors of this movie were unfamiliar to me except Travolta and Hawke. So I didn't have much expectations of the movie. This wasn't so bad western like many other newer movies of this genre. Although In a Valley of Violence isn't masterpiece or the Oscar winner.Plot is very simple. A stranger named Paul (Hawke) comes to a small and poor town. Gilly, a son of a marshal (Ransome as the son and Travolta as the marshal) bullies the stranger and they fight on the main street of the town. After losing Gilly revenges by killing Paul's dog. A final scene is a series of many gunfights. There is some unnecessarily boring periods in the middle of the movie but after these the final scene is good enough.The actors were surprisingly good especially Farmiga as Mary-Anne. The movie respects Spaghetti Westerns by many ways like music. At the same time there is very much satirical humor. I liked ""conversations"" between Hawke and the dog named Abby. This isn't the legendary western movie but entertainment for the weekend. 7/10"
" Good acting. Horrible story line.
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,6,"Swing this movie from the perspective of history, the plot is laughable, and the intensity with which the characters try to make you think it's serious is just amusing.
The best part of the movie is how Lange shows the the challenges of being married to a untreated bi polar wife.
It also showed how psychotropics do more damage than good in the hospitals."
" Hard to describe how bad this movie is
",2020-03-21 00:00:00,1,This is rated a 6 on IMDB?!!??? What are people SMOKIN' while they are watching this movie to rate it ANYTHING higher than a 2!!!!!!!!! I love Ethan Hawke and John Travolta but even they are terrible. A complete and total waste of time.
" Anyone giving 5 stars above must have no idea
",2020-02-16 00:00:00,4,"What a western movie should be like.
Ok, westerns are not popular because of it's plot. 99% of the time it is centred upon some revenge story.
But the lame acting by everyone onset including Travolta, leaves little to be desired in this basic revenge flick.
Heck, the second best acting I suppose would be the dog itself.
Sure I could remain seated throughout the movie but not without the occasional glance at my phone screen. I never touched the FF button in hopes for some sort of improvement but there is a limit to patience.
I basically lost interest in the movie once the dog was gone.
So anyone giving this movie a good rating must be very bland, numb, or clueless to
what makes a great western flick.
If you must watch it, just see the Trailer and leave the rest to your imagination."
" Ok, it's terrible but hey, it's Ethan Hawk and Travolta!
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,2,"Honestly watched for that reason alone--it's Hawk and Travolta...as cowboys! What's not to love? Story started out great, and Ethan ended up surprisingly carrying the whole film. But dialogue was terrible--I blame a terribly, terribly written script that wasted Travolta's talent. Dragged in places and my Dad and I literally laughed out loud by the stupid dialogue being spewed by the end. I don't think that's what the filmmakers wanted. Violence was over the top but actors lines were so bad during the violence that made it appear farcical! All the women in this film were flat out wasted. Could have used cardboard cutouts as they were given nothing to do if any value to the film. But if you want a good laugh on par with old fashioned spaghetti Western, it's worth the 2 hours."
" John Wick meets Last Train from Gun Hill
",2020-01-07 00:00:00,8,"The scheme of the hero seeking the death of his dog - as John Wick - is also close to Kirk Douglas seeking the death of his wife - in the John Sturges' film - killed by the son of the local sheriff or cattle baron - for the 1958 feature and starring Anthony Quinn. Yes, both movies cross in this tribute to the seventies western, where the killer's father - here John Travolta - and the hero have some kind of mutual respect, and the father disaprove his son behaviour. And that won't prevent them to fight against each other in the end. That's my own opinion. I love the opening credits, another tribute to Saul Bass. Very sixties."
" Precisely-Crafted Gritty Goulash
",2019-10-25 00:00:00,9,Had me transfixed from the moment it began; a precisely-crafted gritty goulash of familiar western tropes & 70s low-buck crime drama with well-defined three-dimensional characters (of both the two & four-legged variety).
" All ingredients to be a good western

" A Fine, Fun, Enjoyable Western
",2019-10-01 00:00:00,9,"In A Valley Of Violence doesn't set out to reinvent the wheel. It's a load of fun and a great homage to the classic westerns. Hawke excels and clearly has a load of fun, as do most of the other cast members. Travolta too, after a series of poor choices, even fits well in this.I won't go into to plot details because you can get the gist from trailers and such but it doesn't drag. It's pacing is perfectly setup and the score adds intensity when needed. The script is well crafted and the acting is a bit over the top from some of the other actors but it's a fine movie nonetheless.If you're a fan of westerns and good fun, In A Valley Of Violence will not let you down."
" Incredible western
",2019-08-08 00:00:00,9,"In a Valley of Violence has familiar elements from other movies but it's still an incredible western that's tense and emotional. Ethan Hawke, John Travolta, Taissa Farmiga and Karen Gillan are all great. Ti West's direction is fantastic and Jeff Grace's music is really good. It's also surprisingly funny in places."
" Great Taissa movie
",2019-07-27 00:00:00,9,"I am not big on westerns but I love Taissa Farmiga and got this movie for her. As a western goes it was all right, not great but not bad. As a 'Taissa' movie goes, it was GREAT. She is a wonderful actress and very fun to watch. She made the movie for me. There are other enjoyable parts as well, you will enjoy it. I think it was well worth it for any reason. Check it out."
" Excellent Traditional Western
",2019-06-07 00:00:00,8,"Super movie, paying homage to the genre of the western flick.
Thank you Netflix.Stranger with his dog in town stands up to a bully who takes revenge...then all hell breaks out...The canine steals the show!All the players give full throttle tongue- in-cheek performances and not a weak link in the whole picture.Great production including the opening credits and the realistic location and town depiction is brilliant:8/10"
" Simply as bad as it gets
",2019-05-16 00:00:00,1,A really bad movie. It uses the talents of good actors who are required to deliver bad dialogue and the whole effort is a poor example of direction and story. In A Valley Of Violence is simply too trivial to write about and did no service to the careers of Ethan Hawke or John Travolta. The bad continuity is unforgiveable; the lack of basic logic is merely stupid.
" Silly and Unoriginal
",2019-04-29 00:00:00,3,"Why was this even made?
a wanna be spaghetti western...Poor dialogue, caricaturesA very basic revenge plotwhat a waste - a comic book of a storyno style and no substance whatsoeverhas dog tricks! (and then the dog gets killed, which removed the most interesting character)"
" So Very Very Bad!
",2019-04-04 00:00:00,1,Bad script and bad acting. Can't imagine why someone like Ethan Hawk or Travolta would want to be associated with this movie. Did they read the script before hand? Only thing good about it is the soundtrack.
" That's what happens when you watch to many westerns
",2019-04-03 00:00:00,2,"That's what happens when you watch to many westerns and you try to do one yourself but you simply can't! Then, you take the story from another movie (John Wick) hire a couple of good actors and you think you did it, but you did not!

" Hilarious: But Not Intentionally
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,1,"This is supposed to be a serious Western; LOL. Please. Some unoriginal second-rate screenwriter got away selling a script that a first-year film student could do better. The film virtually steals from three films: A Fistful of Dollars (and uses similar graphics and musical instruments as well lol), High Noon (with almost an identical ending lol), and A Boy and His Dog (who, by the way, is far and away the most talented actor in this film). Travolta is hilarious, with his shoe-polish black hair offsetting the rest of his naturally grey hair. His characterization veers wildly from an almost-convincing first scene (except for the shoe-polish side of black hair lol) to falling back to the traditional wise-guy ""Pulp Fiction"" character, with a little bit of ""Saturday Night Fever"" (although John cannot dance in this film because we are supposed to believe he has a wooden leg). Trust me, the wood is not in the leg, but a bit higher above the shoulders.
The movie officially makes the Top 100 Turkeys of All Time (which is a very difficult list to get on) and has the potential to become a cult film. It was the funniest film I've seen so far this year; and I've seen some funny ones. You really must see it to believe it. By the way, Ethan Hawke was not able to resusitate his career, ala Clint Eastwood, with this Turkey; and Travolta has been flatlined for several years now. Instead of calling the film In a Valley of Violence, it might better be called ""In the Graveyard of Former Actors"""

It's like pineapple express but with a horse and a sombrero with a smidge ofTarantino mixed in; just a smidge though! Don't get carried away it's only a 15 age certificate remember! Oh and Ethan Hawke is in it he's in it a lot actually! But looks sad most of the time, says he wants to stop killing a lot , but still kills !?

" Pretty Good Western
",2018-11-27 00:00:00,6,"You know what, this was way better than I thought it would be. The plot is pretty standard; man with a violent past trys to avoid further violence, suffers unwarranted attack that results in death of a loved one, seeks revenge. But that's ok, Hawke grabs the part and lives it, Famigla well and truly let's us know she's here and Travolta is, well, Travolta. The first 50 minutes are the better part of the film, a believable atmosphere, good cinematography and a cracking soundtrack. The final 40 minutes are the revenge bit and there's only so much you can do with this trope. That said, unlike many recent efforts in the genre and associated thrillers, this isn't massively over the top and unbelievable so you can live it with some excitement. All in all worth a watch and a reasonable addition to the genre."

" spaghetti Wick
",2018-11-22 00:00:00,5,"Paul (Ethan Hawke) is riding to Mexico with his dog Abbie. He's a former soldier who has had enough of violence after killing Indian civilians. In the town of Denton, he is challenged to a fight by braggard Deputy Gilly Martin (James Ransone). Only after Abbie is threatened, Paul decides to knock out Gilly with one punch. Ellen (Karen Gillan) is Gilly's equally annoying girlfriend. The only friendly face is Mary-Anne (Taissa Farmiga). Gilly's father Marshal Clyde Martin (John Travolta) pushes him to leave the town and he's happy to do so. Gilly and his friends catch up to Paul and kill his dog.From the opening credits, this is trying to be a spaghetti western. The outlines of the genre is absolutely there. The problem is that everybody seems to be a bit off. Ethan Hawke is being too modern in his performance. He should really be the man with no name. As an actor, he's not great at being quiet. He's too fidgety. Compare this to Keanu Reeves in John Wick and that's what this needs. Ransone is too weak and doesn't pose a real threat. Karen Gillan is too silly. Taissa Farmiga is at least trying to do good work. Travolta is completely wrong. As I'm watching this, I keep thinking of how it could have been done right. The movie in my head is vastly better than the one on the screen."

" Good but not great
",2018-01-28 00:00:00,6,"Vastly overwritten - one of the hazards of a writer/director - and, in this case - editor, too. Oh dear... With three individuals with three different perspective, it could have been rather better.The score by Jeff Grace, although excellent in places, doesn't know if it wants to be a western or a spaghetti western (overtly Morricone) and gives conflicting messages. The movie is not quite a spaghetti western although, with a few tweaks, it could have been. Some of the scenes with SW music cues play against the on-screen action and invite a sardonic comedy perspective which isn't really justified.Some scenes are comedic although more in the style of slapstick than dark SW humour and, really, not needed.As the movie progresses, the music becomes increasingly SW and the theme of revenge - one of my absolute favourites! - comes well to the fore.But who ever heard of a 'man with no name' called Paul? Oh dear... And the town only seems to have eight inhabitants.Ethan Hawke is excellent but not quite Clint. John Travolta has lost some weight and must be desperate for parts although perhaps the script looked better than the end result.Star of the show, apart from the dog, is Taissa Farmiga who has a wonderful part and plays it well.In all, this is a nice, easy-to-watch action western. Switch off all critical facilities (and tell me how to do that!) and you'll enjoy it, but it falls needlessly short of being really great."

" Does he know any Tricks? ""He bites."" Loved the Dog!!!

He really took away from the movie. The acting by the rest of the cast members was admirable, downright excellent. The characters brought out by all were fun, refreshing, and a joy to watch....except for Travolta. : / 
Kryst! Why did it have to be Travolta?? I give the rest of the cast and crew an 8 out of 10 for this fun filled hayride.Taissa Farmiga stole the show. Holy Smoke!!! This beauty owned this movie. She's a force to be reckoned with, for sure. Keep an eye on her. She's the next Queen of Hollywood.I saw Ethan Hawke as the Lead Character & thought, ""Eh, this ain't gonna work."" Right away I'm thinking ""Before Sunset"", ""Before Sunrise"" - Movies I loved. But, Ethan as ""Clint Eastwood???"" - Ain't gonna work... But, he pulled it off in grand fashion.

" Nice exercise
",2017-11-21 00:00:00,5,"It is kind of a joke but not all that funny. It's more like a kid version of the far west. The guys in this are all a bit sissy. Several reactions are literally not natural. It makes us think though that in real life, the far west might have been more like this than tough guys films we usually see. This film has violence and blood but not over the top Ã  la Tarantino. Girls have funny roles. The whole what somewhat enjoyable. It was not as offbeat as I would have liked, in fact."
" Like having a Western dream after eating too much cheese
",2017-11-20 00:00:00,7,"In a valley of violence On face value this movie appears to be nothing more than another run of the mill western. However it soon becomes apparent that director Ti West's venture into the Wild West is much more. A rather surreal affair where characters do not act or behave like people usually do in this genre. There's a mild dose of wacky humour that is some times jarring but ultimately compels the audience to keep watching. Much of the humour works and is welcome but some of it falls flat. You can almost see the tumble weed roll by.In a valley of violence could be considered to be a loose retelling of John Wick with influences of First Blood thrown into the mix. Ex soldier wanders the land with his trusty and rather talented dog. He's turned his back on all the killing only to stumble upon the town of Denton. Here he falls foul of the marshals deputy and yes you've guessed it they snuff the poor pooch. Violence then ensues. There's some wonderful performances here. Particularly from John Travolta as the towns Marshal. He has some hilarious lines that are delivered effectively in a way only he can. Ethan Hawke is superb as the troubled hero but it's his dog Abby that steals the show. One scene that springs to mind with a blanket will melt the audiences heart. Support is strong throughout, however it is here where some of the characters behaviour is most jarring. The two girls who run the hotel seem out of place as does James Ransones character Gilly. This is not a criticism as their odd demeanour adds to the films intrigue.I commented recently when reviewing Jane got a gun that movies of this genre are becoming few and far between. So it's refreshing when a movie like this decides to honour movies of the past but yet dares to have its own unique vibe. There is plenty a nod to the greats of the genre. The opening credits and score being the most obvious.I was pleasantly surprised by this film and I don't believe it gets the recognition it deserves."
" A Strangely Interesting Movie That Works
",2017-11-20 00:00:00,6,"It's intriguing that I found this to be an interesting movie, considering that for the most part I thought it had some difficulty trying to establish what it wanted to be. Certainly it's a western - gunfights and horses and a marshal. It often feels as though it wants to be a comedy. The scenes with the drunken preacher wanting to ""save"" the town of Denton were humorous, as was a lot of the interplay between the various characters. It's most certainly a revenge story. Paul (Ethan Hawke) is out for blood after the killing of his beloved dog. And don't forget the dog. One of the cutest dogs and most talented dogs you'll ever come across in a movie - it upset me when she was killed partway through. So this is going in a lot of different directions all at once, and yet ... it does work. It's not great. It's not going to win an Oscar. But it works.Hawke was good in his role. He was believable as the lonely drifter seeking revenge after his faithful companion was taken from him for no particular reason. James Ransone as his main adversary Gilly didn't hit home quite as well with me. He was all right. I was more taken with John Travolta as the marshal - who also happened to be Gilly's father. I've seen some criticism of him - suggestions that he was miscast - but I thought he handled the part pretty well, and to be honest I was sympathetic to his character. He didn't do anything. He let Paul off the hook when he could have taken him in after he and Gilly got into a fight to start the whole thing. He told his son and his buddies not to go after Paul - and he wasn't happy when they defied him and did it anyway. He didn't deserve his fate.It's not a lavish movie. The sets are pretty barebones - and the opening credits were bizarre. They reminded me of the opening credits of a 1960's TV show somehow and kind of lowered my expectations from the start of what I should expect. But the movie exceeded those expectations once it got started. I also appreciated that in the end there was no attempt to introduce a romance into the story. Had there been one it surely would have been between Paul and Mary Anne (Taissa Farmiga.) The problem would have been that Mary Anne was supposed to be 16 years old. I suppose in the context of the Old West a romance between them wouldn't have been shocking - but given the current climate in Hollywood, it's probably best that the movie didn't go in that direction. This just turned out to be a pretty decent and interesting movie. (6/10)"
" low budget
",2017-11-20 00:00:00,3,"Watched it last night, and the first thing that struck me was how cheaply made it was. It reminded me of Arnolds ""Aftermath"". A rented lot, a shoestring budget, a bare bones story, a trite script, all amounting to an insult to the viewing public. Its OK for stars to make a movie to make money, but at least make a good movie, the gratuity was palpable. The trend was first noticed on films with Bruce Willis, who I now call the cameo kid, for some reason he doesn't care anymore, and just takes the cheque. There was an upside, and a surprising one, Taissa Farmiga, who acted everyone off the screen. The lady has instinct, the ability and enthusiasm to inject originality, on the hoof. The trend is disturbing, go back to quality, it delights and in the process makes money."
" Just stop killing dogs in movies. Stop it. Stop it NOW!!!
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,2,"Because I am sick and tired of it, and it is exploited for sympathy or motivation for killing -- it is pure manipulation of the audience, not unlike tying an adorable toddler to railroad tracks in front of an oncoming locomotive. It's cheap thrills. It's disgusting.I am tired of renting movies, only to find out that any cute animal in the film is going to be brutally killed along the way, simply as exploitation. I think why it galls me so much here, is that I saw the opening, and the cute dog, and then the titles, which FEATURE the cute dog running around being cute and doing tricks, so I figured ""they wouldn't feature the dog if they were going to cause it harm"". Stupid me.Generally I refuse to watch films with violence to animals, on principal, but I never heard of this third rate direct-to-video cheapie, and I thought maybe it would be OK. I was wrong. It is not OK.It's basically an attempt to remake one of those cheap, spaghetti westerns of the 60s -- right down the titles, which are an homage of 60s style -- but update the flippant language and graphic violence to the present day. Frankly, I never much liked spaghetti westerns in the first place, but at least 50 years ago, the violence was cartoonish.Here its buckets of blood, slashed throats and of course -- dog murder.It doesn't make things better that Abby (Jumpy) is about the cutest, cleverest best trained dog I've seen in films or on TV in a long time -- she could be the next Lassie or something. She steals every scene with and out-acts protagonist Ethan Hawke (she out-acts John Travolta, too, but that's a low bar to clear). Because she is SO adorable and the camera (and crew and cast) clearly adore her....they focus on her so much, she stops being an ""animal"" and becomes the film's HEROINE....only to see her brutally killed in a sickening way.I'm sorry folks, but that is not entertainment. And I won't pay for it or watch it (by choice) and I will tell anyone in hearing distance to stay far, far away from this pathetic piece of garbage. No surprise this went direct to video. And how desperate are Ethan Hawke and John Travolta, who used to be A-list actors? They are a bit older, but look fine -- they clearly could do better stuff than this. If I were forced to this level of degradation in my career, I'd hang up my spurs & retire. 2 stars solely for Abby (Jumpy) giving an Oscar level performance, and to her trainer. What a sweetie! I'm just sorry I had to see her in this, and because I will never see her parts in this film again, because this film is an abomination that will never enter my home again."
" The Denton Rapscallion.
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,7,"In a Valley of Violence is written and directed by Ti West. It stars Ethan Hawke, Taissa Farmiga, James Ransome, Karen Gillan and John Travolta. Music is by Jeff Grace and cinematography by Eric Robbins.Ethan Hawke plays Paul, an ex soldier accompanied only by his dog, Abbie, who is drifting across the desert towards Mexico. Stopping off in the dying town of Denton, Paul finds trouble that will have consequences for himself and town alike.Ti West is more well known for his horror ventures, where although divisive in that genre sphere, he can be proud of his success rate. Here he tackles the Western, and true to form, he homages past genre masters whilst unmistakably putting his own stamp on things. Opening with credits straight out of Spaghetti Western land, and introducing us to a musical score that will accompany the story that is wonderfully feverish, West is in no hurry for blood and bone shenanigans. He always favours the slow burn and so it proves here.There's nothing remotely new here, it's a standard tale of a gunman - one damaged by his war efforts - who through circumstance is forced to abandon his hope of a quiet life. He's a loner man of few words, thus giving viewers a classic Western character staple, an anti-hero to root for and for us to yearn for him to find peace. When the violence comes, it's sharp and bloody, but often there is humour as well, deftly inserted into proceedings, whilst the canine is skillful and a key character to all and sundry.Perfs are more than adequate. Hawke sifts seamlessly into being a believable drifter type of complexity, Ransome is annoyingly brattish, but that's actually job well done, and Travolta - sporting a wooden leg - gets better once (and if) you buy into him in this setting. Gillan isn't given much to do, but lands some decent emotive punches, but it's Farmiga who stands out as Mary-Anne. She's utterly infectious and thankfully she gets a well written part, that of a young woman trying to hold her own in the most trying of township circumstance.The purpose built town of Denton looks just that!, but this is off- set a touch by the nice location landscapes (Santa Fe, New Mexico), and with the story working from solid genre foundations then this is a pleasure - without pulling up any trees - for fans of such. 7/10"
" Witty, clever, different, and VERY fun
",2017-09-19 00:00:00,8,"This film is ostensibly a ""western."" But it is more than that.For starters, it isn't a modern version of a western, but instead is more akin to the old spaghetti westerns. The music, the sets, the graphics, etc., are both an homage to spaghetti westerns and a humorous take-off on them.The plot is one you have seen in many westerns. A drifter comes into a small town that is controlled by a psychopath, conflict ensues, and there is a gun battle where the drifter ""saves"" the town.On one level that is all this is. On another, it is a wry, and dry, take-off on this old, familiar tale because in this film the drifter doesn't go after the town bullies to liberate the town but because they killed his dog.That's right. This is a film where the battle-hardened, killer hero is mush when his dog is killed. He cries.So, right there, you don't have a traditional western or a traditional spaghetti western. In NO OTHER western I have ever seen (hundreds, as I am a die-hard fan) has the hero ever cried. Even Nathan Brittles wasn't crying in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon when he went to his wife's grave.This guy cries and then exacts his revenge.Now, Ethan Hawk is great in this. Just a week earlier we had seen the (dreadful) remake of The Magnificent Seven, which he is also in. However, this film, In a Valley of Violence, is far superior. In Mag 7 II, the town ""bully"" has hundreds of hired gunmen, all of whom meet their deaths in about 20 minutes. It is so absurd as to be ridiculous.In Valley, there are 4, maybe 5, and none of them are even close to competent, or even scary. There is a bully, his dad, and three guys who just needed a job because they couldn't do anything else.And the gun battle is hilarious. You realize, while watching this film, that you have been had. It starts off to be a standard western, and slowly evolves into rib splitting humor as you watch the gun ""battle"" unfold. The dialogue is clever. And the humor doesn't beat you over the head. In fact, it is understated, which makes it even better.We enjoyed this film. We will watch it again. Just give it a chance. It will be especially rewarding for people who have a history with old-fashioned westerns, as it is a wry, dry take-off on them that pounds you with subtlety and intelligent humor.Enjoy, pilgrim!"
" My name is Lawrence
",2017-09-15 00:00:00,6,"Paul (Ethan Hawke) is some specially trained soldier who has deserted his wife and daughter for ""what he has done"" to run off to Mexico with his dog. He makes a pit stop at the town of Denton where he is forced to beat up Gilly (James Ransone) the town bully and deputy and also son of the Marshall (John Travolta). Then through a series of circumstances this becomes a formula, clichÃ© filled revenge film. Paul gets the help of Mary Anne (Taissa Farmiga) a talkative girl who has a thing for him. Karen Gillan who is top billed has a smaller role as her sister and girlfriend of Gilly.This is not a great film, although I found it strangely entertaining, like watching a train wreak. The characters were written poorly and I wondered how these top names were coerced to make a film I would expect to see Eric Roberts. Ethan Hawke spends the entire film in a mental fog. The final killing was a formula ""twist"" that I saw coming from 30 minutes into the film. And what was with the dishonest preacher? (Burn Gorman) Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
" My Dog Don't Like You Laughin' At Him.
",2017-08-31 00:00:00,2,"Ethan Hawke and his dog ride into a dusty Western town with a population of no more than ten, stop at the local bar for a quiet drink, and Ethan is insulted by a a wan and villainous young man in black, is challenged to a fist fight, knocks the bad guy out with one blow, is warned by the marshal, John Travolta, to leave town and never return, does so, but that night is attacked by the loudmouthed braggart in black and three of his friends, who kill his beloved dog and throw Ethan Hawke over a cliff. Hawke returns and kills them all.That's about all the attention this chimera deserves.But, being a generous kinda guy myself, I'll note that there are two professional performances in the movie. There is John Travolta, who does quite well as the crippled and common sensical sheriff, and the dog. This is the kind of dog that would melt the heart of anyone except the braggart in black and his accomplices. The dog responds to Hawke's comments as if with a fully blown Wernicke's area. He covers his face with a paw when shamed. He goes out and fetches kindling for the camp fire. He investigates strange noises at night without barking, for fear of waking his master. Taissa Farmiga, Vera's sister, is a lonely widow of sixteen. She's appealing in the way that some nineteenth-century dolls are cute but it's impossible to judge her acting chops because the role of desperate chatterbox has her so completely hemmed in.James Ransone as the baddie in black, and Karen Gillan as a housemistress at the hotel, are unspeakably bad. Gillan gives a performance of the sort you might find in a high school play in East Windsor Township, New Jersey, but Ransone is even worse. My God, he's outrageous -- sneering, shrieking, blustering, and otherwise engaging in what's usually called ""overacting."" He's not helped at all by the script, which introduces some romantic comedy exchanges about pregnancy into what is otherwise a thoroughly dramatic situation."
" An Okay Western
",2017-08-30 00:00:00,6,"This was a veiled attempt to recreate a Clint Eastwood character of the spaghetti westerns for which Mr. Eastwood realized great fame and success in the 1960's. Simply put, Ethan Hawke isn't Clint Eastwood. My greatest criticism of the movie is inappropriate dialogue for the time depicted in the film. I have several examples of verbiage not suited for the time period, but I will leave that to be experienced by the viewer. Some of the violence seemed to be a little overcooked. Though Hawke did a credible job as the lead character, his performance did not rise to the level of Travolta. Dog Abbie probably gave the best performance in the movie; however, all of the supporting actors did well in their respective roles."
" Boring Western
",2017-08-22 00:00:00,3,The half half has some promise.It just gets a little boring after awhile.There's little character development from the main character. The act of revenge and execution is not stylish enough. And the jokes are not funny enough and seem in odd places. I can see that is a very low budget movie with so few extras in the town.3/10.
" A fresh and sometimes funny approach to a Western
",2017-07-19 00:00:00,9,An original Western with a difference. It's funny exciting and involving in a way that feels fresh. The top notch cast helps too.The modern aspect is the funny dialog that pops up when least expected. Ethan Hawke is quite convincing as a conflicted soldier with a talented dog in tow. John Travolta as the Marshall is good in the Western genre - something I didn't expect at all. Taissa Farmiga is cute and feisty here.The quirkiness isn't over the top like Quentin Tarrantino - it actually fits into the story quite well.Highly recommended.
" Great Western!
",2017-07-16 00:00:00,10,"Glad I ignored the haters and watched this movie. This was a unique kind of western with some techniques I've never seen before, yet it kept much of the flavor of a 60's western. John Travolta should do more westerns because it fit him really well. He was a natural at it as if he had just stepped out of Tombstone. E.H. was great too. A great western and I didn't want it to end I liked it so much. A must see movie!"
" In a Valley of Restrain
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,8,"In his horror films Ti West is master of restrain. Here he tackles the age-old (and not exclusively) western tale of the mysterious stranger who passes through a ""closed-society"" type of town, reshuffling the cards in the process and putting himself and its residents into the test. West's distinctive style works just as effectively here. Genre clichÃ©s are refreshingly overturned with subtle humor and canine honesty. A solid, well-honed, well-crafted film."
" Dreadful
",2017-06-13 00:00:00,2,"This movie is terrible. The dialogue is completely incongruous with the 'characters '. Completely predictable, lacking any suspense or interest. The only redeeming feature except to laugh at is some decent music. I can't believe Ethan Hawke and John Travolta made this movie. It is almost as bad as Battlefield Earth."
" An enjoyable modern Spaghetti-style Western
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,7,"In a Valley of Violence stars Ethan Hawke as a wandering deserter, Paul, who happens upon the town of Denton. Run by a tough but fair Marshall, and his psychotic son and cronies, the town has seen better days. Paul is just looking to pick up some supplies for his journey to Mexico, but runs afoul of the Marshall's son. He tries his best not to become involved, but soon finds himself gunning for revenge in a town that needs saving.This was a well made Western heavily stylized after many classic Spaghetti Westerns. It had many campy elements, and presented a lower budget sheen that really nails the Spaghetti Western feel. The acting was competently done, with some moments feeling cheesy and slightly comical, and others offering some heart. The direction was solid, with scenes, close ups, vistas and so on handled with care. The story itself was predictable, but far from bland. The relationship between Paul and his dog, Abbey, was especially well done. All in all, this was a fun and campy Western very much paying homage to the Spaghetti Westerns of the '60's and '70's. It is worthy of a watch for those interested in Western films, and certainly for fans of the more campy Spaghetti films."
" You should never shoot a man's dog...
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,6,"Normally I am not overly keen on western movies, as they pretty much tend to be sculpted from the same mould. But still, I was given the chance to sit down to watch ""In a Valley of Violence"" and with Ethan Hawke as one of the lead actors, I thought that it might actually be worth the watch.And it turned out that ""In a Valley of Violence"" actually was quite good. Sure, it did follow that standard blueprint of how-to-make-a-western-movie, but still it managed to squeeze enough contents into the storyline and plot to make it somewhat different than many other westerns.The story, albeit quite generic, turned out to be entertaining enough. Sure, it was simplistic to the point where you could just entirely switch off your brain and still keep up with the movie, but it still turned out to be adequate entertainment.""In a Valley of Violence"" doesn't really offer much new to the genre, nor does it revolutionize it in any way. Director Ti West cashed in on a formula already well-established and well-used in other movies, and managed to make it different enough to work out in favor of this movie.Ethan Hawke actually did quite a good job in the lead role, and it was nice to see him perform in a western movie. He was carrying most of the movie all by himself, and did so quite well. I was initially a bit hesitant about John Travolta in a movie such as this, but he nailed it here, as he was quite convincing in the role that he had.I am sure that ""In a Valley of Violence"" will be quite pleasing to fans of the western genre, especially when a non-fan such as myself happened to be quite entertained with the movie as a whole."
" Nothing new here. And that's fine.
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,8,"I read some reviews here criticizing this movie as too much of a satire, so I went in with a cautious mind. I surely didn't want a straight-up comedy or a movie that has too much commentary about its genre. I'm happy to say that ""In a Valley of Violence"" is played very straight, it's a traditional loner western with a revenge plot.There is nothing quite new here, and you'll see plenty of clichÃ©s played out. Which suggests that Ti West wanted to pay homage to traditional, small-scaled westerns. So if you want something profound or fresh to challenge your intellect, you'd want to look elsewhere.But there is something to this film. Most of the characters, despite not having much depth, are fun to follow. They have that certain spark to them, most of them are over the top and very on-the-nose. It doesn't reach Tarantino-levels in the way these characters are portrayed, but the fact that this comparison even came to my mind is telling. You don't get that invested in the characters, but you start to enjoy them nonetheless - which is good, because the movie is carried by this weird little group of people. The scale is small, and there are only a few people on the screen, so it's that much more important. Ti West's other movie ""The Innkeepers"" had the same element to it, and he just might be a pretty good director concerning characters, making them even remotely interesting when the premise or material doesn't help.Actors are fine. My favorite was Taissa Farmiga, who was a sweet blabbermouth. Even John Travolta did fine, and Tommy Nohilly was good too. James Ransone was absolutely hamming it up at times, which was a nice contrast to Ethan Hawke who played it straight. Ethan Hawke doesn't have much of a range here, and he's not supposed to either, but he always delivers just by his mere presence. He's one of those actors I just enjoy watching, no matter the movie, and this one is no exception. Karen Gillan was certainly having fun with her role, as most people did. Perhaps that's it, the charm this movie had: people were having fun and some of it translated to the screen. Otherwise the movie would have been very dry. Oh yeah, and the dog helped too.There's something to be said about cinematography in Ti West's films (although I've only seen three). There is something intimate and warm to it. Nothing feels pretentious or grand, but at the same time not too familiar either. They're easy on the eye in a lovely way. I hope Ti West makes more films, I'm starting to get interested.""In a Valley of Violence"" isn't deep. It's probably a love letter to simple westerns, and isn't trying to do anything what it can't achieve. For this movie that particular approach works well. It's a simple story about simple characters with some weird charm to it. It's not very engaging, but I found it very enjoyable nonetheless. There is nothing cynical about this movie, even though we've seen this story a thousand times, and it warmed my heart. If you like simple, confined movies and you're willing to adjust your expectations, this might be worth the shot for you too."
" A Well-Acted, Exciting Western
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,8,"In a Valley of Violence follows a travelling cowboy who, after stopping by a small town, unintentionally starts conflict among the more powerful members there. Let's start with the obvious part: Ethan Hawke. He's fantastic, as per usual. I don't think I've ever not been impressed by this guy, and that trend continues here. John Travolta pulls off a solid performance as well, playing one of the most interesting characters in the movie. And James Ransone does the same, pulling off a good ol' western hothead. Personally I don't think that Taissa Farmiga was very fit for this role, but she did her best and thankfully fails to take anything of significance away from the movie. The writing is good as well. The movie builds the characters and conflict for a while before anything of real significance happens, and it makes it all the more effective. It excels at building tension, making the last 40 minutes of this movie just that much better. Speaking of the last 40 minutes, they're awesome. After an hour of solid build up, we are treated with some great western action. It's tense and exciting, yet not over-the-top. It's just right. Overall I really enjoyed In a Valley of Violence. The acting, writing, and action are all great, and in the end I would definitely recommend it."
" ""I'm here for the men who killed my dog.""
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,10,"That's right. Look, you can't just kill someone's pet and expect to get away with it. Clint Eastwood found that out when he snuffed a little girl's pet turtle in ""The Beguiled"". Fair warning, don't eat the fancy mushrooms.There's no way this movie should be a '10' but I'm giving it a '10' anyway just because it has so many haters, and even more so, I had a blast watching it. Yeah, I know, all the clichÃ©'s apply and you could predict virtually everything that was going to happen, but what's so bad about that? Ethan Hawke brings an entirely nuanced and understated menace to the role of Paul No Last Name, speaking surreptitiously to his dog Abby about his past life with wife Cathy and daughter Abigail. We never do find out what happened to them, but it must have been bad. Real bad. So bad the screen writers couldn't mention it. Use your imagination.Watching James Ransone as the idiot son of Marshal Martin (John Travolta) reminded me of how over the top Skip Homeier could have been if he was guided by a modern day director like Tarantino, or in this case, Ti West. Talk about an inability to foresee unintended consequences. Of course, there's no reason our man Paul should have ever come back after falling off that cliff, but hey, he had to avenge poor Abby. What Gilly did was pretty sick, Homeier would have just shot Paul.You know, I like Travolta as a bad guy, as he ages he seemed well cast for his role here. He even managed to put a little cowardice into his role as the Denton town Marshal, pushing 'don't call me Tubby' into a corner and watching as Paul took him out as victim number three. Besides a thousand other Westerns with a revenge motive, this one reminded me an awful lot of ""Straw Dogs"" without the bear trap. Take your pick, the original or the remake, they both offered a protagonist who didn't know when to quit.With some of the serio-comic sensibility of 1995's ""The Quick and the Dead"", I thought this was quite the entertaining little Western flick. Some time down the road I'll probably revise my ten rating, but for know it just makes me feel good to do it. Glad to see also that the dog playing Abby got a screen credit for some nice work in the picture. Sure beats being a turtle."
" Too much a love letter, too little attention to detail
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,4,"Ethan Hawke and John Travolta are great in this movie. But everyone else overacts and chews the scenery, something I'd have preferred to see from the leads. It's as if every other actor is star-struck and trying to match the two. If only the director guided them to being a bit more subtle. The story wants to explain itself all too often and is too keen to show off all of its dialog. Even Hawke's character, which is the silent type, at times talks a ridiculous amount.This film is a love letter to spaghetti westerns, as the title sequence and score make obvious. From how it is shot to the characteristic faces of extras - it's all from the spaghetti play book. Sadly it lacks the mood and nuance of the genre, where less is more."
" Halfway then none
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,3,"A fun movie until the dog dies, the rest is buffalo chips. Not funny, overacted, John T sucks, Ethan is the only thing carrying the movie. Ugh, John T needs to retire and the guy that played his son should never get another role. Ugh, ugh, and ugh. I could have written a better script and I'm an autistic quadriplegic with cerebral palsy."
" Bad just bad
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,1,"Do not watch this movie SPOILER but they kill the dog a few minutes in, not only do they kill the dog but they brutally and disgustingly murder it. The whole movie could have been 20 minutes. The directing is atrocious. The plot is predicable and weak. And Ethan hawk grovels and begs so much you just want to see him die almost. 1:44 minutes I'm not getting back, totally bummed about that. And that I wasted my money. Cliff notes version, disgusting bad directing, acting, and plot. Shame on the people that made this movie, SHAME SHAME SHAME"
" A town run by sinners
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,3,"The film opening titles reminds you of the Sergio Leone westerns which means Ethan Hawke's stoic, smelly, mystery drifter accompanied by his loyal dog is basically Clint Eastwood's the man with no name and a past that haunts him.In the saloon Hawke is taunted by a loud mouth who is also the Marshall's son and he gets beaten up by Hawkes and then goes out for revenge which includes killing Hawke's dog and leaving Hawke for dead. Bad mistake because just like John Wick, killing his dog means he is now out for vengeance.John Travolta has a supporting role as the Marshall trying to find a compromise but he overindulged his idiot son too much as the town is a hovel and its inhabitants afraid.This should had been a lean mean western but suddenly becomes flabby and verbose when Hawke's needed to be bad-ass. It is too clichÃ©d which some of its western tropes and underlying humour cannot compensate for."
" Not Entertaining
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,2,"Paul (Ethan Hawke) is deserter from the Civil War probably on the Union side, had abandoned his wife and child and is heading to Mexico and we are not sure why. He encounters the Marshal (John Travolta) and his son Gilly (James Ransone) and the boys. The Marshall runs the town and his son Gilly is a bully. Nothing good comes from this encounter and later Paul's dog is killed. Now Paul knows what he must do. This tries very hard to be a spaghetti western and fails. There is no good music that would normally accompany a spaghetti western. See? Yes, it's that bad. The script is okay, but the way lines are delivered makes one cringe. The dialogues are unbelievably bad with exceptions: John Travolta's and Ethan Hawke's dialogues are the only ones that are passable. And to be fair, Travolta's dialogues are sometimes humorous and you get the feeling he enjoyed every utterance. All other dialogues are off the charts and this is hard to explain, but one needs to hear them to understand what I mean. It's almost embarrassing to watch and listen to. Really not sure whey Ethan Hawke and John Travolta are in this. Did they owe money? Were their families threatened? Inquiring minds want to know. Now the only good parts in here are the shoot-outs in the town that come later on. Here it's sometimes quite comical even though people are getting shot. But when the last bad guy gets his, the violence is harsh, not comical. We are not sure what this movie was all about, but definitely not a spaghetti western. Notables: Karen Gillan as Ellen, Gilly's girlfriend; and Taissa Farmiga as Mary-Anne the sister of Ellen. Both sisters work in the hotel.All in all this is not entertaining. In the beginning, we thought this would be a good western as Paul meets a drunken priest (Ben Gorman) who claims he needs Paul's horse. The priest is here as comical relief, but nothing was funny. So we were wrong. The priest shows up again at the end when Paul tells him he can now stay and save everyone. Still not funny. (2/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes."
" A Good Way to Spend an Afternoon
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,7,"This movie does not have a lot of surprises, as others have said, but it is also quite an enjoyable low budget western. It pays homage to old spaghetti westerns in many ways.The characters are morally ambiguous, the music is sparse but high quality. The pacing is a little slow in spots but I found the acting to be pretty good and most of the characters are fun to watch. The movie strikes a nice balance between pulpy and gritty and even has a few moments of humor. While, as the title implies, there is some violence, it's not a gore-fest or an over the top shoot 'em up. In many ways, it's the essence of a western.So in the end, it's not earth shattering or anything, but it is a solid movie. If you prefer to take your time with a film and are a little worn out by shaky-cam non-stop action, this film is worth checking out."
" Screw the haters, this is a real fine Western
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,7,"If you are a fan of classic Westerns, you'll find yourself glued to the screen enjoying every minute of this film. Disclosure: I am 62 years old as I write this, so I've seen 'em all. And watching this one, I couldn't help feel like it was 1967, or thereabouts, what with the steady camera-work, the superb cinematography capturing all the dusty glory of New Mexico, U.S.A. And the soundtrack! Not some canned muzak, not some minimalist guitar scratchings, but a full-blown beauty of a musical composition that took me right back to the Spaghetti classics. Now, this won't win an Oscar, but dang if it didn't make my Friday night popcorn and beer movie night.""In A Valley of Violence"" is a total winner. p.s....the dog is an unbelievably good actor."
" I really should be giving this a four out of ten...
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,5,"What a fail. I'm not sure if they just didn't have enough money to pay for a few extras but it keeps you wondering the whole time while watching this. Yeah, why did they waste the budget on the A-listers in this? They could have made a better film with just one Hollywood heavy hitter and more extras and etc, etc. They story isn't remarkable enough to keep your mind from noticing all the production limitations. I hope this was a paycheck gig for everyone involved because it really isn't worth watching because the production value is nothing. I don't even feel like this deserves to be a movie because it comes off as band camp or some art nerd's last minute film school project for a class or something. Did the people involved owe the director a favor or something? The dog is amazing in this. He does tricks, barks, maybe he talked while I nodded off, who knows? Two out of whatever stars I am going to rate this movie go to that freaking dog. But seriously, you should skip this if it ever comes on TV."
" Great film. The best western since Mannaja.
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,10,"In a Valley of Violence is a great film. The best western since Mannaja. In a Valley of Violence, Ethan Hawke stars as a former soldier turned drifter whom sets out to get his revenge on the arrogant son of a town marshal when he kills his dog, after the marshal orders the drifter to leave town and his son disobeys his father's order to leave him alone, after the drifter beats him up in a fight. The film reminded me so much of First Blood and John Wick. I believe In A Valley of Violence to be a remake of both films. The cast especially Ethan Hawke, John Travolta, Karen Gillan and John Ransome all gave outstanding awesome performances and I think both Karen Gillan and John Travolta deserve to be nominated for Oscars for their supporting performances in the film. Karen Gillan stands out the most as Gilly's snobby wife Ellen. The film's main antagonist Gilly is truly one of the nastiest characters in cinematic history and he truly deserved to die. In a Valley of Violence is truly one of the greatest westerns ever made. 100 minutes of entertaining, brutality, blood and violence. If you enjoyed westerns such as Hannie Caulder (1971), High Plan Drifter (1973), Mannaja (1977), Django Unchained (2012) and The Magnificent Seven (2016) and if you are fans of Ethan Hawke, John Travolta and Karen Gillan, I recommend this film and I think it's worth adding to the DVD collection."
" Generic but Fun B-Western...Good Cast Deserted by Mundane Dialog
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,7,"The Writer/Director Ti West Relies on a Tarantino Trope too Heavily and does not have the Writing Chops to Pull it Off and Compares Poorly to the QT Schicht of Long Dialog Exchanges before Bursting into Violence. It is a Weakness so Glaring that it Stops the Film Cold Frequently.This Spaghetti Western Homage does have some B-Movie Charm. Minimalist and Moving in Parts, Funny and Absurd, it uses some Good Low-Brow Actors like Ethan Hawke, James Ransone, Taissa Farmiga, and John Travolta (who almost steals the show).Abby The Dog, doesn't quite Steal the Show but in the First Two Acts manages the Part of Partner/Side-Kick Affectionately and Admirably.Predictable in the Extreme there are No Surprises or Cinematic Flourishes and in a Genre so Well Worn that is a Disappointment. Two Recent Modern Westerns are Examples how that is Possible, almost Necessary, in the New Millennium. ""Bone Tomahawk"" (2015) and ""Slow West"" (2015).Overall, Fun Low-Budget Film that is Generic but Good and should Please Western Movie Fans."
" The predictable valley
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,7,"At least ""In a Valley of Violence"" is not as agonizingly predictable as the director's previous waste of time. I am someone who believes that a movie without one single moment you couldn't imagine after reading a one sentence, or even one word, description of the plot, is a movie you have no reason to watch.How is it that you know the name Ti West? A guy whose movies are as formulaic as these should be directing episodes of Big Bang Theory. But he does do them well, and gives his superior actors room to breathe. The problem is that he ""writes"" these movies himself â€“ if you can call stringing a bunch of clichÃ©s together ""writing"".This is a movie that is so predictable that you don't notice the genre clichÃ©s that would have rubbed you wrong in a better movie, i.e.. the main character being the typical hard-bitten and reluctant hero type who doesn't say much, who never intended to draw steel but ended up being forced to. And how about the town being basically just two rows of houses with a ""main street"" running down the middle? Is there a ""saloon"" with rooms to rent upstairs? How about a plucky young heroine who dreams of escape and thinks the hero might be her ticket out? He doesn't take her at first. Of course.No, it was the smaller details that rubbed me wrong. For example: before killing his first victim, why does the typically terse hero suddenly become insanely verbose, rabbiting on like someone who has truly lost control of himself? What was the point of the speech where he outlines exactly what he's doing as if it wasn't already completely obvious, not only to the audience, but also the victim? And when the bad guy has the plucky heroine up against the wall with a gun to her throat, and he begins threatening her, what does she do next? Her response is engraved in stone, alongside the ""all towns in Westerns are just two rows of houses with a street down the middle"" rule, in a tablet enshrined in the Screenwriters' Guild bathroom. When the camera focused on the heroine's determined eyes in the climax, I cringed. This is West relying not only on clichÃ©, but on the trend of the day: girl power.Having read this far, you might wonder why I didn't give the film a lower rating. The answer is that for all the predictability, ""In a Valley of Violence"" has actors who you can't help watching and rooting for, especially Taissa Farmiga, one of the best young actors in the world, who gives this tired material more energy than it deserves."
" Slightly disappointing
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,6,"For the fans of old spaghetti westerns In A valley Of Violence will do the job I guess. I did like those movies when I was young and would probably still like them if I watched them again. But I had higher hopes for this movie. Especially with the cast. Ethan Hawke & John Travolta together in a western I thought it had some promises. The beginning credits are all promising. Back to the roots of spaghetti westerns, but the movie itself lacks a bit of je-ne-sais-quoi. The story is very predictable with the good retiring killer meeting the bad villains in a terrorized city in the middle of nowhere. And of course at one point there is revenge. Like I said it's very predictable and not very original. Add on that that the acting could have been much better and you get just a movie worth watching once. I won't watching it a second time like I do with other classics in this genre."
" Absurdist Western...two words I never thought I would combine.
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,6,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS - Absurdism at its core is the belief that human beings exist in a purposeless, chaotic universe. Anything can happen at any time and there's no discernible reason why it happened.That is very much this movie. The events that occur in this movie, the dialogue that is said in this movie, the relationships that exist in this movie sometimes make no sense to the audience. Why are these characters friendly? Why in the hell is there a casual conversation happening during a gunfight? Why start killing people THAT VIOLENTLY over a dog? Who is this random priest character and why does he come back?! These were questions that I had throughout this entire film and frankly they will never be answered. That being said, this was one of the most fun Westerns I have seen in quite a while. Ethan Hawke and John Travolta give great performances as a drifter and sheriff respectfully and have great chemistry when they are on screen together. The other actors in this movie were...not as good. The two sisters' actions were unable to be explained even from an absurdist standpoint with rushed line delivery and questionable acting choices throughout the movie. The sheriff's son and his posse were much better, but sometimes got too caught up in their characters for their own good. In the end, this is a film that has humour, decent action, and handles its absurdity well. But the poor acting by the supporting cast and the overall time (this movie was a solid 20 minutes too long in my opinion) keep it from living to its full potential."
" Strange but entertaining: not what you expect
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,6,"This was a strange movie. Hawke and his dog were a cute and likable pair.....too cute and too likable. At first it seemed like a family movie but that changed. I felt that Hawke's characters emotional isolation (apart from his relationship with his animals) could have been expanded upon. That could have been interesting. Everything else in the movie was quite predictable. Whilst the movie had quite a few negatives for me I still found it entertaining and it was an enjoyable summer 'veg' out watch for me. What's not to like about a very clever lovable dog, the loving human and dog bond and Ethan Hawke's face. He is very suited to Westerns."
" a pleasure for genre fans
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,7,"Considering this is basically what Ti West cooked up following a double viewing of John Wick and any given Sergio Corbucci flick, it's... really f***** good! Damn I'll just go ahead and say it: I was more entertained by this than John Wick (some of that I simply chalk up to Hawke being a more emotional and curious presence than Reeves, personal preference, and beyond the premise and some key moments it's not exactly the same as that).This is no masterpiece or anything, and I don't necessarily think it was trying to be. West clearly loves this genre, and wants to do his own twist on it, which carries some especially graphic violence (if you had trouble with movies like The Thing, don't watch this), and some strong supporting work from Karen Gillan and John Travolta (the guy who plays Travolta's son, the real main bad-guy, is one note but the actor plays him for all his worth).This kind of well-produced, surprisingly and wildly funny straight-faced homage western (especially near the super intense and, as the title says, violent climax, that threw me for a loop, such as everything with the one guy who protests being called by his nickname by John Travolta and demands to be called 'Lawrence') is something that pleases me. If it's ever on TV I'll stop and watch it. 7.5/10"
" In the old west, it's always about the revenge!
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,6,"Believe it or not, this is the western version of 'John Wick'. Same storyline except it takes place in the desert of the old west. A man who had enough killing native Americans, is now abandoned everything and heading towards Mexico for a fresh start. But on a way in a small town, he gets into a trouble. After surviving the assault, he goes back to hunt them all and like most of the western film, the end is predictable.This is not a bad flick, but it was not fresh enough, either its story or the gun fights. With a bunch of decent actors, a decently made film. The characters were limited, the atmosphere was like deserted. So the overall narration was focused on a few characters in its entire 100 minute run. I felt sorry for Travolta, they did not get anything out of him, he just had a presence and nothing else. In other hand Ethan was okay, but his role was designed as an average man in the old west, not a powerful one as we expect in this type of film.The title says it all, but it was not that ruthless as compared to the most of the similar western films I have seen. Mostly it will bring a disappointment for its viewers, but definitely a few would enjoy it for its simpleness. For me, it was an average, but thought it could have been better, particularly in the gun battle. So it's nothing more than just once watchable with a low expectation.6/10"
" What I most love about the film, is that it's an animal abuse revenge tale!
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,9,"'IN A VALLEY OF VIOLENCE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Another dog revenge tale (which reminds me of 2014's 'JOHN WICK'), this one is a western starring Ethan Hawke (making it his second western of 2016, following 'THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN' remake). It was written, edited, co-produced and directed by Ti West; and it costars James Ransone, John Travolta, Taissa Farmiga and Karen Gillen. The film tells the tale of a drifter, in the Old West, that gets into some conflict with some small town folk, that then kill his dog, and he wants revenge. The film received a limited indie theatrical release, while also being made available on video on demand, and it got mostly positive reviews from critics. I really enjoyed it as well.Paul (Hawke) is an ex-soldier, and drifter, that's traveling to Mexico (in the Old West), with his dog Abbie. They decide to cut through a small town, called Denton, despite being warned that it's an unfriendly place, by a drunken priest (Bum Gorman). Once there, a Deputy, named Gilly Martin (Ransone), picks a fight with Paul. Paul then humiliates him, by knocking him out. Later Gilly, and his friends, seek out revenge on Paul; by killing Abbie and leaving Paul for dead. Paul survives the attack though, and he then wants revenge (on his attackers) for the death of his best friend.I love a good western, especially a traditional homage to the genre like this! I also really like Ethan Hawke, and I've enjoyed Ti West's other films, which have all been horror flicks before this, and I think this is his best work to date. The score is great, and the action scenes are all pretty awesome. What I most love about the film though, is it's an animal abuse revenge tale. I'm a passionate vegan, and an obsessive animal lover, and I really like movies like this; that treat animals as they should be treated, like equals. The film should become a popular cult classic.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/B4EI2AvkLgo"
" Despite being as predictable as a rainstorm, it wins for entertainment
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,8,"I like Ethan Hawke and I like John Travolta or used to and I love Westerns so I thought I'd give this a shot. Another reviewer said the cast was good but the script could have been written by a Grade School class and that isn't out of the question. They take all the most stereotypical aspects of Westerns to the point where its almost spoofing. It uses elements from every Sergio Leone Wester, High Plains Drifter, First Blood, John Wick and it drives home that point. At times you feel like it's almost laughable BUT the cast is very good. They seem to be taking it very seriously and it makes the film watchable. It might be one of the only movies I've seen that is equally ridiculous as it does serious and entertaining. It has some genuinely outrageous moments and yet you still somehow buy into it. It's almost stunning to watch it unfold.Ethan Hawke is far more captivating and good than the film deserves. He channels a Clint Eastwood stranger very well and a little bit of a back story helps make him more mysterious. I had hoped his anger of vengeance would be a little bit more thorough and brutal but he still serves a purpose and his character is well developed for a story lacking truth depth. John Travolta has a very small role and it's an interesting role because he isn't really the villain but rather a victim of circumstance in this case. His death is hilarious in some sense but the performance is quite good. James Ransone is more the villain as Travolta's son and a bit of a nitwit bully. He's not exactly a worthy enemy to Hawke but he works as a vile character. Taissa Farmiga is a young girl trying to come to grips with losing a husband and becomes enamoured with Hawke's stranger. She is also a victim of circumstance ultimately but her character and the connection to Hawke is interesting enough. Toby Huss, Tommy Nohilly and Michael Davis all have decent small roles in the support cast.It makes a lot of sense that Ti West writes and directs this film. He has a background in really low budget horror and there is so much about this film that would be ridiculed and passed over by a lot of people but I liked it for the brainless entertainment it was. It paid an homage to an age old Spaghetti genre and the performances were much better than the film itself. It has little depth but somehow has a backstory worth watching. It is genuinely one of the best bad movies I've seen in a long time if not ever. As a Western fan you can't help but enjoy it. I truly see it as a respectful tribute to the genre. Check it out but keep your expectations proper. It's not Unforgiven, it's a Saturday matinÃ©e popcorn flick for adults. 8/10"
" Dreadful Western Wastes Travolta
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,5,"Hollywood reminds us once again what happens to slimy dastards that kill a man's dog. Initially, this heinous act happened in the 2007 Mark Wahlberg thriller ""Shooter."" Next, it showed up in the Brian Cox movie ""Red"" (2008), while most recently the hero's doggie was killed in the Keanu Reeves' shoot'em up ""John Wick."" Writer & director Ti West's bloodthirsty western saga ""In the Valley of Violence"" appropriates this premise for its slow-burn horse opera graced with fine performances by Ethan Hawke and John Travolta. This far from memorable, low-budget oater boasts impeccable production values. The Cerro Pelon Ranch in Galisteo, New Mexico, where the action transpires looks terrific. Although it is obviously a movie set, the producers have touched it up so it looks like a run-down town instead of a run-down set. Eric Robbins' widescreen cinematography is first-rate. Moreover, he lensed this movie on 35-millimeter film. The pictorial compositions lack interesting angles, suggesting that West helmed the action quickly. The most objectionable thing about this western is the murder of a canine. Mind you, you don't see the poor pooch bite the dust, but discretion makes the violence palatable. The big surprise that occurs 91-minutes into this western is one the last thing you may expect considering the caliber of talent involved. The chief problem with ""In the Valley of Violence"" is the loutish villains who pose little threat to our resolute hero. Travolta seems wasted as a lackluster, one-legged sheriff who cannot make a believer out of his rebellious son. The opening credits sequence is an obvious but admirable homage to Sergio Leone's classic ""A Fistful of Dollars."" Our mind-his-own-business kind of hero, Paul (Ethan Hawke of ""Training Day"") makes the terrible mistake when he rides into the mining community of Denton rather than riding around it on his way of Mexico. He clashes with the son of the local sheriff, Gilly (James Ransome of ""Broken City""), and beats the cowardly braggart in a fair fight. Actually, he smacks Gilly in the face with a bowl and breaks his nose. Marshal Clyde Martin (John Travolta of ""Pulp Fiction"") observes that the fight was fair. Nevertheless, he runs Paul out of town because he suspects that he is an army deserter. West provides some eerie flashback scenes of Paul in an army uniform with a rifle. Paul has made his way through the west with a collie mix named Abbie that is his beloved pet. After he heeds Martin's warning and leaves Denton, Paul is crouched around a campfire talking to his Abbie when the vengeful Gilly and his lamebrained cronies emerge from the darkness. Gilly shoots and stabs Paul's dog to death, and Paul vows that he will liquidate all four of them. Gilly's henchmen push Paul off the side of a mountain. Of course, these villains neglect to check that Paul died during his rocky descent. Predictably, Paul survives the fall, and he rides back into Denton. Once back in Denton, our resourceful sneaks into a hotel and catches Gilly's paunchy henchman Roy (Larry Fessenden of ""Hellbenders"") as he is soaking in a bathtub. Paul reminds him about the events of the previous evening before he slashes his throat. Sheriff Martin finds Roy's body and sends Gilly into hiding with two women. Later, Paul sneaks up behind another henchmen, Harris (Toby Huss of ""Cowboys & Aliens""), that Martin has posted on a store rooftop with a repeating rifle, and kills him. We don't see Paul pull the trigger on Harris. Instead, all we see the reaction that Martin has when he hears the gunfire. Meantime, Paul blows a hole through the chest of the third henchman, Tubby, and kills him with this well-aimed shot. The resolution features a twist since Paul doesn't get a chance to kill Gilly as he had promised; this distinction is left up to someone else. ""In the Valley of Violence"" is Travolta's first western, and we never see him swing astride a horse. He plays an unsavory character with little steel in his blood. Nobody makes a strong entrance in his oater. West doesn't milk the situations for a modicum of suspense. Presumably, he was struggling to get this western made before either the budget elapsed or the stars left to fulfill other assignments. Unless you are a western completest, you should probably avoid this saddle-sore sagebrusher."
" Nobody kills my dog and gets away with it
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,6,"I can sympathize with Ethan Hawke in Valley Of Violence. As far as I'm concerned what he did was perfectly justified when someone tries to kill a pet. The key scenes in this film are Hawke just talking to his dog. It's clear that the animal is more to him than a stray he's taken in. It looks like Hawke's been devoid of human contact for some time while he's on the trail. And it could be he's not in the ordinary sense of the word, a good guy.Neither however is Marshal John Travolta whose town Hawke has stopped in. He considers himself ruler of the place where he brought law and order emphasis on the latter. He's also got a son in James Ransone who is the Qusay Hussen to his Saddam.Hawke who is just there to stop for an overnight rest before moving on is someone that Ransone decides to pick a fight with. After Ransone and his friends kill the dog and leave Hawke for dead, Hawke's taking names and numbers.Elements of a lot of good westerns are present in Valley Of Violence. Two Clint Eastwood classics High Plains Drifter and The Unforgiven, the Burt Lancaster western Valdez Is Coming. You might also include the two John Wayne westerns Hondo and Big Jake since both involve the Duke and a dog. But the Duke was never as attached to his dog as Hawke is here.Western fans should like Valley Of Violence. It sure is something different for John Travolta."
