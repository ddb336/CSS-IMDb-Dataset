" Something sincere, from youth...
",2021-04-09 00:00:00,9,"The film was a pleasant surprise. Filmed superbly, in the style of Rocky I-II. The present is perfectly combined with the past. Something sincere, from youth... Made with high quality, in all aspects."
" Rinse and Repeat
",2021-04-07 00:00:00,3,"This movie is just a complete unoriginal Rio off of Rocky 1, but doesn't even come close to Rocky.The main character is just unlikable. Rocky was an underdog and came off as a kind likable man that seemed to have the world against him.Now the main character in this movie is just an angry black man who really has no redeeming features or personality. In Rocky, we all routed for the u derdog . In this movie I just wanted to see the main character knocked out onto the floor as I couldn't stand another minute of his screen presence. Why Sylvester Stallone took part in this movie just baffles me as it is just an insult to the original Rocky movie."
" Little bit of member berries
",2021-04-02 00:00:00,5,"Fashion in 2015-16 has been bringing back old movies to life. While I thought this was a good movie, I felt there were too many repetitions and the plot wasn't the best or anything realistic to boxing."
" Rocky Balboa is back
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,9,"An exciting new story with Adonis Creed and one of the greatest characters Rocky Balboa.
Intense and amazing filmed fights and emotional scenes with Rocky and Adonis.
Stunning work from Ryan Coogler."
" Must watch !!
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,10,"The Sports/Drama movie continued with the Rocky Saga , is a complete motivation package delivered to you . Creed is not just a great movie but the story telling , & Ryan Coogler's direction is as usual perfect .
Must watch and recommend. üëçüèº Go for it"
" My favourite movie
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,9,I didnt watched the rocky movies but i am definetly gonna watch them now
" Stallone amazing, Michael B Jordan average- worth to watch it
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,8,Stallone as an elderly Rocky Balboa is doing amazing in his iconic role. Michael B Jordan is just exaggerating in his role with an average performance. Overall a movie worth to watch as Rocky Balboa fan.
" Stallone brings us a classic once again
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,10,"I simply loved this movie. The acting is great, especially Sly's. The director also did a great job, and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. The music in this movie is so good and fits the overall story. Nothing but the best from Stallone when it comes to the Rocky franchise!"
" Very good
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,8,"Creed: Nascido para Lutar we come to another Rocky franchise film, but this time, the protagonist is another, Adonis Creed, son of Apollo, who is played by actor Michael B. Jordan. It is not an innovative film, but still, the new character is charismatic, and along with an excellent performance by the actor. Sylvester Stallone is also great in the film and shows one of the best interpretations of his career. Ryan Coogler's direction is very well executed, even in several scenes, the camera is used in his hand, as if it were in independent cinema, but even so, it works perfectly. The photograph is very beautiful and the script is extremely well written and has dialogues that work very well.Film seen on the 13th to the 14th of February 2021."
" Creed
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,8,"I am giving this Film a 8 out of 10. It was pretty good all the other Rocky Film's were Good and Ok. Michael B Jordan that played Creed's Son was a Pretty good Actor. If you watched the first Film's and Seen the Original Creed his Father. He kind of looked like him just a little bite. Oh and Tessa Thompson the Girl he fell for was just beautiful and a Great Singer. And with that Hearing PROBLEM it kind of made her more attractive for some reason. I have no idea why but it did. And with Sylvester Stallone having that problem that he was going to Die. Just made the FILM more hurt full. It was like ok Young Man my WIFE IS DEAD. MY FRIEND IS DEAD, MY LIFE AS A BOXER IS PRETTY MUCH OVER.
My own Son wants NOTHING to do with me. I miss my WIFE. I want to DIE AND BE WITH HER.
That part of that Film just showed how great of an actor Sylvester Stallone is. It was such a great part I had a tear in my Ears."
" Briljant! Bringing Rocky in the 21st century
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,8,"Rocky in the role as Micky is a stroke of genius. Drama, love and sport. Mixed in a very good movie about personal problems and never losing the line of the first Rocky movies."
" Continues the saga very well
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,9,"Phenomenal. Sad. Relieving. All words I could use to describe this amazing movie. Just the fact that Rocky gets unwell makes it even harder for Adonis. The performances by Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone were absolutely brilliant, you could tell when they were sad, angry, and even a mix of both. I also like the fact that instead of just being a side character, Bianca is more than that, we get to see her bond grow with Adonis, and even Rocky. This movie is fantastic, if you haven't watched it, then do."
" [8.1] The younger embodiment
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,8,"An epic film in its own merit, superbly screenplayed and directed by Ryan Coogler, that I enjoyed very much. As one user pointed out, Sylvester Stallone character personification of Rocky Balboa is like a fine wine and he just gets better and better with age, adding wisdom and coolness to his quiver.Michael B. Jordan, the main protagonist showed strength, resolution and necessary fighting spirit. He did well and his inner rage saved him in many fights and rounds, where he sorta had the lower hand.A special note to Tessa Thompson's acting, who IMO played tremendously well and most naturally. In many occasions, her liveliness, joyful smile and happiness mesmerized and enthralled me. Kudos Tessa.The fight scenes were awesome, visceral and very physical. They made you feel you are the one getting punched all over. Superbly choreographed and realized with the help of modern filming and camera works.The musical score was nothing short of amazing and heroic. It paired with the movie's story and plots actions like a fine piece of machinery. Wonderful.All the supporting cast did a fine job artistically and greatly contributed to this pearl.Screenplay/story: 8Realism: 8Entertainment: 8.5Acting: 8.5Filming/cinematography: 8.5Special effects: 8.5Music/score: 9Depth: 8Logic: 7Development: 7.5Suspense/thrill: 8Ending: 8The first movie in the new franchise and the finest one."
" Creed review
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,9,I like the movie at all but the story is at the most points too predictable.
" Blew me away... a modern classic
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,8,"When I saw this I was so looking forward to it, and when I finally saw it I was absolutely blown away. MBJ was excellent, and Sly was just Sly. The music by Tessa was hauntingly good, and the action was friggin superb. Sly is a global treasure and we should be grateful for his contribution to modern film because he truly has added something to most of our lives. He came from nothing and just kept on hammering away and demanded to be trusted and to be taken seriously and this film encapsulates his spirit to a tee. For me Creed should have cleaned up at the Oscars because it gave the one single thing that we all want from a movie and that is entertainment (and the entertainment here is of the highest calibre). Well done to the production staff and well done to Sly and MJB. A modern classic and an motivator to pick you up when you feel down."
" What was once a flawless movie saga has just sadly been tainted with the release of this shameless ""film"".
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,4,"""Creed"" (2015), I don't normally say this about bad movies often, but this ""film"" is the literal definition of corporate. When you can tell that a movie or TV show is corporate, then something is very wrong. ""Creed"" is the result of greed. It's nothing but a waste of time and a worthless cash-grab! Seriously, why does this ""movie"" and it's sequel exist? No really, why was it made? Nobody asked to see Adonis Creed's story, I certainly didn't! This ""film"" has a lazy and predictable storyline, average to abysmal acting, and an overall dull soundtrack. The story is, Adonis Creed, played by Michael B. Jordan, wants to become a boxer and enlists Rocky to be his trainer, who eventually agrees. Hmmm, that sounds familiar, doesn't it? Yep, it's a blatant rip-off of ""Rocky V"" (1990), where Rocky also trains a sprouting boxer. We've seen that already, and we don't need to see it again! That's one of the biggest issues with modern movies and TV shows, 9 out of 10 of them are either remakes, reboots or recycled plot lines. To be fair, this ""film"" has the advantage of not being either a remake or reboot, it's just a lazy continuation that no one asked for. The concept is poorly conceived, the story is a dull pile of boredom and it was just a cliched mess! Another jarring element of this ""movie"", is that Rocky develops cancer. Yeah, didn't see that coming! That is so disrespectful to his character. Now, when you do a film trilogy or saga, it is imperative to have ups and downs. But, it's important to end on an emotional, yet happy note. ""Rocky Balboa"" (2006) did exactly that, Rocky found a brand new outlook on life and learned to cope with and enjoy what he had. But then, ""Creed"" had to slap his character in the face with a brand new state of misery. That just results in the story, or lack thereof, amounting to nothing but pure concentrated unpleasantness. I don't know how they managed to convince Sylvester Stallone to be a part of it! Now, I do understand that this ""film"" was going for the passing of the torch story, so to speak. However, you have to know what you're doing and make the existence of the ""movie"" necessary. Otherwise, it's entirely pointless! As for the acting, it's overall just as bad as the storyline is. However, the only ones who appear to be showing any effort with their acting are Sylvester Stallone, Michael B. Jordan and Phylicia Rashad. Those three are the only ones who appear to be putting forth some sort of performance. Of course, the standout character here is Rocky, once again played by Sylvester Stallone. That goes without saying! Although, to tell you the truth, that's the primary reason I gave in to watching this cinematic diarrhea in the first place, because Rocky was in it. The rest of the acting is just standard to abysmal. Finally, the soundtrack, composed by Ludwig G√∂ransson is nothing short of dull, yet predictable. The film score does have some interesting parts, but overall, it's just appalling, especially the hip-hop and rap! If only Bill Conti composed the soundtrack for this ""movie"", it might have been more on the right track. Bill Conti composed the music for the first six films in the ""Rocky"" saga. He is one of my top 10 all-time favorite movie score composers, but I highly doubt that a score of his caliber would be enough to save this ""film"". Now, let's get to the only two good elements in this pile of filth. Yes, there are some positives in this ""movie"". The only good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great and give this ""movie"" a decent atmosphere. You can't go wrong with Philadelphia, Los Angeles, or any towns in England! All of the special effects are very well-done, which is no surprise, being a film made in 2015. However, as I've mentioned before on multiple occasions, great sets/locations and special effects are no excuses for poor screenwriting and acting. ""Creed"" is yet just another abomination of modern day cinema. This franchise has suffered the same fate as the ""Indiana Jones"" and the ""Men in Black"" trilogies, you have a perfect set of movies, followed by unnecessary cash-grabs that amount to nothing. The only resemblance of praise I can give to ""Creed"", is that we get to see Rocky again. I'm struggling to give it 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Do I really have to tell you to stay away from ""Creed"" and it's unnecessary inevitable sequels? Just watch the real ""Rocky"" films instead, because ""Creed"" simply taints the ""Rocky"" series with it's completely worthless existence! This ""movie"" is nothing but a middle finger to the ""Rocky"" franchise."
" Better than the original Rocky?
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,9,"Creed is written and directed by Ryan Coogler. This film follows Adonis Johnson, son of the late Apollo Creed, as he's trained by the former Heavyweight Champion of the World Rocky Balboa.
The cast is unbelievable, with Michael B. Jordan as the lead in his second collaboration with Coogler. Sylvester Stallone reprising his most iconic role for which he got an Oscar nomination. Tessa Thompson as the love interest and Phylicia Rashad as Adonis' mom are both excellent too. The music by Ludwig G√∂ransson is inspiring, the cinematography makes the city of Philadelphia where the story mostly takes place a character inside the film, and Ryan Coogler's approach to the fighting sequences is top-notch. The best praise that I can give this film is that it respects the Rocky legacy while not having to rely on it."
" Michael B. Jordan rocks!
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,8,"Creed is a special type of film in regards to how it manages to bring back the Rocky franchise with a new protagonist and main characters but also keep the feel of the original, and of course keep Sylvester Stallone in a big supporting role.The acting is really great, Michael B. Jordan is a worthy lead and Tessa Thompson is a great actress, really good casting her as Adonis' girlfriend. Sylvester Stallone is fantastic as ever and it was nice to see Phylicia Rashad playing Adonis' mother and Apollo's former wife. It might have been nice to see a better opponent than boxer ""Pretty"" Ricky played by real life boxer Tony Bellew. But he's a suitable challenge for Adnois.The music is very uplifting and suitable and the cinematography fast paced and exciting making it a good watch.8/10: Brings Rocky back with a bang"
" A bit humdrum and dull
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,4,"Disclaimer...ok, I didn't watch all of it. About an hour. I'd read reviews and thought it would be a really good film.There's some bad script writing. The bit about the job promotion at the beginning is really cliched as the audience know that he's not going to take it and it's ham-fistedly dealt with by the mother explicitly mentioning the job promotion. It's just a bit amateur.It's a boxer's film, I suppose. If you don't like boxing, there's not much appeal."
" Boring and stupid
",2020-12-10 00:00:00,3,"Remember Rocky, the 1976 masterpiece based on good story, good music, and very likeable characters? This movie had none of that.
The movie stars Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Creed, son of Apollo Creed. This whole project was out of Stallones hands, so i cant blame him, but what the hell? Adonis is the most immature, whiny brat I've seen in a while. He's totally unlikeable, he finds out Rocky had cancer so he cusses him out and insults him. His girlfriend isn't any better, being 100% useless to the plot and almost breaking up with Adonis because he didn't tell her he was the son of Apollo. They even try to make her interesting by making her have an ear problem that will eventually result in her being deaf. This story also insults Apollo, having him cheating on his wife in order to have Adonis. It was missing all the depth and all the heart of 1976's Rocky. The only reason i dont rate it a ""1"" is because Stallone is good in it and reprises his role as Rocky very expertly."
" Beautiful
",2020-11-30 00:00:00,10,"What a beautiful gift for rocky fans. Awesome. Yes, ALL the elements we know are there, and yet its exciting, beautiful, full of emoticon, a lot of nice references, and the most beautiful end."
" TIME TAKES EVERYBODY OUT, TIMES UNDEFEATED
",2020-11-18 00:00:00,9,"Moving on from the Rocky series the focal point is Adonis Johnson (Michael B Jordan) the son of Apollo Creed to a different mother. His passion is fighting like his father and left home in Los Angeles and his step mother to train under Rocky in Philadelphia much like the events in Rocky V except Adonis is loyal to Rocky and meets Bianca (Tessa Thompson). He gets a big fight based on his fathers name against champ Ricky Conlan (Tony Bellew) who needs 1 big fight before pending jail time but Adonis is forced to use his fathers name. The fight was spectacular and showed there was plenty of mileage in the Rocky franchise still. It was really cool they got Tony Bellew to play a boxer since hes one of Britains top boxers at the time. Michael B Jordan was brilliant as Adonis as was Stallone still as the old Rocky Balboa even after losing Apollo, Adrian and Paulie he still has the strength to help Adonis and Bianca"
" 10/10 cringe points
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,5,Had to look away many times to bear the cringe. My favorite was the shadowboxing-motorcycle-dramatic-music-scene. üôà
" Amazing movie
",2020-10-15 00:00:00,10,Definitely the best boxing movie I have ever seen. I love Creed from beginning to end.
" Well narrated paradoxic of illegitimated son
",2020-10-14 00:00:00,6,"Adonis Johnson wants to be a box like his father, Apollo Creed despite Apollo died before he was born. In the beginning he insist to use Adonis Johnson as boxer's name when a rival proposed a fight in condition of using Adonis Creed. Because he never met him and he thinks he is a mistake so he is kind of hate his father. With girlfriends persuasion he decided to take the propose. But then he also afraid that he might discredit the reputation of Creed built by his father.
The transition from Rocky movie series to Creed movie is a bit abrupt. Paulie was a good friend and a relative of Rocky and the character became very important in later Rocky movies, especially after Adriana died. However the death of Paulie was described briefly.
Overall, I think it is a good drama. But I like Rocky movies series better."
" Creed is a good example of how to make a mix of remake, reboot and continuation without offending the intelligence or indulging the fans' indulgence
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,8,"Creed is Rocky's seventh film and a spin-off from the Rocky film series. During its six films, the Rocky Balboa franchise has inspired thousands of people with its message of overcoming, and by showing that anyone is capable of winning in life, if they believe in their potential. The franchise had been very well completed with Rocky Balboa (2006), who tied elements since the first film in the saga, and dealt with the boxer's aging issue as new generations appeared. Therefore, the proposal for a kind of sequence, or spin-off with the son of Apollo Creed, could sound out of place. Fortunately, this is a good example of how to make a mix of remake, reboot and continuation without offending the intelligence or indulging the fans' indulgence. In his re-reading of the 1976 film, screenwriter and director Ryan Coogler seems to be more concerned with giving new meaning to old images.When we thought that the fighter's saga was over, behold young director Ryan Coogler (who emerged in the great ""Fruitvale Station: The Last Stop"", 2013) sought out Stallone with the idea of giving the saga a new lease of life, this time putting Rocky as the tutor of the son of Apollo Creed, greatest opponent and friend of the Italian Stallion. Adonis (Michael B. Jordan) spent the first years of his life in orphanages - the birth mother died early. Until he is found by Mary-Anne (Phylicia Rashad), Apollo's widow, who decides to adopt the boy. Cut to Adonis already grown up. He has a good job and lives in the adoptive mother's mansion and, without her knowing it, participates in clandestine boxing matches. He tries to integrate the gym where his father used to train, but they stop him. He lives in the shadow of Apollo. He decides to move to Philadelphia, where he looks for Rocky to train him. At first the veteran, who continues his lonely life playing at Adrian's restaurant, doesn't accept. However, each finds inspiration in the other to move on.""Creed"" goes hand in hand with ""Rocky "". There is the inexperienced boxer with the chance to face the world champion, who needs to improve his image before the public. Love interest at first hesitant. The training. The fight. But just like in the Disney movie, there is more than just nostalgia. New characters are introduced for the current generation. Michael B. Jordan's Adonis is not Rocky. Their difficulties are different. Rocky represented an entire working class. Adonis has several internal conflicts. No less important. Coogler does not try to give Adonis a responsibility similar to Rocky's. The social commentary on Creed is shyer, less resonant, but it is still there: at a time when boxing makes headlines more for Floyd Mayweather's ostentatious style outside the ring, it ends up being an interesting starting point than Adonis's bow it involves renouncing wealth in order to, above honoring his father's name, earn street cred with black people from Philadelphia and prove that he is not just the Hollywood boy.The director sees the paradox of classic sequences with maturity: it is necessary to provide again the elements that captivated the audience, while offering innovations, so as not to convey the impression of a simple copy - in which case the original film, strengthened in memory, always wins. And it does well in both ways. The script, also by Coogler in partnership with Aaron Covington, respects the Rocky tradition, paying homage to Stallone's previous work, but rejuvenates the franchise to the current audience. Rocky must deal with another adversary, the most difficult of his life, while Adonis tries to overcome the weight of being the son of a great fighter, and prove to himself that he is capable of creating a new legacy with the name Creed. It rescues the famous elements, such as the staircase, the theme songs and the accelerated montages during training. But the good news is that none of these key pieces appear as expected: the director manages to subvert the symbols of the franchise, interfering with the duration of the scenes and their use throughout the narrative. Likewise, there are dozens of references to all previous films, with the exception of the execrated Rocky V (1990), which, however, would have evident connections with the 2015 plot, about a new Rocky pupil. The script introduces the quotes in a discreet way (the turtles, the restaurant, the training with the chickens, etc.), seeking to please fans of the franchise without making it impossible for anyone who has never seen any film in the series.
Creed boldly studies Rocky's heart, rescuing a more innocent essence that allowed the 1976 classic to even reach an Oscar for Best Picture. Sylvester Stallone, in that case, did not want to do a project about boxing itself, in which the purpose was fighting, but a story about failure, about impossible dreams, the opportunities that come up to never return and, in the end, American dreams. Ryan Coogler, while responsible for the direction and co-writer of his feature film, seeks to express his own feelings about the franchise, with the peaks of energy, the struggles, being consequences of competent character studies. The affection that the script, for example, has for Stallone is touching, recovering the great artist that Sly has always been. Here, the opponent of Adonis, therefore, matters little, as it did not matter who Apollo was, in the original, but a metaphor for America and that alone.The building of existing relationships in Creed is mainly based on the relationship between trainer and student. There is a sweetness in the presence of these characters and the relationship flourishes gradually, thanks to the talent of both, Stallone certainly delivers the best performance of his career so far, walking in a fine and charming line of resignation, with the arrival of old age, and the desire and the hope of seeing each other again in the game, even if that happens in the figure of his disciple.
The fight scenes, on the other hand, with long-lasting sequences, show a competent camera domain, yearning for their own identity, but, above all, Coogler's intention to control the action and embark the viewer on the protagonist's journey. Coogler and director of photography Maryse Alberti performed exquisite work in moving cameras, knowing how to create the right atmosphere for each scene, be it fighting or dialogue. Both use and abuse the tools of ultra-realism, with sweat, blood splashing and bodies falling brutally to the floor. The sound effects make the clash visceral, but the use of slow motion and inclined planes is so exaggerated that it borders on preciousness. They film objects in detail plans with obsession, from the city's traditional philly steak sandwich to the images of the ice bag and gel at the edge of the ring. This attempt to make everything more urgent and to register things ""for real"" extends to the sequential plans, several throughout the film. The most successful are Adonis' first two fights. In the first, the camera accompanies you in sequence from entering the ring to the knockout. In the second, there are two robberies staged in a single plane. The camera surrounds the fighters, comes and goes in close-ups for dramatic effect, and takes advantage when it is behind the actors' backs to catch the blows - so we can't see if the glove passes away from the face. The trick works, and in this scene Coogler has a good sense of suspense construction, like when the camera, after surrounding the actors, returns to Adonis' face to show the eyebrow he just opened. The edition of the Brazilian Claudia Castello and the American Michael P. Shawver give the right rhythm to each scene, sometimes more contemplative, emphasizing the drama, sometimes more energetic and explosive, emphasizing the action, the struggles. Also noteworthy is the soundtrack by Swede Ludwig Goransson, who creates a contemporary work in keeping with the reality of the ghetto, full of hip hop beats, and which does not give up parts of Bill Conti's immortalized soundtrack.This search for authenticity in the record, which takes two thirds of Creed, is what allows the film to play itself in the fan service in the end. Hence the highlight goes to the new version of the staircase scene, in which Adonis - wearing the same gray tracksuit as Rocky, the same hat, the same gesture, even in the arms up - is accompanied by the blacks of the ghetto in the pike until the end from street. It is clear that Creed, in addition to building an imaginary of the city for himself, seeks to mark out these easter eggs in a new context, to validate them, and not simply to please the nostalgic.Creed is moving without being mushy, electrifying without being bold and modern without forgetting everything that has been done before. It is a round film, made with care and a great desire to entertain and please with the basics, but without surrendering to the obvious. The film manages to restore what the struggle means within the franchise, even in the role of the character Bianca (Tessa Thompson), Donnie's supporting and love interest. The great Tessa Thompson, however, is underutilized, and the character's text is not the most organic, bordering on an artificial display of what her problems are. But Creed honors Apollo's legacy in such a passionate way that the scene of the boy imitating the blows struck in one of the battles between his father and, now, his trainer is a very solid example of what Creed wants to be. A work not only about being reborn as a name, but also about continuing a journey that spans generations. Survival ceased to be that raw of yore, however, the love for the love of sport and what it meant to your past. The punches that no longer need to be thrown, but must be thrown, confirm where a franchise is in the world that has always magnified us."
" Great tribute to Rocky franchise, but just another boxing film.
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,5,"I was never a fan of Rocky franchise or any boxing film in general, but this film was one of the better ones for sure. Most of the film is references to the previous Rocky films, which is great. On the other hand it really lacks the original music from previous Rocky films. The story is generic - a kid who wants to become a boxing champion finds a legendary boxer and gets him to be his trainer and with tons of training gets to the top. We seen it million of times, but what makes it better than most others is that it's a sequel and acknowledges the previous Rocky films. It's also quite well executed, the fighting scenes are prety good."
" Incredible continuation
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,9,"Despite a very similar plot to the original Rocky, Creed is an incredible continuation that finds new life in the Rocky franchise with an emotional and thrilling film. Michael B. Jordan gives an incredible performance and has fantastic chemistry with Tessa Thompson, who is also incredible and Sylvester Stallone, who is perfect and gives an all time great performance. Ryan Googler's direction is amazing with intense and visceral fights. It's extremely well paced and the music by Ludwig G√∂ransson is amazing."
" Let's get ready to Rumble!!!
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,8,This is really a good one from Rocky franchise.This movie has great potential and acting level.Stolyn is still champ...
" Incredible! Challenges Rocky II for the best installment since the first (NO SPOILERS)
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,10,"So good it's painful. Jordan is exceptional - and was given an outstanding screenplay to showcase his talent. This is NOT a re-hash of Rocky with Creed's son as an excuse. This is a remarkable return to the grit, passion, and HEART of the original movie.The updated soundtrack is strikingly emotional and appropriate. The fight scenes are easily the best of the franchise. Remember that in it's time - Rocky did things nobody had done with a camera. Rather than reproduce what was revolutionary in the 70s, Creed paves it's own path. You are IN the ring, you are being hit. It's so good it's frightening and uncomfortable. And it's magnificent.Nothing about the movie is forced. With the story being told, there were SO many opportunities to blow it - to fall into cliche, stereotype, or fantasy. Instead what you get is original, realistic, and raw. The fact that this movie can accomplish ""raw"" is a wonderful surprise.And yes, as you've heard, Stallone is at the top of his game. You are watching Rocky. Covington, Coogler and Stallone brought back the man we all wanted to be.For those who have never seen Rocky, who never knew the magic of that film, they will find it here. I didn't know who this director Coogler was, but I know now. Wow. Just wow."
" Amazing, amazing and amazing
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,10,"A very well made movie with great actors and a great team in general. Stallone delivers, Michael B Jordan delivers, Tessa delivers, I mean what's not to like about this movie? This movie can literally motivate you enough to run through a brick wall, that's how motivating and inspiring it is."
" Beautifully Great,amazing and brilliant!Masterpiece!
",2020-06-26 00:00:00,10,"It's like going in old town after long time that nostalgia points were emotionally spectacular,the story was packed with awesome continuation of legacy of Rocky and amazingly connected to Creed's.the relations were beautifully developed of the trainer and fighter and loved one's,the little little life lessons from Rocky is literally satisfying and amazing,its the better enhanced version of original 2 movies it was emotional,nostalgic,iconic and amazing,the ending fight was nail-biting and great ended with respect and the closing shot of steps it was literally sweetest and greatest moment,the whole movie is brilliantly shot it was gorgeous and the fight scenes were awesome,its a great movie A Masterpiece!"
" Rocky comes back, as a trainer
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,8,"Creed is a sports drama movie directed by Ryan Coogler and stars Sylvester Stallone, Michael B. Jordan, Tessa Thompson, Phylicia Rashad and Anthony Bellew in the leads.This is the seventh movie in the Rocky Franchise.This movie is probably one of the best Rocky movies in the recent times. Rocky is back again as a trainer. This movie again focuses on more emotion just like the previous movie. The plot is predictable but good. Acting is good. Screenplay gets slow but still not disappoint you much.This movie might give birth to a new franchise in the name of Creed as Creed II is already released and planning of Creed III is underway.A nice emotional movie with one of the best performance by Stallone. A must watch."
" Awesome

" wasn't a fan of boxing til rocky
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,10,"I always get chills whenever i watch the rocky franchise even though i'm not into boxing; i've really enjoyed watching each film.creed wasn't a disappointment to this franchise. it's such a beautiful movie with a new and modern style but still has the heart and soul of the previous rocky movies.what i really like about this film is that, just like what they said in the film, they didn't let rocky cast a shadow on the young creed. he made a name for himself and let rocky guide him and craft him into who he became.love the twist. always think they'd win the last fights. and THIS is what makes this franchise SO SO special. something other film series just don't understand.acting, cinematography, production, and storytelling was amazing and i'm actually surprised. SYLVESTER STALLONE stays iconic forever and always."
" One of the best movie since the last 30 years
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,10,"I've just seen this movie and I can say that is one of the best movie ever made. It is a great movie because it tales about a great story which is much more human than just of boxing. People hurting this movie like stupid shooter movie just to get easy emotional drug. As far as me, the best of Balboa franchise probably equally to the first one of the whole series."
" Great Sequel to Rocky
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,8,"Michael B. Jordan crushes this one. It's great to see the Rocky legacy live on and Creed still be remembered.How would've thought that this string of movies would come after the original Rocky.The filmmaking in this one is modern and up to date and gives a renewed spirit to Rocky and the young Creed himself.Now, new generations can appreciate the series of Rocky through Creed.Great work on this long-awaited film cast and crew."
" Crushed It.
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,8,"Michael B. Jordan crushed it on this long-awaited film.In a sequel to the Rocky series, its great to see the legacy live on. How amazing is it that they made this string of movies with Rocky and now Creed.Great work by the cast and crew and bringing a more modern feel to Rocky and this boxing movie.Live on Creed!"

" A surprisingly impressive reboot
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,7,"Considering I never particularly liked the original Rocky movies, I was not expecting much from this latest offering. It sounded like a truly terrible idea, especially as 2006's Rocky Balboa had provided a very satisfactory ending to the series. I chose to watch it more out of morbid curiosity than anything else and I was fully expecting to hate it. As it happens, it's actually pretty impressive. The production is excellent, the acting is superior to the originals and the fight scenes are visually spectacular and well-choreographed. The shot of Creed hitting the deck in slow-motion in the final fight is an amazing piece of cinematography. Ryan Coogler does a great job with the writing and it makes you wonder how much better the original sequels could have been had Stallone allowed someone else to take over the screenplay.Stallone gives probably his best performance across all the Rocky films (and maybe his career), thriving in his role as a lonely bereaved restaurant manager. His gentle handling of the cancer storyline was exceptional, culminating in an incredibly moving final scene where he scales the famous Philadelphia steps at walking pace.I was very sceptical of Tony Bellew being offered a role in this film, but he gives a surprisingly strong performance. Admittedly, he is only really playing himself and he's used to the cameras, but It's still an achievement to translate it to the big screen so well. I was less impressed by Michael B. Jordan however, who I felt was wooden and monotonous throughout.In fact, the whole Adonis Creed character was a bit of a let-down. A kid who spent his early days in foster care, has never known his parents and who possesses the physical and psychological traits of Apollo Creed has the potential to be a mesmerising lead character. The development of Adonis could and should have been the essence of this movie. We could have seen a fiercely emotional tortured soul, finding meaning and purpose in sport. Instead, he was nothing more than a forgettable walking clich√©. His relationship with Bianca was also very drab and it wasn't helped by Tessa Thompson's tepid performance.I was still very impressed with Creed and would recommend it. It's just a shame more work wasn't put into creating a stronger lead character."
" Outstanding Comeback
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,9,"By far the best movie in the Rocky series. The chemistry between Rocky, Adonis, and his girlfriend is magic. Very well written script. Love the soundtrack too!"
" Creed is Rocky
",2020-03-22 00:00:00,8,"Everything about this movie represents what a Rocky sequel/spin-off should be, entertaining, engaging, and emotional. It's a great addition to the Rocky franchise, that would have been better had Creed actually won. It would have made more sense too, since Adonis Creed vs Ricky Conlan 2 was never on the table. Also with him winning, it could have distanced him from his mentor showing that the Creed's are boxers than the Balboa's."
" A great continuation of the story
",2020-03-14 00:00:00,9,"Creed is a spin-off of the Rocky franchise but this time focuses on Adonis Creed, Apollo Creed's son. He wants to follow in his father's footsteps and is trained by the Rocky Balboa himself. This movie really goes into the relationship between Creed and Rocky and how they both support each other when they mostly need it. Rocky was a broken man and needed someone like Adonis Creed in his life. You can feel the emotions and the sadness in him in this movie.
Michael B. Jordan is phenomenal as Adonis Creed. He is perfect when doing the boxing scenes and is even better when his character is being developed throughout the movie. And Sylvester Stallone...... he absolutely knocks it out of the park in what may have been his best performance in his career as an actor. Everything he has done in the movie made me feel for him. I felt for both Rocky and Creed. This was like a father and son relationship. With Rocky who doesn't have a son and Adonis someone who doesn't have a dad. It's all incredible to watch and it was worth a good movie like this. 9/10 Loved it."
" Unnecessary Cash Grab
",2020-03-10 00:00:00,5,"I hate unneeded sequels. Creed comes off as a cash grab riding on the success of the Rocky series.The original Rocky formula is there, but it doesn't come off as believable. Why would a retired boxer now try to train some random guy who walks into his restaurant? Is Rocky going to do this for everyone that guilt trips him? A good boxer does not equate into a good coach. Not to mention that just because someone's dad is a good boxer doesn't mean that their offspring will be as well.Even if we fix the suspension of belief, the movie moves too slow to be enjoyable. Creed has lots of drama interspersed between training montages and fight scenes. The time it takes to get to action is long and full of awkward dialogue. Once we get to the fights, they're short and end too fast. Lots more to be desired from a boxing movie.Do love the actors in this movie though. Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone do what they can with a cash-grab movie.2.5/5. I tried to love this but I can't. The movie is too much of a drag for me to enjoy."
" The Rocky saga continues
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,7,"The son of Apollo Creed, Adonis Johnson (very well played by Micheal B.Johnson) talks Rocky Balboa into training him as a professional boxer, eventually fighting for the World Light Heavyweight title in England (against real life boxer Tony Bellow).
Unlike John Rambo Rocky has had to hang up his gloves, in some ways this is a retread of the original movie. But that doesn't matter, it's a well made, engaging film. Sure, the fight scenes, although well filmed, are exaggerated, but that is in keeping with the previous movies. And at times it did feel a little too long.
Although this film is called Creed it is as much a Rocky movie, he's a fighter in more ways than one, I found that aspect quite touching. Sly Stallone, incredible actor, full respect to you.
Seconds out for the sequel.."
" creed
",2020-01-28 00:00:00,8,"I know that this film follows the same tropes of other boxing films and it basiacly copied plot of first rocky but for me this is still great film and the best one since original rocky,stallone was great in this film and he give one of his best performances in lifetime,michael b jordan was really intersting as a lead character and his chemistry with tessa was also very good made and acomplished ,final boxing match was also very good potrayed and it felt like it was made with a lot of care for this franchise and its fans,like i said to some people this film will be to similiar to first rocky but since that film is my favourite of franchise i didnt minded to see it again with some new faces"
" Good but recyclecd plot
",2020-01-08 00:00:00,7,"Bottom Line up Front: This is a good coming of age story and a story which shows that anyone can achieve greatness provided they take responsibility for themselves. Additionally, they have have to work at it and not blame others for their failures. If you liked the Rocky movies, you are likely to enjoy this one.While this film does use a similar plot to the original Rocky, there are some differences but the story is basically the same. The main difference deals with the reasons the two different fighters chose to fight. In Rocky, Balboa fights because he really can't do anything else. In this film, Adonis is driven to fight. While he was not born with a ""silver spoon"" he did have a predominately sheltered and good up bringing and did get a good education. He dose not need to box to earn a good living. He seems to be driven by something inside. Not sure what message this sends to people but to me, it may be the wrong message. I don't see the need to fight when you don't have to.Anyway, the good parts of this film clearly show that everyone, young and old needs to be responsible for themselves. Fight the fights that need to be fought (physical, mental and medical alike). Avoid the ones that you don't need to engage. Both Adonis and Rocky come face to face with some of these issues.I also did like the some of the similarities this film had with original Rocky. Especially with Rocky coming full circle in training Adonis. That was important to show."
" Nothing feels rushed
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,7,I love how Coogler takes it's time with the movie. Nothing feels rushed. He let's us get to know the characters so that the climactic showdown can feel satisfying.
" The Rocky drama is back!!
",2019-12-21 00:00:00,9,"Adonis Johnson, the illegitimate son of former heavyweight champion Apollo Creed, tries to make it as a boxer and after several knockbacks seeks mentorship from Rocky Balboa, his father's old friend and rival.
Michael B Jordan is fantastic and has great chemistry with Tessa Thompson (Bianca) Who he falls for and with Sylvester Stallone (Rocky) who he lovingly calls 'Unc'.
When the boxing world learns that the legendary Apollo Creed had a son and even more so is being taught to fight by Rocky the world eats it up. Adonis is challenged by the undefeated, hot headed champion and after speaking to a reluctant Rocky, Adonis accepts. Rocky and Adonis prepare for the almost impossible fight whilst also fighting another almost impossible fight they were not expecting. Again like all Rocky films the emotions are high and the action is exciting.
HOW SYLVESTER STALLONE DID NOT WIN BEST SUPPORTING OSCAR IN 2015 IS UNBELIEVABLE?????"
" You can not create the same magic twice
",2019-12-07 00:00:00,5,"There is nothing wrong with Creed in terms of direction and acting. The issue I have, is that it's basically the original Rocky and the same magic can not happen twice. It has the same formula of the original film, with Stallone taking on the role of Micky, while Jordan takes on the role of Rocky. With that said, the film is executed fairly well, with a lot of energy. Much of the credit has to go to Ryan Coogler, Sylvester Stallone and the young star of the film, Michael B. Jordan. But at the end of the day, Creed is too predictable and familiar and outside of Jordan's fine performance and arguably Stallone's best work of his career, there is not much here to recommend."
" Creed
",2019-11-24 00:00:00,10,"Rocky has become a pop-culture reference, a true movie classic and an inspiration among people around the world. It is a story that revolves around a small-time boxer who achieves greatness within the rare chance of becoming a heavy-weight champion. In 1977, 'Rocky' won 3 Oscars out of its 10 nominations in various categories including best screenplay and best leading actor. This was a success that launched a series of sequels that have been positively received by critics and the public, while some failed to achieve the same success to its predecessor. It's been 9 years since we last saw Sylvester Stallone in his iconic role as Rocky Balboa in ' Rocky Balboa' , and suddenly
a young director Ryan Coogler ( Fruitvale Station ) comes around and pitched an idea that would bring back Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa along with introducing a new rising star Michael B. Jordan as the protagonist: Adonis Creed, the son of the great Apollo Creed who was played by Carl Weathers in the previous Rocky films. Only this time around, we see Rocky taking up the mantle as a trainer and mentor to Adonis Creed.
The film starts with a flashback where we see Adonis Creed as a child in juvenile detention until he gets a visit from a woman who turns out to be his father's wife. The woman takes him in, and we cut to present day whereAdonis has grown up in wealth in L.A. and he has everything. Except he doesn't. He does small time underground boxing without his stepmother knowing, but he feels the urge to box professionally like his father did. Adonis Creed decides to quit his job and move to Philadelphia and build up his boxing career. This is where he searches for Rocky Balboa to coach him. This comes as a surprise since Rocky didn't know that Apollo Creed had a son with another woman. We see that Rocky Balboa doesn't want to train Adonis since he still feels guilt over Apollo Creed's death that happened in the ring in 'Rocky IV' (1985). And the story builds up from here where we see an emotional and inspirational journey that takes these two characters on a deep discovery about each other, and at the same time we meet various universal themes such as: father-and-son / parent-to-children relationship, finding the right path, success in life, etc.
Director Ryan Coogler's vision and his writing in this film is raw and realistic. And with the combination of outstanding performances from Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone, you get a very compelling and riveting story that has so many layers to it. With an Oscar nomination this is one of Sylvester Stallone's best performances in his acting career. The score composed by Ludwig G√∂ransson pays a great homage to Bill Conti's iconic work on the Rocky films. This is a riveting, compelling and emotionally driven film that is true to what the first ' Rocky' stood for and with the inclusion of a new and young blood to the saga that plants the seeds for a new franchise that resonates well towards a younger audience in present youth culture, 'Creed' is a great film that balances elements from the first Rocky film while expressing universal themes such as family and the relationship between a father and son in a beautiful way."

" make something of yourself
",2019-11-16 00:00:00,9,"The ""Rocky"" franchise is one of the most famous in cinema history. Now, we have the protagonist from the previous movies handing the baton to the new generation (in this case, the son of his former rival). As with the original, the basic gist of the movie is making something of oneself. And ""Creed"" does a great job laying that out. It's one that you gotta see. Sylvester Stallone, Michael B. Jordan and Tessa Thompson all put on fine performances.Long live the city of brotherly love!"
" Creed is perfect. This moment is perfect. I hope Creed II is anywhere near as intoxicating.
",2019-11-09 00:00:00,9,"After the last Rocky film was already pretty strong this is another example of sequels not necessarily being pointless nostalgia but in best case adding new layers to a franchise. Sure, we have the usual ingredients of boxer films here as well, that's a tad predictable. But it's all so well done and performed, especially by Stallone, that you're glad you're along for the ride. The music is another great feature, both referencing the classic Rocky scores and going new ways. A very satisfying and enthralling new installment."
" Seventh Round Knockout
",2019-11-01 00:00:00,9,"Creed is a sure-fire hit that's impossible to hate because of the excellent direction from Coogler, and some of the best boxing sequences I've ever seen in my life and very realistic writing and dialogue. The music is another great feature, both referencing the classic Rocky scores and going new ways. A very satisfying and enthralling new installment."
" I love it but
",2019-10-15 00:00:00,7,It was a good movie with all action but there was too much unnecessary part
" An Honest Review
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,10,"I don't want to give this a bad score, because it is a very solid film. And all the acting is very good. I just have an issue with how the title character was writtenMichael B. Jordan's Adonis came off as a little too sincere without the surface flash of Carl Weathers or the working man grit of Sly's Rocky. He was a little too motivated to fight which set him apart from Rocky and not cocky enough in the fight to be close to Apollo, which left him a little too milk-toast and middle of the road for a character in a leading role.And that issue I blame on the writing and not Jordan's performance (who did a decent enough job playing the flat middle-of-the road boxer).Had he gone a little more to the Apollo side and been flash and brass on the surface with depth beneath, it would have been better, or had he gone more Stallone and done the working class grit and determination thing it would have worked a little better, or a combination of the two.. or even just been more of an prig. Something, anything to get his character a little unbalanced in any direction and it would have been a great film.But I can understand where it was hard trying to balance the new Creed between two stellar past performances without making him feel like a clone of either Stallone or Weathers.And Jordan did sell the physicality.Plus, Rocky himself had a new struggle to face down and take the hits from even without being in the ring, which was of course great.Not to mention, that you got to see Jordan's Creed struggle and fight and take one something a little out of his pay grade with grit and determination and raw humanity. You got to see the new Creed not back down, and that was just as inspiring as any other Rocky movie.It was a great movie that was competently acted by all involved, and it had the same style of script and the same core message that you would expect from a Rocky film.It was an excellent movie and an excellent movie in an era that has a shortage of great films. Praise should be given all around.I just hope that in Creed II, we get to see Jordan have a little more depth to his character, a few more flaws, something to make him more memorable and stand out against Stallone and Weathers. He's a good enough actor to do it, he just doesn't have a script that gives him the little something that makes him as memorable as Rocky and Apollo."
" Two-fisted entertainment.
",2019-09-08 00:00:00,8,"Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) has retired from boxing but his story continues in Creed, as the one-time heavyweight champ is talked into becoming a trainer by Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan), Apollo Creed's illegitimate son. Bounced around care institutions as a child, learning to use his fists in the process, Adonis has won a series of boxing matches in Mexico, but wants to make a name for himself in the professional boxing circuit. To do so, he enlists the help of the Italian Stallion, who teaches the young man to not only improve his technique in the ring, but also to come to terms with his legacy.Creed sees the Rocky franchise returning to its roots, with the focus on character development and drama, whilst adding a renewed sense of realism to the action. The script sees Stallone's iconic slugger facing a new fight, this time against a form of cancer, which adds depth and pathos to the movie, whilst Creed battles not only with his identity but also struggles to balance his relationship with pretty singer Bianca (Tessa Thompson) with his boxing career. Director Ryan Coogler handles the drama and the fighting with aplomb, getting an excellent performance from Sly and delivering a superb final match for the ending, Adonis going the distance with Scouse champion 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan (Tony Bellew). Adonis doesn't get the title, being defeated on points, but in my eyes he's a winner, the young fighter successfully taking on the mantle of boxing superstar from one of cinema's most enduring and beloved characters.Also worthy of note is the wonderful score by Ludwig G√∂ransson, which makes the movie feel like an epic spaghetti western at times, the composer only occasionally turning to Bill Conti's instantly recognisable theme for support."
" Amazing!
",2019-09-03 00:00:00,8,"Since 2013's Fruitville Station, Ryan Coogler has seen plenty of artistic and financial success, with films like Black Panther and this one. He's had a fruitful partnership with Michael B. Jordan, who plays Adonis Creed, the son of original Rocky nemesis, Apollo Creed. It was released on the fortieth anniversary of the original film and earned Sylvester Stallone a nomination for Best Supporting Actor, his first Oscar notice since that very same original movie.Adonis Johnson is in a Los Angeles youth home after yet another fight when the wife of his father, Mary Anne Creed (Phylicia Rashad) takes him in. Much like his father - who he never met - he dreams of being a fighter. However, because Apollo died in the ring thirty years ago, his adoptive mother opposes him ever putting on the gloves.After being turned down at the Delphi Boxing Academy, which is managed by the son of Apollo's trainer Tony ""Duke"" Evers, our hero sets out for Philadelphia and asks Rocky to become his trainer. This is when we learn a very important part of the mythos - the results of the secret fight at the end of Rocky III were that Apollo beat Rocky in their rubber match.Now known as Hollywood Donnie, Adonis gets a fight team made up of several of Rocky's friends and a love interest in Bianca. Word gets out that he's the son of Apollo Creed and that sets up a match with world light heavyweight champion ""Pretty"" Ricky Conlan (real-life boxer Tony Bellew), who is about to go to prison. Donnie will be his final challenger, as long as he changes his name to Adonis Creed.By all rights, this movie should not work. Yet impossibly it does, beyond expectations. It's incredibly emotional, particularly after watching every Rocky Balboa movie over the last few weeks. Seeing the once strong and proud boxer battle against not just non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but the loss of not just Adrian - as shown in Rocky Balboa - but now Paulie as well and his son moving away is almost too much to bear.I love that Stallone was willing to take a back seat for this film, both in the writing and directing, as well as being the star. It's probably the most perfect film in the series since the first one. The world that's been built, from the past to today, feels authentic."
" My Review!
",2019-08-29 00:00:00,8,"If this was the last flick in it's series of our Italian Stallion, I with a heavy heart say, ""I couldn't have asked for a better one"". Michael B Jordan did a fabulous job being a ""Creed"". This guy has been earning respect in some of the Hollywood movies and the best in the TV series The Wire. When you watch a Rocky movie, it's all about feeling, motivation and all the good stuff that inspires you to do some hard work in real life. Words merely cannot describe the love that I've have for Sylvester Stallone. Rocky movies admirers, Pl. do not watch this movie at home and instead hit the big screens. If you don't, you're NOT a Rocky fan.Peace Out!"
" A thumping sports classic.
",2019-08-13 00:00:00,10,"At its heart, Creed is a feel-good movie. It is a massively entertaining feel-good movie, with lots of great emotional moments. Michael B Jordan takes the franchise torch and leads the way with Creed, as the son of a legendary boxer who has difficulty trying to forge his own path against the backdrop of his dad's name and fame. He wants to prove something, but what?Major props go to Sylvester Stallone. One might think he would be bored playing Rocky so much. Even if that were true, he produces the best Rocky after the original movie. He plays old, wise man Rocky, who is still troubled by thoughts of death and his wife, Adrian. Creed and Rocky are an excellent combination, and Jordan and Rocky have a beautiful chemistry that can go on for years if the studio chooses to squeeze a franchise out of it. Credits also go to Tessa Thompson. You may accuse the movie of having filler scenes, but they're all great filler scenes, simply because she was in them. However, she eventually proves to play a vital role in Creed's life.Creed is the best movie in the whole Rocky franchise when it comes to technique. The first professional fight that Creed gets into was shot in one take. ONE TAKE, and it was way too awesome. It takes serious balls to do that, and skill to do it well, which this movie does. The final fight was extremely well shot, too. I love the decision of the movie to not use the classic Rocky score until and unless it was needed; possibly a metaphor for Creed's own story. The score is original, and memorable. I'll never forget the scene in which Jordan runs with the bikes soundtracked to (aptly) Philadelphia rapper Meek Mill, with traces of the score mixed. Great use of music.I didn't expect this movie to be so good. Where most of us Rocky fans would have thought that this was another cheap attempt to make money, director Ryan Coogler proves otherwise. It convinced Marvel he was ideal for Black Panther (which he was eventually anyway). Creed 2 may not have been so good, either. But this movie, much like Adonis Creed, was not a mistake.Edit: Creed is one of the best sports movies of all time."
" Ruins Apollo Creed's legacy
",2019-07-14 00:00:00,10,"I do not like the premise of this film: that Apollo Creed was a weak, defective man who cheated on his handsome wife (who was played by Sylvia Meals and was never Mrs Huxtable) and betrayed his two LEGITIMATE children by having an affair and spawning the scowl-faced crybaby Adonis. Where are Apollo's two other children? Why are they nowhere to be seen?It takes Apollo's legacy (that of a fine, upstanding gentleman with honour who died doing what he loved best), and urinates all over it just for us to witness the legacy of this illegitimate thug who is not man enough to make his own way in life but instead has to hound Rocky to hold his hand of which he is yet to let go.It wasn't enough that Stallone killed off our beloved Apollo. He then had to paint him as an unfaithful philanderer just to give Rocky some more air time. Still it is nice to be back at Adrian's restaurant and there are some nice touches to the film."
" Great movie
",2019-07-02 00:00:00,5,This is a great movie. It has a great story line. It also has great acting. 7.6 is overrating it. Creed II is better. Rocky Balboa is also better. Rocky V is also better. Rocky IV is also better.
" my notes
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,8,"Awesome movie. perfect progression into the 7th movie in the series and sets up future movies as well. great story, great acting, awesome music, BEASTLY fight scenes. good character relationships and depth. Very deep if your not just looking for a boxing movie. emotionally powerful at times. had the same feel and essence of the previous movies with lots of big and small details that relate back to the other movies, while also being a major upgrade in most areas (3 viewings)"
" Not bad, but not great. Some great stuff, but overall, some empty parts
",2019-06-10 00:00:00,6,"Michael B Jordan did a great job acting in this. I thought Stallone did as well, and overall, the supporting cast was fine. Beginning made it hard to get into, as the opening scenes seemed hard to understand and either not well written, not well directed, or not well acted (when creed was a child meeting his stepmom).It is missing a kind of zeitgeist identity, a presence of authentic passion in some of the filmmaking choices. For example, the juxtaposition between the wealth of Creed's family mansion and the working class environment of philly never felt rich. When Creed and Bianca meet at a restaurant, there is no identity of the restaurant, it's just a normal restaurant, for example. We dont feel that the environment of LA is one of spoiled behavior, instead, we are told Creed just doesnt want it. And so on.Would have been a very interesting storytelling hook if, instead of Rocky telling Creed in the middle of his first fight how Apollo beat him if he had been working on a ""hook"" or a secret weapon to develop, a secret insight all along. After I saw it transpire in the way it did, I couldnt help thinking how amazing the story points would have shifted if, earlier in the training, Rocky said let me show you a technique. ""work on this move. When the fighter does this, do this. And trust me, he will."" And upon Creed resisiting it Rocky saying ""you asked me who won the third fight between me and your father, this is how he won.""And then, during his first fight, the whole time, Creed is doing as he did, showing his hard work, but always looking for that secret insight into overvcoming his opponent. And then, when he finally wins, it is because Rocky has actually connected him to the string that binds him to his father.I couldnt help thinking this. And although I would agree I shouldnt write the movie that someone else wrote, as they had their own intentions, the point being that there was something missing from this being an original and really grabbing story. We are supposed to somehow rely on the previous rocky movies too much, instead of this story doing the work for us.I just find that movies have lost a lot of the magic they once had because the art of storytelling is being lost along the way.Overall, not bad, but I wish for something even just a bit more. I recommend it if you want something to watch, but not for something beyond just a date night or general entertainment,"
" WOW!
",2019-06-01 00:00:00,8,"There's no other way to say it; Creed is a knockout.From start to finish, this film exhilarates and crackles with brilliant on screen performances and masterfully directed fight sequences. It wholeheartedly captures what was so brilliant about the first film: the characters. Yes, I'll return to theaters to see the fights, but it's the characters, particularly Rocky and Adonis that truly captivated me from start to finish.I can't say enough great things about writer/director Ryan Coogler. The way he masterfully captures the modern spirit of Philadelphia and the visceral tension of standing toe-to-toe with a man who wants to see you hit the ground is second to none. What stood out the most, however, was his writing of Rocky Balboa. The subtle nuances that we love about the Italian Stallion are effortlessly worked into the script and flow like water from Sly's crooked mouth. Speaking of, the script would be for naught if it weren't for the beautiful performances by Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone. I'm not ashamed to say I was brought to tears at various parts of this film.I'm just so happy to say that this film wasn't a disappointment. This film exceeded my wildest hopes of a 7th Rocky installment and had me feeling amped up for hours after the credits rolled. I can't wait to see more from the talent involved in this film, and I proudly endorse and recommend Creed to Rocky fans and film fans alike."
" A Rocky film for the next generation
",2019-05-28 00:00:00,7,"Let me say that Creed won't win points for being better than the Rocky movies just because it's ""newer"" and looks more ""real"". But it's still a solid entry in the franchise that will encourage viewers to step into the ring again.The movie follows Adonis Johnson-Creed, the unknown son of Apollo Creed, who tries to make a name for himself while not completely adapting to his late father's legacy. It's entertaining to see Rocky train Adonis in the same ways we saw himself learn from Mickey in the previous films. Most of the film I believe pays homage to the originals, example: Adonis and Bianca's relationship is similar to Rocky and Adrian. The theme song ""Gonna fly now"", Is brought back.The things I didn't like about it was that unlike Rocky, Adonis has a lot more attitude and temper, and causes a lot more harm unintentionally. But the movie was worth me buying it on blu-ray."
" Real drama
",2019-05-24 00:00:00,9,"Oh my God I love this movie. Creed is exactly what the Rocky movies should have been. It's probably the best boxing movie I have ever seen in a decade. Creed got the most and realistic amazing boxing scenes ever filmed, where you actually feel that you are watching it live, it's amazing guys. Michael B Jordan and Sylvester Stallone have great chemistry and you really are on their side when the boxing brutality goes down in the ring. If you love Rocky then Creed is a film you most not avoid its that good."
" A strong counterpoint to the first ""Rocky.""
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,8,"Another one of those Remake Sequels (or ""Requels"") akin to what ""Jurassic World"" was to ""Jurassic Park"".
Still, despite the story playing out in almost the same fashion as its Best Picture predecessor, there are definitely a few differences that make it worth the watch. First is the comparison between a 1970's Philadelphia as compared to the city we now know today. A lot has changed in these many years and this film certainly reflects the reality we live in today. Second is the complexity of the character arcs. Living in a father's shadow, coping with the loss of a family and a career, finding acceptance in a former enemy. Lastly, while I would want to say that Stallone's performance is worthy of his second nomination, it is unfortunately due to a cliche, Oscar bait reason that I feel he has been recognized.
While this film cannot stand on its own without (at least) the first ""Rocky"" movie, it should be seen as a strong counterpoint to the fantastic film that was created decades ago."
" Don't know where to start...
",2019-05-16 00:00:00,1,"As a big Rocky fan this movie is just a travesty. The fact this gets a 7.6 rating on IMDB while Rocky II gets a 7.2 just makes me want to dig my own grave. I guess I can't blame Hollywood for cashing in on lazy uninspired garbage like this if the masses are this easily pleased. This movie neither captures the enduring heart and motivation of the first 3, the guilty pleasure elements of IV and V, or the fan service rehash of Rocky Balboa. It has no appeal once so ever.Creed's son is completely un-likeable and has zero charisma at all on screen. I would expect the son of Apollo Creed to have a lot more fire in his persona. They don't properly stage his transformation at all, in fact it couldn't have been done any worse. So the movie starts, he walks into the local tough guy gym and beats the 6th best boxer in his weight class with one punch? As an audience member I got so much satisfaction having him start at that high level! He quits his cozy office job and we aren't given any reason why except ""gotta be like my dad."" They don't show him struggling in the corporate world or anything.They don't establish the villain at all. In every Rocky movie you gotta hate the villain, so much so that when Rocky starts training you feel like you're the one training cause you want to beat them so bad! In Creed I couldn't care less, they start the training before the opposing fighters have any sort of trash talking or confrontation. That's like Rocky movie 101. There's a forced romance between Creed and a poor man's Rhianna which is just cringe worthy and takes up about half the screen time."
" Like Watching Paint Dry!
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,4,"I really liked the early Rocky movies, but this lacks pace, passion and purpose! Don't waste your time with it."
" Chubby Liverpudlian man
",2019-04-14 00:00:00,5,"Ricky conell is the worlds most out of shape boxer, and possibly the least threatening.he made me laugh throughout, taking me out of the film. Overall pretty good he's no rocky"
" Great stand alone movie. Should include the nostalgia of the 80's movies
",2019-04-02 00:00:00,9,"Michael B Jordan has a lot of potential as a new protagonist but what makes Rocky so relatable is his humility and empathy which are key to the franchise.
I think they still need to find Adonis' unique traits (what makes him relatable) if he are to carry on the franchise on his own. Dramatically and physically he does a tremendous job and the story is compelling as well."
" Wow....
",2019-03-27 00:00:00,3,"Any movie making audiences recoil within a minute, might not be worth the struggle of sitting through them.
Script and directing would've held it's ground in the 80's and 90's, but by today's standards is naive at best.
It took me about 13 minutes to give up on the movie - a lot longer than the it took the movie to give up on realism."
" The other truly great Rocky film
",2019-03-20 00:00:00,10,"I would be hard pressed to say if this film or the 1st Rocky was the better film. It is remarkable the way this film expands the franchise in interesting directions-Rocky as sage and embracing his frailty is just so right-while also being true its roots. Don grappling with being Apollo's kid makes for a different sort of underdog story and yet the big parts of the formula are present and effective. Th story is at once completely new but comforting familiar. I love that this film refocused a good length of the story onto the interpersonal relationships and it tells a great love story, just like the first Rocky.The best part of the film through is the direction, The use of long takes and steady cam work in the fights is brilliant work. The fights feel alive, more realistic and yet still have an operatic edge to them that fights the Rocky formula. The 2nd fight especially is show case of direction and visual flare that stands apart as some of best footage in the series. This film is the only sequel to really capture the ironies-how blue collar settings are juxtaposed with spectacle as Americana-of the first film. It is updated but the essence is the same.Stallone gives an utterly touching performance in this film and I love how the character was developed. But Jordan carries this film and he is a great every man to center the story. Jordan is charismatic and sexy. He just the sort of guy worth rooting for.Great film!"
" Solid New Direction
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,6,"Was really impressed with the overall experience and movie. While not better then the original, it's far better then Balboa. With luck they will keep this thing moving forward, taking hits. Cause that's how winning's done!"
" The most intense and heart-touching movie I've watched in a long time!
",2019-03-02 00:00:00,7,"Whether you've watched the 'Rocky' movies or not, this movie will enlighten your spark to go ahead and watch those previous films. Creed is more than a simplistic boxing movie, it's a movie established upon past achievements, a movie with the intention to motivate and move you, a movie built up on love, desire, ideals, relatability.
The relationships between Adonis, Bianca, Rocky Balboa and Mary-Ann Creed are powerful and thought-provoking. The power between these individuals creates a reflection for anyone striving to achieve something life-fulfilling, but need people by their sides to accomplish their ambitions. The sense of family in this film tells you, 'you don't need to fight alone; we'll be by your side if you'll let us.
The opposing boxers in this film may appear to be hot-headed, family taunting animals, but the film allows its audience to genuinely empathise with their personal circumstances and recognise them as humans. Everyone has a struggle in this movie, as they do in real life, so whether you dislike some of the characters or not, there is a struggle that's displayed up in your face quite often throughout this film.
The cinematography for the boxing fights is sincere to how they are, on TV, traditionally. As I stated, this isn't just a simplistic boxing film, it stays true to the adrenaline that we feel when watching two opponents threaten each other, which allows us to ponder who's really going to stay out on top. Blood, sweat, anger, arguments: all of these ingredients are implemented in this film and are blended beautifully.
This has to be the most intense film I've watched in a long time. Once you finish this film and the credits start to roll, you should have taken at least one piece of inspiration from this film. Are you aspiring to be something? Well, don't try and catch it alone, and apply everything in your power to get back up, because you have a reputation to light."
" Pregame Hype
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,9,"Ryan Coogler has created one of the most inspirational, dramatic, and captivating sports movies of all time. Creed follows the story of Adonis Creed in his early stages of his boxing career. He struggles to make a name for himself as he follows in the footsteps of his late father, Apollo Creed, who had controversially been the best boxer in the world before he died in the ring. Adonis is caught in his father's shadow and is hit with the question of , ""Can he be as good as his father?"" With barely anyone behind his back, he turns to his father's friend and former world champion boxer, Rocky Balboa, to train him. As Rocky takes him in like the son he never had, Adonis improves dramatically in his skill and technique of boxing and is met with his toughest challenge to date: facing the world's number one heavyweight boxer, ""Pretty"" Ricky Conlan. With actors who perfectly fit the character roles, a complex plot displaying inspirational values, and breathtaking music blending in seamlessly into individual scenes, this movie is worth watching over and over again.
The characters in Creed are portrayed perfectly by every single actor. Every aspect of each character is displayed through speech and action. The two main characters, Adonis and Rocky, obviously play an important role in creating a captivating story. Adonis, played by Micheal B. Jordan, is introduced as a scrappy young boy in juvenile prison. He grows up to be a strong man with the same personality who feels the urge to be in the ring fighting against another boxer. This character of Adonis is perfectly displayed through Micheal B. Jordan's acting. He fully takes on the role as this temperamental fighter who has the drive to accomplish anything he believes in. In personal scenes of Adonis, feelings are very much felt by the audience. Rocky, played by Sylvester Stallone, is my personal favorite character. Rocky's character originates from the original movie series Rocky, where he was a world champion boxer and very close friends with Apollo Creed. In Creed, Sylvester Stallone plays the most emotional character by far. Sylvester Stallone acting as an aged old man who lost his entire family pulls off nothing but perfection. With a depressed, slightly humorous, caring character, Stallone fits right in. His verbal and physical acting allows for the audience to clearly see the tired, old character he is right off the bat. Micheal B. Jordan, Sylvester Stallone, and the rest of the cast allow the movie to feel personal and full of life.
Correlating to the main topic of the movie, boxing, Creed clearly displays reoccurring themes based around determination and fight. By having a plot which brings out different elements of struggle, it truly enhances the feeling of the movie to a more personal level. We can see an example of this in Adonis's struggle to not only win the biggest fight in his career, but to beat back the social expectations of being a Creed, which has haunted him ever since he was a young child. This is also seen in the very emotional journey through Rocky's unexpected experience through cancer. As the two main characters fight their own individual battles, they come together to display a real sense of friendship. These two strong, reoccurring themes of friendship and determination give the movie a sense of value and really allow the audience to take something great away from it.
The music of Creed is an amazing compilation of captivating music which will make you cry, hype you up, and take you through a roller coaster of excitement. The motion picture soundtrack, composed by Ludwig Goransson, perfectly fits the scenes of Creed. With two different contrasting themes, we are easily able to tell the mood and feel the emotion of the movie. When the main subject of the movie is Rocky, we hear a peaceful, slightly depressing sort of tune playing softly. These moments evoke a calm, relaxing mood for the audience to take in. During the times focused around Adonis, we hear a hip hop style of music. This brings out his youth and uprising while giving us moments of ""hype"" as we see him fight his opponents in the ring.
Creed is a special movie which had me wide-eyed and nearly drooling for over an hour. The plot of this movie is one of the most inspirational and real-feeling movies I have seen with my own eyes. The journey of Adonis Creed during his uprising in the boxing arena is one of much heart, grit, and emotion. It had me captivated on a whole new level to the point where I was completely taken over for the next day with images of boxing in my mind. If there is any movie that you would watch as pregame hype, Creed would be on the top of my list. With great actors to support the roles of an amazing plot and music to fit seamlessly into every scene, Creed will have you hitting the gym and getting yourself a pair of boxing gloves in no time."
" Good riddance Paulie!!!!
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,8,"Good movie, and good choice of direction for the Rocky series! Even though it is ""Creed"", it did a really good job picking up after the last ""Rocky"" movie and keeping the continuity, flow, and history! I gotta admit, about the 1 1/2 hour mark, I could feel the ol' Rocky magic pumping me up! And at about the two hour mark I was misting up! I didn't really like the love story aspect, or her music, but the rest of the film hit (pun intended!) all the right notes for me! Stallone is pretty good as ""unc"" Rocky, and Phylicia Rashad really owned the screen for the brief moments she was on it! The part where she says that she was the one to wipe Apollo's ass when he couldn't was pretty real, and strong!And, I know this will come off jerky, but I was so glad not to see Paulie! I really hated that character! So long ya' jerk!"
" Successful attempt to extend the story
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,8,"In this film, I saw all the patterns that are inherent in boxing / fighting movies. But they are all intertwined well and in the end create a good continuation of what seems to be a complete story, but with a different thread. Particularly pleased with the unconventional film finale.
In general, if you did not watch Rocky, there is no tight binding, you can watch this movie separately."
" Decent outing in which Rocky Balboa takes a mentor to combat powerful contenders
",2019-01-23 00:00:00,7,"Boxoffice smash about a young man who attempts to become a boxing champion, thanks to the great Rocky Balboa, Sylvester Stallone. Good spin-of with the previous heavyweight champion, nowadays ill and retired, serving as a coach to Adonis Johnson, Michael B Jordan, son of his former friend and rival Apollo Creed . As Adonis dreams of becoming a boxing champion to win fame and fortune, as his late father Apollo : Carl Weathers , but the long way results to be hard-working and difficult. As Adonis first has to confront a tough boxer called Danny Stuntman Wheeler : Ward, and , shortly after, it eventually leads to a final showdown, the world championship. As Adonis combats the world lightweight champion, Pretty Ricky Conlan : Tony Bellew, who is well trained by an astute coach : Graham McTavish .This is a nice following to long running Rocky series in which it takes parts of Rocky I, II and Rocky IV. It relies too heavily on uplifting ideas from earlier Rocky movies. As Stallone/Rocky takes the Burguess Meredith role as trainer and mentor to newcomer boxer. As Rocky takes in a protege, training him in the style that made him a champ. As there are attractive and moving scenes about training and extreme endeveour. Support cast is pretty good, such as : Tessa Thompson as Creed's girlfriend, Phylicia Rashad as his mother, Graham McTavish, among others . And brief appearance of Dolph Lundgren as Ivan Drago as prologue to Creed II, 2018, directed by Steven Coples with similar cast , in which Adonis faces off against Viktor Drago son of Ivan Drago who appeared in Rocky 3.Lavishly and efficiently financed , including spectacular combats, by the saga producers : Irwin Winkler, Robert Chartoff , his son William Chartoff and Sylvester Stallone himself. It packs a colorful and adequate cinematography by Marysse Alberty. As well as a pounding and stirring musical score by Ludwig Gorasson. The motion picture was competently written and directed by Ryan Coogler, though without originaly, because he simply copies the prior Rocky movies. Coogler is a fine craftsman who has written and directed a few and enjoyable films, such as Fruitvale station starred by Michael B Jordan, Black Panther and Scenes for minors Tv series. Rating : Above average. Well worth watching. The overall effect is to prepare you for the next sequel."
" Same old story.
",2019-01-21 00:00:00,6,"Creed (2015) Tells a new chapter of the Rocky franchise while seemingly being a kind of remake. It follows Rocky Balboa, a former World Heavyweight Champion, as he battles cancer and serves as a trainer and mentor to Adonis Johnson, the son of his late friend and former rival Apollo Creed. While having some unique turns and some great direction and editing, it seems as though every Rocky related film follows the same formula that gets boring after a while. They fight, they lose, the train and fight again only to win or lose, learning some kind of important lesson and dealing with the current drama. I can see where some people might like the story, but I find it is the same old thing over and over again."
" A Knockout
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,9,"""Creed"" (2015) is a professionally produced drama about an unknown boxer, Adonis Johnson son of famed boxer Apollo Creed played by Michael B. Jordan, as he enlists the training of his father's biggest rival and eventual friend, Rocky Balboa played by Sylvester Stallone, and tries to make a name for himself. This film is full of ups and downs and has a very serious emotional impact for me. It gave me a sense of pride to watch Adonis leave a life he where he wasn't happy and chase after a dream. I also am extremely happy that this storyline that is mostly recycled from ""Rocky"" was adapted successfully for an African American character. I really enjoyed this film.The acting was more than spectacular. Having watched this film several times, I continuously find myself thrown into the film because it feels so real. The color grading in this film is indicative of the mood which helps to elevate the emotions that are portrayed and assists in the implantation of the audience in the film. Director Ryan Coogler did a marvelous job getting the best out of his actors, using creative camera angles and shots, and delivering a story that can possibly rival the original ""Rocky"" saga. Overall, I love this film. It is very sound and I think everyone should give it watch especially after watching the original ""Rocky."""
" Great example of a successful adaptation to a franchise
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,9,"This week I watched Creed. The logline reads ""The former World Heavyweight Champion Rocky Balboa serves as a trainer and mentor to Adonis Johnson, the son of his late friend and former rival Apollo Creed."" The movie had an engaging plot line that dealt with real life matters. As an aspiring writer I feel that the humanity that was pulled into the story remained true to the Rocky franchise. This heart-warming story turns what could have been a proponent of evil into a proponent of rising above. I feel what separates this film from others of its kind is it's ironic message of life amongst a sport of destruction. I personally don't think that I would have done anything differently to this film. Having been produced by two of Hollywood's Major Minor's, the technical aspects of the production did not disappoint. Aside from the writing, the editing also really stood out in this film. The pacing was really good and the story was really allowed to breathe. All in all, I was glad that I finally watched this movie and would definitely watch it again."
" Creed lands every Jab, Hook, and Uppercut of Hollywood success with ease
",2019-01-16 00:00:00,9,"Whether you're a veteran of the vast eight installment Rocky franchise viewer, or your own up-and-coming movie-going champion, Creed does not fail to hit you with a twelfth round knockout. The film follows a formula similar to Sylvester Stallone's original Rocky from 1976, but with extraordinary flashes of new era drip and style. The film hooks at legacy, love, and adversity all within a 2 hour and 13 minute runtime. Moviegoers may think that they will know the premise of a Rocky film but also be incredibly satisfied and otherwise blown away by the movies success to crown a new champion of the fighting genre as light heavyweight champion of the world.The film introduces the audience to a new character Adonis Creed, played by actor Michael B Jordan, who is the forgotten son of world renowned boxer Apollo Creed. After Apollo dies in a boxing match against Ivan Drago in Rocky IV, Adonis is born and put into foster care after his unknown mother later dies as well. Adonis is drawn to seek achievement and legacy in the boxing world and travels to Philadelphia to find his late father's best friend in Rocky Balboa for training played by none other than Sylvester Stallone. Creed jounces about the streets of Philadelphia finding love and success in the boxing world and is put to the ultimate test of grit and perseverance with a match that'll determine his career and birthright. Director Ryan Coogler provides a Hollywood character of color that is able to avoid the stereotypes of the prototypical role yet still be famed as one. And although this is the first time we don't see Stallone's name on the script of a Rocky film, we still see his character as a focal point of the movie as he juggles another rise to stardom with his own aging career.One of Coogler's other works Black Panther is also testament of a main protagonist of color that diverts from the norm of Hollywood blockbusters. Prevalent in Coogler's films is the thematic display of a rags-to-riches story where a character has lost it all and needs to regain their fame, or build something from a supposed nothing by themselves, crucial in the old-fashioned Rocky series.A beautifully notable facet of the film is the exceptional photography and costume/makeup design. Creed for a lack of better words does not shy away from remarkable in the direction of photography present in the film. The use of slow motion shots, angle shots, and one-take pieces show viewers the life that Adonis Creed experiences and the position he puts himself in. In one of Creed's matches, the entire sequence is one shot, leading viewers to believe themselves that they would be watching fighters duke it out live. Every punch, each hook, spit of blood, drop of sweat are felt. Every strategy that Balboa tells Creed is heard and then immediately put into action. The costume design gives Adonis the look of an established boxer with knowledge and experience in the classic gritty world. While using odes to the originals like Balboa's famous climb of the Philadelphia Museum of art, or his iconic sweat suit, Creed is able to invigorate the new age of sports and athleticism. An example even better is the combination of the photography and makeup seen in one of Creed's fights, showing the literal blood, sweat, and tears of fighting for a living.Creed examines the desire and drive of athletes wanting to make an impact in their realm of sports, but also explores the setbacks, motives, and toughness required to do so. Compounding off the grind to achieve greatness in sports is even seen in Michael B. Jordan's physique in the movie. In order to look the part of a determined boxer, Jordan had to gain muscle strength and cut fat for a lean and athletic greek god-like look. Along with his look he had to learn how to actually box and did so to an impressive level that fans will see and appreciate his speed and agility in the cinematic ring.Stallone encapsulates his most famed character once again with exceptional content and ease. Stallone at an age of 69 during the movies filming, performs like he's no more than a day over forty. Reanimating the stoic tough guy that is Rocky Balboa, Stallone is able to creatively add new depths to the well loved character that we hadn't seen before. Coming 39 years after the original punch it out installment of the world's most popular boxing franchise, Creed satisfies the heirlooms of the series without merely recreating them. It provides all the nostalgia of a timeless thriller, and wins the fans with a twelfth round TKO."
" Essentially an updated Rocky
",2019-01-15 00:00:00,7,"This movie has been done six times prior to Creed, but its superior execution and presentation elevates the story. Unlike many of the other rocky films, it feels as though there is genuine drama in the lives of Adonis and Rocky, although not all of the scenes work. The scene where Adonis gets into a fight in the club felt unnatural and Rocky's cancer felt very hamfisted and unearned. Otherwise, this movie mostly hits all of right notes emotionally, and the fight choreography was good as usual. It's worth checking out even for those who did not like Rocky, as it doesn't have the same dated feeling. Overall, this is a solid entry that is able to stand on its own."
" The perfect movie to see !
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,10,"I think Creed was THE best movie I've ever seen!
It's the story about someone who doesn't have a father and need a positive male figure in this life and he finds it. Ryan Coogler did a really great job with this movie, it was so impressive! And it did not became boring at all. There was so many emotional scenes who affected me but not in a sentimental way. Michael B. Jordan was such a beautiful and great actor, my heart breaks every time when he's fighting. Syllvester Stallone will be Rocky Balboa forever! It's looks like he takes care of Adonis like his baby, him and Michael B. Jordan were the perfect duo. The boxing was excellent and the characters brilliant!
Let me talk about the make up artist that did a perfect job! Mostly in the oxing scenes, it looks so real! And the score was incredible too, mostly in the battles, it was so well composed. This film was a mix of interesting, suspense, funny, moving and captivating scenes that I've been laughing or been affected in every moment. Creed was so original and convincing! I would watch it a thousand times! I rated this movie ten out of ten because it deserves it!
And I can't say anything negative about it. You just have to watch this movie, I promise you will not waste your time."
" Rocky And Creed Are Back!
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,9,"Creed (or Rocky 7 as it also feels) introduces us to a new lead character, Adonis (Michael B Jorden, who we've seen recently in the poor remake of Fantastic 4). Adonis has grown up from birth without a father, having no direction & no real purpose in life. This all changes when Adonis learns that his father was a known boxing professional known as ""Apollo Creed"" (Character remembered best for Rocky 1, 2, 3 & 4). This discovery sets Adonis on a new path which may possibly change his life forever...As Adonis learns more about his father, he tracks down the well known Rocky Ballboa (Sylvester Stallone), seeking a new mentor as Adonis decide like his father to take up the boxing gloves.I'm happy announce that of all the Rocky films, this one is my favourite. The film's strength is completely run by our two leads actors and both have done an outstanding job as both roles would have been pushing limits. I'll even make the call and say that Stallone got robbed, as I feel he deserved best supporting actor of 2015 for this film. I am more than happy with the new lead, acted by Michael B Jorden, who I can't even compare to his work in Fantastic 4- redeemed!This film is not just a film about boxing. The film goes a lot deeper than anything I was ever expecting and also deeper compared to the previous Rocky films.Creed is a film that will motivate you. Every time Stallone speaks, you, as the viewer feel you are the one to comply with his actions. Creed also shares the journey of two men that have both suffered in many ways and even with different pasts, share so much. There are certain theme here that I won't spoil that have truly made me cry at least twice in the film (See- I'm a real man for admitting it).Our only disappoint with Creed is of cause this film wouldn't be complete without a boy meeting a girl. I don't hate this but I do feel this part of the story is simply too common for this type of film and was used only as must have formula.The main messages I got from the film is pure gold (slight spoiler here): in this day and age the fights we face daily we should never fight alone, be proud of who are and where you've from.Creed's a Knockout!8.8/10

" CONLAN WINS THE FIGHT, CREED WINS THE NIGHT
",2019-01-09 00:00:00,8,"Lets be honest, Creed is so different from any Rocky movie. In the same time it is so loyal to first one. And it feels it is 6th's sequel, we can see the connection. Story is awesome, cast is amazing. Micheal B. Jordan looks so ambitious, as though he has Eye of the Tiger. His motivation is super duper great. On other hand, we have Tessa Thompson. Im so close to fall in love with her, really. Her character has well written. And absolutely, we have the big shot Sly Stallone. There are nothing to say about him. He is just a legend. But if I had to add something, I can say his acting is better than his young version. Being old has a positive effect on him. But in this movie, director is not Stallone, we have a different guy from other Rocky movies. He is Ryan Coogler. He is amazing, Im so thankful to him for making this world so better and creating another great story about these perfect characters. He proves Rocky franchise has built their own universe. There are lots of great references to earlier movies like chicken training, giving some screen time to Adrian and Paulie characters. I shocked when I realised Paulie is dead. He was the only survivor from first Rocky expect Stallone. But in the same time, I was expecting to see some characters like Little Marie or other children of Apollo Creed. Where are they now? Anyway, Creed has great fight scenes, technically they are perfect. And it has very inspiring training scenes. Also this movie has a great humour, I raised a laugh during the ""cloud"" thing. Finally, best thing this movie have is making an incredible final fight and making whole movie is like a new solo movie. And worst thing it have is not creating a so intense villian. This is my second favourite Rocky movie so far. I cant wait for second Creed movie."

After some persuasion, Balboa agrees to train Johnson which eventually garners the attention of undefeated champion Ricky Conlan (Tony Bellew) and his manager Tommy Holiday (Graham McTavish). The stage then becomes set for 2 of the best to fight it out in a 12 round match, but who will end up victorious?I usually try and judge each film I see on its own merits and don't like to jump on the bandwagon and bash a film just because it's 'unoriginal and unnecessary' but at the same time with Creed it's very difficult not to approach reviewing it from this angle based on the fact that it does come across a lot like a patchwork quilt of other Rocky films.Director and screenwriter Ryan Coogler has clearly tried to take this film back to its roots and presumably give it a look and feel of the original Rocky. This is a brave move when you consider that the same person who directed the original Rocky wasn't able to get this right when he tried to do this in Rocky V - Creed isn't as bad as Rocky V so perhaps Coogler has learned from some of Avildsen's mistakes.I think one of the main issues with Creed lies with its protagonist Adonis Johnson; the thing that made the original Rocky film work is that Balboa was humble and likeable and given the fact that he came from nothing and worked his way to the top made his journey heart-warming and meant that Rocky was an endearing character. Johnson has none of these qualities; he's got a good job, he lives well and at times he comes across as being a bit brattish and obnoxious. Don't get me wrong I didn't expect him to be exactly like Balboa, but for me he should have been somewhere in the middle. Some may argue that he's Creed's son and that he's a chip off the old block - yes Apollo Creed was unlikeable, but he was the villain in the first 2 films and even when he was one of the good guys in Rocky 3 and 4 he still had a sort of flamboyant swagger about him which made him fun to watch. Michael B Jordan is a reasonably good actor, but at times he's a little flat here and doesn't seem to have much energy or zip about him.Another issue lies with the general narrative itself; it's all over the place - characters are introduced briefly and then disappear for long periods of time and then other characters are introduced for no real reason (such as the character of Wheeler). Coogler also takes far too long to set the story up and considering that Johnson ends up fighting in what can be described as 'the fight of his life' the training sessions are limited and once again feel very reminiscent of one's that we've seen over the years in the Rocky franchise. Another narrative weakness lies with Johnson's childhood like how and why he ended up in a detention centre? Why his biological mother turned up out of the blue after what 13 years? Where was she the rest of the time and more to the point where was he? Perhaps some of these questions will get addressed in the sequel, but it still seems very lazy to leave so much unaddressed. I pointed out earlier that Rocky's working class roots were one of his most endearing qualities and during the press conference we learn that Conlan followed the same journey as Rocky to get to where he has got to. This left me confused because I then found myself respecting and admiring the villain more than the protagonist which I assume was not the intention here.The final problem with Creed is it's lack of heart and as I've mentioned earlier this does not have the same heart-warming, emotional journey that the original Rocky had and at times parts of the narrative feel a little forced.Still despite all of my objections, I didn't think this film was too bad; some of the fight sequences were OK, but the final fight was really good with a gritty intensity reminiscent of some of the earlier Rocky films. I had issues with Creed JR as a character and whilst I felt that Jordan underplayed too much at times he was still good at other times - although the majority of these good occasions occurred when he was fighting. Stallone has nothing to prove now (essentially now taking on the Mighty Mickey role) and basically gets out of Jordan's way and leaves Jordan to put his own stamp on the film, but he isn't able to do this consistently enough to make this worthy of much more than a mediocre score."
" Michael B. Jordan does Rocky proud
",2018-12-25 00:00:00,10,I'm old time and loved Rocky. I was worried they would screw it up. But Michael B. Jordan is knocking out the movies one at a time. And this was wonderful. Sylvester Stallone found the right person to keep the legacy alive. If your like me and wonder where the good movies have gone I think I just found it. Great Job by all on this one.
" An average for me
",2018-12-12 00:00:00,5,"Watching it after Creed 2, it feels like very close.
Gave a feel of the next generation Rocky coming up, the characterisation was done nicely for all, proper justification for the plot, but still it felt like it could've been better with more nerve bursting, goose bumps scenes as its plot still could've adopted it.
Overall, its an average and one time watch just to get to know the characters to watch further ones in the series."
" Sylvester's worst movie
",2018-12-09 00:00:00,1,Claire Huckstable is not a fighter's mom. Rocky was unenthused. The kid was just a kid who wasn't a very good boxer. The boxing crowd was only 3 people deep. He meets the love of his life first night in Phillie. Come on people. Is this the best u got?
" Don't believe the hype it's a sequel
",2018-12-08 00:00:00,3,"I love Sly, and the rocky series but this movie is absolute rubbish. If you haven't seen it by now, thank your stars and keep scrolling. Predictable formulaic nonsense, it's a one star movie with an extra added for sly and his legacy."
" Retread The Original Rocky For the Second Time But It Works Again
",2018-12-06 00:00:00,9,"Creed is the 7th installment in the Rocky franchise. This time we follow Apollo Creed's son, Adonis Creed. He appears lost at the start of the movie, as he tries to make a name for himself in a boxing gym.Adonis seeks help in Philadelphia from Rocky Balboa, whom he calls ""Unc"". Rocky refuses, but eventually takes the kid under his wing and trains him, similar to the way he was trained. Rocky shows his intellect here, far more than in Rocky V when he managed another fighter. For that matter, although his intellect was prevalent in Rocky Balboa. in Creed, Rocky shows his intellect more than ever.What does Rocky get smarter as he gets older?Most significant for me, is that he takes Adonis to the Front Street Gym, where I used to box, when it was under another name. Adonis gets a girlfriend during the movie, also. Rocky has his own battles to deal with as he has a cancer issue, that does not appear resolved at the end.This climaxes with a fight between Adonis and the champ. of the light heavyweight division. They gave that a touch of Hollywood, and a touch realism at the same time. This complete with very inspiring music, made this worth watching and even buying the DVD."
" Been done before and better
",2018-12-05 00:00:00,4,"Rocky without the heart. Replay of a replay of a replay. Nothing new here.I had unreasonably hoped to see a film that didn't glorify boxing and beating the crap out of another human being. I know, totally illogical expectation, but somehow I had hoped that Stallone in his later years might try to send out a different message.Didn't need another ""Rocky"", right out of the play book. Didn't need another film trying to make heroes out of people getting in a ring and beating each other's brains out. I'm sure the boxing fans got their adrenaline rush out of this, but beyond that this flick was more of a ""been there, done that"" yawner.I give it 4 stars for the acting of Stallone and basic writing. But beyond that this is really no different from any boxing film ever made. More than anything this felt like a ""let's rake in some cash at the box office"" setup... without the heart and soul that carried the first film. Amazing as it may seem, this was a bore-fest that hides what makes people true heroes (and no, the fight with ones health issues theme didn't pull it off. Instead it stuck out like a token actor).In short, It is another ""Rocky"" movie too many. It was trite, cliche and is yet another ""let's glorify boxing"" flick that once again sends home the message that extreme physical violence is totally okay so long as it carries the ""sports"" label. One would have hoped that foolishness ended with the Roman gladiatorial arenas... but seems like the human species blood lust entertainment just never matures."
" Brings back the Rocky memories
",2018-12-02 00:00:00,10,"Interesting angle to continue the Rocky phenomenon. Really enjoyed it. The further I got into the film, the more I bought into the story. It's well put together and Stallone is great. He adds that extra excitement into the mix with his grounded character Rocky. A entertaining film."
" Stallone's best performance in years punctuates a fantastically-written, character-driven experience.
",2018-12-02 00:00:00,8,"Much of the success of 'Creed (2015)' rests on the success, the unexpected yet absolute success, of Stallone's performance as the Rocky character (perhaps his best to date), who's here presented as a regular guy (who used to be a boxer) struggling to find the will to fight (metaphorically) in a world where his friends, family and 'normal' life are essentially all gone. Here, he's been placed in a fantastically-written mentor role - a genius move which has injected life into a franchise that, by all rights, ought to have been long since laid to rest; it's a joy pretty much every moment he's on screen, which can range from the surprisingly sweet to the expertly emotional. The strength of this character and performance doesn't discount anyone else, however, as the overall experience is a well-paced and thematically rich one that's essentially all one long training montage yet does so much in terms of character on the part of pretty much everyone involved. It also ties in the old with the new in extremely clever, heart-string-tugging ways. It's hard not to be moved, at least to some level, and it's practically impossible not to be entertained. 8/10"
" Boring and bad
",2018-12-01 00:00:00,1,"Fell asleep....disastrously dire & boring
Nowhere near 10 !!!"
" Utter rubbish!
",2018-12-01 00:00:00,1,So bad I it's laughable. The acting is so embarrassing. Cringe from start to finish.
" CREED 2015
",2018-12-01 00:00:00,8,"Thought this movie deserves 8 stars as it was very true to life. All actors playing the main parts, played them very sincerely and not over acted in any way. Great story and great training and boxing footage. Not going to bore you with tons of non eventful crap. This film is well worth a watch, I would definitely watch this movie again. Sylvester Stallone plays his part as the trainer superbly. You won't be disappointed and looking forward to watching the next instalment. 8/10"
" I had to stop watching
",2018-11-25 00:00:00,1,"It was just so bad, so tepid. It was like they planned the trailers before the movie. I watched for over an hour and then gave up. The first major fight scene just looked like a staged fight in an amateur theatre. Give this a miss. And I hear they're bringing out a sequel? Dear God no."
" Only really gets interesting when Rocky Balboa enters
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,6,"Creed only really gets interesting when Rocky Balboa enters the movie. I didn't care as much about Adonis and his story - I just wanted to know more about what was going on in Rocky's life. The fight sequences are well done, though, and there is some real emotion in this film. I think of this movie as more of a footnote in the Rocky story than as an official part of the Rocky series."
" This film does for blacks what ""Rocky"" did for whites...
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,8,"When Creed first came out during the busy holiday season, it became a surprise hit at the box office and became one of the biggest movies in the Rocky franchise. Before you see Creed II, check this classic movie out. The title of the movie is named after the last name of the son of Apollo Creed, Adonis (Michael B.Jordan, pre-Black Panther and post Chronicle) who must follow in his late father's footsteps following his death by Ivan Drago in Rocky IV and must train under Rocky while hanging out with friends and falling in love. The soundtrack is killer and the cinematography is amazing, not to mention the boxing scenes. Give this one a shot."
" a new take on rocky
",2018-11-13 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you that just because you come from money and be arrogant doesn't mean you can't strip it all down in order to become humble in order to achieve what you want out of life. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. The cinematography is incredible especially in the scene where it is an homoage to Rocky famous run. A low angle is used to show Anthony Bellow is the villain of the story. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Inspiring
",2018-10-20 00:00:00,10,"Creed is the best Sylvester Stallone movie since his original Rocky in my opinion and I really liked all of the Rocky films.Like Rocky, Creed has heart and exemplifies the tenacity and perseverance of Sylvester Stallone's real life story as he tried to sell the Rocky script to multiple studios only to be continually turned down until eventually getting some interest, but still having to fight to get the studio to agree to allow him to play the lead.I am not a boxing fan by any means, but this movie's story is more than a boxing film. Like Rocky, Creed is a feel-good and inspiring film of someone staying true to themselves and overcoming not only the naysayers and others that are out to crush another's dreams that they can't understand. It's also about Adonis overcoming his own self imposed limitations. For me, Adonis's ability to overcome his self imposed limitations and all the odds against him was inspiring.Yes, this is a gritty movie just like all the other Rocky movies, but it also has nuggets of gold showing that anyone willing to work harder than what anyone else is willing to do can accomplish the impossible.If you like Rocky or like seeing one succeed in following their dreams despite the odds, then this movie is well worth watching."
" It's Hollywood, so don't expect realism
",2018-10-17 00:00:00,6,"Call me a scrooge if you like, but As fight scenes go in movies this one is pretty lame and unrealistic to a fault. Scenes which cost it a few stars and made me laugh (although the stunt scenes are actually pretty good) In the real world this fight would have been stopped at any number of junctures. Most likely is the scene where Creed is knocked out cold for what was easily a 15-20 count (and that was with the slow motion segments, yet he wasn't counted out. No way would he have been allowed to continue. Another scene was when he was hammered numerous times and ended up draped over the top rope, not defending himself. Again, this would have warranted a stoppage. Also, the amount of times the fighters were allowed to wind up and hit one another was astounding. I'm not talking about exchanges, but times when one fighter would basically stand there and allow the other to haul off and swing. Now, I don't mind a little unrealism in film, but scenes like this are way too much for my liking. And the end of the fight? SPOILER!! SPOILER!!! SPOILER!!!
Can you say ""ADRIAN?!?!"" LOL"
" One of the best boxing movies since the Original Rocky
",2018-10-08 00:00:00,9,"When they announced that they were going to make a movie of Apollo Creed's son and that Rocky was going to be a part of it, I was excited. When I actually saw it, it was amazing."

" CRAZY CREED
",2018-09-27 00:00:00,8,"Ok I give this a 8 out of 10. I was more SURPRISED with this FILM. It was way better then I thought IT would be. If they make a sequel I am OK with that. But let's be HONEST let's just make maby #1 or #2 more. But come on HOLLYWOOD. Let's not MESS it all up like the Rocky MOVIES. And make LIKE 6 of them WHY. Because it ruines them after the 3rd One IT gets BORING. 
EXAMPLE: Rocky gets into a Match The Music, There might be a Little Drawn, then OH what happens HE WINS AGAIN. THEN THE MOVIE IS OVER.
IT JUST ENDS THE SAME.
LETS NOT MESS UP CREED. 
The Real Rocky and Movie Fans NO WHO CREEDS DAD IS. 
LETS KEEP HIM THE STAR. IN THE NEXT MOVIE AND HAVE IT KIND OF LEFT AT THAT. FOR A GOOD 10 YEARS OR SO. THEN HE IS STILL AT A DESENT AGE AND COME BACK FOR ONE LAST FIGHT. TOTAL OF CREED #3 LETS NOT OVER DO GREED FOR THE MONEY. 
LETS HAVE PEOPLE WONDER WHAT HAPPENED TO CREED OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS OR SO. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE COMES BACK FOR ONE LAST FIGHT.
HE WAS AWAY IN THE ARMY OR SOMETHING."
" Best Acting Pair In A While
",2018-09-18 00:00:00,9,"Creed is about a young kid who wants to become a pro wrestler. He stumbles upon the legend Rocky and they train for a big fight that he has been invited to.Creed was great. One of the best films of 2015. To start off, the acting pair was awesome. Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone were amazing together. Sylvester even won an Oscar for his performance. The writing was a great adaption to now a days. It was more peppy. The ending was also very surprising. How they got ESPN to work with them was amazing. It made it feel like it was happening in real life. Creed was a great film. If you haven't seen it I would try to go see it. Also the new one is coming out soon."
" A worthy follow up to the original
",2018-09-08 00:00:00,8,"As much as I would like to call this Sly's best performance in a movie, I just can't. I mean what can top his performance in the original? This one, however is a very close second. Michael B. Jordan is obviously the star, is in top form and delivers a knock-out performance, but Sly still steals the show in my opinion. The scene where Rocky argues with Adonis about not wanting to take chemotherapy for his cancer just does it for me. He should've got an academy award for his efforts in that one scene alone. How they made him look so sick as he expressed his pain and grief.Like the original, the movie isn't so much about boxing, as it is about climbing mountains, and fighting personal battles in life. Sly and Jordan share good screen chemistry and give it their all. One necessary plot twist is the discovery of Adonis being the product of his father Apollo Creed's infidelity before he was killed in the ring by Ivan Drago.The musical score is absolutely awesome, Adonis' final fight with ""Pretty Ricky Conlan"" looked very realistic and great performances by all."
" Not Bad, Not Great. Missing the Bells and Whistles and Grit
",2018-09-04 00:00:00,6,"Grit is simple. It's realism. It's captured in speech, in sound and in the visuals. This movie missed Grit.Max Kellerman is awful(Sounds like a guy with an accent rather than an announcer). Modern announcers are awful. Modern action sequences are awful. Too much camera work, too much close up, too much eliminates the moment and the environment. This movie, was okay, but as a fan of Rocky, it's just missing the Rocky feel. In fact, not enough feelings for the son of Apollo and his father. Adonis Creed and Apollo Creed should be more important. Adonis should be haunted and yet, it's NEVER played up. He never questions his manhood, his love of his father or his father's love. Where is the emotion.The fight sequences are poorly shot. Yes, there was a great one take sequence but still....it's about the entire movie. The music doesn't work. The hard work and grit is missing. Seeing sweat and emotional exhaustion is missing. Not just Creed, but almost ALL Hollywood movies. The movie looks too pretty and that's a big problem.I sadly must give Creed a 6 out of 10. Potential, and a solid movie if is here, kist not for the name Legacy Apollo Creed."
" Good but not better than that and definitely not good enough
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,6,"Creed (aka Rocky VII) is a film which is a good film but it definitely isn't In between good and very good or very good or In between very good and excellent and definitely isn't excellent. This film shouldn't have been made and it was completely unnecessary to have a Rocky VII. The character Adonis Johnson aka Adonis Creed also was a man who was a bit stubborn and just didn't listen to people who cared about him. In the beginning of the film when Adonis went to Apollo Creeds Boxing Gym and saw powerful boxers fighting, he asked a Black Guy with a big moustache if he will train him. The guy said no and told him so many times about the guys who box in the Gym he was at were professional experienced fighters and that people get killed, but Adonis ignored that and told the man again to train him and that he could fight well, but the man was firm and again said no which made Adonis leave that Boxing Gym. Adonis also didn't listen to his mother about Boxing and that it was very dangerous and that he didn't have to be like his father Apollo Creed, but again Adonis ignored his mum and didn't listen. When Rocky trained Adonis in the gym Adonis didn't listen to Rocky. When practicing to improve his strength, Adonis had to do some sparring against an opponent who was on his team but started using too much power when punching and Rocky had to tell Adonis to Stop doing it. The film did have some excellent acting by Sylvester Stallone as Rocky, Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Johnson, Tessa Thompson as Bianca, Phylicia Rashad as Mary Anne Creed, Tony Bellew as 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan and Andre Ward as Danny 'Stuntman' Wheeler. The film wasn't intense like some of the Rocky films such as Rocky, Rocky II, Rocky III, Rocky IV or Rocky Balboa. The fight scenes were good but they could have been intense which they weren't. This film doesn't deserve 7.6/10 because besides it being a good film it also is very weak in places. Another that that I can't believe and is absolutely awful is that they're doing a Creed II(aka Rocky VIII), that it is coming out in the U.K on the 30th November 2018, this year and that it again is going to star Dolph Lundgren as Ivan Drago and Florian Munteanu as his son Viktor Drago and that Vikto Drago will fight against Adonis."
" Easily one of my top ten movies of all time!
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,10,"This movie brings explosive excitement into the ring, with emotional, hard-hitting drama that explores the continuation of the Rocky saga, with a new protagonist: Creed. The movie is joyfully worth the watch, and shows the dark times of the son of the now-deceased Apollo Creed:From his time in a detention facility as a young kid, to a young man who lives up to his father's potential at the end of the match, Adonis Creed tries to find a name for himself in the world. The movie delivers specatacular emotion, when Rocky falls ill, Creed has to get back up and fight for Rocky's life. As he plows his was to fight for his name, he has to balance to fight for his father's rival-turned friend. It's movie especially keeps up the hype from the first-to-last minute of the movie. It is able to continue the Rocky evolution with a fresh-new take, bringing you the BEST motivational scene in cinema history. Also packed with emotional moments, CREED continues the Rocky Saga at a 10/10 rating.It IS one of my top ten movies of all time, and pleases fans and audiences everywhere.CREED... is never to be missed! Fight To Watch This Movie! Fight For Your Name!"
" Powerful and entertaining
",2018-07-16 00:00:00,10,"I am NOT a boxing person. I have never watched a Rocky movie. I honestly don't care about sports. I came for Ryan Coogler and I was not disappointed. This movie is gripping, the visuals are spectacular, and each performance is so committed. If you're a Rocky fan, like my dad who I saw this with, you will probably like it, but if you think you need to watch six movies before this one to get it, you don't!! It stands on its own and it's great."
" Standard but okay
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,6,"Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) is a young black man from Los Angeles and has aspirations to be a boxer. He moves to Philadelphia to seek help from Rocky Balboa as played by Sylvester Stallone who reprises his famous role yet again.The introduction to Adonis as a child is rather fascinating when a mysterious maternal figure appears in his life. The identity of his connection with the woman is revealed later as is his connection with Rocky. These revelations are intriguing as are the fates the viewer gradually learns of other characters in the early ""Rocky"" films.At the start of the film, there are many good reasons given to discourage Adonis from boxing. This is just the obligatory attempt to appear cautious and concerned. Then, the movie rips right into glorifying the sport.Overall, the movie has good elements. There are energetic scenes and the acting is fine. Stallone's presence and charm add greatly to the film although the recent batch of awards does seem like over-praise.The trouble is that the movie seems to follow the formula of the many standard boxing movies before it. The mandatory romance could be foreseen within milliseconds. (In fairness, the love interest has an interesting story of her own. The movie would have benefited with more emphasis on it.) And the training scenes, while finely edited, seem endless - mainly because we've seen them before in many other movies.""Creed"" pays a nice sentimental tribute to the original ""Rocky"" film while introducing younger talent. It would have benefited more from a story with more surprises."
" It's Good as Its Own Film - But Makes a Fine Addition to the Rocky Legacy
",2018-06-29 00:00:00,10,"Creed was the film I was sceptical of for such a long time. I could have watched it thirty times over in the amount of time I spent building up to watch it. Then, I finally did. I thought at first it was going okay. I knew this wasn't going to be my favourite Rocky (related) film, but there was every chance it could be second or third. Course, there was every chance it could have been my least favourite and I ended up giving it a 5/10, but that didn't happen. Halfway through the film, say around the second Act, I remember slouching just a little. I liked what I was seeing but some things were missing. First of all, I still find it hard to watch Rocky on-screen as an old man. I'm just so used to and have always been used to watching the first five, when he was much younger, you know. Obviously there's a five year filmmaking jump between IV and V, but still. The end of the film approached and the credits appeared themselves. What I had just watched wasn't my favourite Rocky movie, but could have been the best-made/most well-made of the Rocky films. And if you're like me you'd say the other was the very first Rocky. The cinematography and fight choreography are fantastic and so is the directing and acting. Stallone does give a fantastic performance, co-star or not. It doesn't feel out of place that Stallone is the second main star of the film, cuz A: Jordan gives a great performance himself and B: even being cast as the movie's co-star, Rocky is in almost every part of the film. Like he isn't seen until around 10-15 minutes in, but still, he's there all the time and it's brilliant. The film's antagonist is decent enough, albeit nowhere near as memorable as the likes of, say, Ivan Drago or Clubber Lang. Or even Apollo Creed. They're just the greatest, you know. Although the two awesome things here are 1) It's so cool knowing it's actually the son of Apollo Creed who's the star, and 2) Well, the antagonist of the second film is Ivan Drago's son, and apparently Drago is in it himself.Some things irk me a lot. Why does Rocky gotta have cancer in the film? It makes me sad cuz I don't want anything to happen to him in the next film. He's one of the best movie characters of all time. And I don't like the fact that Creed loses. They made Rocky lose in the first Rocky, and in Rocky Balboa. I know he lost in Rocky III too but he later won. Why make Creed also lose? He should win in the first two and if they make a third one, let him go out as one who's been defeated but make it a great match. Solid movie either way. 9.5/10edit-07/03/2018: After watching it another time, it's definitely obtaining the 10/10 score, particularly thanks to its cinematography, fight choreography, dialogue, acting and direction. The more I see it, the more I like it, it seems. I also strongly believe this film showcases Michael B. Jordan's best performance. His return is definitely long-awaited. 10/10."
" Boring. So boring.
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,4,Slept through it all. It's full of dialogues. Just talk talk talk... nothing original or unpredictable. Long and boring.
" Fantastic
",2018-06-20 00:00:00,10,Creed is a fantastic movie. One of the best Stallone performances in a long time. The story was just as good as the acting it may have a weak villain but all the other characters are just fantastic I love this movie and I can't wait for the sequel!
" Nice sequel
",2018-06-18 00:00:00,7,"I loved the idea, I loved the story and I loved every single scene with Sylvester Stallone aka Rocky Balboa. It was nice. So why only 7 stars? The main character just doesn't have enough charisma to really entertain an audience until the end, especially when we all know how it will end anyways. That never bothered me watching Rocky. Who can be bored seeing the underdog fighting his way up? But here it didn't work that well. Maybe the whole setting was at fault too. Everything was hip and shiny, the girl was pretty and cute, the drama was a bit cheesy. I miss the 80s feel I guess. I miss the rawness. But you cannot bring that back, I know."
" Metascore 8 ????? !!!
",2018-06-10 00:00:00,1,"I dont even know where to start. This movie is awful. No acting, an story that you probably seen millions of time. No great direction. The only thing that was well done was the screenplay. 
Full of melo-drama a la Hollywood. No great music ... I mean WHAT WAS GOOD IN THIS MOVIE? 
How in the world is Metascore giving 8 Points for it ??!?!?! Jesus Christ! This is not the first time i saw a very suspicious Metascore rating... What is going on?If you havent seen like more than 10 movies in your life im sure you will enjoy this one... but you have seen more... please dont waste your time like i did."

Creed and rocky haves very similar story structure, both character have a big dream and the same goal, but it's the motivation that differs from two of them. Creed the name, that is the main reason why he fights, and rocky trains him because of this name, seeking shadows from the past. Two characters have great chemistry together, they learn from each other, they fight with each other, that seperates this film and rocky, in rocky it's a one man show, a big idiot had nothing but a dream, got lucky find his biggest opportunity of his life, not only proving the world that he is great, but at the same time proving to himself that he is not a loser. Compare to this film, two characters looking at complete opposite directions, creed is taking his name to the future wish not to ruin his old mans legacy, but rocky is looking at his past, he is the only one left on this world, the kid is his only connection to the past. Both character are alone. 
All I want to say is this film is amazing."
" A single great payoff
",2018-05-14 00:00:00,7,"From the Rocky series, this definitely did something with it, create another awesome boxing movie but with SYLVESTER STALLONE as a mentor. It worked perfectly scene by scene to see how it would work out.Ryan Coogler definitely did a boxing spectacle right here. Showing a theme of struggle and training to result in a good end. But nothing really super-creative about. Colors just felt like silver and black. This could've done better, but it's done enough."
" Awesome
",2018-04-21 00:00:00,10,This movie got me so expired that I punched a wall and broke two fingers!
" Awful!
",2018-03-31 00:00:00,1,"This is the worst movie about boxing! Ever! So predictable and boring. I almost slept during the movie projection at the cinema. Son of Apollo Creed, Adonis (what a name!), is self-taught fighter, fights occasionally in Mexico with some losers and win those fights. Soon after that he knocks-down a 6th fighter in the world in the gym! Fighter no.6 knocked-down by unexperienced fighter who was never trained by trainer. Un-be-li-ev-ab-le! What a cliche! What came out of Hollywood movies? Who gave to this disaster so high ranking? Nominations?! Awards?! Nothing than a shameless fraud!"
" One step. One punch. One round at a time.
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,8,"May contain plot spoilers if you haven't figured out the entire plot from the title and poster.Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) is the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed who died while mom was pregnant. He has climbed the corporate ladder but feels incomplete because he is not a boxer. Not being able to secure a trainer in LA, he travels to Philadelphia where a reluctant Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) trains him and he also gets a love interest (Tessa Thompson). At this point the plot becomes more inane as it simply repeats the first film with different characters, if fact I was expecting to hear, ""Cut me Mick"" it was so grossly similar. Oh wait. It was Light Heavyweight, so I guess it was different.I can't imagine this film catching on to a sequel, but then again I never imagined Hellraiser going into outer space either. I was disappointed primarily in the trite formula script. They even reused the sound track which was the best aspect of the film. I left the theater feeling, been there, done that, got the t-shirt several times over.Now having said that, the acting was great. The plot was fan fiction quality. 3 1/2 starsGuide: 1 quick F-bomb. No sex or nudity."

" A Worthy Spinoff
",2018-03-16 00:00:00,8,"I shied away from this movie for--I guess--a couple of years now. I'll tell you why: because nothing bothers me more, cinematically, than famed and glorious movie that has a horrible sequel. The Rocky franchise is spectacular (with the exception of Rocky V, we'll pretend that never happened). I was so afraid of Creed being this pock mark right on the beautiful face of Rocky. But I'd heard good things. Then I saw Black Panther, which is by the same director (Ryan Coogler), and I thought, ""I think I'll check out Creed.""I'm so glad I did. First of all the story was good. Apollo Creed had a son by another woman and his widow took in that kid and raised him like her own. Even though he had a good upbringing his true passion was to fight. He wanted to fight like his father and be trained by Rocky Balboa without using his father's name--which was it's own struggle. He goes through peaks and valleys in his quest to be a real boxer and it's all essential for the story to be good.The second thing that impressed me was Sylvester Stallone playing the aged and retired Rocky Balboa. He was superb in his more subdued and sage-like role. He's no longer the young and fit fighter; he's now an old man lovingly referred to as uncle by a young prodigy that he wants to see succeed. It was such a great performance. I've never seen Sly be anything other than the macho action hero (with the exception of Oscar). To see him be this mellow enlightened character that wasn't forced or satirical was awesome. In his language and manner of speaking he was still Rocky Balboa: a Philly street guy that knew how to fight, but in his behavior and handling of Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) he was like Yoda. I was mesmerized.We must remember though that this is Creed, a sequel or spinoff from Rocky, so boxing is the key. Not just simply boxing, but boxing as a heavy underdog. We had that of course and I don't think you'd be disappointed. It can never be as good as the original but it was certainly a worthy follow up."
" Good start... to a new series?
",2018-02-28 00:00:00,8,"Firstly, (coming from a huge Rocky fan) this film does a great job at easing old and new fans back into the ""Rocky"" franchise. Michael B. Jordan does a great job as Adonis Creed and I also really liked Tessa Thompson's character Bianca... Knowing that we will be getting a ""Creed 2"" is really exciting and I am sure we will get great performances from Adonis Creed and Bianca again.The fights in this movie were really good. The camera shots and sound effects were fantastic. My one big flaw in this movie however, is that Creed's opponent in the final fight was a little underwhelming. By no means did he seem nearly as intimidating as the opponents that Rocky fought in the first four movies. I think that was a lot of missed potential and the climax wasn't as good because of it. Training scenes? Not as classic as the first few Rocky movies, but they were still decent in this movie.Overall, good movie and a good start to a potential new series of movies. I'm hoping for at least a couple more Creed films and it's good to know we'll at least get one more."
" Rocky Told in Present Day
",2018-02-28 00:00:00,6,"Its a good movie, but if you've seen Rocky, you've seen Creed."
" Great Movie! Better acting than the originals
",2018-02-26 00:00:00,9,Some of the best acting os Sylvester's life. Really a well done movie. I liked how it wasn't just natural talent that allowed Donnie to succeed but he needed the support of others and hardworking to achieve his goals. Great movie
" Well, At Least Sylvester Came Back
",2018-02-22 00:00:00,4,"I have never watched any of the previous Rocky films. Naturally, I have heard of them and Creed in particular. I was always intrigued about this movie due to the overwhelming hype it received from critics. So on a whim late one night, I happened to catch this film on HBO. I found myself neither impressed nor disappointed with Creed. It's an average sports drama that had no reason to be made, besides cashing in on 80s nostalgia. 
Pros:
 Michael B Jordan and Tessa Thompson have good on-screen chemistry.
Sylvester Stallone does decent playing Rocky despite having little to work with.
Technical aspects of this movie are fine.
Michael B Jordan excels in his fight scenes. 
Michael and Sylvester do have some chemistry. 
Cons:
The plot. It takes a while to build up to the climax of this movie(the fight scene with Ricky) and after we get to the climax, the movie pretty much dies. There isn't a lot of tension or exposition given. The movie starts with Donnie being locked up in Juvie and jumps directly to modern times. For a two hour plus movie, they had enough time to give a little more exposition. Everything we learn about Donnie is told to us and hardly shown. The story is insanely cliche and predictable. 30 minutes in and you already have an impression of how it's going to end. By the time I got to the ending, I just felt numb and not as inspired as the film wanted me to be. Not only does Donnie fail to make a name for himself at the end but then we get a ripoff ""Rocky Stair-steps"" scene."
" Solid
",2018-01-25 00:00:00,7,"Sylvester Stallone returns as Rocky Balboa in this seventh installment of the Rocky franchise. Taking place sometime after the events of Rocky Balboa, the movie focuses on the character of Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan), the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), Rocky's original ultimate foe. Adonis is trying to become a boxer just like his father and recruits Rocky as a trainer in the ultimate bid for championship.Creed is an excellent example on how being formulaic is not necessarily a bad thing. The story in this film is textbook perfect sports film story. It's quintessentially Rocky in a way that's so blatant as to be utterly charming. And it works. The director, the screenwriter, the actors, they all believe in this story, in this franchise, and it shows in their work. Rocky has always been all about heart and it warms me to see a film such as this being made in modern times. It tells me that people still believe in the right things.I also like that they didn't try to reboot the series with Adonis. He is not meant to replace Rocky. Including this one, there have been seven Rocky movies so far, and they have built their own mythos, their own unique character cast. The story of Adonis builds on top of Rocky and Apollo, but it remains its own things.What can I say, it's a great movie and worthy of the name of Rocky."
" Fantastic Fight Filming
",2018-01-23 00:00:00,8,The DP on this should get every reward forever. Its a good movie. Exciting to watch.
" Better than I expected
",2018-01-16 00:00:00,8,"It was undeniably a good film, the boxing stats that appeared with every new boxer on screen was a nice idea although it did become a bit too much of a fighter movie for my tastes.
I think the idea of following Apollos son and getting an elderly Rocky to train him was good as it built on the friendship and loyalty between Rocky and Apollo, but I don't like what they've done to Rocky; a fighter and believer has suddenly turned into a cynical old man, not even bothered to fight his own illness (yes the death of Paulie and Adrian, his only family we ever saw, would have messed him up in the head but it seemed unlike the Rocky we knew)
And the idea of an illegitimate son just besmirched the memory of a favourite character from four films, yes they needed a link to Apollo but couldn't they have found another way??The storyline was similar really to the original Rocky film, except instead of a nobody given a shot it was an up-and-comer.
And it can be argued that Rocky almost took the role of Mickey.As I said it was a good film and I do hope they make sequel, but maybe lighten up on Rocky's character"
" Creed (2015): An Amazing 7th Installment in the ROCKY Saga
",2018-01-10 00:00:00,10,"Creed is an American sports drama film starring Sylvester Stallone, Michael B. Jordan, Tessa Thompson, Phylicia Rashad, and Anthony Bellew. The film is written by and directed by Ryan Coogler. Creed is a spectacular film with excellent performances, especially with Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone. Ryan Coogler does an amazing job directing the film, showing the modern side of Philadephia and how much the scenery has changed since the original ROCKY (1976). Creed, much like the orginal ROCKY, ROCKY II (1979), and the previously released ROCKY BALBOA (2006), deals with a ton of drama and Creed captivates and touches all the emotions in every right way possible. Creed had a budget of $40,000,000 and grossed $173,600,000 worldwide. Sylvester Stallone won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor in Creed. He was also nominated for an Academy Award for the same role as Rocky Balboa in Creed. He really should have won that Oscar.Creed is a perfect film. It is everything I never expected this film to be. 10/10. A great film and maybe in another 10 years this movie will be a classic. Highly Recommended, especially for the ROCKY fans."
" This Movie Is Genius!
",2018-01-07 00:00:00,10,"I highly recommend this movie, I know I'm extremely late on reviewing this movie, but I highly recommend buying or downloading or whatever you would do to get this movie. I think it had a very amazing story. A very amazing cast. And many historic actors and actresses. I especially loved seeing the actor that played Rocky in it, and thought that he bring the story together veery well!"
" Predictable and weak entry
",2018-01-05 00:00:00,2,"So many things wrong with this film. Misplaced casting, with every fighter in the film besides the main character (Michael Jordan's Adonis Creed) looks like a fighter but our guy looks he's more apt to be seen stuck behind a desk in a cubicle, and while he's in shape, he's obviously not prepared for the role and obtained a fighter's physique. Something Stallone did like crazy back in the day, and had a reputation for. The story is pretty weak, with Adonis wanting to make his own name but then after getting his ass beat in a local gym by a real pro, he sucks up immediately to Rocky Balboa, trading on his dad's friendship with Rocky to get some training. So most of the film makes little sense with Adonis trying to hide this at all. Also, I don't care who you are, but giving up what appears to be a lavish lifestyle living in a giant mansion with plenty of opportunities to succeed in life, including endless funds for a private boxing trainer and ring, you go seeking out a retired champion who doesn't even actively train anybody? Come on. Stallone does well in this movie, but it's largely because for the first time in a long while, he's not playing an over the top character. He's depicted as just owning his wife's restaurant and living a pretty modest life, with some indicators that Paulie was living with him up until a few years prior to the events in the film, which is odd considering the history the two characters had. He is depicted as being diagnosed with cancer which provides for some limited emotional moments, but the film quickly forgets about this in favor of the ending fight debacle. Michael Jordan's acting is also just lacking any charisma. He succeeds mostly in the film through his interactions with a girlfriend he acquires, and the two have some on screen chemistry, but beyond that he's just some guy, and lacks anything about him that really stands out. His boxing motivation is very weak and he never comes across as really wanting anything very much, and even his apparent willingness to get into fights are constantly strained overacting, especially given his lack of apparent boxer mentality. He again is just seriously miscast. The fight scenes in the films are also just beyond realistic. In every one of the fights, Adonis gets big hits landed on him repeatedly, something no boxer can really survive more than one or two of. Yes, the original Rocky films showed an excess of this, but this is 2017 and other fighting films have set the standard for how a fight should be depicted today, and this film just gets it all wrong. Other problems are that the actor Michael Jordan also just (again) didn't really get much training for the role as a boxer, and there's repetitive slip ups with his fighting stance and actions in the ring, whereas his opponents appear to be very disciplined about it, likely being real boxers or at least having taken their roles more seriously. The final fight in the film tries too hard to be a repeat of what we saw in the first Rocky, and results in a pretty weak ending. He doesn't win the fight, and by any scorecard, lost it badly despite not being knocked out."
" More remake than sequel...and it works
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,8,"Tis the season for sequels that are actually remakes. I will admit that I rolled my eyes when this one was announced, but somehow Coogler and Jordan (especially the latter) made it an actual film...a worthy successor to Rocky I & II. Yeah, it was a Rocky movie, but it was a good Rocky movie. Nobody's said that for a LONG time."
" Terrific boxing film.
",2017-12-19 00:00:00,9,"This is the best gift a Rocky fan could get, the film has got it all: solid plot, exelently developped characters, technically good and it's very motivational.
The story is clear, captivating, and all of its phases are well connected, plus the filmmakers did a pretty good job linking the movie with its predecessors, in a well manered way, keeping these linkings in their right place, assuring that they don't be very exagerated and not messing with our main movie's image and plot.
The actors made a great performance too, Michael B. Jordan and Tessa Thompson; two good young actors with a bright future, and old ""Rocky"" Sylvester Stallone retreiving the role that made his career but in a very different situation, fighting in another battle and making difficult choices, a great performance from a very loved actor but with very underrated acting skills, for which he merited the oscar nomination.
Another point in which the movie succeded, it is the editing. This movie has got the best fighting in a ring scenes ever, brilliantly shot and edited, plus, it is the first boxing film that I've seen that focuses on what happens between boxers off the ring, during press conferences and TV reports/interviews.
What other can you wait for from a film like this?"
" Nice boxing movie.
",2017-11-12 00:00:00,8,"The Rocky sage continues in the Creed series. I grew up with the Rocky movies. We Always watched them between Christmas and New Year. Watching the life of Rocky Balboa winning every fight he had in life. Watching Stallone's struggle of his own in life. Seeing Rocky and Stallone at this age in the movie Creed is magnificent. Who knew.Stallone puts this ""Micky""-like fragile trainer and he did it well. The beautiful Phylicia Rashad gave us a small performance, but I was glad to see her. After the Cosby she went off the radar for me. So it was a nice surprise.As a Rocky movie this one is, sadly to say, a little bit modern. It's not the old school hero versus bad guy like Samuel Jackson explained how a hero and a villain has to be, when he was Mr. Glass in the movie unbreakable. But when you remember Rocky fighting Drago, the one who killed Creed sr. you know what I mean.That being said, I am looking forward to Creed 2, where Don is going to revenge his father's death by fighting Drago. For me, the Rocky saga is still on! Great movie, thank you for not bringing in too much rap music."
" Worthy successor to the Rocky franchise is true to the original
",2017-10-29 00:00:00,8,"A fine successor to the Rocky franchise follows the son of Rocky Balboa's original opponent, Apollo Creed. The film opens with the young Creed, the illegitimate son of his boxer father, as a juvenile delinquent, but who is adopted by Apollo's widow (remember, the big Russian in ""Rocky IV"" killed him). Picking up years later, Creed has a promising white collar career, but he continues to fight in underground Mexican boxing matches, as well as fighting his own demons to escape his father's shadow and find his own identity. He decides to quit his job and follow in his father's footsteps to become a boxer, fighting under the name Johnson instead of Creed and enlists the help of none other than Rocky Balboa to train him. The young Creed gets his big shot when it leaks out who his father is and when the champ, ""Pretty"" Ricky Conlon, is looking for a last minute opponent, just as Creed senior did for Rocky in the original film. The film follows the Rocky underdog formula, with a terrific Michael B. Jordan as the young Adonis Creed having the prove himself to the world and to himself as well. Jordan makes Creed feel like a genuine person and not one of the many cartoon characters who populated later Rocky films (""Rocky Balboa"" being the exception). This film differs from prior Rocky films in that Balboa is now a supporting character, but Stallone delivers a heartfelt performance that is his best since the original film. Also, this is the first Rocky film not written by Stallone, but the story's underdog nature, the father/son relationship, and, of course, the build-up to the big fight, all fit nicely within the Rocky formula. Directed and co-written by Ryan Coogler, he brings an indie film sensibility to a major studio film to great effect. Overall, ""Creed"" hearkens back to the heart and soul of the original ""Rocky"" in what I hope continues for the sequel now in production. Interesting factoid: Stallone is now the same age as Burgess Meredith when he played Mickey in the original film."
" A Classic, Rocky shines again
",2017-10-20 00:00:00,8,"I am a big fan of Sylvester Stallone, and having seen him get old made me upset and afraid of his not doing any more ""boxing"" movies like the old classics. Guess I was wrong, I watched this movie back in the theater and this is the second time. It is what I needed, good cast, and with Sylvester Stallone, there is no way in hell I would dislike this movie. I loved it. Although when you come think of it, it isn't a real big deal for people who aren't big fans of Sylvester Stallone like I am. Suppose it's just me.8/10"
" ""Rocky: The final chapter"", filled with emotions and memories...
",2017-10-19 00:00:00,9,"Try seeing this film as the last chapter of a biography. The last and biggest ""fight"" of Rocky, whose companion is a young man, a young boxer for all of us, but an old friend for him. An old friend (Apollo) to whom he still owes and has to perform a final good deed in order to get even.To some, this film might seem predictable. And at times it might be, but it keeps doing well what it should do, by constantly stirring up emotions and building characters.Especially for the Rocky franchise fans, this film is the kind of a farewell that you would expect from the ""Italian Stallion"". A tough and fighting goodbye, ending on a high note through all the hard times, the same way as all of the films prior to this did."
" I was wrong about this, which is good
",2017-09-30 00:00:00,9,"When I first heard about this film, I thought, ""Why can't they leave the Rocky franchise alone?"" My expectations of Creed were low, I believed it wouldn't be any good and would be a bad tribute to Rocky. However all that changed when I actually watched it, the story was captivating, Sylvester Stallone was back to his best as the character we've all come to love all be it in a supporting role, Michael B Jordan was outstanding as Adonis Creed who feels he has to follow in his late father's footsteps in the sport of boxing. A real surprise were the boxers who were in the movie, particularly Andre Ward and Tony Bellew and how well they did in their roles considering they're not actors, they both give terrifying performances, but they're not necessarily villains just because they're opponents for the protagonist. The boxing scenes did the Rocky franchise proud and were authentic thanks to the use of the HBO announcers, particularly the final bout which starts off as the mis-match it was on paper but almost ends in an upset and at the end, which was realistic, there was not a dry eye in the house. All in all Creed is a movie worthy of being in the Rocky franchise and is a great movie in its own right."
" Remake of Rocky without compelling protagonist/antagonist
",2017-09-09 00:00:00,4,"I guess they had to try a new way to reinvigorate the Rocky franchise, so they basically rewrite the original screenplay, but the down on his luck boxer is Apollo Creed's son. Who the ""Apollo Creed"" is supposed to be in the new movie, I don't remember, because the antagonist (and plot in general) is so forgettable.Also funny how they re-use the anticlimactic ending from Rocky 1, but without a compelling protagonist and completely forgettable boxing matches, the ending falls as flat as the rest of the film.The thing I did think was slightly clever was the ""titles"" they'd put over the boxers Creed was fighting. Was a bit videogamey, but they were so forgettable otherwise, it definitely didn't hurt.Stalone was great. Without him, this movie would have been an absolute clunker and had absolutely no dramatic tension or plot."
" A lesser spin-off, but still worthwhile
",2017-09-08 00:00:00,6,"CREED is a spin-off from the ROCKY franchise, bringing in fresh blood and taking it in a new direction. It feels a little like a remake of the first ROCKY movie, with Sylvester Stallone now playing the role of the aged trainer who helps a newcomer in the form of Michael B. Jordan to train for a title fight against a Liverpudlian boxer (!). The twist is that Jordan's playing Adonis Johnson, the son of the much-missed Apollo Creed who met his maker in ROCKY III.The main problem I had with this movie is its familiarity. It's like ROCKY but simply isn't as good. Jordan tries hard but as written his character isn't as endearing as Stallone's, and the use of a hip hop soundtrack wasn't to my taste either. The good news is that Stallone gives a typically fine performance for his part, good enough to be Oscar nominated for it. In addition, the boxing scenes are filmed with a new kind of special camera which adds a real fluidity and force to them."
" Solid boxing movie
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,7,"Not too long ago I watched Rocky Balboa. While I don't think it's awful, there was a certain clumsiness to it that made it feel already very dated.This movie is a lot more graceful with its execution and it earns the more emotional scenes. Michael B. Jordan puts in a really strong performance that holds the movie together. His relationship with Stallone's character really had to work to to pull off this movie and they do a great job. The romantic aspect to Jordan's character didn't work as well. Tessa Thompson hold her own but for a movie that's over 2 hours long their courtship felt rushed. I did appreciate them fleshing out her character and giving her her own career aspirations.The actual boxing was a mixed bag. His first fight I loved how it was shot as to look like one continuous take with the camera floating around the boxers. The final match I didn't enjoy. It's very rushed and some of the rounds are reduced to a montage. It seemed like they wanted to sprint to the end for an emotional payoff rather than really showing the match. Southpaw for example is not as good of a movie but the boxing matches felt a lot more real and less like goofy slugfests.I'm not sure if the director was intending to start a new franchise with Creed but I think he did make a movie far better than the later Rocky sequels. I'd be fine with following this character in another movie if the writing is as good as this one."
" Excellent and moving film.
",2017-07-11 00:00:00,9,"I heard many poor reviews from friends who had seen this before me, so my expectations were low. I have to say, I very much enjoyed this!Michael B. Jordan was a sheer joy to watch, and is one to keep your eye on as a future A-lister. His performance was more than convincing and the chemistry between him and Sylvester Stallone was perfect. Oh and Sly, it was great to see him in the franchise that made him famous.Ignore the reviews and watch this film with an open mind... the story is great as is the directing.It's a 9/10 from me!"
" creed 2
",2017-07-06 00:00:00,8,I have been searching and searching for weeks now about when is creed 2 etc going to happen and who will be in it.As from today it seems that Stallone is showing hints that IVAN DRAGO will be in creed 2 is there any one out know this is correct?I was disappointed with Creed 1 Because there was so many ideas that could of made the movie excellent and to have Drago back it would make the movie so much betterAny ideas folks??
" It was awesome to be honest.
",2017-07-04 00:00:00,9,"Creed movie review By Jenson MooreThe movie Creed is all about a young boy whose dad is Apollo creed and he died in the ring before he was born. He had a lot of fights which led him to get put in ""juvie"" and also he has lots of fights in ""juvie"" as well then soon after a woman comes to ""juvie"" and takes creed home and a couple of years later he gets a job and then gets a promotion but he quits his job to be a full time boxer like his dad Apollo. He doesn't have any luck in the first matches in the training place so he decides to go see Rocky balboa and he teaches creed everything that he knows and soon after creed is 16-0 because of Rocky Balboa and then a while after he has a match against Ricky Conlan. Can he win?"
" Only the fight scenes are entertaining.
",2017-06-18 00:00:00,3,"The boxing scenes in the ring are the only entertaining parts of this movie, the plot is slow-paced and boring, and the love interest aspect is annoying, why can't there just be male and female friendships only, in films for once. Speaking of the girlfriend, she is absolutely crazy playing her music full blast in the middle of the night when she is literally half deaf and on top of that she performs her music in an extremely loud club, these are the actions of a mentally unstable person.The scenery is not all that, but it isn't supposed to be, it's gritty and it suits the movie, the cinematic colour design is also quite dark and suits the gritty scenery.The performances are fine, it is just a very long movie, and if a film isn't exciting or entertaining then it will simply bore the majority of the viewers.Creed would've been better chopped down to an hour and a half.You're better off watching the Movie Clips of this film on YouTube."
" Pretty much a knock out.
",2017-06-01 00:00:00,8,"""If I could give up everything to buy one more day with my wife, I would.""This line really stuck with me. It may be the most earnest thing that Stallone has said in a movie in (at least) twenty years.Creed is the kind of idea that you would think would never get made. It loosely hinges on the Rocky franchise by telling the story of Apollo Creed's son, who finds a trainer in none other than Rocky Balboa. Rocky is the one role that Stallone was born to play. He elevates the movie significantly, but he is not the star. Much of the films dramatic weight rests on the shoulders of Michael B. Jordan, and fortunately he carries it with pride.Creed breaks from the tradition of previous sports movies. It has a happy ending, but not the one that you saw coming. The film puts realism before gimmick every step of the way, making it worthy of praise."
" Horrible and boring
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,1,"I can't write a spoiler, because I couldn't watch it all the way through. The dialog between Thompson and Jordan is painful, awkward, and stilted. Perhaps they can both act, but they don't show it here. It's like watching a brother and sister pretending they're on a date. Perhaps it's the script, which is frankly boring.Too bad, the story line is fine (as far as any Hollywood story can be), but it's poorly served by the numerous (*too* numerous) scenes between Jordan and Thompson."
" A sequel that devolves into nothing more than a useless reboot
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,5,"Many people will probably watch this movie just to follow the evolution of Sylvester Stallone. It is a pleasure to see Stallone grow as an actor with his age.Having said that, this movie is nothing more than a weak remake, with Michael B. Jordan replacing Rocky. The fact that he is a ""Creed"", adds nothing to the story, just as much as Jordan doesn't add anything to the character.It's exploitation of a unique icon, that was shining in the 70's, brilliant in its simplicity, and now it's copied without a character. As enjoyable as it MIGHT have been as a stand alone movie for the new generation, it's a letdown for people who actually know the character that should've stopped after Balboa (part 6!!!!!)."

" Ryan Coogler does it again
",2017-03-08 00:00:00,9,"I saw Fruitvale Station in theaters, and I remember how it made me feel even to this day. Ryan Coogler (with the help of Michael B. Jordan) pulled it off again.I cannot recall, from the top of my head, a sports film that was better directed than Creed. The boxing scenes build tension wonderfully, especially the last match, and the training sequences had me so excited for the ensuing fights. Other than those elements, Coogler added little things here and there that make Creed so special. For instance, the scene where Coogler pulls the camera away from Bianca (Tessa Thompson) and Adonis (Michael B. Jordan) and she explains to him, what the word ""jawn"" means. It is things like this and the shots of Philadelphia that make the film feel so much more authentic (including the inclusion of Meek Mill's music during a training montage). I absolutely cannot wait to see what Coogler does with Black Panther."
" Drag and too dramatic
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,4,"I am a big fan of Rocky series.. like wise all action movies. This movie was a big drag, and was trying to pull Rocky out nothing. I have seen much better movies which keep you on your toes, Michael B. Jordan is OK, most of them praised for his skills and i would say he did his best. Ryan Coogler could do much better job on story and direction. Sound track helps movies like this if it had a effective sound and great timing. Look at actually Rocky, one of most important factor was its sound track which gave goose bumps.Well to my own conclusion.. its waste of time."
" It's Not ""Rocky VII""...And That's Not A Bad Thing
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,9,"In 2006, Sylvester Stallone seemingly put the final coda on the Rocky series with ""Rocky Balboa"", a very inspirational film that may have been the best of the entire franchise. As such, when the rumors began circulating about a project to quasi-revive that Rocky universe in a film about the son of Apollo Creed, they were met with laughter (at best) and downright derision (at worst). With the touching way that Stallone left the franchise in ""Balboa"", why did we need something else? Would anyone care about Apollo's son? Stallone would not be lending his writing talents to the project, and a young director (Ryan Coogler) would be stepping behind the camera.To be completely honest, I had very little hopes for this film. I wondered why I would care, and I wondered if this was the right story to tell. Fortunately, I was proved wrong in pretty much every aspect, as this turns into a wonderful film that seemingly does the impossible: have Stallone's Rocky character in a movie that isn't primarily about him.For a basic plot summary, ""Creed"" tells the story of Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan), the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed. Raised by Apollo's wife Mary Anne (Phylicia Rashad), Adonis seems to be on the right track after a rough beginning in foster care. He has a comfortable job and even just got promoted. On the side, though, Adonis is boxing in some sketchy joints in Mexico, where his success convinces him to quit the day job and go professional like his father (a relationship which has been kept under wraps...Adonis goes by the last name Johnson). He quickly discovers, however, that he's going to need to get a lot tougher to compete in the professional ranks. As such, he leaves his California hometown and travels across the country to Philadelphia, where he seeks out Rocky (Stallone) to try and convince him to become his trainer.The key thing to understand about this movie is that you can't look at it as ""Rocky VII"". During my first viewing in the theater, I kept waiting for that trumpet theme to kick in or maybe a training montage to ""Gonna Fly Now"". That's not the style of this movie, though. If anything, it is more of a modernized version of the original ""Rocky"", with Adonis as the hungry up-and-coming and Rocky as the Mick-like trainer figure. It is set in modern Philly and has a very urban feel to the proceedings. Originally, I was disappointed in this style, but the more I thought about it and read other opinions, the more I began to understand that this was the way that movie had to be made. Though I identify with the original ""Rocky"" more than this film, I'm sure ""Creed"" is a more modern inspiration to people in the same vein.I think the hallmark of this film is probably it's incredible acting by all involved. Jordan is more than capable as the young Adonis (as I knew he would be from his work in other roles), while Stallone again proves that he understands the Rocky character more than any other role he's ever played. It must have been difficult for Sly to keep himself at a distance (not writing/directing) and let someone else ""tell him how to be Rocky"", but I think it pays off here in that both the classic and the modern come together almost perfectly. Had Stallone been more actively involved, the project may not have had that ""modern grit"" that it was going for.The main reason I can't give this a full five stars is because for all the good things the film does, it struggles a bit in the early goings in developing the Adonis character. It seems like a few plot lines aren't followed up on as well as they should be (perhaps in favor of showcasing ""Philly culture"" a bit too much), and it took me longer than what I'm sure the film-makers would have intended in order for me to really start getting emotionally attached to the character. The scenes with Rocky had no trouble doing that (because of the history of the character), but it just takes a bit too long for Adonis.Overall, though, I think one has to consider ""Creed"" a rousing success. Despite a few shortcomings in plotting and character development, it manages to tell a compelling story while inter-weaving it with the history of the Rocky Balboa character and its franchise. Stallone could easily be up for some hardware for his generational performance, while Jordan has now cemented himself on the fast track to Hollywood success. Whether you have seen all the Rocky films multiple times or haven't seen a single one once, ""Creed"" will have something to pull you in."
" Blistering
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,8,"I'm a huge Stallone fan, he's an misunderstood genius, and it's great to see him back as Rocky, and noble of him to pass on the starring role to Michael B. Jordan and directing duties to Ryan Coogler who was just 29 when the film was released. Creed is a blistering movie and it gets my 8/10. The characters are excellent, Rocky is at his humble best, Bianca is a credible, street-savvy girlfriend. Tony Bellew as Pretty Ricky Conlan is a superb, intense actor, I'm surprised he's not been in more stuff. Initially I thought Tony Bellew isn't menacing enough as the main opponent but then I saw how giving him a subtle nice-guy quality makes him more engaging and not just a cipher like how Drago from Rocky IV was just a cipher. It's a nice touch when he congratulates Adonis after the fight and informs him that he will be the future champ. Graham McTavish as Conlan's manager is excellent as always, I loved him in Rambo (2008), I think he'd make a great future Bond villain. Tessa Thompson's stage routines as Bianca are very nicely choreographed and provide a sensual contrast to the manly boxing scenes. Other stand- out performances include London actor Ritchi Coaster playing local boxing coach Pete Sporino. Initially I felt Michael B. Jordan in the title role didn't have enough attitude to play this iconic character. He seems to jump from a sadistic, violent child in the correctional facility to a mild-mannered investment broker or whatever that job is supposed to be. Prior to watching the film I was expecting the son of Apollo Creed to be the ultimate badass and I was expecting the film to be an epic emotional journey of how a broken child discovers his roots, finds his path, beats the odds and becomes a hero of the people. We kind of got that, just the safe, predictable, watered-down 2015 version of it. Gimme the 1976 version any day! As the film progressed I adjusted to the unexpected soft tone and became drawn- in by Jordan's emotive, considered performance, however Dolph Lundgren or Mr. T would have woken me up a bit!Ryan Coogler's direction is reliable and by-the-book. The tone is always well measured and great attention is paid to the emotional integrity of a scene. Maryse Alberti's cinematography is crisp with the cold, early-morning shots of Philadelphia and the gritty shots of urban nightlife looking very nice. The city feels very contemporary, whereas the Philadelphia of the original Rocky film of 1976 belongs to Stallone, the Philadelphia of Creed belongs very much to Michael B. Jordan. There are some lovely stand-out scenes: the row between Adonis and Bianca's MC at the club is expertly managed. The romance between Adonis and Bianca is sweet and plausible but far too tame for my book - I guess we have to cope with current trends somehow. The scene where Rocky reads the newspaper by the gravesides of Adrian and Paulie is poignant. There's a bit where they all fall asleep while watching Skyfall that I thought was hilarious. Freeze-framing different fighters and displaying a graphics read-out of the fighter's credentials is a novel touch and succeeds in not becoming too Guy Ritchie. Tricky moments are handled well, like when, on a couple of occasions, the classic Rocky music swells up, music that's not meant for Creed but nevertheless seems to capture the overall spirit of the film's message - which is you must fight for what you believe in. The moment where Adonis gets knocked out and has flashbacks is done beautifully, with clever use of sound editing, although there could have been more flashbacks of Carl Weathers - and what would have been ultra-cool is at least a glimpse of Drago, who was after all the catalyst behind all of Adonis' issues.I have a handful of minor criticisms and here they are: Bianca's hearing loss seems an affliction too far. It was like everyone else has an affliction ‚Äì Rocky with his cancer, Adonis with his father issues, Ricky Conlan's troubles with the law ‚Äì what can we do with singer Bianca? ‚Äì hey let's give her progressive hearing loss, that's that box ticked! Background characters need to be fleshed out more thoroughly, like Stitch and the other members of the training team - like how Mickey, Paulie and Adrian were fleshed out in the originals. What was happening with the shorts? Did it say ""Johnson"" on one side and ""Creed"" on the other or did I imagine that? Surely making the decisive choice of his name as a fighter should be a clear motive ‚Äì including both names on the shorts seems majorly half-baked. It should be one or the other. Adonis' rich step-mom seemed totally out-of-place in the movie. Why didn't she intervene in getting him out of the brutal correctional facility when he was a kid sooner? If she had done that he might not have wanted to become a boxer which is what she didn't want him to do. She seemed to be in the movie only for exposition reasons. There isn't much character development; by the end of the film everybody is pretty much the same as they were at the start. Also there's not much variety between the characters; everybody is the same nonchalant, shrugging victim of tough lives. It will be interesting to see what direction they take with the sequel and how they replace Rocky, Adrian, Paulie and Mickey with a new boxing family. And hopefully in the next one Adonis will get to drink the raw eggs."
" Here we go again
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,8,"One more in the line of great ""Rocky"" movies. After the original one, the idea of making a franchise that will last for decades may sound pretty ridiculous. I mean, what's there to continue? What can you possibly put in those sequels that won't be copying and repeating the same story with slight variations... Maybe they do copy, maybe they repeat more or less the same story over and over again, maybe they catch us on pathetic emotional tricks and nostalgia, but those tricks obviously accomplish their purpose extremely well. Emotional scenes bring tears to our eyes, fights keep us on the edge of the seats, Stallone acts better and better in every new sequel, production becomes better every time. Maybe it is not original, maybe it uses old tricks to get to us, but it is still great, I mean really great movie.8/10"
" ""Time gets everyone in the end; it's unbeatable.""
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,8,Ryan Coogler directs a fantastic spin off to the Rocky franchise that more than stands on its own. Michael B Jordan is sensational as the son of Apollo Creed who yearns to make a name for himself in the world of boxing. He searches out his fathers best friend and former rival Rocky Balboa to train him who is once again played by Sylvester Stallone in his 7th portrayal of the iconic character. Stallone gives his best performance in years bringing a real sense of emotion and tenderness and is now getting a lot of well deserved Oscar buzz. The fight sequences are also a wonder in themselves with exceptional cinematography that makes you feel like you're right in the ring with them. This is a true crowd pleaser and not only a reboot but a rebirth of the boxing film franchise. I wouldn't be surprised at all if we see CREED 2 rolling up in a year or so and it will be more than welcome. Highly recommended.
" Please just let the Rocky series end once and for all!!
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,6,"I just rented this and am so glad that I didn't waste more money by going to the theater to watch it. It's just the same old, same old Rocky story. The Rocky stories have been beaten to death. The Adonis Creed character, I just couldn't come to like the guy. He came off as a whiney cry baby. Kind of like the angry black guy who thinks he deserves respect. I actually wanted him to lose in the boxing match at the end of the movie because he annoyed the crap out of me. He goes from scene to scene with an angry look on his face and chip on his shoulder. As for Stallone, he did a good job, but he should since he's been playing this character for 40 years now!! Looking back on all the Rocky movies, the only one I truly love and like to watch every now and again is Rocky 1."
" Do you even lift?
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,6,"We watched this movie in a sauna :-) It's fun to watch but you know what's coming every step of the way. You might have called it Rocky VII. It's a good franchise but that doesn't mean you shouldn't put all you got into making it yet again a superb movie. Stallone is definitely the best actor by far. If there's going to be a sequel with Creed then I would like to see him in the shape Apollo Creed was, 30 pounds heavier.To me the biggest flaw in this movie is how a world champion looks like he visits Mac Donalds more than a gym. He looks scary alright but doesn't seem to have done any push-ups, ever... There are so many possible actors for his role, whey did they choose him?"
" An extremely well-acted, well-written and well-choreographed drama.
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,8,"A suitably slow burner in terms of pace; we follow Adonis 'Creed' Johnson as he arrives in Philadelphia from Los Angeles, searching for the famous Rocky Balboa in the hope of persuading him (Rocky) to become his (Creed's) boxing trainer.For those unfamiliar with the franchise, you need not worry. Despite there being an abundance of references to the earlier Rocky films, they are subtle enough that prior knowledge is not essential to being able to enjoy this. All anyone probably needs to know is that Rocky Balboa and Apollo Creed were legendary boxers who were rivals and became friends and Apollo was killed boxing.It is therefore Apollo's legacy that defines his son; we first meet Adonis as an angry and violent kid who never knew his parents. Upon learning who is father was, he grows up to become a deeply conflicted man who is inspired yet tormented by his father's status. As a result, he sets out to follow in his father's footsteps, but for the purpose of ensuring he creates his own legend and escape his father's shadow.Cue relationship-building between Adonis and Rocky, as the latter reluctantly takes on the duty of training his friend's son and getting him ready for the big fight. It is a plot that I deliberately skip over because boxing films can be extremely clich√©d and this was no different; indeed, it was predictable throughout. However, this is not meant as a criticism. What I love about this particular genre of film is that the focus is on the protagonist, and therefore it's easy to gloss over the predictable elements of the story as long as the character's development is convincing. This is true of any genre of course, but it is a significantly key measure of any boxing film because, as I had also suggested, 'the boxer' is always a deeply troubled and complex character, often his own worst enemy, and if that character is to be believable then you need a well written screenplay and a good actor to portray him.Which leads me onto the performances and onto Michael B Jordan who was just fantastic as the eponymous 'Creed'. Physically speaking, he was a sensational athlete; his speed, precision and movement during the various (and excellently choreographed) fight and training scenes were incredible, but just as impressive was his ability to portray such an anguished and conflicted character. He delivers an array of emotions, convincingly portraying Creed's anger, determination, confliction and isolation, but there is also a healthy dose of comedy in this to counter the drama, and Jordan hits the humour with excellent timing and gusto. Equally as impressive is his performance whenever he was on screen with the film's love interest, played by Tessa Thompson. Jordan drops the testosterone and anger levels and seamlessly replaces them with a clumsy innocence and charm, all of which significantly evokes the audience's empathy and fondness towards his character.Of course, the key relationship here is the one between Creed and Rocky, and thankfully the chemistry between Jordan and Stallone was evident. Credit must go to Stallone for his performance as well. Although you could argue that he has had plenty of practice playing the 'old guy' and mentor in The Expendables franchise, laughing at himself and co-stars for not being the young action heroes anymore (perhaps the perfect preparation to hand over another franchise to a younger generation), he gives an extremely sensitive and moving performance as the ageing Balboa, clearly worn out and weary from the tolls of his youth and the losses he has suffered since. The 'old age' humour is still here but it actually compliments the whole story and serves to highlight the aforementioned themes.Praise must also be given to the Director and one of the writers, Ryan Coogler, and his team. Their investment in each of the characters and ability to explore the various themes and ideas really deserves a lot of plaudits. There are intricate subtleties behind every character and in almost every scene; in particular I enjoyed the sense that everyone had their own battles and demons to contend with, not just Creed, and this understated concept actually went a long way to mature his hot-headed nature. I was impressed to discover that Coogler is only 29 years old, and for a man of such inexperience behind the camera, this is an incredible accomplishment. Definitely a name to look out for.Creed is both an ode to the Rocky franchise which it treats it with great respect and positive indulgence, but also a love letter to the city of Philadelphia which is beautifully photographed but also skilfully employed as a symbolism of the Rocky legend.There are still the flaws that plague nearly every boxing film; it is predictable and many of the characters are by the numbers. However, the predictability and weaker characters are predominantly associated with the actual depiction of the sport itself, not the protagonists or the drama they create. Thankfully, this is nearly all about the drama rather than the sport (in fact, there are only 3 boxing matches in the entire film) and that helps to overlook these flaws and otherwise enjoy an extremely well-acted, well-written and well-choreographed drama.Thoroughly recommended to anyone who wants to see a finely polished piece of character driven cinema.For the full review, and further movie reviews, please visit: https://www.facebook.com/JMCReelReviews/"
" Gee, I've seen this episode before
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,5,"The only reason I give this 5 stars is because I enjoyed the character of rocky in his old age at peace with his life after the death of Adrian and being estranged from his son. Stallone was great in that role. As for the rest, it's simply a retread of the same old tired story of the underdog getting his big shot. The characters are all clich√©s and stereotypes. The dialogue is full of the same old hokey sports sayings. The main plot is so predictable, there is no suspense or drama because we already know exactly we're it's going. If this movie stood on its own, with no tie to the beloved rocky franchise, it would be a 1 or 2 star snoozefest, actually it would've never been made at all. I'm sure Creed 2 is coming, but I won't be waiting."
