" Exceptionally well written, acted, structured. And edgy
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,8,"It shouldn't be a thing but it's refreshing to see a movie that treats its audience as having some level of intelligence and not hand feed them every detail.
Many of the jokes are edgy, even more so 7 years after release when I watched this. It pushes boundaries and takes no prisoners and is the better for it.
The characters are real, the settings are real, the events feel real and the effect is heartfelt and entertaining.
This is a clever movie that hits its target and entertains while doing it."
" very interesting structured
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,6,"It is a very internal movie.not very commercial.several stories about the love issues people have,do not watch with your lover.it evokes something,not very strong,not very profound,but enough to make you think about something."
" Dark, funny & adorable
",2020-10-18 00:00:00,10,I love this film for managing to be not just be freaky but also quite moving. Great cast and great script.
" Good but highly uneven...
",2020-08-05 00:00:00,7,"""The Little Death"" is a strange film about sexual fantasies...the sorts of fantasies most people in this movie have great difficulty discussing with their partners. If couples saw this film together, perhaps it would be a great way to get them to open up and discuss their darker or stranger desires....so ""The Little Death"" might be great to share with someone you love. However, I have a few caveats...mostly because the film never is exactly a comedy nor a dark and disturbing picture...it's both. So, for every wonderful and interesting story, there is another that is far more difficult and problematic...and some of them are actually pretty violent and disturbing. I really wish the film had kept a slightly more positive and funny mood...especially at the end, where you have a wonderful segment involving a deaf man and his interpreter....and only moments later, two other people brutally die! The juxtaposition of the funny with the dark is not something I loved. Now having dark fantasies isn't the problem...one lady in the film does have a very common but dark fantasy....it's that the film is funny, tragic and sad all at the same time...an I can imagine that instead of opening up a dialog or leading to a very passionate night, the film might just achieve the opposite because of the strange and ever-changing mood in the movie....too much so to make it a great film but still enjoyable enough that you might enjoy the story overall despite its flaws.By the way, if you normally use closed captions, you might want to turn them off in the final segment involving the sign language interpreter. This is because the film's open captions and the closed captions added later get transposed and you see words to the song being played and not the interpretation of the conversation in Australian sign language. I mention Australian, because I am reasonably fluent in American sign language but cannot fully comprehend what they are saying and needed these captions...especially since Australian 'dirty' signs (signs for sex) are often not the same as the American ones!"
" a sex comedy with no NUDITY ...BUT!!! Alot better than expected.
",2020-03-27 00:00:00,8,"Movie is well written , very damn good performance by almost every lead characters. good story and well connected. But .. sex comedy with SAD ending?.Movies is about (suburban) married couples living the life but they have some SEX fantasies , which movie is totally focus is about. and almost every couple try to do those things for their spouse to full-fill their fantasies.its a fiction movie, but still there is reality in it . especially in many countries (which are socially developed or modern). because of the social media , technology , internet , lifestyle married couple or not , almost many people has their fantasies about sexual feelings or intentions. But sadly even many of these couples try and full-fill their sexual fantasies got ends up badly or broken. As its law of nature , whatever its not natural it wont remain long last. simple n straight."
" Good, funny
",2019-10-30 00:00:00,7,"Funny film, like Everything You Wanted To Know About Sex But Were Afraid To Ask and Happiness."
" Very funny dark comedy
",2019-04-21 00:00:00,8,"May have missed the core audience, but Little Death is a film that will live on through cult status. Australian films lack the ability to showcase the darker side of comedy, so this is a real shock. It's nice to see a film outside the government system that achieves an independent status. Great cast and some strong moments. Won't please everyone but this quirky comedy should garner more attention."
" You'll love it or hate it
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,8,"I loved it,
Entertaining, well acted, comic at times and seriously just about people, with all our strangeness"
" Ugh
",2018-08-14 00:00:00,1,Boring and inconclusive. Not impressed at all... Hdjdhdhdhdjdjjdjdjfjdjwooqisbdbxjeowojwjwowodbcd
" Didn't expect much but it was truly magical
",2018-06-05 00:00:00,8,"I put this movie on for background noise, and by the 15 minute mark I was more committed than most movies I have seen.
The twist and laughs the sad parts and the drama. It had a little of everything and when it finally wrapped up I had to go online and see what others thought right away. I see the majority felt the same. There are a few out there, as there always is that might not get it. But def. worth seeing."
" Funny relationship film
",2018-03-15 00:00:00,9,"Very funny Aussie adult comedy. The movie is about half-dozen couples all with problems in the bedroom. Each of the couples take on a new approach into improving their sex lives with hilarious outcomes. Although the movie is an adult comedy, there is no nudity. This film is just plain fun to watch. The video call scene near the end of the film almost had me peeing in my pants. It was very funny. The film also has a dark comedy side to it that wraps up the film at the very end. I really enjoyed this film."
" A funny, intelligent film about sex that avoids being brash
",2018-02-08 00:00:00,9,"This film looks behind closed doors into the sex lives of a bunch of fairly normal Australians who live in the same area.This is not a documentary or is it a serious film, it is a light romantic comedy.The characters involved realise some of their sexual fantasies with their partners.
The film flits from family to family examining some of the emotional and situation byproducts of these fantasies.
To have a sexual fantasy is one thing, the logistics of carrying it out can be another thing completly.What is so good about this film is its lightness and grounding.
There are no crude, silly jokes about dildos and at no point does anyone run around in a gimp suit wearing a strap-on.
The characters are realistic and endearing and you really do feel for them.The acting and casting is great! The production and lighting is excellent.I found this genuinely funny and intriguing to watch.Despite the subject matter there is no nudity and the sex is handled very responsibly.A very good, light film about an intriguing subject with laughs on the way
What more could you want?"
" Where's the end?
",2017-05-09 00:00:00,4,"This movie was really entertaining and had a lot going for it in the story, but I felt like the last 20 minutes of the film just got cut out. Climax, then straight to end credits, with no resolution. The characters and their plights were all appealing and drawing, but the lack of resolution really left me disappointed."
" Wow!! This film is now one of by favorite flicks of all time.
",2017-03-21 00:00:00,10,"Who would have thought a movie I had suggested to me by Netflix could be so darn good? It would be one thing if it was a great plot only but I can't think of anything about this movie that isn't top notch. The casting, writing, acting,editing, and production are all superb. If you are not put off by the adult nature (and even if you are a bit) you should see this one."
