" Poor execution of a somewhat decent book.
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,4,"The book was kinda good. At least the only readable book of Mr Chetan Bhagat. But the film was terrible. While some scenes were good, like the ones involving the parents and the Chennai scenes, etc. The movie is overall quite bad. The acting of the great Arjun Kapoor, need I say anything else? Alia was okay but the chemistry between the two was quite cold. It could have been better, but at the end this is what you get."
" Way too long
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,6,"The plot itself was not that bad at all. it's just that this movie drags on to an infuriating length to an inevitable predictable ending. The performance of the two lead are good but they don't have that much chemistry. Arjun Kapoor gives one of the better performances in his career, Alia Bhatt is clearly not as good as she is today. Her career was just starting to find its footing, but she's good nonetheless. The movie carries a golden message that many people need to hear and also challenges the viewer's thinking about the themes it features. The movie also manages to balances comedy and drama well and finds the humor in teaching a valuable lesson. The soundtrack is good but it's the original background score that steals the show, it's never intrusive nor too muted, it just enhances the scenes nicely. The cinematography is okay, I don't like the way the film looks, it looks kinda blurry, and the actors faces look like they're wearing tons of make-up."
" A delightful watch for a brilliantly executed movie.......
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,10,"After many days, Chetan Bhagat's novel, by the same name, saw the light of the day and finally adapted to screen after much initial delays. If you didn't read the book at first, then the movie will be an interesting watch for you. For those who have already read the book, it would be delightful for them to translate the text to movie scenes. The story deals with how two souls met at a premium MBA institute of India, IIM Ahmedabad and how their friendship turned into a love affair. But the journey from love to getting married is not so easy to travel, in India. Here not only the lovers need to love each other but their parents also need to love each other. Hence starts the journey of Krish,a Punjabi boy and Ananya, a Tamilian brahmin girl from falling in love to finally getting married. The first thing to be noted about this movie are the brilliant performances of the lead characters, Arjun Kapoor and Alia Bhatt. The terrific chemistry between these stars directly brings out the characters from the pages of the book and makes you believe that you are not watching a movie. Alongwith them, Ronit Roy,Amrita Singh, Revathy and Shiv Kumar Subramaniam also performed brilliantly. The screenplay was sharp, intelligent, neat and tidy. Music was good, but could have been better. New time director Abhishek Varman did a commendable job by taking the best out of everyone. Highly recommended. A movie that deserves repeat watching."
" A combo package with some good melodious songs and good story in it!
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,9,"First of all, Alia was exceptional. Loved her appearance on the screen. Her male co-actor was superb as well. I love the total package that it offers. Loved it."
" Well sometimes movie is better than the book
",2020-05-21 00:00:00,7,"Loved this movie 2 States. I remember I went to watch this movie with no expectations whatsoever. I didn't liked the book very much and it was a friend who took me for this movie. But frankly, I was surprised. I actually liked the movie. Story of distant love relationship and two families with different background and culture, Arjun and Alia were perfect in this movie. Loved them actually. Songs were nice. All in all a very well made romance entertainer."
" Funny and nuanced
",2019-09-17 00:00:00,7,I loved this movie. Featured the funny and wonderful differences between different Indian ethnicities
" Funny and smart, and detailed oriented on ethnic nuancds
",2019-09-17 00:00:00,7,I loved this film. The writers really captured the nuances between different enthic groups in India. The songs were good too.
" A good story with an average cast
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,5,"If the story is coming from a best selling novel, the chances already get elevate for a good movie. The casting could have been better for the two main characters."
" 2 States (2014)
",2018-12-06 00:00:00,7,Though it's a love story and a Hindi film it is not your usual Hindi film. It taps into a serious issues like the inter state marriages and the issues of breaking social conventions in the end. There is a good flow and good songs for that is major requirement in marketing a Hindi film. Though it has songs it is a well structured Hindi film and a must see for any Bollywood film praiser.Overall - 3.5/5
" Average Movie
",2018-08-15 00:00:00,6,"It is not very bad but not that good either. This movie is typical and predictable but it has some funny and witty lines,some good scenes and drama and it is overall a good watch to kill time. Alia cannot act but she is not that bad at least she is okay and does a decent act. The others are pretty wooden and typical but this movie would have been great without Arjun Kapoor who is sleep and drowsy and looks like he is in the verge of death. He does live till the climax but you may die of his terrible acting(or lack of it)and dialogue delivery. Apart from him the movie is worth a watch."
" Creepy
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,1,After having a lot of sex they decided to take permission to marry...creepy!! Why they need to take permission for marriage then? If they are so obedient shouldn't they think about it before having sex?
" Sweet and Charming Film- Good Chemistry of Lead Couple
",2018-07-10 00:00:00,6,"I revisited this film recently and enjoyed it just as much as the first time. The film opens with a therapy session attended by the hero of the film, Krish. Arjun Kapoor actually fits the role very well and it is one of the only times that Arjun seems comfortable in a film. There are some very funny moments and his deadpan expression at the face of some uncomfortable moments were hilarious! Alia Bhatt portrays the character of Ananya, a classmate of Krish's and the movie quickly delves into the backstory of how the lead pair met.The chemistry between Alia and Arjun was crackling and they looked very much in love, doing full justice to their characters. The first quarter of the film and their life in college seemed very fresh. Later, when their families meet, there are some very awkward moments that made me laugh.As Krish and Ananya try to convince their family to allow them to get married, there are many bumps along the way, and the movie was able to show the problems in a very realistic manner.The music and the acting were highlights in the movie. The songs are catchy and have moderate recall value. The supporting cast were very good and added some good acting chops to the whole production.Overall, a good, light movie that leaves the viewer happy."
" Awesome movie, pleasant music.
",2018-04-15 00:00:00,9,"Wonderful movie, based on problem arises on marriage due to cultural difference between families. Soothing music, fresh faces, engaging story till the end. Worth watching multiple times with family."
" Nice story line but representation is Okok
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,5,"Story is from one of the novel of Chetan Bhagat. Very nicely written. Movie contains a starting story from University. Love start, meetings happen means everything happened but married life lacks happiness due to lack of faith in India's 2-states cultures. Thats a story.Romance is too much. Nicely created drama. But that I noted is representation is not good. The movie goes line to line. Suspense and drama didn't have much attraction. I just loved the truth between two states cultures and trust line representation of Indian Culture. Truth Indian Culture is very well represented but actual heart touching concepts of Indian Culture lacks somewhere.Overall they tried their best and it's true concept."
" Truth -- tragedy Of Indian Culture but attraction lacks
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,4,The representation lacks the attraction but based on truth. Every where I got missed thing that is no attraction due less attractive drama. Romance lacks truth of romance. Indian culture representation is truth. I didn't liked their Chemistry. The one thing I loved is Truth Representation of Indian Culture. Greatly represents Boyish thinking in Indian blood. On the whole they have everything in movie. But lacks way that could attractive.
