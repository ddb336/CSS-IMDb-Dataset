" Awesome movie ðŸŽ¥
",2021-04-11 00:00:00,8,Watching movies like this shows how much we are charged in front of nature.
" on edge
",2021-04-07 00:00:00,7,"The premise of climbing Mount Everest inherently gives this movie an edge, because it would be near impossible for viewers to not already have a heightened sense of anxiety about all of the characters, likable or not. I knew going into it that things would end badly because I was aware of the real events, but even if you don't, there is a sense of impending doom that makes everything tense to watch, in a captivating way. I would have appreciated more of an exploration about the politics of rich white people hiring local Sherpas for pointless expeditions, but that could be hard to weave in seamlessly."
" Good movie
",2021-04-07 00:00:00,7,"I love movies based on true stories. The view is stunning but I cannot help to think about the pollution that visitors have created throughout the show.If pollution on Everest does not bother you, I highly recommend this show!"
" ""Ever-rest"" is aptly named
",2021-04-05 00:00:00,6,"Everest is based on the story of the 1996 expedition to climb Mount Everest gone wrong, causing several casualties.The first hour of the movie, which should have set up the story as well as a good foundation of characters' background, doesn't do any of that. It mostly consists of airport and travel scenes, goodbyes, and mini dialogues about previous mountain experiences. All of that ends up to be a very boring and shallow first part of the movie, which thus lacks intensity. This is especially important to know, because, in the second half. When things become tragic, the viewer does not feel an emotional attachment to the characters, because he barely knows them.Within that, the characters are extremely flat and none of the actors' performances stand out. For example, Jake Gyllenhaal's part could have been played by anybody else. Having stars in the movie did not contribute to its quality, only to its notoriety.In the second part, things start to go downhill (storms, avalanches, lack of equipment resulting in deaths, etc.) and the movie changes pace. In some sequences, the movie gets more intense, like the helicopter rescue and the husband and wife farewell over the phone. However, the movie doesn't make the step from telling a very dramatic story to emotionally involving the viewer in it.That being said, the whole movie is supported by the spectacular Everest landscaping. 6 out of 10."
" I'm sorry but these people were idiots
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,5,"The whole movie it's like these are your instructors and will save you by following these rules which they then go onto break , most of the people die ,so the story is just made up since there is no one to have told all these tales. Don't bother."
" Everest
",2021-02-25 00:00:00,6,"I remember seeing the trailer for this film in the cinema, I didn't realise it was based on a true story, I was looking forward to it because of a good cast, positive ratings, and it looked good, so directed by Baltasar KormÃ¡kur (Contraband, 2 Guns, Trapped, Adrift). Basically, New Zealand's intrepid mountaineer, Robert ""Rob"" Edwin Hall (Jason Clarke), with his company named ""Adventure Consultants"", has been guiding amateur climbers on Mount Everest since 1992. In May 1996, several commercial expeditions at the base camp of Everest prepare to climb to the summit. Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal) is the chief guide for rival adventure company, Mountain Madness. Rob's clients include experienced climber Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin), former mailman Doug Hansen (The Sessions' John Hawkes) who is pursuing his dream, climbing veteran Yasuko Namba (Naoko Mori) who hopes to complete her final Seven Summits ascent, and Outside magazine journalist Jon Krakauer (Michael Kelly). Helen Wilton (Emily Watson) manages Rob's base camp. Before leaving New Zealand a month earlier, Rob said goodbye to his pregnant wife, Jan (Keira Knightley), and promised that he will be home for the birth. At the base camp, Rob receives a fax from her, informing him that their unborn baby is a girl. He wants to name her Sarah, but Jan disagrees. Worried about climbers overcrowding, Rob persuades Scott to cooperate to reduce delays. On the summit attempt, Rob's group departs from Camp IV before dawn, planning to complete the ascent and begin descending by 2:00pm, the latest safe time to ensure return before nightfall. The group discovers that guide ropes are not installed on the upper reaches of the climb, this delays them by over an hour. Beck has eyesight problems and stops. Rob tells him to return to base camp if his condition worsens in half an hour. Scott hurries down to camp to help another climber, but plans to reascend, and Rob warns him about overexertion. Rob reaches the summit on time and is joined by other climbers including Yasuko, who is elated to plant her Japanese flag. Descending, Rob encounters Doug struggling to ascend just above the Hillary Step and orders him to go back down. Doug insists on continuing, saying that he will not get the chance again. Rob reluctantly agrees and they reach the summit two hours later, well past the safe return time. Doug is exhausted and suffering from altitude sickness. With them, Scott is also exhausted and suffering high-altitude pulmonary edema (fluid accumulation in the lungs). As Rob helps Doug down, a blizzard strikes while Doug's oxygen tank is empty, causing him to suffer hypoxia. No extra bottles are stored on route as Rob asked and he radios Helen to send more oxygen. Rob briefly leaves Doug, who semi-consciously detaches himself from the guide rope and walks unsteadily along the narrow path, then silently falls to his death. Scott's condition worsens. He tells his fellow climbers to go on without him. He lies down and later dies. Descending climbers reach Beck, whose vision is still impaired, but they all become lost as the blizzard obliterates the trail. Three climbers go for help, leaving Beck and Yasuko. Guide Andy 'Harold' Harris (The Ring's Martin Henderson) reaches Rob with spare oxygen, but the cylinder opening is frozen shut. They huddle together in the storm. While Rob sleeps, Andy begins to hallucinate. He then strips off his outer clothing and slides to his death. In the morning, Rob radios Helen that Doug and Andy are gone, and that his limbs are frozen. Helen calls Jan, hoping that Rob will respond to her voice. Jan tells Rob that he must keep moving. Rob tells her that he is cold but otherwise comfortable, and asks her to name their baby Sarah, dying soon afterwards. Returning climbers tell the camp that Beck and Yasuko are stranded. But the severe weather makes a rescue impossible. Helen calls Beck's wife, Peach (Robin Wright), and informs her of the situation. In the morning, Beck miraculously awakens, but finds that Yasuko is dead. He stumbles down to camp alone, severely frostbitten and in need of medical help. Peach calls the American Embassy and organises a helicopter rescue. Nepal Army pilot Lieutenant Colonel Madan Khatri Chhetri (Vijaya Lama) flies a helicopter to take Beck to hospital. Meanwhile, one of Scott's guides, Anatoli Boukreev (Ingvar Sigurdsson), finds his body, and moves it off the trail. Returning home, Helen and Jan have an emotional reunion, and Jan later successfully gives birth to a daughter who she names Sarah. Beck returns to his family, heavily bandaged. The ending reveals that he lost both hands and nose to frostbite, and that Rob's body remains on Everest. Also starring Sam Worthington as Guy Cotter, Elizabeth Debicki as Caroline MacKenzie, Thomas M. Wright as Michael Groom, Tom Goodman-Hill as Neal Beidleman, Clive Standen as Ed Viesturs, Vanessa Kirby as Sandy Hill Pittman, and Mia Goth as Meg Weathers. The ensemble cast all do well in their parts, the fateful climbing sequences are gripping, the freezing conditions and nail-biting moments get your attention, and the sights and scenery (filmed in the Austrian Alps, Iceland, and Nepal) look great, a most worthwhile adventure thriller. Good!"
" Quit doing this
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,4,The storyline of people climbing mountains and needing rescue is worn out. Do anything else. Maybe removing the actual garbage these teams leave on Everest would make a better film.
" A Devastating Absurdist Drama
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,7,"In philosophy, ""the Absurd"" refers to the conflict between the human tendency to seek inherent value and meaning in life, and the human inability to find any in a purposeless, meaningless or chaotic and irrational universe (Dotterweich, 2019).
The absurdist philosopher Albert Camus stated that individuals should embrace the absurd condition of human existence. He believed that life should be lived to the fullest and that meaning was meant to be found in ourselves and not by outside nature.""Everest"" is a story about absurdism. It is about people who decide to climb the Everest because they made up their mind that that is their call. Makes sense, as seeing Camus metaphor for the absurdist philosophy was the Myth of Sisyphus, who was punished to push a rock up a hill again and again. The climb became his purpose.
The adventure they go on has no purpose. It is full of dangers, semi-bad decisions based on ego and capital, and is struck by bad weather. The films shows through training montages all the reasons why not to go up the mountain. So much so that you start asking who would want to go on such a dangerous mission? These men, why? Because it's...(you know...).
The film avoids all opportunities to find a purpose to their story - The climb did not end badly because of economic decisions (although it did help), it did not happen because of ego to get to the top (although it did help) and it didn't happen because of bad weather (although it mainly helped) - It is all these random circumstances that led to this horrific tragedy in 1996.
The film shows the ignorance and courage that these men had to have in order to go up the mountain. It is their purpose that is explored yet never glorified or made a villain. The result is a well told tale of admirable people that leaves the viewer empty. The last 30 mins are some of the hardest moments one could have seen on an IMAX screen (way back when those were a thing). The fact that this movie was packaged as a summer blockbuster in 2015 is a decision so absurd you almost think that it was by design.
Films about how life has no purpose usually make that the point of their stories (look at ""A Serious Man"" as an example) but ""Everest"" doesn't tell you that. It simply shows life as a no pre-destined goal world and the people who search for purpose in it.
That might be a more complicated depiction in film, but it also leaves one wonder why to sit down and experience that? What is to be earned? What is to be enjoyed even?
Perhaps just the view."
" Awesome Scenery, Predictable Dangers, Nothing New
",2021-02-03 00:00:00,6,"(Flash Review)Follows the story of climbing expedition groups and the voyage to the top of Everest. It touches on character's passion for climbing, families left at home worrying, how crowded it has become on the few routes and conflicts that arise. Oh and of course the risk and danger at every step. Feel the cold and wind. Feel lungs strain for every breath. Feel the extreme drive to keep climbing. Of course getting up is only half the battle. You didn't think a Hollywood movie titled Everest would go smoothly did you? Ratchet up the drama and the weather for the dramatic decent rife with life teetering on the precipice. This has everything you'd expect, amazing mountaintop views, human struggle and will to survive and it does its best to ratchet up the emotions. It certainly achieves its objective."
" Mwah
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,6,"For the ones who don't know the true background story the movie is confusing. Also to many characters in the movie and with the snow gear on it was not clear who was who. I only had sympathy for Rob, but still doesn't get why they don't go for a second rescue and why they don't collect the dead bodies. Disappointed."
" Gripping drama
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,8,"By 1996 guided climbs of Mount Everest has become an industry. The pioneer of this is New Zealander Rob Hall and he now leads another climb up the mountain. His climbs have largely been incident-free but this time will be different.A gripping drama, based on actual events. Captures well the elation and spirit of adventure (I imagine, I'm no mountain-climber) of mountaineering. Gives an inkling into why people would do such a dangerous thing and how life-threatening a pastime it is. Also demonstrates just how the line between survival and death can hinge on one bad decision or one piece of bad luck.Director Baltasar KormÃ¡kur sets up the movie well, building engagement with the characters, and letting you know just how dangerous things can be. He then displays a deft hand at showing the gritty reality when things go bad. Great, emotional conclusion too.Cinematography is superb, adding to the realism. Stunning backdrops.This is all helped by a cast that seems to consist entirely of well-known stars: Jason Clarke (as Rob Hall), Josh Brolin, Jake Gyllenhaal, Keira Knightley, Michael Kelly, Robin Wright, Emily Watson, Sam Worthington, Elizabeth Debicki. None put a foot wrong and their performances aid the engagement and realism of the film."
" Anatoli Boukreev was a hero
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,7,"It's clear that this movie relies heavily on Jon Krakauer's book ""Into Thin Air"". Although not to the extent that Krakauer - whose account is regarded as historical truth - probably would have wanted, as he comes off as not completely sympathetic in this movie (although better than in real life, where he comes off as a total a-hole).The movie pretty much ignores Anatoli Boukreev and G. Weston DeWalt's book ""The Climb"", considering the scene of the meeting where Scott Fischer is surprised when Boukreev says he intends to summit without oxygen. Let's just say that Boukreev tells a different story in his book.So the vilification of Boukreev, which started with Krakauer's article published in Outside (and which he continues to this day, slandering the dead), is perpetuated in this Hollywood movie. His heroic actions, including his attempt to save Fischer, are treated almost like cutaway scenes. Instead the movie focuses on fictional scenes with Rob Hall, Andy Harris and Doug Hansen to which there are - of course - no witnesses.If you haven't read anything about this event - and I recommend both Krakauer and especially Boukreevs's books - the movie must be quite confusing as it unfolds. The geography could have been handled better. For example you don't really get a sense of where Camp IV is in relation to the group who gets lost (Yasuko Namba et al.).The effects are good for the most part. There are a number of daylight scenes (especially in strong sunlight) where the lighting and compositing look quite fake, as they were obviously shot in a studio.That said, the movie was entertaining. Just don't consider it truth."
" Seven for the Seventh Summit
",2020-10-05 00:00:00,7,"An incredible true story, which maybe doesn't translate to film as well as one would hope. Based on the facts and true conditions, this gives a glimpse into what Everest truly is, the severity of which people don't have the opportunity to see very often. Casting and acting was good (Knightly with a pretty impressive kiwi accent), but it's tough to spin this event into a true cinematic story."
" Everest..
",2020-08-18 00:00:00,10,"I loved this movie, based on a true story.I wasn't a big fan of Jason Clarke until I watched this, but he did a solid job in it, some very good performances throughout, some nice shots and the scenery is great and very well directed..I went on to read 'Into thin air' by Jon Krakauer, who was one of the survivors of this fateful expedition, very good book if you want a more personal account of what happened and some nice photography in it too.."
" Life is crazy
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,10,"I've been going through others comments on this movie especially the the that gave it 2-6 points out of 10 for this movie.
What is interesting is they like the movie but don't like the stupidity of the characters actions that led to the tragic consequences of themselves and dragging others down with them! But that is true that actually happened!
Check out Wikipedia on this incident!
It's sad but a true tale of both courage and pure selfishness and extreme stupidity.
It's a lesson to be learned!!!!!!
But with us being humans we never listen!Acting is great great cast!
Robin Wright looks like she's been pulled through rubbish dumpster and back great natural looking make-up.
Josh Brolin minus Frostbitten fingers and nose, returns in the future, to click what's left of his fingers which is 'inevitable!'
Jason Clarke as Rob hall was excellent better than his John Connor in Terminator. This film really pushed his limits."
" Grim but true
",2020-07-16 00:00:00,7,"Anyone who has spent days and nights in the mountains in Winter time knows that they are beautiful but uncompromising places. If conditions turn bad, which can happen frequently and quickly, they can be terrible. And it can defeat the best of men in the peak of fitness and with the best equipment and training. One mistake, or moment of lack of humility to the mountain leading to a bad decision, can have very serious consequences. This film does a pretty good job at showing all of that. The location shots and recreation of the mountain are just incredible, but the the movie otherwise is mixed - the first quarter does not hit home and and is rather boring, and the pacing throughout is off, it manages to feel rushed despite the long play time. A lot of film is wasted. Nonetheless it achieves it's core purpose extremely well and with integrity."
" NEVER REST
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,8,"This is an excellent movie. Good acting, great script and terrifying plot. Honestly, it is difficult for me to find any sympathy for any of the characters tho. At no stage does the movie give any appearance of professionalism or low risk. Anybody who ventures up on this crazed escapade does so with full knowledge that he or she is putting his own life and that of others at extreme risk. Zero sympathy when that eventuates. Choice! And ego!!"
" Powerful and arresting
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,8,"A stunning, moving dramatization of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster, drawn from the accounts of several survivors. This incident actually involves author Jon Krakauer, who documented his own experience in the '97 page-turner Into Thin Air, though some disputes have been raised against his work and it's not cited as a reference for the film. As one might expect, there's no shortage of breathtaking scenery and bowel-shaking peeks down into the gaping abyss, and those are clearly a high priority for the production. They're a grand mix of CGI and on-location footage, real IMAX-quality eye candy that should scratch a giant itch for lovers of the outdoors or fans of air-sucking Earth porn. The film's dramatic turns, surprisingly enough, are just as effective. Though it's overloaded with big names, from Josh Brolin and Jake Gyllenhaal to Keira Knightly and Robin Wright, each effectively fades into a more pedestrian role and none, save a few appropriately loud-mouthed scenes from Brolin, threaten to take the production over. Though the passage of time is occasionally a bit underplayed, especially as the climbers acclimate to altitude, it works very well as both a pulse-pounder and a gut-punch. Powerful and arresting, it reaches brazenly for the heavens without losing track of its human origins, which is far easier said than done."
" Just couldn't get into it at all
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,5,"The film just never hooked me. It was sad see all them people die knowing that actually happened. There was too many characters to know what was going on I never had any idea who was who. It never really focused on anyone so I couldn't connect with any of the characters. Also how cool was jake gyllenhaal's character, was very gutted he died."
" Mixed emotions
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,6,"Right. I'm just going to jump straight into what I didn't like about it. There was way too many characters to focus on and with them all wearing masks and big coats I had no idea who was who. There was no character arcs either, I know it's based on a true story but you didn't relate to any. Meaning I wasn't that fussed if something happened to them.It was also just a bit pointless, like did this need to be made to a film? The plot just felt a bit empty.What's good? Cinematography was fantastic. The shots of the mountain was brilliant. Acting was pretty decent from all involved also. But yeah 6/10 from me, the negatives outweigh the positives and made this average film."
" Why? Just......Why??
",2020-03-07 00:00:00,3,"I really don't get it and it angers me some what that people are so stupid & selfish, that they would risk their lives, ruin their families lives and the lives of anybody else with them, just so they can be part of a very elite group of people! I have zero sympathy to the victims but a huge amount to their grieving families! Life is a gift and should be appreciated more than these clowns did.Rant over, the acting is quite good and the cinematography is beautiful. Worth a watch but can be slow in parts"
" Irresponsible Adventurers
",2020-03-05 00:00:00,4,"Anyone who thinks it is exciting to walk into a lions den deserves to get their head chewed off! Hiking up Everest is an Exhausting, Freezing, Mind Bending, Breath Taking, Selfish adventure that should be outlawed. The only thing saving this movie is the scenery and the acting. You know from the start that a bunch of hikers are going to die. In these circumstances, that is a certainty!! There is NOTHING fun about this experience!! There is only anxiety and fear on the part of the friends and family waiting below!!"
" Everest is a dizzying and emotional ride. ( B+ Movie) My Ratings 9/10
",2020-02-17 00:00:00,9,The film really brings the audiences to the expedition of the mountain. Great job and God rest the souls of the climbers who never made it back.
" Movie is good for.......
",2020-02-07 00:00:00,7,A star studded movie with tons of cameos and great actors. I was freezing while watching it. Really enjoyed it. Hope everyone does as well
" Absolutely no sympathy
",2020-01-30 00:00:00,1,"That idiot who said that he climbed Everest 'because it was there' should have been jeered to the rafters rather than being emulated for ever more. Was it in the way of some proper goal? Did he not know that the Earth, to scale, is as smooth as a billiard ball? Climbing Everest is a task fit for a microbe. But it is all part of the macho game; the same game that drives many people to go to war just so that they can forever hold their heads high in the camp bars of the future. This film is all the more irritating because groups of blind, disabled and other minority groups have made the ascent successfully; why focus on failures who started out with every advantage? Moaning about the deaths of these moronic show-offs somehow demeans the very concept of tragedy."
" Exciting despite defects
",2020-01-13 00:00:00,8,"Films about adventures in extreme conditions like space, underwater, desert are already evoking expectations as we are ready to buy whatever we are served. This is definitely one of them. The scenery is great, I wonder how much of it belongs to real Everest. The pace of the film is regular and gets into the subject without boring romantic stories. Some shortcomings, however, do exist concerning technical issues. For example, in most of the movie the mountaineers were wearing ordinary sunglasses or nothing at all to protect their eyes. I was expecting that they wore goggles and balaclava at all times. They might have been purposefully removed so that we could distinguish the characters. Whatever, it is easy to criticize this way. Other than this, in my opinion the ordeal of surviving in extreme conditions could have been augmented even further. Despite all these, it is rewatchable and deserves an 8/10."
" disappointing
",2019-12-31 00:00:00,3,"I was hoping for an exciting action adventure movie, but it's just a boring drama."
" Perfect
",2019-12-31 00:00:00,10,This movie is just made for big screens or a night with the family so see it. I think it is worth it.
" Let's use artistic license as an excuse to completely falsify the event
",2019-10-25 00:00:00,2,"Really? Another movie about the 1996 Everest tragedy? Oh, and this time we will use artistic license to completely misrepresent characters, twist facts, deny real heroes their recognition and generally throw random crap at the audience. With the 15 second attention spans of today, it is disgusting that a segment of the population will be in awe of this banal worthless attempt. I was at the edge of my seat as the helicopter clipped the snow bank (yeah, not really, only complete idiots would have bought into that).
Next time, change the name of mountain, the characters and everything else and see if you can sell such an insulting script to people who actually have a 3 digit IQ.
Dr. Weathers could not have possibly given consent to this feeble attempt of mis-represented drama and tragedy where the man who risked his life to rescue him was not even mentioned by title or accurate portrayal.
The only reason for a couple of stars is that there are fleeting moments of scenery that remind me of the mountains and their majesty."
" Everest tourism
",2019-09-08 00:00:00,6,"Everest has an all star cast, great scenery, some nice shots when disaster strikes. The trouble is it's just too disjointed and starts sluggishly as it needs to introduce its over crowded cast and characterisation.Based on true events that happened in 1996. Two commercial expeditions led by Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) and Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal) team up to climb the summit of Everest together. However a severe blizzard spells disaster for the climbers as they need to descent the mountain.Despite starting slowly we never get much depth regarding the characters or their motivations. It also never delves into the commercialization of these Everest expeditions where people go for adventure tourism and pay top dollar. Even though it is based on true events the narrative never grabs you but the mountain looks exhilarating and scary at the same time."
" Excellent Movie
",2019-08-21 00:00:00,8,Watched this movie recently in TV. Its really good. Movie really replicated the accident. Cinematography looks very natural. Its make us to feel in Himalayas.
" Slow but interesting movie...
",2019-08-06 00:00:00,7,"A group mountain climbers n their unexpected spine chilling moments,
which based on real events First half is as usual just setting up the film tone..main characters and their mission In Second Half there are so many thrilling n intense scenes it keeps viewer to hooked till end Josh brolin performance is one the highlight of this film..inbetween so many melodramatic moments makes bit boring.. The most Amazing part of this movie is top angle visuals of Majestic mount everest n bgm no words describe about that really a top class cinematography in recent Hollywood films."
" ""The last word always belongs to the mountain.""
",2019-07-28 00:00:00,7,"This is an excellent primer for anyone considering a mountain climbing experience. It ought to convince you to stay home and wait by the fireplace with a nice snifter of brandy on hand. And the thing is, for the amateur climbers who hoped to scale Mt. Everest, a lot of the prep work was already done for them, things like those ladder bridges and all the rope climbs that had to be in place in order to get up those icy verticals. Imagine if they had to do that themselves. Well, I'm convinced it's not for me, even if the end result would be that you're sitting on top of the world.What one does get to consider regarding the successful climbers is what a reverence and awe they place in the accomplishment. The mountain itself is extremely unforgiving of mistakes and miscalculations, and even the pros take life into their own hands with every attempt. Then there's the often unknowable element of weather conditions that play havoc virtually at the drop of a hat. For those who make this their life's work I express my sincere admiration; it takes a certain rare individual to face all those elements on any given day.The only thing that took me out of the story were the presence of the celebrity actors who participated in the project. You know going in that Jason Clarke, John Hawkes, Josh Brolin, and Jake Gyllenhaal aren't really risking life and limb for the sake of the movie. It might have been better to use less familiar faces in their roles to lend a greater pathos to the eventual fates that befell the ones who didn't make it. Still, it's a gripping story based on an actual event that occurred in 1996, and a powerful reminder that not all attempts at personal goal fulfillment will end successfully."
" Characters lost in the scenery
",2019-07-26 00:00:00,7,"High altitude mountaineering is incredibly dangerous, and was once the preserve only of the most brilliant, and dedicated, climbers. But in a world where rich people look for the ultimate experience, some climbers have found they can make a living by guiding lesser mortals to the highest summits, none more desired than the highest peak in the world, Mount Everest. We know now what this has led to: queues of people on the highest point on earth, and periodic tragedy. And a big question is what it really means to ""guide"" under conditions so extreme, where anyone can lose their sense of reason under shortage of oxygen, and when demented ambition and fierce storms can wreck the best laid plans. In 1996, high altitude guiding was relatively new when tragedy struck the parties of guides Rob Hall and Scott Fisher. The presence of journalist Jon Krakauer in Hall's party ensured that the story was well-told; 'Everest' is in fact the second movie based on Krakauer's book. It's a higher budget affair than its predecessor, and a little less corny, but essentially very similar. Perhaps it brings out some of the individual stories a little less strongly, although the visuals are predictably stunning. Twenty years on, it's hard to know the right solution; but also hard not to conclude that people are very bad at calculating odds."
" Ok film about mans narcissism
",2019-07-10 00:00:00,7,"This was recently on Tv and I decided to watch because I had been hearing about all the issues on Everst lately. This film did nothing to dispel me of the belief that all these groups of people that are climbing Everest are just nihilistic narcissist. Now I understand challenging yourself or doing something some one else has never done. But these people climbing Everest are not accomplishing anything new. The top of Everest is becoming a dumb and a graveyard. Your putting the life of all the locals in danger when they have to be rescued. Yes I know it brings in foreign money to an area that needs it but its gotten out of control. When you throw yourself out of an airplane with a chute the chance of you hurting anyone but yourself is incredibly small but because climbing Everest takes so much logistics and money your basically coopting the locals for your vanity project
And thats what all these climbers are doing it for now. Just need to see the que of climbers waiting to get up last few hundred feet to know its turning into the death trap Disneyland. Want to kill yourself go ahead but dont expect a rescue"
" my notes
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,5,"Ok movie. some cool scenes, intense moments and nice visuals. overall nothing special and pretty forgettable (1 viewing)"
" It's okay could be better
",2019-06-21 00:00:00,5,"I feel like the movie insults the viewer's intelligence with the fact that the whole situation started when the Main Guide(Big Man Sherpa) decided to risk his life and implicitly risked his unborn daughter growing up without a father just because a Mailman(a customer who wanted to reach the top of the mountain) convinced him to go the extra mile and reach the top albeit not being aware of the dangers he was already in and refused to turn back. To make matters worse, the movie is based on a true story? I'm not sure how much of it is true, the main guide's body is still on the mountain, I'm not surprised since he was taking advice from his customers rather then doing his job and ending up killing both himself and the mailman.

",2019-04-27 00:00:00,7,"Based on a true story from 1996.Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) leads a group of climbers up Everest.He is a ""hand holder"" and safety comes first with him. He had prevented his last group from reaching the top because of a storm. Scott Fisher (Jake Gyllenhaal) leads another group. He feels if a person can't make it on their own, they don't deserve to reach the top. Most of the film is build up. They spend 40 days walking up the mountain in an attempt to acclimate. There are scenes which explain the hazards to the body such as lack of oxygen and cold.The disaster doesn't happen to late in the film, i.e. after an hour. As far as disaster films go, watching people laying down covered with snow on is realistic, but not as exciting as a hungry Yeti chasing them. I did not watch the film in IMAX for which it was designed. I would suggest to get the full effect of the mountain, IMAX is a must, otherwise the film will just be light drama and light action. There is only so much of snow blowing across a mountain I can watch. The film emphasizes safety, teamwork, and family.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity. And yes that was Keira Knightley."

",2019-04-11 00:00:00,7,"A sober tribute to the people who have mountains in their blood ! While it highlights the perils and the degeneration caused by commercialization of an elite passion like mountaineering, it gives an insight into the minds of the individuals who would rather die than to live away from the mountains ! From Rob Hall to Anatoli Boukreev, the professionals have been portrayed well by the actors. The movie does seem sluggish around Rob's plight and also lacks a concise or detailed plot but still recommended for every mountain lover ..."

" Good Man vs Nature Film
",2019-01-24 00:00:00,8,"EVEREST tells the true story of a group of climbers trapped on Mt Everest during a severe weather event. I had heard the story before and seen interviews with those involved, and I always found it intriguing. The trailer for this one looked good but I was a little worried that the filmmakers would ruin it. They got a big famous cast and a big budget, so it only seemed natural to me that they would over dramatize things and give it the real Hollywood treatment, which tends to make things worse.But that was not the case here, fortunately. The film was stunningly shot and the story and acting were great. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, the climax was true to life, and I think this may have been Jake Gyllenhaal's best performance yet. Surely it is. No doubt about it. Recommend."

" Action adventure film details the efforts of brave climbers , including exciting and moving mountain-climbing scenes
",2018-10-24 00:00:00,7,"Based on the Incredible True Story set in The Most Dangerous Place On Earth, the highest point on Earth, Himalaya Mountains , as some climbers tackle the climbing the world's first largest mountain, Everest . Â¨Everest"" boasts a stunning cast as Jason Clarke, Josh Brolin, Robin Wright , Jake Gyllenhaal , Sam Worthington and Kiera Knightley. This deals with the story of New Zealand's intrepid mountaineer Robert ""Rob"" Edwin Hall : Jason Clarke , who on May 10, 1996, successfully led 19 clients to the summit without a single fatality , but subsequently , things go wrong . Rob Hall together with Scott Fischer: Jake Gyllenhaal , teamed up on a joint expedition . All of them set out to scale a famous and risked mountain to ascend Mount Everest only to come face to face with a relentless fight for survival when they start their final ascent since the peak and descend to the base campament and challenging the harshest conditions and imaginable odds .
Nice film with spectacular scenes , snowbound , thrills , emotion , a lot of ropes ,and piolets ; and , of course , fight for life in which at the end, a furious blizzard struck and they have to survive at whatever means , facing off blistering winds and freezing temperatures . Beautiful Nepal scenary fails to totally compensate for a number of slow-moving scenes . Each person's true nature is revealed as they scale the peak , which many climbers have defied and failed in previous attempts, but , finally the two teams must endure in an epic battle to survive against nearly impossible risks . The trip to scale the first highest peak involves a long palaver among them , and much parley between persons of different countries , cultures or level of sophistication . As the climbers argue with other partners , porters , challenges from old rivals and beyond the cliche dialogue . As the main issue results to be a violent storm strikes the mountain, engulfing the adventurers in one of the fiercest blizzards ever , as they suffer several dangers , in which the climbers encounter innumerable odds along the way , including an ascent of sheer rock face , an avalanche and a fall down perpendicular mountain ice . Protagonists give good acting delivering philosophical debating , at times .The main cast and support cast are pretty good , full of known actors as John Hawkes , Emily Watson , Sam Worthington , Keira Knightley ,Vanessa Kirby , Clive Standen , Robin Wright , Naoko Mori , Elizabeth Debicki , Michael Kelly , among others . The film is frankly well ; however, slightly overwrought ,with several dreary lapses , but exciting and stirring .This one belongs to Â¨Climbling SubgenreÂ¨ with important films such as "" The White Tower"" with Glenn Ford , Claude Rains , "" The Eiger sanction"" with Clint Eastwood, George Kennedy, Jack Cassidy and ""K2Â¨by Frank Roddan with Matt Craven , Michael Biehn and Julia Nickson .It contains a sensitive as well as thrilling musical score by Dario Marianelli .

It was actually shot on location in South Base Camp, Mount Everest, Nepal , Tenzing-Hillary Airport, Lukla, Nepal ,Namche Bazaar, Kathmandu , Nepal and Val Senales, Trentino-Alto Adige, Italy . The motion picture was well directed by Baltasar Kormakur whose intention is made clear early on : the hard climbing and the omnipotence of nature as metaphor , as well as a sour denounce on the increasing demand for expeditions to Everest, being based on real events . Baltasar who was born in Reykjavik, Iceland , he is a writer/Producer/filmmaker, an artisan who has directed a number of decent movies of all kinds of genres .

" ...Ehh
",2018-10-12 00:00:00,5,"I was the only one interested in watching this yet at the end they all joined me in being bored. Interesting premise but somehow it managed to turn out boring, how? I don't know. Anyways the best but definitely could have been worse."
" We need more O
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,6,A visualy stunning disaster movie. The first half is pretty entertaining but from there it just goes down the mountain. The movie feels like they wanted to make a documentary and drama at the same time but it failed to develop. And then there are so many characters that after a while you can't even keep track of them and you won't care if they live or die they wanted to give each character a backstory and reason why they are climbing the world's biggest mountain but instead of that they should have focused on Rob Hall and his heroism and how he didn't wanted to leave anyone behind. Oh and Josh Brolin's character got a lot more attention than he deserved. In conclusion it wasn't a bad movie you won't feel like you have wasted 2 hours of your life.
" One of the most boring films ever
",2018-09-18 00:00:00,2,"Tedious, dull to the extreme and completely devoid of tension. Because everyone has a thick beard and wears a big coat, it is impossible to tell what's going on half the time but giving it my best shot it is basically a film where two-dimensional but extremely flawed and ill-prepared climbers go up a mountain, fall down a mountain in a snow storm and then either die or survive while tent flaps blow in the wind at base-camp into the face of concerned supporting cast members. A that's it. I have experienced more excitement watching grass grow next to a freshly painted wall."

The characters largely interchangeable. Also, in the close up scenes the snow covered rock looked like treated fibre glass. However, Kiera Knightly played her climatic telephone scenes very convincingly."
" Giveitarest
",2018-09-12 00:00:00,1,"Apparently someone thought it would be a good idea to make a movie about entitled, privileged white people who think it is a good idea to litter the Earth's wildernesses with polyester, oxygen bottles, and their own dead bodies. At vast expense.Never mind that the only distinguishable character in the whole movie is Aussie /Kiwi Helen, the base camp co-ordinator (I think), whose job it is to express anxiety on the satellite phone when everybody else is wrapped up in garishly-coloured polyester in atrocious weather conditions. Up a mountain, in case you hadn't guessed.Completely overblown Euro-soundtrack, and ridiculous visual effects whose only effect is to indicate that the danger is a simulation: if you film a snow bridge from every angle possible it simply indicates that what you're filming is make-believe. And to call the people in this movie 'characters' is an insult to table football mannequins.Nothing heroic about this at all. Completely stupid, stupid, stupid. With Aussie OR Kiwi accents, which doesn't help."

",2018-08-05 00:00:00,6,"The plot is interesting and well paced, but thats about it.Problems: 1.) There are large periods of boredom in the film. 2.) There is no central protagonist who we are supposed to root for. This is due to a lack of development which should be used instead of the all too frequent long shots of the mountain. As a result, we dont feel much emotion when they die. 3.) The action sequences are too predictable and not very exciting. Most characters deaths involve them being frozen to death, which that their deaths occur offscreen.In general too predictable, lacks emotion and very boring."
" Great simulation for the actual situation on Everest

" The most dangerous place on earth.
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,7,"No matter how trained you are, you can't win against the nature on its own grounds. When you have passion for something, you naturally want to be best at it. If you are passionate about climbing, your ultimate life goal must be to climb the highest mountain in the world Mount Everest. There are companies to help you achieve that goal. One of those companies is called Adventure Consultants led by highly trained professional Rob Hall (Jason Clarke). The plot of ""Everest"" is based on the true story of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster. This disaster occurred on 10-11 May 1996 killing 8 people including Rob Hall. The story focuses closely on the lives of these mountaineers and their struggles and what it means to climb on Everest. The film was directed and produced by Baltasar KormÃ¡kur. Adapted from Beck Weathers' memoir Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest, ""Everest"" opened on 72nd Venice International Film Festival on 2 September 2015 with a total runtime of 121 minutesUntil the actual climbing, director takes your hand and walks you through the film explaining what is going to happen. Dead bodies and blood vomiting people are just the visual proofs of the expected. Human body is not built to climb on Everest. That's why achieving this, makes it so special. The strong point of the film is that, it is not focusing only on the disaster but also the lives of the mountaineers from camping to climbing. We get to learn a thing or two about climbing. A couple of times you witness the greatness of the mountain through the eyes of the mountaineers and through the information provided to us. The director literally prepares you for the film. The perception of the tragedy depends heavily on the transmitting of this early message. Because how audience will perceive the rest, is based on this early tour and director makes sure that, his warnings are heard loud and clear.The visual effects are breathtaking because you are watching a film about the highest mountain in the world. Even though it is a disaster film, you get to enjoy the scenery pretty much. This is the reason why ""Everest"" was released on 3D and 3D IMAX. It must have been a real pleasure to watch ""Everest"" in the cinema but it still managed to give me chills while I was watching it at home. I literally felt cold while watching the film. This made me anticipate how those mountaineers must have felt during the disaster. This feeling made me live the film and eventually enjoy it. ""Everest's"" ultimate goal is not to deliver a message but to help you understand the greatness of the tragedy. This is what the film aims for and it is successful.The tragedy is real but the conversations and the struggles of the mountaineers are added up in the story. That's why real-life actions of the mountaineers are not open for discussion. To judge the actions of those characters, you need to be fully aware of their circumstances. Rob Hall dies making a huge mistake by listening to his feelings. One of his customers, Doug (John Hawkes) is climbing slowly behind the group. While Rob makes the summit and turning back, he meets Doug and Doug insists to go up because he came all the way until there and he will not be coming back again next year. Also, he has already failed 3 times to reach the summit. Rob accepts his wish and climbs back to the summit with him which eventually causes both deaths. So, I was mentioning earlier that, Rob is a professional climber who wouldn't make such a mistake under these conditions and we are not sure if this is really the reason why he died. That's why the actions in the film are not very much open for discussion.In ""Everest,"" there is no place for feelings. It shares the coldness of the mountain. This is the weakest point of the film. Director doesn't focus on the humane part of the plot too much. He is just telling the story and gets it over with. Even the conversations between Rob and his pregnant wife Jan (Keira Knightley) are superficial and not real enough as intended. The director could have worked a little bit more on that. It is a good thing that he shows the real pictures of those people at the end of the film, and in my opinion, that is the saddest part of ""Everest."" With its tragic story and beautiful outdoor scenes -except the dead people around- ""Everest"" is a nice biographical adventure film."
" Could have been better.
",2018-06-26 00:00:00,6,"There were a number of excellent actors in this film and it was a very good story to make into a film. I ultimately found that, despite the dramatic real life story, the film missed opportunities to push for a very viseral experience. There were moments that certainly could have and should have been more drawn out to give the viewer a truer experience to what the real life story was based on. The film is certainly worth watching, but it is not one that I would return to for another viewing."
" A mistake
",2018-04-20 00:00:00,3,In the starting minutes of the movie(6:07) a music which is played is released in 2001 and according to movie its 30th march 1996. So how it can be played. A big mistake to notice.
" Everest - review, 6/10
",2018-04-15 00:00:00,6,"Everest is based on the true story of Robert Hall and Scott Fischer's expedition to the summit of Mount Everest. It's a premise that suggests an emotional character-driven story of two men braving the elements as the ascend Everest. Unfortunately, the movie never reaches the dizzying heights that its title suggests.There are some elements of the movie that do really well; the majesty of Everest is excellently captured with beautiful aerial shots and visceral down-to-earth shots of the climbers which convey the lethality of Everest, imbuing the movie with a sense of tension throughout. However, this effect is severely diminished by the lack of characterisation that is the movie's greatest flaw.Primarily suffering from a lack of focus, it attempts to introduce the characters of all those involved in the real life expedition, perhaps this was as a homage to them and their families but it stopped the movie having a clear protagonist. Additionally, the development that these characters get is very, very limited. It may be that the adherence source material was the downfall of this movie as there is a distinct lack of any character arcs.As such, emotional moments are scarce. Despite the many on-screen tears, you will be hard-pressed to find yourself feeling for these climbers you barely know no matter how well-acted they are (and they are, Jason Clarke as Rob Hall stands out). Thinking on it, I can only recall the one scene which really struck a chord with me (once again, sold very well by Clarke) but, on the whole, I was apathetic to the plight of the climbers. Do not expect this movie to blow you away with a story about people and their attempt to conquer Mount Everest, it settles for being a half-baked disaster movie that spends a lot of time building itself up only to sabotage its own potential with poor development of the cast."
" A reminder of our silliness
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,3,"This film chronicles the events of a particularly bad year for fatalities among the largely white, upper-middle class cohort who actualise themselves by climbing high things. 
It's a hard story to tell. These days, Everest climbers aren't adventurers, they're suburban thrill seekers laying out large amounts of money to traipse all over a pristine and eminently hostile landscape, leaving their poop and beer bottles behind. Notwithstanding the meagre contribution they may make to the local economy, they're basically suicidally self-indulgent. 
Making matters worse, this film has a tonne of characters, played by a terrific cast, all of whom are indistinguishable in their puffer vests and in pelting snow. 
Our ill-fated crew set out to summit, competing with scores of other climbers from across the globe, all desperate for the high altitude selfie. Between the human traffic jam they create, and the sudden onset of a devastating storm, the story becomes a race for survival in which all men (and one woman) have to face off against, you guessed it, 'the mountain'. 
I'm sorry for the losses that occur on Everest, and this movie is a terrific reminder of how easy those deaths would be to avoid. 
What this movie isn't, is particularly good. The mountain scenes look pretty cool but the dialogue is mostly lame, the characters - when you can tell who they are - don't really inspire much empathy. There aren't any villains, but there certainly aren't any heroes either. As for the story itself, it's a fable of how commercialism, self indulgence and stupidity end up littering a mountain with unretrievable bodies that lie as witness to human folly."
" Good to Watch but Expected more
",2018-03-21 00:00:00,7,"Stunning Scenery and awesome mountain scene makes it worth to watch.If I could watch it in the 3D would have been make it super awesome.Characters more or less justify themselves.
 One big mistake, the movie uses a bollywood song which released on 2001 but the story in movie was of 1996. I think the storytelling could be better in this movie."

" A Great Hollywood Movie Disaster
",2018-03-01 00:00:00,2,"No, that's not an error of syntax, 'Movie Disaster' is an entirely fitting epithet for the two hours of bland clichÃ©d drivel that I just subjected myself to.Synopsis:
A group of wealthy, entitled, and in some cases entirely unfit people need to bolster their fragile egos.
In order to do this, they travel to a third world country to climb to the top of the world biggest rock because ... 'reasons'.
The big rock isn't that cool with they idea of having silly little people clambering all over it and leaving their s##t everywhere, so with the help of his friends snow, wind, and ice decides to show them whose boss.Surprisingly ... big rock wins!In Short:
Insipid dialogue.
Stereotypical Hollywoodian characters.
Zero character development.
Obligatory nausea inducing soppy bits.
Total lack of info about why certain key failures happened (read the books).

" Everest is a beautiful disaster.
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,7,"The perfect oxymoron to describe the grandeur of the tallest mountain on Earth, and the tragic expedition that occurred in 1996. Due to the overwhelming number of tourists and expeditions at the time, the camps and ascent were fully occupied. Consequently, this meant certain expeditions were pushed back a few hours. Unfortunately for one held back expedition, a storm arrives that does cause icy chaos for the members. It really is a tragic story. The ambition and determination of humans against the brutality and ferocity of nature. Overcoming gargantuan obstacles that dictate life and death. In terms of the true story formula, it's fairly basic but the tragedy and emotion is delicately conveyed which enhances the compelling narrative. It does take some time to get going, particularly during the first act which showcases Nepalese culture and architecture, however once the ascent commences it pulls you in immediately. The stand out is the frozen landscape. Breathtakingly epic in scale. It's as if Everest is portrayed with its own personality. Harsh, cold and unforgiving. The white snow and icy winds look stunning (4K really enhanced this). The human characters were not developed as much as one would expect, yet during the final act you connect with them. Heartbreakingly tragic, especially between Rob and his wife over a phone call. Jason Clarke and Josh Brolin really owned the film, extremely understated performances. Emily Watson and Keira Knightley bring on the tears. Any deaths that do occur do not feel overly Hollywood, it just happens. Frozen solid, falling off the mountain edge...it's hauntingly realistic. That in itself is frightening. There is a harsh exterior to Everest, gradually though the film melts and reveals a heartwarming sad tragedy that will leave you silenced in its conclusion."
" Based on true events but flawed
",2018-02-24 00:00:00,6,"Everest tells the story that was based upon true events in which happened in 1996 when a group of mountain climbers decided to climb Mount Everest. Everest is worth watching and the actors portrayed by the real people are accurate in description as well as the other details. Overall, the story is interesting though at times, the film becomes dragged on and some parts could have been more suspenseful and thrilling. The film is quite generic in style and none of the characters somewhat stand out, though it is expected."
" Excellent Movie About How Fragile (And Futile) Life Can Be
",2018-01-10 00:00:00,9,"This is an awesome film, so severe, so dooming, so palpable, so menacing. And it sends one and a very clear message - the Nature is too tough to trifle with, it is too violent, too wild, too unpredictable, too huge for us to fathem. This enormity of the Everest Mount, this unbelievably awesome scale, this tremendous size, this humongous altitude diminishes all people and makes them look like tiny tots.
This is a very deep, a bit slow one, but deeply tragic, deeply serious, grave and solemn. It sends chills, it sends vibes, it sends a clear warning - don't mess with Mount. It sawllows people easily. 
I was very freightened after watching this movie, as it is so brutally honest, so horribly shocking, The very sheer volume of the Everest just opnes eyes and shows how unnecessary it is to climb there and die there."
" A solid character-driven survival epic
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"'Everest' is a true survival - man vs nature - film. It's not necessarily fun, but it is engrossing. Since it's based on a true story (I haven't read the 'Into Thin Air' novel), it's a simple plot - in 1996, a group of experienced climbers engage the services of Rob (Clarke) to assist them in their climb to the summit of Earth's highest mountain - Mt Everest in Nepal. The film spends 40min (probably too long) introducing the characters and staying at Base Camp, but it does give you the chance to get to know them and their motivations - especially Beck (Brolin) & Doug (Hawkes).That's the main question throughout - ""why""? I think it boils down to ego - man's desire to conquer everything, even nature's most extreme obstacles - highest mountain, driest desert, deepest ocean trench, outer space, etc. It is nice to see them fulfilling their dreams on making it to the summit, but once the inevitable storm blows in, it really does make you think ""these people are insane for being up there""! I definitely won't be climbing Everest!It's a well-made film, with good pacing once they're climbing and some truly beautiful shots of the Himalayas - very glad they shot a lot of it on-site. The devastating storm is one of the loudest and most ominous things you can imagine when at the top of a mountain. Rob's calls with Jan (Knightley - worst Kiwi accent ever) slow things down, but add to the drama."
" Don't Recommend
",2017-10-27 00:00:00,5,"'EVEREST' - 2015Directed by Baltasar Kormakur{2 Guns; Contraband}Starring Jason Clarke{Dawn of the Planet of the Apes; White House Down}, Josh Brolin{The Goonies; No Country for Old Men} and Josh Hawkes{The Sessions; Winter's Bone}Plot Overview: We follow experienced Mt Everest Climbers, Rob Hall(Jason Clarke) and Scott Fishcer(Jake Gyllenhaal{Brokeback mountain; Nightcrawler}) take a series of mountain climbers to the peak of Everest. But when an unexpected storm strikes, Hall and Fishcer must get their climbers down before it is too late.I am a man whom is VERY fond of films that have been based on a true story. The sometimes horrifying fact that an event actually took place is haunting to me, but immensely intriguing. Thus, I went into this movie with perhaps too high of expectations. Kormakur's movie '2 Guns' ceased to impress me so I should have maybe lowered those expectations. Alas, I believe in second chances so I gave the man a chance. And I was incredibly disappointed. Everest is a dull, boring, monotonous Oscar bait film that I had the displeasure of seeing. Nothing in this film is distinctly amazing, nothing in this movie is distinctly good. But this isn't one of those average movies where you think 'Oh it wasn't too bad; I could still watch it again sometime'. This is one of those average movies that was a chore to get through, not based on quality but based on entertainment value. I didn't expect Jason Clarke to wield a bazooka and rocket jump up the mountain, but the overly long and boring dullness that this film presents, once again, ceased to impress me.Did I like anything in this film though? Yeah. I loved the performances. Not a single actor fails in this movie and they consistently displayed the hardships they're facing and barbaric nature of the event they find themselves in. Two standouts for me are easily the two I initially billed: Jason Clarke and Josh Brolin. Clarke is an actor that I've never took issue with, but has never been blown away by. That is until this movie. Clarke delivers a gut wrenching and harrowing performance as Rob Hall and he was, perhaps unfairly, one of the only two characters I felt a genuine connection to. I think you can guess who the other was. Surprise, surprise - it was the other character in the movie who gave a stand out performance. Josh Brolin is an excellent actor and I truly loved his performance in this film. He is the other character I was even remotely interested in, and that is down to Brolin's excellent performance. Was anyone Oscar worthy? No. But I was definitely fulfilled and pleased with the performances in this film. Another aspect of the film I was impressed by, was the visuals. The cinematography in this movie was excellent, and Kormakur definitely succeeds in enveloping the audience in his cold, calculating blanket of snow and ice. I actually got shivers at certain point from the way Kormakur utilised the camera and visual effects to manufacture a chilling, icy atmosphere of isolation. The editing was also very well done and incredibly concise. Visuals are honestly the greatest praise I can award this movie. Alas, amazing visuals are not enough.I don't think I can call the story of this film weak without possibly offending someone. But in all honestly, I did. As insensitive as this may be to say, I don't think it was that interesting OR a story that needed to be told. Don't get me wrong: it's absolutely horrible was happened on that mountain, and my sympathy forever lies with the families and victims, but I just didn't find the event itself that interesting. I was frequently bored throughout this film. I had little to no interest in what was happening and didn't really care for any of the characters, as cruel as that may be to say.Expanding on that point, films like this rely on the audience feeling sympathy for the characters. But I didn't. The two I did actually care for were the only two that I actually knew something about. They have a little meeting that is designed to give me an insight into their lives, make me care for them and bloat the already overly long run time(seriously, it's 2 hours long but it feels like 4). Alas, all of these goals fail except the last one. I have no interest in that the woman has climbed ""6 of the 7 peaks"" or whatever; I don't know anything about HER, only what she has achieved. It's this unfortunate lack of sympathy that lets this film down for me.As a whole, I was disappointed by 'Everest'. It succeeds in being one of the most mind numbing films I have watched in ages, so credit for that. It has gorgeous visuals and great performances but the disconnect from the situation and characters that I felt made me see no reason in watching it. I didn't like 'Everest' and so I cannot recommend it. I'll rate 'Everest' 5 out of 10."
" Everest (2015) in one word: Heartwrenching
",2017-10-24 00:00:00,8,"I had a pretty good idea of how Everest would play out. I read Krakauer's account of the 1996 tragedy, Into Thin Air, a number of years ago. I could recall the general story- a lot of people die. But, I couldn't remember who died exactly, so some of the story's suspense was preserved for me.However, that suspense is likely to be present regardless of whether or not the viewer knows the details of the story. You almost can't help but be filled with dread as the movie progresses. The cinematography is breathtakingly vertigo-inducing at times, as the camera pivots under and around characters, highlighting the immense depths of chasms and the brutal, potential consequences of a misstep. Early in the film, it becomes evident that there is a problem of overcrowding on the mountain. Everest expeditions are businesses, and ones that seek to all accomplish the same goal in the same brief window, once per year. Rob Hall, played convincingly and endearingly by Jason Clarke, attempts to gather the different companies and work out some sort of solution. The tension between characters in this meeting serves as a precursor to the tension and confusion that will manifest itself near the mountain's summit.There are many characters in Everest, yet I feel that all of them are adequately developed. They are developed to the point that when characters die it is genuinely heartbreaking. The death of expedition leader Rob Hall is particularly moving. In contrast to the deaths of other characters, several of whom simply fall off a ledge, Rob's is not quick. We spend extensive amounts of time with him, as team members and his wife (Keira Knightley) attempt to motivate him to keep him alive and moving. It is watching someone at the very edge of human limits, and it is painful.There has long been debate about the veracity of accounts and depictions of the 1996 Everest expeditions. Krakauer, for one, is not a fan of the way Everest portrays what happened, calling it ""total bull."" It is, however, unlikely that we will ever be able to hash out all the details of the tragedy. Everest is successful in depicting perhaps the most important element of those events in 1996- that many passionate mountaineers, on a mountain that pushes people to limits, found their limits, and lost their lives.More reviews: medium.com/@gavondo"
" a remake of 1997 TV movie Into Thin Air: Death on Everest
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,5,"Im not sure what is the point of remaking a perfectly fine TV movie full of great actors and believable emotions into another same movie where the acting sucks especially with a poor choice of keira k. that looks way too young for that role. What is next? Alive movie? However, I do recommend it for the directors work, cinematography and overall comprehension of the events."
" yet another example of over-exaggerated Western Heroism
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,4,"Who put those ropes in? Who put the ladders across the ice-fall? Who put up those tents they're climbing into? Who carried the oxygen? Who carried the food they're now eating? The Sherpas do that work and that is never shown. The Sherpas did a huge amount of work on this expedition and they were heavily involved in the rescue. There were also Sherpas killed so I think it's yet another example of them being left out of the story, yet another example of over-exaggerated Western Heroism."
" I think Marvel has ruined me
",2017-05-23 00:00:00,6,"I decided to sit down and watch a film that involved a disaster which didn't involve and army of flying robots dropping an entire Eastern European city on the locals while Robert Downey Jr saves the day. I know. I was amazed to find a single disaster movie which couldn't be described like that. However, I came across 'Everest' â€“ a filmed based on an ill-fated expedition to the titular mountain back in the nineties. The team of climbers was left in a pretty bad way after a freak avalanche and what followed was a harrowing tale of human versus the elements as they tried to survive in one of the most inhospitable environments in the world. I have to say that I was quite optimistic. I'd watched similar films in the past like 'Alive' and thoroughly enjoyed them, plus 'Everest' boasted a cast which included Jake Gyllenhaal, Josh Brolin and the latest 'John Connor' from that 'Terminator' movie which no one apart from me liked.However, despite my optimism I was left with a feeling that this film was nothing I hadn't seen before. A team climbs Everest. They get stuck. They have to survive and get back down. I knew that going into the film so I suppose I can hardly claim to be disappointed about what I got, as I got exactly that. No more, no less. Everything about the film can be summed up in a single sentence.I don't know what I was expecting, obviously just more than was on offer. Yes, the actors were predictably sufficient in their respective roles and the scenery (filmed in picturesque mountains with epic views â€“ don't know whether it was technically filmed on Mount Everest or not, but it was suitable to fool a geographical novice like me!) was truly magnificent. However, there just wasn't that much to keep me interested. I know it was a true-to-life story, so they hardly bring in a fleet of alien spaceships with death-rays, but there just wasn't much there to keep me interested.I also have a problem with certain war films where soldiers are basically all dressed alike. I find it quite difficult to tell one actor from another. Here it's a similar problem as they're all wrapped up so tightly to protect themselves against the harsh elements (not to mentions porting full facial beards making identification even harder!) it made telling who's who quite hard sometimes.I certainly didn't hate the film. The quality of acting talent on offer and the great filming locations made it just about worth sitting through. However, when a film can be summed up in one sentence I just feel it doesn't offer (a) much in the way of shocks or surprises or (b) little when it comes to making me want to sit through its two-hour run-time again. Pity, but only the once. Maybe I'm now so brainwashed by Marvel-style movies that I can't appreciate a film that doesn't involve Optimus Prime smashing his way through New York with a battleaxe for an arm."
" Thrilling but not enough depth
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,8,"The movie is a sad story of the disaster than took place on an Everest expedition of a adventure guide group of about 20 people. The movie does a good job of highlighting the thrill, the motivation of those who dare to venture and the dangers associated therein.The dialogues are few. The one I would have liked more on was the motivation part. Would have liked to get into the minds of these people, being an amateur enthusiast myself. It is hard to make out from movie if it tries to make any point. Perhaps it does not. It just present the drama of the disaster without any life lessons one might be looking for.I found the movie lacking a bit in terms of depth. Was hard for me to feel the sorrow at the happening of disaster, and I am emotional one."
" ""Everest"" to inspire you to climb your own mountain
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,8,"Snow flurries pierce your face as you lie on the frigid snow. Your hands and feet are frozen solid along with the oxygen tank at your side. As your body starts succumbing to frostbite, you remember that you are not 26,000 feet in the air on the slopes of the tallest mountain in the world. You're in a movie theater, the air conditioning is turned up a bit and you're almost out of popcorn.""Everest"" is a visual and emotional roller coaster that retells the fight for survival of several climbers during the 1996 Mount Everest tragedy. The story follows two expeditions, one led by Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) and the other by Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal), and the storm that took the lives of five climbers from the two teams.Rob is a kind-hearted, sympathetic guide who helps pioneer the idea of giving amateur climbers the opportunity of a lifetime. Scott is more carefree and rebellious. His philosophy is that if you can't make it up the mountain by yourself, you shouldn't be on the mountain at all.The film's performances are one of its shining qualities. While no one stands out, Clarke, Gyllenhaal, Josh Brolin, Keira Knightly, Sam Worthington, John Hawkes and the rest of the cast deliver several tear-jerking scenes in the movie's two hour run time. The portrayals make you care about the characters. You root for Rob and his team because of Clarke's embodiment of a good man, wanting to get home to his wife (Knightly) and his soon to be born child.While the characters themselves are played superbly, there's very little development of these characters, and they are placed in an uninteresting story. The movie plays out exactly how you think it will. Tragedy strikes and people die. There's nothing in the narrative that sets it apart from disaster movies that have come before it, and thankfully the story was not the focal point of ""Everest.""""Human beings simply aren't built to function at the cruising altitudes of a seven-forty-seven,"" Rob tells his team at the beginning of the film, and it's not until they reach what is called the ""death zone"" that his statement begins to sink in.The tension builds as the air thins, and each crunch of a footstep has you antsy for a potential avalanche, and for the perfect storm you know is coming. Baltasar Kormakur's direction and Salvatore Totino's cinematography envelop you in the icy drama, elevating the experience of the movie and overshadowing its bland narrative.Over 200 bodies lay frozen on Mount Everest's slopes today that serve as a reminder for climbers of the price they may pay when pursuing such a feat. For most that set out to reach the summit however, the risk is worth the reward, and the reward comes in various shapes and sizes.It's the final destination for professional climbers, the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance of their careers. For others like ""Everest's"" Doug Hansen, the reward is found in following one's dreams and inspiring others in the process.You don't have to climb a mountain to stand on top of the world. Whether it's starting your own business, writing a novel or becoming a professional athlete, we all have big dreams and should go the distance to make those dreams a reality. Brian Blessed said it best, ""You can't call it an adventure unless it's tinged with danger. The greatest danger in life, though, is not taking the adventure at all. To have the objective of a life of ease is death. I think we've all got to go after our own Everest."""
" Disappointing
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,6,"No characters to really latch on to apart from Jason Clarke's and admittedly I am only halfway through it, it is boring me to tears. All it has managed to do is point out the futility of mountaineering ( especially climbing challenges like Everest). I guess it is something of an obsession for those who do it. The film is well made and has great cinematography but , no pun intended , it leaves me cold. I just cannot wait to the movie to end. A waste of resources and an excellent cast."
" Want To Climb Mount Everest? Think Again!
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,8,"This is a retelling of the story of two mountain-climbing teams who climb to the summit of Mount Everest in May 1996, when there is supposed to be ideal weather...and even then, it is dangerous. Why does everybody go? A Japanese woman has already climbed the Earth's other six major peaks, some media people want news stories, one man is sent by the primary school he taught at, another battles depression he only escapes by climbing mountains. The movie describes that in the past, one out of four people who make the climb perished in the attempt, but in 1992 someone decides to set up a system of camps and site employees including Sherpas to make it easier for less-expert climbers to make the attempt. But even installing ladders and ropes to bridge crevices to decrease the danger does not make the climb safe.Indeed, you don't need to see the movie in IMAX to see how utterly dangerous it is to climb mountains; the visuals and topnotch performances by all the actors do an excellent job in proving this. The staff at the Everest base camp tell everyone who comes just what sorts of hazards climbers can face, but most of the people still choose to go on, with few turning back. The sad part is how some of the people leave wives and families behind.If the movie does nothing else, hopefully it proves to people just what a crazy stunt climbing such a high mountain really is."
" Exactly What You Would Expect (For Better Or Worse)
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,6,"Right now, take a minute and think about what you would expect from a movie like ""Everest"". Have that thought in your head? Well, that is exactly what ""Everest"" is...no more, no less.For a basic plot summary, ""Everest"" tells the story (based on real-life experiences) of a group of climbers attempting to ascend to the mountain's summit in 1996. The problem that year, however, was that there was more traffic than ever before at the base of the mountain. Seemingly everyone wanted to make that climb on a single weekend. As such, the groups led by Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) & Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) decide to team up in order to reduce traffic and increase the likelihood of success. What they don't count on? A terrific storm that whips up and threatens every single climber on the mountain.First and foremost, ""Everest"" is very much a traditional ""based on a true story"" survival type of film. All the typical beats, characters, and situations you've seen in disaster movies are all present and accounted for. Not until the last 30 minutes or so does it really produce anything unique or off the beaten path. Depending on your point of view, this could raise or lower the overall star ranking quite a bit. I went into the movie not knowing what to expect, and just by personal preference was a bit disappointed in that I like films that stretch storytelling boundaries a bit. This film doesn't do that (mainly through no fault of its own, as it is based on a true story), so just as long as you know that going in you'll know what you are in for.Besides being relatively ""paint by numbers"" in terms of storytelling, ""Everest"" does enough things right for even someone like me to still get something out of the experience. The visuals are stunning, the acting is well done, and those last 30 or so minutes provide some legitimate unexpected moments and emotional material.What it comes down to with ""Everest"", then, is that your enjoyment will almost wholly be based on your expectations and what type of movie you like. If you love ""true stories"" and survival tales, this one is for you. If you (like me) are looking for a bit more dramatized plots and originality in technique, you might be a little disappointed. Again, the film can only ""be what it can be"", obviously, so that is why your mindset going in may just determine the star ranking coming out."
" Splendid mountaineering thriller is the best of its type
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,8,"Having just watched the mountaineering thriller EVEREST, I can report that it's the best-ever film I've seen detailing the subject matter, a mini classic of a movie that blows away memories of the similarly-themed WHITE TOWER (the old '50s effort with Glenn Ford that now seems woefully dated) and the slightly cheesy VERTICAL LIMIT. In addition, EVEREST has the hook of being based on a true story that took place in the 1990s, adding to the realism which is top notch throughout.The plot ingredients of this film are familiar yet it all works and that's because they gel together very nicely. A huge bunch of characters decide to ascend Mount Everest just when a massive storm is due to hit. There's the usual gamut of back stories, rescue attempts, and back-home characterisation, and it's all thoroughly involving. The characters work well because of the ensemble cast; these are real people with no clear-cut heroes and villains, just people driven for whatever reasons.The likes of Jason Clarke and Josh Brolin give performances among the best of their careers when they play down-to-earth guys like these. The sentimentalism is kept at bay which I appreciated. The CGI effects are splendid because you don't notice them - the whole thing is authentic from the outset. Icelandic director Baltasar Kormakur uses his old directorial tricks from THE DEEP in really putting you outside in the elements, making you shiver and shake as if you're there in person. It's quite splendid."
" Everest Movie Review
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,7,"Here is a movie about the most dangerous place on earth, and it shows in the movie. If you've ever had the idea to climb Mount Everest, but don't have the money, watch this movie and your mind will change. Let's see what I thought.Synopsis: On the morning of May 10, 1996, climbers from two commercial expeditions start their final ascent toward the summit of Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. With little warning, a violent storm strikes the mountain, engulfing the adventurers in one of the fiercest blizzards ever encountered by man. Challenged by the harshest conditions imaginable, the teams must endure blistering winds and freezing temperatures in an epic battle to survive against nearly impossible odds. Starring: Jason Clarke, Josh Brolin, Jake Gyllenhaal Director: Baltasar KormakurFirst and foremost, let's just say that I would have given the movie an 8 if the pacing of the movie wasn't so slow to begin with. It didn't start picking up until they started to climb to the summit of the mountain. Even then, the movie was still considerably boring.So, right now you're probably wandering why I gave the movie a 7. Well, even if the story was made up it is still a good story. It's a fight for survival against the greatest enemy known to man: Mother Nature. It is the story of human nature vs. Mother Nature. So, yeah, the story is the main reason.The other reason is because of the acting in the movie. I don't care what anyone says, Jason Clarke is a great actor. Then you add in the likes of Brolin, Gyllenhaal, John Hawkes, Same Worthington, and even Kiera Knightly you have one hell of a cast. There is no doubt about that.I know I didn't talk much about this movie, but give it a chance. It may surprise you.Rating: 7 out of 10"
" Perhaps a version of 1996 Everest tragedy. Good movie
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,6,"This film is based on 1996 Mount Everest disaster. It doesn't completely cover it, and tells the story of two main expedition teams who got involved in it. It can't be said to be a ""true story"". It can't be said to be a filmed inspired from the tragedy. It is like something that goes in between these two. Perhaps we can say it does not cover the tragedy completely but do give us the feeling â€“ the feeling of grief and you may be engulfed in that grief cloud for a couple of days. In the initial parts, we get to see some parts of Nepal (other than the ice-capped Himalayas) but then we would get too involved in getting to know the characters that we would literally pay no attention to it. Also once we get to see the majestic mountains, new characters again get into picture, as we keep registering in our brains as to who is who, we totally forget the mountains. There aren't many shots showing the natural beauty around or any shot (long enough,) for us to gape at the beauty of the majestic mountains. But once the real mountaineering begins, one can't help but appreciate the way it has been filmed, Simply awesome. Action scenes are good, and there is no exaggeration. There is a scene where Beck Weathers falls off a ladder. This gives a small glance as to how things can go wrong. However, just the walking pace of the climbers is enough to let the audience know what the mountain can do to you. Once the descent starts, the story becomes mostly about Rob Hall (or Adventure Consultants). The other characters could have also been portrayed a bit more like in the beginning of the movie where we get a peek onto why each one is planning to summit and also an introduction to Weathers family. Same could have been done in the end too and also some thing of the Mountain Madness clients. You can't fit everything into 2 hours, I guess. When the disaster strikes, you do get a feeling that you are up there grasping for breath. Some scenes do get us into questioning some of the decisions taken by the characters, but then its all explained in the beginning, ""Its not called the Death Zone for nothing"". If you feel grief stricken and it doesn't go away after a few days, just watch the movie again. The second time you would be drawing your attention towards other things, like South Col, Balcony, Hillary Step and of course, who is who under their masks (it's a tough job. I guess they removed their masks at summit just to show us who is who!!). Again, if you are interested you can google on 1996 Everest Disaster and find out that the whole thing hasn't gotten into the movie. Also, reading Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air. But if you are reading it, then make sure you read Anatoli Boukreev's The Climb and you get to see the whole thing from another angle. Whatever we research on, we will never be able to know for sure what all happened on that fateful day. So its best to think of it as a version of the 1996 Everest tragedy and try to enjoy it as just another movie."
" Boring and Annoying (possible spoiler alert)
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,1,"Couldn't wait for this movie to be over and had zero sympathy for these fools that put their lives at risk to climb a mountain. The Brolin character claimed that he was bored when at home but felt alive when climbing. Later admitted when on the mountain that he had eyesight problems. Real smart guy. Duh. Was the loss of his hands and nose worth it? Think of the self created anguish through which they put their families. Like skiers, who venture into dangerous territory after being warned of an avalanche risk, relatives ask the authorities to put others at risk to save these macho idiots.I'm reminded of a movie that I saw years ago about two Austrians attempting to scale the north face of the Matterhorn. Near the end of the movie one of them was hanging helplessly from a rope shouting that he didn't want to die (which he did). Thought about that a little late didn't he! Totally boring."
