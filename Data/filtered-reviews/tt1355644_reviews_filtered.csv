" Thought provoking
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,7,Movie throws interesting philosophical and moral questions. Chris Pratt was the weakest link. A method actor would have done the role justice.
" Great movie
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,10,"I loved the story, the atmospheres, the music, the lights. All so modern but cozy at the same time. Great movie, I've seen it 3 times already and I don't get tired because J. Lawrence and Ch. Prat did such an excellent job. Bravo !"
" Enjoyable if you don't think about it too much, actually at all.
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,6,"The set designs were outstanding. Even with CGI and modern effects I was wondering how they made this look so realistic. The storyline went in the opposite direction. So many absurdities, suspension of disbelief is tested beyond its limits. He has to scan his wrist bracelet to get coffee but can't even afford cream. Just black coffee. But he goes into a bar and is served unlimited whiskey with no scanning of the bracelet or mention of costs. Maybe he bought an unlimited liquor package but rock bottom breakfasts? Then he makes a $6000 voice message to Earth with no problem, so why can't he get cream in his coffee? Seriously. That's just one example of dozens of absurd storylines. They get much worse. On top of that, The movie felt like a very dark, sinister plot that somehow got sugar-coated to death. I still gave it 6 stars merely for the look of the sets and the acting was fine."
" It's life Jim. A life of loneliness!
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,7,"'Passengers' is a Sci Fi romance about a spaceship travelling across the galaxy to a new home planet.
The ship carries many people all in Hyper sleep as they take the long journey.
Unfortunately for Chris Pratt's character he awakens too early.
Ninety years too early!
When Jim (Pratt) realises his sleeping pod has malfunctioned, there's no way to go back into Hyper sleep. It's life Jim, a life of loneliness!
Help is decades away.
Jim succumbs to the suicidal fact that he will live a life of solitude as he travels across the stars.
That is until a young woman who peacefully sleeps in her pod catches Jim's attention.
Jim becomes infatuated with the woman played by the gorgeous Jennifer Lawrence.
He toys with the idea of waking her up and so the story unfolds.
The chemistry between Pratt and Lawrence is what carries this movie. For all the money that is thrown onscreen it is the two captivating performances by the movies leads that steal the show.
Martin Sheen's support as an android bartender is also very welcome. The Shining being heavily referenced here.
There's also stellar support from Laurence Fishburne as one of the Ships main crew who also prematurely awakens.
That being said, the special effects are still very good in this film. Money well spent.
A particular scene involving artificial gravity failure and a swimming pool is most inventive.'Passengers' is a visually stunning movie.
One that looks splendid in 4K.
It's a crisp digital image. Grain free and packed with detail.
Colours pop and the excellent CGI shines due to the impressive HDR.
This is a demo worthy movie in terms of picture quality. I streamed the movie via Amazon Prime.
I can only imagine how fantastic the UHD Blu-ray will look.
Sound design is also a winner. I only experienced the sound mix in Dolby Digital Plus but was still rocked by the tremendous low frequency effects.
When the meteor hits the ship at the beginning I was blown away by how deep the bass gets.
So much so that my Monitor Audio Subwoofer developed a nasty rattle.
Surround sound effects are great, immersive and clear. Dialogue is always audible.
The uncompressed object based audio mix on the Blu-ray will be even better.I enjoyed 'Passengers' it's not your typical Sci-Fi fodder but one that has something for everyone to enjoy."
" Starts here...
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,7,"Everything is about a journey from planet earth to another where passengers will seek a new life, a new challenge. The company or travel agency, to be more precise, provides this service which includes transportation in an ultra modern ship, with various social classes departments, depending on the ""ticket price.""
It takes 120 years to reach the final destination, but everything is centered when one of the passengers wakes up 90 years earlier and, even more so when he is tired of being a year practically alone, so decides to put his heart in front of reason and wakes up another.
The most interesting part starts here..."
" Fantastic movie
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,9,"If only it had Wall-e in, it would get the tenth star."
" Great movie and performances!
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,8,"Finally watched this movie, and I even regret not seeing it at the theatres back in 2016, would have been amazing to see the stunning visuals on the big screen. But anyway I don't understand why it got negativity as a lot have mentioned in the reviews here, best to avoid the criticism.
The movie was enjoyable to watch, original idea that makes you question what the character did but also see why he did it! and such a great performance by Jen Lawrence and Chris Pratt, definitely one of Pratt's underrated performances!
and last but not least, those gravity loss scenes were just so stunning and well shot!"
" 100% garbage.
",2021-02-26 00:00:00,1,All you people who gave this a good rating - I will never forgive you. Corny schmaltzy total garbage. Not one believable second. Hammy acting. Stupid plot. Why did they bother? Don't waste your time.
" Thrilling and engaging story
",2021-02-26 00:00:00,10,"This sci-fi movie has outdone itself. Outstanding visual effects transport the audience into the film, feeling like you are taking part in it. At certain points it involves you so much that makes you think of what you would have done if you were there. Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt's acting is very effective and empathetic - even if the plot of the story might not seem that realistic. The portentous soundtrack goes along well with the space setting.
Overall 'Passengers' is a great movie, worth and pleasing to watch particularly recommended to people who love action and science."
" Cast away in space
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,7,"Was skeptic at first but after watching it I found it quite enjoyable. Considering for the majority of the film there are only 4 actors in it. Action, suspense and romance all set in one ship.
Cast away and Armageddon rolled into 1. Quite enjoyable."
" Best scifi in a decade
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,10,Seems like stay at home during Covid lockdown:-) Humans need social contact
" Underrated
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,9,"This movie is visual stunning.
The plot is also good, but at some point in the middle it gets a little too much. Especially the love story is just long and dreary."
" Wow, that was genuinely amazing
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,8,"I'm not a fan of sci-fi films at all but this was so so good. The acting from both Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence was amazing to watch, they worked perfectly together, that's some great casting. This film genuinely had me feeling emotions and that never happens when watching films, so there's marks for that. Great film with a great ending you genuinely can't complain."
" Underrated Sci-Fi / Romance
",2021-02-19 00:00:00,7,"Really enjoyed this. It has plenty to entertain die hard sci-fi fans, but is also a perfect film for couples as there is a great story too. I was surprised how this seemed to slip under the radar as it has a great supporting cast too."
" Intriguing conception.
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,9,"Passengers is a likeable movie, very well produced with interesting sets and a good storyline. Yes, it is slightly simplistic in the grand scale of things, but it does show humanity in a uncomplicated approach. The main character Jim {played by Chris Pratt} has to deal with loneliness, being the only human alive/awake aboard ship. At first all seems an exciting prospect, he can do what ever he pleases, from the ridiculous {disco dance game} to enjoying the finest food available, and why not take a spacewalk for the hell of it. At this stage his only real ""company"" is the android bartender, played excellently by Michael Sheen. But without a real human around, his mood obviously starts to go down hill rapidly. So he wakes one of the other passengers, a woman called Aurora {played by Jennifer Lawrence}, and so the story unfolds of man meets woman, they become friends then lovers and so on. And just as humans are, the relationship hits the wall, and bitterness descends and the predictable ""break up"" results. {The reasons for this, well you will just have to watch the film}. As the storyline begins to reach its climax and purpose, the solution is a little too facile for me, and it let the film down a bit. However, it is a good film. Had the main character not awoke as he did, then the ship would have been destroyed; so the result of his actions relating to Aurora are justified. The way that the conclusion of this bond between Jim and Aurora plays out is, in my mind, rather well written and very fitting to the story. The final scene as the door opens is again a little too farcical, but, hey. this is just a movie. Enjoy!"
" An absurd attempt
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,5,"This movie was completely ridiculous, the science in this movie was nonexistent. Slingshotting an enormous ship around a molten star, as hot as our sun within tens of thousands of miles?There were so many leaps of faith that this movie required, the chase scene at the end where she's trying to retrieve him from outer space? So many aspects of this movie were so beyond implausible, that only children or people willing to take an enormous leap of faith would feel comfortable buying into the story. It had potential, the production was amazing, the two leads were good, they just didn't have much to work with.This my second time viewing the movie and I was hoping that I might be more accepting, and tolerant, but I couldn't muster up any of that. Ridiculous and cheesy is what comes to mind."
" Tedious paean to the perfection of rich, pretty white women
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,5,"The first 20 minutes is pretty decent, with Chris Pratt turning in a credible solid solo performance as a flawed, vulnerable, lonely space-castaway.Then it all goes to pot when the chubby smut girl joins the film.The essential problem is that her character is hollow and flawless, and the chubby smut girl plays it as such, without any depth or nuance at all. She's nothing more than a perfect-pretty-space-wamxn, with a now worthless skill. And Pratt panders to the smut girl by immediately adopting a subservient, simpering role.And that's what we get for the rest of the movie. All that matters is the chubby smut girl's safety, and her selfish feelings. The men in the film just react to her, grovelling and cucking and protecting and apologising, telling her that she's so pretty and so clever and so morally right, desperately seeking validation via her attention and approval.This is a film made to appeal to weak women, and weaker men."
" Really enjoy watching !!!
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,9,"Just enjoy the film, do not bother on the sci-fi stuff of future world.."
" Wow - this was great!
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,8,"I, like everyone else, listened too much to the critics, but the teaser trailers didn't do this movie any favors either.There is a dark undertone to this movie, but watching the relationship develop between these two was beautiful. The acting is top notch, very believable actions and decisions, and the ending really pays off and sticks the landing. I was invested all the way through. Great visuals, and a haunting soundtrack.I wish I would have seen this in the theater, it it worthy of a theatrical view - great movie."
" I was so excited for this story, but...
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,2,"I was so excited when I heard about this movie- a love story set on a generation ship, 2 people woken from suspended animation too soon! Also that spaceship is beautiful and the actors are too. This seemed like a really creative story, and I mean, it is- but I still couldn't enjoy it because the ""love story"" was actually extremely creepy- it's a very one sided and misogynistic romance and that plot really ruins the movie. If they had them both woken up by accident it would have been much better, but as it is it's just a guy being creepy and getting away with it, he ruined her life. I'm very disappointed in this, it could have been so good."
" Excellent!
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,9,"I preface my comments by first saying I'm a sucker for this genre, I can't get enough of it! If you're like me than I think you'll enjoy this film. It's a great story with exceptional visuals & casted very well."
" Robinson Crusoe meets Sleeping Beauty
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,9,"I'd not read any professional reviews of Passengers. I rarely do read them. Professional film critics are looking for different things from your average film-lover, and when they don't find them, or don't approve of where they find them, their egos lash out.
It's no coincidence I wager, that Jennifer Lawrence's character is named Aurora, after the princess in Sleeping Beauty. I loved this film: its pacing, its look, the design, the romance (with both a big R and a little r), all of it. I wish I'd seen it in the cinema on a huge screen instead of in Prime Video at home, but I'm just glad I've seen it now. I'm buying the BluRay."
" Very pretty film with great special effects and acting
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,7,"Passengers received rather mixed reviews when first released, which I think is a bit unfair. Chris Pratt, Jennifer Lawrence, Laurence Fishburne and Michael Sheen all do well in their roles and there's definitely good chemistry between Lawrence and Pratt. The plot is rather inventive too exploring the ideas of companionship and if you're left alone would and isolated would you take someone along with you even if it too made them isolated, very human decisions.7/10: The film could have been handled in a better way but it's good for what it is and even though some scenes may go on a bit longer than they should it is still a great film"
" It's a beautiful movie.
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,10,This a nice movie. I love how romantic the scenes are. This a underrated movie. People should watch it. It's a feel good and heartwarming story of a passenger.
" Great!
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,9,"A great movie. Good script, good story and acting! Jennifer Lawrence is stunning :)"
" Incredibly underrated!
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,9,"This film was simply.. ugh, just amazing! Such an incredible story, filled with twists, turns and incredibly difficult decisions that force you to wonder ""what would I do.."" Honestly, the only thing I would have changed is the ending credits song. It wasn't strong enough for the ending of such an incredible films So, if that tells you anything.."
" Huge flaw
",2021-01-21 00:00:00,6,This is the 3rd time watching this and This time Felt the urge to just point out the complete obvious. Now Understand movies are movies and Sifi is suppose to not really make full sense. But heres the deal. If they would have just woken up even 3% of the crew or whatever. Then wouldn't that make combined minds prevail sooner?I get they have to make it suspenseful and dramatic but come on.
" Simply breathtaking
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,9,One of the nicest movie I have watched in recent times. I am not sure about the feeling I get every time I watch this movie but it leaves me wanting for more. Loved the acting of both the lead actors and also the message.
" Outstanding Sci-Fi
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,9,"An outstanding human drama based Sci-fi film with two great leads who carry the story with aplomb. It has elements of survival, space travel, romance, tension all rolled together into one engaging film."
" From Decent to Meh
",2021-01-08 00:00:00,5,"Passengers is directed by Morten Tyldum, written by Jon Spaihts and stars Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence. The films tells the story of a dystopian future wherein people from Earth have the opportunity to take a 120 year journey to a different planet for the purpose of colonization. However during one such journey to the planet of Homestead II, a man by the name of Jim is awoken 90 years early due to an error from his hibernation chamber. With his fate seemingly inevitable, Jim is tasked with making difficult decisions. Released during the holiday season of 2016, Passengers was moderately successful and was met with warm audience reception, but was a middling film for a majority of critics.Going into Passengers I was looking forward to it as the trailers did pique my interest due to the concept being compelling, the thought of being the only one awake on a spacecraft that is still years away from its destination is inherently intriguing. After finally watching Passengers, the film is pretty alright; it does some things that I liked and was engaged with however it does include some aspects I was not a fan of. The movie is very entertaining, although the story's structure isn't very unique, I was interested in what was going on the entire time. The first half of the movie is probably where it succeeds the most, seeing the character of Jim maneuver around the empty spacecraft certainly was fun, although the isolation aspect has been done better in other films, it still was entertaining nonetheless. When Jennifer Lawrence's character, Aurora, comes into the picture it creates an interesting dynamic between the pair that wasn't overly romantic or sappy... at least in the first half. The film does a decent job at setting up mystery, that although the end result may be clear cut, the way the film gets from A to B certainly provides the most intrigue.Where the movie starts to fall apart is during its backend, I found the story to sort of fall apart and become ridden with cliches. It's not a horrible direction the film goes in but is definitely a dip in quality. Some other aspects I wasn't the biggest fan of was the acting, it's certainly serviceable but wasn't exactly mind-blowing either. Chris Pratt was the weakest of the two, and once again it felt like he was just playing himself, which detracted from a couple of key moments in the story. Had another actor been casted I think they could have offered a little bit more dramatic of a performance than what we got. Likewise, I found the CGI to be kind of bad and given the budget this film had it's obvious where some funds were allocated to. It's not that the effects were horrible but it was pretty obvious when something was CGI and it never looked that hot.All in all, Passengers had the opportunity to be a pretty good romantic sci-fi film, however, the handling of the story and the direction the third act takes knocks the film down to be an average space movie. Despite this, I did enjoy my time with this film and can recommend it, even if the runtime is felt and isn't that memorable. It's a film with its fair share of highlights and low points and for that reason, I am giving Passengers a 5/10."
" Great premise deftly murdered with hollywood cheese.
",2021-01-07 00:00:00,4,"I would love to see this remade by an intelligent and talented writer.
Decent beginning, with a good idea, but the cheesy corporate, iphone setting, gigantic plot holes, lame writing and terribly cheesy, contrived, sappy last 1/3-1/2 totally destroyed it.
Barely worth a watch."
" A simple rewrite could have saved this film.
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,6,Reverse the roles. Lawrence should have been the engineer that wakes up first.
" The acting!!
",2020-12-28 00:00:00,10,Yes finally something that felt real. These 2 are fantastic together. Best casting ever.
" One Plane, Two People, All the Feelings
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,6,"What was marketed as an ""edge of your seat, Sci-Fi thriller"" was truly just a movie showing how selfish Chris Pratt's character is capable of being.After waking up years ahead of time, Jim Preston wanders around the Avalon ship alone, slowing losing his mind. After years of solitude, he deliberately causes Aurora's pod to malfunction, as he decided from watching her interview that in spite of literally knowing nothing about her, that he was madly in love with her. Aurora is just as confused as Jim is upon waking, and Jim is successful at wooing her (hard to imagine considering he was literally the only man awake there!) until one day, when Jim has planned to propose to Aurora, the robot bartender tells Aurora what actually happened to her pod. Predictably pissed, Aurora ignores Jim, plunging him back into the solitude with only himself to blame and only himself as company.
The Avalon starts to malfunction, with a critical error that could cause the entire ship to explode in space. The captain is woken up due to a genuine malfunction, and together the trio try to fix the ship before the problem kills them. The captain dies rather quickly due to a myriad of health issues that are presumably caused by the malfunction in the pod.Predictably, Jim and Aurora are able to fix the problem, and save the day. Aurora forgives Jim for essentially ruining her life and sentencing her to die on the ship with him and they spend the rest of their life in planting trees and plants around the ship."
" Leave your brain at the door
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,3,"I had been tying to watch this on YouTube but found it mysteriously inaccessible. I tracked down a badly marred DVD at last, to digest. I always knew this was a fluffy popcorn flick but this one makes Lost In Space (1998) feel cerebral in comparison. Despite my copy glitching I could still piece together the plot, or what little there was. After the 1 hour mark Laurence Fishburne appears - must not have gotten enough royalties from Apocalypse Now or Matrix or whatever - assesses the production underway and promptly dies (smart call). Our two heroes - a journalist and washing machine repairman(?) switch up to rocket scientists and inexplicably vent the ship reactor and save the day. And just as well: Andy Garcia was resuscitated, with a full beard, to Captain the ship and collect an undisclosed pay check for a brilliant non-speaking cameo. Consuming your favourite beverage, to your own specified level, helps to appreciate what entertainment level is on offer.Not the worst movie I have ever seen but hardly a recommendation."
" I enjoyed it.
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,5,"I enjoyed this film the first time. Not a masterpiece, which explains why I've never managed to watch it a second time.There's some similarities in the beginning between this movie & Alien Covenant eg.1 On their way to their destination, the ship collides with space debris.
2 The collision damages electrical systems resulting in hibernation pod/s to malfunction.
3 The occupant of the pod is woken up too soon/killed.In passengers they continue to their intended destination. No one else dies due to mindless stupid decisions. Romance in space blah blah. All ends well.In Alien Covenant, they change/divert destination. Many people die. Romance in the air/space since crew is all couples. But, all doesnt end well. Too many stupid characters..."
" Castaway in space
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,9,"Yes it's entertaining and thought provoking. It's not a classic by any means but the production is great, acting is solid and it's a Saturday night movie to enjoy. The music is fabulous from Thomas Newman, great CGI and a well executed storyline. Just enjoy it for what it is and ignore the negative critics."
" A Great Film That People Want to Ignore
",2020-12-10 00:00:00,9,"Don't believe the reviews, but don't go in thinking this is the next Star Wars (the reviewers seemed to think so). No this is not a straight Sci-Fi movie. Watch the trailer and know what it is, a romantic movie set in a Sci-Fi environment. Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt are wonderful to watch and are really good characters. Don't miss this film!"
" Amazing movie, great storyline, and a perfect ending
",2020-11-30 00:00:00,10,"This movie was so good i watched it whole even without touching my phone once. Which is impossible for me. I loved it so much, it kept me always so tense and it didnt dissapoint me."
" Good movie. Lame ending.
",2020-11-26 00:00:00,8,"Good movie, but the end of the movie came suddenly and was lame. It went through 88 years in a couple of minutes without seeing the two main characters. I was very disappointed."
" Space Romance
",2020-11-16 00:00:00,2,Started out with a great idea. Waking up early on a space ship 90 years early. The movie could have taken some great directions and storyline but instead turns into a cliche boy meets girls in space...yawn
" Wake them the hell up!
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,4,"So stupid that Jim wakes up Aurora and not the captain...or anyone who could run the ship. The special effects were amazing, thus a 4 star rating over my initial 2."
" A very good film, which touched me
",2020-11-10 00:00:00,9,"A good story, nice visual effects and absolutely ""spacy"". And with Jennifer Lawrence there is a stunning actress 😍 I absolutely liked watching this film. Sometimes quite stressful."
" Automation
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,8,"I'm a fan of Passengers. Thought provoking, moving, character-driven. I've noticed in a few reviews, the functionality of the ship is questioned since passengers are supposed to be asleep until they reach the planet. The entire ship and it's functions are automated and programmed to turn on when human presence is detected from the moment Jim Preston awakes and is greeted, the entire ship has received notification that humans are now awake. So when he goes to the orientation, his action of walking into the room triggered the pre-programmed orientation. The same with all other functions on the ship. Any special feature on the ship, like identifying a star constellation, would be functioning because human presence was detected."
" I really liked Arthur
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,4,"First, let's get one thing right: this is not a SciFi movie. It's a love story / action film (after a long build up) that happens in space. Thumbs up for the set, the effects, the production design, all of which are great and kept me going. The acting is alright with the exception of Arthur (Martin Sheen) who stands out. The story however is lacking a lot and that's a missed opportunity. Chris Pratt is a mechanic. But how come he knows anything about the ship's tech. He's a passenger, full stop. Aurora is a journalist who goes on a 250 year round trip? Yeah, right. Anyway, I could go on and on but don't want to spoil it for those who haven't watched it. Not the worst film as some reviewers wrote but not the best either. Just okay. And like a hotel review on TripAdvisor, such middle ground is bad."
" Well done!
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,8,"First off, the special effects in this film are fantastic. The design of the Avalon felt real and seemed to match the enormity of what the external spacecraft looked like.While what Jim did was morally wrong and I can understand Aurora's horror when finding out Jim had opened her pod manually, I wonder, what would YOU do if you were Jim? What would YOU do if you were alone for one year and had no one to talk to but Arthur the android? Honestly, this film could have used a scene or two where Jim contemplates or even attempts suicide. If I were in his shoes, I think I would have manually opened up someone's pod as well - maybe even more than one. As Gus states, ""A drowning man will try to drag someone else down with them.""I don't really think the love story element of this film is cliché because honestly, what would be likely to happen if you were the last two people on Earth? I think you would either end up as friends or lovers, or most likely, both. People can say that there is an element of Stockholm syndrome in this film, but I don't buy it.Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt have really strong chemistry together, which goes a long way to making this film work as well as it does.I think the largely negative critical response to this film is unwarranted. It is easy for cynical armchair critics to blather on about how this love story has been told a million times before, but very few of them ruminate on what they would feel or do if they were in Jim or Aurora's shoes."

" This movie have it all...
",2020-10-11 00:00:00,10,"I am 34 years old, divorced for 7 year now, living alone, seeing my children only in weekend, live in terible litle country, long story short... Terible life. Despite the fact that I watched probably to many movies of all genres in my life and pearson whit life like my own probably dont like unrealistic movies and romantic and I dont know... For me this is the best movie I ever watched. I think that this movie have many very strong points and wisdom for every person who can realy put his mind in that story.
It is uniqe story and beutiful yet not too beutiful. It just perfect. I love it and I watched at least 3 times a year when I whant to release the presasure of my reality.
And i think that thinking of AI is very realistic and that in that future whil be just like in the movie. Uncapable to give the answers for what to do in very complicated situations when realy only human can decide what to do... Maybe i like the movie so much becasue i feel like Jim in first year of the storyline. All alone in the universe... Sorry for bad english and negative short story of my life :) that is only to try explain how good is the movie."
" We must be starving..

" Just a couple of questions...
",2020-10-08 00:00:00,7,"The film was nice..Don't read if you have not seen the film!!
My first question is how come they did not make kids.? It's the basic human instinct/ feeling. I would have expected to see a huge family once the other passengers wake up.The second is, wouldn't it be possible to use the hibernation capsule at the medical room in turns? If 85 years were remaining they could split the time in two and arrive at their destination around 70, supposingly that they are around 30 years old in the movie. They could even do turns of 10 years..But ok..Still they would have lived alone with the hope of some years at the new home, being old. But it could have been something!"
" Beautiful!
",2020-10-07 00:00:00,8,"This is one of the few (ET, Inception, Interstellar, Looper... ) sci-fi movies that I actually like enough to re-watch multiple times... and I don't even like this genre. The story is very original, the set and the visual effects are just splendid and reasonable enough to be believable, the acting is superbly done with a very appropriate casts, and the subject matter is very real. All pros and no cons for me in this movie. If you have time, watch it... if you don't have time, make time! LOL!"
" Nice angle on a romance
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,6,Let me say you couldn't make me watch a romance movie if you handed me a winning lottery ticket. So I enjoyed the limited scifi enemy's and the acting. The storyline behind the romance is quite intriguing. An easy watcher with the missus
" Igbore the haters
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,10,"Slick. Fun. Passionate. Believable .Funny. And yes, real sci-fi. Ignore the bad reviews. Yes it's a love story with a sci-fi mix. And THIS is how you do it. I absolutely loved it."
" Dull and ponderous.
",2020-09-22 00:00:00,2,"Having read all the reviews, I decided to give this film a go. It had lavish special effects, but ultimately it was a dull and ponderous movie."
" I loved it
",2020-09-18 00:00:00,8,"This is a top-notch movie. Yes it's science-fiction, but not the ultra realistic type we have got used to of late. At its heart this is a love story played out by two beautiful actors who have terrific chemistry on screen. Very underrated film."
" it's a beautiful story
",2020-09-15 00:00:00,9,"It's touching, grand space views.
Jennifer is gorgeous as usually.
shame to know its box office not so good."
" Brilliant, engaging sci-fi.
",2020-09-11 00:00:00,7,"My Rating : 7/10Very well executed - 'Passengers' will take you on a sci-fi ride without a doubt - adventure, emotion, action, thrills - spectacular setups though minimalist and doesn't require the viewer to be a geek to understand the storyline.Beautiful, well-paced and great leads - science fiction from the heart!Do not miss."
" Great combination of Sci-fi and Romance
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,10,"Don't pay heed to these negative reviews,just watch this epic romance saga if u really love romance genre
From its gorgeous visuals to its beautiful chemistry between the leads it's all just so mesmerizing.
A thumbs up from me"
" Most satisfying film I've seen in years
",2020-09-05 00:00:00,10,"Had seen it advertised but nothing much. I like both actors, but didn't sound like it would work. It does. Hugely. Yes its largely looking in to a future we know nothing about, but I think, based on the weak world we live in now of superficial and materialistic thought, the ship and the ideas presented to us in this movie feel about right. It's fun, thought provoking, the special effects are special and the acting is brilliant. Warm and charming. I loved every minute of this ride."
" Forgettable
",2020-09-05 00:00:00,5,"Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence sell the romance very well. However, the filmmaker creates an uneven tone by leaning too heavily on Pratt and Lawrence's charisma and comedic sensibilities. Overall, Passengers feels superficial."
" So cute
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,8,"I don't really like a romance movie, but this one was really cool, Lawrence and Pratt have incredible chemistry, the script is interesting and the futuristic theme is great to enjoy."
" This could have been a great series
",2020-08-19 00:00:00,5,"I'm going to resume this quickly, if you turn the first hour and something, until Aurora finds what Jim did, or maybe until she starts thinking on what to do with that, and also Jim is doing the same that could have been a great trigger to a Netflix series or something like that, or even a larger movie but with a totally different twist starting on that point, but after that moment everything goes wrong, the movie ends up having no sense at all, and leaves you with the idea that even a good starting point can turn into a really forgettable movie.
All the space travel idea, in the way this movie was talking about was just great, the idea of having some unexpected failures (even if those failures seems to be wrong in some point) on such a long and suspended travel, the automation of most of the systems, and all the questionable decisions from Jim were just great for a movie (or for an outstanding series), even the sex scenes, nothing is wrong with that, but, come on, how this movie could that bad, with that horrible happy ending, and making everything to solve fast, and almost, easy. What a waste, what a waste."
" Brilliant
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,10,I wish i could forget everything and rewatch this masterpiece.
" Really enjoyable movie
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,9,Was expecting a sci-fo movie.Throught the lense of a romance movie with sci-fi sprinkles it is a very enjoyable movie till the end!
" Started strong ... ended with a whimper.
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,9,"After watching the first 10 mins of this movie, I felt like one ... this is gonna be a good one'. For the most part, it is a solid movie. But, the writing falls apart toward the end of the movie. It became predictable and cheesy. Regardless, expect a strong movie for the first 3/4 of the film, and the last 1/4 a ho-hum of an ending."
" Hell of movie! Loved it!!
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,10,"One of the best sci-fi movies ever, didn't know how 2 hrs spent. Just felt like if we're there on the ship.
A must watch for space lovers❤"
" Nice Movie, not so good ending.
",2020-08-02 00:00:00,6,"It is a well done movie based on an interesting premise. However, I did not like the ending. Why did they spend all those years together alone in love? Why didn't they have CHILDREN? This is not a moral issue, but a very practical one. In their situation, having a family would be the most reasonable solution to the problems of loneliness and the question of purpose of life."
" Good romantic sci-fi movie..!!
",2020-08-02 00:00:00,7,"Two of the passengers awaken from space craft early than expected.... Then they fall in love each other and solve the space craft malfunction.
Worth watchable movie..."
" A sci-fi love story that is haunting, if more than a little creepy in its premise
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,5,"In the distant future and 120 miles from Earth, a large starship is returning back to Earth, now named Homestead II. One of the cryogenically frozen passengers (Chris Pratt) wakes 90 years before the ship reaches its destination. After several weeks, lonely and with no hope of returning to sleep, he selects and wakes another passenger (Jennifer Lawrence) for company, but does not tell her it was he who woke her.This big budget sci-fi love story is immensely enjoyable and somewhat haunting and is very good to look at, but is also flawed by its creepy premise of Pratt's character (imagine if his character was an older middle-aged guy). Fishburne's character seems a little wasted and a time filler, though overall the film is fairly satisfying."
" Fantastic, very well done movie
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,9,"I was surprised how good this movie was after seeing only 31% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The story line was PERFECT, it had just the right pace. Nothing felt rushed or prolonged too much. The tension was going up and down but overall following an upward curve until the culmination moment where you could feel pretty well what the characters must have felt.The tech in the movie was also done very well. Just a lot like what we might imagine it should be in the near future when such flight could actually take place. Things just made a lot of sense, nothing felt too cheezy or silly.Also, I didn't realize I liked Jennifer Lawrence so much :)I highly recommend this to any Sci-Fi fans and even those who are not but have open enough mind to simply see a good movie that doesn't go too far yet keeps you very engaged. Just fantastic!"
" SF Romance is odd but it works!
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,7,"Most SF films are about future societies or alien invasion so to have one that's basically a romance is odd but it was very good. Mind you, I could watch Jennifer Lawrence all day and all night. Pratt acted well for the first section when he was alone and his anguish over waking her was realistic. JL is a good actress and did her rage well when the time came. The end crisis and resolution was dramatic. Apart from a slow patch in the middle - the true love bit - a good film well worth watching."
" Very good sci fi and a moving love story.
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,10,"Ignore the bad reviews, this is very good sci fi and a moving love story."
" Sympathy for the devil
",2020-07-16 00:00:00,1,"So, we have a desperate man, so desperate he decides to condemn another person, carefully chosen to fulfill his macho fantasies, to share his burden. This implies killing her or, in the lenient point of view, depriving her from the life she had chosen for herself. But he is oh yes so wonderful and charming, and such a hero, that she is of course irresistibly attracted and lives happily ever after with him. Creepy story."
" Review - Passengers
",2020-07-15 00:00:00,4,"I don't feel that this movie knew what it was trying to achieve.The first 1/3 of the movie is carried by Chris Pratt delivering a very bland performance. The director kept this part very light-hearted and family-friendly being alone on the ship doesn't seem to disturb/trouble him that much. In fact, the only effect that it causes is the growth of his beard.This part was also over-relying on his influences (The Shining).The second 1/3 of the movie, where he develops a love affair with Aurora is roughly speaking a happy-ended Bride of Frankenstein. The character evolves through a series of dull ""Best of..."" moments, it is predictable, and overall this part seems like a missed opportunity.The third 1/3 of the movie turns out to be a very basic ""Oh no, my ship is broken"" movie. The suspense and your emotions are constantly turned off by easy resolutions such as Jim's resurrection Or, the sudden apparition of a crew member without any backstory played by Laurence Fishburne."
" (MPA) film rating system
",2020-07-13 00:00:00,7,"This film isn't PG-13. this is ""R""
Has sexy scenes."
" Great Movie & Thomas Newman Soundtrack
",2020-07-09 00:00:00,10,"A great Movie... I watch it now whenever I am not feeling so well, I have to prepare for something important and relax completely ... Especially the Soundtrack by Thomas Newman is again One of the Best Music Masterpieces I have heard so far... The Scene and the Soundtrack where Jim & Aurora go into Space is just WoooW ... Absolutely look recommendation if you are not so well or you want to relax..."
" Cool movie, abrupt ending though
",2020-07-09 00:00:00,6,"This movie is super interesting and commits well on the emotions involved in loniless and isolation.The ending was super abrupt, I feel like they should've added something else towards the ending instead of just a ""arrive at the planet"" and that's it ending."
" Up there with 2001
",2020-07-08 00:00:00,10,"This is a stunningly brilliantly shot film, akin to that of Oblivion. The sets and special effects are excellent as are the general vistas and long shots. If you like Sci-fi, this is the one for you. Romance, action, sex, a bit more sex and action added with some great acting. It's also a scary film, we all have nightmares of being alone and this pushes that to point of near suicide.There is only other film that makes you think of being alone in space, Dark Star.Whatever the critics thinks, this is a great movie. The ended is sad but bare with it to the end...."
" Boring! Boring! Boring !
",2020-07-07 00:00:00,1,"I think the positive reviews on here are fixed ! This movie is awful . There's the anticipation that something will happen in this movie and it didn't . I didn't think that a movie could ever be irritating but boy was I wrong ! I would have given this movie a score of -0 , if I could ! It's that bad."
" Could have been even better
",2020-07-05 00:00:00,9,This is a great movie and I loved it. Perhaps it could have been even better if they had rearranged the sequence of events. If they had started with Aurora's awakening it would have created a mystery and when she discovered why she had awakened they could have run the preceding events as flashbacks.It's only a minor point though!
" Space Romance
",2020-07-03 00:00:00,10,"While I had low expectations for this I came out incredibly surprised and I can actually say I loved this movie. Yes it's silly and not ultra realistic ""interstellar"" style sci if and it's not trying to be. It's a very simple human story with and interesting dynamic for a possible romance set in a backdrop of silly sci fi. I loved it."
" Amazing!
",2020-07-01 00:00:00,10,Just an amazing plot! A masterpiece but with some mistakes still a really good movie.
" WELL, IT IS ORIGINAL
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,7,"Though the chemistry between Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt is there, there is no denying that, much likr thr spaceship in the movie, ""Paseengers"" is on autopilot."
" Bad
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,3,This movie was very bad. It could have been way better. It said because I have liked both of the main stars
" Passengers
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,8,"Passengers is a truly brilliant movie, it's hard to place it into a genre, but it is very much a sci fi love story. The concept is a great one, and it poses a fabulous question, could you force someone to spend their life with you, or live a solitary life. The idea is very original and very clever, the special effects are breathtaking, and the cinematography is first class. The main trio of actors do a superb job, but it's the dazzling Jennifer Lawrence that stood out for me.Attention to the detail to this film was first rate, huge credit to all those behind the scenes.It's not often the case that I wish a film wouldn't end, but after fifteen minutes or so, I was captivated, and really didn't want it to end."
" Slow slow uuuh.. abs.. ooh girl.. uhm what? ..uhm aaaawh..!
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,4,The script...?sums it up there i think ..in the title!
" Better than I expected
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,7,"It's actually a secure piloted movie , non of the trash of commercial movies ( to a point ) .. having said that it's not going to stay inside you mine for a while ' you will forget about it the moment you finish it .. I thought the change of aurora response to Jim dos not make sense , and that caption character was plane"
" Best science fiction movie
",2020-06-02 00:00:00,9,"I wish I understood why the professional critics of various publications rate this movie so terribly. In a world where Star Wars commands an unprecedented fan base and the subsequent financial windfall, Passengers is a wonderful Romantic Sci Fi film that not only presents a series of life paradigms in an elegant and entertaining manner, but also entertains and lets the imagination fly free of the clutter of over marketization.
Passengers is a carnival of what ifs. It allows one to turn to the one we love and ask the question... ""what would you do if I stranded you in paradise with me for eternity?"" and this conundrum is very well elaborated in this movie. The principal question is, you get to live with no need to work ever again, with all the food, shelter and resources that you will ever need, but you get to be with just one person for the rest of your life, and within the confines of a demarcation.
If you ask me, I would love to be woken in such a situation, even if it meant to lose everything that today I hold dear and near, the only requirement for me is to be woken by someone that will love me more than I love myself.
The effects are what is expected of a big budget modern movie, they are simply superb, the acting is more than I would have expected from Chris Pratt, in fact this movie makes me respect him as a serious actor, and of course Jennifer Lawrence is a delight in every respect of the word. But to me the top acting was that of Michael Sheen, his personification of the most excellent Bartender one could ever hope to find invites you to revisit those days where men were proud to be gentlemen. In a word, invites the common person to be better. Less we all learn to be as great listeners and friends as this portrayed android is, wouldn't the world be a far better place?
By the time of my review, this movie is ""old"" but worry not about investing the time to enjoy it. It forms part of my private collection, a movie that I will enjoy with my daughters when they turn the appropriate age, and then... I will issue the question...what do you think? What would you do?"
" Underrated cool concept movie!
",2020-06-01 00:00:00,10,"Seriously the concept was great the execution was little less at last but whatever the whole movie was amazing ride right from the start,the music was phenomenal so does the soundtracks.the visuals were stunningly beautiful and amazing,the acting was great the chemistry was amazing of the two,love the brief cameo of Lawrence he was amazing and the bartender he's live a little quote was brilliantly amazing,the gravity scene was skeptical and awesome,the ending was amazing with the beautiful nature scene it was amazing,Overall it was visually stunning,cool concept and amazing space-romance entertaining movie!"
" This Movie is why we Love Movies
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,10,"Perfect Sci-Fi love story! 10 Stars all the way. The only downer is that it was not long enough. I could have easily watched another hour, Sequel?"
" Not so great, but okay for killing time when nothing better to do
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,6,"For years I had a different picture what this film is really about. Blame it on the criticis, or the false advertising. Whatever.
So, I accidentally catch it on TV, and was too lazy to change the channel, and honestly, was sucked in the story after 20 minutes.
I gotta say, the first part of the movie is great, deep and thought provoking. Makes your mind wander as what would you do in that situation. Would you die of old age, commit suicide or do what Jim did?
BUT, after that came the whole love story plot and Im sorry, but in what universe would a person react the way the Aurora reacted? Threw her life away in the end, when given the choice. Dude literally killed her, and she was okay with it? (OK, she was mad at him for a whole 10 minutes) I mean, it's a stupid ending to an just okay movie.
But still, I do not regret watching it."
" Great film - Weird Ending
",2020-05-24 00:00:00,6,"I'm going to start this by saying this is the first film review I've ever done and I created an account just to express my frustration towards the ending of this film.Personally, I loved the film, the film had amazing suspense and plot twists like with Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) having to hold the doors open for the reactor to vent the heat in order to save the ship although I feel like Sony had spent way too much in the start and middle of the film and ran out of money three quarters of the way through because I feel there was so much missing, we never got to see any sort of dispute or argument when they realize the AutoDoc could put one person back into hibernation, there was not even a mention of Aurora's (Jennifer Lawrence) decision (I do realize this wouldn't add a lot to the film in terms of time but it was a massive find that I feel should have been drawn out a little bit and would have added to the story.)Another thing that frustrated me was how the film just got cut off with Aurora and Jim sat at the bar and Jim hands Aurora the ring and BANG we're now looking at a scene 88 years later and the crew has woken up with no mention of what Aurora and Jim did. I know that it does kind of tell you with the crew walking out of the door to see the main lobby had been turned into a jungle with chickens and a little wooden house but, and I know I've already said this a lot, I just feel there was so much missing to the end of the story.I just feel there was such a massive hole in the story that it needs a prequel but I don't see how you could make a prequel out of what was missing, all the film needed was an extra 30 minutes to solidify it all.SIDE NOTE
(Not apart of the review but an opinion on peoples feelings towards Jim waking Aurora)I don't think Jim did the right thing in waking up Aurora although I personally can see why he did it, think about it, if you've spent a whole year in a big spaceship being the only person awake with the only thing on your mind is that no one else is going to wake up because it's been a year and no one else has, wouldn't you? I think I would."
" Worth a Watch
",2020-05-21 00:00:00,7,"Passengers (2016) directed by Morten Tylom, written by Jon Spaihts is a very interesting concept. It looks at how space travel communication is limited and that in order to reach places there is a large amount of time that has to pass to reach far away places in space. The film stars Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Prat as passengers on a spaceship where they are supposed to be asleep but they wake up. The film does a great job of showing the problems when doing deep space voyages. But the film's plot never really seemed to pick up and was very stagnant throughout the film. The acting was excellent but the execution of the plot was ok at best. There were stunning cinematic shots that showed space and the ship, this helped the film by adding an element of beauty in the harsh reality of space. The science and some of the action in the movie is nowhere near accurate but it worked in the film to have big moments and be considered a science fiction film. Overall, the film was good, interesting and worth a watch."
" Watch it in 4K to appreciate it
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,7,"Just watched it in 4K and I have to say my impression of the film now is a lot better than the first time I watched it in 1080p. The scene and setup is just stunning, every angle you discover something new with details and that makes their love story more believable if they're to stuck on that ship for so long, you feel what they feel through the details of the scenes, very good job here.During the ending part of the movie where she was trying to resuscitate him was one of the best acting by Lawrence I've seen, and it couldn't have done it without good editing, really felt the suspense.What I didn't like about the film the first time I saw it was there seems to be too much focus/attention built towards selling the two main actors. The movie poster says it a lot, what would people think if you put two of the hottest most popular actors of the era together and lock them in a confined space, what would happen. The problem is if viewers don't like these 2 then they have no urge to watch the movie, and it's a loss because the movie isn't really about them.Now to the stuff I think it's ridiculous:
1. Hibernation for 120yrs without stops in between, at least design a protocol to check on everybody every 10-20yrs, as in wake up, make sure everybody is okay, then go back to hibernation. The passengers don't need to wake up, but the crew does. And they should have a pod to do the hibernation, consider they have spare parts for everything on the ship but they don't have the one most important thing.
2. Civilians can't know how to fix the damn ship.
3. What a coincidence that the only crew member who's useful to fix the ship dies. His whole purpose I guess is to give Jim his wristband.
4. To leave earth and abandon all your families friends behind you'd be pronounced DEAD. Why not just clone some people and send them over on the long journey, awfully expensive too.
5. Last, the whole point of migration is because Earth is too crowded, but it's not explained what would happen once they have established the new colony with just 5000 people, does it mean they plan to ship more and more volunteers to the new planet so Earth can somehow resolve the population crisis? Wouldn't that take a million years? By that time I think mars would already be inhabitable, why travel so far.Overall entertaining movie, do not take it seriously."
" It's magical, don't fall for the bad critics jus watch it once
",2020-05-12 00:00:00,10,"Movie is available on Netflix. A very engaging movie, from the beginning to till end it will impress you.
Go for it."
" Really nice, but with a bit of ""uhm, how?"" moments.
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,8,"This movie was really nice, with incredible designs of both interior and exterior of the ship, but some things were not very well-thought. I really can't understand why the ship made all those ship-wide announcements 90 years before everybody woke up. Example? The Red Giant scene. ""You may want to proceed to a viewing area. The Avalon will slingshot around the star Arcturus"". WHY ARE YOU SAYING IT IF EVERYBODY IS ASLEEP??? Except for these minor quirks, this movie is a nice romance-in-space that also contains very suspenceful moments. I recommend it."
" I enjoyed it very much even though one could say that the idea is not very unique.
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,9,"I absolutely loved the movie. I assume that to the hardcore science fiction fans it won't be anything special. The reason i liked it s because the story is simple. It's a character driven story and doesn't try to pull your attention towards the science fiction related stuff to try to make it look more interesting which would have totally ruined it for me.
I don't watch movies like I used to before. I only watched somewhat 8-10 movies at full length in the last two or three years because I've been busy. This one was a good break from all the work and very much worth my while."
" Critics have a point, but don't tell the whole story
",2020-05-07 00:00:00,7,"This movie has its faults; it's predictable, cliché, and at times seems like it's a trailer for a Jennifer Lawrence, Chris Pratt sex tape (not necessarily complaining). However, it is so much more than just that. This movie is original, witty, and beautiful. The chemistry between Pratt and Lawrence is undeniable; they play off each other effortlessly. The story is also remarkably original. In an age filled with space expeditions and tales of new worlds, this movie manages to make something new and refreshing. In addition to being emotionally moving, Passengers is also visually stunning. It's possible that there were a few too many shots of the Avalon with nebulae and galaxies in the background, but who can complain when the view is as spectacular as it is. Passengers is a thoroughly enjoyable film. Both Pratt and Lawrence are near perfect fits for their roles, the entire film is beautiful, and action and drama fit seamlessly together. You might be able to predict what will happen next, but that doesn't mean this film is unenjoyable. The critics are far too harsh on this film; trust me, you'll like it."
" Sci Fi for non-Sci-Fi-people
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,8,"Not your typical Sci Fi movie but that's a good thing for me. The space background just gives a good background for the drama love story. It's relateable if not a little too clichee from time to time. Inseresting unique story, not too deep or anything but definitely entertaining with some fun and action. Chris Pratt does a good job as always, likeable charactor and Jennifer Lawrence is Jennifer Lawrence. Good watch for some weekend night."
" Enjoyed it very much
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,9,"I wonder. If at least this movie has additional 2-3 minutes at the ending, that would be fantastic. But this movie is great."
" Good production and great scenes
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,4,But the action taken by our lead is selfish and inconsiderate also theres just no way anyone wanting to get away from it all could ever get so lonely
" Unique and Next Level Movie
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,10,"Insanely Amazing movie , I am crying and crying , This movie will take you to another mentality . Best sci-fi movie ever ! Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence's Love story So Beautiful 😍"
" Predictable and cliche
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,3,"As others said, this is more a cliche romantic movie than a sci fi flick.
It's one of those movies so predictable that after a few minutes you know all the OBVIOUS things that are going to happen. I still watched it until the end just in case there was an unexpected twist but there wasn't any"
" The Critics got it wrong. Here's why.
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,7,"The movie was a pretty solid, not perfect, sci-fi film. The main reason I'm giving it an 8 (instead of probably a 7 or 6) is because of the whole ridiculous controversy the critics started over how Chris Pratt's character behaved.Here's what he did. Pratt prematurely wakes up from cryosleep in a spaceship bound to a distant planetary colony, all alone. He can't go back, due to a malfunction, and there are still tons of years left on the flight. He can't stand living alone and wants some company, so he researches the other passengers, finds one he likes, and wakes her up, making it look like an accident.The critics pounced, calling it 'creepy', 'toxic', 'not okay', and all those other words they come up with to describe things they can't bear. I'm not saying that Pratt's character acted in a morally acceptable way, but the movie wasn't saying that either. Isn't this kind of the point of science fiction, to show these possible moral dilemmas in fantastic scenarios and depict how humans would react to them? I'd be willing to bet that any of those critics, if they were in Pratt's situation, would have done the exact same thing; the act wouldn't have been so 'toxic' if their own sanity was on the line. It just shows that these critics have a poor understanding of science fiction storytelling. If it's something slinging mud on the patriarchy or on capitalism, they cheer and say how daring and thought-provoking and clever it is, but if it instead brings up moral problems beyond the scope of political correctness, they cry foul and slam it. It shows incredible close-mindedness and lack of intelligent thought in their political-ideology-driven minds.Other than that, the movie was okay, but not great. Jennifer Lawrence is an incredibly overrated actress. The moral dilemma was the most interesting aspect; without it the movie would have been dull. I was a little disappointed at the sterile ending."

" Passengers
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,5,"The critics gave this movie fairly low ratings, but there were some regular people I've seen that say that this was good, it looked and sounded like something worthwhile, so I decided I'd make my own mind up, directed by Morten Tyldum (The Imitation Game). Basically, The Avalon is a sleeper spaceship, transporting 5,000 passengers and 258 crew members in hibernation pods, designed to keep those onboard asleep for 120 years. The ship is on autopilot on a journey going across the universe to a new star system to the planet Homestead II, and the ship has so far travelled for 30 years. The ship travels through a meteor storm, power is diverted into the forward shield, and a collision with a large asteroid causes a power blink. The fault causes the computer to awaken one passenger, mechanical engineer James ""Jim"" Preston (Chris Pratt), from his induced hibernation. 90 years too early. He is told that it is normal to feel confused and weak after being asleep for so long, but he is concerned being the only person attending an orientation session. Jim goes around the various computer help systems for information of what is going on, and he is shocked to discover the truth. He tries various things to find a way to reactivate his hibernation pod, or get into the flight control room, but with no success. He sends a message asking for help but finds out it will be fifteen years before anyone on Earth receives it. He is on his own. For some time, he feels depressed, and only has the android barman Arthur (Michael Sheen) for company. Arthur encourages him to make the most of the time he has being alone, to do whatever he wants, so Jim find some entertainment on the ship, such as sneaking into the higher quality suite bedrooms, the many choices of food and drink, the swimming pool, sports equipment, virtual reality games, and much more. However, after a year of being alone, Jim once again becomes despondent, his only moment of some positivity is getting a spacesuit and stepping outside to see the stars. Jim contemplates committing suicide, remaining inside the chamber and opening the door to launch him into the vacuum of space, but he cannot bring himself to do it. Then, when exploring the various pods, Jim notices the beautiful passengers Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence), he studies her profile, she is a journalist travelling for adventure. He thinks she is perfect and is smitten; he wrestles with himself about waking her up, knowing that it will doom her to die on the ship, but he cannot stand the isolation and loneliness. He finally decides to awaken her, letting her believe that her pod also malfunctioned. Jim asks Arthur to keep the secret that he woke her up until Jim himself has told her. Aurora also makes various attempts to re-enter hibernation or contact the crew. Resigned to the situation, Aurora begins writing a book about her experience. Over the next year, Jim and Aurora become friends and partake in activities together. They eventually growing closer, go on a proper date together, and falling in love. Jim intends to propose to Aurora, but Aurora says to Arthur there are ""no secrets"" between her and Jim, and the android inadvertently reveals the truth to her. Aurora is shocked, anguished and enraged at Jim, she berates and for some time shuns Jim, also physically attacking him. She furiously rejects Jim's pleas for forgiveness, and she avoids any contact with him. Soon after, there is another fault in the system, another pod is damaged and Chief Deck Officer Gus Mancuso (Laurence Fishburne) is awakened from hibernation. Accessing the ship's mainframe, he discovers multiple failures have taken place throughout the ship's systems over some time. If not repaired, the ship will continue suffering critical system failures and the mission may fail. Gus tries to repair the ship, with help from Jim and Aurora, but he soon falls critically ill, having been physically weakened by his malfunctioning pod. The Autodoc, the ship's automated medical diagnostics and treatment pod, reveals that Gus has a prognosis of only hours to live. Gus gives Jim and Aurora his ID badge to access crew-only areas and to repair the ship before he dies. Jim and Aurora discover a series of hull breaches from the asteroid collision two years earlier. The computer module administering the fusion reactor powering the ship has been critically damaged, causing the cascading malfunctions across the ship as all other systems divert power towards the reactor. Jim and Aurora replace the damaged module. But Jim must vent the reactor to extinguish a massive reactor fire after the computer fails, he must open the vent hatch from the ship's exterior while Aurora assists from inside. Aurora admits being terrified of losing Jim and being left alone. After venting the reactor and the fire swarming his spacesuit, Jim's tether snaps, and his damaged suit starts losing oxygen. Aurora retrieves Jim from outer space, but must resuscitate him in the Autodoc, and eventually he is revived. Afterwards, Jim learns that the Autodoc can function as a makeshift hibernation pod for one person. He gives Aurora the chance to go back into hibernation for the remainder of the voyage. She realises she will never see Jim again, and chooses to remain awake with him. Jim presents her with the ring he had made, which she accepts. 88 years later, the ship's crew is awakened on schedule, a few months before the ship is due to arrive at Homestead II. Captain Norris (Andy Garcia) and the other passengers discover a huge tree, a forest of plants and vegetables, and birds flying. Aurora's voice, left in a recording, describes the wonderful life she and Jim lived together on the Avalon. Also starring Aurora Perrineau as Celeste, Aurora's best friend, with the voices of Emma Clarke, Chris Edgerly, Matt Corboy, Fred Melamed and Jon Spaihts (screenwriter) as the various voices of the Avalon computers. Lawrence and Pratt are both terrific actors, alone for some time Pratt is likeable, Lawrence is gorgeous and charming, and they do have great chemistry together, there is good short support from Sheen and Fishburne as well, but I don't understand the point of casting Garcia (who only appears for 10 seconds!). There are arguments that can be made about the moral aspects, perhaps the romance between the strangers is questionable, and it gets a little formulaic towards the end when it becomes a matter of life and death. But personally, I ignored any flaws there may or may not have been, and I just settled back and went with it, I think the critics are rather unfair with their opinions. It is a very compelling story with interesting ideas, splendid acting, a well-rounded script and concept, great set design, the special effects are fantastic, and I can see no reason to be disappointed, a pretty good science-fiction romantic drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music, Original Score for Thomas Newman, and Best Production Design. Worth watching!"
" Recommendation for watching the movie
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,7,"I write this for the people who didn't watched the movie so there aren't any spoilers it's just a recommendation for you. To everyone who read this in this moment, you won't regret to watch the film because it's a great played movie with a sound which fits perfect, a super cinematography and atmosphere and the idea to combine a sci-fi and a romance movie worked perfect."
" beautiful
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,6,"The scene was luxurious, satisfying my imagination of space travel. Space bunker alien river brilliant shock. But I have to say that this is a science fiction skin ethics drama, the main control computer hung up unexpectedly only one chief wake up, set to have a hard injury, there is no other way to rest dormant, the main control computer has changed, too. AI level is too low, how can a 120 year-old starship full of passengers have no emergency response system? How come there's only one cabin? This is unlikely.
It is said that Jim's awakening of Ojola is immoral and sinful, and that this is tantamount to murder, I do not deny. But if anyone had to spend the rest of his life with more than five thousand coffins, he would be mad. Therefore, it is human nature, not morality. It was selfish, but it was a last resort redemption.
The end I still like, they have been lost in the strange harbor, but they found to rely on, they began a new life, happy life, until old."

",2020-03-19 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed this movie. At the heart of it was the movie was an interesting moral dilemma which I won't go into as not to spoil the movie for some. All in all it was great science fiction. The two leads were cast perfectly in their roles and gave good performances, the special affects were great also. The last 20 mins was a bit lame but ultimately I really enjoyed it. It was a really sweet romantic movie even though the moral dilemma stuff made it a bit weird. It did strangely stick with me and for some time after I found myself thinking about the two characters and their situation and feelings for one another."
" If it had sucked I could have said something like ""want to go to sleep for 90 years? Just watch this movie!"" But it's actually pretty passable. So...yeah.
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,6,"The problem with high-concept stories is that they have a tendency to coast on their concept. But the thing about a great concept is that you can coast on them for quite a while and this movie has a good concept.Plotwise at least, this sort of writes itself; Act 1: the solitude, Act 2: the courtship, Act 3: well, I think I'll let you find out.I knew the basic premise going in but I still feel they missed a trick really establishing the main problem. our guy doesn't have that much in terms of personality but I liked him and enjoyed following on this emotional journey into the bowels of loneliness with only the automatons for company (and trust me, they're bad company).The design and sets will satisfy your technophilic cravings. The ship has a distinctive design I thought was pretty original and the chic, futuristic (but not cartoonishly futurist) insides made a wonderful backdrop as one man's gilded cage (I like that term, I'm not sure where I first read it...). At times it reminded me of a videogame in how you just wonder round and discover this three dimensional labyrinth where it neatly recycles some ideas that were wasted on Space Oddyssey.Watching this movie you just have to accept that there was no failsafe to early awakening because ""the pods don't malfunction"". When you think how much Health and Safety effects our lives right now, it's hard for me to accept that that would stop them hedging their bets. I can suspend disbelief for everything else no problem but this annoys me.So finally our deuteragonist becomes part of this. When I was reviewing ""Mother!"" I said that every role that went to Lawrence should have gone to Kristen Stewart (yeah, I know, bring on the dislikes), but this character was actually quite perfect for her, which is a discredit to the character. Rarely in fiction does one encounter someone as smug, self-satisfied and hoity-toity as this mademoiselle. I get the impression that I am just supposed to buy that she's the perfect that is out of any mechanic's league, but it's an informed attribute. Like how apparently they are an unlikely pair though personally I think he would dump her before she dumped him. We was a cool, sexy guy and a lot less self absorbed. When he asks her out she actually says ""I thought you'd never ask"". You coulda asked him out, you can either be a *girl* or help smash patriarchy, not both.The story actually has a lot of punch as it shows not only an initially desperate situation but also the extent this compels us to do something embarrassing to the one we really want to like us and the aftermath. So yeah, he's in the doghouse for a bit.That's another thing that bugged me: I wouldn't have thought about this a few years ago but it seems to always be the male character that the pursuer, the one that pines for the female and is the one that has to live with the idea that they messed up in their pursuit of the female. Why can't it be a male character that gets pursued this way, or a female character that is shown to pine and pursue a male? It could be homosexual or just inverted straightness, but it would be so easy to do...so that's my rant.Our final act is pretty intense and the suspense is really there. It's a pity that it's wasted hear since I was never sufficiently invested in this romance for it to have much of an emotional impact and the timing is frequently off. Suspense is like a joke, each part can't be too slow or too quick, it's a delicate operation but it looks stunning with a lot of inventive moments convincingly realized.Ultimately, passengers is a sweet piece of high budget science fiction with a perfectly workable plot that is fine for a Monday night, only really marred by a bland (but likeable enough) character and one really annoying character. The script isn't exactly tight either; a lot of the cutsiness just falls flat. But there's a good chuckle or two in the mix."
" Unforgettable
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,10,"There is one reason to see this film: Ms. Jennifer Lawrence. The esteemed and honored actor (actress is too limiting) gives what is nothing less than the performance of a lifetime. Ms. Lawrence's work is always superb but in this film what she does is beyond the capacity for words to express. A simply shattering performance. The set design and direction are fine, so is Pratt, and the story haunting. But it is Jennifer Lawrence the finest actor of our lifetime who makes this film unforgettable."
" Thought provoking and not designed to please feminists
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,10,"I think some reviewers have lost sight of the fact that this is a film. A fiction. It isn't real. So they are 'calling out' the sexism, the  fantasy', the male patriarchy elements where a 'man' (ugh) wakes up a woman just because he wants company, and only after considerable agonising. Yes, he did the wrong thing, and he knew he had, but this was the whole point of this fictional film - it makes you think - what would I do in this dilemma? You can't give a film 1 star because you disagree with what one of the characters did. That is not how film reviews work. Otherwise The Shining would have universal 1 star reviews wouldn't it? Oh no, that's fine, because it is only violence, not sex.It is also helpful whenever accusations of sexism are flung around to reverse the polarities and say ok, what if it was a woman waking up a man? You would not hear a peep out of any of the angry complainants and indeed they would probably give the film 10 stars. A woman empowers herself!So instead of judging a film based on whether or not you agree with what the characters are doing (which is a stupid approach as then every horror or murder film would be instantly rubbish), let's look at it as an artistic endeavour. Yes, there were some minor plot holes, but this is sci-fi. From my perspective, the acting was great, the sets were magnificent, the directing was excellent, and the story made you think. I was certainly glued to it until the end, and it entertained me. Isn't that what films are supposed to do?And if Chris Pratt had just carried on in the space ship on his own for the next 60 years chatting to Arthur that would have made for a boring film, wouldn't it?"
" a lot better than I was expecting
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,7,"I was expecting the same old space opera stuff here, and sure enough it opens with a raft of visual clichés from the likes of 2001, Alien and (more surprisingly) The Shining. For me, coming from the same pen as the daft Prometheus was no recommendation. And so it was nice to find that the story developed into something quite new and interesting; not only that, it's told with a rare humour (in space, usually, no one can hear you laugh). I especially enjoyed Michael Sheen's performance as a slightly dorky android.However once Laurence Fishburne has come, set up the finale, and gone again, the moral dilemmas are shelved and the film lurches into much more familiar (that is, stale) disaster movie territory. I suppose the film's beautiful looks had to be paid for this way - as we know, all Hollywood movies have to end with a Big Explosion - but it's a shame as the story didn't need it; nor did the film's wise if obvious message need to be underlined by a reprise at the end."
" Good sci-fi
",2020-02-25 00:00:00,8,"This is one of those movies that works well with a limited cast & setting. I enjoyed the movie as a man is on a spaceship en route to another planet, gets awakened 90 years too soon, wakens a female passenger out of sheer loneliness, and they soon learn that their being awakened might not have been an accident!The chemistry between the actors is superb, and I liked the story and the setting and the bartender. It wasn't as boring as any description or poster might have made it out to be.** 1/2 out of ****"
" Amazing Scifi Movie - An Emotional Roller Coaster of Desperation, Love, & Guilt
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,10,"I'm normally quite critical of movies and hard to please. But WOW. This movie was amazing! It fits into categories of sci-fi, drama, mystery, and romance (that's not cheesy)--all in a great balance. Although the base sci-fi plot itself is quite unoriginal, but they did a fantastic job of executing it in their own way with a great story. I felt very invested into the believable characters: the ironic situations that saddened them, angered them, sparked love, handling guilt, etc. The movie is heart-wrenching, intense, and intriguing. The movie is truly an emotional roller coaster exploring some deep social aspects of life, loneliness, companionship, love, selfishness, and bitterness.My favorite part about the movie is that it wonderfully explores an intense philosophical moral dilemma: if you were all alone to the point of misery and desperation, but could summon someone to you, would you do it at the cost of stealing away their life for your selfish gain? Man, I have not felt this emotionally touched by a movie in a very long time and I think it just because one of my favorite movies ever. Of course, like all movies, it had flaws. But I was willing to overlook those flaws because the movie had so many elements that appealed to me: science fiction, exploring a philosophical/moral dilemma, believable characters you empathize with, nostalgic sentimentality, mystery and intensity, and a non-cheesy romance. A must watch!"
" great love
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,8,"The film is very aesthetic. It's just a space version of Titanic. It's absolutely romantic for Jim and Aurora to go out of the spaceship and swim in space. In a sense, science fiction is also the embodiment of romance and loneliness in space that makes them love each other. Love and loneliness promote each other and make the story reach an unprecedented level. To be honest, there was a moment when I wanted to have this experience."
" Good visual design and imagination, but...
",2020-02-22 00:00:00,8,"A big compliment for our main male character, thank you."
" Movie okay, story not okay
",2020-02-18 00:00:00,4,"Touching on the idea of solitude doesn't make for an automatic romantic situation, especially when the spark was a morally irresponsible decision. No amount of pretty music can make up for how this story sets its foundation. If the viewer can get past that one little aspect -- for me a very big, critical aspect -- they might be able to enjoy the movie for its other qualities. I for one, could not avail myself of that bad taste in my mouth right from the get go, no matter how persistent the music tried to make me think otherwise.The plot is simple, but the actors did a real good job in making it believable. The man finds himself stranded on a ship bound for a distant planet, the intent of the journey being colonization. There are other people, but they are all asleep. He woke up too early to find there is still 90 years to go before reaching the destination. He opts to wake one of the passengers for companionship, and thus the romance begins."
" Don't let critics decide what you watch.
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,10,"My fiance didn't want to watch this movie. By the third time I asked, they said it was because of the reviews they'd been hearing. So, I watched it this morning after they left for work. It's somewhere between a psychological thriller, sci-fi, & drama. Going in with expecting it to meet some constraint or plotline standard of being one or another, and you MAY be disappointed. If you take the story as being more of an allegory/metaphor, it is a really good movie in my opinion."
" incorporating
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,10,"Terminator genesis into the discussion here. Because its been said that both films (and all other films) have existed in all the points in time. Sara Conner (played by Emilia Clark) was born in a barn, woke up, and left the barn to try and live in the main house with the other people. But the year is 1901 and actress (Clark) is only a kid, not even a seasoned actress yet. So how is it that when she enters the house her mother holds out both terminator Genesis and passengers (dvds) to show Emilia? Of course the dvds were just drawings, sketches by a profit. Spooked Emilia then runs on all fours back into the barn, with her mother in hot pursuit. her mother says: ""please come into the house, use the bathroom and use the running water, we'll go get you a pink pillow case for your bed."" But Emilia did not want to hold a real life, and, of course did not want to eventually play character roles in passengers and terminator Genesis."
" A sure footed film that could have come across as stilted or too chaptery if not for Thomas Newman's score and Tyldum's solid direction.
",2020-02-10 00:00:00,7,"When I read the script on the blacklist years ago it played much like a chunky little B-movie, but with some star power and some budget it turned into something else, something I really didn't like on first watch, but here and now I really enjoyed for the pulpy, glossy sci-fi drama it is. Strangely I found this one of Chris Pratt's best performances, gentle and subdued and emotional.
The plot contains some difficult morals but a castaway film always would and human nature and loneliness is a strange beast and I think is examined perfectly fine here and anyone's issues with it seem a little bandwagony instead of taking it as a film on its merits and it's genre.
The 3D wasn't powerful at first, however once it settled, the deep close ups were powerful and added a lot to the movie, crisp, weighty shots against the commercial gloss of the set design.
Overall it's a film that could have done more with its ideas but chose to settle with some Hollywood gloss, but as it goes, it's pretty solid, consistent stuff."
" Script of a horror movie, filmed as a love story
",2020-02-07 00:00:00,3,"I remember checking Twitter in December 2016 and seeing the initial ""reactions"" towards Passengers; to say Passengers pissed off ""Outrage Twitter""™ would not do the single-day uproar justice.Saying I was mystified is an understatement.Passengers was marketed as Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt as a couple who fall in love while alone in space on a dying spacecraft. Two giant film stars in a science fiction epic, directed by Morten Tyldum who just did The Imitation Game? Sign me up please!Then I saw the movie years later and understood the outrage.Passengers is the type of movie that I'd have expected to be made in 1972 with Charlton Heston and a far goofier tone. To see this film made in 2016 is almost beyond comprehension.To accurately convey my feelings I need to go into heavy SPOILERS.First off, the marketing was a lie; Lawrence got most of the screen time in the ads and is top-billed but she's really the supporting character to Pratt who is alone for the first act of this movie. Oh, and the ads completely made it appear that Pratt and Lawrence woke up at the same time and that there was a ""reason"" they woke up early...yeah, nope. If I was an audience member I'd be pissed.Passengers is at times a great idea for a science fiction classic but then it becomes almost disgusting in the way it handles a love story that when written down comes across as something out of nightmares. One slight rewrite and this could easily have been a horror movie; or at least the science fiction version of Ingrid Goes West.Well, before I go too far I'll give a summary. In the space-age future mankind has decided to colonize other distant worlds. On a 120 year spaceflight to a new planet, ""I fix things"" engineer Jim (Chris Pratt) wakes up 90 years too early when his sleep pod malfunctions as the ship goes through an asteroid field-stranding him on this giant spaceship with no way to go back to sleep. A year later, faced with spending his remaining days alone with no hope of rescue, Jim bumps into the pod of journalist Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence) and instantly gets horny for the sleeping beauty; as well as cyberstalks her like a creep by going through all the files about her on the computer. Jim wakes up Aurora by sabotaging her pod and they ""fall in love"" over the course of a year until-shockingly-Aurora learns that Jim basically stalked and murdered her! Luckily for Jim the ship starts to fall apart so they are forced to work together to save it while Jim risks his life to save her...you can guess where this goes.Passengers is a tale of three acts: thought provoking, nightmare stalker love story, and boring action climax.On the bright side I'll say the first 25 minutes of the film are good. Before the disgusting and tone-deaf love story happens and we just see Jim wander around this massive, empty ship it is rather poetic. Jim's situation is unique compared to other ""alone"" tales as he has access to entertainment and will never starve or likely ever get sick-Jim's only destiny is dying of old age or suicide. As time passes and Jim becomes more and more disheveled we can see what he's going through and why he might jump to the action that he did. It's just too bad that the love plot was written so horribly.Now, I can see what Tyldum and writer Jon Spaihts were going for here: if you were stuck alone and could wake up someone else to keep you company/fall in love with, would you? It's an interesting premise for a science fiction film to tackle that is a familiar ""what if"" scenario. The problem is it's handled so terribly. This segment just comes across like the studio or testing audiences wanted more ""drama"" and thus they revamped the second act in such a way to have more traditional romantic-comedy, liar-revealed pacing. I'll at least give Passengers a bit of credit because Aurora does get suitably angry at Jim...for 10 minutes of screen time. Had Jim at all seemed guilty for what he did outside of a couple of silent glances I think it would have helped make him less detestable. Lawrence and Pratt do their best with the material and make a nice couple but it's just impossible to overcome the scripts' failures. As presented Passengers is the tale of Jim wanting to bang a hot blonde girl he bumped into that he then stalked online...seriously.The final act of the film is also extremely boring and predictable. Big budget stars means you need an out-of-nowhere fiery action climax with explosions because they have to kiss and make up for some reason, right? Nothing better to hastily get our lovers back together than an attempted heroic sacrifice! Bonus points for being featured heavily in the trailer to misrepresent the movie!Passengers also suffers from being contrived to fit the plot. The idea that ""nothing ever malfunctions"" is beaten to death as the excuse to why Jim and Aurora are stuck; why would they ever need to have emergency plans when nothing ever breaks? So when Jim wakes up and the computers can't comprehend that an error occurred, as well as the fact that the company decided to stick all important people and equipment behind impenetrable doors that only crew could open, we aren't meant to question that. Oh and how come the ship is still completely active-including a Michael Sheen bartender robot-even though it won't be used for over a century? Then we have the Laurence Fishburne cameo where he plays the dude that they conveniently need to be able to open the ship up-right after they break up but just before the action climax happens. It's all just too convenient to make this story work.I honestly wonder if Passengers was a much cheaper production it would have been a far better product. I read that this film was originally planned for about a $40 million budget and had more reasonably priced names attached; all of which makes way more sense for a more subdued tale of Sci-Fi morality. Passengers had a budget of $110 million or more, and while pretty to look at it doesn't feel like a movie that needed to be blockbuster sized. Maybe Sony thought that they could duplicate the success of Gravity, Interstellar and The Martian as blockbuster space based ""rescue"" films-albeit without award hype or an effective marketing campaign. I don't know for sure, but Passengers just feels like Sony throwing money at a project in hopes that bigger equals better.Passengers is just disappointing. A film with ambition, Passengers shows us that Pratt and Lawrence can carry a movie by themselves but can't save a movie from its own inept plot. What little hope the opening act gave us of a truly unique film quickly dissipates under the weight of a poorly thought out love story where you end up hating the characters instead of rooting for them. Beautiful sets and effects can't hide the rotten stink of contrivance to ram these two lovebirds through trials and tribulations because that's what a chart in a production studio office said to do."
" Worth watching
",2020-02-04 00:00:00,7,"This really is a good movie, with a great story line that goes beyond sci-fi into the deeper aspects of the human psyche, and how we need others.

" An imperfect but remarkable film.
",2020-01-31 00:00:00,8,"Passengers.A science fiction film directed by Morten Tyldum, written by Jon Spaihts; starring Chris Pratt, Jennifer Lawrence, Michael Sheen and Laurence Fishburne.Synopsis:
In the futuristic era of humans colonizing other planets, a hibernation pod fails and leaves one person awake, stranded inside the ship, with more than a lifetime to go before arrival to destination. Will he live his life in solitary, end it all or spread out his predicament to others by messing with their hibernation pods?Some degree of spoiling ahead.""Passengers"" is a remarkable film, an imperfect one, but fun to watch and fairly thought provoking.I have two lines of thought that arise from the film, one regarding the film itself and the other that delves into the subject that the film opens for discussion.First the ethical dilemma.Many critics of this movie, have focused on the ethical dilemma. Some have said that it's not even a dilemma because Jim's decision is so blatantly wrong. Some focus on the sexist characteristics of the decision, because it is perceived as Jim awakening Aurora in order to use her for his benefit.I think they are confusing the character with the writer. The decision is wrong yes, but that's what's interesting about the story. The writer in not saying this is a good decision. He is asking, if confronted with such a dilemma, wouldn't we all be tempted to do what the character did?Waking Aurora is controversial, but so is almost every decision of life and death caliber we can make in real life. Chris' decision to wake up Aurora reminds me of a situation I have seen countless times in romantic couples in real life. When a wife puts pressure on a husband (or the other way around if you will) to ""stay home more on sundays"" for example, she is rightly demanding him to fulfill his promise as a husband to be with his wife, but she is also egotistically asking him to sacrifice his individual needs, in order to have him near her for her own personal needs.I'm not trying to find an answer in a couple of paragraphs. We could argue about this situation for months and never come to a satisfying conclusion, the moral and ethical considerations become very complicated and quite a bit subjective when we talk about this kind of question. My point is that we are always balancing egoism and altruism and sometimes there is no clearly defined line to divide the two. Human nature and nature itself has to be egotistical to a certain point or there would be no survival of the fittest, no survival of the species, no personal achievement of goals. We all capture fragments of other people's lives for our personal benefit. The key is that there should be consent, but then again consent is sometimes a result of some degree of pressure. That is why I said before that I suspect (given the situation the movie establishes) we would all seriously consider the option of waking others, rather than just discarding the idea as ethically wrong.In conclusion, I'm not saying Chris' decision is right, I'm saying Tyldum and Spaihts are right in offering this subject for discussion and I thank them for it.Now the film and it's merits.I already said the film is imperfect, but not because it takes a stand on the moral dilemma. Rather, because I feel the third part is a waste of what was achieved during the first two thirds. Why do they feel the need to turn every film towards the action-explosion path when there was a very interesting situation, worthy of a great film, already going on? The movie is not ruined, I like it anyway. The production is top notch, the acting is excellent and the pace is great too.The cliched action-explosion situation could have been avoided, for example, by having the Avalon's failing system start messing up the hibernating people or even killing them. Or by losing navigation capabilities and going in the wrong direction.The last part of the plot is coherent given the direction the writer was going once he decided that Jim's decision was fortuitously good for Aurora, hence ""redeeming"" him. Because she would have been killed if the ship had exploded or whatever was going to happen without their intervention. Therefore, he inadvertently ""saved"" her by waking her up. However, it might have been more satisfying to take a more ambiguous direction and explore the situation if the ship was not facing certain destruction. If Chris' decision was not so clearly ""necessary"" for the survival of all the passengers and crew.I also feel the machine waking up Gus feels too much like a need of the plot, so he can tell Jim where to look and to give Aurora the ""drowning man"" speech. In lesser films, this might be irrelevant, but for me, this movie was good enough that I feel it would have been even better if it had avoided both the action-explosion commonplace and the easy justification of Chris' decision."
" 2 Less Point
",2020-01-29 00:00:00,8,The movie's storyline is good. It's set design/visual effect is very beautiful and seems realistic. But I didn't like the male-pleasing ending (despite being a male myself).
" A must see space or love movie
",2020-01-21 00:00:00,10,"If you like space movies or love films, this is for you. First of all and most important issue it is a very good and original story, the rest of things that build a good film are simply perfect."
" Just different, heart breaking and beautiful.
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,10,"Normally I don't like Sci Fi Movie's alot but this was just different from all I've seen so far. The movie really drags you in. The hole idea to awake on a spaceship alone 90 year's to early gave me shivers. I really empathizes with the characters. Also with the Character of Jennifer Lawrence. She is really such a good actress.
Plus what I really liked about the movie was the point, that Robot's, Cyborg's and everything that's maschine driven, will never be able to replace a human! In the way of thinking or speaking or being sensible. That's what the movie is actually about for me.Also the ending is so beautiful. The idea of making the best out of the situation and their lifes."
" Just a clue about how bad it is: I should have watched ""Last Christmas"".
",2020-01-17 00:00:00,2,Boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
" Transcended all of my expectations! Just go watch it. It will stay with you for a while.
",2020-01-16 00:00:00,10,"Incredibly relatable, wonderfully logical and most of all - thought-provoking. Great visual effects too. My eye was full the entire time. I couldn't help but see me and my wife in those 2's roles. That touched me a lot. For that reason would have enjoyed seeing a bit more about their story at the end, but that was the director's call and I respect it. Would watch again."
" A Jennifer Fan must see
",2020-01-14 00:00:00,7,"Coulda been Grace Kelly and Gary Cooper, it's all the same story."
" Could have been a dark psychological masterpiece in the hands of somebody like Kubrick...
",2020-01-13 00:00:00,4,"But instead the film goes all fluffy and wishy washy with the morality of the protagonist and what he has done. There could have been real empathy with the protagonist's solitude and his resulting actions, followed by scenes dripping with tension combined with internal psychological battles regarding his decision and the third act should have been one of pure revulsion. Anyways, where is Kubrick and what has he been up to lately? A movie that does have some parallels to this and is true sci fi worth seeing is Aniara."
" Long, slow romance with cool sci-fi bits
",2020-01-12 00:00:00,4,"In the future some spaceship owned by a corporation is transporting thousands of people in hibernation to a colony planet. Even though it has some fancy shield to protect it during a meteor shower it is hit by a large meteor. The ship can also fix itself, which it does, but there some one item left it can't fix. Suddenly one guy named Jim is awoken from hibernation. There is no else awake not even crew. The whole ship is automated, the AIs are of no help. There are plenty of little robots cleaning things. Jim sends a message to headquarters which is going to take several decades to arrive. He learns that they are 90 years away from their destination and he cannot put himself into hibernation. For some reason Jim desperately tries to break in the cockpit but to no avail. He makes use of the facilities on the ship which include everything someone could want. Except that it's arranged by social classes. He's a mechanic so he's lower class and gets a small cabin and lousy food. But the spacewalks are fun. One day he discovers an open bar and a bartender, but it's a robot as well. But at least he can have conversations with it. After a year he goes looking at the hibernation pods and finds a pretty girl. It occurs to him to maybe wake her up. But he's undecided and chats with the robot/bartender named Arthur about it.Then one day he decides to wake the girl up pretending it's another ship malfunction. She's pretty antisocial and doesn't care much about him. She too tries to break into the cockpit for no good reason after getting frustrated with the unhelpful AI. But she's upper class so she has access to better food/facilities. Little by little she warms up to Jim and they go on dates and try to have fun. On the day he wants to give her a ring, Arthur decides to spill the beans and tell the girl that Jim woke her on purpose. She flips out of course realizing that it's a death sentence and basically wants nothing to do with him.Over time things start to malfunction aboard the ship, starting with the little cleaning robots. Then suddenly Jim and the girl run into another guy, he's the captain. Now things on the ship start breaking down real fast. The captain, too, is sick. The healing pods can do nothing for him; he's got massive multi-organ failure and has a few hours to live. In the last couple of seconds he tells them that they have to find out what is wrong with the ship and fix it.Somehow they quickly realize it's something near the fusion core and sure enough the meteorite broke through the walls. Things now are seriously overheating and the venting system isn't working so Jim realizes he has to do a spacewalk outside to fix the vent doors while the girl pulls the handle to vent the core. Of course things don't go smoothly and we learn whether they manage to save the ship and all people on board.I'm telling it as if it were an action sci-fi film, but Passengers isn't. The focus here is the on/off romance and drama between the two. The romance is alright I guess. Not sure if people who like romance are annoyed as much by the bits of action as much as action people are by the romance. The setting was ideal for horror action sci-fi instead of romance and drama. The premise is pretty good, of course nothing new. The visuals too are cool, both the bits of cosmos and the fancy modern interior design of the spaceship. The problem for me was the excessive length of the movie and that during most of it, nothing is really at stake. No effort is made to get us to care about the fate of the 5000 passengers. The rest is pretty predictable, so it's not like the movie surprises at any point. Not sure why Tyldum got involved in this. There's nothing in the script that is remotely interesting or that has potential for a director to leave his mark. If anything it's Pratt who makes this dull movie work."
" Conceptually Stranded on a Desert Island
",2020-01-09 00:00:00,7,"(Flash Review)As a spaceship with 5,000 passengers voyages from Earth to a new planet for habitation, a man's hibernation pod malfunctions and wakes him up with NINETY years remaining before arrival. Alone on this vastly elegant spaceship, he copes with being the only human awake. Facing a lifetime of solitariness with 4,999 other sleeping people, will his natural desire for companionship lead him to make a rash decision? What ramifications will result? Other questions, why would someone migrate from Earth and travel 120 years away to a new planet? Flush with modern and stylish sets and concepts, the core of the story is very raw with human's internal need and desire for company and companionship. It was a well-told story with a few questionable moments yet didn't detract from the heart of the engaging and fun story."
" Trash
",2020-01-05 00:00:00,1,"This is a gross INCEL fantasy brought to the big screen. Transpose Pratt's characters actions to any comparable real life situation and he'd be arrested. The film acknowledges this, for ten minutes then sets off on a winding road of victim-blaming and finishes with good 'ole Jim being the hero! This is a bad bad screenplay full of plot holes and flawed logic."
" Alone Together in Space
",2020-01-05 00:00:00,7,"Keeping it short.
Love the ship and the entire premise of colonizing space, excellent.
Love the plot. Although in the middle more should have been done to clarify his faith in his actions beyond mere infatuation.
Jennifer Lawrence was great. Michael Sheen was too. Chris Pratt however in the scenes where he was meant to be the doting lover or show real emotion was hilariously bad.
The notion that in that short of a time a person would basically go mad is silly. Read a book why don't ya?
The ending was disappointing - I expected someone to be there when the crew woke up. 'nuff said."
" Could have been great in right hands
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,5,"The premise of the movie is interesting, but they decided to go big instead. Sad really, because it could have been a new sci-fi masterpiece in right hands."
" A new color you have never seen before A new taste you haven't tasted before
",2020-01-02 00:00:00,10,"The story is absolutely amazing and completely new. It is different from anything I have ever seen .
Jennifer Lawrence's performance is very realistic
I love this movie"
" , much better than comic book heros and ""popular"" sci-fi.
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,10,"Passengers centers around a deep, existential question of ethics, morality, selfishness, empathy. It actually has an original plot, as well as some of the best visual effects ever. Oh yeah, it also has real acting. I highly recommend this for anyone who appreciates intelligent SF."
" Very enjoyable, visually great, falls short
",2019-12-26 00:00:00,7,"Most of the other reviews are spot on. IMHO, this is an enjoyable movie with superb visuals and popular actors who deliver. The ending appears written by studio execs who pander and hold this back from being good science fiction. Instead of the Iron Man like stunt at the end, the hero should have died... Thus putting her in the exact same position he was in. Alone and thinking about waking someone else up..."
" Feels lioe watching Titanic!
",2019-12-22 00:00:00,10,"I like this movie, because it's merge sci fi and romantic as well, very interesting with nice story, everything seems good and nice!"
" The film with good idea
",2019-12-21 00:00:00,7,"Beginning of the movie was really interesting, I thought ""wow, this movie is so interesting"". As movie go on it was getting not so attractive in interest. Also it was a little bit predictable. But definitely recommend to watch this movie because it has really good idea"
" Excellent production design and art direction.
",2019-12-18 00:00:00,8,"Creates a credible long distance spaceship travel atmosphere of a distant future. Very good acting from four matured lead actors. Set decoration, production design and art direction are excellent. Intelligent script with some philosophical analysis. Right passenger-Chris Pratt is chosen to wake up to mend the spaceship by the system somehow."
" Not bad, just slow
",2019-12-18 00:00:00,6,"Not every movie has to be action packed or quick paced. The movie is well acted and does a good job conveying the loneliness of being the only person in a ship designed for thousands.The only complaint I have is this could be established with better writing. It plods along a somewhat telegraphed storyline and ends up becoming monotonous for too long.The writing, however, redeems itself in the last 20 minutes and succeeds in evoking the emotional connection it was lacking earlier."
" Easy way to fix her mindset
",2019-12-14 00:00:00,8,"She was all about writing, making an impact, and being the first. Well, write about your life as you travel the stars. People will wake up to history. That's a worthy goal."
" Beautiful. Acting masterpiece.
",2019-12-14 00:00:00,10,"She saved him twice. First unwittingly when he woke her up. Then when his tether broke.But, ironically, he saved her by waking her up. Had she not been around to help save the ship none would have survived.Jennifer. Oh my. Never before did I appreciate how gorgeous, And her superb acting. Of course Chris is awesome too. Perfect casting."
" This movie doesn't deserve all the bad reviews
",2019-12-12 00:00:00,8,"I avoided this movie for a lot of time because it had bad reviews from the critics, but then I watched it and I really enjoyed it, it's not a perfect movies but it's also not that bad as critics sad, I think.I really liked the story, it is something that was never done before and i loved the fact that this movies is a romance, an action movie and a space movies at the same time. If you like at least one of this genre you should watch it, despite of the bad critics reviews."
" Okay Film, Wrong Actors
",2019-12-09 00:00:00,6,"I often look at movie actors and wonder how much theatre work they've done and in a film with so few actors you really need to have presence and, good God, a range of expressions.
This film is minimalist enough to take place or a stage and frankly, Pratt and Lawrence wouldn't hold the audience's attention.
Pratt is okay for comedy and action, but not for thought pieces.
One could only imagine how much better this movie would have been had he and Sheen swapped roles."
" Solid movie panned by femi-nazis who didn't even understand the movie at all.
",2019-12-09 00:00:00,8,"The main message of the movie is about forgiveness.
Can woman forgive a man who made mistake of falling in love with her and tried to manipulate her?Obviously not! Because... True love is about loving person for who they really are, by spending time together, impressing her by gifts, taking her out to dinner etc which are in the end also forms of manipulation.But!
And here's the main part which many agenda driven critics forgot about: If the woman is smart enough she should able to see through the manipulation and see the man for what he really is.And this is what this movie is about."
" A must see for all love story and sci-fi fans!
",2019-12-08 00:00:00,10,"This film came out 3 years ago and I've always wanted to see it. Thankfully i took a big risk and brought the blur-ray and oh boy am i glad i did. Passengers is one of the best sci- Fi film I've seen in years not counting star wars of course. The love story between Jim and Aurora is simply beautiful. the ending was amazing, Jim feeling lonely after waking up 90 years earlier than planned. Opens Aurora pod and befriends her it was amazing i loved it. a lot of people are calling this film Stockholm syndrome but it's not and for those who do in fact say that i encourage you to rematch the film with a more open mind.
I loved everything i highly recommend this film to everyone at least 14 and up."
" Great idea, poorly executed
",2019-12-06 00:00:00,3,An interesting idea but it was rather cringey to watch. A disney-like storyline with multiple meaningless deaths and filled with plotholes. It failed at being a good sci-fi movie as well as being a toxic romance movie.The cinematography was very beautiful though.
" Good Entertainment
",2019-12-03 00:00:00,7,"Pleasantly surprised with this movie. I Was completing my usual scroll of Netflix and i almost gave up, when i saw Passengers and thought this will do. I Was prepared to whip out my phone and give it half of my attention, when i found myself truly engaged. No phone required. Give it a go i think a quite a few people will like this one."
" It will touch your heart
",2019-12-02 00:00:00,10,"This movie simply avery touching movie in every way you got a man who willing to give everything for others, willing to sacrifice himself for others. And willing to do anything to be with his love of his life and yet willing to lose her if it meant saving her life. Beautifull movie with a beautifull ending... immediately watch it again over and over again. Really wished there are more touching movies such as this. All the actors and actres are a perfect casts, loved the acting, i can truly feels the characters being potreyed."
" Passengers by Wayne Keeley
",2019-12-02 00:00:00,8,"BAIT AND SWITCH - the action (generally illegal) of advertising goods that are an apparent bargain, with the intention of substituting inferior or more expensive goods.The trailer and promos for the movie Passengers definitely constitute a carefully thought-out marketing plan using bait and switch tactics.First the BAIT: two of the biggest stars today - Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence. The setting: a colonial spaceship traveling through space - the final frontier. The plot: The ship goes through a meteor storm causing Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) to awaken from deep hibernation 90 years too soon. After more than a year living alone he is joined (can't say how - it will spoil the movie) by Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence) and Chief Deck Officer (Laurence Fishburne). The conflict: certain ethical and moral actions undertaken by Chris Pratt. The rising climax: the meteor storm has damaged the ship leading to the imminent breakdown of all systems and death to everyone on board including 5000-plus sleeping passengers. Production value: 110-million dollar production budget. Cool sci-fi doodads: swimming pool with empyreal view; ultra hi-tech food cooker and dispenser (okay, Star Trek had one too); a charismatic, artificially intelligent robot bartender named Arthur. Nice CGI and special effects: especially the anti-gravity scenes.Sounds like a slick, expensive sci-fi, hi-tech, mystery, thriller, action/adventure, right? Wrong.The SWITCH: a chick-flick with expensive sci-fi trappings that have nothing to do with the story. Indeed, if Jon Spaihts' screenplay was a novel, it would be categorized as women's upmarket fiction. Not that there is anything wrong with a chick flick - but do we really need the bait and switch? I wish I could go more into detail, but that would just violate our policy (my wife's) against giving out spoilers.Apart from the bait and switch issue, the movie is TOTALLY derivative. Yeah, I know that there is nothing original anymore, especially in Hollywood - but still - there were so many homages, clichés, and rips that my mind became overloaded like the defunct computer, Hal, in 2001: A Space Odyssey. There were real similarities to Cast Away, Lost in Space, Gravity, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Titanic, Interstellar, 50 Shades of Grey, Groundhog Day (yes, Chris Pratt's obsession with Jennifer Lawrence in a way mirrors Bill Murry's obsession with Andie MacDowell), The Martian, Star Trek IV, Alien, The Bible, and countless others.Despite all of the above, I did enjoy the movie. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence had REAL chemistry. The solid acting and direction by Morten Tyldum kept me engaged throughout; no anti-heine itch cream needed. Michael Sheen's performance as the android robot was MasterCard priceless.Would I have gone if the trailer portrayed Passengers as Romeo and Juliet in Outer Space (with overtones of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?)? Probably not. Am I glad I saw it? Yes. So I guess the bait and switch wasn't that much of a negative tactic after all."
" Excellent movie beautiful sets..
",2019-11-26 00:00:00,10,"I thoroughly enjoyed the whole movie, the acting, the storyline the CGI and the ending... i have watched it about twice a year and still enjoy it..."
" Started well, but...
",2019-11-23 00:00:00,5,"I thought this film had moments of brilliance, but I was disappointed how the story moved away from the relationship of the two passengers and instead focused on the ship malfunctioning. Really killed it for me.
I would have loved the story to follow the lives of the two protagonists and how their relationship evolved overtime on the ship.
I really liked the nod to ""The Shining"" with the bartender in the golden ballroom, was a great touch. The set design was incredible.
But ultimately, in the end, they decided to go all ""Hollywood"" with it. Disappointed."
" Not exactly gripping
",2019-11-23 00:00:00,5,"Surprised at the abundance of great reviews here. There's a reason I didn't buy the DVD, There's not much to this film. So the guy opens her hibernation module early and has to deal with her outrage. Ok, anything else? I got bored. I was hoping for some real goings-on, but nothing came."
" Great movie!!
",2019-11-19 00:00:00,9,"This movie is a masterpiece! The plot, the acting, the visuals and all the cinematography is on point!!! Why I haven't heard of that movie?? Bad marketing maybe! But the movie is lit! And have a little bit if everything !"
" Omg
",2019-11-14 00:00:00,9,This movie is so underrated how the hell I didn't heard of this movie before do your self a favour and watch this movie
" Professional reviewers robbed you the chance of watching this beauty at the cinema.
",2019-11-10 00:00:00,9,"Luckily I have a 110"" HD home projection system with active 3D and surround sound and was able to see this movie as it was meant to be seen. A truly full blown emersive experience!!!I'm a sci-fi nut and my wife most definitely isn't and this is one of the few sci-fi movies that we both often enjoy watching. The sci fi part is plausible, the romantic element is relatable, the special effects are realisticaly stunning and the ending is beautiful yet tragic.There is probably nothing more isolating than being out there in the expanse of space, and Passengers takes you on this voyage effectively. The vast canvas of infinite space is beautifully yet frighteningly laid out in front of you.Passengers isn't just a movie, it's an experience, and if professional reviews swayed you from watching it on the big screen then you've really missed something truly special.Initially I watched Passengers on a 3D Blu Ray rental and since have bought my own copy."
" Pretty good.
",2019-11-05 00:00:00,7,I don't understand the bad criticism this movie got. The performances are amazing (JL does one of her best works) and Pratt is Pratt and excelled at it.The theme might be cliché but it's a damn good one.The visuals and set decoration are stunning and very beautiful.The references to classic films like The Shining are way awesome.The final act is pretty intense and the scene with the medical pod is pretty well accomplished.I give this a 7.5/10
" loved the movie! very creative.
",2019-11-03 00:00:00,9,"Review:
When I first saw this movie I was impressed about how good the movie was made, It was all very realistic, original and I loved the props that they used and how the spaceship looked. The many rooms, the robots and the things you can do on the ship. If I was on that ship I would love all those robots and modern things you can do on the ship. I sometimes wonder if it is going to look like that in the future, cause I would definitely love to live on the Avalon myself because I just think it is so cool. I also loved the storyline.I always loved movies that were in space so I was very excited when I heard about this movie. I also thought the acting was very good. I loved the actors! The editing was also very good. And there is always something happening, it isn't boring at all. The genres were just perfect. It was romance, sci-fi, and drama. 3 things I love and go so well together. I found the end especially exiting because everything can go wrong. And even when you know it is probably going to be okay is it just scary to watch."
" Chick Flick in Space
",2019-11-02 00:00:00,1,Predictable love story with lame sci fi plot. Decent effects but not worth the time.
" When wrong is right
",2019-10-27 00:00:00,10,"Incredible how simple and yet enchanting this story is. If Jim didn't make that wrong decision, then everybody would have died, which made his decision not only right but necessary. Well acted and wrapped with an effective soundtrack, this succession of different approaches to the same situation bring me to watch Passengers again and again at home and still discover something new about humanity. Highly recommended."
" It was so close to magic
",2019-10-23 00:00:00,6,"They almost had it.
The idea could have been so much more, the execution was depressing. I truly wanted to like it.
It reminded me of when you see someone super attractive and you're like ""hot damn let's go"" And they end up being a super disappointment with so many flaws and you walk away wishing they tried a little harder. Wishing they cared more about consistency. Wishing they cared more in general."
" Don't go by the critics and enjoy the beautiful movie
",2019-10-08 00:00:00,7,"Passengers is a science fiction movie starring Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt and is directed by Morten Tyldum.The movie tells the story of 2 passengers who are awakened very early from their hibernation on a spaceship carrying passengers to another planet.After seeing the movie it would be correct to say that the critics are too harsh on the film which is a good and entertaining watch. The plot of the movie is predictable but still enjoyable. The movie also narrates the human tendency when Jim wilfully awakes Aurora as human needs a human touch to communicate, romance and to spend the entire life.The screenplay is good so as the background music. The movie could've been made more refined in terms of how the main characters repair the ship looks more dramatic. The depiction of space is also not that impressive. Climax of the movie could also have made better.Overall the movie is a nice and enjoyable movie."
" Fascinating story delivery
",2019-10-06 00:00:00,8,I can't believe how well they have presented the whole story in just one spaceship.
" It was okay, but I wish they had children in the movie.
",2019-10-05 00:00:00,7,"Imagine if the movie ended with their children running around in that garden-like ship, as the pilots find them. One older child watching the younger ones play.I think this is a part of plot the whole crew of producers didn't even think about. Children.I think there should be a second movie with the colony, and their children carrying on their story and legacy and spreading word of it."
" I had only one problem with this movie
",2019-09-17 00:00:00,10,"I loved this from beginning to end. It was not a science fiction movie per se, but i would watch it over and over again. The two leads were a true delight to watch. Passengers is one movie that had me glued. The only problem was I didn't want it to end. This has some drama, romance, adventure, and some really beautiful moments. 10/10 for me."
" Interesting premise falls short
",2019-09-15 00:00:00,5,As a sci-fi film Passengers is quite visually stunning and the effects make the film look great due to its $110 million budget. Not as great as hyped up to be. There are sone decent moments but the film turns more so into a romantic comedy/drama than an intense mysterious type a I do film. Much of the film is very much predictable.
" Good Idea - Questionable Execution
",2019-09-06 00:00:00,3,"This movie had an interesting premise, and it started well, but got off course towards the middle and barely got back on track by the end.
The idea is essentially that two people spend their lives together in blissful isolation in a technological paradise, but they're trapped there. The problem with the movie is that it misses out all the good stuff that happens between them, growing a forest, raising kids and growing old, and opts instead for 45 mins of explosions and magically fixing things.
It's the sort of movie which makes you cry to begin with, and then stunningly destroys all your expectations by resorting to a bunch of Hollywood standard narrative devices that are supposed to make the film 'exciting' but actually just ruin the whole thing. Whoever chose the music for the ending credits should be shot too.It's frustrating when Hollywood mangles a good movie, which is exactly what they did here. Why can't they respect the auteurs original vision for a movie I wonder? If this were a European movie it would have been ten times better.Nice set design. Stunning visuals etc. Basically this film got hi-jacked by idiots in the pre-planning stage."
" Amazing Idea
",2019-09-05 00:00:00,9,"This part is spoiler free:This is by far one of my favorite movies as far as concept goes. A really awesome idea brought to screen in a calculated and fun way. I'm a huge fan of Chris Pratt & Jennifer Lawrence, and them together is beautiful. Jim is a likable character with a lot of knowledge. Arora is an interesting and beautiful character. An unlikely love story in the most complex of situations. Don't listen to people saying this movie is terrible, I have a hard time understanding why. This is worth a watch, and you'll watch it more then once.SPOILERS:I'm sure I'm not the only person who would enjoy a second movie highlighting all the ups and downs of their life together alone on the Avalon. I would love to see it, even though it will never get made. But I can hope."
" Pretty original, worth watching
",2019-08-30 00:00:00,7,"A sci fi and romance movie can be hard to create but it was done pretty well in this movie. The movie is based in the future, specifically on the Avalon, a futuristic passenger spaceship on its way to a new planet for resettlement. After a seemingly small system failure, protagonist, Jim Preston (Chris Pratt), wakes up from hibernation only to find that he's the only one awake. A year later and on the brink of insanity, Jim falls in love with a woman still in hibernation. After waking Aurora up and lying about his part in, essentially, ruining her life, Jim and Aurora fall for each other. As small malfunctions around the ship become larger, Jim and Aurora's problems expand beyond their relationship as they find themselves responsible for the safety of the 5,000 lives onboard. A controversial movie with some good special effects and some great tension, Passengers is worth watching."
" Passengers
",2019-08-28 00:00:00,5,"It's beautiful, it's fun, it's got Pratt and Lawrence! Unfortunately it also has a habit of undercutting it's own emotional weight on a consistent basis by focusing on future tech spaceship porn rather than allowing things to steep long enough for decisions to really resonate. Not that it matters, because the ending does everything it can to further counteract the moral implications of the movie.The performances are still solid and the visuals are still stunning but instead of being a juicy steak to chew on, it's cotton candy. Superficial and sweet but not really satisfying."
" Not understanding the HATE for this film.
",2019-08-27 00:00:00,9,"I have seen some films that can divide opinions, and for the most part, I understand, but the level of hatred aimed at ""Passengers"" leaves me scratching my head.
I thought the story was solid and the performances of Lawrence, Pratt and particularly Sheen were phenomenal.
It was a nightmare scenario faced by Chris Pratt's character, and the decision to prematurely awaken someone to keep him company for the rest of his life on this massive ship, the AVALON was a decision almost impossible to make.
I found this film to be thoroughly enjoyable and have watched it many times.
My advice is to ignore the critics and haters and watch this film for yourself before you decide.
I almost denied myself the pleasure of this film because I was nearly dumb enough to listen to the haters. I decided to watch it anyway, regardless, and I am now so thankful I did.
I absolutely LOVED ""Passengers"", and I don't give a heck what the haters and beysayers think!"
" Rationalized fantasy.
",2019-08-16 00:00:00,8,"For the visual; the movie is stunning.
There is no parallel to the atmosphere and aura the movie offers.
It so beautifully unfolds the fact unfavourable and unwanted circumstances can be turned into a beautiful experience only if we decide to live the present instead of lamenting about what has been lost.
You see it's like we cannot undo what has been done, the only thing that can be done is to seize the moment we're living in."
" Frustrating at best, painful at worst
",2019-08-12 00:00:00,3,"I have never been more frustrated with a film more than Passengers (2016). Large leaps in logic, underusage of a fantastic premise, cheesy direction-- these complaints don't even scrape the surface of the mess that is this movie. In an era where we get thought provoking science fiction films such as Moon, Blade Runner 2049, Upgrade, and Annihilation, somehow people decide to enjoy this film. It truly baffles me that a viewer could be so roped in by characters as bland as these. Its cinematography, its direction, its performances, its themes are so quickly forgotten. In fact, the only thing I truly do remember about this film is how angry it made me when I was when watching it.The critics got it right. This film is void of tension, enjoyability, and inventiveness."
" Loneliness in life, in space..good story and well acted
",2019-08-11 00:00:00,7,"I found passengers a good romantic film with both the lead cast playing their roles superbly, especially Jennifer Lawrence who was excellent. With only a handful of actors in the film, the movie still moves at a good pace and I was always waiting to see what happens next. The last 30 mins could seem a little contrived but the ending seems apt.Also, the whole layout of the futuristic spaceship has to be seen to be believed.A love story in space...recommended watch."

" Missed 1 huge thing!
",2019-08-06 00:00:00,7,Everything was progessing along nice.... and I thought this could be a great movie.... until the very end!! They were lovers for years and no kids? Did they use birth control ? I'm so confused! This should of been discussed on screen to explain what happened there... How they prevented pregnancy etc. I was expecting to see their kids emerge and how they grew up on the ship over the years etc.
" Broadening the appeal of Sci-Fi
",2019-08-05 00:00:00,7,"Passengers (2016)
Very credible Sci-Fi. It's asking an enormous, enormous amount for 2 (3) actors to carry a two hour movie and this is its biggest triumph. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawerence are eminently engaging and endlessly watchable.
The space and science are largely believable. The dialogue and interactions work. The structure and tonal balance work.
It asks plenty of questions among others just why did anyone get on board and questions of humanity.
The film rests upon their relationship and its up to you whether this examination survives the duration but it did....just...for me, or at least I could buy it.
I felt he last 3 or 4 minutes could have been explored differently or to be honest, just explored, but maybe short and sweet was for the best rather than further ""work(ing) the problem"".
It's not its fault that it isn't the searing Sci-Fi of Arrival, the all things to everyone of The Martian or have the peril of say Gravity.
I think it's a genuine feat that this movie will acceptably cross genres and have a greater appeal than one could imagine. Broadening the appeal of a setting I love can't be a bad thing.

" Great film
",2019-06-21 00:00:00,10,"I don't get people complaining about too happy ending. There are enough depressing and sad moments in this film.Anyway, I've noticed minor but quite apparent plot hole. The ship's AI wasn't smart enough to even land on a planet, so there should exist some kind of fail-safe mechanism in case of troubles during travel. For instance, member / members of the crew should be woken up so they could decide what to do next. All that was needed was a brief mention that such system existed but failed, too."
" Intelligent SciFi
",2019-06-20 00:00:00,9,"Since the beginning of ""moving pictures"" about 150 years ago by now, there have been precious few good hard Science Fiction stories on screen. I have most of the historical masterpieces and milestones in a small (!) DVD collection. This movie is absolutely in that elusive bunch. The characters are interesting and humanly real with their flaws and strengths. The story? It starts with what the previews reveal, so no surprise there, but things go in unexpected directions from there. It is about human nature, our possible reactions in a bad situation, and intelligent behaviour instead of shootem-up, which is not possible and would be insane in the given situation. There are (wonderfully refreshing!) no slimy aliens or zombies, and yet the tale keeps you watching and rooting for the people on board a ship beyond reach of any rescue. Despite the novel and slick design, for the most part they even got the current physics right and the imaginary future solutions for some space related problems are even being worked on now. Ok, so they goofed on a few details, especially the zero-G effect failure, but which movie has not had its flaws in physics? That is why there is one star missing in the rating, but otherwise kudos! This is a believable involuntary adventure story, that is well made, with very good actors, and visually appealing in a way that will stand the test of time. Cinematography is excellent and avoids ""modern"" camera styles that only annoy and hurt my eyes (no jiggle camera, no incessant zoomie-zoom, no wanna-be documentary ""style', etc). Oh, and for special effects, they are of course there, are not obnoxiously in the foreground, but simply build the scenery. They are of a nature, where you forget about them and you just see the drama unfold instead, which is what GOOD use of FX is all about :) I totally love this masterpiece!"
" Sci Fantastic
",2019-06-19 00:00:00,8,This is a very well produced Sci Fi movie that kept me thinking. I was very engaged throughout the movie. I was also pleasantly surprised by the acting chops of both J Law and CP. They had real chemistry in the movie. The visual and audio production in this film are second to none. I thoroughly enjoyed it and even liked the storybook ending.
" Underrated movie
",2019-06-13 00:00:00,8,"Forget the metacritic reviews. This movie worth a lot more than a 4/10.
It is not an action movie or some kind of Alien horror titles. The movie is well balanced and very well produced. Actors are flawless. Everything is made to be an enjoyable movie with some kind of moral. Life has no sens so why people try to be someone they never gonna be. Just live the present. All you need is around you. It is some kind of total dream situations in a spaceship. It is a pure fictional movie with an happy ending and many tensions happening at the right moment. Very good script. The spaceship is a very beautiful environement. It is maybe an existing place on earth. How it is possible to say something wrong about this movie? Nothing is wrong at all. So in short .. Don't expect an action movie with Aliens eveywhere or super heros it is clearly not that kind of movie but it is a good very well made pop movie no doubt on that."
" Underrated Movie
",2019-06-10 00:00:00,10,"Do not believe the bad reviews. This is a good film which is well cast. Chris Pratt, in particular, shows his range. He goes beyond a simple funny man and demonstrates real emotion.This is an amazing story about humans and our need for social interaction. Man or woman, anyone in this situation would eventually wake up another person. The loneliness would drive anyone crazy. Given enough time they would let someone out just to end the isolation. You really cannot blame the person at that point."

The thought process from begging to end is one of the best put together romantic sci-fi movies I've ever seen. The plot (predictable or not) made me feel like I need to develop my talents ASAP & having a talent though maybe not in space does help us in using our time wisely, and everything from human to machine was thought out perfectly. It makes u think about ""what would u do"" situations so much that u want to develop your talents ASAP. At the same time learning all about every human emotion we have on a daily bases. I'll never get over the detail in every possible way imaged in this film 2 thumbs 4Stars"
" Excellent in every way!
",2019-06-06 00:00:00,10,"If you approach a review with the intention of deleting a star or points based on flaws, then it's genuinely difficult to give this movie less than 10 stars.The story is interesting, the science is plausible, the acting is first rate and the actors have genuine chemistry.

",2019-05-25 00:00:00,8,"I found Jennifer Lawrence's acting distractingly bad and over-the-top. It FELT like acting, and that's no good. I think had it been a better actress I would've given it a 10. Other than that, I liked the style, the visuals, and the story. Chris Pratt made me sympathize with his character's decision."
" These are not robot questions
",2019-05-24 00:00:00,5,"The premise of this sci-fi romance/drama had potential. During an interstellar voyage, passenger Jim (Chris Pratt) wakes up from hibernation 90 years before the arrival due to a system error. He is the only person awake on the whole gigantic spaceship apart from a robot bartender (Michael Sheen), while all other thousands human passengers are still asleep in hibernation. After useless attempts to repair his pod, Jim briefly enjoys the luxurious life aboard before loneliness nearly drives him suicidal.At this point he decides to awake an attractive female passenger, Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence), to have some company in his hopeless situation...I've heard people complain that the premise is creepy, but that's the whole point. If you take away Jim's moral dilemma and selfish choice, and have both passengers awake due to random circustances, you get the most boring movie imaginable (and it's not as if Passengers right now is incredibly lively and exciting).MAJOR SPOILERS Sadly, Passengers chickens out in a last act where the two leads cooperate to save the ship, the morally dubious Jim becomes flat-out heroic, Aurora forgives him and the two live together their remaining years in a bittersweet conclusion which is far too sweet and not nearly bitter enough.
The premise was screaming for something darker, like Aurora going to sleep on the repaired pod and Jim resigning himself to loneliness; even better, Jim
dies and a half-crazed Aurora, now alone on the ship for months in the same situation as Jim was, starts eyeing the pod with a handsome male passenger, implying the cycle of selfishness and deception may soon start again. END SPOILERSProduction values are solid; the leads are fine and so are Sheen and Laurence Fishburne in the only relevant supporting roles. Pity about that last act.5,5/10"
" Interesting concept, mildly entertaining movie
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,6,An exciting and intriguing premise that was ruined by the trailer and screenplay. This movie would have been fantastic if the movie was just like the trailer- both passengers wake up at the same. The more twisted option- the audience not finding out that Chris Pratt's character woke Jennifer Lawrence's character up until the same time she finds out.
" A thinker
",2019-05-12 00:00:00,7,"For a SF film, Passengers is on the calm side, yet still evocative. It's about two people together in space under far from ideal great circumstances. Its plot centers around a moral choice that is as inevitable as it is impossible, which gives this relatively romantic movie an underlying tension throughout. And that's all I can say without spoilers.Jennifer Lawrence steals the show in the acting category and Chris Pratt knows his place by giving her the limelight, which is the mark of a great actor. Others (no spoilers) compliment perfectly. The plot however is a little predictable. You can really see some story beats coming miles away. Although later, the tempo and twist become more interesting.The music is quite bad and cliched but the atmosphere, filming and art direction are strong throughout. And the central premise is so good that you can't help thinking: what would I do?"
" Michael Sheen should be awarded best supporting act for this
",2019-05-04 00:00:00,9,"Coming back to this movie I am still in awe about how flawless Michael Sheen was able to portrait a robot bartender.
It was in fact so perfect that when I left the theater after the movie, I was convinced, that there only had been three actors involved at first. (Lawrence, Pratt and Fishburn).
It took me about an hour to realize that there infact were 4 main actors and that Michael Sheen was one of them.
His acting is so spot on, that I was convinced watching a robot throughout the whole movie.
I never experienced anything like this, watching a movie. This is top notch acting.And if this isn't enough, the actual plot of a movie, of somebody totally desperate, being utterly alone is really intriguing. And seeing the spacewalk scenes on a big screen was breathtaking too."
" TBD
",2019-05-04 00:00:00,5,"Watched this movie tonight and straightaway writing a review just after that while the feelings are fresh in my mind.This is a romantic sci-fi movie and runs between two main characters Jim and Aurora. The things which I liked about this movie are the graphics and cinematography, I was able to live few hours of my life in the beauty of a bigger world out there. The stars and the galaxies always enchanted me and the movie does justice to capture the magnificence in few scenes, well done. Apart from this it is a normal romantic movie with predictable storyline and unimpressive ending. I guess, most space movies end with an imminent danger and how leads have out of box ideas to save the ship. Have seen this concept in many many other movies. I liked the female lead, Jennifer Lawrence, she is beautiful and can see why Chris Pratt fell in love with her. Lawrence Fishburne was given a cameo role and I feel he could have got more screen time and more powerful role. The movie did injustice to his acting abilities. Chris Pratt, hmm., nothing special about him, regular guy who tries to find meaning to his existence on a space ship without any mission in his life. If I compare him with Matt Damon from the martian, his character didn't impress me. Regarding the robots, I liked the all full medical diagnostic and full operating machine, wish we could build them in real world, the world will be better off with it. Overall, I would rate it under time pass category and will watch it under subscription. Don't bother paying separately for it. Cheers!"
" Romance in a spaceship.
",2019-05-02 00:00:00,9,I really liked this movie. Kind of slow in parts but not to much can really happen when he is on the ship by himself for so long. It had the sci-fy element of being in space- which I have a tendency to prefer those types when I just want to be entertained. Husband said it was ok---he really prefers action movies. I liked it had a little romance. Kept my attention.
" I don't get critics
",2019-04-30 00:00:00,8,"Why is there such a disconnect between critics and fans? This was such a great movie. Good characters, really innovative story. I know *why* some people have negative feelings towards it, but I *totally disagree* with it. Yet another example of how pessimism is ruining good things."
" Interstellar for dummies
",2019-04-19 00:00:00,1,"Has some potential, but mediocre acting anad shallow script made just an Interstellar for dummies. Whoever wrote the script...did he ever had some physic and biology lessons in high school?! What a dumm movie. Waste of time and money."
" Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence have terrific chemistry.
",2019-04-19 00:00:00,7,"Pratt, Lawrence and the superficial aspects of the story, along with the gorgeous aesthetic, are compelling enough to make Passengers at the very least interesting, and not a waste of your time."
" Glossy Twaddle
",2019-04-17 00:00:00,3,"Chris Pratt is always watchable but I can't think of him without thinking of Parks and Rec. What is Andy doing in space? Where are April and Ron? This movie just about gets by without them but the supporting cast is pretty, pretty slight that is, just two and a half really. In fact the ""half"" is half the fun...
Maybe the best way to engage with this film is to not think too hard and just play a game of spotting the movie allusions like The Shining and Silent Running maybe TV too like Red Dwarf.
Hate to think how they expected us to swallow the plot such as it is tho. In fact Andy sorry, Jim, is the monster stalking the lonely corridors of a deluxe space ark with his steerage class wristband. No wonder he feels aggrieved and yearns for a friend. He finds one but he is just another serving appliance, a glorified drinks machine...
Maybe he is not a monster. After all what would any of us do in this extremely unlikely situation of having the pick of your next mate? Why, we would pick the cutest we could find of course... On a tangential thought, what would we make of this plot were the roles swopped, Lawrence the first passenger to be woken up...?
Anyway, there was enough here to suggest it for a rainy Sunday afternoon but while it entertains it also irritates hence my low score. It was too long too. And why the title? Kind of simplistic and unhelpful... Iggy Pop's song is not heard in this movie so don't worry. Whether you liked the ending is down to you but I thought it was a bit inevitable and flat... it could only ever end in tears so think twice when you sign up for that ""colony world"" exit from manky Planet Earth!"
" Almost perfect is perfect enough for me...
",2019-04-17 00:00:00,9,"Pay close attention to the words that are said and when they are said and the body language of the actors. This script is a master class in foreshadowing. Some people do not like foreshadowing. When it's done well, I love it, and Passengers is one of the best at it. Jennifer and Chris both perform their characters with genuine humanity. I took one star from ten because of the deus ex machina of introducing Gus only to kill him off almost immediately because they needed his ability to access the crew only parts of the ship. The ending was good, but I really was expecting Aurora to get into the AutoDoc and get a ""Congratulations You're Pregnant!"" and then they would name the boy after Gus."
" Terribly conflicted
",2019-04-16 00:00:00,7,"I'm giving this 7/10 because the story is interesting - in parts - and the visual style is truly beautiful.
I was entertained throughout and found the tragedy of isolation and the drama in the final act quite compelling but the lead actors were AWFUL, and it really detracted from my total enjoyment.
It also bounced between love story and sci-fi in a clumsy way.
Compelling but also annoying as it should've picked a lane, and much better actors."
" ""I'm scared -- I'm fighting to stay calm""
",2019-04-15 00:00:00,7,"Technology will continue its inexorable advance, but Adam will never stop desiring an Eve.With an age-old plot line clothed in the flashiest of high-tech wrappings, along with excellent casting and acting, ""Passengers"" makes for one of the more satisfying space movies in memory.Here we've got the story of working joe Jim Preston (Chris Pratt), who is hurtling at half the speed of light toward a colony of humans on a faraway space body. Upon awakening 90 years prematurely from what was supposed to be a 120-year hibernation, with 5,000 other passengers slumbering around him according to plan, Jim wrestles over whether to awaken fellow traveler Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence) -- offering himself the hope of companionship but killing her chances of achieving intergalactic emigration.I appreciated this movie's emphasis on characterization over high-tech jargon and special effects, although many scenes are visually riveting (i.e. when a sudden drop in gravity turns the spaceship's swimming pool into a life-threatening vortex).I was unfamiliar with Pratt, but he turns in a nuanced performance here, bringing to mind fellow film hunks Josh Brolin and Christian Bale. I also liked the work of Ms. Lawrence, who believably goes from liking Jim, to wanting to kill him, to finally realizing that she wouldn't want to live without him. Also good are Laurence Fishburne in the small role of unflappable control-room techie Gus Mancuso and Andy Garcia in a cameo as the spaceship's captain.This film poses some intriguing moral questions while poking fun at the limitations of technology. (Anyone who thinks a robot could ever replace a friend will be disabused of the notion here.) We also get some commentary on the commercialization that would inevitably follow man into the far reaches of the multiverse. For example, we learn that Jim didn't have to pay full fare for his ride to another world -- ""I'm in a desirable trade,"" he tells Aurora. That translates into cheaper, duller food than Aurora gets at the spaceship breakfast bar.We also observe a tweaking of the notion that technology can be trusted. Hibernation pods on the Avalon were supposed to be fail-safe. But if they had been, there wouldn't have been any story here.In the end, this is a poignant tale about the human condition. People can careen erratically between love and enmity. But in the end, all we've really got is each other. ""It ain't right,"" a world-weary Gus tells Aurora, ""but the drowning man will always try to drag someone down with him."" Ain't it the truth!"
" Lost and found love in space

" Contrived, predictable, and boring
",2019-04-11 00:00:00,4,"Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) awakens from hibernation 30 years into a 120 year interstellar journey. Lonely, he decides to awaken Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence) over whom he has begun to obsess. After some angst, the two of them enjoy life in their starship Hilton until a cascade of ever-worsening glitches starts to impact their idyllic existence. Ignore the apologists who are 'correcting' goofs, this film is so full of plot holes that it might as well be an adolescent's 'hot chick and a star ship' fantasy. The entire plot hangs on a series of convenient but implausible situations: no one is supposed to be awake, but every passenger service in the ship is up and running when Preston's pod fails: the ship carries all the necessary spare parts (at least those needed to advance the plot), but despite damage and failing systems, doesn't awaken a repair team; there are 5000 passengers but only one 'autodoc' (and one bar tender), etc. The entire story revolves around Jim and Aurora, but neither the actors nor their characters are very engaging or interesting, the script is trite, and the 'race against time' climax is formulaic, predictable, and entirely unconvincing. The special effects and 'sets' are spectacular (even if the physics is a bit shaky) but they're wasted buttressing up an insipid story. The film has been likened to ""Titanic"" (1997) and will likely be enjoyed by people who preferred the 'Rose and Jack' story to the 'sinking ship' story."
" WOW! What a pleasant surprise!
",2019-04-10 00:00:00,10,"So this movie has been sitting on my shelf for at least a year, and no doubt because of the critic's reviews! But I loved every moment.

" Stunning visuals, good performances, hokey resolution
",2019-03-24 00:00:00,6,"Since Star Wars, science fiction films have been compelled to wow us visually with special effects, each topping the previous with its display of grand things outside our current experience. (Unfortunately often at the neglect of plor, characterization, etc., but that's a different rant.) Passengers is a success here.Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence are both highly talented actors, and they both did good jobs here. Quite believable, both of them.I found pacing of the movie unsatisfying, too much time spent on build up - scene setting and buildup of the budding romance - until finally getting into the drama of danger and its resolution.The background story of a company making sesquigazillions in money off colonizing planets that take hundreds of years for trips leaves me skeptical, but I'm willing to give that a bit of a break because its just backstory to set the scene.My biggest complaint though is the idea of this one man being able to able to pull off saving the ship as he did. The idea is, well, he's a mechanic so he can fix stuff. The earlier part where he finds and reads a manual to figure out how to do things, OK, but coming into the climax where he has to figure out what is wrong with the ship and how to fix it, what are they going to do? I kid you not, ""Look for something that's broken."" Open a cabinet of electronics and look at it and say, ""That looks OK"". And then when they finally find the source of the problem (I'm trying very hard not to do spoilers here), under intense time pressure (so no time to read maintenance manuals) he instantly knows what has to be done and how and where.Kinda spoiled it for me. Not sorry I watched it on TV, but if I had paid for it in a movie theater I would have been disappointed."
" Morten Tyldum
",2019-03-12 00:00:00,10,Morten Tyldum is in my opinion one of the best film directors in recent years.
" Ignore negative reviews
",2019-03-09 00:00:00,10,"I seldom write reviews but it'd be a sin not to do so for a movie thats so enjoyable and touching. I am sure of some conspiracy behind the negative critic reviews for such a great movie. The story is so fresh and the situation is so new and unexpected that you're surely going to love it. If you ever have loved someone to the extreme, am sure you won't be disappointed watching this movie and its going to remain close to your heart for long."
" An excuse to have Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence star in a movie together.
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,5,"I have to admit that the plot presented in the trailers of this movie intrigued me. However, in its execution, Passengers (2016) left much to be desired. Of course, this was mostly due to the film using just enough ""physics speak"" to be partially accurate, but incredibly wrong. Those parts stuck out to me in this movie and I kept scratching my head while watching it and saying, ""Wait a minute . . ."" That being said, not all of Passengers was bad, just a pretty big chunk of it.I did appreciate the moral conundrum that Jim (Chris Pratt) encountered in the movie's first act. It did add a bit of predictable drama to the characters, but depicting his struggle highlighted his humanity. In this plot with a clear three-act structure, this first act was the highlight that eventually devolved into a ridiculous setup for the final reveal. With each new character introduced, the tension increased in each act. And yet, I wondered if the spacecraft could have even survived that long given the issues it had.In a story that initially felt like The Martian (2015), with bits of WALL-E (2008) mixed in (especially with Thomas Newman's musical score for both Passengers and WALL-E), the scientist in me could not ignore a few key aspects of this film. First, a simple Wolfram Alpha search will tell you that it would take 73 years to reach Arcturus at ½ light speed, not 30. Second, for a spaceship that is rotating, why would it need to have a separate ""gravity drive"" to keep things in place (other than to make me wonder why the gravity was strangely perpendicular to the rotation)? Finally, the spaceship was clearly accelerating the entire time, so I wonder if the ½ light speed velocity was at that point or during the whole duration of the current flight. All glaring disobediences to the laws of physics.An excuse to have Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence star in a movie together, I give Passengers 2.5 stars out of 5."
" Incredible movie. Beautifull images as you yourself would see space and perfect love story
",2019-03-06 00:00:00,10,"I normaly do not write reviews that much, but this is an exception.
First off all the perfect music /theme for the movie in combination with the view of the stars. Secondly, for ones no cowboys and indians, like star wars but a believable storyline as could take place in a couple of hunderd years. Thirdly the actors are great, especially the weighter (android) who gave a great performance as expected how a robot would react.
I have seen the movie twice in the scenema in 3d bought the movie in 3d and 4k. You're just watching for the view of endless beautifull space over and over again.
Also beatifull to hear the soundtrack over and over again with a headphone. You feel space.
Sorry for the faults in writing. I am not english!"
" One part Stockholm syndrome, one part gaslighting.
",2019-03-06 00:00:00,1,"I won't bother with a full review. This is a story about a man completely manipulating a woman's life for his own selfish desires. This is a rape story. Had it acknowledged this and not masqueraded as a ""romance,"" then it might have been something worthwhile. But it's not."
" One of my personal favorite movies!
",2019-03-04 00:00:00,10,"I don't write reviews that often, but I loved this movie. It is in my top 10 list of favorite sci-fi movies. (For perspective some other favs include: The Matrix, Oblivion, The Edge of Tomorrow, Interstellar, The Martian).This movie combines spectacular CGI with a gripping and fascinating storyline and a love story to boot! The plot may on the surface seem like just a futuristic ""stranded on a deserted island theme"" but it is so much more than that. There a multiple plot elements that really fascinate me including the ideas of interstellar travel, colonizing a new world, as well as the emotions and thoughts that come from the idea of being stranded alone for the rest of your life.I truly felt like the director did a great job of weaving all of these elements together along with some amazing visuals and special effects and a wonderful musical score. I highly, highly recommend this movie."
" Épic
",2019-03-04 00:00:00,8,Great epic journey through the stars. the film evolve from a lonely experience in a luxury ship to an love adventure to a life and death situation. Great ship and special affects. A bit annoyed that Jim speaks spanish but no french.
" Script by Jon Spaihts saves the day
",2019-03-02 00:00:00,6,"... or perhaps rather the premise of the filmIn ""Passengers"", Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence both played their lead parts very well, as did supporting Laurence Fishburne. Lots of CGI. I think the movie would have benefited greatly from the use of practical effects rather than relying heavily on CGI, especially on the robots.Did I find ""Passengers"" entertaining? Yes, the interesting premise made sure of that.Was I impressed, surprised, moved, or remotely touched by it? Most certainly not."
" predictable but still good
",2019-02-28 00:00:00,7,"The movie is nothing unusual and nothing so special but it doesn't bore you. Yes, it's a bit cheesy. And yes, it's not the best film ever made. BUT the effects are good and there's humor and a great chemistry between the main characters. It's nice because it makes you laugh and in the same time you can think about some perspectives of our lives. So it's definitely not bad but don't expect the greatest story."
" Sci-fi yet unique love story
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,8,It's really a nice movie to watch. I thought 2nd half might be boring compared to 1st half after breakup. But there are so many twists and turns in the 2nd half and you'll feel a true essence of love in between. It is a real feel good movie.
" Beautiful; let down by the marketing
",2019-02-22 00:00:00,9,"This movie is an underrated gem that was unfortunately let down by the marketing.I've seen a number of criticisms that the movie is 'boring' and 'nothing happens', and from what I remember the trailers did promise a suspenseful, action-packed sci-fi adventure.That's not what this movie is about.Passengers is a beautiful, slow-paced story about a man who is facing a lifetime of total isolation. It takes its time exploring his desperation, distractions and despair before sidestepping into a love story between two characters who are surprisingly genuine, and who manage to be sympathetic even when they're being immoral.The movie is atmospheric above all else with fantastic acting and a haunting score, but I never felt that it dragged, and I was invested in the story from beginning to end.I'm so glad that I ignored the critics and gave this movie a chance - it's so much better than I expected."
" Realistic, thoughtful, enjoayable, and exciting
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,10,"Much better than the shallow shoot'em-and-die space movies. That doesn't mean it's slow paced or head in the philosophical clouds. I think people will enjoy this compared to the more ""fantastical"" universe-phenomena movies."
" Decent
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,8,"Visuals are great, good start, drags a bit in the middle. Endings is ok. Fair film to watch for a Saturday night"
" Beautiful love story
",2019-02-05 00:00:00,8,"I focused on the love. One man woke up in the spaceship. He was sleeping in the cold box. He was gonna wake up 90 years late. It means that he must alive alone until dead. Actually, he made a living by himself for a year. However, it's not continue. He needed other people, so he woke a woman up.
Then, they got good relationship each other. But, after that, she knew he woke her up. She was angry. She disrespected him. Their relationship was worst.
One day, the spaceship was broken. He dicided that he fixed it to use his life. When it happen, she knew she still loved him.
At the end, they fixed the ship. Then, they lived only two."
" Awful.
",2019-02-03 00:00:00,1,"It seems, the producer's have decided to suck some money from the audience once again. And once again, unfinished sloppy script, awful acting, terrible directing. The film that would be forgotten within couple of years. Bad. Terrible, awful."
" Visually stunning, enjoyable despite critics
",2019-02-01 00:00:00,9,"I have never bothered reviewing a film before, but this is a case where my experience diverged so significantly from the critics that I felt compelled to share. Judging by the IMDB user reviews, I can clearly see that I am not alone.All else aside, the glitteringly beautiful set design and excellent soundtrack are reasons enough to see Passengers. The fact that this film is relatively minimalist (revolving mostly around 2-3 actors) allows the viewer to really notice the details during the sweeping scenes of the various interiors and rooms of the ""Avalon."" The sense of the ship's endless span (conveyed especially in the early scenes of the film) set against the backdrop of space are lent additional lustre by the soundtrack (excellently composed by Thomas Newman). The soundtrack shows up front and centre (again, due to the film's minimal nature), but always feels in sync with what's happening onscreen.The premise of the early part of the film (""If you were stranded on a desert island, would you wish another person there with you?"") is intriguing in itself. You might struggle to convince yourself that in the same place, you'd react any differently. This premise is the reason I would hesitate to rigorously characterize this film as ""sci-fi"" in genre. As such, I think Passengers should be spared any of the nitpicks regarding scientific or physical accuracy/realism. It's simply not the point.One weakness I have to point out (the reason that I rated the film 9/10 rather than 10/10) is in the pacing, which feels a bit uneven going into the third act. Throughout the film one has a faint sense of acceleration in the storyline. It felt as if the second act was chasing the third (and the ensuing climax of the story), somewhat at the expense of the more dramatically interesting elements. With a runtime of just under two hours, the director definitely had at least some wiggle-room to draw out key plot points a bit more gently and evenly. This, however, is nowhere near enough of a reason not to watch it. Overall, it's visually beautiful and emotionally satisfying, even if a little fast."
" My Favorite Movie of all time
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,10,"So beautifully done , the specials effects are amazing , the acting is spot on ,I could watch this movie again and again and again 😊❤❤❤"
" A good movie
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,7,It is nice 2hours time pass movie. A good watch but nothing woww in it. A romantic movie without toooo much of romance
" CHEER! - (9 stars out of 10)
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,9,"The stage curtains open ...We find ourselves on board a very modern, high-tech spaceship transporting over 5,000 sleeping passengers, each in their own state-of-the-art hibernation pods, to a planet that will take 120 years to reach. When the ship sustains damage from an asteroid, one of the pods malfunctions, waking up Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) - a mechanic crew member. The only problem is, it is 90 years too early. Realizing his demise, he tries to make the best of it - lasting a full year before he begins to contemplate suicide. But then, he notices a beautiful woman (Jennifer Lawrence), safe and hibernating in her pod - and his longing for human companionship causes him to do the unthinkable.The stage is set for one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Chris Pratt is completely convincing in his isolation - you really care for him and his plight. You understand the reasons behind his decisions though you may or may not agree with them. Jennifer Lawrence also was strong in her role and the chemistry between them works. The camera work is solid, the F/X engaging ... this is a good movie.Some have stated that they hated the ending to this movie and without divulging anything, I will only say this: she had a way out - it was not hopeless. If you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend it. A fast favorite."
" A Typical Sci Fi Movie With Emphasis
",2019-01-11 00:00:00,7,"18 March 2017. Visually on the spaceship, one could be reminded of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) including a phone call, Alien (1979) and hibernation chambers, and even a robot from The First Spaceship on Venus (1960). Unfortunately there are no real interesting twists one might expect and the sci fi script plays more like a toned down Gravity (2013) with a relationship angle. What makes this sci fi movie a bit better than the average outer space adventure is the personal character development and moral dilemma that was given good screen time. Even so the American nature of romantic drama abounds in this movie. Entertaining, though slow at times, and could have been better. The ending scene, however, was a nice touch and almost redeemed the movie."
" It sucked me in from the start.
",2019-01-08 00:00:00,9,"I often tell my family that there are only a few films made each year that are really worth watching. This is certainly one of them. Such an original story, excellent special effects and realistic drama. Thanks to all involved in the making of the film. Writers. special effects and actors. I think I need to go and watch this on a big screen if I get the chance. I have to put this up in my top ten films. Blade Runner, 2001 A Space Odyssey, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Ground Hog Day, Papillon and others."
" i love this kind of a movie
",2019-01-07 00:00:00,8,"Its just refreshing to see a movie that creates tension without too much action. the characters are beautifully developing, there are phantastic effects and the storyline is clever and entertaining. id give it a solid 9, sad to say the last 30minutes are a waste of time since the director felt the urge to create some unrealistic action/drama - anyway great movie"
" Loved this. Made me cry.
",2019-01-07 00:00:00,9,"I love sci fi and I love a good love story so as this combined the two so I couldn't go wrong. Wanted to watch it with my wife but she is so anti sci fi, she passed up the opportunity. The cast is tiny, but what a cast. Really enjoyed it. Nough said."
" WOW!!!
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,8,"Really great movie. Wasnt quite sure what to expect but was pleasently surprised. I was really able to enotionally connect to Lawrence and Pratt's characters, their great acting helped. Plus the world building was great and i absolutely loved the ship they were on. The movie made me even tear up at some parts. Overall a very special movie and definately one of my new favourites."
" Could have been so much better
",2019-01-04 00:00:00,5,"The premise of this film is actually pretty great, but the execution just comes off as frustratingly conventional because PASSENGERS chooses to play its concept safe in every respect.The story of two people being isolated in a luxurious spaceship for the rest of their lives could have made for so many interesting statements about the fulfillment and our expectations of life, but the film just briefly touches these aspects during the last ten minutes and leaves the viewer with a cheesy and, most of all, lazy ending.The character interactions also squander so much potential because the film doesn't take its time in the important moments and instead shows us Chris Pratt playing futuristic basketball by himself for the first 30 minutes. Besides, the script missed the opportunity to easily increase the suspense with not starting the film from Jennifer Lawrence's point of view, leaving it to the viewer to find out the truth about her early awakening.All in all, this concept could have made for a great low budget indie film similar to Duncan Jones' MOON, but it just comes off as a boring mess within the scope of a blockbuster movie."
" Interesting premiss becomes a routine sinking ship survival tale
",2019-01-04 00:00:00,4,"Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt make a handsome couple in this sci-fi version of a desert island romance (think ""Blue Lagoon"" or ""Swept Away"" in space), but the film ultimately fizzles on a promising premiss and becomes a routine sinking spaceship story that is no ""Titanic."" 5000 passengers are aboard a space cruiser on a 120 year trip to a distant plant called Homestead II when Pratt finds himself unexpectedly woken up from his sleep chamber about 90 years too soon. Pratt goes a little crazy all alone on the massive ship, growing a bear, walking around naked, and basically losing his mind (think Tom Hanks in ""Castaway""), when he hits on the idea of waking up another passenger. Enter Jennifer Lawrence, who he wakes from her sleep, but doesn't tell her he woke her, instead blaming the faulty ship. Can their romance survive such a huge lie? Pratt's decision to wake her was essentially sentencing her to die with him, so should he ever tell her the truth or should he live with the lie? That kind of story is ripe with possibilities and almost reaches Andrei Tarkovsky ""Solaris"" levels of smart science fiction, but instead those emotional, ethical, and moral implications are barely addressed and the plot instead quickly shifts into a routine ""THE SHIP IS FAILING"" storyline where the two have to try to save their slumbering fellow passengers from dying in their sleep. If this was a desert island romance film, the equivalent would be the happy couple spending most of the film fighting pirates and completely ignoring the first half of the film's intriguing set-up. Considering the likable stars, a strong story premiss, and the lavish production values, this film was a real missed opportunity."
" Fantastic film - Drama, romance, suspense, scifi ...
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,8,"I'd never heard of this film until I stumbled across it on Netflix. My loss! This is a beautifully woven story set in deep space.There's nothing overdone, just a beautiful symphony of parts coming together to make a fantastic whole. There are few things that break you out of the reality created for you by the director Morten Tyldum.Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence work well together, ably supported by Lawrence Fishburne, and Martin Sheen, in a rather surprising guise.This film leaves its mark on you and is well worth rewatching."
" This is a deeper film than most people realized -- it's more than just a glossy sci-fi ride.
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,7,"The interstellar starship is one of the major science-fiction tropes. If, as ""Passengers"" does, you decide to go with the laws of physics and accept sub-light-speed, then it means taking decades or centuries to go between stars. So then, either you put your crew and passengers into hibernation and completely automate the ship; or else build a ship that people can live in for generations -- so that most of the passengers will live out their whole lives on it and never see the final destination. ""Passengers"" effectively invites us to see what both possibilities would be like.In either case the ship has to be BIG, and the one designed for this film is a beauty. It gets lots of screen time too, and for me it was almost the star of the show. (It's fun comparing it with the nicely done interPLANETARY ships for other space movies like ""The Martian"", ""2010"", or the iconic ""2001"" -- interstellar is a whole different category of complexity.) In general, the sets for both interiors and exterior are well worked out.(Caution: some spoilers ahead. My comments will make more sense if you've already seen the film.)By contrast with the ship, the storyline and the cast of characters are pared down to an absolute minimum while it confronts us with some challenging moral issues. Some years into the voyage to a new colony, Something Goes Wrong -- the ship passes through a cloud of meteroids that partially damage the ship's systems. (Science detour here -- deep interstellar space isn't like an asteroid belt and it shouldn't have much more than sparse gas and dust, not big hunks of rock. They might have found another plot device to get the same result.) A single random passenger, mechanic Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) is accidentally woken from hibernation. The voyage still has 88 years to go. The crew, who might be able to fix tings, are also in hibernation and inaccessible within a sealed area, so he's facing the rest of his life being completely alone (not counting the robot bartender Arthur (Michael Sheen), who's not exactly a substitute for human companionship). More than a year goes by. After agonizing with himself for a very long time, he awakens Aurora Lane, a journalist (Jennifer Lawrence), who then goes through her own cycle of denial/rage/bargaining/acceptance, and of course eventually finds out what he did. Their relationship, which up to that point was starting to go well, predictably breaks down. This is where things might stick, except that the ship's systems are getting gradually worse and clearly something needs to be done. Jumping to the end, the obligatory final action scenes lead them to the ship being restored (with some crucial and unexpected help) and bring the plot to a satisfying, though not completely expected, finish.Jim's decision to awaken Aurora, which is the critical point of the plot, sparked some real controversy around this film. Is his action morally equivalent to murder? Not really. Or rape? Not exactly. Maybe something like abduction??? Yes, it was a personal violation that prevents Aurora from having the life she planned for. Is Jim's decision inexcusable, as many viewers felt? Is it inexcusable but yet understandable? Probably most people would agree that he'd have been justified in awakening some of the crew, because the lives of all the thousands of people on board are in jeopardy. But that's what he (correctly) tried first and was unable to do. What would the audience reaction have been if the tables were turned such that she awoke first and then brought him out? Are the situations equivalent? I think the film is inviting us to visualize ourselves in their places: Jim knows this step is somehow wrong, but otherwise he's facing decades of utter loneliness, maybe madness, or suicide. What would we do? It's an extraordinary situation that no one in today's world has actually had to deal with. There are echos here of the archetypal Adam and Eve story, but there's no God and no Satan, just impersonal forces represented by the ship and the universe outside.However, I think that a discussion over the morality of all this must also include the ending. Almost beyond hope the chance comes to at least partially recover. With the ship back to full functionality, they find that it will be possible to use the auto-doc to restart hibernation -- but for just one of them, because the other one has to set it running. Jim offers to do it for Aurora, and now she has a free choice: shall she opt to get her original life plan back again, or to stay with him? So in a nice bit of symmetry, each of them has to confront a moral decision for which there is no completely convincing answer.The ultimate message, if there is one, seems to be that if you don't get the life you planned, then live the life you get. That's not too bad.What helps is that the actors do a good job of selling it. Chris Pratt is versatile and likable, and the equally versatile Jennifer Lawrence is excellent; she's got a rare screen presence. She is also not simply playing a 'victim' -- in other words, she has agency of her own. The supporting players (all two of them!) do fine as well, but it's the central pair that counts above all -- and, of course, the ship itself."
" Boring
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,1,Possibly the most boring film ever created.Even the full forward button couldn't eleviate the epic torpor inducing sleep fest.
" A hard to chew low punch about loneliness
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,7,"If anything, this flick gives a very specific view of the human psychology. The fact that people have a hard time spending time alone, and that it is historically inappropriate to wanting to be alone, it is a message to draw from this. The capturing of the human stages of loneliness pain is flawless, and regardless whether you watch The Passenger as a psychology-class or a moral lesson, if you watch this and don't end up pondering about something hard to chew about the human psychology and loneliness, you are probably watching with half your brain. Go watch it again."
" Yay! Finally found a great movie on Netflix!
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,9,I would've made the same choice as Jen. Who could leave a man as amazing as Chris Pratt?
" Passengers: A movie with great special effects, but no story
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,3,"When I saw ""Passengers"" for a lark, two things occurred to me. The special effects inside and outside of the spaceship look amazing, such as the interiors of the shape-ship, the internal machinery, the robots equipped with artificial intelligence, and the breathtaking pictures of space. The film also has two good-looking and likeable actors: Chris Pratt as Jim Prentice and Jennifer Lawrence as Aurora. It even has Laurence Fishburne to bring some gravitas and show up just in time to explain what is wrong with the spaceship.As the film developed, however, I kept asking myself, ""Where is the story?"" $150 million was spent to create a whole new world and pay the salaries of some highly talented actors. Yet more than an hour into the movie, I developed this sinking feeling that there was not going to be any story beyond the dull plot formula used in rom-com movies. The formula (for those unfamiliar with romantic comedies) is boy meets girl, boy develops a hot and heavy romance with girl, boy almost loses girl over a secret, and boy gets back with girl by doing something heroic. That's basically the plot of this movie dressed up with some colourful special effects.The frustrating thing about ""Passengers"" is that film director Morten Tyldum and screenwriter Jon Spaihts did not try to make a film that could been superior to a run-of-the-mill rom com formula. They had the resources to make a great film: $100+ million. They also had great actors: Academy-awarding winner Jennifer Lawrence, Laurence Fishburne (who delivered a brilliant performance in Boyz n' the Hood), and Chris Pratt. Yet this winning combination did not produce a winning movie, because no effort was made the develop a good screenplay to make the most of these actors' talents and the great special effects."
" 1million stars...uff...my all time favorite
",2018-12-30 00:00:00,10,Never get bored of this movie... always love to watch this again and again and again and again and again and again and again....both are just awesome... always expecting see both in some other movies but every time gets dissapointed....hope soon i ll hear about passengers 2...wow
" very average and mediocre
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,6,"Passengers had a lot of potential, but sadly it failed to live up to it. Its a movie that is almost the sheer definition of ""average"". It tried to juggle multiple genres at once, such as a horribly done love story and an action movie finale, and it doesn't do any of them well. You wont have a terrible time watching this, but its definitely the definition of an average - or even below average - sci-fi movie."
" Evokes a sense of real fear, not manufactured horror
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,7,"Maybe it's because this movie was talked down so much, but I enjoyed Passengers. The original premise evokes a sense of real fear, not manufactured horror, and the two likeable actors make for a likeable pair of characters. And even though the third act isn't as strong as the rest of the story, this is a science fiction film worth watching."
" Reassuringly clever and warm
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,9,You know the ending but you don't know how you are going to get there. And this is why the movie a pleasure to watch. The cast is small but perfect. If you enjoy a great cast and a clever story you won't be disappointed. There is genuine chemistry in this movie.
" Borderline INFP/ISFP's review
",2018-12-25 00:00:00,9,"I really liked this movie. I'm surprised by the very negative reviews. If you like sci-fi, give it a chance at least."
" alternative end
",2018-12-25 00:00:00,6,"As far as I can see no one need to die. Way is simple - just take few days from hibernated passangers. For a 90-year survival, each passenger would sacrifice 7 days. Exchange with passenger #1. This would be changed after 7 days with number 2 etc (2 with 3 ...).
Math: 4999*7/365 = 96 years
*this comment has been added for fun"
" Passable but with bad science
",2018-12-23 00:00:00,5,"This movie is enjoyable enough if you ignore the massive plot holes and bad science.On that note, it's disappointing that many commentators and reviewers (and the ""goofs"" section) can't get their science right either!50% light speed does NOT produce massive time dilation effects. A 120 year journey time on the ship would be 139 years on Earth (and that's assuming 50% LS for the entire trip and ignores the acceleration and deceleration at the start and end which would lower the Earth duration further to about 125 years). You can calculate this yourself - there are plenty of on-line calculators for time dilation effects.A sling-shot maneuver would not work to any great extent for 50% c.. One assumes this would be for a course correction, but why bother? You can just go straight to the destination which would be a shorter and quicker path. If it's for energy transfer (a la Voyager/Pioneer spacecraft) then that too would be minute and pointless.However, these are minor quibbles because so much other science is wrong in this movie. If you are prepared to ignore basic high-school science then the movie is enjoyable enough."
" Amazing Throughout
",2018-12-23 00:00:00,9,"One of the best movies ever made with a superb twist. Real empathy throughout.
The picturesque effects are utterly stunning, I've never seen anything this special in any movie for it's realistic effects.
Powerful realistic emotion soars through this movie."
" Heard much bad stuff, was positively surprised
",2018-12-23 00:00:00,7,"With so much negativ press I really thought this was going to be a bad movie. In the end I really enjoyed it! Its a nice tidbit for small scifi-fans, but probably not for avid trekkies.A bit of romance, a bit of drama and a bit of suspense with a good cast and even a good performance by Lawrence (whom I disliked in Hunger Games)."
" Passengers(2016)-Movie review
",2018-12-22 00:00:00,6,"Passengers is the story of Starship Avalon, who´s making a 120 year voyage to the Homestead Colony.One of the passengers happens to wake up 90 years early, the movie follows his life, and the life of another passenger during that period.
Passengers is a romantic sci-fi feature that has an interesting premisse for a story, however it is weighted down by a poorly written and developed script, the movie never manages to be as interesting as it could be.
Visually however the movie is great, the visual effects, the cinematography, and the production design really help to give the movie a reallistic feel.
The cast is good, Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt have a chemistry that works, there are good moments to be found with these two.
The movie has also some problems with the genre, it is a times a romance, a sci-fi, a comedy, and a thriller too, but it ends up just being a mess.
Passengers has an original premisse for a movie, a good cast, and it is beautfiull to look, however it is also poorly written, developed, directed and suffers from an inconsistent tone.Wasted potential unfortunately.6.4/10"
" If ya love space travel......and hot people
",2018-12-19 00:00:00,4,"You really have to put yourself in Chris and Jen's unrealistic shoes for this one. I can get behind travelling to another planet, state of the art space craft - but the mix between gravity, avatar, the martian, is all to much. I wish we could have dived alittle deeper into Mr.Pratt's reason for being on the ship, it seemed quickly passed over. The effects are alright, as good as they can get in space, but Jen's wardrobe is on point. Nice ending, leaves you to imagine thier life on the ship together, but all in all not the greatest - If youre looking for a cool space thriller - this is not the one - this is a love story between two very different poeple ( but that's never been done before right ;))"
" Loved it!
",2018-12-18 00:00:00,8,"I don't know what the critics are talking about because I loved it! It had romance, it had drama, it had action. What else does one need for Saturday night entertainment?"
" J-Law and Chris Pratt deserved better
",2018-12-18 00:00:00,5,"Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt's performances were great. As were the effects and graphics. But besides those, this wasn't the best idea for a movie. I found the story boring and predictable and there were parts where something different should have happened. So overall, a love story starring Pratt and J-Law is a good idea, but this wasn't the right movie for it."
" Different
",2018-12-15 00:00:00,9,Well done. Leaves you imagining..Well done. Leaves you imagining..Well done. Leaves you imagining..Well done. Leaves you imagining..
" Exciting, suspenseful sci-fi adventure
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,8,"I found this movie extremely enjoyable and will be sure to watch it again. The best part is the ship, a fascinating design, inside and out, that is a character in itself. I love seeing its whirling flight through space.
The plot is gripping and suspenseful. Special effects are excellent: such as what happens to the swimming pool when gravity fails and all the water becomes airborne.
The actors do a great job and are clearly enjoying themselves. Although the ending wasn't what I would have chosen, it was satisfactory."
" Your life is empty, it's probably why you critique movies professionally...
",2018-12-12 00:00:00,9,"Don't listen to professional movie critics. About anything. Ever. Go and see the movie for yourself and make your own decision. In this age of information that we're in, the truth is going to get out eventually. The days where professional movie critics (most likely paid shills) can make or break a film are over.Such is the case with Passengers. This is a very cool story. It's got everything you could ask for in a movie: action, romance, thrills, mystery, excitement and it grabs you by the spacesuit tether, shakes you up and makes you ask yourself, ""What would I do?""Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence portray two characters that you really care about. I was immediately drawn to their plight and ended up rooting for them the whole time.Do yourself a favor: rent, buy or borrow a copy of this movie and watch it.You'll be glad you did."
" The 10/10 reviews for this make me worried about the human race
",2018-12-07 00:00:00,5,"This is your quintessential ""the only reason the critics panned this is because they're pretentious; if you're braindead like me, you'll love it!"" movie.The film's compelling premise gave it the potential to be genuinely interesting but it failed to make anything close to an interesting use of it. Instead, it consistently took the most bland and uninspired approach at every turn.It's true that critics are often out of touch with mainstream audiences but frankly the glowing reviews you can see here show why that's not such a bad thing. I can only assume the people who think this movie is perfect a) received a head injury shortly before entering the cinema or b) have no concept of what makes a movie ""good"" beyond being mindlessly entertaining, and this film doesn't even have that going for itself."
" Very impressive
",2018-12-07 00:00:00,8,"What do you do when you have a few hours to spare and flop into an armchair? Yeah, watch a film - oh, let's try this one. Never heard of it, let's give it a go.
Sheesh, what a lovely film.
Not really a fan of sci-fi, only vaguely heard of the actors - except the brilliant Michael Sheen - I wasn't expecting much, but this film crawled slowly into my soul. The appalling dilemmas, the loneliness, the fight for survival and, of course, the love story. This is everything that terrible term 'chicflic' isn't and yet that's what it becomes; finishing with the philosophical conundrum - do we yearn for the future or live for the present?
The acting by the tiny cast is exemplary; understated and underplayed, the script is sparse and wonderful and, of course, the special effects are brilliant - never overwhelming the story. It's a film that would make a great stage play despite having galaxies as your backdrop, an intimate drama about people, their wishes and desires.
Highly recommended."
" Like a dubstep version of Clair de Lune
",2018-12-07 00:00:00,7,"Passengers needs to be commended on some beautiful imagery and transcendent music by the ever-classy Thomas Newman (which actually makes the film a bit too whimsical in places where a deeper dramatic reading should occur). But the main problem is the movie feels like a Hollywood exec note-fest ""move this part along faster,"" or ""don't get too deep here"" (a problem particularly noticeable in the film's second and third acts). Passengers could have been a first-rate film like Titanic but is stuck languishing in ""decent Hollywood adventure/romance"" almost entirely because of pacing problems. Because of that, I give it an even 7/10: it's worth a watch and is fun, but I wish it pushed just a little harder and gave us a classic."
" Superior sci-fi
",2018-12-06 00:00:00,9,"The star-ship Avalon has a crew of two hundred and fifty eight along with five thousand passengers; all of them asleep. They are thirty years into a hundred and twenty year journey to the colony world; Homestead II. Then something goes wrong; a meteor strikes the ship leading to a malfunction in one of the sleeping pods; passenger Jim Preston is awakened and finds himself on an empty ship. At first he thinks the journey is almost over then he learns the terrible truth; he will die of old age long before the Avalon reaches its destination. Inevitably the loneliness gets to him and he starts contemplating waking another passenger; eventually he wakes Aurora Lane but doesn't tell her that that he is responsible for putting her in that position. He is concerned what might happen if she were to find out; that isn't the only thing to worry about though.I really enjoyed this sci-fi drama; it started well as it introduced us to Jim and his situation. This wasn't rushed so the viewer can feel his growing desperation and be more sympathetic when he makes the morally questionably choice of waking Aurora. Similarly their growing relationship isn't too rushed. Towards the end the tension rises as it is far from clear if both of our protagonists will survive the growing technical threat. These two lead characters are believable and well-acted by Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence. I also enjoyed Michael Sheen's performance as the ship's android barman, a delightful nod to the bar in 'The Shining'. The ship's design is impressive and the special effects are superlative. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of character led science fiction without aliens or antagonists."
" Left me feeling confused
",2018-12-05 00:00:00,5,"-Fist, Jennifer Lawrence's performance was awe-inspiring for a script and a partner she had. One could feel empathy for her even in the very odd movie twists.
Graphics were beautiful, the rest...Here is what I would have loved seeing:
Bar and barmen are definitely referencing ""The Shining"", would be awesome if that was a ghost ship with some horror/mystery actions.The plot going from a love story to her going insane and him going full stocker like in the ""Gone Girl"" would be excellent too.What really happened. Super weird guy wakes up a hot girl... They fall in love; they have a fight, they solve a problem, they live together, the end.Things that bothered me personally the most:
Where did the birds, in the end, come from?Didn't they use all of the 5300 people's food in the 88 years on the ship?No children?Only one medical tube?No function of automatic crew alert when the ship goes boom?The ship can fly next to a red giant but can't withhold asteroids?You don't melt down when you are fired with a nuclear well, fire?Obviously, no way to go back to sleep?The guy spends a year on the ship and doesn't wake up other engineers?An engineer doesn't realize that the ship is malfunctioning for two years even though it glitches all the time?Why is a journalist richer than an engineer?Why can't you swim out of water without gravity? There are still dense particles around you.So many questions... Confused me..."
" Solid Sci-Fi - Passengers
",2018-12-05 00:00:00,7,"Buckle up, its going to be a bumpy ride. The three lead actors make this a very entertaining film, and one could even say the bartender steals the film. The film is well-directed, and the production values are impressive. The story about a colony going off into space on a trip that takes over 100 years is interesting, and even more interesting is when a malfunction causes one of the passengers to awake just a bit prematurely; about 90 years prematurely. After a year of agonizing, the passenger decides to wake a beautiful woman to keep him company; in essence, robbing her of her life on the future planet. I will not reveal the results of this desperate attempt to relieve loneliness. Suffice it to say there are complications. Great special effects and a solid story; can't ask for much more in sci-fi."
" Chemistry, chemistry and suspense.
",2018-12-05 00:00:00,10,"Here we have two persons (Lawrence and Pratt) who generally are easy going and take things lightheartedly. I was concerned that this would overshadow the movies storyline, but found their personalities complimented each other to perfection. Their chemistry together can be seen within their first few scenes.The connection that you feel between the two connects you to the movie and progresses the story-line in a meaningful way.I thoroughly enjoyed minute 1 to minute 118.Highly recommended."
" Space Titanic
",2018-12-05 00:00:00,9,"It is something like the movie titanic but in space. Great visual effects. Not boring. I found two major flaws in the story:
1. When she saved him. Missing part is the logic how is she going to transport him to sickbay
2. Ending."
" I really enjoyed it
",2018-12-04 00:00:00,9,"I had no idea what I was about to watch if I'm honest, but the film really hooked me. There is some level of predictability but to be honest at the time while I was watching I wasn't sure what was going to happen.
The concept is a really fascinating one, really thought-provoking, and the acting is great, you do genuinely becoming involved with the characters.
There's a great period of tension, I won't give specifics in case you've yet to watch it, and it even gets relieved in a self-consistent (with the film) and interesting way.
Overall I rate based on enjoyment and I loved it."
" Very original, beautifully made.
",2018-12-02 00:00:00,9,"Passengers is a truly brilliant movie, it's hard to place it into a genre, but it is very much a sci fi love story. The concept is a great one, and it poses a fabulous question, could you force someone to spend their life with you, or live a solitary life. The idea is very original and very clever, the special effects are breathtaking, and the cinematography is first class. The main trio of actors do a superb job, but it's the dazzling Jennifer Lawrence that stood out for me.Attention to the detail to this film was first rate, huge credit to all those behind the scenes.It's not often the case that I wish a film wouldn't end, but after fifteen minutes or so, I was captivated, and really didn't want it to end.Fabulous film, 9/10"
" Should've let her sleep.
",2018-12-02 00:00:00,6,"Excellent visual realisation and use of scale but very poor acting. Why does Jennifer Lawrence play a dizzy blond who needs rescuing? Why is Chris Prat playing Chris Prat?
A desperately unoriginal corporate attempt at getting couples to watch SF."
" One of my favourite ever films
",2018-12-02 00:00:00,10,This film was so heart warming. It made me cry so many times. Chris Pratt and Jeniffer Lawrence were so adorable. I just loved this film so much. 10/10
" What a great movie...
",2018-11-29 00:00:00,9,"What can i say, such a good plot and acting. Very interesting movie. I would give this a watch for sure, a very emotional and lovely movie, which you can see by yourself, with your family or girlfriend. <3"
" Problematic
",2018-11-27 00:00:00,4,"PASSENGERS is an oddball, problematic wannabe sci-fi epic that fails to convince on many levels. Chris Pratt once against plays a slightly smug, unlikeable protagonist (similar to his one in JURASSIC WORLD) who finds himself alone on a huge spaceship in the middle of nowhere for the next 90 years. Problems arise when he decides to wake up a fellow passenger, as played by Jennifer Lawrence. The issue is that he essentially signs her death sentence by doing so. So you have a film where a guy in essence murders a woman, who proceeds to fall in love with him. Please! It's as cheesy as it sounds, and some half-hearted outer-space peril feels like leftovers from GRAVITY rather than anything interesting. The best thing in the film is Laurence Fishburne and he has way too little screen time to make this any good."
" Heart melts
",2018-11-27 00:00:00,10,"After seeing this movie,you will become a fan of Jennifer Lawrence.. because I became.."
" Enjoyable
",2018-11-25 00:00:00,5,A somewhat silly sci fi movie . It's Enjoyable and does have a few edge of the seat moments 5/10
" Future of Rayn Airlines where bad services there for you.
",2018-11-24 00:00:00,7,Could had shown what happened to them in the end. Like who died first and is one of them sleeping?
" An impressively constructed celebration of toxic masculinity
",2018-11-24 00:00:00,2,"The trailer for this sci-fi love story put our male character (Chris Pratt) and our female character (Jennifer Lawrence) on an equal footing, as does the poster - in fact, Lawrence is ABOVE Pratt in the poster. However, any fears of this being some kind of feminist propaganda are soon alleviated by the fact that the story is mainly through the eyes of our hero - the man!We see him wake up from his hibernation pod 90 years too early, while 5000 other travellers remain sleeping. The poor chap tries to make the best of it, but understandably begins to get a bit sad and maybe even a little loopy. After about a year of loneliness (perhaps about 25 minutes into the film) he decides to wake up one of the sleeping hotties, after falling madly in love with her due to her aforementioned hotness and maybe a bit because of whatever personality he could ascertain from watching videos of her on the ship computers records.Now, some of you more sensitive types may think that this was somewhat naughty of him, to condemn a young woman to a life aboard the ship with only him (and, admittedly, a very charming Michael Sheen android) as company. And, I have to admit that one of the films few faults is that Pratt agonises over this decision for far too long - why wouldn't she want to spend her life with you and you alone?? You're a man and she is a woman; of course she'll do what you decide, you're a goddamn hero, man. It's as if consent is important or something - political correctness gone mad!!And - obviously! - she falls in love with him. Sure, she doesn't know the circumstances of her waking up, but the merits of keeping that a secret were perfectly well proven when (about an hour in), she finds out and gets all hysterical. Like, proper crazy and angry. You love him, don't you? What does it matter that he chose the life you were going to have to lead until your death and cornered you into loving him? It's about the destination, not the journey sweetheart.I saw one libtard reviewer saying that the film should have been from her POV; from when she woke up so that the audience are in the dark about him waking her, too, therefore making the twist of her finding out an unsettling and creepy reveal. But that would have been dumb, because that would have made the guy look really bad and the woman look like some kind of victim. And as if obsessive and deceitful behaviour in trying to get a woman to sleep with you is unacceptable. Plus, when they have to work together in the final third of the film, to save the ship and other passengers, it would have created a weird tension about whether the guy was actually good or not. And who wants that kind of ambiguity and social commentary in a film? Yawn. Leave that to the Frenchies.It is just such a beautiful love story as it is. Our male protagonist proves time and time again that he is the intelligent one and can save the day. This proves to her that he is a real man and a provider, who can give her security. He can FIX things but also has a sensitive side. A clever way of showing this in the film, is when he plants a tree on the ship. Lovely. What normal woman wouldn't fall madly in love with him? I also liked that she had the chance to hibernate again but she chooses a life with him because he is so great. Plus, this then makes the whole thing her idea, completely absolving the man of any guilt so, social justice warriors, there's that apparent moral conundrum solved.If you want to see an original sci-fi with a strong male lead and super-hot female love interest, along with some astounding visuals and action scenes, then look no further!!!"
" Enjoyable but a bit dodgy
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,7,"It's very well animated sci-fi and pretty to look at. The spaceship setting feels well thought through. The main story arch is quite predictable but that didn't really bother me because the acting was enjoyable.But then you think a little bit about the story and how you empathised with the male protagonist's actions, and you come to the realisation that it wouldn't need to be changed a lot to be equivalent to the rapists's wet dream of his victim getting turned on by being raped.And then you feel a bit gross."
" Beautiful and so human
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,10,"This film explores every aspect of humanity with a breathtaking sci-fi setting. Love, loneliness, betrayal, desperation, awe, aspiration, creativity, forgiveness, discovery, compassion and hope.
Beautifully written, superbly acted, and captivating to watch"
" Excellent!
",2018-11-22 00:00:00,10,"It's quite rare these days to see a beautifully shot, non shakycam movie. Good storyline and superb acting, very well done!"
" A top notch ""will watch it many times"" kind of movie
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,10,"Why the heck haven't I watched this before!?. Let me just start by saying it's so damn beautiful and satisfying to the eye with all its state of the art CGI and visual effects. Secondly, since only three or four characters were presented throughout the whole movie we as viewers had the fulfilling opportunity to care deeply for each and everyone.. Now I reach the good stuff; It's one of the greatest/purest Love stories I've ever witnessed in a movie. At the beginning the main character ""Jim Preston"" arguably commits an unspeakable act, a really bad thing which concerns the other main character ""Aurora Lane"", however he's only human. And as the story progresses it turns out that what he did brought two passionate hearts together only to join and form an unmatched power. His outrageous decision revived her soul and gave her the best version of a life which she never remotely expected, a life that only existed in her wildest dreams, A one Hell of a Life !"
" The stars are for the visuals. I respect all four actors, but the story is pathetic and even more so if this is how real people deal with being totally alone!
",2018-11-18 00:00:00,7,"Everyone else has said what they think of this movie, but none of the dozens of reviews I've read mention just how the idea of being perfectly healthy with nearly anything and everything you could wish more at your disposal (no idea there is a major problem with the ship yet) causes a man or had it been a woman to be in such despair the person wants to commit suicide all because he/she would have to love a life totally alone as the ship travels through the wonderess vastness of space. I can understand looking at peoples video files. I can understand being lonely as I've been thrust into a life of utter aloneness since 2013. It's now almost 2019 and although I speak to no one, go fishing in my backyard almost daily, have no one to assist me with my pain. No one to cuddle up with. No one to even speak to, etc. I've been suffering several major health issues and NO ONE IS HELPING ME OR DO I HAVE ALL I COULD EVER WANT FOR FREE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. And my view outside is no where near as incredible as seen by just looking out a window in this movie.What I find most hard to believe is anyone so weak willed, so lacking in personal fortitude, that they seriously think about suicide when they're in perfect health with all the food, water, entertainment they could want except the contact with another human being. The movie also proved... had these people met in a real life setting, she would have never given him a second thought because she is rich. Plus, let's add to my list of pathetic things...his total selfishness in deciding to condemn another person to his fate just so he won't be alone. How about this Hollywood... What would have made a REAL good story in this setting is as follows....She gets so pissed at his actions, she kills him and SHE lives out the rest of her life alone or until the ship blows up or gets to be put into the medical stasis pod?. And just one more thought. Most shows/movies when a man and woman have sex, they never use protection or contraception and nearly always the woman gets pregnant. So why didn't these two lovers have a child or three to leave behind to finish the voyage to the new planet in their place and leave a legacy of their existence behind?"
" Great movie to know life.
",2018-11-13 00:00:00,10,Great movie to know the importance of life. It tells you that without relationship no technology can bring pleasure for you entire life.
" 👍
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,9,It was far better than i expected after seeing the reviews and ratings . Nice story and a good one to watch
" Though provoking movie with a Sci-Fi backdrop
",2018-11-10 00:00:00,8,"This movie was beautiful in every way, the concept of the story is recognizable but as one can recall, never been seen before in any Hollywood production. So its unique of its kind. Although its marketed as a sci-fi movie, and for the most part it is very well sci-fi indeed, but the sci-fi is not the important part at all. Actually its a thriller with a romantic touch, but all by all its a definite psychological movie. It explores the utmost human despair and emotions that comes with space travel of such vast magnitude that expands generations. The movie stimulates you to ask oneself, what would I do If I was put in the same situation, you'll probably be surprised that your answer wont differ much from the movie. All in all a pretty decent film, and superb performance from Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Patt. They both kept you engaged with the story during the whole movie, a difficult task for which they executed splendidly."
" Drama! override. romance! Reside.
",2018-11-10 00:00:00,9,"This is a marvelous sci-fi movie I noticed the character's names sound little fishy Mr. Preston and miss lane could've been Jim Boyed and Laura Shawn or something similar , Jennifer acting was outstanding ,but not as Chris's because on the last scene she seemed to overact the thrilling scenes, however ,she's the best at voiceovers scenes , synopsis of the movies loneliness is torturous can make you go crazy and make you harm others cause nobody want to ache alone and the second learned is not to dwell on things you can't control , instead focus on what you can control and use it to make you happy .
the main moral of the story is not to dismiss love and accept the fact that fate is the captain of your life not the other way around ."
" Stupid Engineering
",2018-11-04 00:00:00,6,The designers of this spacecraft were complete idiots. Sure put the crew in stasis but why not have an android maintenance crew? The only android aboard is the bartender?!
" Great if you like these kind of stories
",2018-11-02 00:00:00,9,"I can imagine why there are such diverse reviews regarding this movie. I loved it, but then, I love movies that reach for the stars and are romantic on top, with extremely good CGI.
The story is also fresh and new and quite well developed. Jennifer Lawrence is an excellent actress. The scenes in which she is distressed are extremely convincing.
There is a lot of comment about the scientific errors in this movie and yes, there are quite a few things that could be commented on. None of the errors bother me, even the sudden stop of gravity. The gyroscopic effect of the rotating starship makes a sudden stop of gravity a bit unconvincing, but alas. The effects generated with the absence of gravity in the swimming pool are stunningly good.
So if you like a movie in which one is truly lost in space, have a go at Passengers."
" Great Movie! Don't Understand Negative Reviews
",2018-10-28 00:00:00,8,"I will preface this review by stating I'm going to speak in generalities because I don't want to spoil it by giving details.This is a great movie it has the right mix of sci-fi, mystery, romance, a really shocking plot twist with a great ending. I don't understand why people have called this movie horrible because it's really an awesome movie. The first 2/3 of the movie spends he necessary time building the plot and drawing you in as a viewer. But the last 1/3 of the movie feels rushed. I really would have rather had a large beer movie and wish they had spent more time on resolving the issue. If they had done Leo's I could've given this movie a 10. I love movies that are based around character development and this one does a great job. I found this movie totally entertaining and it took me through a full range of almost every emotions and made me feel what ""The Passengers' did. Don't pay any attention to the PAC police he thought this movie was just horrible and scandalous because it's not it's a great movie for people of all ages."
" Brilliant
",2018-10-25 00:00:00,10,"Ok, so when I first saw this movie it wasn't what I expected. But I loved it anyway!
I'm not going to get into debates about the morally right or wrong decisions made by characters in the story. I'm just going to say that it is a good, complicated and compelling story that I find myself watching again ... Frequently.
I recommend it."
" Really good but not revolutionary.
",2018-10-24 00:00:00,8,The Movie is well written and the music is awesome. There are some not so fitting expressions here and there and some cuts that weren't needed but it was a really good experience to watch.
" Mind-blowing
",2018-10-22 00:00:00,8,"This is a awesome Movie In sci-fi Feed. ship Design, technology, mostly Arthur ( The Android Robo) Very Impressive."
" What a SURPRISE! VERY good movie
",2018-10-19 00:00:00,10,"I am stuck in the past. I love movies from the 'Golden Age' - ~1940-1960. Most 'modern' movies are blood, gore, sex, and wild swings in the sound, requiring fast fingers on the volume button. I have gotten to the point I seldom watch recently filmed movies.
HOWEVER, this was an outstanding movie. The plot was plausible, the acting the best I have seen in many years. Difficult scenes were handled with ease and skill, and I was absolutely absorbed in the story.
Couldn't wait to show it to my wife, who was equally impressed!"
" Not all bad
",2018-10-18 00:00:00,5,"While I was watcing this I kept thinking how easy it would have been to change few minor things in the script and this would have worked as a perfect prologue for Pandorum.As this is, I can't really recommend this one to anybody. Too little sci-fi, too little romance, too much boring and illogical nonsense."
" Not exactly what I was expecting...
",2018-10-17 00:00:00,8,"I went into this movie thinking there were going to be other life forms involved; some sort of aliens. It ended up being a character piece. There were some scenes at the end that were ridiculous and implausible, but I just overlooked those and tried to enjoy the story. I also really liked the ending. It was a happy/sad ending, depending on how you looked at it. All in all, I'm glad I added it to my home collection."
" What would you do?
",2018-10-15 00:00:00,8,"What would you do if you wore alone for the next 90 years. That question, that concept makes this film stronger as some of the critics makes you believe. I found it very enjoyable, a real feel good film. 8/10"
" Loved this movie
",2018-10-12 00:00:00,9,"Jeniffer Lawrence and Chris Pratt are brilliant in this movie. I really liked them both beforehand, but together they are definitely also worth watching."
" Better than expected and not a Sci-Fi film
",2018-10-10 00:00:00,8,"Going into this movie I had fairly low expectations given its reviews / score, and overall I was pleasantly surprised.Although it is actually visually entertaining in a lot of scenes, I would not say Passengers is a Sci Fi movie at all - it is a movie which happens to be staged in space (under a not so farfetched premise I might add) about a moral dilemma the characters face and that allows you to opine on their actions throughout.Their emotions and challenges did come across well to me as viewer, and if anything the action scenes (although fine) make it more a standard proposition than it otherwise would be, should it rest solely on the characters experience.Pratt and Lawrence are not overwhelmingly good, but do not disappoint either.Plot has some holes / questions it progresses, but overall the narrative is very well delivered and remains thought provoking through most of the movie."
" Great, original SciFi!
",2018-10-08 00:00:00,10,"I love good SiFi but it's seldom original. Far too many are just cgi orgies. This one however hits every mark. It's believable, you care about the characters, and it's cgi is there for a purpose. Without a great story a movie is pointless and this one has it. The crushing despair and hopeless of a man living alone in a high-tech tomb stayed with me for days. His actions are at once understable and unforgivable. There is redemption through heroism of course but the premise of living entrapment is hard to forget. Both Pratt and Lawrence are great. They created a loving couple that you want to know more about at the end but you will have to fill in the blanks from what you are given. It's not a movie that will spawn endless sequels. It's simply a singular powerful story that you won't soon forget."
" MOOOOST PREDIIIIICTABLE FILM EEEEEVER
",2018-10-07 00:00:00,1,"Now that this film was available on netflix we decided to watch.. my girlfriend predicted the whole film from 20 minutes into the film (accurately)... it was heroically dissappointing. 
Respect to the graphic design, but the storyline just sucked."
" Totally cliche
",2018-10-05 00:00:00,2,Oh boy... just another simple story line based around perfect good looking actors... with a somewhat happy ending...Great computer animation. We don't need the great actors any longer. Sad as it is. The Matrix has you.
" Why the bad ratings????
",2018-10-04 00:00:00,9,I loved it. It was beautiful and eerie. I found the characters to have depth and the plot fascinating. The scenery was really lovely and the end was hauntingly romantice. Great chemistry.
" Lajwaab!! Zabardast!! Zindabad!!
",2018-10-02 00:00:00,10,"When Aurora was out there to save Jim in climax of this beautiful sci-fi and the string attached to Aurora fell short just when she was about to catch Jim, I thought it is another hollywood flick with as usual sad endings as we Indians always appreciate a happy one, Morten Tyldum save my day when a string to Jim come handy to Aurora and saved my day and climax to the movie which I felt is most powerful scene of the movie, it felt like she saved me instead."
" Solid Execution on a Trite Storyline
",2018-10-01 00:00:00,5,"There is a lot of positive in this movie, but unfortunately, it fails to deliver overall.There are few cast members with any screen time. Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt have to deliver and they do. The acting is solid. The special effects and cinematography are also well-done.For a movie to be good, a lot as to fall in place. In this case, the plot fails to deliver. I've seen a LOT of movies, and there was nothing original here. The story arc is exactly what we would expect. As a lifelong technician, there were some eye-rolling moments on the technical aspects of the storytelling as well.It's not a bad movie, but it is uninspired. With so much to chose from, I should have chosen another way to spend my time."
" No Science in the Sci-Fi
",2018-09-30 00:00:00,6,"I pretty much agree with the 5/10 review by Stefan Morcov. A romance, love/hate story aboard a spaceship headed for a distant galaxy and planet. The first half of movie moved much too slow, remaking the Robinson Crusoe role. Even after he awakens Aurora, watching them dine and dance, etc. took much too long. The trailers and official studio promos say that the 2 sleep pods malfunction. The one surprise is that the ""hero"" disables the girl's pod for his own ""companionship"" needs. I don't blame her for beating the c**p out of him when she finds out! Being the mechanical engineer that he is, he swings a great sledgehammer to fix things. Agree with the alternative solutions which Stefan offers. Once the Officer's pod malfunctioned and he awoke, they had full access to controls of the ship. An awakening of key crew member(s) would have been extremely important at that point. Also agree that 5200+ passengers and crew needed more than 1 autodoc bed. Therefore could have put those awake back to sleep after crisis over. A miracle that Jim survived the plasma blast while in space and didn't die of radiation poisoning.Beautiful visuals and CGI. All in all, glad I didn't pay big bucks to see this in theatre, but watched on DVD from library. Only gave 6 instead of Stefan's 5 because of the special effects, visuals and CGI."
" Actual RATINGS
",2018-09-29 00:00:00,7,"7.5
The ending was the worst thing in the movie 
The cinematography was great
The design of the spaceship was very beautiful 
The no gravity swimming pool scene was the best thing in the movie
The actors were good not great this movie will not be mentioned in there career as memorable characters thay made
The soundtrack is from that kind which you may like it or not so it depends on which kind of music you like
The story is good at the beginning but when it comes to the ending it ends in a silly way"
" Excellent
",2018-09-27 00:00:00,8,It's extraordinary movie with mind blowing technology and fantastic storyline with top class artists and Jennifer looks gorgeous.... Must watch movie.
" 88 years is too long for two people.
",2018-09-27 00:00:00,8,"Passengers, two great players to meet for the first time in a project together, I think.I like a lot of space movies these days.actually the film proceeded a little heavy but this is very normal.Because most of the time there is not much action Two people can wait on a big ship how much action can wait but sometimes I get bored.I did not understand the actions on the last scenes I could not fully understand the difficulty on the ship and a person can wear such a heat even if the outer space dress did not make sense to me the last scenes I found absurd but overall I liked it was good.
I already like the movies about the passage of this time. I would recommend this to anyone who wanted to get as badly as the films of the genre wanted, finally the movie was nice."
" Pleasant Surprise
",2018-09-26 00:00:00,9,I really enjoyed this movie. Seeing Mr Pratt get a role with more character depth was refreshing. Ms. Lawrence was on point. The story had some jaw dropping twists. A great job.
" Day after day...
",2018-09-25 00:00:00,8,"Not a bad and interesting story, adequate graphics, but what for me personally was the most enjoyable in this film, so it's to observe the design of everyday life. I really liked how different interfaces work, service robots and other stuff."
" Highly entertaining and thrilling ride - forget the critics
",2018-09-25 00:00:00,9,"Guys
Whatever negative reviews you are reading, are doing a great disservice to this timeless space adventure. When they say there is no plot, think back for moment. The narrative, the character exploration, psychological feeling of lonliness and the resultant action taken by mind, all seem perfectly possible when you watch Chris Pratt. Now comes Jennifer and her terrific acting, body language and dialogues. All make her character come live on screen and you almost feel part of it and who wouldn't want to be with her alone in a spaceship full of Luxury. And there's a twist in their relationship which is shown very convincingly. You can't blame the script so far and the visually stunning screenplay too.Then comes the bigger twist, the very reason one would think why Chris Pratt was woken up from hibernation in the first place. Even if you choose to believe it was not the central computer who did it intentionally to save the ship, but it was pure malfunction, it still makes sense since there are plenty of scenes in the movie to show that PODs can malfunction, which is shown with another surprise character - Lawrence as the captain.
And there is this usual climactic scenes when the real heroes save the ship. In fact, it was a real climax and not an anti-climax as many critiques wrote.So go ahead and enjoy this movie and let's make it a cult one (in Space Adventure category)"
" A great drama/sci fi movie!
",2018-09-22 00:00:00,9,"I expected a romantic drama that might as well have been going on in a high tech looking hotel or on a boat.
The level of sci was great! They had enough cool elements without taking it too far (which MANY movies do!)
No far fetched techno-babbel or things that need explaining because it's taken from some writer's dream on acid.
2 fantastic actors and a story most people will both recognize parts from, and FEEL because the setting and acting is good.
I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie and how much I was sucked in.See it now!
Minor spoiler (goof):
I only wish they could have showed Jim getting a reply from earth 55 years later. :)"
" Time-pass.
",2018-09-20 00:00:00,2,"Just imagination story, only a simple time pass movie."
" Pleasant and cool
",2018-09-19 00:00:00,9,"The movie is surprisingly cool and fantastic. Although Chris and Jennifer have done marvelous job, but the real spectacular throw of a show was Michael sheen.. i was taken away by his magnificent performance. As soon as he comes on screen, temperature of movie becomes cool and fascinating."
" Good movie
",2018-09-19 00:00:00,9,"The critics score on e.g. rottentomatoes is a shame. This is entertaining, well acted and with great visuals. One of those movies to watch more than once."
" What if
",2018-09-15 00:00:00,8,What if they used autopod to hibernate each other for alternate months. So that they will be in their 40s when it reach homstead 2
" Great looking CGI
",2018-08-31 00:00:00,8,Graphics are great and the story runs smoothly. Well done.
" absorbing, superb cast with great chemistry
",2018-08-25 00:00:00,10,"My husband caught this on TV while I was away on a trip and highly recommended it. He knows much better than the critics. I loved it! This film made me take Chris Pratt seriously as an actor. He handles the solitude scenes brilliantly as poignantly as Tom Hanks in ""Castaway"" or Richard Chamberlain as the wrongly imprisoned Edmond Dantes in ""The Count of Monte Cristo"". Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence have great chemistry. Calling the heroine ""Aurora"" like Sleeping Beauty was a nice touch. Lose yourself in the haunting music, story and special effects. Enjoy!"
" Chillout Militant Feminists
",2018-08-25 00:00:00,8,"Please watch this film, don't be tempted to avoid this really great film because some militant feminist says it is sexist, or depicting the a-typical male dominance over women. This is a beautiful film, Thomas Newman tantalises your ears, the special affects are appropriate and the story is morally compelling. If you were on a journey to another planet, you wake up with no way to go back to sleep again, you will be alone for the rest of your life, as there is still 80 years to go. What would you do?If this film was a women waking up a man, critics would be giving this a blinding review. However its not, so of course the hashtag all men are pigs applies. I don't for one second feel like the protagonist is waking up another passenger because he wants to sleep with her, its not stockholm syndrome, its not misogyny, its Just a good film, that captures the imagination and asks a completely innocent question, what would you do?Lovely, well acted film."
" Unrealistic, but enjoyable.
",2018-08-18 00:00:00,7,"There might be some spoilers in this review.Now, alot of people thinks that this movie or sci-fi movies ""should be realistic"". Sadly, those people were in for a disappointment. This movie has little realism, nor does it even try to be realistic. I mean the guy basicly takes a nuke straight in his face and survives by being revived by all methods of medical healthcare there is... at once.HOWEVER1. Sci-fi movies are never realistic. I have never in history seen a sci-fi movie that actually manages to follow laws of physic, nor even simple matters, because of the simple fact that it would get boring.2. The acting in this movie is okay, but what's real good is the feeling it gives you of being alone. The angst, the fear and how much social contact matters to us.3. Alot of people say ""he should've waken up a crew member from the beginning"". What these people don't get is that this guy has spent a year searching for a way to get back into hybernation. He has tried everything in his power to do so and has reached to the conclusion that nothing can be done. Now if someone had the choice of waking up 1 person under these conditions: why not choose someone you could see yourself spending the rest of your life with?So if you're okay with not everything being realistic, watch this movie.If not, don't watch sci-fi."
" A slower paced underrated pearl
",2018-08-17 00:00:00,9,"Sure, there is a few elements of Soap Opera (Space Opera) to it, with some typical Hollywood Love Drama and the hero that suddenly shows up, with vital information helping the two passengers to find the right track, but! It is masterful within its own parameters. It's not trying to be something it is not.I am a sucker for these types of movies. Interstellar travel on space ships. The set design and cinematography is beyond amazing. The imagery is wonderous. It's fascinating to look at and it has a moral question that resonates. I really wish more movies like this would come out. It's a slightly more relaxed version of Interstellar (without the horrendous ending that Interstellar had) and The Martian. Keep making movies like these!"
" Titanic in Space
",2018-08-16 00:00:00,5,"To begin with, the film seems quite interesting if you can forgive the 'nods' (nods?! More like gaping rip offs) to 2001: Space Odyssey and The Shining bar. It started off well and around the middle when Aurora learns of Jims secret, things seem to pick up and feel tense. But after this, it becomes something more that resembles Titanic in Space and the turns into a vomit inducing love story that leaves all shred of science and beliavility at the door. It started well, but by the end I was bored and didn't feel satisfied at all. Especially with everything that had happened prior to the 'Titanic' scenario, the ending just feels like a unicorns magic dust fart in the face of the audience.The cinematography is beautiful. The acting superb. But the story in itself, starts off promising and then just collapses into too many deux ex machina in too short a time, with an ending that just made me physically feel sick from how corny amd deflating it was."
" Children
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,6,I - surprisingly - enjoyed it. It would have been nice if they would have elaborated more on the other 87 years during the credits. Maybe have shown they had children who go on to live on the new planet. I mean they created such a wonderful environment - children would have been a bonus.
" Major plot hole.
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,4,"He is able to look up profiles on everyone on the ship, but doesn't decide to look for a pod mechanic that could of put them both back to sleep..."
" Boring
",2018-08-10 00:00:00,2,"Boring. Just boring. Nothing is happening for the most part of the movie. Interesting concept, they could've done so much with it"
" Sci-fi dreamland combination
",2018-08-06 00:00:00,9,"It's very nicely crafted with decent touch given with might be huge investment.I liked the most about many facilities available but it's still not enough as per my point of view, might be due to budgetary issue or due to shortening the time-span of the movie. Hope to watch sequel of the movie to be made with much more facilities with automation.If I would be making sequel of it, I would show how he manages to survive up to 90 years, thinking of him by going into hibernation mode then it's not very smooth so discarding this thought, I think of him leaving this spaceship, after movie showing all facilities which I've dreamed of, to find a loop outside in space or at some other planet, where with others' help reach to the future with some short of time-machine.In the threequel, I would describe how they both will meet after 120 years, still young, and how they play their part to make new planet, which is displayed at the end of the original movie, more beautiful or like a wonderland with all of their creative nature. In that planet, they won't need to do any work to survive; they would do things what they like the most without any burden of earning or any other restriction on resources available to them as I would show abundant resources available at their disposal.They'll have to make every effort just to have more & more of whatever they want, and be able achieve it at the end of the movie."
" Not usual romantic movie!
",2018-08-02 00:00:00,4,"It is a very enjoyable movie for its visuals, designs, and the reasonable plot to present it for audience as a not a usual but yet sweet romantic movie in an unusual setting.. If you look at it with expectation of believable reason why such a situation started and how it got continued then you will absolutely will get frustrated (there are few reasons presented in this movie for why the situation exist and continued). There are few ""adventures"" scenes with nice visuals that can make this romantic movie little exciting... it is a romantic movie where couples can enjoy. This movie presented an unusual situation, we set back and see what the characters do in that situation. There is no need to look at different ways to approach the situation and also no need to explore the reasons of such situation exist.. that is all."
" Stranded in Space
",2018-07-21 00:00:00,2,"I can't stand STRANDED movies! 1. They're extremely cheap. They only have to pay for one actor for most of the film. In this case the maximum reached were 3 actors until I fell asleep. 2. They're always far too long & usually extremely boring. 3. Even the actors appear bored at some point while the director tries hard to figure in which direction to go next to waste even more of your time. 
Find something better to do or watch than this rubbish."
" Nice special effects but storyline doesn't keep up
",2018-07-16 00:00:00,5,"The special effects were good but the storyline, while initally compelling, devolved into a contrived ""Lifetime""-style movie"
" Wonderful, suspenseful, and emotional all at the same time.
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,10,I truly did love this movie and I would recommended it to anybody. I think this is a movie everyone will fall in love with.
" I LOVED the first quarter of the movie
",2018-07-13 00:00:00,6,"I loved this movie up until the point that the Jennifer Lawrence character was awakened - which is a bit unexpected, as I usually find Lawrence attractive and talented. But as long as Chris Pratt was by himself, I found an hilarious comic sci-fi scenario - where he's trapped in an environment which couldn't be happening, because the software designers didn't anticipate it, and they know everything, right? I see myself dealing with this all the time."
" Great Movie
",2018-07-12 00:00:00,8,"This movie was better than I thought it would be. I thought it would be just another throw away sci fi film. But it was much more than that. The cast is small with only two main characters which are played by both Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt who both do phenomenal acting in this movie. With such a small cast this film very much relies on character development and we get a lot of that. If you are expecting a fast past survival sci fi space movie than look somewhere else because this is a ""slow"" movie which some people might not like but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Getting to learn more and more about the characters and what their reasons are for being on this ship in space was great. It slowly grows on you and so do these characters in what I call a dramatic sci fi romance story. The movie explores themes of fulfillment, and what exactly living happily where you are means. Over all great movie with great cinematography, acting, score, story, and character development."
" Very good. I would have been fine with it going even longer
",2018-07-07 00:00:00,7,"Even at two hours I felt it was just a little too rushed. I understand the caution with making it run too long but it felt like an extra half hour would have gone a long way to show the significant length of time the characters spent in such solitude. They did a good job of it but a few extra minutes could have been well spent to create the feeling of loneliness first of just Jim and then both Jim and Aurora. I did feel the chemistry between Chris Pratt as Jim and Jennifer Lawrence as Aurora was extremely convincing. Both actors put forth very convincing and enjoyable performances, not to mention an excellent however brief appearance by Laurence Fishburne. The tension was well played throughout the film both between the characters and with external events. However some of the emotion seemed to be cut short where I felt it needed to linger just a little longer in several scenes and series of scenes particularly later in the film. They also needed to spend just a little more time with the two of them at the end. It felt like they just ran out of time filming and had to end it right away. Overall a very enjoyable film that could even be extended further. This could possibly make for a good directors cut in the future."
" If you are a fan of either lead, SEE THIS MOVIE
",2018-06-17 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed PASSENGERS. Both Lawrence and Pratt are completely engrossing and play very sympathetic characters. Their romance is very believable, with its highs and its lows.There is one huge plot hole, although I agree it may be asking too much to want consistency from such a wildly futuristic plot. Lawrence's character says she has booked passage back to Earth after a year's stay on Homestead II. This means at Homestead II there must be technology to put people into hibernation. Does it make any sense that this technology would be on the remote bare-bones outpost, instead of on the ship itself? Not to me. But that would eviscerate the dilemma that drives the entire plot."
" A brilliant ensemble piece
",2018-06-08 00:00:00,9,"This is a brilliant, understated, ensemble piece about two people thrust together in an almost unimaginabley lonely environment. Their acting is simple but just enough to portray real emotions in a hostile and lonely environment. A job well done to them both."
" I belive this is the best movie i've ever seen!
",2018-06-03 00:00:00,10,"I absolutly love the plot. It´s beautifully made, and the acting is great. This movie has it all, comedy, action, romantic et.c I cant see anyone dislike a movie like this, they how does is swanky ""i know it all, and the best movies where made during the early 1940s"" kind of people. I could have watched this movie for 10 more hours, seeing their whole life on the spaceship. its amazing and desserve a lot more cred!
."
" The ending could be MUCH better.
",2018-05-27 00:00:00,3,"The movie could end much better if they used the capsule that allowed hybernation one by one - say one month one of them sleeps, the other is awake, spending couple of days in between together - this way they could arrive to the end of they journey only 44-45 years older (hybernation time doesn't count as life time) and fullfill their wishes and dreams to see the new world."
" Overall a decent sci-fi flick
",2018-05-19 00:00:00,7,A good scenario and a decent budget for this movie made this one one of the better sci-fi movies in recent times.
" Not bad, but a bit glib
",2018-05-16 00:00:00,7,"The trailer for this film tells us that a man and a woman have been woken from suspended animation 30 years into a 120-year journey to a colony planet. With no prospect of returning to deep sleep, they appear to be doomed to spend the rest of their lives together (apart from a robot bartender). But maybe they will fall in love. And maybe they were woken for a reason... ...and the trailer is perfectly fair as far as it goes. But this film does something I love: it introduces something in its early stages which isn't in the trailer, and I can't say what because that really would be a spoiler. Suffice it to say that it is a major unforeseen - though not unforeseeable - influence on the dramatic dynamics of the story, and I loved it, even though I felt that it wasn't fully developed within the confines of the movie.It is fair to say that the hints in the trailer all develop during the movie, some as expected, some not, and they do so satisfyingly. Lawrence and Pratt are both very good, as are the underused Laurence Fishburne and Michael Sheen in a prize of a part as robot barman Arthur, programmed with a small amount of artificial intelligence, a slick line in bartender smalltalk, and a lamentable absence of discretion. I can imagine him jumping for joy when the script arrived.The special effects are excellent and the ""hardware"" side of the movie is good, with the spaceship itself well designed, both outside and - especially - within: the sets are hugely impressive. Science purists will be a little irritated to discover that the ship has a ""Gravity on/off"" switch, but this does result in one of the film's most effective action set pieces.But this is essentially a dramatic two-hander, and works very well as such for the most part, although I did find the ending to be a bit of an easy option in order to provide the audience with a happy ending which I didn't believe for a second, for a variety of reasons.Should I mention that Jennifer Lawrence in a swimming costume adds what was, for me, a further reason for seeing the film? I think I should."
" One of a Kind - of the Greatest
",2018-05-14 00:00:00,10,"(Please note that this review might contain spoilers).If you have enjoyed the historic sci-fi movie, 2001: A Space Odyssey, then you'll probably fall in love with Passengers (2016). There is a lot of choices for all sorts of professionals working in movie making, the novelist chooses what details he uses to build the story, the director selects the ways he sees fit to lead the actors, ..etc.; and in this movie it seems to me that all professionals have made the excellent choices. The story of Passengers (2016) is extremely balanced. For those who criticize some role that appeared and disappeared without reason, I want them to imagine how boring and complicated the story will be if extra characters were emotionally involved, or how strange it'll be for a major incident to affect only one person. The selection of how events went by, has made the story to bring heavy-weight ideas, about human emotional and reasonable behavior, how a crisis may affect reason and how reason changes a crisis. The story is a nicely ordered hard-core sci-fi, means the science facts were fully respected during all parts (not like other over-rated ridiculous sci-fi movies such as Arrival). Visuals are extraordinarily beautiful, alongside a very precise and professional directing. 
The start of the movie is pretty powerful, as the end is. Passengers is a great movie, and deserves general rating of 9 at least. 10/10 without a moment pause."
" Many critics got this so wrong
",2018-05-03 00:00:00,10,"This movie really touched me on many levels. First and foremost, it's a love story, a very complex one. Acted superbly IMHO by Chris & Jennifer. It is a total blend of genre's, maybe that's what threw some critics? But usually the stuff they love I find pretentious and boring, snobs really. This film is far from some simpleminded crap, it's quite complex in it's study of human emotions, existential crises and action/adventure/sci-fi. Beautiful, beautifully shot w/gorgeous actors, w/great chemistry. You'll really want to make up your own mind, don't let snobs rob you of a great film. This is so worth watching and I've seen it in 3D, 4K, HD, 4K again and I'd watch it at least every 6 mo's. Big movie fan, but I don't like time wasting crap, this is nothing of the sort. You feel for these characters and live vicariously through their extraordinary experiences. Highly recommended!!"
" I liked it.
",2018-04-24 00:00:00,10,"I really liked the movie. Both characters were extremely appealing. The story was believable.  In a weird way, it can give you hope. We need that now."
" Great
",2018-04-14 00:00:00,8,"Great stuff. About common topics as love, lonelyness and forgivness in a sci-fi enviroment. Great music, scenes and photo."
" Gosh I Love Jennifer Lawrence
",2018-04-10 00:00:00,5,"Passengers has a brilliant sci-fi premise, solid sci-fi special effects, and brainless sci-fi writing. The hibernation pods preserve a person in suspended animation for decades upon decades but once they turn off you can't turn them on again. It's impossible for them to malfunction accept for the fact that, oh wait, they just did so now I'm awake and stuck all by my lonesome left to die on a spaceship traveling on autopilot to some distant planet in 90 years that I won't see with no crew or captain around because their asleep and nobody else around, except, oh, there is somebody else around, there's actually a bunch of people around so I don't have to be all alone at all because I would just wake a bunch of people up starting with the sleeping beauty Aurora, tell her I did it, and live my life happily ever after with Jennifer Lawrence by my side and the rest of our colony of cool looking passengers. There's absolutely no controversy and zero conflict in doing that, especially if the ship that's in control is going so haywire and I can't fix anything or get back in my hibernation pod or weld through the escape pod doors and it takes 50 years to communicate a message back to earth plus I can't get a decent breakfast or coffee because I'm not a gold pass passenger and the only fun things to do are walk around on the outside of the ship in magnetic space boots and float around in space in space suits and jump on my bed and play dance party video games with no partner and basketball by myself and watch movies with no one and eat sushi and drink liquor by myself and my only buddy is an android bartender that looks and talks exactly like Michael Sheen. I'd be a pretty good free throw shooter but in a heartbeat I could be playing basketball 1 on 1 with Jennifer Lawrence.....yes, pretty sure I'm waking up Jennifer, dude. The passengers all took a risk. Passengers is almost sexy. Jennifer lets her butt out but I can't see it. Jenn's naked body looks like the dark side of the moon. Is a solar eclipse happening? The light on Jenn's butt is dimmer than a dying star. The shadow on Jennifer's glutes is darker than deep space. Lawrence's back is blacker than a black hole. Jennifer Lawrence's booty has less light on it than.....than a sunless galaxy. Ok, look, I love Jennifer Lawrence, and I'm definitely going to buy Passengers on Blu-Ray, but can I please see Jennifer, the hottest girl in the universe's side butt in natural light without all the dark shadowy effects? Gooooosh! Isn't there a sun nearby? I got to see Chris Pratt's butt full on, sexy for the ladies, but not so much for me. I would have given Passengers a 6 if not for all of the awfully cut Lawrence hot scenes, like when she goes swimming in the gravitational pool too, because it would have been way better. It actually would have been awesome."
" Great movie.
",2018-04-06 00:00:00,8,This movie was a delight to watch catching every scene with a perfect and clean scenery. Less is more. The fact the movie had four characters to show off made it so easy to connect with their emotion. An interesting movie plot executed correctly. This movie made you feel stranded with the characters. Perhaps the movie lost its way midway through with its multiple time lapses but other then that a great movie.
" Very enjoyable
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,8,"Very good movie, very well played. The plot was original. I recommend"
" Chris Pratt's character was creepy AF
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,5,"This movie was OK. I enjoyed it until the last 30 mins, then the script turned crap. The ending would have been much better if CP's character had actually sacrificed his life as his way of showing remorse. That sacrifice may have finally given JL's character the peace she needed. Because, hell what he did was unforgivable - it's like the premise of a horror movie.It's a shame because there was potential."
" Carries us along definately!
",2018-03-22 00:00:00,8,"Im falling in love with this scifi-romance genre (see ""Oblivion"").... it is just very captivating. This might seem like a very predictable movie at the beginning but, Once you get into it, then you will be enthralled. This is an emotional rollercoaster and deals with the subject also of what a ""lie"" does to a relationship. Very relatable. I do recommend it, together with ""Oblivion"""
" total waste of my time
",2018-03-22 00:00:00,1,"This is one of the worst movies I have seen .Total ridicules waste of talent and time.
Jen Lawrence should be ashamed of herself to take the money and make this movie"
" Operatic
",2018-03-18 00:00:00,8,"Flicks like this are what I call ""operatic"": It's a simple scenario fleshed out with a thinly reticulated plotline. Though I'm not an opera *fan*, I understand the attraction for some and have gotten varied mileage from the medium. The job of opera is to convince you that the core one-note-johnny plot concept is driven by truly powerful emotional, humanistic forces.And I feel that _Passengers_ comes pretty close to succeeding. It's got the finery of opera; astounding set, costume, and props work; great pacing via artful storyboarding and editing; fine acting; some truly great scripting. Newman's score is subdued, yet well-integrated with the action.From time-to-time a ball gets sorta dropped: No spoilers, but some of the depiction of tech work, particularly in the crisis toward the end, seems clumsily done.And, true to opera, we're left with a closing image that invites us to metabolize that simple plot as one vested with deep humanity and even redemption. Will it work for you? Who's to say?Loved Sheen's work, here. So nice to see him stretch a bit to play an AI automaton. A delight to watch!Anyway, with the caveats given above, I think it's safe to recommend the flick.An interesting side-note: The flick nicely dovetails themes of cosmic ennui, an abiding interest in truth as key to sustainable relationship, redemption, and interpersonal fulfillment. Gotta say: With so many flicks these days dropping hints--seemingly being picked up by many--that the eldritch Significant Other relationship as key to happiness concept is overrated, interesting to see a high-tech future sci-fi flick pushing against that androgynous, sexless tide.I mean... Is that a *perfect* ""date flick*, or WOT?(!)"
" IT A F....ING GOOD MOVIE I LOVE IT AND GOOD STORY
",2018-03-16 00:00:00,10,IT F...ING GOOD MOVIE I LOVE. IT AND GOOD STORY I CAN WATCH MOVIE 2 OR 3 TIMES A YEARS!!!!
" Ask yourself one question...
",2018-03-12 00:00:00,10,"Did you *love* Prometheus? If so, you'll love this one too. Same writer, which is why I'm giving this 10 stars when Passengers is actually realistically a 9.5.If Prometheus meant nothing to you (or you've never heard of it!), this movie was not written for you, so don't see it and certainly don't complain about it in the reviews."
" Beautifully realized technology
",2018-03-11 00:00:00,9,"Cons: I'll get this out of the way. One, a single autodoc for 5,258 is unreasonably stupid. No way in hell would the designers of such a vehicle think one autodoc was enough for this many people. BUT, it was required for the story so of course, it can be forgiven. Two, the design of the ship leans more toward esthetics and less toward practical considerations. After all, it could very well have been a tube shape and held more passengers in the process. Three, artificial gravity induced by centrifugal spin, would not ""turn off"" and ""turn on"" quite so quickly or easily. Nor would such a spin, or spin-stop, be executed without any outside force such as thrusters. None are in evidence. This can be forgiven.Pros: First, this film is visually stunning. I am simply gobsmacked at the production design and how much thought went into this starship and systems design. It's not ""The Enterprise"" and it's not ""Millennium Falcon,"" but it most certainly is beautiful. Of course, I know this runs counter to con number two above, but there's no reason why practical design cannot be visually pleasing too. This film is an excellent example of that.Suspension of disbelief is quite easy with this film. Many of the automated systems are just ""stupid"" enough to be convincing. Yes, they can change how they address you as a person, but they can also be wholly unaware of things that would concern a life-form with a limited lifespan. Two, we know that the gravity experienced on the ship is due to its spin. Some of the effects took advantage this simple fact. Three, there were some surprises. This is really hard to pull off with science fiction because just about every possible scenario has been presented. Still, a potential savior is there just long enough to gain sympathy and our couple is left to fend for themselves again. This is just good story telling. I was very satisfied with this film. It has gain a place amongst my favorites ""Blade Runner,"" ""Her,"" ""Ex Machina,"" ""Oblivion,"" and others.This is the new golden age of science fiction friends. Enjoy it while it lasts."
" I watched it 10 TIMES !
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,10,"Excellent movie! The best o 2016 ! Ignore the bad reviews just go and watch it!
You going to love it!"
" There's just something about this film.
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,10,"I'm not one to write reviews, in fact this is my first. However I feel this film needs it. I'll keep it short and sweet, but hopefully get my point across. I've rated this film a 10/10 which I have to add is rare for me to do so. This isn't because any one part of the film really stood out or because the story line is some sort of groundbreaking new idea that the world has ever seen, it's because, it's the first time in a very long time I not only don't seem to get sick of watching, but ever time im just browsing through my options of what to watch that night nearly every time I see passengers (if I don't watch it) I really find it hard not to pop it on, yet another time. Though nothing in this film could reinvent the wheel, everything is done right, the visuals and production are stunning, without over powering everything else. The story line, though not the greatest ever, does everything a good story line needs too, keeps you wanting more. All topped of with quality acting, not Oscar winning but really there's nothing to fault at all. In summary 'Passengers' won't change your reality on film, in my opinion, is just one of those films I think everyone should watch at least once on a quiet Friday night snuggled on the sofa with some good company on hand. And thats why I've given this 10/10."
" Meh for Blockbuster
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,7,"The casting was awesome. Story was wonderful, the cinematography rocked but there were some parts that dragged on. I saw it in the theater and then again on streaming. When I watched on streaming I definitely fast forwarded several times. Never a good sign for a movie."
" movie of last thousand years here is why
",2018-02-26 00:00:00,10,"I think that is last twenty years movie. Its appeal sure fullfilles every expectation without doubt. There is none unfinished promisses on this movie. Acting is also very much appreciated, and all scenes so well-directed / designed that takes u and a real time space travel. Besides special affect and usage of space as a plato is great."
" This is only one of best movie in the world...no one there..

" Spacial-moral problem
",2018-02-10 00:00:00,5,"If you want to see a different sci-fi, spacial movie, well, this is not the best option. 
It's a pity that this movie focuses more on the spatial problem than on the guilt of condemning someone to your own outcome. In fact, that was what most attracted me to the movie. That plan that makes you make a moral decision.
However, the strength of this approach was gradually diluted.
Nevertheless, it is an entertaining film, albeit by a whisker."
" Surprisingly great!
",2018-02-08 00:00:00,9,"The movie is surprisingly great. When I saw this first time, it didn't attract me because it seems like a drama. But I tried to watch it anyway. And then I amazed. The first thing came was the love story of Jim and Aurora. I'm kind of sick of love stories. But this one isn't boring and even it's interesting. The more I watched, the more I found out it's really a great film. So, I keep watching. Then the final part came and made me cried. Aurora's love on Jim is so strong and I even wished I would have that kind of boyfriend. When the movie's ended, it made me wonder one question. Those two didn't have kid(s)? :D"
" Liked it
",2018-02-06 00:00:00,10,"Plot, actors everything was perfect. Just makes person to fall in deep side of galaxy"
" Highly Entertaining
",2018-02-04 00:00:00,8,"I'm always up for a good sci-fi movie; however, after the critics ripped this movie to shreds it fell down my watch list. I don't know why I listen to critics, they typically do not enjoy the same movies as I do. I found this movie refreshingly entertaining with action, romance, and drama mixed into one. I do feel they probably could have expanded the film a little bit and utilized Laurence Fishburne's talents more. I do feel this would be an excellent movie to take in by yourself or with a significant other."
" As naive as teenagers
",2018-01-31 00:00:00,8,"This film is interesting because it is a big parable, a tale, a fairy tale even. No monsters. Just humans, one android, many robots and an enormous machine, a spacecraft built up with thousands of machines that have to work together in the most coordinated way.On its way to its 120-year-away destination, it meets with an enormous meteoroid and the shield is not strong enough. The meteoroid causes damage that will take about four to five years to come to the point of no return. It woke up one of the 5,000 passengers from hibernation. This passenger will survive alone for three years and then finally yield to the temptation of waking up a woman to bring his solitude to an end. He is a technician and knows a few things about the spacecraft. Aurora is the woman of his choice. He is a Jim of no special metaphor whereas the woman is the dawn of morning and the morning glory in this dark adventure that will bring them to their destination dead. The bartender, an android, had promised not to tell the woman but of course, he does. Never trust androids. They are programmed not to hide anything and not to tell lies. The situation of love and care becomes one of hate and rejection. Luckily the ship becomes a little bit berserk and the captain actually wakes up out of schedule. That will not last long because he will die within just a very few days. But Jim will have the captain's ID and a few other privileges and passwords.The captain dies and right after that, the promised major disruption happens. And Jim is alone with Aurora to stabilize the ship. A difficult task for two people who do not like each other very much at that point. They will succeed and Jim will die and will be resuscitated by some miracle mechanical medical doctor. So Jim and Aurora will get married, in a way, and they will have something like 87 years before reaching their destination which no longer is their destination. They will not reach it.So they decide to transform the spaceship, at least the main atrium in the center of the common passenger spaces into some garden of Eden. The Bible is buried under one million years of alluvia. Adam and Eve just cultivate a garden of Eden on the spacecraft somewhere far away, hence nowhere at all in distant immense and limitless space.And sure enough they do reach their destination and the crew is woken up and these crew members discover something like a rose garden in the forum of the spacecraft. Magic and romantic. Enjoy the fairy tale.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU"
" Great Acting, Great Special Effects, Best Movie I've Seen in at Least a Year
",2018-01-31 00:00:00,10,"This was the best movie I've seen for a very long time. It has great special effects, a haunting soundtrack, an interesting moral dilemma, a wonderful love story, and great acting."
" Generic Hollywood romantic drama
",2018-01-24 00:00:00,3,"Well, if you enjoy generic Hollywood romantic drama movies, with stereotypical gender roles, but with a space setting, this is the movie for you.
If you, like me, had enough of this formula, save 2 hours of your life, and watch an other movie in stead.
I've expected some serious and interesting sci-fi, but was disappointed."
" Passengers - an enjoyable movie
",2018-01-16 00:00:00,9,"There are a lot of spoiler alert in this review. Don't remember ever seeing any advertisements about this movie because I fast forward all advertisements on my DVR. The actors were really good, Jennifer Lawrence as Aurora, Chris Pratt as Jim Preston, Lawrence Fishburne as Gus Mancuso, Michael Sheen as Arthur, the android bartender, his character, to me was more interesting than the humans, human top and a pole that held him up that ran on tracks, Andy Garcia was a mystery to me, the only thing he did was get off the elevator and look around in amazement at the birds and trees on the spaceship at the end, nothing else. Jim Preston woke up 90 years to early because of a computer malfunction because of a space collision, he woke Aurora up three years latter, on purpose because he was a drowning man as Gus Mancuso puts it, a drowning person will take someone with him. Gus Mancuso woke up about the same time as Aurora because of a glitch in his hibernating pod that proved fatal to him. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and have watched it two or three times. If there are any negative reviews, watch it for yourself, make up your own mind. Don't let the minority rule the majority."
" BEST SF of 2016
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,10,Best SF of 2016. In my opinion is one of the best SF ever. The CGI is amazing. The story is mind blowing.
" It'll put you in a cryosleep
",2018-01-09 00:00:00,4,"A spacecraft is on a 120 year voyage from Earth to an alternate planet called Homestead 2. The passengers and crew have all being put in a form of cryosleep or an extended period of hibernation for the journey and both crew and passengers are supposed to wake up a few months before they arrive at Homestead 2. However, due to a malfunction with a couple of hibernation chambers a few people on board end up waking up 90 years earlier than they should do...Passengers has a fairly interesting premise and on paper it should have been a fairly thrilling and suspenseful ride. However, the way it is actually executed falls a long way short of where it needs to be in order for it to work in its entirety...There were a number of issues that I with this film; the fact that the film is pretty much devoid of suspense, tension or any kind of intensity for around 2/3 of its running time means that for most of the film you'll see Chris Pratt wandering round the ship (how he manages to navigate his way round it with such ease is anyone's guess). Lawrence and Pratt making doe-eyes at each other, they'll go to the bar together - rather creepily the bar and barman reminded me of the bar and barman in The Shining - was this deliberate or was this just me that thought this?The narrative is also a little weak; we don't learn much about the ship, or much about where everyone is going and their reasons for going. The romance between Lawrence and Pratt is unconvincing (this is even before she learns that he woke her up). I also couldn't get on board (no pun intended) with the idea of the ship actually needing a crew at all... I mean why were they there? The passengers that were awoken early seemed to be able to function without them and the ship was filled with high-tech computers and holograms that seemed to be able to assist the passengers anyway. For my recollection I don't recall the crew actually doing anything at the end to make themselves feel needed (although I was starting to switch off toward the end truth be told).Still it isn't all bad, the film has some exciting moments in its final third, the special effects are pretty good and Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence are both very good in their respective roles - although I would say that their acting chemistry is much stronger than their romantic chemistry.All told, Passengers lacks suspense, tension, intensity, and with underwritten characters and a rather poorly explained story you'll probably find yourself getting a very meagre return on the near 2 hours of your life that you'll spend watching this film."
" My Favourite film of all time.
",2018-01-07 00:00:00,10,"Wonderful film. The cast act their socks off. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence are so good & the storyline will leave you thinking, What if that was me? It's so good I've watched it 10 times in a year."
" A Surprising Gem
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,9,A simple enjoyable Sci-fi film with little/no violence (hoorah!).
" Not quite a sci-fi classic, but good fun
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"'Passengers' is an interesting sci-fi film, in that it doesn't involve aliens in any way! It has more in common with 'WALL-E', than it does with 'Alien' or 'Event Horizon', as it follows the spaceship Avalon (cool helix design, basically a giant cruise ship) on its way to Homestead II, starting a new colony 120 years from Earth. It's approximately 30min of 'Cast Away' (man trapped alone), 45min of love story and then 40min of 'Deepwater Horizon' (survival film)! No time period is given, but I assume it's ~100 years in the future.What works well is the casting - two boring people could not sustain this film, but by casting Hollywood's two best & brightest, it works wonders. Jim (Pratt) is accidentally awoken from his hibernation 90 years early and tries everything to get back to sleep and/or find a solution. Because he's a passenger and not crew, his options are limited. Eventually, Jim wakes up Aurora (Lawrence), which is handled well, and the two of them falling in love is as interesting as the shots of the galaxy outside the windows. Arthur (Sheen) as the android bartender is also a nice touch. The only other person to get some screen time near the end is Gus (Fishburne), who finally figures out what's wrong and kick-starts the final stanza.It's not hard to watch when you have Jennifer Lawrence is a pool - but as well as being extremely attractive, it helps that both her and Pratt are very charismatic and able to carry out the tender moments and the exciting ones. The shots of the ship in motion and the galaxy in the background are fantastic, and while a bit of it is predictable, it's a decent ride. Solid ending too."
" Like watching paint dry
",2017-12-30 00:00:00,1,"This may not be the most boring movie I have ever seen but I think it is. For the first hour nothing happens. Then nothing happens for another hour. Finally you are relieved to see the words ""The End"" on the screen. 
What a relief."
" A case where critics ruined the movie from the very beginning
",2017-12-26 00:00:00,7,"I have watched this movie twice, first time was in a Sat night on Fox channel. Been heard many bad things about it, one of them was 'I don't even know what point this film is trying to make'. So I did not expect anything decent from it. 
To be honest, those bad reviews are absolutely garbage! I mean c'mon, this is not a sci-fi blockbuster likes 2001: A Space Odyssey or Star-Trek but a love story in space. Even though there are some plot holes (but which movie doesn't have any?) and cliche moment, it turns out to be quite alright. The story, the characters, the atmosphere, the pace, they are all okay. There is at least a cohesion in the plot, which I highly appreciate after several so-called blockbusters that supposed to blow people's mind away this year. Yes, it is a simple movie, but it is good at it own way and doesn't try to live up to any franchise or imitate any other popular trend.
The only drawback of this movie is that Jenifer Lawrence looks absolutely stunning in every shot, even when she just woken up from several decades of hibernation. That's unrealistic!"
" Technically good, but most predictable plot ever!
",2017-12-24 00:00:00,5,"From a technical standpoint a great movie with great cgi and fairly good camera work. But story telling really lacks depth and complexion, if this isn't your first movie you will know how every scene plays out 5 mins before.."
" Chick Flick In Space
",2017-12-20 00:00:00,4,"If you like a good chick flick then Passengers is the film for you. One unlucky fellow on his way to another star system gets woken up due to ship damage only part way through his 100+ year voyage. Unable to get himself get back into cryo sleep for the rest of the voyage he does what any red blooded male would do, he finds the hottest chick on the passenger manifest and wakes her up too. This brain box however doesn't wake up someone with some technical skill to help him fox the problem however, no he wakes up the hot chick writer with zero skills.Anyway the chick flick part kicks in full for now, first she loves him, then she hates him, then she loves him again, then they live happily ever after after fixing the ship thanks to a five minute part by Laurence Fishbourne. Anyway its predictable as all hell and try not to laugh, or yawn at all the clichés."
" I really enjoyed this sci-fi romance
",2017-12-14 00:00:00,9,"After reading some so-so reviews of this movie I was all set to be disappointed.
The movie was a pleasant surprise however and I really liked it.
The psychology of what happens when Chris Pratt's character does what he does and how it affects the relationship was well done. It added a tenseness to the drama. The ending had to happen the way it did as the story is really an inversion of a classic fairy tale.
Michael Sheen stole the movie for me as the bartender robot. He was pretty hilarious.
This is a great movie that has quite a wide appeal in that it's not a sci-fi flick that just caters to nerdy guys (for what it's worth I am a nerdy guy with an astrophysics degree, but I like sci-fi that tries something a bit different. I'm hoping for a sci-fi musical next!)"
" Passengers is a great movie.
",2017-12-12 00:00:00,8,"Great movie, good acting. Very good and interesting plot. Special effect's are amazing, and Jennifer got some hot moments! :)))"
" Good date-night movie.
",2017-12-03 00:00:00,7,"I took my wife to see this movie the day after Christmas. I really enjoyed watching Chris Pratt, who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. He and Jennifer have good chemistry here and the story keeps you engaged even through the parts that normally would be ""slow"" if it had been poorly written. Some suspense, good action for a drama and even some funny parts. I wouldn't recommend it for children but this movie has most everything you could ask for with a minimum number of actors. I thought the ending was done well too. It's out on video now but definitely worth renting."
" Deceiving, cliché, and then predictable and a waste of time
",2017-11-26 00:00:00,1,"The producers did an excellent job of completely deceiving the audience with the previews for this movie. Depicting this as a film where two people are victims of something mysteriously gone wrong aboard a spaceship, with an insinuation that something nefarious is also afoot could not be farther from the actual plot of this movie. The bottom line for spending two hours watching this movie is that the Oscars needs to add an award category for biggest selfish jerk character in a movie for Jim and an anti-climactic, non- mysterious, non-nefarious, and predictable ""I can't live without you"" ending. Jim, an actual victim of something gone wrong on a spaceship (the cliché meteor shower), spends a year alone living it up until he gets bored and then struggles to but finally decides the right thing to do is to make someone else (Aurora) suffer so he doesn't have to be the only person on the ship who is screwed. Of course after Aurora learns this she is angry but then, predictably, works with and later decides to forego her only opportunity to save herself to grow old and die with Jim. The premise is cliché and redundant, the acting is typical because of this, and with the exception of the really cool ship the movie is a waste of time."
" Entertaining Story and Superb Acting
",2017-11-19 00:00:00,8,"Not sure why this one got bashed so hard by critics. The premise could be considered creepy, that he woke her up, but the man was facing his entire life alone. It would be a very tough decision. Critics seemed to think this was a fuzzy happy ever after where she forgave him and the central issue was never really dealt with.However, I felt for a movie, which is purely for entertainment purposes, it was dealt with sufficient to lead to a happy ending, and personally I like movies with happy endings and forgiveness. The critics seemed to ignore two key elements of the story, first that the man was destined to live the rest of his life alone or make the decision to wake another passenger, something as a mechanic he had the skills to do. Was his decision ethical? No. Realistic? Yes. Put in his shoes what would you do? The second very important fact that critics seem to ignore was in the third scene when he had to exit the ship to fix a critical malfunction that if not fixed could cost them both and the entire ship their lives. As he exits the ship she says to him "" come back to me, I can't live here alone without you."" Effectively confirming that if he died, which was a real possibility, she would be in his shoes, the shoes he was in when he made the decision to wake her, and with that realization, at that moment she understood why he made the decision to wake her. Remember, she did not have the knowledge to wake another passenger as he did, but the basic human need for companionship she did understand. It was from this premise, having to face this reality, that she was able to forgive him and also make the decision to stay awake with him rather than be put back to sleep.Critics seem to think her forgiveness and decision at the end was based on true love, a corny thing that does not exist, but I did not see it that way at all,I saw it as her realization of what he had been living, that really it could have been any of them that had been woken up accidentally to begin with, and that if he did not come back alive then she would be the one alone for the rest of her life, and she was desperate to not be alone, and from that understanding she found the compassion to forgive. I think love for him was an afterthought to this realization and perhaps the tipping point to her final decision rather than the reason for forgiveness.Was it perfectly politically correct? No. Was it a great story about compassion and forgiveness? Yes, even more so than a love story to me, the deeper story was the basic human need for companionship, the love story being second to that. Was it entertaining? Yes. If you want to see the grim reality of how horrible life can be, watch the news. If you want to be entertained with a happy ending, watch this movie."
" An abundantly clichéd, melodramatic slog...
",2017-11-18 00:00:00,4,"I was quite surprised that it got mostly negative reviews last year, it seemed promising. Now I know why. It is an abundantly clichéd, melodramatic slog that squanders potential to explore deep humanistic themes and twist its narrative, instead coping out with underdeveloped romance and cheap thrills. It ends up being Titanic in space. Aside from its dazzling and immersive production design and music, Passengers is nothing new or interesting."
" Real science fiction for the masses
",2017-11-14 00:00:00,9,"As I write this in my Star Trek pajamas, I can honestly say I did not feel the need to nick-pick the heck out of the technical details of this movie and instead actually enjoyed it for what it is: true science fiction, and one that is written to appeal to everyone.Sure I could sit here and talk about how they couldn't possibly reach Arcturus in 30 years without going FTL (faster than light), why the computer would heat the whole ship for one person, or why it carried spare parts with only a crew for 4 months to use them, but I won't.I won't because science fiction is about wonder, it's about what might happen, and what sort of world our descendants might live in. Passengers does that. It comments on our future total trust in technology. The visuals are incredible. The ship is imaginative. The acting is superb, and the characters are truly believable - the ""superheroes"" here are as common a person as you or I.And frankly, it's refreshing to watch some science fiction that does not center around robots, superheroes, robot superheroes, some form of time travel, or all of the above in one (ahem, X-Men: DOFP).If like me you want Hollywood to make more movies like this, go out there and buy it. twice. And prove the critics should get strapped into some hibernation pods to become a future generation's problem!"
" Coolant Leak!!
",2017-11-12 00:00:00,5,"""Coolant leak i have to dump the core!"" ""System malfunctioning i have to override manually!"" Does the warp core ejection system ever work? Who designs these ships? Visually some scenes were good.The part where Jennifer was swimming and the gravity shut off was cool. Nothing wrong with seeing Jennifer in a bathing suit. Outside of that nothing special about this movie. Didn't buy the 'Stockholm Syndrome'story. Found it a bit creepy."
" Space Romance
",2017-11-09 00:00:00,8,"This movie is a romance spiced up by a very interesting context and one that fortunately gets its rightful benefit although without going too deep into this future because first of all Passengers is a film that leans more towards romance, simplistic and effective. So if one is waiting for a good science fiction movie or something else is not going to find, but if you judge the tape for what it is, it has an 8/10, is well raised and fortunately its errors are not relevant superior or negatively affect the whole, so it is an enjoyable and entertaining movie that makes good use of its context to tell a story that ends in a predictable but adorable way."
" A Poor Caricature of Science-Fiction
",2017-11-08 00:00:00,4,"Passengers fundamentally failure is it seems to bear no attempt to intrigue, interest or engage its audience. Just like Jim (Chris Pratt) and Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence) we are trapped aboard the Starship Avalon in a never-ending circuit of time and space. However, they are aware that death is waiting for them. Watching these film makes one wish for death. The main issue lies within the setting; Avalon is seemingly influenced by early iPods. It is white and pristine, yet offers very little in terms of personality. Almost like an iPod fresh out of a box, no music or memories and therefore no character or depth. The narrative is tied to the ship and as such it should serve as a tertiary character. But it does not, rather is serves as a characterisation of the film in its lack of distinctive features. Narratively Passengers offers a conundrum. It desperately wants us to like Jim, it wants us to buy into him as another extension of brand Pratt - a lovable doofus with human intentions. However, he comes across as slimy and creepy. Whereas Aurora's character is in the most simple terms annoying. The film insists on reminding us every 5 minutes that she is a writer, just in case we forget. Her role in the film is to fall in and out of love with Jim. Beyond that, she lacks depth.A more interesting premise would be if the film was shot from the perspective of Aurora. Therefore Jim's character would be represented as more nefarious. The story lacks a big central dilemma that actually engages the audience. We are meant to root for our heroes to find a way to fix the ship, but I spent a good portion of the filming hoping for critical engine failure.If you are looking for a fun space romp with a likable front man look elsewhere. Buy Chris Pratt's Guardians of the Galaxy Lego figure and trap him in an egg box for 2 hours."
" Sci-Fi at it's best!
",2017-11-02 00:00:00,10,"This is a movie that almost has it all. Those who didn't like it were probably disappointed by the lack of earthling fighting alien scenes, because there were none. It's more like Gravity, except much better.I've always been disappointed by the lack of good science fiction movies. While it's fun to see alien/earthling battles, science offers fiction so many other possibilities, although we mostly just concentrate on those that are the most outlandish. But it's actually quite fun to dream about what may be realistically possible and isn't out of the realm of reality.That's where Passengers exceeded greatly, despite the liberties taken with some scientific truths. The movie presented a futuristic, realistic situation and explored it to the hilt, while throwing in some drama and romance along the way. The romantic subplot was also done very well, even though it was only a subplot. The futuristic gadgets were interesting and provided intrigue, as well.The movie explores a future world that's quite believable and possible, so I think this must have been what it was like to read Asimov, Clarke or Verne in their time. This is coming from a viewer who hated the last 3 Star Wars movies, but considers Bicentennial Man one of the better Sci-Fi movies in recent times, so take my opinion for what it's worth to you."

" Non-violent, psychological sci-fi
",2017-10-31 00:00:00,8,"My sci-fi preference is for hard science fiction. I like as much science accuracy as possible. In that vein, I also prefer psychological realism. I can't relate if the portrayal of what people do and say are too far out of sink with how they would really act. I have gotten more selective with what I watch because of these things. I dislike being disappointed after I watch a movie or read a book. For instance, I disliked Star Wars Force Awakens. I'm even a bit forgiving toward the prequels. But I think that Force Awakens stretched coherence too far. But that deserves its own post. I just watched Passengers (2016). I had reservations because multiple reviews illustrated how much of the science was wrong and about the abusive action of Pratt's character. But I liked the idea that it didn't have any intentional antagonists. So I rented it. Yes, it did get rather loose with the science. But I thought that it had a compelling story and interesting character portrayals. I thought that the positives outweighed the negatives. You see, another thing with which I've gotten bored is the antagonist / protagonist method of story telling. Some people claim that Pratt's character is the antagonist. But I think of the character as being someone who intends to be a good guy but makes a horrible mistake. The end result is that I felt that Passengers had enough for me to consider it to be enjoyable science fiction. It had a good concept, generally good story progression, likable characters and no enemies. That being said, it really could have done better by the science without being detrimental to the story. But I will watch it again."
" Entertaining
",2017-10-29 00:00:00,8,"I hadn't even ever heard of the film until I found myself watching it and I must say I was thoroughly entertained and surprised especially by Chris Pratt's (who for a great deal of the running time was alone on screen) acting skills. Jennifer Lawrence is Jennifer Lawrence, she is always going to give you that. Great chemistry, great acting, decent plot. I loved it."
" Take it for what it is, and enjoy it
",2017-10-27 00:00:00,8,"Ignore the ridiculous criticism from people with some political gender agenda.Keep in mind it is Sci Fi. There has never been a science fiction (or adventure) movie, that was without flaws, impossible situations, ridiculous leaps in the plot, etc.Just enjoy the movie for what it is. There is a lot to love about it."
" Bland hokum
",2017-10-27 00:00:00,5,"Chris Pratt is out of his depth next to the always brilliant Jennifer Lawrence, who lifts every film she's in. The film turns on Chris Pratt's character waking Jennifer Lawrence from cryogenic sleep, and the ultimate love story at the film's heart leaves a disturbing possibility: it would be easy to read this film as a tract encouraging women to stay with abusive partners, given that Chris Pratt effectively murders Lawrence's character and she stays with him at the end. I'm prepared - just - to think better of it because Lawrence is an intelligent and powerful actress, but the film is ultimately ordinary with a bitter aftertaste. There are much better, and more thought-provoking, sci-fi love films out there."
" it's a romance, and not that
",2017-10-25 00:00:00,5,"The problem I have with this film is not the sci-fi part.I think that is amazing: Utopian travel to a distant world etc. Great.Effects are amazing. Portrayal of the experience of being in space etc, definitely on a par with Gravity.The problem I have is with the premise that someone can fall in love with someone who basically shafted them for some selfish need.So I'm OK with the first half, but then I have to stop the film.I'm not going into more detail as that would be too much spoilers.Watch the first half, then when you the bit where it all seems wrong just stop there.When she starts to get over the what he did.You'll understand what I mean when you get to it soon after the 90mins mark.Just switch off at that point having watched a really good film."
" Romance and sci-fi in outer space
",2017-10-24 00:00:00,7,"Although 'Passengers' had one of the most unique concepts of any film in recent years, had talented actors on board and the production values looked wonderful from the advertising, the critical reception (not just from critics but also from those who dislike Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence and immediately saying the film would be terrible, not being ignorant this actually happened) was a turn off.Seeing it with my flatmate last night, who had seen the film before, really liked it and had recommended it to me, 'Passengers' turned out to be a much better film than expected. It's not perfect and can see where some of the criticisms are coming from, but it was to me a beautiful and thought-provoking film that raised some interesting questions and thoughts. Unlike a lot of people on the internet and particularly on IMDb, critics get a lot of respect from me and often we are on the same page. There have been a fair share of times where our opinions have been different, when a praised film didn't do much for me and a panned one surprised me in a good way. 'Passengers' is one of the latter examples and a lot of the problem with its less than enthusiastic critical response is to do with advertising which didn't indicate that it would be as unconventional as it was.For one thing 'Passengers' looks wonderful, the advertising didn't lie in this regard. It's beautifully shot and crisply edited while the lighting and sets have a lot of atmosphere and are imaginative in their scope, showing the beauty, wonder and mysteriousness of outer space. It is easy to see why the production design garnered an Oscar nomination The special effects at their best make the jaw drop.Don't think that Thomas Newman's score has been talked about enough despite being nominated for an Oscar (losing out to 'La La Land'), it's understated and hauntingly beautiful in a distinctive Newman. 'La La Land' deserved the win but of the other Best Original Score nominees (which included 'Jackie', which should never have been nominated) 'Passengers' for me was one of the better ones.There are many moments where 'Passengers' provokes a lot of thought and is intriguing, raising some very interesting questions and ideas. The story on the most part didn't lose me, while it is not your conventional thrilling sci-fi film with lots of special effects and action it has its fair share of poignancy and intrigue. The initial fiery animosity turning into a beautiful love story was convincing thanks to the chemistry between Pratt and Lawrence. The direction isn't mind-blowing but is competent before not knowing what to do with itself in the final quarter or so.Pratt is more understated than usual, in a cast against type dramatic role for an actor better known for comedy. He handles it very well and commands the screen. Lawrence gets a lot of hate here, but to me she is one of the better actresses today under 30 (her acting actually has a beyond her years feel to it). Here she is luminous and touching. Believed these two as lovers and found myself caring for their love story due to their success in keeping it alive. It's not just them though, Michael Sheen is amusing as Arthur and while his screen time is short (too short) Laurence Fishburne gives his characters pathos and dignity.On the other hand, 'Passengers' doesn't live up to full potential. Its biggest flaw is the last 30 minutes, it would have worked better as something more suspense or action-oriented but instead felt like a tacked on logic-free anti-climax where too many things felt unresolved and it was too over-the-top and ridiculous.While the writing did intrigue and provoked a lot of thought, it didn't always work. Some of it did get confusingly over-complicated, with things needing to be made clearer and less vague, and other parts were forced. Pacing also could have tightened in places, the beginning while interesting in what was explored takes a little long to get going but the film really gets going properly once Lawrence's character wakes up.In conclusion, was not sure what to expect but got a well above-average, to me it was good despite a few problems. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
" A wasted opportunity
",2017-10-23 00:00:00,5,"This movie is set in a ship designed to make a 90 years flight to Homestead II, a new planet where humans can live in. Less than halfway through the journey, two people end up getting out of their hibernation state, forced to live the rest of their lives on the ship. But there's a bigger problem laying underneath their early wake that they'll have to face.Thing is, even though the plot is promising I don't think it was explored enough, so this movie ends up being a ""just good"" movie, rounded but with nothing to impress the viewer in any way.What they could also done is get an actor and an actress interesting enough that they make the movie interesting to watch, but we got two of the most popular personalities in a, I think, attempt to make more sells, since they pretty much do the promotion of the movie with their names on it. I'm not saying that they're not good, but Lawrence and Pratt were not good choices for a movie really needed haunting faces to save it.Passengers is not great, but not bad really. Just a forgettable movie that's probably not worth your time."
" Predictably not working
",2017-10-23 00:00:00,1,"I love Chris, I love Jeniffer, but this is totally wrong to cast them as lovers. Not to mention the sex scene...It feels like watching two siblings having incest. Even worse: we love Chris as a great family man and husband, watching the character he played to fall in love with another woman on screen in detailed process, is so awkward. The other huge weakness of this movie is the lack of suspense and surprise. Right, one man and one woman are trapped on an isolated island/spaceship and then they fall in love, period. Really? Blue lagoon worked only because Brooke Shields was young and hot in bikini. Also, why someone would freeze themselves for so many years to go to another planet? Leaving everyone you know on earth and will not meet again. Why all these passengers bought their one way tickets? I am just not convinced people would do such a thing. Finally, what is the purpose or philosophy of this story? What would audience get or learn from this story? I got nothing except a lot of screen time of two big stars."
" Gripping story and a fantastic movie
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,9,"One of the most genuinely exciting movies in recent years. I loved the story which was original in its concept, I loved the characters which all served a purpose and were lovable, I loved the ending which really kept me guessing. So much feeling, great acting - I can honestly say this is one of the best movies I have seen. I find it hard to think of anything I didn't like about this movie really..."
" Original, engaging sci-fi drama
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,8,"The spaceship Avalon is on a 120-year voyage to colonise the planet Homestead II. On board are 258 crew and 5,000 passengers, the first inhabitants of the planet. They will be in hibernation for nearly all of the 120 years. However, after only 30 years, one of the passengers, Jim Preston, is awoken from his hibernation. Try as he might, he cannot re-hibernate himself. He resigns himself to not living to see the end of the voyage. Out of loneliness, he thinks of de-hibernating one of the female passengers...Very good, and surprisingly so. Based on the trailers it looked like a basic, B-grade sci fi-adventure movie. However, it is far better than that. Highly original plot that is also quite plausible. The physics of the events, actions and sub-plots seems reasonably sound (though I'm no astrophysicist). No jarring moments where you think ""That's not right...""Quite engaging too. The whole stranded-in-space central plot is intriguing and explores some very interesting themes.Some good adventure and a touch of romance, plus a fairly emotional ending, make for a great movie."
" Highly underrated
",2017-10-16 00:00:00,8,"When I first seen the reviews of Passengers I held off watching it until it came out on DVD, and after I finished watching it, I was very surprised at the bad reviews. This is not a bad movie, but also not a great one either.The movie starts off very, very well with some absolutely spectacular set pieces, visuals and sound. I haven't seen set pieces this good since the Empire Strikes Back. They truly are a work of art. In the opening we are introduced to Chris Pratt's character, Jim. And in this first act of the film, Chris gives without question his best acting ever. Not only because of how good he is here, but how he breaks out of his usual typecasting funny, clumsy loon, who makes a fool of himself, here he is an isolated mess, with a very Jesus like look. This in my opinion was the best part of this movie, as it deals with what we all fear most, being alone. The second act changes from a drama to a romance movie, when Jennifer Lawrence's character Aurora is introduced. I really believed Jennifer in this role, her character was well thought out and I wanted to know more about her background. The chemistry between Chris and Jennifer was flawless, they truly worked well on screen, which I was glad for. If not this movie would have fell flat on its face. This is however, where the movie slows down a lot, and may turn a lot of people off. It gets bogged down in very corny romance, and I must say, very steamy sex scenes for the rating it has. It's not a bad section of the movie, but I really did think it got very slow and predictable.The third act changes into a thriller, and is handled very well. While I'm no science expert, I think some of the space scenes were a little far fetched and during this section we are introduced to Laurence Fishburne's character, who was pretty much just there, he doesn't do much at all and his underdeveloped character didn't have anything interesting to do at all. Passengers is a very underrated movie, and it irritated me greatly about its reviews, even more so when the piece of trash Ghostbusters 2016 got more positive reactions by idiotic critics. This movie won't be for everyone, some will hate the slow paced romance, but if you like that, this movie will please you.8.3/10"
" Could have been soo good, but they ruined it..
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,6,"What really annoys me about this movie is that it could have been truly amazing. The first 30 minutes introduce a very intriguing world with lots of interesting ideas about colonizing other planets, space travel, habitation pods and the social aspect of it. The visuals are amazing, the design of the space ship is compelling and then we have a fantastic moral dilemma: Our protagonist can either destroy other lives to save his own or die a martyr death. What will he do? How will it turn out? Will he just wake up one person he or will he trigger a chain reaction and therefore kill the entire project? Will those people even get along with each other or will there be some Shining/Lord of the Flies-esque situation in space. Oh man, this could have been so good..But then Hollywood hammers this movie into their mold of convention. First of all we know exactly he will wake her up because Jennifer Lawrence is on every stupid movie poster. That whole montage of him contemplating whether to do it or not is such a waste of time - it's only purpose is to show that he is actually a really good character who only acts out of desperation and not because he is evil. But it is Hollywood after all and there has to be a love story whether you like it or not. So how can we make him good again in the eyes of the audience and his love interest? Well easy, after his morally reprehensible decision he just goes through the whole shebang of rectifying his character: He willingly accepts punishment from her, suffers in silence, literally burns in a cleansing fire and in the end selflessly offers his own life in order to first save others and then to undo his mistake. It's the ultimate price and that is why we all including Aurora can forgive him and their happy end makes perfect sense. Her character has nothing to it, is extremely predictable and only exists as a counterpart to his persona.I'm sure Pratt and Lawrence did what they could with the material they were given, but the writing is unfortunate and I really wish this would have been an Indie movie with unknown actors and a story that we haven't already seen a gazillion times before."
" My recommendation: Watch the trailer and decide for yourself
",2017-10-12 00:00:00,5,"'PASSENGERS' - 2016Directed by Morten TyldumStarring Chris Pratt, Jennifer Lawrence and Michael SheenPlot Overview: ​On a routine journey through space to a new home, two passengers, sleeping in suspended animation, are awakened 90 years too early when their ship malfunctions. As Jim and Aurora face living the rest of their lives on board, with every luxury they could ever ask for, they begin to fall for each other, unable to deny their intense attraction until they discover the ship is in grave danger. With the lives of 5,000 sleeping passengers at stake, only Jim and Aurora can save them all.I won't lie to you by saying that I was put off seeing this movie by the rotten tomatoes score. I know, I know - that score isn't the be all and end all of movie criticism but, considering I didn't care for the movie prior to seeing it advertised, I decided to see if most people saw it worth watching. And they of course did not. It was near universally panned by critics, but very warmly received by audiences. And I have to say that I stand firmly in the centre of the two. Passengers is a perfectly average, disposable movie. It's not good but it is not bad. It's not something you NEED to watch but I don't exactly discourage you from doing so. Were there moments that I enjoyed? Absolutely. I admire aspects of this film, but by the same token loathe others. Of course, I'll elaborate on that further along but what I will say is that this film may or may not be worth your time, watch the trailer and find out. Let me begin with the positives. The visuals of this film. Any and all effects used in this film are pretty much breathtaking and look absolutely gorgeous. Then, there is the excellent cinematography. Editing could have used more refinement but it wasn't offensively bad. The set design of the ship was very interesting and I really liked it. It's no 'Nostromo' but it was still a very visually interesting ship. Then we have the performances. No one in this movie does a poor job. In fact, all the performances range from above-average to good. Pratt was good as Jim as was Lawrence as Aurora. Michael Sheen was good as Arthur. All the performances in this movie were at least good and none of them were bad. But the problem wasn't with the acting, it was with the chemistry, writing and character development. None of the relationships were refined and none of them felt natural. It just felt so manufactured and contrived. And manufacturing emotion NEVER works in a film!My other main flaw with the movie was the entirety of the last act. I actually enjoyed the first 2 acts of this movie. They were at least entertaining. But, without spoilers, I thought the last act of this movie was so dumb and over the top. It was so utterly disappointing and they could've done so, so much more with it.As a whole, I wasn't a huge fan of passengers. It wasn't good but it also wasn't bad. I don't regret seeing it but I'm sure I could've spent my time more wisely. It's a film that just does not deliver for me. If it interests you, then please watch it; you may very well enjoy it. I watched it out of morbid curiosity(and it was free). Watch it if it interests you but if it doesn't then you don't need to. I'll rate 'PASSENGERS' 5 'Bartender Tricks' out of 10!"
" Spoiler warning
",2017-10-09 00:00:00,9,"Warning a little spoiler So I was thinking about the end of this movie I wish when Jim told Aurora about the sleep cabinet there's one and there's one auto doctor or whatever it is ,they could've get in cabinet together and call Arthur to close it for them and voila, but they can make second part of the movie including my idea so what do you guys think about it"
" Actually pretty good
",2017-10-07 00:00:00,8,"I was actually enticed to watch this movie after listening to its Chinese promotional song ('Light Years Away' by G.E.M.). The Chinese promotional trailer/song was better than the movie (which they usually are), but the movie was still quite good. Although having a dark, depressing concept, the movie itself was fairly light and almost feel good. There was a part of me that wanted it to be darker and to further explore the morality of Jim's actions, but I'm sort've glad they didn't make it feel lonely and lost. I'm surprised the critic reviews have been as bad as they are, considering this really wasn't a bad movie. Sure, it wasn't a masterpiece in terms of themes, feel and storyline, but it was engaging enough and quite unique. The visuals were excellent and so was the bartender android. A good romantic movie to watch."
" Exceptional commentary piece paired with compelling performances!
",2017-10-03 00:00:00,9,"Acting: 20/20 Writing: 36/40 Directing/Editing/Production/Etc: 37/40Overall: 93/100 AReview: As with many space movies, there are quite a few unrealistic plot holes in the script but aside from those few, the movie is pretty accurate.All of the cast in this film delivered compelling performances, playing their roles perfectly.This film is not your typical pop film (nor a typical sci-fi film as it's more of a romantic-drama-sci-fi), every little nuance shows a deeper meaning and weaves together a great analogy of our roles in nature.*Spoiler Alert! *Michael Sheen does an exceptional job as the bartender, especially the part where he ""spazzes out"" when presented with contradictory ""facts"" as he knows them to be. The writing and concept behind this character, as an android bartender, is very well done. (""Jim, these are not robot questions."")There are a couple of cool allusions in this film, such as The Time Machine, The Shining, Facebook and Sleeping Beauty.This movie shows the value of human companionship as well as romance - even for a man.This movie had a lot of interesting choices and points regarding gender: When Aurora first gets a meal and sees what Jim has been stuck eating this whole time, this is an allusion to the way a bachelor eats before a woman comes into his life and starts to cook for him (traditionally), leading to better and healthier meals for him. Jim as a mechanic, represents men and the old world, and the desire to feel ""necessary"". With technology replacing workers and pushes for women replacing men in the workplace (to fulfill 50/50 gender quotas) - as well as the fact that men can't give birth - men in Western society are struggling to find their value/role in the world. Our modern Western society is very sexist against men and constantly putting them down as ""old-timey"", unnecessary and overall ""not good enough"". Our society treats men very unjustly, constantly putting women's feelings and preferences first, while condemning men simply for being men (aka toxic masculinity). Men are people too and just like women, they like to feel valued in society. Love was enough for Jim to be content but not for Aurora, as she was still having a lot of anxiety about their situation after they became romantically involved. Just like humanity works best when men and women are cooperating instead of competing, the two passengers were able to save the ship and everyone on it (aside from the already deceased Chief) when they were cooperating and working together as a team.Aurora had everything she could've asked for, yet it wasn't good enough just because Jim woke her up instead of her accidentally waking up. She had romance and a reliable, loving, trustworthy mate and she still had her career as a writer for audiences of the future to read her once-in-a-lifetime story, even though it wasn't the exact one that she had originally planned for. She took what she had for granted, more focused on what could/should be, rather than what was. She couldn't see the forest for the trees.After all of the crap that Aurora gave Jim for waking her up early, she had the chance to ""erase this mistake"" yet she chose not to. In the end, she chose the life that Jim had chosen for her as well. So she gave him hell for nothing. This is very representative of how if many modern women today would focus on everything they do have instead of what they don't have, they would realize that they have a lot to be grateful and happy for. Western women are the most spoiled women on Earth yet they often fail to see that. And one of the most important overall metaphors from this film revolved around nature:Nature will not be controlled forever.There was a point made several times in this film about the ""fact that the pods can't possibly defect"", yet we know that's not a fact as somehow, someway, Jim's pod did defect - even though it was the 1st time ""ever"". This was very important because it was very symbolic of our modern society and the everyday things we take for granted - especially modern women who would choose ""modern society"" over ""nature's society"" almost every single time (since they benefit from this modern society even more than men do).To this point as well, nature always finds a way to create life; It's why human beings are here. No matter how many extinction periods have occurred here on Earth and wiped out entire species at a time, nature always finds a way to give new life a chance. This was represented by the planting of nature that Jim did all around the information room (especially at the end) but also by both of Jim and Aurora's urge to not be alone, as many human beings feel this way - not in just a romantic sense but in an overall sense (which is why we, humans, often try to create some kind of society).*End of Spoiler Alert!*Overall this film was an exceptional commentary piece paired with compelling performances; Absolutely worth watching!"

" If you want Sci-Fi, skip this movie! ***SPOILERS***
",2017-10-03 00:00:00,7,"***SPOLIERS BELOW***This movie is OK and it does have Sci-Fi elements in it, but that's not the main point of this flick. I did not expect this plot, based on the trailer.This is basically a love/hate/fall back in love - story, that just so happens to occur in space.Yes, the characters are on a space ship. Yes, a malfunctioning piece of sci-fi technology sets up the rest of the movie. But, the movie is basically a romance flick that's set in outer space. If you like that premise, then you'll like this movie.Personally, I liked Arthur (Michael Sheen's character) more than the other two (well, three) main characters on the ship. I felt sorry for Arthur when he got ""hurt"" more than I did for Aurora (JL), Jim (CP) or Gus (LF). Note: Arthur is a robot bartender.The movie did cause me to reflect on what I would do in Jim's situation, but I still ended up disliking Jim for the choice that he made.I went along with most of the script flaws, but the scene with the reactor repair was too silly to gloss over.This movie was better than the typical ""alien gets on-board a spacecraft and kills the crew"" movie (that we've seen a lot lately), but the trailers are misleading, IMO."
" Simple and predictable, but amusing
",2017-09-30 00:00:00,7,"Without entering in much technical sci-fi, it is still a good movie to think about when we think about the space and our future.A spiky love story and a bit of action. Do not expect THE movie.Simple and predictable, but amusing.Just watch it. Why not?"

If you are older than 7 and/or your IQ>70, do not watch or you'll suffer greatly. There is no S in that movie, just F. Unless S stands for ""stupid"", not ""science"" anymore, which is quite possible, seeing the last 10 years in SF genre. I rated it ""3"", it is a real rating, not a lowered one to bring a balance. A spaceship is sent for a 120-years long journey, with no human supervision. There are backup systems for everything, but cannot be used: no awake humans on board to make repairs. There is a 300-persons crew, but hibernated, doing nothing during all the flight (what are they for?). The empty ship is well lit, all the monitors are on, the temperature and atmosphere are controlled. Just in case, somebody can always drop in. A meteor hit causes a very strange malfunction which makes a man wake up (we can compare it to the Titanic hitting an iceberg which causes turning on one of passengers' radio. Possible, but surprising). It turns out a ""Help"" function in a spaceship's OS is designed by a MicroSoft employee, so the passenger learns nothing useful. He tries to contact the tech support, but that, in turn, is as easy as contact with Adobe's tech support. He travels in economy class, so he gets only a junk food (millions watts of energy can be thrown into the mud every second - heating, light, computers etc., the space journey itself must cost millions for one person, but a decent coffee (worth a quarter) can not be spent). When you travel one way 100 years to build a colony, the money from the home land has absolutely no sense, only a real value counts (imagine Robinson Crusoe on his island with a box of dollars). But Jim is charged for a call to Earth (with payment in several centuries). When our anti-hero starts to be bored, he decides to take somebody down with him. Because why not? Does he wake up somebody who can help him? No. He chooses carefully somebody he can... well, you know what. A blonde chick. She must be stupid enough to believe him, so he goes for a journalist. Bingo. The girl wants to go and see the first year of colonization and than go back to Earth. How? She forgot it was not possible to get hibernated again, so her return was not possible. Nobody told her? Moreover, how did she intend to go back? On foot? I don't think they were going to let her take the gigantic colonization spaceship back to Earth, they probably were going to use it to build a colony. So, our cruel, selfish hero sees he has chosen right. They plant a tree in hall. Why? How? The seed? The dirt? Watering? Fertilization? Then, the malfunction grows. Some pots fall down from the ceiling. Another man awakes, pure coincidence that he is a member of ship's crew. So he tells how to repair the ship and dies. He knows he cannot live, nor wake up another crewman who can repair the ship, because it would break a harmony of our love-birds (or rather a horny deviant and his brainless victim). A gravity fails. Newton's laws fail (e.g. swimming in a water bubble, a sudden stop of spaceship's spinning after power failure). Everything fails. But they survive passing very close to the star (the ship at 1/2 c would crash, hitting the particles emitted from the star, and/or the star's gravity would tear it to pieces), survive staring into opened reactor, etc. And of course, there has to be a most funny moment with a rope. In space, your rope is never long enough. If you don't know the distance, cut a piece of rope and measure it. If it is 321 yards long, the distance is about 323, for sure. In every SF film lately there is a scene with too short a rope (From ""Gravity"" to ""The Martian""). People! If you ever go to space, prepare a rope that is 3 yards longer than you think it will be needed! Bad acting (J. Lawrence was especially wooden, but both lead characters lacked any depth). Stupid screenplay. No scientific consultation. The SF movies can totally omit science and logic if they don't pretend to be serious, e.g. Star Wars. But if the movie tries to be deep, serious, SCIENCE-fiction, the screenplay shouldn't contain gigantic errors and gaps, too big for a 10-years schoolboy. Now I am waiting for a sequel: a girl gets old, so Jim - our hero - throws her to the reactor and wakes up a second girl. Why not? Or five of them."
" Actors' charms can't save tone-deaf plot
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,4,"Jennifer Lawrence and Michael Sheen bring a lot of life and sparkle to this woefully ill-conceived spaceship soap opera. Chris Pratt's character does something unforgivable about a third of the way in, and the rest of the film was impossible to accept as written. If this were a French movie, it would've ended in a murder-suicide and rightfully so. Nice production design and score."
" A Sci-Fi and Romance Mix with Impresive CGI Effects!
",2017-09-23 00:00:00,10,"I wish I had seen this on a bigger screen. Movie critics also panned ""John Carter"" which was a great movie as well. It is so obvious that many of the professional critics are not Sci-Fi fans, by the way they battered a very likable film. A bit like ""When World's Collide"" and ""Titanic in Space"". It's a little predictable and implausible as well. One passenger on a journey to a new world wakes up 89 years too soon, when his suspended animation pod ""blows a fuse"". Judging on all the skills he has knowledge of, he's not a mechanical engineer, he's ""Scotty"" or ""Spock"" from Star Trek! He wakes up another passenger on purpose as he appears to need good-looking female companionship and stimulation. The first half of the film is a bit slow, but the ""space walk"" and tour of the ship is fascinating. It's certainly a lot better-paced than the slow motion reveal in Star Trek I. In hour 2, everything falls apart including the space ship's power core. First their love affair freezes over when she discovers that he woke her up. One crew member wakes up, just long enough before dying to keep the spaceship ""afloat"". Then as the power core overheats, the power fails, they both turn into ""Astronauts"" and go outside the ship to unjam a stuck emergency vent and each other. He should have died, but she revives him using the super-dooper DIY medical machine. (Really!) Also, why isn't he burned (or radioactive) from the engine breach? Why it works for us space movie ""nuts"": Great CGI. When all gravity fails, the swimming pool rises up and turns into an (almost) death trap. It's enjoyable and exciting and has a pleasant (yes, predictable) happy ending. On my ""Starz"" version the slight nudity might be cable-edited?"
" Illogical Plot
",2017-09-18 00:00:00,1,"A ship on full autopilot would, when detecting a problem or malfunction, awaken senior members of the command staff, not a minor engineer. They would then awaken necessary repair staff. An android bartender who works but no (HAL 9000) type computer monitoring things is illogical.Jim could also have awaken the command staff to make repairs and fix a pod so both Jim and Aurora could go back into hibernation, so neither has to die."
" Perhaps the most satisfying sci-fi of the year
",2017-09-16 00:00:00,10,"I'll briefly begin with a cursory summary of the plot, then delve into what makes this an awesome movie.Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence are both travelling on a ship headed to a distant colony. All the passengers and crew are in cryopods; a type of suspended animation so that they arrive at their destination still at the age they were when they left Earth.While the system is meant to be self-correcting, and the crew is supposed to awaken if anything malfunctions, only the Chris Pratt's pod opens; presumably due to a malfunction. He is alone on the ship, in the sense that everyone else is still ""sleeping"". Unless he wakes up another passenger, he will live the rest of his life without any company, like a prisoner in solitary confinement.After some soul searching, he decides to wake up a passenger, Jennifer Lawrence. While he is poor, and in third class, she's in first class. She took the trip to write a book about the experience. He took it as an opportunity for a new life, much like many of the poor Irish passengers on the Titanic in steerage.Although they hit it off after a rocky start, she eventually learns her pod did not open due to a malfunction; he woke her up. In effect, he has robbed her of her life, at least the life she wanted on the distant planet, where she'd write a book on her travels.Their feud is interrupted by more malfunctions all over the ship. That's all I will reveal. Best you see the remainder yourself.What's good about the film? Not to be cavalier and flippant, but really everything. Besides being excellent actors, Pratt and Lawrence have good chemistry in the movie; we buy into their romance. Unlike a ""heavy mental"" over-the-top movie like Interplanetary, Passengers is a romping good time, full of action, thrills, and suspense. It doesn't try to impress us with cutting edge ideas such as Arrival.Unlike Arrival or Interplanetary, Passengers is a movie I could easily watch a second or third time. It's a great movie experience. I found very little I could fault with the movie; it was a clever, tension-packed plot, well scripted, well acted, and the pace didn't lag. While some people invariably complain about the middle of movies going too slow, this one kept our attention throughout. After all, we know something.... something, is wrong aboard the ship, but at first our two protagonists are able to shrug it off. They are minor inconveniences.Passengers is an example of sci-fi done right. Do we really want science fiction that does its best to confound us with a plot so overly complicated and full of physics quandaries that we can't make heads or tails of some scenes? I know they were trying to out-do 2001: A Space Odyssey, but thanks, no thanks. Arrival was similarly irritating in the sense that I just didn't buy into the plot.Passengers has a rock solid plot, easy to grasp, and entertaining to watch unfold."
" Not the Starship Enterprise
",2017-09-16 00:00:00,7,"If you are fascinated of what the future may bring, this film depicts some of those possibilities, artificial intelligence, space travel, and colonization.Jim Preston, mechanical engineer (Chris Pratt), Aurora Lane, writer (Jennifer Lawrence), and Arthur, android bartender (Michael Sheen) are aboard the starship Avalon with its 5,000 colonists and 258 crew members when Chris' hibernation chamber malfunctions and he is awaken in the 30th year of their 120 year journey. His only companion when he awakes is Arthur the android bartender.While watching this film, you may find yourself wondering, would I volunteer for a colonization? How long would I be able to remain in isolation? How would I have reacted if I were Aurora? Good flick on a rainy Saturday afternoon."
" If you can handle an absurd setup, this film delivers on many levels
",2017-09-15 00:00:00,7,"Passengers is almost a set piece given how few characters inhabit the screen at any time. Only JLaw's ""Hunger Games"" histrionics jarred me (she always seems to be shouting with the same intensity and with the same facial expressions)...but otherwise she was spot-on. I found the acting, especially by Chris Pratt, very believable. Chris Pratt has some absurd facial prosthetics which are rather laughable, but he has a very natural demeanor though a bit too teary-eyed at times. He plays a hunk who's not self-aware of his hunkiness. // Anyway, what truly bothered me throughout the movie was the total ridiculousness of the setup that propels the story forward. You have to buy an absurd premise for the rest of the movie to make any sense. Very annoying and shows, IMHO, lazy script writing. BTW, beautiful special effects throughout."
" Space Crap
",2017-09-12 00:00:00,1,"It's bad science fiction, it's bad storytelling, and it's bad cinema. First of all, it's 2 hours too long so there's bad direction and editing too. Chris Pratt was not too bad but Jennifer Lawrence needs a lot of growth as an actress. And bad science too: the spinning spacecraft doesn't just stop all of a sudden when a computer is overloaded (and why should that happen) because there's a thing called ""momentum"". So the ""gravity"" would not instantaneously disappear and leave poor Jennifer drowning in her swimming pool (albeit we get to watch her swim and drown and gasp). But for plots, Jennifer pouts for 2 hours about ""you've killed me"" instead of ""you saved me from dying on this broken ship"". They could have had kids. Hey, she got to write a story. Could have been better. Bad waste of money, Sony."
" Alone in Space
",2017-09-12 00:00:00,7,"Not the worst film you will every see, plenty to enjoy here including the acting of the main 3 characters, lots of comments on here about the morality of waking Aurora up and how she could have ever forgiven Jim but seeing that saving the ship was a 2 person job and Gus wasn't around for long everyone would have died if he didn't wake her up so his decision was life saving for everyone on board the ship. Surprised that there wasn't any children running around the ship at the end"
" Amazing first half, disappointing second half
",2017-09-12 00:00:00,6,"*Contains Spoilers*This is a really difficult review to write actually. I watched the first half of Passengers the other day and was absolutely hooked. Couldn't stop thinking about it for the next two days and couldn't wait to get the chance to watch the rest, which I did with my partner, and I was so disappointed by the second half, it felt almost like a completely different film to me. So regarding to the first half, I absolutely loved the idea and the personal dilemma the main character is going through. It's a plausible issue as well, and it's very well acted by Chris Pratt. I thought this film had a lot of potential and could potentially have gone into a very interesting direction. Instead, it then does a little bit of a U-turn and went about as mainstream as it gets. And I'm not saying this because I hate mainstream films and need twists and turns every second, or because I only watch super arty films which I don't, but because it got so utterly predictable and cheesy that I found it hard to watch after a while. Overall Passengers was definitely not a waste of time and very entertaining in parts, but being a filmmaker myself I just couldn't stop thinking about the immense potential this film had and all the ways they could have gone with it, apart from choosing a very very stereotypical, Hollywood romance route. Bonus points though for acting on both sides, for stunning cinematography and effects and for the bar scenes which really reminded me of ""The Shining""."
" Flat and uneventful for the most part
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,5,"'Passengers' was one of the most interesting looking films of 2016, but it left me disappointed. This is a sci-fi/romance film, but it spends so much time dilly-dallying that neither theme is properly developed. Why are we forced to watch Chris Pratt aimlessly wonder around a spaceship for such a large chunk of the film? During this time practically nothing of significance happens. It's unnecessary and uninteresting.It's only after Jennifer Lawrence's character is awoken that 'Passengers' properly starts. It picks up in the second half and there are a few a moments where the film feels like its going somewhere, but it never really does. For the most part, it's flat. The suspense is limited to only a few scenes and there just isn't enough going on to maintain your interest until the end. 'Passengers' isn't a bad film, but it's a disappointing one, especially when you consider its potential."
" Average at best
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,4,"The technology is magnificent, the actors are great, the visual effects are amazing, everything its really outstanding... But oh boy, the script is a pain, totally ruined the film for me. So much potential wasted. I was expecting a Battlestar Galactica level of deep thinking, but instead we got too much petty drama that only miss fart jokes.This easily could have been one of the best sci-fi movies of all time, but in the end was average at best..I would rate 6, but -1 for not showing dat bootyy. Yea, you know the scene that I'm talking about! Camera man, you failed us!!"
" Not what is says on the tin
",2017-09-10 00:00:00,2,"The trailer makes it look like an accident brings them together because they have been woken to fix an problem that only they can fix, right?Nope!!! CP is woken first, then he sees JL in a pod that makes his winky twitch so he wakes her up after stalking her profile on the ships records. He doesn't look for anyone, or a team of people, who may be able to fix his problem, he decides that he will pick this one person to wake up and die on the ship and never fulfill her dreams (the reason she is on the ship).The fist bit of the film is nice enough, watching him deal with being alone... kind of a 'castaway in space' feel to it. But was better than what happened next.Anyway, she finds out. Then they must not have thought of how to make her like him again so they wouldn't die on other ends of the ship, so they throw in a problem, wake up Morpheus, just to kill him when his use has been fulfilled and then they love each other again.If it was what the trailer promised it could have been interesting, but it wasn't. it went from 'oohhh I wonder when her pod will pop and how will they meet', to, 'What a creep' and eyerolls pretty quick."
" Crusoe and Girl Friday.
",2017-09-10 00:00:00,7,"Pretty much reviled by professional critics, Passengers has overcome that to hold affection with a good portion of the sci-fi loving public. More safe sci-fi footings than anything remotely ground breaking, it ends up a a tidy romantic piece that's laced with pertinent questions involving man and his/her reactions to extraordinary scenario's.Although the viewer is for the most part hankering for action to explode off the screen, it's only when - in the film's last quarter - you realise that it was actually working fine as a character study without the fireworks.Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence have bunches of charisma, in fact more than enough to carry the story through its more shaky elements. They in turn are aided by Michael Sheen who is perfectly cast as the Android (not Robot!) bartender Arthur.The effects work is impressive and director Morten Tyldum stitches the set pieces together admirably, the highlight being a rather superb gravity loss sequence. While the sound mix is also to be applauded.Newcomers should expect a Robinson Crusoe love story in space as opposed to a sci-fi actioner, though one with more cerebral strains than at first hinted, because then the pic delivers a good time and adds to what is turning out to be a rather great decade for sci-fi fans. 7/10"
" Don't believe the critics, see it for yourself and decide
",2017-09-09 00:00:00,8,"Before I saw this movie, I remember seeing articles about how cruel the central premise was. I decided to give it a watch and came out feeling glad I watched it. The movie did a good job showing how tough it was for Jim to make the decision to wake up Aurora and the writers did not try to justify it or pretend it was the right decision. He struggles with the decision both before and after. Aurora is not treated as merely the love interest. The way she reacts is raw, emotional, and realistic. Without giving the ending away, I feel like the writers did a good job portraying both perspectives and the ending was satisfying. As a fan of science fiction (Arrival, Interstellar, Gravity are all recent movies that I really loved) I was very happy with this film. It has everything - strong actors, great special effects, and an interesting story that will leave you wondering how you would have reacted to the same situation.Chris Pratt makes a great central character and Jennifer Lawrence does a nice job as the co-lead. Overall, I would recommend it if you're a fan of the genre."
" Not Great , but entertaining
",2017-09-07 00:00:00,7,Decent film worth a look. Watched it on my cell phone while cooking. I love Chris Pratt and find Jennifer Lawrence annoying. Nice chemistry between the two of them. Dump stupid spaceship plot. Wasted lots of money on special effects which I didn't care about. Would have been better to have simple romance plot.
" An atmospheric smart Sci-fi movie that gets better with re-viewing. (spoilers)
",2017-09-06 00:00:00,8,"The visuals and set designs are fantastic and make you believe you are on the ship. Its a shame they couldn't reuse the sets for another show about the running of the ship over the centuries (or a sequel with an entirely different plot)The acting is good and the situation is haunting. What would you do in their situation etc.?spoilers followI really liked the idea of the cascade failure of redundant computer monitoring systems due to the meteor.The only real plot hole is the lack of some sort of plan for something like this happening on the ship. No matter how advanced this would be certain to happen given how long the ship is traveling and how many trips it is likely to make. I let it go though as this plot hole sets the necessary stage for the rest of the movie. Such ""it cant fail"" design arrogance has been seen before it will probably be seen again. (The Titanic disaster comes to mind etc)"
" Spectacular film.
",2017-09-06 00:00:00,10,"This is one of the best films I've ever seen. As a 26-year-old avid movie-watcher and literary-appreciator, the script is INCREDIBLE. What an idea for a movie, not to mention marvelous execution of what the fallout of waking up (and being woken up) from a 120-year journey ninety years early would actually have been like. What I'm saying is, this is one of the better movies ever made. The acting is superb, though even I'll admit the stretch with Martin Lawrence was a little... stupid. But who cares. What I see here, personally, is a film that literally could have been out-of-this-world extraordinary, but decided to take an ounce of humility instead, for the sake of not being ""too heavy"" or ""too boring"". Honestly, I saw this in theaters and just watched it again a second time and it was literally BETTER THE SECOND TIME. Seriously. So what is specifically so great about it, you ask? Well, let me break it down for you.To start, this is not a ""Hollywood"" script written for ""Hollywood"" actors. The script is fantastic in its own right, and I'm not exaggerating here. What an excellent script. The fact that they got A- list actors like Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence on board is really no surprise when you see how good the dialogue and transpiring of events are. Now, the finale is a little rushed, yes, compared to the slow, flawless pacing of everything before that, but there really was nowhere else to go at that point. The writer obviously wanted to challenge himself a little bit. Regardless, it was a great ending, in my opinion. See, this is also kind of a love story, so just be ready for that is all I can say. Anyway, the film also kinda brought sci-fi back for me. Don't get me wrong, I've read some of the goofs, I know some tiny details in the film would not have happened the way they did strictly from a scientific standpoint, but there are no major plot holes because of scientific inaccuracy. Which is very refreshing. Especially when everything else is done so well, like in this film Passengers. A good sci-fi film is hard to come by, in any case. A lot of times the dialogue and plot of the film can end up being really dumb, which is the opposite of what we have here. I feel like Passengers would've been a really good book. I mean, the writer had it dead-on. Everything the actors said and everything that happened was so believable. I feel like it could've gone on for hours and I would still have been completely captivated. Maybe that's kind of the secret. He had to wrap it up somehow. And as for me, I couldn't have dreamed of a better ending. Aside from that, awesome sets. I mean, any sci-fi lover can appreciate just the stunning sets that make up the inside of the ship and its rooms. So 5 stars. 2 thumbs up. However you wanna put it. I can't say I'll still like this film 20 years from now, but I just wanted to go on the record and say this film definitely deserves more than thirty-whatnot percent on Rotten Tomatoes. I mean that's pretty harsh. Besides, I did love this film. It might not be flawless, but it had the right spirit, the right heart. Not superficial, which is probably what the average person thought upon seeing the trailer. And like I said, I loved it, so there. And did I mention I loved it?"

He's Alone, but he's surrounded by sleeping people...What would you do?For a Science Fiction movie, it moved at a leisurely pace...Sans Space Battles, Sans slavering Aliens, Sans Homicidal Central Computers, Sans crawling outer-space monsters...It's an accidental relationship movie on a ship light-years in the middle of nowhere...The Premise was believable.The Characters were likable. Their Actions ... 'Stood to Reason' The Moral Question was commendable. The Spaceship was AWESOME.

" Cliché and unrealistic love
",2017-08-30 00:00:00,3,"I simply cannot imagine how Aurora could love the main hero after learning what he did. Their love story was boring and cliché. It would have been much more interesting to see if they didn't fall in love, Aurora turned out to be really strange not like the idolized vision of the protagonist, or straight up started hating him, or their relationship was treated more like what it really was- a toxic one started because they were both the only ones there. The ship had a nice design though? That's a plus."
" A good story with relateable characters
",2017-08-28 00:00:00,7,"This is a Robinson Crusoe story at its heart, and it deals with that subject well enough that I recommend this movie. It has a lot of humor and human empathy in the characters, the sets are really cool, and the space graphics are very entertaining.The science is a bit of a wreck, but it's not ""Robert Heinlein's 'Passengers'"" is it? You can read the ""goofs"" section to get an idea of what's off and decide if that ruins it for you.I loved it. I really did. SciFi doesn't get enough coverage. This is only mildly sci-fi, and is mostly just good storytelling."

" Terrible Film
",2017-08-21 00:00:00,2,"I won't bother going over the absurdity of the science in this film. Like so many have already pointed out I find the actions of the Chris Pratt character and the way the film resolves it utterly despicable. Ask yourself if he had been an overweight balding 40 year old would his actions be more acceptable. SPOILER ALERT COMING UP. DON'T READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS DROSSShe is angry and feels betrayed when she finds out what he has done. She accuses him of murder but of course she forgives this hunk and falls in love with him. Oh so sweet. how can one not fail to be moved. I was welling up at this stage. At what do you know, for those of you heartless people who are still unmoved due to the questionable actions of our hero. Would you believe he gets to save the day with acts of incredible heroism. He saves the ship, he saves the lives of the crew and passengers. What a guy.And would you believe at the end, what does he find ?. A hibernation pod, whatever so our heroine can go back into deep sleep and reawaken to achieve her dreams. Unfortunately there is only one so this presents our hero with the opportunity to atone for his actions. And there the film ends, but no, that's where you're wrong. True love triumphs in the end and she stays with him. This is so lovely, Who could fail to be moved."

" Accidentally on Purpose.
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,6,"Passengers is a highly enjoyable film to watch, however, it feels like it was one thing, that meant to be another, or, it was one thing, made to be another. The angle Passengers took makes me dismiss all its science, not because it may be wrong, like, really wrong, but rather, because science seems almost moot in this particular Science Fiction.Passengers almost feels like a wasted premise... This movie, though again I'll repeat - very enjoyable, needed a more accomplished director at the helm, like the director of The Imitation Game for instance. Yes, I know it's Morten Tyldum too, but this film didn't quite have that edge.The romance conundrum was pretty great, and what would've made it completely marvelous is how Jim would fix it all... Sadly, I'm not sure Jim did fix it. A happy ending for an unforgivable act was imposed, at the cost of intense emotional depth. What Jim did was wrong, and though his situation wasn't his fault, it wasn't Aurora's either, and Aurora being afraid of being alone, doesn't make it right.Sure, had Jim not woken Aurora, everybody would've died... But, at the point of his decision, Jim didn't know this, but, if the argument is fate, then...This film should've never been advertised as a Sci-Fi, but rather, a Romance Drama Adventure, and needed that edge, that depth, that quality acting ability that Jennifer Lawrence can harness.Passengers meant to be a 7+/10, but accidentally became a 6.4/10."
" A Tree grows in Avalon
",2017-08-15 00:00:00,10,"The Homestead company makes money colonizing planets. On board the fusion powered, ion drive ship, Avalon are 5,000 passengers and 288 crew, all in hibernation. When an asteroid hits the ship in the first scene, it damages the ship, but it fails to self repair itself. Mechanic/Engineer Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) and uptown girl write Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence) are awaken 90 years too early and eventually discover (plot spoiler?) the ship is destined for life support failure unless it can be repaired.While the film is billed as a love story, I found it equally compelling as science fiction. I think they could have written better dialogue for Jim, or maybe had someone else in that role less good looking in order to make their differences more acute...like Woody Harrelson. But, they wanted the film to appeal to women to so they cleverly added a love story in order to get women to watch boring science fiction...or did they add science fiction to a love story in order to get guys to watch it? Either way, the film was enjoyable, although may have been about a dozen minutes too long. I liked the special effects, especially the zero gravity swimming pool scene. Really cool.Some geek stuff: In the film they approach the red giant star Arcturus (didn't look too red). It is 36.7 light years away, about the time they have been traveling in 30-40 tears. However, according to their dialogue, they are traveling at half the speed of light which means it would take them 73 years to get there. Just saying.Guide: No swearing or nudity. Implied sex."

",2017-08-13 00:00:00,9,"I am a woman and a feminist, yet was sickened by those attacking this film as legitimizing rape culture, manipulation, Stockholm syndrome or God knows what else. People thinking along these lines probably find most tomato sauce labels politically incorrect.The plot is plausible and interesting, the acting excellent, the cinematography beautiful, and the film is quite well-paced. It might not be Oscar worthy, but the last time I checked, most films out there aren't.So he woke her up. Yes, it was immoral and selfish, but the film does not depict Jim as jumping into this decision. The fact that it took him weeks to decide, that he was alone for over a year and had almost committed suicide by no means justify his action but do show him struggle with the weight of the decision. Just like it weighs on him throughout the film. All that makes him human -- selfish and flawed, but far from evil.And Aurora is NO pushover. Once she finds out, she doesn't meekly accept her fate as a man's playmate or bed-mate or whatever, but literally kicks the living daylights out of him.If the film merely jumped to ""she finds out and accepts"" and stopped there, I could understand people panning it. But it doesn't. It ultimately shows us that she CHOSE to be with him -- which is critical -- and also shows us why. She'd never let anyone in before, had actually fallen in love with him before finding out the truth, and subsequently saw enough bravery and love -- including him wanting to let her go -- to realize life was better with him on the ship, than without him. Point in case: by joining the voyage she chose to leave everyone she ever knew behind forever, showing us she didn't have any deep connections prior to him.As for those complaining about the ""token black character"" -- come on, people. The film only has two big roles. If one of those had been a black person, then the whole movie would have been interpreted as an allegory for racial dynamics. If the only other prominent character had been black -- the bartender -- the film would have been accused of reducing black people to servants again. How about the fact that this important crew position was filled by a black man, and he was key to saving the two white people's behinds? Why marginalize him, as a viewer?Lastly, I'm sad that poor Jennifer Lawrence was pushed into thinking there was anything wrong with the film, let alone that it would have been better if her character had woken up first. I mean, come on -- it would have been EXACTLY the same, morally speaking. That's the whole point -- what he did had no excuse, but it brought them together in a flawed way like life tends to, and they overcame that bad beginning both individually and together.In a nutshell, it's a dynamic, suspenseful love story set in space, so if the sound of that appeals to you, by all means watch away for you're sure to enjoy it."
" Not Great, but an Enjoyable Trip
",2017-08-12 00:00:00,8,"This is not a great movie. This is even not ""One to watch"", but this movie is an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours on a Saturday night.The movie start with a death sentence. Computer error wakes Jim up 30 years into a 120 year hibernation and condemns him to die before reaching his destination. A year later, he has explored the whole ship and tried everything to get himself back into hibernation and reach his new home. Then he sees Aurora and falls in love with her after researching her life and watching her personal videos. After much debate he finally falls victim to his loneliness and wakes her up in the need for human contact and the love he has developed.The accusations of date rape are absurd. Aurora falls in love with Jim. She makes a conscious choice for this. She doesn't sleep with him or fall in love with him through pity, or fear, she does so through personal choice. I want to make this clear and also to make the point that most of the junk being thrown at this movie is because Jim woke up first. If it was Aurora who had woke up Jim then the movie would probably have won 17 Oscars and been held as a rallying cry for women in Space!The movie has a lot going for it. The characters are deep, well meaning and best of all, flawed. Jim has a lot of difficulties being alone and Aurora has intimacy issues illustrated by her videos from her old friends. Humans are not perfect and neither of the protagonists are painted as such. The physics are just the right side of believable (even using the gravity of a star to create kinetic energy) and although this is just a love story, there is more about it than a standard Hollywood movie.The ending is written to give the viewer the idea of just how much can be achieved in a lifetime. The logistics of this are arguable, but as this is set in an unknown time in the future, how can you disagree?All in all, a well spent couple of hours dreaming of Space."
" Lawrence carries (just barely) this middle of the road sci-fi yarn.
",2017-08-12 00:00:00,6,"*** This Review May Contain Spoilers! ***As far as sci-fi goes, I'd put Passengers in the middle of the road. CGI was passable with some nice eye candy - clearly they spent a few bucks on it. The story, though, was sub par - boy meets girl in outer space, they get in on, they have a fight, and boy has to do something really far out to win girl back. Pratt's acting was not bad, and the chemistry between him and Lawrence was a plus yet I felt that Jennifer Lawrence's presence and acting skills carried the film. And what guy, unless he was gay, wouldn't want to get marooned in deep space with Jennifer Lawrence? I'm certainly in - at least for a couple of weeksAbout halfway through the film Chris Pratt had a solo scene, and low and behold, a fly danced around his head - this, of course happening after coming out of 30 years of suspended animation. I rewound a bit and played back the scene to be sure - yep, the little guy definitely flew in for a cameo. You'd think in a CGI extravaganza that someone would have done a bit of touch-up. But I guess they hadn't booked enough time in the editing room.The pool was killer, complete with a huge dome-like glass window extending out the ship's side revealing an eye-popping starry panorama. The only problem with this picture was that the habitable portion of the gargantuan ship was rotating to simulate earth's gravity and the view through the window looking out from the pool had the stars in a fixed position. Whoops!Speaking of gravity, when push came to shove near the end of the film, a worsening system-wide power failure killed the power and along with it the gravity. Everything just began floating around in zero Gs. Good for special effects maybe, but the visuals in the film went to great lengths again and again to show this huge habitable superstructure rotating to generate its gravitational field. The power failure shouldn't have had any effect upon the ship's gravity. Either they didn't care or the writer has to brush up on his physics."
" In Space, No One Can Hear You Snore
",2017-08-11 00:00:00,3,"I find it ironic that the premise of this saga Involves a couple of space travelers who are awakened from their long distance suspended animation chambers to pursue date night melodramatic action when it made me yawn like I was at an insurance seminar on subrogation ... see you're already getting drowsy. The screenplay appears to have been jotted down during a morning metro ride into the city and I'm talking a short commute here. Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt ( Tom Brady doppelgänger ) engage in kozmic romance and stuff until Lawrence realizes she had a few more decades of nap time coming thus setting off an intergalactic spat. I suppose you could call it a severe case of premature evacuation. The domestic quarrel simmered for a quite a while until I felt like I was ready for a spaceship sleep chamber. The genre of this flick may be characterized as existential light with a heavy dollop of astromance or, alternatively, a version of an interplanetary Sleeping Beauty where the Prince shoulda backed off. Robotic servants abound throughout the ship so that the idea of Pratt's loneliness leading to an irresponsible action in order to sate his pathetic plight seems ridiculous considering any number of sexbots or love cyborgs could have been made available and no, there aren't any space limitations on board because the interior looks titanic. Plus eventually both leads are going to get old and saggy ... along with nowhere to go and nothing to do so I only see this ending in alcohol dependence or worse. Also, what's with the bar re-creation from "" The Shining "" that implies a macabre setting which is antithetical to the essence of our wacky lovebirds or is it trying to tie into the alleged Apollo space mission symbolism by Kubrick? I was too tired to care. I magnanimously gave it a 3 because Lawrence is generally charismatic and I didn't watch it all the way to the end which may be slightly unfair. However, unless some gruesome aliens attack the ship at some point, I don't foresee any potential increase in entertainment value. I figure these two bored narcissists will eventually unplug all the passengers from their techno-coma and then all hell will break loose as the passageways are overflowing with diarrhea like a celestial cruise line disaster. Viewing this one will put you in a deep sleep state, earthling."
" Not entirely sure, how someone could give this movie less than 8, definitely one of the TOP 10 movies in my life
",2017-08-10 00:00:00,10,"Am not gonna write much about this movie. I've seen TONS of movies. I'm 33 years old and...well, if You like sci-fi, romance, and a really good drama and a sort of an happy ending, with super-ultra high gradual and graduating - everything. Effects, acting performance, sounds, immersion, etc......this is the movie for You."
" Poorly written story can not produce a good movie
",2017-08-08 00:00:00,3,"When you start with a poorly written story, neither good actors, or fancy visual effects can make it a good movie. 5000 passengers + 258 crew are hibernating for 120 years on a spaceship running on autopilot.....only 120 years, nothing could go wrong, sweet dreams everybody. If this ship is so smart that it can fly for 120 years by itself, why it needs a crew of 258 ? .....help with a luggage at arrival ? This ridiculous story and movie, pretending to be some-kind-of sci-fi romance / adventure.....total failure, with plenty of eye-candy visual effects."
" Another weak female character drifting through the vastness of interstellar plot holes
",2017-08-07 00:00:00,3,"I'm sorry, I want to like this movie but I have a real hard time getting past the central theme of it. This is a movie about a man, who when fate cruelly but effectively takes his life from him, chooses that the best thing to do is to cruelly take the life away from the first pretty young thing he finds on board so that she can now dedicate her suddenly empty life to taking care of him. AND SHE DOES! What kind of patriarchal crap is that?!? Sure, her whole character seems to have been conveniently structured to play this role willingly (how perfect for our male lead) but what kind of message does this movie leave?!? It was once said that an author can ask the audience to make one impossible leap with them but no more. That was supposed to be belief in an amazing starship that makes interplanetary colonization possible but this movie asks us to make two impossible leaps beyond that. One is in a starship so perfect (and bizarre - it is a luxury liner or a colony ship?) that malfunctions are unheard of and yet it cannot figure out how to awaken a *single* staff member in case of some situation it cannot auto-handle. Even if you accept it was programed to avoid that option until all else failed it had two years to fail in fixing the situation and watching it slowly deteriorate and still would rather blow up than wake anyone. Maybe because for some reason it can do anything except put people back to sleep for some crazy reason but even that logic does not hold up when compared against utter destruction.The second leap, which I already referred to, was that this woman Aurora could fall so utterly head-over-heels in love with the man Jim who took all her hopes and dreams from her so he would not be lonely! Can you even imagine the violation that Aurora would have felt when she found out?!? Certainly, it never occurred to Jim who in all his time ""agonizing"" over whether or not to wake her apparently never asked himself the question about what she might say or feel if awakened! He therefore found himself *completely* without any kind if a plan or thought in his head about how to proceed after sabotaging her pod and goes with ""just let her assume it was an accident and ask the bro-bot to keep quiet about it"". Yet despite suffering this horrific betrayal all she needs is a little time to pout and a few good ol' fashioned action sequences and suddenly she doesn't give a damn about every other soul on that ship as long as she does not lose her true love who apparently now completes her. Even when she is handed the solution to rejoin the rest of the crew (why not wake up once a year for a few days to keep him company since the writers decided to only leave a ticket for one back to Homestead?) she could suddenly no longer imagine a life without this entitled macho prick.In short, I cannot recommend this. If you were only after a good sci-fi thriller then it is going to be wrecked for you by the massive plot holes and contrived scenarios. If you wanted a romance then it is going to be wrecked by the two-dimensional writing for the female lead who was apparently nothing more than a prize to be claimed and is unrecognizably complicit in discarding all her disgust and betrayal so that she can live out her feminine duty to love and nurture him despite her own plans for her own life that he stole from her.But, hey, great effects if that is enough for you."
" Loved it
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,9,"What was there not to like about this film? Great story line. Great actors and actress. Magnificent visuals. Deep subject matter. The bartender reminded me of the bartender in ""The Shining."" I hated when the movie came to an end, I could have watched it for hours. My 7 year- old granddaughter was thrilled by it, but had to cover her eyes during a couple of scenes."
" Shame on you bad reviewers
",2017-08-04 00:00:00,9,"I am so angry about the critics. I did not see the movie before, because of the bad critics. After 1 year i just got the chance to see it. After i saw the movie i reread some of the reviews(user and critics also). The bad critics based on following points: -This was not expected according to trailer (Mostly i do not see any trailer before seeing a movie, so?)-Not realistic about physics (I never thought that every reviewer a professional physic in real life. What about a sci-fi has it's own physics rules that differs from ours? Moreover who cares about physics in Star Wars movies? No one. However the space battles should have been done without any sound you know) -This is a romantic movie (No it isn't! This movie is a drama about loneliness and more with some romantic element. This movie could be awesome without any romance. However there would be much less sex scene. -Boring (Then you watch this movie from the wrong aspect. If you find this movie boring and you don't know why then imagine that you are alone in a spaceship. What would you do until end of your life?What i found in this movie are: Great acting, OK story (i would have done the ending differently), great atmosphere, awesome scenes. Extremely recommended for those, who like to think about moral questions."
" A space-travel tale!
",2017-08-04 00:00:00,8,"I was going to watch it, but not expecting it to be a masterpiece. It was not, yet surprised to be a lot better film when it comes to todays film overcrowded with space themes. The entire story takes place on a spaceship. It's a space journey tale, when the mankind with 5,000 on-board heading for a new home planet, but one of them unexpectedly wakes up from his hibernation pod. It's supposed to wake him and everybody a few months before their destination, so now he's up nearly a century early, and what he plans to do is what the adventures covered in the rest of the film.There's no connection to the 2008 film of the same name. Initially I thought it was like a live-action version of 'Wall-E'. Not entirely, only a few scenes and the main two characters remind Wall-E and Eva. It is also a limited cast film and I loved the simple screenplay, but strong enough to be one of the best in its kind. The actors were very good. The visuals were beautiful, a perfect film for the late night to watch alone peacefully.From the Norwegian director of 'Headhunters' fame. This is not his Hollywood debut, but previously he had got an Oscar nomination for the film 'The Imitation Game'. The concept was like 'The Blue Lagoon' or kind of the space version of the Eden Garden tale. I had predicted a few scenes, those were too simple to do that. The real big thing came in the later part, especially when all the focus shifts to more than the initial narration. Scientifically, not everything believable, but cinematically, anything can be possible. So with a such concept, the film headed to the conclusion where a twist came into play. Entertainment is guaranteed. One of the year's best that should not be missed. Recommended!8/10"
" Breathtaking visuals are not enough to entertain or to satisfy this viewer
",2017-08-02 00:00:00,5,"Breathtaking visuals are not enough to entertain or satisfy this viewer, watched on a 50 inch plasma monitor via bluray. Certainly the visuals would have been that much more impressive but I did not feel the story, slight as it was, provided the two attractive leads much to do.I would have expected any space travel to use the best automated systems available. Jim waking up to a crewless transport should not have come as a surprise to him. What is surprising is how he and Aurora should cope with the crisis or crises that threaten not only their existence, but also their 5,000 fellow passengers (whom we never see, other than those rows of hibernation pods.Much better storytelling with considerably lower budgets and better scripts are out there (eg. SILENT RUNNING).Thanks for reading, and keep watching the skies!"
" Great ship design, enjoyable flick
",2017-08-01 00:00:00,7,"I expected a bad movie but was surprised. The ship is well done, excellent production quality with nice effects. The pace moves along sufficiently to avoid boredom while providing enough contemplative moments.I enjoyed the lack of people. It provided a spacious atmosphere for the story to unfold. With any futuristic ""romance"" movie, there's always unlikely flaws related to technology and science, but for the most part it's not too bad, and certainly doesn't do worse than any other sci-fi movie.I get the feeling a lot of work was done on the design of the ship including the exterior and power generation. This deserves to be applauded, as the ship has a first class, highly evolved appearance. I really hope we humans build something like this in the future.I like it when a movie makes me think about the realistic potential of space travel and how it would work. This movie encourages such pondering, and on the whole is well done.Sure, there's plenty to question in terms of how likely this or that element is, but you can literally do that in any movie."

" Jennifer Lawrence made this movie
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,8,"The story in this movie isn't in any way unique but the movie is just very well made. I can't imagine what kind of pressure had been set to the casting for an obvious reason. There being only three actors in the whole movie they all needed to be great. No question, they were. For me Jennifer Lawrence is the one thing that makes this movie worth watching. Without she being so absolutely fabulous the actions of Chris Pratt's character just wouldn't have made any sense and the movie would have stayed just mediocre."
" Negative Hype Undeserved
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,8,"I just saw this movie after having heard various negative reviews swirling about. If you ask me, this movie was quite good. No, I am not a critic. Yes, there were several instances of implausible occurrences (i.e. Jennifer Lawrence's character functioning normally with an impaled arm). However, I thought the acting was generally good, and the set was just marvelous. Great premise, too."
" Great Acting Does Not Cure a Bad Script Not a 7 out of 10
",2017-07-27 00:00:00,5,First off let me say that I more disappointed by how users are over rating this movie than the movie itself. This is perfect example why we don't see new talent in movies. They know great actors can fool people into thinking they saw a good movie. I won't rehash how all the people who designed the ship and organize these interstellar colonization trips are idiots. Other reviews do that in a more entertaining way than I ever could. Jennifer Lawrence is great actress and her performance is the best part of this movie. Hopefully she get another Si-Fi movie gig that is better written. The visuals are beautiful but after watching the first hour I wanted to be over and predicted the ending. This movie is full of lazy plot devices. And without one of the most ridiculous ones I have ever heard of you don't even have a story here. Stop criticizing the critics who panned this movie they were trying to say you some money at the box office. Movie goers need to set the bar a little higher.
" This is an excellent movie, period !
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,8,"I always take the professional critic reviews with a grain of salt, because after all they get saturated with watching movies, and generally lose that natural magic feeling after a while...many of them definitely missed the mark on Passengers...A solid 8, that's what I gave Passengers. In the modern world of movie making, I have had a hard time finding one or two that really grab all the emotions...This is one of the best scifi movies I have seen recently. It possesses all the elements that make for excellent story telling, yet without all the space action the usual space epics have...in short, this is a love story, a well done science fiction story, a human condition story, and everything in between...all rolled into one extremely well told and entertaining narrative...One thing I noticed in some of the reviews, is the technical accuracy in the movie. By that I mean that much of the science implied is already being experimented with, so it isn't hard to relate to the movie from that perspective. But the story itself isn't really about science at all. It is totally about two people, and their lives on a star ship...No, I won't tell all the story, it needs to be seen to be appreciated completely. If you want fast paced movies, this is not it, but it does have a lot of fast action scenes woven in...and, some viewers will find the ending something of a let down. My housemate finally watched it, and she wanted more to the ending, heh heh...but even though it ends rather blandly, it is nonetheless very poignant...I am very glad they created this one...!!!"
" Passengers
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie. Saw at theater and it's on Starz, already watched 2 more times. If critics panned it, it's because they didn't get what the movie is really about. It is foremost a love story. I'm not one for mushy stuff, but in the end, that's what this is. It's about humans, what they would do to not be alone. What they would do to protect the one they love and a society yet to be. All around great movie. And it's got Chris Pratt!!!"
" Solid Space thriller with three major mistakes
",2017-07-24 00:00:00,7,"Spoilers below: Mistake #1: Only a complete moron, of which Lawrence's character wasn't, wouldn't know immediately that he woke her up.Mistake #2: When zero gravity happens, and she is swimming, she passes out and drowns. She would be finished at that point. Adding gravity, and the water dropping, would not bring her to the surface alive.Mistake #3: Instead of copying the movie ""The Martian"", the cord should have been long enough to reach him. The drama would be the resuscitation. No need to pull a stunt we all knew was coming, Why do the obvious? They should have surprised us, and made the cord long enough.Also, one suggestion: If I wrote this screenplay, their ""kids"" and ""grand-kids"" would have greeted the awakening passengers, because the two lead characters wanted a full life. That would have included children.I took a star off for each major error. Even with these dumb flaws, I recommend the movie. It is well shot, beautiful environment, and a good love story. The sets were so perfect you could just stare at this for two hours and enjoy where it takes you."
" A waste in space.
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,4,"Set aboard a massive ship on a interplanetary flight, Passengers may seem like a sci-fi movie but it's actually a chick flick; Guy gets girl, guy looses girl, guy gets girl back. Passengers crashes and burns on the contrived devices used to weave these familiar threads together. In terms of set design the movie is spectacular to behold, and but it's all a waste of space. We are looking at tens of millions of dollars of scenery in which to stage a ten cent romance. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence do all the things that couples do, share breakfast, go dancing, jogging, and eventually enjoy a fancy dinner dressed to the nines. Aside from one sexy spacewalking sequence, The setting doesn't make these events feel any more remarkable than they would have been on Earth. As we near the final act, the ship starts to fall apart. Lawrence Fishbourne is shoehorned in as a mere plot device. Scruffy bearded and with a hungover stare, he looks as if he has just come off the street. Passengers raises some intelligent questions about the human experience, but rather than answer them it chooses to focus on the lobotomized charm of star talent. You can hear this familiar Hollywood tune in your head as the actors goes through the motions of Nicholas Sparks material."
" Enjoyable
",2017-07-21 00:00:00,7,"I didn't have many expectations for Passengers. I was just looking for a nice movie to pass the time on a evening. I took a look at some reviews, and wasn't sure if it was worth watching it, but in the end, it came out a lot better than I thought! Okay, it's not flawless, and if you are looking for a convincing ""scientifically correct"" fiction you will get annoyed. Nevertheless, if you are in just to have a nice time and get some entertainment, Passengers is great material! It's fun , engaging and easy to watch."
" Must Watch!!!!!!!
",2017-07-20 00:00:00,10,"I won't give anything away in my review so no fear. I decided to watch this movie randomly because of the top billing of Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence, with that said I made a great choice. This movie wasn't just a love story, it was so much more. An absolute joy to watch and keep'd you in the film throughout the entirety of the film. Bringing undertones of Love, Joy, Anger and even truly moral and philosophical choices; it will be very hard for you not to enjoy. The critics who rated this low In my opinion should not be in the business. And in the time where Hollywood has typical story lines, characters and endings, this movie has none of that and has its own feel and flow. Go see this movie as soon as you can if you haven't already."

" Your worst nightmare: alone in space
",2017-07-20 00:00:00,10,"Passengers is an original story that leads us to reflect, whether on human relations, human existence or even technical and artificial progress. Finally, these are questions which correspond mainly to the psychological field and which do not have all the time an answer (this is precisely what makes them annoying and hard to bear)The duo Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt are doing pretty well. The characters they are playing are endearing. Forced to notice that one attaches immediately to the character of Jim, then to that of Aurora. At different stages of the film, I was surprised to ask myself ""what would have I done in his place?"" Some choices made by the characters may seem unfair to us but they are finally justified. Indeed, the human factor is not to be neglected and is often put forward; the characters (and actors) go from laughter to tears with perfect mastery.The sets are impressive and the special effects are very successful (I think about the scene where Aurora's swimming in the pool, when gravity ceases, water in weightlessness is remarkably realized)Passengers allows us to observe a future arousing our curiosity but which, as we discover it, also gives way to fear and anguish. The machines can prove as beneficial as they are harmful, and this is what Passengers wanted to stage. Fortunately, love always triumphs (at least in films)A very good movie, captivating from beginning to end."
" good
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,8,I watched this movie with a group of friends a few months ago and it was definitely better than i expected. It is hard to watch a movie set in the future without it being sort of cheesy but The Passengers was far from that. It puts a tiny piece of fear in the back of your mind because this could possibly happen one day.
" outer space love story
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,6,"This movie was really more of a love story than anything else, not a sci-fi thriller which is how the preview portrayed it. Jim is a passenger on a spaceship on the way to another planet that takes over 100 hundred years to get to. His body has been put asleep like all 5000 passengers. But he wakes up and is alone and for a year; he tries to get to the crew(behind solid doors) and tries to put his body back to sleep but none of that works. He only has a robot to talk too.So he starts reading biographies of people on board and sort of falls in love with Aurora. So he decides to wake her up even though it is like a death sentence. She doesn't know what he did, so they become a couple. Of course when she finds out he woke her up, she hates him. As time goes by, the ship has more malfunctions, due to a meteor hit. Eventually, someone else wakes up but he is very sick and not much help. But he tells them they have to fix the ship before it just explodes due to the malfunctions.So Jim risks his life to save the ship and Aurora forgives him. Other crew members wake up so their trip is saved.FINAL VERDICT: OK would have been better if more of a thriller. Worth a viewing."
" It's just that simple - Good movie
",2017-07-16 00:00:00,7,"Yes, you can do good sci-fi movies without having it all blown up and without any epic ""end of the world"" or ""where do we come from"" story. This one is no space action block buster, it's a well made and executed love story with a bit of action and a touch of philosophy.The key idea is pretty simple and the story straight forward. Although it's no master piece of course, i felt entertained and I simply liked it."
" Could Have Been Better
",2017-07-16 00:00:00,6,"Watched ""Passengers"" last night and well, I give it a 6 out of 10. The premise is easy enough and the visuals and the acting is spot on. However, the storyline lacks depth. Without give anything away, the story had the potential to really dig into our humanity, and the choices we make and why, but it wasn't to be. To be clear, the movie does make you think a little about love and what we would do for it, but dang if the director left me hanging with a ""huh?"" I was into the movie and you will be also...I am on the fence with this review...I can't give it my highest praise and will not bash it, but it's one of those movies that could have been amazing, if only the people in charge would have dug deeper into us."
" Cliché ridden film in a cliché ridden genre
",2017-07-14 00:00:00,3,"First off there is an entire genre of men (mostly white men)stuck alone in some place where they quietly go bananas. This one is only different in the chosen locale a space ship on a 120 year voyage. The first hour of this film checks off every cliché ever written in this genre. Including all the efforts to fix the situation. maybe different in details but the same in intent.Then comes this dread decision to bring someone else into this world of loneliness and twenty minutes of angst before a positive response comes by waking another person up. Followed by another near hour of another set of clichés before the only real action takes place.Don't get me wrong, the CGI is great and the spaceship is fantastic and they are really the only things that makes this dreary sad saga endurable.Don't get me wrong the acting is OK, and the visuals great but please try at least something more original next time"
" Good not great --- warning some spoilers ahead
",2017-07-14 00:00:00,7,"I love anything with Chris Pratt and I enjoy Jennifer Lawrence as well. But I took issue with a lot of the logic behind the movie. Maybe it's my analytical, logic driven side, but there's no way that the ship would have no crew awake to check on passengers and problems with the ship. Every machine has its kinks. It makes no sense that there would be no one awake to monitor the ship. The setting is in a time where people can be in a hibernation, comatose state for 120 years and yet it takes 19 years and $6,012 to send a message and 36 yeas to hear back. Maybe it's just me, but if you can look past all the logical errors the writers and directors missed out on, and enjoy a movie like a normal person, then it's a pretty decent movie. I don't wish I had the $8.59 back I paid to see the movie if that tells you anything."
" Better than some...
",2017-07-13 00:00:00,7,"I guess when you grew up with early sci-fi movies,the newer ones seem better regardless of the story line. The effects are great, instead of a few goofs, which are forgivable. Chris Pratt & Jennifer Lawrence do a yeoman job with a script that needed some more work. Their chemistry was great, and it showed in many of their scenes. Arthur the bartender almost steals the show with his smart-Alec one liners. I still felt there was a disconnect at the end when Jim and Aurora have to make a life changing decision, but it is left to imagination to figure it out. All in all, not a bad way to pass an afternoon."
" Two nagging questions for an otherwise enjoyable ride
",2017-07-13 00:00:00,8,"Good science fiction is never just about the technology, but how humans react to it, and this film presented what I felt were fascinating moral challenges met by both lead characters. But I have two nagging questions (POTENTIAL SPOILER)1. A ship with 5000 passengers and only ONE medical pod?2. At the end of the movie (nice to see Andy Garcia getting extra work) I would have expected to see kids, grand-kids, and potentially even great- grand-kids after 88 years."
" Just a good movie.. Barely.
",2017-07-11 00:00:00,7,"After thirteen months or waiting, horrible marketing techniques, and numerous issues within the film, Passengers ended up being a good movie in 2016 yet not the best movie of 2016. So with that I decided to give Passengers a ""Good"" on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10. With so much going for it, I felt like what I looked forward to the most about this film (the screenplay), ultimately turned out to be what I didn't enjoy the most about this film.Read more at theVade."
" One of the best SciFI films ever made!
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,10,"This will be a short review.I have been watching films since the Thirties. I have only 287 films I would rate as OUTSTANDING. This in number 288! The acting, story, and direction is truly outstanding. Even if your not a SCIFI individual you will still love this film. Pure entertainment!!!"
" Jen and Chris pay homage to Kubrick
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,8,"I admit that Morten Tyldum's ""Passengers"" isn't any sort of masterpiece, but it's nonetheless an impressive piece of work. Aside from the main plot, I liked the tributes to Stanley Kubrick's movies (setting in outer space, talking computers, the bar scenes, trying to chop through a door; just add a Beethoven soundtrack and you'd have a clean sweep).Like a number of movies, the movie warns us about over-reliance on technology, with lots of suspense to keep things going. Even so, I feel like the voyage that the spaceship makes would be a cool one (even if everyone's asleep for most of it). I wonder if we'll ever have commercial space travel.Anyway, it's an enjoyable movie."
" Hal Goes Ape!
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,6,"There is this titanic space ship carrying 5,000 hibernating passengers and crew on a 99-year journey from earth to a new planetary paradise. The nuclear-powered ship is run by a series of computers. Everyone is peacefully asleep, traveling through space at half the speed of light. So far, so good. Then -- well, think of it this way. Sometimes your computer develops idiopathic quirks and sometimes even crashes, doesn't it? Chris Pratt is waked up prematurely by a faulty chip or something, climbs out of his hibernation pod and finds himself all alone on a magnificently appointed but Listerianlly sterile space ship. Robots swirl around and serve him but the only robot he can speak to (and who can understand and reply) is the very human looking bartender, Arthur, who has the smooth, non-committal delivery of all good bartenders in first-class settings.Pratt, a mechanic, explores the ship but there's nothing he can do to get back to sleep, nor can he discover what went wrong and woke him up. A year of debauchery sensibly follows. When he's not playing basketball and working out, he's drunk in the Mexican cantina moaning for ""un autro cerveza."" Arthur sympathizes but after all he's just a robot with a fluid line of reassurance. Pratt winds up unkempt -- dressed in sweaty rags, bearded, and with long hair, he resembles Robinson Crusoe. Who can blame him? Arthur is the only other sentient being aboard and he certainly doesn't give a damn what Pratt looks like.Instead of shooting himself naked into outer space, Pratt learns how to wake up his fellow passenger, Jennifer Lawrence. It's a sound idea, except for the fact that now TWO of them will be stuck for 90 years aboard an otherwise empty vessel in space. Both will be dead long before the ship reaches its destination. What follows next is predictable. The romance has its ups and downs. The romance takes up about a third of the screen time and is followed by scenes in which the central computer, if there is one, goes ape. Frankly, some of the exposition lost me. The ""gravity center"" shuts down and everything floats into the air, and comes perilously close to drowning Lawrence. But inasmuch as the ship is spinning, centrifugal force should keep everyone's feet firmly planted anyway, shouldn't it? In any case, the last third of the movie raises the tempo to agitato with sirens going off, alarm bells ringing, instruments whose shivering needles are climbing towards the red zones, and all that sort of thing. Not to worry though. This ship is titanic but not THE ""Titanic."" The nuclear neurosis is only an excuse for an extravaganza of special effects.The direction is unspectacular and for that, I think, we can all be grateful. The cameraman wasn't drunk. The production values are impressive even if the result lacks any poetry whatever. Pratt bears about as much resemblance to Patrick Swayze as Lawrence does to Reneé Zellwigger. As an actor, Pratt himself is neither here nor there, but Lawrence, her crossed eyes, and the throaty squeak in her voice, are endearing. Also her bosom, of which the director deprives us of even a glimpse. No wonder the world is going to hell in a handbasket.I wish them well in their 60 or 70 years together. I hope their marriage doesn't turn into the hellish experiences my six or seven did. And I hope they practice safe sex and use condoms because, should Lawrence become preggers, they have no way of waking up the docs or even the midwife. And I hope boredom doesn't overwhelm them because, after all, Arthur is nothing more than a pair of metallic legs beneath his bartender's jacket."
" I just couldn't get past the ""stalking factor"" in this flick...........
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,4,"I SO wanted to enjoy this flick. Didn't happen. Once Pratt's character is ""destined to a life of loneliness"" due to some computer malfunction, I thought it got SUPER creepy when he was watching Lawrence's character in the sleep pod. Manipulating someone else's fate to adjust to YOUR agenda doesn't cut it for me in real life, and less so in flicks. Then he blatantly LIES about the situation to her. And he wonder WHY she gets super ticked off? GET A CLUE! You screwed up her life without any regard for anything but yourself. How could ""Aurora"" put any trust in this jerk? Other than that,"
" Enjoyable
",2017-07-08 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed this film and thought the actors/actress did a fantastic job. There were some strange technical problems, such as the ship flying close to a star and the multiple bypasses of the laws of gravity. I think the audience was intended to focus more on the characters' relationship rather than the flaws in the way the movie portrays space travel."
" A: Jim had to die! B: No spared equipment installed, really!?
",2017-07-08 00:00:00,4,"Just want to get it out there, because I'm amazed how few people even notice this apparently.Jim had to die at the end. Just had to! Otherwise, where is the morale, where is the substance, where is the 'food for thought' here?This, in turn, would place Aurora in the same situation Jim was - kill yourself/go mad from loneliness. And this would most likely make her to come up with the same decision she hated Jim so much for - wake up another passenger. But the studio decided to play safe once again. ""We cannot kill one of America's dearest! How would all the teenager girls react!?"" But I guess this is what comes with any high budget movie where even a slight risk in unacceptable. Overall, I've seen fan made sci-fi movies that are more believable and thought provoking than this gorgeous looking flick.This is my major issue with the movie. But, of course, there is a ton of 'technical' issues too. Which I was prepared to let slide, by the way, as I got used to a 'typical' Hollywood production. But this cheesiest happy-end made me furious about wasting my time on this movie. And since I made myself type, I might as well go whine about those 'minor' issues as well, which, in combination with the major one, made me give it a 4/10.Spared equipment. Is spared equipment not a common knowledge? I mean any equipment critical to an operation that is required to be continuous is installed in pairs. And a freaking control computer of a freaking reactor on a thousand million million million dollar spaceship only has spare parts in a freaking storage? Really?!! Shouldn't there be 2, 3, 20 control computers installed in-line? Shouldn't there be at least two reactor cores on this humongous ship? No??Poor old Capn. It's funny, but it looks to me that the whole engagement of the captain in the movie was done solely for the reason of killing him. Killing at least someone for the sake of gravity of the situation. - Hey, we need to kill at least someone. Since we cannot kill main characters, let's introduce one just so we can kill him. - How? - Doesn't matter, let's just figure something on the go. Oh and, let's make him black. And let him be someone significant on the ship, since he is going to be in the movie for just a few minutes because we have to plug him into the script somehow. - Errrm, captain maybe? - Sure, why not. By the way, Fishburne's character almost became the only one I could feel for, since I too hate the ""spawn and die"" mechanics in some games ;) But, I knew him for just like 2 minutes, so...VIP's pod. So you would think that ship captain's pod would be at least more fail safe than any of those 5k passengers and would be among the last ones to malfunction? Nope! He is important to the expedition, not to the movie.Med pod hibernation option. You would think that an engineer who has spent a year looking to get back into hibernation is going to check that second level menu of the only MEDICAL pod on the ship, right? This is the least troubling issue though, because I'm not sure override was needed to activate it. But it seems like override was needed just for all the revival procedures to be performed at once.This movie is not just a waste of time, but it also made me pretty mad."
" Small movie concept in a big movie budget
",2017-07-04 00:00:00,7,"Passengers is a movie with a very simple concept. A spaceship is on a journey that will take 120 years to reach its destination and all of its passengers and crew are in hibernation. Along the way two people wake up far too early and have to decide how to go on with their lives.When the movie sticks to this concept, it's very successful. It conveys the loneliness of being the only human(s) around at the moment, along with the knowledge that they will die prior to reaching their destination and won't make further human contact. Jennifer Lawrence and, even more-so, Christ Pratt convey the emotions their characters must be going through.It's the third act which knocks a few points off for me as the movie moves outside of the realm of character study and into slightly more sci-fi areas. The script at that point gets very generic, and is less character focused. fortunately, the movie does get back to point before the end."
" Potential not quite met
",2017-07-04 00:00:00,6,"When I saw the reviews of this film it was very mixed. User reviews seem to praise it a lot and critics the opposite. In truth the film is somewhere in between.The film starts with a colonisation ship being hit by a meteor shower causing disruption to some of the ship's functions some 90 years earlier than expected, including that of a certain life support pod containing Chris Pratt. We then how he comes to terms with being the sole person on the whole of the ship, including some of the moral choices about whether to deliberately wake up another passenger (Aurora - JL), even though this will mean their eventual death, for companionship. So far, so good.This is where the film starts to go off the rails a bit. Without successfully accessing any useful part of the ships controls JL (Aurora) and CP (Jim) develop a romantic connection... that is until Aurora discovers how she was awakened too early. It takes the awakening of Laurence Fishburne, as a member of the crew, to provide access to the ship's sensors to discover that the ship is ultimately doomed unless they can work together and bring the plot back into focus... MUST... FIX... SHIP... AND... GO... BACK... TO... DEEP... SLEEP.It's the second half of the film that leaves me wondering whether I enjoyed the film or not. It appears that wrongly waking a woman from hibernation for selfish reasons and then lying about it can be forgiven by placing yourself in a life-threatening situation. Quid pro quo anyone?I think I enjoyed it and it probably is worth watching once but I'm not sure I could watch it again."
" wonderful, atmospheric unique if a bit lacking in logic
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,9,"First of all, I would give it 10 stars just for the score. Wonderful soundtrack. Excellent cast,Chris Pratt's performance is A+ not a big fan of Lawrence's work in general but she was good enough here.Beautiful, funny yet poignant tale about loneliness and space travel. One of the best love stories I've seen recently AND DID I MENTION THE SOUNDTRACK? This movie is all about feeling, really unique. my only issue is with the ending, I liked it but I think it needed more elaboration and there was a major logic error in it as well."
" Pretty good space opera
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,7,"OK, full disclosure first. I love science fiction stuff. I grew up reading Heinlein and Asimov, among others. And now that CGI means that filmmakers don't have to put up with super-cheesy special effects, I love the spectacle that sci-fi movies can offer. The effects in ""Passengers"" were magnificent. Yes, there will always be quibbles about accuracy when it comes gravity, micro- and otherwise. There were some other plot holes, but what movie doesn't have those? Chris Pratt has come a long way from playing the doofus on ""Parks and Recreation"". He is adequate, but his story is a cautionary tale to any actor who considers giving up. Apparently anyone can get lucky and end up with a career as an action-film hero. Jennifer Lawrence was fine (and VERY fetching) and I do not understand all of the criticism of her acting on this film. I think she got the most out the material. The crux of the middle third of the movie is the ethical dilemma faced (and failed) by one of the characters, and this was proper for such an enormous decision.Overall, this film was enjoyable, but not destined to be a classic. Well worth a look, especially if you are a sci-fi movie fan."
" Excellent Fantasy Movie
",2017-07-02 00:00:00,8,"This movie is one of my favorites of all time and it is not for the reasons for all the hype.The actors are good as we all know, but I don't care for them...It is the same reason why I loved WALL-E. The technology was amazingly well done. As a student and a great lover of technology and all things robotic, I give this movie a 10 for that...Yes it is not all believable, but nobody can fault the fact that it looks pretty cool.The acting was good, yes...the story believable...meh, but let's be honest anyone could have played the part and my ratings still would not have changed."
" This voyage goes off course and shipwrecks
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,3,"NON-SPOILER SECTIONI want to give this film a higher rating, but the more I think about it the lower the score gets. Jennifer Lawrence as Aurora Lane is, not surprisingly, the bright spot, entertaining as always. The special effects are well done. The setup is intriguing: colonists on a 120 year flight to a new planet, two passengers (hence the title) wake up a tad too early (90 years too early!), and they discover something's wrong with the ship, and it's a race to fix it before everyone dies. How could Hollywood mess that up? Well, trust me, they do. In a science fiction film like this, there will be scientific inaccuracies and implausibilities, but that's forgivable. What's not forgivable are obvious and distracting plot inconsistencies and oversights and logical lapses that will occur to laymen like you and me during a first viewing, oversights and lapses that ultimately undermine my ability to suspend my disbelief. The characters offer some forced rationalizations to explain away some of the problems, but it feels more like someone realized late in production that there were major problems and attempted a band-aid or two. But more importantly, the film introduces a moral dilemma, a moral crime really, that could have a number of possible resolutions, yet takes the most insulting and unbelievable path to a 'happy ending' that I've seen in a long time. This could have been a profound journey that launched promisingly; but ultimately this movie founders.SPOILERSTwo main issues.The first main issue that undermined by suspension of disbelief was the lack of failsafe redundancy on this ship. The ship will be traveling for *120 years*, with no hope of any outside help, but the designers failed to have backup parts, plans, and procedures for the most critical components? After an asteroid collision, the computer starts to go haywire, but nothing about that awakens the crew? Seriously, the computer is not designed to awaken the crew if there is a fatal error that it cannot resolve? And really, no one ever foresaw a hibernation pod malfunction? There is no way to put someone back into hibernation if they wake up? Did all these people sign up for a potential suicide mission? If everyone is asleep and there is no chance of a hibernation malfunction, why exactly then is the crew locked away like Fort Knox? Why isn't there a backup reactor or two on the ship? And, of all things, the ship can't figure out there is a hull breach? A hull breach!? But perhaps the most grating of all: we find out there is only one Autodoc for a ship with over 5,000 people on board, with no backup parts or replacements! Seriously, these logical lapses occurred to me on a first viewing...I'd hate to see what else I missed during a second viewing. How did this film get past pre-production?The second, and even worse, issue is Chris Pratt's character Jim. I think we can all follow along as he wakes up early, freaks out at his predicament, and tries everything he can think of to find a solution, and after a year gets depressed. Got it, check. But then!....in true Hollywood fashion, he 'falls in love' with Aurora and wakes her up. Of course we are hit in the gut with the moral depravity of this action, we clench our stomach as he leads her along, and we all hold our breath for when she finds out the truth. But then we start thinking about how implausible this all is. First of all, if he can figure out how to wake someone up, why doesn't he wake up a fellow mechanic? Or engineer? Or doctor? It's the most obvious thing to do, but of course in Hollywood-land, he doesn't do that. Second, hello! Once Laurence Fishburne wakes up, the bridge is now open! You know, the bridge, *where the crew is hibernating*. Even though Fishburne dies, Jim could now wake up one or more of the crew to get help. Hello!?But let's talk about that ""romance."" I'm a lenient movie guy: I can play along with a lot of things. But *not* to the point that Aurora ends up truly loving this sick obsessive stalker who basically doomed her to a life of kidnapped isolation. Stop putting a happy face ending on this situation. The correct ending was for her to get back in the Autodoc and go back into hibernation. It was the only way for Jim to make up for his sin and salvage something from this shipwreck of a film."

" Ryanair Spaceships
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,3,"This one is really bad, It gets a 3 for Chris Pratt, who at least seems to be trying. So, it is set basically a number of years in the future and Ryanair has taken over space travel. A cheap ass space ship smacks into meteorites because ... reasons and a passenger wakes up. Only he cannot get to sleep or get any help. Going nuts, he wakes up the first attractive female he sees who is the most dependent female in the world and then they proceed to have a space romance in a dying decrepit Ryanair spaceship. He is a (lovable) idiot and she is an annoying dependent personality moron. Eventually the star-ship totally breaks and they decide to fix it themselves without any proper training. And they succeed! He almost dies but doesn't (WHAT A TWIST!) and they save Ryanair from thousands of dollars in reparations. This is a horrible movie for unintelligent people that dies.For the love of god some people should try harder when writing a script and definitely should not cast this gal for anything save romcoms."
" Great Movie
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed this movie. Never a boring moment, it kept me interested the whole time. Great story , good acting, amazing visuals. I was impressed by Lawrence's acting, I usually don't like her very much, but I have to say that she does a good job in this movie, even better then the male actor I can't remember his name now. Well done."
" High production values, great star power, problematic story
",2017-06-18 00:00:00,7,"The starship Avalon is in the middle of its long journey to a new colonizable planet, carrying thousands of sleeping passengers. But then something causes one of them to wake up decades ahead of his time and now he has to face the long solitude of space travel completely alone.Let's start with the good stuff. The film looks amazing, first of all. The sets are amazingly detailed, the CGI is some of the best seen to date and the whole film has a very pleasing look to it. Full marks for the production team. I also really appreciate some of the science shown in the scenes taking place outside the ship. They're small touches, mostly, but they're something you don't see in every scifi film and show that at least someone behind the scenes had a working knowledge of physics involved with space, zero-gravity and vacuum.The cast is also strong. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence are both rising stars in Hollywood, and for a reason. Both give good, credible performances and more than easily carry the weight of the film on their shoulders. I also really like Michael Sheen's small role in the film. At least half of the film's heart revolves around his charismatic performance.And then the problematic part. The plot in and on itself is serviceable. It's not great, but it's executed well enough to make it work beyond its initial limitations. The problem is Chris Pratt's character, who ends up making some truly questionable choices in the course of the film. Choices that look really bad, not just on paper, but in reality as well. Choices that I can easily see as deal breakers for some people. Personally I do think that the film handles those choices with the needed gravitas and doesn't sugarcoat them in any way, which saves the film for me, but I can totally see someone not being so forgiving.And that's Passengers. It's extremely well-made scifi adventure romance with some nasty undercurrents. Proceed with caution, but also with an open mind."
" Good enough
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,7,"The movie was okay , I mean the acting was great plus i love the actors anyway and they really played the part well. The problems each individual faced were good and very interesting but the problem in general is kind of really lame and how it was dealt with was also quite the same. If you read the description of the movie it'll be like you've watched the whole movie just not how each event went down but all in all it was an okay movie and the acting and personal issues the actors face is what bumps it up to a 7 ."
" Made for Misogynists
",2017-06-15 00:00:00,3,"Oh dear, a sci-fi film my wife might enjoy. And that just about sums it up! This is a 'heart warming' story about a man who selfishly selects and wakes up the prettiest hibernating female passenger on a 120 year journey to a space colony. Your response will differentiate on your gender type. If you are male then it will satisfy an adolescent daydream of being stranded on a desert island with a Sony PS12 and the most beautiful girl you've ever met. No competition from other males, Call of Duty 38 and endless appreciative sex. If you are female, and lean towards feminism, then this film will infuriate you. By waking her up he gives Lawrence's character to a life-sentence on a city-sized inter-stellar caravan rather than doing the honourable thing of drinking himself to death with the assistance of a compliant robot. Was there no access to virtualised 3D porn to fill the gaps between Tequila shots? My sympathies this time lie with the feminists.A smarter man would have realised he could put Lawrence 'back under' then 'dipped in' again and again on different female pods (say every 18 months) until he was no longer able to perform or care. Each woman would get a guilt-free 18 months of illicit sex with Chris Pratt then re-hibernate to continue the journey with no one the wiser. Now that's what I call a male and female fantasy!"
" Predictable. Unoriginal. Uninspiring. Cheesy. Bad Casting. One time watch.
",2017-06-15 00:00:00,5,"I gave this movie a try because while the critics gave it a harsh score, there seems to be quite a bit of positive user reviews - it currently has a 7/10 - well, the critics were right this time. I can't understand the positive reviews by the regular users... The movie is so predictable, cheesy, and dull. No real smart thrills or twists. Just plain point A to point B. It must be the kids of this generation that haven't seen many films enjoy this movie, while critics and avid movie watchers have seen this movie before. It's many ideas stolen from Wall-E (2008), Gravity (2013), Interstellar (2014), The Martian (2015)... but done on the IQ level of the movie Transformers; it seems like a grade school student wrote this film. The story is generic and uninspiring. The pacing is awful. It's just so cheesy and predictable (""Oh Mr Robot, please keep this a secret.... I'm positive you won't tell anyone but I feel like telling you anyway just to get some twists going"") - there is no shock value or real thrill to the film. The plot seems more like a short story TV episode where they dragged it out with pointless scenes like virtual dancing, basketball, and swimming. The movie probably would have worked as a 30 minute short film story, but it's dragged out to 2 hours of unexciting bad pacing fill-ins. I saw this film in 3D (being a big 3D fan), and you'd think even the most mundane scenes would still be more enjoyable because of the 3D advantage, but it wasn't. I know the movie ""Gravity"" actually has a pretty dull ""story"" as well, but at least the 3D for that film was spectacular and thrilling. The script was bad enough, but the casting is probably worse; Chris Patt and Jennifer Lawrence is like the most superficial horribly balanced combination ever. You just can't sympathize with them. There's also nothing romantic about with the chemistry/setup with the characters, especially from the script - both have done creepy actions. While Chris's action may be unforgivable, how could one fall in love with someone who goes complete psycho ape sh*t kicking your face and everything? It would have been more interesting to have Chris react differently towards the Bartender after the ""incident"", but a wasted opportunity yet again because the movie always likes to play it safe. This is one of those rental movies where watching it once is enough and is pretty forgettable."

",2017-06-13 00:00:00,10,"This is probably one of the best movies I have seen. It will remain in my memory for a long time. It has every ingredient of a perfect movie in the sci-fi genre, love story/romance and suspense thriller. The story is very unique and I have not seen anything like this before. Jennifer was so lovely and Chris was great too."
" A good space adventure
",2017-06-13 00:00:00,7,"On the Avalon spaceship, traveling to a new planet for 120 years, a passenger is awaken 90 years before time. After realizing there is nothing he can do to in terms of long term sleeping, he starts enjoying himself as the only awaken passenger, but loneliness will soon affect his thoughts, as well as an imminent ship failure.It's an interesting story with some incredible visuals, which simply amaze you with every occasion. The plot is quite linear and simplistic, thus predictable, but it does its job well in drawing the viewer into the surreal scenery.It's a pleasant watch and a good movie overall but nothing groundbreaking unfortunately, while the worst part of it is the fact that you don't get to care about the characters and their fate. I'm sure that it will catch many eyes with its visuals but the slow paced plot could have been a lot better."
" Fantastic
",2017-06-13 00:00:00,10,"For me, this was the perfect film, it was clever without being too complex, it was dramatic, it was stunning, a really well made film, I loved it so much it has become my favourite film of all time!!! And as you know there are some brilliant films out there, and for me this tops the lot, well done to everyone involved in making it."
" Better than expected
",2017-06-07 00:00:00,8,Surprisingly this science fiction movie without big battles or tonnes of special effects is engrossing.The premise is a bit hard to accept - that the planet would be so far away and people would give up all they know for something unknown via such a long journey. But once you accept the premise of this intergalactic journey to a colony planet it's quite interesting.Chris Pratt slightly overweight is likable enough. Jennifer Lawrence - yes her again is has a good on screen rapport with him. Michael Sheen is the robot.A little of their previous lives would have made things more poignant.Things worked out alright and the drama is quite moving when it needs to be.
" I really enjoyed watching
",2017-06-07 00:00:00,7,"An entertaining but somewhat sentimental romantic sci-fi drama about two people (Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt).There are plenty of sci-fi movies featuring in space but this one is different. There are no complications of wars between galaxies or superheroes in space. Instead, it's simply about a man and a woman bound by helplessness and hope.If you wanna see a fantasy love story movie in space, then you must watch this."
" A Movie I Loved plus a Lame Hollywood Ending
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,8,"This movie received some bad reviews because people were expecting a summer blockbuster and instead they got a quiet, character-driven piece of science fiction. Too often people think science fiction is all laser guns and space ship battles. But this is a story about people and what it means to be a human.What Passengers succeeded in doing was building two thoroughly real and flawed people and creating the movies tension through their interactions.To be fair to the critics, the ending of this movie was weak and uninspiring. Perhaps no one could see what made the first 90 minutes so original because the last 25 minutes were so drool."
" I read the synopsis...
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,5,"When I got to the end of the synopsis I realized I may have bought a DVD with a different and disappointing ending. Yes, I was disappointed with the story ending, and yes, the slingshot scene- rubbish (Watch the movie 2010.) especially with the vessel travelling at half the speed of light (do you know how fast that is?) The background should have been different too and the scene with the massive asteroid was a joke, obviously the science part of the movie was sadly lacking. But, for the vessel's centrifugal force- artificial gravity and design I give ten out of ten, very good. Story. 1-10. I write stuff like this and I do my research."
" A great addition to anyone's Sci-Fi library. Well done...
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,10,"A well written / acted / directed Sci-Fi movie. The story moves along well and has great characters.Although the cast is limited to a handful, it is smartly written to satisfy true futuristic space movie fans. Trekkie's, this is one for you.This movie is one for my ""Will watch it again, and soon"" lists. Just enough CGI effects to impress and not overwhelm the eyes. Kept me in my seat and interested in seeing the outcome throughout.I hand out a 10 rating based on entertainment value, which really, what this is all about. Enjoy."
" Avoid this film like a large pothole
",2017-06-03 00:00:00,3,"If you see this movie coming, run. It's a piece of junk with no suspense whatsoever. Everything that happens in the movie is 100% predictable. I sat there predicting in my mind every single thing that happened. Will he wake someone else up to avoid being alone. Will he wake up a guy or a good looking woman. I guess engineers who might have helped solve his problem were excluded from consideration. Gee, do we think he is going to have to go outside in order to fix something. Gee, do we think he's going to have trouble. Gee, will his pathetic little shield thingie keep him alive (temporarily) against an unsurprising near volcanic blast. Gee, do we think she'll have to go outside to try to save him. I will stop there in case someone wants to preserve some ""suspense"". By this point I was hoping they would both be blown off into space – permanently.The special effects are good, but it isn't like we haven't seen all of this before. Someone mentioned liking the pool scenes. Yep, they were cool, and the director certainly took every possible opportunity to show Jennifer Lawrence in her sexy swimsuit in the pool – whether they had anything to do with anything in the movie or not. My theory is that the glorified aquarium was in the movie solely as a vehicle to get Lawrence into something sexy.There are three things in the film which are even worth seeing: Jennifer Lawrence, the exterior shots of the ship, the pool. After those, change the station."
" Do not look only the negative reviews
",2017-05-25 00:00:00,9,"Let me point out the obvious:every movie review is subjective because it is based on the different tastes and experiences of the writer.So let me tell you that I loved this movie!Firstly I liked it because I like the science fiction genre, but it was not the only reason.Most importantly I totally disagree with the people who claim that its plot is superficial.In my opinion this movie poses some pivotal and I dare to say existential questions for everyone 's life.So I saw an allegory in the film.In my opinion the journey of the big ship Avalon is like the journey of life it self.In a way we are all passengers in the big journey of life.During this voyage we might have to make very difficult choices.We might also face hardships and handicaps.However we must make the best out of it because we never know when this voyage ends.No one can accomplish something like that if he/she does not have his/her soulmate in this journey.Maybe sometimes we have to try to live the moment but some other times we have to try to imagine how we want our life to be in some years and try to make choices,even hard ones,with this kind of criterion!Well,these were some of the thoughts and the existential questions that posed this movie to me.If it had the same effect to other people as well,I think that it fulfilled the aspirations of its creators..."
" Safe, Sacchrin, and Unsurprising Main Stream Movie
",2017-05-24 00:00:00,6,"There are No Surprises in this By the Numbers Romance in Space that is Made and Marketed for the Main Stream.Everything Looks as Great as expected for a $110million Budget. The Two Stars Pocketed a Payday for sure (Chris Pratt $12million and Jennifer Lawrence $20million). So You get a lot of Pretty.Suspense, Thrills, and Action...Not so much. Just the right amount to make it Profitable (from word of mouth and home video) and to Fill the Trailer.It's an OK but Unsubstantial Chick-Flick that is a Safe-Date. Much has been made about a certain Plot Point that Requires a Spoiler and if Thought About a Whole Bunch doesn't amount to a Whole Lot. But it's something that will Start Folks Sermonizing and Taking a Stand.Overall, Worth a Watch with Low Expectations and is the kind of Movie that is best Summed Up as a Missed Opportunity and one that takes a Voyage Well Mapped."
" A romance tale wrap in sci-fi cover.
",2017-05-23 00:00:00,5,"first off, if you are expecting a sci-fi movie, you should be disappointed, nearly every sci-fi aspect design fails, contradictions everywhere.second thing, the first 20 minutes just filled with boring and unnecessary footage.last thing, the story is so simply, with so few characters, it should be more than enough to express everything in 30 minutes."
" b movie
",2017-05-22 00:00:00,8,"A science fiction movie, Avalon spaceship on its way from earth to another planet with 5000 passengers on it, all of them want to start a new life on new planet. The time to reach there is 120 years, but before reaching their by 90 years passenger (Chris Pratt) awakes, alone for one year, he awakes another passengers (Jennifer Lawrence) because he felt love with her from first sight.The story was boring at the begging of the film, then it become interesting. Acting, both Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt did amazing job, their line, faces, emotions and moves where amazing. Directing was good, there were very good shooting scenes from perfect angels. The music fine. Nice visual effects."
" Love story in space
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,9,"Passengers falls in the category of movies,that you expected to see something else,BUT still like very much what you actually watched.The trailer is misleading,in the sense that you go watch the film,and it's totally different from what the trailer suggests the film is. 5000 people(sleeping in hibernation chambers) are in a spaceship heading for a distant colony.The trip will last 120 years but a malfunction in one of the chambers has Jim Preston(Chris Pratt)waking up after 30 years.He soon realizes what's going on and after a year living alone in the spaceship, decides deliberately to wake up Aurora Lane(Jennifer Lawrence),because he can't live alone anymore.Of course he doesn't tell her the truth, but pretends that she woke up because of a similar malfunction in her chamber. Won't tell you anymore, but the film is about the relationship that develops between those two.Pratt and Lawrence have a fine chemistry between them,and in the end they will probably be one of your favorite cinema couples(for me at least).The special effects are fine and the swimming pool scene where there is no gravity,is quite spectacular,but the film isn't about adventure or effects or action.It's a love story that you will like very much and that will make you want to watch the film again and again(I will definitely buy the Blu Ray). Overall Passengers is not an action movie,is not a sci-fi movie(at least in the usual version),it's a movie about a man and a woman who basically are alone in the universe,it's a movie about love.You will like it!!"
" Fascinating and worthwhile sci fi film
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,9,"This is a truly excellent science fiction film which does not have monsters, but instead tackles serious issues in a sensible manner. The film is set quite far in the future, when humans have already colonised a few other planets and starships are travelling across the Galaxy with humans spending a century or so in hibernation during the long interstellar voyages. (In this case, the starship passes the star Arcturus one third of the way on its journey.) The entire film is set in a particular starship owned by the Homestead Company on Earth, a horribly naff commercial enterprise which sends colonisers to its own commercially owned planets for settlement. There are 5000 colonists asleep on the ship, in addition to the crew who are also asleep, and the entire ship is on autopilot when it suffers a collision with a rocky body in space which damages it. Systems malfunctions begin to occur, and there is a single 'pod malfunction', whereby one of the colonists is awoken prematurely. He is played by Chris Pratt, who does a very good job of being an unambitious young engineer in search of a new life and adventure. He wanders around the gigantic starship and wonders why he is the only person awake, since the automatic announcement he received upon being awakened was that everyone was waking up now for the final months of their journey. The interior designs for the vast starship rooms are truly spectacular, as are the special effects of holograms of stewardesses, etc. Ghost of Stanley Kubrick, eat your heart out! If only 2001 could have been like this! I have never seen such magnificent art direction for a sci fi movie. The designer deserves an Oscar. A great many satirical touches are incorporated into the film, mocking the commercialism in a way which we can all appreciate and find amusing, and which will make many a travel agent blush (if travel agents have blood in their veins, that is). Pratt is horrified to discover that there has been a systems error and he is the only person awake on board the ship, which still has 90 years left to go of its voyage time. He spends a desultory year alone in the vast ship, becoming more and more depressed. There is no possibility of him putting himself back into hibernation, so he is irreversibly condemned to his lonely fate. As he wanders around looking at the faces of the other sleeping passengers, he is struck by the sight of a beautiful girl. He is tempted to wake her up for company, because he finds her irresistible, but he agonises over this for months, as it would mean condemning her to die on the ship, since neither he nor she could ever live long enough to survive to the end of the voyage. He has had one companion during all of this time, a robot bartender who looks human from the waist up and stands behind the bar pouring his whiskies and chatting to him amiably. This bartender robot is played absolutely brilliantly by Michael Sheen. His performance is in fact so amazing that it is the highlight of the film, surpassing even the spectacular sets in appeal. It is probably not an exaggeration to say that the man must be a genius. And one reason why he is so successful is that the script by Jon Spaihts is so superb that Sheen gets such wonderful lines that even a less talented actor could have scored with them. Finally, Pratt gives way to temptation and wakes the girl, who is played by Jennifer Lawrence. I must confess that I do not find Jennifer Lawrence at all beautiful, and I find that a problem in the story, since she is supposed to be so irresistible to Pratt. But then there is no accounting for taste. She does a good job of acting, so that she retains our interest for that reason. This unlikely and very ordinary couple then essentially are the story, until disasters begin to strike as the ship starts to deteriorate in a catastrophic manner. The attempts to save the ship and themselves preoccupy the young couple, and the events which ensue are extremely dramatic and harrowing. A crew member awakens because of another pod failure, but he only lives long enough to give Pratt his ID so that he can get into the command and control cabin. He then dies and the couple 'bury' him by ejecting him into space. At no point does this film become boring, despite the small cast. This is a thoroughly worthwhile sci fi film done on a grand scale in an intelligent fashion. It is extremely well done, and is a model of serious science fiction film-making."
" A Journey in Space
",2017-05-19 00:00:00,7,"On beginning the movie I thought I was in for a big bore with only two people on a ship to make the backbone of the movie. But the immersion is real. You get a bit of context, and an ambient score that really unsettles you and amazes you at the same time. You really feel lost in space.The acting is good, I just find the actors a little dull. I would be much more insane if I was to be alone and doomed. But overall what they did afterwards was convincing. After all, why wouldn't you profit instead of lamenting, even if that makes you a bad person (you'll see). Pratt and Lawrence make a beautiful couple, perhaps too beautiful it's almost too perfect, but hey he got to choose.What made me the most happy was the beautiful CGI. I love spacecrafts and space-themed sci-fi movies and they managed to make it look plausible and immersive with imaginary science elements in it. You grow worried when they show you the command center and the issues appearing. But once again I think the score made the film just much more polished than it would have been without it. Go and watch it, it's worth your time."
" Disappointment resulting of great expectations
",2017-05-17 00:00:00,7,"SPOILER-WARNING!!! When I first read of the movie Passengers, I was thrilled. Yet another exciting film about colonization and traveling to another planet. After seeing the trailer my hopes were up! I have quite a high standard for when it comes to sci-fi movies. Even if my favorite series as child was Star-Trek. The most desirable features in a movie for me are: a great plot that is carried all the way throughout the film, great characters, authenticity, attention to detail and hi-def quality. I have great respect for movies that have been recorded using high quality-cameras so that every move is captured thus creating more believable and beautiful-looking scenes by showing the whole movement-series. The more I find out that thought has been put to every single detail, the more pleased I become.To get to my point I have to start by saying that my favorite disappointments (interstellar, gravity) have a few things in common: they leave my questions unanswered, they make great promises, have huge build-ups and end up letting me down. Usually with and ending that isn't satisfying or For some reason seems to be different from rest of the film. And this one wasn't any different. Movie that could've been great. But didn't live up to it's possibilities and therefore didn't deliver, couldn't get to the finish-line. So why was I so frustrated? For numerous reasons, first one being that only a few of the big questions were answered. Too many questions were left unanswered: for example why didn't the man wake up any technicians? Why didn't the man try to do everything in his power to figure out why he woke up? (And if he did - the movie did a poor job explaining) Why didn't the girl go back to sleep? What happened when they got to their destination? How was life in the colony? The ending scene lasted approximately 10 seconds and left everything hanging. I was so disappointed that I wanted to scream. Why???? Why?? Why???So I'm left to ponder: did the time to process the film run out, did their money run out or were they just so insecure that they left a whole movie without a decent ending to please a crowd that thinks a movie which is longer than 2 hours isn't their idea of time and money well-spent?"
" Good movie with a lot of atmosphere
",2017-05-17 00:00:00,8,"Positive + Great performances from all actors. Chris Pratt in particular gives a very good and relatable performance. + Movie succeeds in conveying the feeling of being alone in space and allows the viewer imagine what he or she would do in that situation. + Movie succeeds in showing the struggle the main character is going through when being alone and when facing with his main ethical dilemma about the other passenger. + The movie successfully raising philosophical questions about the meaning of life, life expectancy, life goals and loneliness. + Very nice visuals and good depiction of what a futuristic spaceship interior might actually look like in real life.Negative - Plot is somewhat plain, but it serves the story of the movie and the points it wanted to make. - Not many action sequences, but perhaps that wasn't one of the main goals of the movie. - Andy Garcia's cameo was weird and unnecessary, especially because it happened near the end of the movie.Good movie with a lot of atmosphere that also manages to raise some interesting philosophical and ethical questions.4 Stars"
" Haunting and beautiful
",2017-05-16 00:00:00,8,"I have to admit that I had low expectations when I was going to see this movie. The negative reviews are why. Appearance that the film has gone bad, not earned enough, etc. But it does not make sense to listen to others. The best part is to find out yourself. And I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie well, even though I understand some of the criticisms. At the same time, I know that Morten Tyldum is an incredibly good director. One of the best Norwegian directors, without a doubt. I think it's strange that he made something directly bad. The film is not a featured sci fi movie, even if the action takes place on a spaceship. I enjoyed the movie for three reasons: 1) The story is unique, and something I've never seen before. It's always a good sign. 2) It's beautiful to watch, great movie, spectacular setups and scenes. It was impressive and 3) This movie works to switch between a love story and some action sequences. It seems like a thoughtful movie, and I appreciated the thought behind scenes and action. The few people we meet in the film give insight and one becomes familiar with the characters. It is also a strength, but perhaps also a weakness. The gallery is limited. But anyway, I recommend this and hope to see similar movies in the future."
" Great sci-fi movie - if you ignore the creepy premise of how they meet...
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,8,"Very good movie!Overall, the movie owes quite a bit to 2001: A Space Odyssey, which set the bar for the visual design of movies set in spaceships. And, oh what a spaceship. It's kind of the ultimate cruise ship, with bars, restaurants, a shopping mall, movie theater, infinity pool, and much much more. (Sign me up.)I can't say much about the plot without giving it away, but it provides an opportunity for Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Platt to fall in love, and for Platt to fix stuff. (Lawrence is a writer by trade, while Platt is a mechanic and is therefore the person to be the movie's hero. Just as it should be.)It's worth mentioning that the circumstances of how Lawrence and Platt's characters meet has generated some controversy, along with the moral implications of such a relationship.Platt and Lawrence are excellent, and Michael Sheen is wonderful as Arthur the robot bartender. (Wearing – seriously – the same exact outfit that Ted Lange wore on ""The Love Boat."")The bad news about the movie is the huge number of glaring plot holes. (Warning: Here be spoilers.) The plot is driven by a chance encounter with meteors. The Avalon spaceship is the most sophisticated creation in the universe, yet it can't avoid some meteors? Every one of the passengers and crew is hibernating, and as problems occur, there's no way for the ship's computer – or anyone on the ship – to awaken the crew members who might be able to fix the problems. Really? (HAL apparently wasn't available.)And then there's the little things: The ship is designed to entertain 5,300 people for four months but only has one bar and one bartender. Most cruise ships today hold about 3,000 people and have a dozen bars and dozens of bartenders. And, Jennifer Lawrence has an endless supply of casual and workout clothes and even cocktail dresses, but only one bathing suit.Bit o' trivia: Emma Clarke voices the ship's computer, while in real life, she's one of the voices on the London Underground who warns you to ""Mind the Gap.""See it now if you like sci-fi or the cast."
" Long way to go
",2017-05-13 00:00:00,8,"I heard the critics too. And I get that this is not for everyone. But I do believe that a rating that is currently around 7 (out of 10) is pretty accurate for this movie. It is good, it's not amazing or breath taking (excuse the pun), but it really is suspenseful and it does keep it real (if you buy into the whole notion that this space mission/travel thing is or will be possible in the first place of course).We do have some great actors involved in this, but you can imagine that there are moments in the movie where some may feel the movie could offer more. But that would not be keeping it real. Of course there are some decisions that are questionable at best, but that's life and that's how people work sometime ... Really good character piece surrounded by Science Fiction, but only watch it if you like human drama mixed with it!"
" This is more of a horro flick than it is a love story
",2017-05-12 00:00:00,1,Whatever happens after Chris Pratt wakes up Jennifer Lawrence does not change the fact that he made the selfish decision that her entire life would be spent on that ship. A total dick move IMO. He didn't know the ship was malfunctioning. His selfish decision ruined any kind of love story they were trying to portray. Terrible flick IMO.
" Greatly enjoyed this!
",2017-05-11 00:00:00,9,"I'll have to admit. I put off watching Passengers because of all the bad movie reviews by critics so much so that when I finally got around to watching it, my expectations were low. The movie exceeded all my expectations and then some. The pacing was excellent, the acting was great and the scenes were beautifully conceived and shot. All these were interspersed with thought-provoking questions along the way, challenging you to imagine what you would have done if you had been the person stranded on a journey that you know you could never see the end of. Greatly enjoyed this and highly recommend it if you are looking for something to watch. Ignore what the movie critics have to say about this movie!"
" A Beautiful Story Beautifully Told
",2017-05-11 00:00:00,10,"This is movie making at its finest as a story telling medium. It has an understandable plot without fluff content, and its all neatly packaged in under two hours. This was a blend of writing, directing and editing I assume coming from this non-expert.Jennifer Lawrence was magnificent. I still remember how her face and demeanor changed into horror when she learned that Pratt's character woke her up purposely, and later there was her joy as she brought him back to the living.A good date movie guys."
" Fantastic Sci-Fi
",2017-05-11 00:00:00,10,"Beautiful and romantic Sci-Fi movie with unusually interesting plot, wonderful space scenes and very good cast. Jennifer and Chris made a fantastic couple, Michael Sheen made an exquisite android. I really like Sci-Fi movies but there are so few of them worth watching. This one is a rare gem in the genre."
" Excellent Movie For Space Lover's
",2017-05-11 00:00:00,10,"I've seen lot's of space documentaries of NASA as well as ESA. The one thing I learned from those is ""The Jet Propulsion"" technology which will be used in future for spacecraft transit's. Along with them there is one more thing ""Hibernation Technology"" where humans are sealed on a spacecraft and will remain unconscious till a specific time. This movie is the best example of that."
" Definitely Worth Seeing
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,8,"I think it take really good actors to be able to carry a movie as basically the only people in it. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence do just that...really well.This might have been billed as a Sci-Fi as other reviewers have stated, but it is definitely romance, adventure and drama, with a little suspense thrown in.I saw this without reading any reviews and loved it straight away, so much so that I watched it again within a few days. It is one of those movies that can be watched over and over without becoming boring.When I read some of the critics reviews after watching it, I really thought they had the wrong movie. My recommendation is if you like romance movies you will like this one, it is that simple.8/10 for me and it could easily score higher, but I am being conservative."
" Really enjoyable - but careful what you tell the bartender
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,8,Well what do 'professional' critics know? It's up to you the individual to decide unless of course it's a genuine stinker - which you'd soon learn about. In my mind the film had charm - great effects - and a lot of feeling.I suppose one of the morals could be - don't tell your android bartender everything as it clearly didn't understand the instruction not to tell about the awakening. I guess its neural net hadn't learn't enough to really understand the full meaning and implications of what it heard and said.I didn't go and see it at the cinema - but bought the Blu-ray instead having read positive reviews from those who clearly enjoyed it.If you haven't seen it - at least rent it - there's no space battles with aliens but it's all the better for it.
" Not as good as I hoped for
",2017-05-07 00:00:00,6,"Passengers attempts to be the space version of Castaway, but comes up short.Sometime in the future, humans in hibernation are taking ship rides that last 120 years to far off colonies to start new lives. Stuff happens that awakens Jim (Pratt) way early in the trip. He faces a life alone where he most surely will die alone in space because everyone else is in hibernation. Pratt works hard to build up the desperation of his situation. They even have him grow a Tom Hanks-like beard. But the movie goes way too slowly with too many bar scenes. Other things happen and Jennifer Lawrence as Aurora Lane gets introduced into the story. Thank God you say because she adds the spice and sizzle that this movie advertised, which Pratt alone could not deliver.The Pratt/Lawrence cat and mouse game is the best part of this movie. Let's just say that they live a lifetime of emotions in the space of this movie. They face controversy, deceit, lies, plus life and death choices. In the end, the plot is just not strong enough to make this movie special. It's entertaining, good acting, but it just takes too long to get to the point, and moves too slowly. If I have to watch Lawrence go swimming one more time so we can see her body, I think I'll puke. Passengers is a decent film, with good acting, but lacks a strong story. You should buy a ticket, then set your expectations accordingly and you'll do OK. Enjoy."
" In Space, No One Can Hear You Vomit
",2017-05-05 00:00:00,3,"Passengers. It's a movie. About dating. In space.It reminded me of Red Planet, which isn't surprising, since it's the saddest excuse for science fiction that I've sat through since Red Planet.This movie wanted so badly to be ""Moon"", but ended up being a poorly scripted soap opera between two conventionally popular actors with no chemistry. It took itself seriously when it really shouldn't have. I like Red Planet slightly better for being self-aware enough to let Val Kilmer say ""Fuck this planet!"" and end with a Carrie Moss soliloquy about how she's going to spend some time with the space janitor. Either make a real piece of science fiction or be honest about the fact that you're making schlock.Pros1. Ship design was cool.2. Bartender was most likely a homage to a much better film (The Shining.)3. I have a new director to hate (Morten Tyldum.)Cons1. Chris Pratt.2. Jennifer Lawrence.3. The plot.4. Endless melodrama.5. Shameful use of Laurence Fishburne in a sad, 10 minute supporting role.6. Hideous credits music.7. Unlike Red Planet, it made money.If Chris Pratt, Jennifer Lawrence and Morten Tyldum each get hit by a flaming bus tomorrow, and die, I still will not believe in god."
" Must watch sci-fi/space movie!

" Creative, unique and captivating
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,8,"Passengers is a very entertaining film that should captivate its viewer from start to finish. Its novel approach, direction and acting makes it a memorable movie that could still be enjoyed in years in to come.Passengers is a well made futuristic film that takes place entirely in space. 5000 people are on a very long journey journey to another planet in a sophisticated spaceship. A malfunction results in Chris Pratt's character being awoken with 90 years left, his pod is the only one. After a year he cannot bear the loneliness and decides to wake up and stop the hibernation of the most beautiful girl he's seen and read about. I have never been a fan of romantic stories in film as often they are unrealistic, ridiculous and plain unnecessary. Rarely do they make a well paced and believable romance that adds value to the film as a whole. Passengers is one of these exceptions. Not only is it well paced, it is believable and realistic these two would start a romance. Things become very complicated when Jennifer Lawrence's character finds out that he purposely woke her up and they're the only two awake aboard.Passengers is more than a love story. It's unique nature and challenges are bound to keep viewers on their toes. This film delivers some great moments. As the ship gradually declines it becomes a great fight for survival in a complicated ship in the middle of space. We see chilling scenes when almost all is lost for all passengers. The two passengers put their lives at risk and sacrifice themselves to fix the space ship. Passengers exceeds expectations and is in many ways ahead of its time. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence give stellar performances in this space film. Sadly it was overlooked by critics and the Award ceremonies. Its quality has been downplayed even on this site which is a shame. It has similarities to the futuristic film, Gattaca, which was also unique, ahead of its time and overlooked. I feel in years viewers might discover this gem and give it the praise it deserves. It is definitely recommended."
" Bland Non-Adventure
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,4,"There were numerous viewings of trailers and TV spots for this movie that made itself out as a mystery, what is the cause of a passenger's hibernation to hatch early? Having no trust as what ridiculous Hollywood-style ending would make me groan, I voted down seeing it in the theatre. After seeing the rental DVD, I think the trailers and spots were deceptive as to what the movie was about. However, I may have been just dreaming up my own reaction to some flawed sci-fi films like ""Sunshine"", expecting the third act to be some extra-terrestrial mumbo jumbo, or like ""Sunshine"" some strange concoction of ghosts and monsters. Well, it is all just a romance flick with two hot Hollywood stars and a decent sized CGI budget. Somewhere a cross between ""Solaris"" and ""Wall-E"", the first act also has a strange semblance to Jack Nicholson going crazy in ""The Shining"", complete with an obliging bartender. Chris Pratt thankfully acts like a normal person who is stranded on this isolated spaceship in the middle of nowhere. The film kept my attention as it dazzled with nice space scenery and cool spaceship design. Once Jennifer Lawrence is brought into the mix, it is a little dull, as we watch them become romantic, in order to fulfill the target genre requirements. But it is all too mechanical, with zero chemistry between them. I was rooting for the talkative bartender to have some evil turn, but alas, he was stuck behind the bar. So no, this is not a thriller. I barely remember after the film was over that Laurence Fishburne makes a brief appearance. One might wonder if he was just a hallucination. There are, thankfully, brief moments of tension. But they are not allowed to become to frightening because, you know, romance. Which is too bad sinceMany spoilers ahead.The ship temporarily loses gravity while Lawrence is in a swimming pool. To her horror, she is unable to gain any traction to escape the large bubble of water and is trapped inside. This could have been a much more heart pounding scene that risked the life of Lawrence, but resolves itself rather tamely. And there is another tense scene.Pratt, trying to go back into hibernation, crawls inside the capsule, which seals him up. He soon realises that it isn't working, but now is trapped inside the capsule. Pratt begins to struggle to escape, with the tough machine staying shut. Pratt starts to struggle to breathe, and, oh he's OK folks. The same goes for the big reveal about the cause of Pratt's hibernation machine malfunctioning. It really is nothing beyond the opening sequence in which the spaceship encounters a large barrage of asteroids, damaging the self- diagnostics.And here again, the idea of a ghost in the machine, the gremlins that turn up with malfunctioning zoombas or whatever. These malfunctions could turn some of the artificial intelligence into rogues and lethal to our unwitting passengers.Ah, so much blockbuster material left off the storyboards because Romance. Except, suitably, when Lawrence finds out she was woken on purpose by Pratt. All romance is now broken off. With only a hint of redemption as Pratt performs a selfless deed. This film showed some mild science fiction elements. But with the potential for some weird space psychosis that could have worked it's way into the characters, instead all malfunctions are mild and infrequent. And Pratt ends up being too inert to create any tearjerker scenes at the end. So no thrills, a few chills, bland romance cut short, and a boring bartender. Thumbs down."
" Not a Simple Movie
",2017-05-03 00:00:00,8,"This movie goes beyond simple sci-fi + romance. It gets down into something that happens every day - if you go on a date and misrepresent yourself to such an extent that the other ends up marrying you, is that murder? It's 100% true - when you first meet a potential significant other, we all lie, we all embellish, we all try to make ourselves look better. This movie only took that which people do all the time to the extreme. But the question is the same - is it ethical to mislead another to mate with them? The answer is obvious, yet everybody does it."
" Okay-ish, but certainly not as bad as the critics made it.
",2017-05-03 00:00:00,6,"A lot of critics and audiences really did not care for this movie. To be honest, the film was highly watchable. Fantastic score, great acting and beautiful cinematography. The story in itself aspires to be something bigger than it actually is. Chris Pratt's character is woken up ninty years too early on a ship who's destination to another planet takes 100 years. To his horror, he finds out he is the only other person on the spaceship who is awake. He becomes so lonely after spending a year with no one else but a robot for company, that he decides, very reluctantly, to wake up Jennifer Lawrence's character, for good company. What he does is really quite horrible, but to be honest, can you blame him after spending so much time alone? Everyone complained that the film pussy-foots around this issue, but I thought it really does illustrate how bad Jim's actions were towards Aurora.Everything in this film is certainly on the surface, but it's a very cute surface. It reminded me of WALL-E a bit, not least because of beautiful score by Thomas Newman.6 out 10"
" Not perfect but still a thrill ride
",2017-05-03 00:00:00,10,It does have plot holes and at times it seems the writers took the easy way out. With that said the movie really invokes a great deal of deep thought. It will have you asking yourself new questions about your own morality and what would you do in their shoes. Overall a great movie. I was not let down by any part of it.
" It was OK but got worse as it went on
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,5,"It was OK. The first half reminded me of Moon and was pretty good. It really started running out of steam in the second half, and is basically a mash up of Moon, Interstellar and Gravity. The second half made little sense, a character was introduced that didn't really add anything to the film. It turned into a rubbish love story and Chris Pratt wasn't right in the role. It was alright I suppose but wouldn't watch it again."
" adventure of a life time
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,10,"one of the best films i have ever seen this is what we call a film , a complete film , full of emotions music drama action, there is no fake scenes or fake acting most scene are logical and based on true facts its a pure science fiction film based on real science like physics ,technology ,communication and psychology most of all what impressed me is the adventure of jim"
" A nice story but a predictable one
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,6,"The story of the Passengers revolves around a couple named Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence) and Jim Preston (Chris Pratt). Jim wakes up early on a star ship named as Avalon, which is heading towards an earth-like planet named as Homestead II. When he wakes up in the movie, due to some hibernation pod failure, there are still 90 years remaining for the ship to reach the planet. After spending a year alone on the ship with an android robot named as Arthur (Michael Sheen).The story is nice by a screenwriter who has wrote nice movies such as Prometheus and Doctor Strange, Jon Spaihts. However the story is very predictable and by the time it reaches end you would actually know, what would going to happen."
" Good Movie
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,8,"I found the movie to be relatable. I could see myself taking advantage of the entire ship if I was the only one around with no apparent consequences. His choice to awaken another passenger due to loneliness is understandable as someone who has gone backpacking for weeks at a time alone. However I was not impressed by the ending. If they sacrificed and alternated in the med pod they could have reached the planet and still be in their 50-60's. If they took time being together every third year they could still be in their 80's or 90's when they reached the planet. The other question to ask is why did they not have any kids. If they died, like it was assumed, then their children could have done the voice over about what their parents did. Another question is if technology was so advanced would people not live longer then their 80's?"
" 'You can't get so hung up on where you'd rather be, that you forget to make the most of where you are.'
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,8,"Writer Jon Spaihts (Prometheus, Doctor Strange, The Darkest Hour) wrote the story and script for this work to be directed by Morten Tyldum (The Imitation Game, Headhunters, Fallen Angels) and with the talent of Guy Hendrix Dyas as production designer and a massive crew in art direction PASSENGERS is a feast for the eyes – and a rather humanistic sci-fi love story.A mammoth company offers people the opportunity to leave the Earth and live on a new colony called Homestead Colony. They are being transported on a space vessel called the Starship Avalon. The journey takes 120 years so the travelers and crew are kept in hibernation chambers while the ship flies on its own and are to be awakened just before they arrive. And when one passenger Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) awakens, he quizzically explores the ship and sees he's the only one awake, he discovers he woke up 90 years early. The only talking being is Arthur (Martin Sheen) the robot bartender. He tries unsuccessfully to reenter his hibernation pod and spends the next year alone, wandering the ship.

Eventually he does and the two court and try to make the best of their time together. But then it dawns on them that something happened to the ship that made it wake Jim up. And they try to find out what it is. Further troubling is the awakening of one of the crew – Gus Mancuso (Lawrence Fishburne) who aids the in their trials. To say more would be a spoilerThe CGI effects are terrific, the story is more an honest love story than a sci-fi futuristic space adventure, but the film feels very long and soon the gorgeous visual effects become tiresome. Good performances from beautiful actors save the film."
" you should show this film.

Jennifer Lawrence stars as Aurora lain and Chris Pratt plays the role of Jim Preston. My favorite character is Jennifer Lawrence because she is very strong, honest , a passion and an emotion. I think this is an ideal film for people who like the adventure and romantic together. I give this film *****"
" Wasted opportunity
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,5,"Another wasted opportunity.While the movie is more than acceptable for the firsts 3/4, even very good I dare say, the ending is so full of nonsense, plot holes and inconsistencies you may end up very disappointed. 5 out of 10 takes in consideration the firsts 3/4 ... it could be below 4 just for the ending."
" best space film i have seen.
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,10,"Its a classic love story but based in space, there is love action and drama, its starts of slow but builds pace and is worth watching if your into sci fi films. when i saw the adverts for this film i i knew it was a must watch film for me. my wife also sat and enjoyed this film and she is not into space adventure films. i hope that they bring another film out like this.i would recommend watching this with out distraction, get a bucket of popcorn and enjoy this amazing movie. i don't know why this has got bad reviews but i also think each to there own. and i loved every minute of it."
" Fantastic acting saves plot with major holes in it.
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,7,"Contains Minor SpoilersJennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt both provide superb performances. Jennifer Lawrence ranges from playful to sexy to smart to fierce... all on cue and in perfect rhythm with the character's story-line. She presents a truly believable character who seems whole, like a real person who is alive.Chris Pratt's role, for the most part, requires a more subtle performance, which provides a solid foundation for his co-actor to build her performance on. He does get to show range when alone on the ship.The plot, sadly has many holes in it (and I don't mean holes caused by asteroids). Other reviews have pointed to examples where we are asked to suspend disbelief where it is impossible to do so. For me, it is the basic premise that is hard to believe. Would a ship on 120 year journey really not have any type of fail-safe for passengers who woke up early? Would there be absolutely no way to wake up a crew member? It would have been so easy to solve this by having the ""on call"" crew member killed by the same incident that woke up Chris Pratt's character. The acting make this worth watching."
" It was okay
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,6,"It was okay. The critics were a little harsh, but I give it a solid 6 out of 10. A man wrote it so it seems like the choices that were made were based on how men view the world. This is not a negative or positive criticism just an observation.The overall message of the movie resonated but it did not conquer new ground. Then not too many films break new ground so that's okay.The cinematography was great. The ship and it's perks and automation seemed plausible. If you're up for a movie that is entertaining and not boring or offensive then you could do worse.Break out the popcorn and relax and enjoy."
" Sci Fi too much of a given, but good romantic drama and suspense
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,8,"I am a sci fi fan, but But more on the Fantasy end of the spectrum. But this does require a lot of acceptance on the science advancement end. But as far as sci fi romance end, which is a pretty small group, I put it in the top 4 all time The big question among reviewers on this site, is why the bad reviews by the main critics? The answer is quite simple. You are putting in a formulaic sci fi plot,of early hibernation wake-up, plus equally formulaic ""we were thrown together"" love story. Then add in the hot actors and slick production and suspense, and you are reaching for a blockbuster. Critics don't like to be reached for. For me, however, its about well rounded characters, human motivation, and production quality, before I even want to go into the science end. This delivers all that, and does it by combining the plot values I mention above in a successful attempt to make something new. Lets face it folks, this isn't rocket science, or even star-ship science. Its entertainment on a high quality level on all fronts. Is it great? No. Is it very good? Heck yes. Very worth the watch. To me, the movies are about entertainment, and if you learn something, that's a bonus. But if you want your intelligence massaged, get out of the reviewing business, and leave the movies where they were meant to be. Which is the hands of the audience who wants solid entertainment."
" Why not make Babies?
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,3,"I just read 3 pages of 1* ratings which pointed out all the plot holes and how illogical it is. Fine, they are correct, but can't we just go with the flow on that and enjoy the love story? And the CGI? And looking at Jenifer Lawrence, which is one of my favorite things, and is the only reason I gave this flick a 3* rating.If we concentrate on the love story, shouldn't we be more demanding about plot holes in that? I mean, we're all going to die of old age if nothing else gets us first so we are controlled genetically to propagate the species. That's what love is all about. Read, THE SELFISH GENE by Richard Dawkins. With that in mind, I was looking closely at the final scene to see children and grandchildren, but it seems our stars never figured that out. They certainly never did during the meat of the film. (sorry about the choice of words... there wasn't any meat; just whipped cream). They must have pressed the 'gene override' button on the ship's computer."
" Loved it!
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,9,"I watched it now the third time and every time it's getting better and better. It has drama, it has space, it has SciFi and of course it has the love. All the needed ingredients to make you smile at the end of the movie.Put it all together it's a movie that will stay in the collection.P.S. If somebody wants to watch another good one watch ""A good year""."
" Great Loved it
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,Great . loved it. Nicely done sci-fi. not the fairy tail ending one would typically see out of the cheesy Hollywood machine. an added bonus it was not ruined with endless unrealistic fight sequences. Just the girl punching the guy in the face..awesome ! now that's realism I tell ya. the Starship was beautiful and very convincing.
" What could have been
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,3,"I saw this as a feature on a plane and due to a glitch in the entertainment system I missed the last half hour. Silly me had to see how it ended so I paid 4.99 to rent it from by cable TV provider. I want my 4.99 back. Pratt was okay other than being a creeper by figuring out which other passenger he wanted to bang. Lawrence was unlikable and useless, they could have put in any no name actress and saved a fortune, I highly doubt she drew anyone to see this semi trainwreck of a movie,certainly not on her looks. Sheen as a robot was outstanding yet somehow I think the robot had an agenda. Fishburn was great for the 5 minutes you see of him before he goes from fine to dead in about 2 hours (in movie time of course). His stated role on the ship should have been more impressive and it would have made his knowledge base credible. Yes it is science fiction but it doesn't mean it has to be stupid or presume the audience is stupid. It is as dumb as the Martian and really it is the same story. It also can dig into desperate situations without being so shallow and it can be visually great without doing the typical crap they do in almost all movies now is making the movie a vehicle for computer generated special affects which take next to no talent to create. They also cheaped-out in the ending, just as they could have redeemed themselves, everyone else wakes up and it is over. If it is free and there is nothing else to do, maybe waste some time and watch but don't waste a dime paying for this."
" Broken Vehicle for Attractive Stars
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,5,"Jennifer Lawrence appears sedated. The producers gave her some benzodiazepines. Jennifer Lawrence sedated seems less tasteless and annoying than Jennifer Lawrence when she is fully awake. Jennifer Lawrence is actually sexy, when she is sedated. Chris Pratt seems more like a movie star now, not the guy from 'Parks and Rec' who somehow ended up as an action star. Apparently, Chris Pratt can fix a broken spaceship. It is hilarious. There is some 'spacewalk tethering drama'. I couldn't believe it when they brought it back for The Martian, but they brought it back again. Overall, it delivers pretty well on the basic premise, but It falls back on clichés and technical plot elements that seem like afterthoughts."
" lil bit boring at the middle
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,6,"actually the plot of this movie is simple, but the director try to make it longer by added some love drama at the middle. at the beginning i feel curious, then boring at the middle because too much drama and lil bit thrilling at the end. this movie is not bad at all, just disappointed because i tought the whole movie will be thrilling from the trailer.."
" Impressive visuals. Good plot.
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,9,"As far as special effects go, they are high quality and I was impressed by the visuals. This movie entertained me from start to finish. As far as the plot goes, I think the story is believable. Chris Pratt does what literally anyone in his position would do. Overall, this is not a movie to miss as the special effects are very good and the story remains entertaining throughout."
" Amazing
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"Loved the original plot line, the chemistry between the characters, the jokes, the action, everything. Lawrence and Pratt did simply a marvelous job at portraying the characters as well. The people working in Rotten Tomatoes must've had sticks up their butt holes when watching this, hence the bad rating."
" A completely beautiful sci-fi love story
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,9,"Most of the critics on Rotten Tomatoes were not fresh in their reviews of this film. They were dead wrong on this one. It has a great story, beautiful cinematography, the most elegantly designed spacecraft I have seen in any sci-fi film and award worthy performances from the entire cast. The story was a bit formulaic but the formula worked in this film because of the way it was revealed."
" Passengers not quite first class
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,6,"Plot; During an interstellar flight to a new colony world, one of the ship's five thousand passengers is accidentally awakened early from sleep hibernation.Most of the criticism surrounding Passengers centers around taking it to task for what it isn't, or for not being all that it could have been, and ultimately I agree. Instead of focusing on the moral and ethical dilemma of the choice made by Chris Pratt's character and its consequences, or acting as an exploration of loneliness and the human need for companionship, it instead grafts those themes onto a boilerplate romance. Pratt and co-star Jennifer Lawrence lift the material with strong performances and good chemistry and help to make Passengers a reasonably entertaining sci-fi/romantic/drama, but I can't help but feel that hidden deep within is a much better film."
" Dylan Moran Quote
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,5,"Two young, fit, healthy, attractive people in love? There's nothing worse to look at in the world.Half way though I was hoping the ship would just blow up to get the movie over with. Or that someone would come and shoot me so I wouldn't have to watch it anymore.The heat shield part I guess was kinda interesting. Not to sound too pretentious but I feel bad for the people that worked on CGI and props, they obviously put in a lot of work and I can only assume most of the good stuff got ruined in the editing or is stored somewhere waiting to be released in a sequel.Lawrence Fishburne as ship captain and Martin Sheen as the bartender are the only performances worth watching."
" Great idea, substandard acting and mediocre plot
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,4,"A great idea for a sci-fi movie. The acting was second rate with a slow paced story line only leading to a disappointing ending. My expectations were that this movie would have more action and a story that would have you on the edge of your seat, however it was not the case. I still think the concept had a lot of potential but definitely a let down."
" Creative romantic plot
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,Wow! What an extremely creative angle to a romantic plot. Blue lagoon type castaway love story. These writers have great creative minds. This way I probably wouldn't even mind to be marooned with the love of my live.They could have spend somewhat more time on the great live these two seemed to have together before things went wrong. But going into those details would mean a spoiler. Have fun watching!
" The critics are pretentious rats
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,10,"This is an excellent movie. It isn't a 10/10 movie, but it's more like an 8 or 9. Great story, great acting, great looking CGI and environment. If you like SCI-FI movies you'll like this, I actually really want to see it again. I was amazed to see Rotten Tomatoes gave this 38% although Rotten Tomatoes tend to be out of touch most of the time which is why I come to IMDb for my reviews. As you can here have given it 7/10 on average. Gee, I wonder why that is Rotten Tomato reviewers, perhaps it's because you're all pretentious circlejerkers."
" Space dilemma
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,8,"Passengers isn't categorized in the science fiction genre and I wonder why because it's clearly a sci-fi. There is a bit of romance as well but the focal point is science fiction to me. The story is very easy to follow but also very pleasant. Even though there aren't much actors in about ninety percent of the movie you never get the feeling it's going to be boring. Chris Pratt that is normally not one of my favorite actors is doing a good job, as well as Jennifer Lawrence. The dilemma Chris Pratt has at one point makes you think if we would do the same thing to solve his problem. And I'm pretty sure almost everybody would do the same. The filming is wonderful and the scenes are very futuristic. All the kind of things I like in a good sci-fi."
" This extravagant science-fiction adventure strives for visual compulsion, but suffers from a blemished execution
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,6,"Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt are easily some of the most likable actors in the Hollywood roster, so placing these two together in a fun cinematic adventure wouldn't be a bad idea. But a duo of charismatic entities and a eye-feasting visual style only have the muscle to make of half the equation for this science- fiction adventure. This movie, which introduces a thought-provoking idea supplemented with themes of moral dilemmas, has a fair sense of potential shining through its cracks. But what happens when your concept is plagued by a problematic execution that involves places a huge twist in the arguably the most inconvenient time? In other words, that is my way of explaining how the ethical dilemma that was greatly obscured in the advertising. So in an effort to discuss the highs and lows of this science-fiction piece, this review will require me to discuss some aspects that may contain spoilers. Set in the near-future, this film is set on a spaceship known as the Starship Avalon which carries thousands of passengers each in a hibernation chamber on a 120-year voyage to another planet. When a malfunction in the ship causes Jim (played by Chris Pratt) to wake up from his hibernation chamber 90 years early, he finds himself stranded alone on the ship with no one to talk to but an humanoid bartender (played by Michael Sheen). He is later joined by a hot blondie named Aurora (played by Jennifer Lawrence) who's sleep chamber is also deactivated. Together, the two form a bond that is greatly interrupted when the ship begins to malfunction. The filmmaker behind this vehicle is Morten Tyldum, who last spawned the World War II thriller 'The Imitation Game'. This director proves to have a ingenuity in the visual department. The spaceship design is firmly original, and the visual effects which play a major role in the second half serve a nice treat for the eyes, while owing principles to entities like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Interstellar'. While the film not only sets stone to an intriguing premise but also feeds clear evidence that director Tyldum has strong ambition for thoughtful ideas, his way of handling the cerebral concept leads a lot to be questioned. The story kicks off on a friendly start with Chris Pratt exploring the ship while struggling to figure out the solution behind his dilemma. These first minutes are executed with great effort to establish the thought-provoking nature of his character. But it's not long before the film makes the fatal decision of taking the cat out of the bag and reveal a shocking twist that unravels an morally depraved nature of Chris Pratt's character before the story even reaches its halfway point. In return, when the revelation is discovered by Jennifer Lawrence, the result lacks impact and therefore kills the element of surprise. Although the story handles his morally dubious act is an sympathetic manner regardless of whether or not viewers will commiserate his actions, it sadly falls shallow of surprises, especially when it inexplicably tosses the idea out the window in the final act. On the bright side, the film has its exciting moments, Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence share a sweet chemistry as well as some humorous moments that lighten the weight of the morbid premise. Michael Sheen on the other hand, is given little to do other than provide a stoic portrayal of a humanoid bartender who shares a few clever conversations with Pratt.Passengers is flawed science-fiction extravaganza that spares some clever moments and thoughtful themes of morality, while undergoing a problematic execution. While there is no doubt Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt will the the major draw, the film stumbles in its potential to reel out a masterfully intriguing concept. Nonetheless, it can still make for a fun ride."
" Everything is great about this movie, but can't stop laughing...
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,10,"This movie is one of the best movies I've seen in a while.***spoiler alert***I know this sounds stupid but, I seriously can't help but imagine Arthur the bartender with that smile on his face going around the bar and cleaning up the glasses for 30 years for absolutely no one. Its sad but I also can't stop laughing :D"
" Enjoyable - BUT is it's science valid?
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,7,"I did enjoy the movie and the great eye candy of the two main stars. However, in light of 'equal opportunity' efforts now and in the future I do think that Jennifer's rear end should have been shown too. Also, I'm not sure about the movie's science being always being valid, for example: humans being able to be tethered outside the ship going half the speed of light, and not being fried while so close to the out of control reactor. Also, the much older awakened crewman seemed out of sync for his short useful life span at the final destination."
" Plot Twist!
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,5,"This movie was entertaining as to the psychological trauma that Chris Pratt has to go through.Overall though, how the movie plays out bores me and was not intuitive. They just inserted some characters to speed up the issues and finish the movie with a summary. The movie goes from ""what the hell is he going to do"" to a action thriller suspense movie.An alternate ending of this movie is the movie Pandorum (2009).Mind blown!"
" Enjoyable to watch
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,8,"I consider myself a discerning movie watcher. I enjoyed this movie. The script, writing, and acting are all very good. For the most part movies these days are nothing more than some variation of a previous movie. Passengers is a unique story.Jennifer Lawrence really excelled in her role and is gorgeous to boot. Tom Brady, I mean Chris Pratt, is great as well. Lawrence and Pratt had great chemistry. I can see how they had a relationship in real life."
" i just loved it!
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,8,"It's been a long time that i have given up on Hollywood blockbusters. Being more often than not very much the same, that is to say full to an unbearable extend of clichés, stereotypes, paper characters and arbitrary hence too predictable scripts, i find them too boring to watch in spite of their spectacular visual effects which i used to find impressive when i was a child but not anymore. This is the rule but as many rules this one too has its exceptions. Well, this rule does not apply to this film. What originally attracted my interest in the ""passengers"" was the beginning of the story: ""One out of five thousand hibernated passengers of a spaceship traveling to a far distant planet wakes up because of a system malfunction ninety years before the arrival to a new interstellar colony, doomed to live, age and die in the ship before it reaches its destination"". I found this idea very intriguing and though i have often in the past left in the lurch by interesting Hollywood script beginnings i decided to give this one a try. Well, i was not disappointed, not at all. Some clichés and stereotypes were of course there too, yet fully understandable given a mainstream adventure movie and not enough to prevent me from really enjoying the story -which was not just thrilling and intriguing, it was moving as well thanks to its combination of a survival drama and its very touching human feelings approach given the circumstances- from the beginning to its very end. Last but not least: Chris and Jeniffer - both beautiful and talented -in the leading roles is one of the film's assets."
" Good bones, bad plot.
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,2,"Just as others have mentioned, the trailer for Passengers leads you to believe that both Jennifer and Chris awaken at the same time and eventually fall in love. For the life of me, I don't understand why they didn't make the movie this way. Then, it could have at least been classified as a love story and somewhat decent. But the way it goes down, it seemed very selfish and disturbing and I had trouble finishing it after that. Imagine that Chris isn't as handsome or charming, or even better that Jennifer's character is engaged to someone who's already at the homestead or better yet on the ship still sleeping! Any kind of actual conflict would have made for a better, fuller movie, but what we're left with is a boring and misogynistic waste of 2 hours. It really is a shame as all the elements are there for what could have been an awesome movie, great actors, a seemingly hefty budget and an interesting idea. Only it falls flat, lending itself neither to romance nor science fiction. Very disappointing."
" Not an original moment
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,4,"This movie is about as boilerplate as you get with a whole extra heap of drama shoveled on thick. Oh there's also a wise old black man for advice and some dubious Newtonian physics.Need two more lines of text to submit this review. Well I think she would've been afraid of him when she learned the truth, I think if I were him I would've been afraid of her after she knew the truth. Then there's the food situation- there was enough food for 5000 passengers to live four months- but just the 2 of them if they lived 60 more years would've eaten ~10% of it. But let's say they had kids... and those kids had some little inbred babies of their own... they would've eaten at least most of the food. When the 5000 others woke up they would've all starved in a few weeks."
" It wasn't as bad as I expected. Breathtaking images.
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,7,"""We were woken too soon... Ninety years too soon. We have too go back to sleep. We Can't !"" At first, I just tried to ignore this movie and I was hoping I would come across it someday on some television channel during a quiet Saturday night. First of all because I'm not dying to see a movie with Jennifer Lawrence acting in it. Even if the antagonist is played by the charming Chris Pratt. And also because there were a lot of indications that this would be a typical romantic space story. I thought this would be the galactic version of ""Titanic"". Only that the spacecraft won't hit a banal iceberg and those two turtledoves won't be standing on the bow of the ship while embracing each other intimately with a cosmic wind rustles through their hair. Or maybe a modern version of ""Loveboat"" (only the dwarf dressed up in a futuristic garb is missing). All in all the romantic drool section wasn't such a big of a deal. And to my surprise it was more a visual SciFi spectacle than a love story about two remaining passengers spending the rest of their days on a luxurious spacecraft.To be honest, the first part was both fascinating and wonderfully humorous. The spaceship looked impressive. The first images of the huge dormitory where all pods are standing in which thousands of passengers are sleeping an artificial sleep, were mind blowing. They are on their way, along with a few hundred crew members, to a better place to found a new colony. When a comet storm throws a spanner in the works, it's Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) who first wakes up. Unfortunately for him it'll still take 90 years before they reach their final destination. That's the beginning of the more humorous part. Not high quality humor, but still good enough for a few chuckle moments. The way Jim spends his free time and his entertaining conversations with Arthur (Michael Sheen), a robotic bartender, provide some funny moments. And all this takes place in beautifully constructed sets and breathtaking interiors. One thing is certain, they spared no expense when designing this gigantic spaceship.Of course, gradually the excitement disappears and is replaced by a more profound atmosphere, wherein feelings of loneliness surface and doubts arise about the meaning of a further solitary existence. Time to provide Jim with a feminine counterbalance. That's when Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence) enters the scene. In terms of good looks, both of them belong together Tinder-wise. Them having beautiful children is written in the stars. Well, this is the beginning of the romantic chapter in which both start to scan each other meticulously and carefully, start to know each other better and finally in terms of intimacy are a perfect match. Despite my fear, the romance part remained fairly limited. The only thing I noticed is that Jennifer Lawrence hasn't only grown what acting concerns. Either there were some hormonal changes or there has been a medical intervention. Something I noticed immediately. However, her acting part was rather limited. It seemed as if they gave Jim the most sensual female toy from the entire crew. Of course an obligated pool scene had to be included I guess. Although, it looked extremely spectacular (and no I'm not talking about the feminine curves of J. Lawrence) due to a malfunctioning artificial gravity.And then it's time to start the action-packed part with also a short performance by Laurence Fishburne and some impressive CGI sequences. Sometimes it made me think of ""Gravity"" and ""The Martian"", but that didn't really bother me. You see, it's kind of a mixture of different genres. The most vulnerable part of the film is the limited cast (ultimately it's only Jim and Aurora you'll see). To be honest, nothing wrong can be said about their performances and indeed there's a chemistry between the two protagonists. The only thing I was disappointed about is the way the moral issue is swept under the table in a cheap and easy way. The moment this became a problematic and delicate subject, they increased the action and it disappeared into the background. What a shame because this moral issue was more interesting than the clichéd action section. Would he have done this to me, I would have kicked his ass into infinite space for sure. But despite this chapter full of moderate, predictable action and a romanticized ending, this movie appealed to me. I'm glad I didn't wait to see it on the small screen, but now I could enjoy its greatness in the cinema. And no, I'm not talking about J. Lawrence again!More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"
" Critics Are Correct
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,5,"Yeah, it's not a great movie. It's entertaining because you keep waiting for something to happen. It doesn't. The feelings are predictable. It's wildly unbelievable. The developing plot is not very complex. The only thing that makes it watchable is the high-profile cast; otherwise, it might even be a ""B"" film."
" Critics were right... this movie is crap
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,6,"The movie had potential but was awful. Nothing to do with acting, just the script/story. There were some small good things in the movie but over all it was just cheesy and awful. Not really a sci-fi movie. More like a current really crappy modern-esq version of titanic. Oh the ending was awful...there was an alternate ending as well and that was crap too.. Watch The Arrival instead."
" Long Flight, Bad Movie
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,6,"Pacing is way off on this visually impressive space ride that suffers from a dull script and low key performances from the major players. (Although, in fairness, one of them is playing a robot.) The premise is cool, about a lone castaway stranded within the confines of a spaceship heading to a new colony light years from earth, but we've seen the 'isolated castaway' done before and better in everything from 'The Shining' and 'Castaway' to the more recent 'Gravity and 'The Martian'. Jennifer Lawrence is wasted and Pratt proves he can carry a movie without falling back on his usual boyish charms; still there is little chemistry. Everything seems hurried and predictable. A major flaw that is difficult to overlook (and would have been easy to fix) makes it almost impossible to be sympathetic to Platt's character. (Suffice to say he's not really on the ship that long to justify the drastic choice he makes.) And whoever said ""there are no small roles just small actors"" was wrong. Sometimes there ARE just small roles. Just ask Andy Garcia."
" Pretty good if you just accept the many scientific goofs
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,8,"This is definitely one of the better SciFi movies, on several counts. Firstly, the CGI is spectacularly good even by today's high standards. I watched the movie on a (clear and sharp) inflight video screen and the effects were excellent: I must see it again on a big screen. Secondly, although there are a few wham bang scenes, they are thankfully few and far between: far too many movies now rely on destroying things in massive explosions rather than good plotting and dialogue. Thirdly - and most importantly, the script gives the audience something to think about: the ethical dilemma of Jim, the sole awakened passenger on an interstellar ship as he agonises whether to cut short the hibernation of the beautiful Aurora. He longs for company and, hopefully, ""company"" - Arthur the bartender isn't quite the same. Despite the scientific advisors the producers must have employed there are many goofs plainly visible (the ""Goofs"" section here brings up a large number) but IMO they don't spoil the movie to a great extent except towards the end. At about the halfway point the movie seems to stray away from thoughtful analysis of Jim's dilemma and comes close to being wham bang (See above.) One of the most notable scenes is where gravity disappears: it is a stunning mix of live action and CGI - and also one containing a large number of scientific goofs, not that this spoils the effect. The ending is, I think, the worst part of this movie. Hollywood likes a happy ending so, despite Jim's death in space (a pretty unequivocal passing, given the extent of his exposure to heat, radiation, anoxia and cryogenic temperatures!) he is miraculously resurrected in a truly biblical fashion. Shortly afterwards - in movie terms, if not relativistic - the film ends rather as if the editors had been given a deadline. A continuation of the more thoughtful first half would have had him die and stay dead: the final scene might have shown Aurora herself facing the same dilemma about waking a good looking guy to provide company - and ""company"". Fade to black/credits....... 8/10 but still a good watch."
" Great movie until
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,7,"I was totally into this movie from the actors to the special effects to the story. It really makes you think on what you would do if you were faced with a similar situation. The thing I didn't like and had me rolling my eyes and thinking about the disaster that ""Gravity"" was (spoiler alert)occurred at the end of the movie when certain person is drifting outside the space station (unsecured)in a spacesuit and certain other person goes outside in a spacesuit on a tether and manages to grab the other astronaut......I mean c'mon they are doing half the speed of light and yet they are out there drifting around.......totally absurd....the rest of it could be plausible but then they insult the whole story with the ending sequence.....oh well, such is Hollywood....still worth seeing for sure!"
" great movie
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,10,at first i thought it would Be just another sci movie but oh my god everything about it is amazing it makes you think about many things &the acting is super the chemistry is great it's not about aliens it's all about deep morals !!! go see that movie you'll learn from it & enjoy at the same time
" Excellent acting but some lackluster effects
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,7,"I knew little more about this movie than the fact that it starred two of the sexiest actors of today. Chris Pratt plays Jim Preston and Jennifer Lawrence plays Aurora Lane, both passengers aboard the Starship Avalon. The ship is on a 120-year voyage to planet Homestead II where it will deliver 5,000 passengers to cultivate a new world. These 5,000 passengers and 258 crew members are all in hibernation – that is, until Jim accidentally wakes up a few decades too early.I don't want to print any spoilers here, but I will say that the trailer for the movie led me to expect a slightly different storyline than what actually transpired. Perhaps it is because my brain has been imbued with so many space-themed movies lately, but I expected a more action-centred movie. Instead, the film was more focused on relationships, uncertainty towards the unknown, and the imperfections of the human psyche. What little adventure the movie included was saved for the end. I'm not even sure if it qualifies as the climax of the film or simply the denouement.Speaking of space-themed movies, I have to talk about the actual ship. Its design is unlike any concept I have seen before. It flies in a corkscrew fashion and includes a forcefield to combat space debris. The interior reminds me of a cross between the ships on Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and Wall-E. In a time where everyone and their brother is producing the same thing (i.e. space movies), an original theme for a spaceship is a breath of fresh air.Space scenes are very infrequent and frankly, slightly lackluster. To be fair, the visual effects team did a good job of representing a star up close (trust me, I've seen many stars up close) including prominences and flares, but the scene that included this celestial body had an air of ""we spent too much money on this visual effects team so we'd better get our money's worth"" and was a little too unbelievable for my taste.Now let's talk about the acting. As previously mentioned, Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence are two of the sexiest people in the public eye right now, and their acting did not disappoint. Pratt does a great job of articulating hopelessness. I have no idea what I would be thinking if I were in this character's shoes, but it's obvious Pratt put a lot of thought into Jim's motives. As for Jennifer Lawrence, her shining moments occurred in the hatred her character feels for Jim. Anger is not, for regular humans, an attractive emotion, and Lawrence does not shy away from the ugliness that goes along with it. There are numerous scenes in the film where veins bulged, spittle flew, and extremities shook, all giving the impression of intense animosity.The film ties up rather neatly, although it did take a bit of a turn I did not expect. The film is not extremely intricate, which works in its favour as there are not many ways a critic can pick it apart; he simply would not have enough information. Regardless of the potential for plot holes, Passengers is a pretty thrilling and thought-provoking movie that has a bit of everything for any audience member.This movie does not pass the Bechdel Test (however, keep in mind there are only three speaking roles, two of which being male).Read more of my reviews at mindovermoment.wordpress.com."
" A movie about the human condition
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,7,"This movie was surprisingly enjoyable. I didn't think it would amount to much considering it was to be based on two individuals who would never reach their destination. But, I was wrong.The focus of this movie was more a discussion about the human condition. How solitude affects us and how companionship can change how we perceive our situation as we live this journey of life. It wasn't boring at all, and anyone that likes space, and movies about psychological analysis will love this movie. Even if you don't, it's a fun movie to watch all together."
" Worth booking a pod
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,7,"Have you ever wondered what would happen if you were in cryogenic hibernation on a space ship on a 120-year trip to another planet and you woke up 90-years too early? Well this movie may have the answer.""Passengers"" has two appealing stars in Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence as Jim Preston and Aurora Lane (what a great name), plus pretty good special effects and an unusual story. The movie was a little lighter than I thought it would be. People have woken up on these kinds of trips before and it's usually not a good thing – remember what happened to Ripley and the crew of the Nostromo when they got an early wake-up call in ""Alien"".""Passengers"" manages to remain entertaining from beginning to end without the intrusion of any kind of mutant life form.My one reservation is actually with the costuming. Not all of it, just Jim Preston's outfit. A boring old shirt and pants? We could have expected something more futuristic than items that look like they were bought off the rack in the local menswear department. Aurora fares better with her podwear; it's understated, but looks a lot more timeless. Laurence Fishburne as Chief Mancuso nails it in a collarless jacket that would have passed muster on the bridge in any episode of ""Star Trek"" – amazing how epaulets look futuristic. The space ship Aurora has a nice sense of size with a huge bar that is a little reminiscent of the one in ""The Shining"" where Jack Nicholson was the solitary patron in the empty hotel. I must admit I do like my sci-fi films to lean towards the cerebral. I don't mind the odd death ray or a chest burster now and then, but I love the kind of sci-fi film that plays tricks with your head: ""Interstellar"", ""Contact"", ""Moon"" and of course the daddy of them all ""2001: A Spacy Odyssey"". Although ""Passengers"" has a touch of ""2001"" with two space travellers conversing with a master computer, it doesn't delve as deeply into the psyche as those other trips into inner and outer space. However it does raise ethical questions within the context of the story. ""Passengers"" may get a little predictable towards the end, but saves a surprise for the final scene; it's a voyage worth taking."
" Good and beautiful, but something is missing...
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,8,"After this movie i have got such a stun effect - as always happens with good ones. This film brought to me a lot different emotions, impressions, questions. Actors, decorations, story... I definitely had a good evening. But there is something missing, or there might be some sequel."
" Definition of Script Problems
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,4,"In all science fiction, suspension of disbelief is required to become engaged in the story. However, what the writers of Passengers fail to realize is that suspension of disbelief applies to technology, not human stupidity. The audience can overlook warp drive, ray guns, transporters, etc., but what can't be overlooked is a total lack of common sense in using this technology. There were many opportunities for interesting story lines, but Passengers attempts to patch plot holes that don't work instead of exploring concepts that do.The story centers around a star ship with 5000 passengers and over 200 crew members placed in hibernation for a 120 year trip to another star system to colonize another planet. This part of the story is plausible and even thought provoking. Even the ship itself is based on realistic designs. The science behind this background is sound. The ship is traveling at half the speed of light to a star system 60 light years away for a 120 year trip. Passengers are placed in hibernation to make the trip. So far all of this works and is interesting, but this is about a 5 minute background setting. After that things fall apart. Two passengers are accidentally awoken 90 years too early and face death from old age out in the void of space before reaching a destination. To make this plot work, the unbelievable is required. First, no one is watching the ship, not even automation. If this was a real ship, when an anomaly is detected the crew would be awoken to take care of the problem and put back into hibernation even if they do not take shifts over the century long trip. Second, there is no way to get a person back into hibernation in any way whatsoever. On a trip like this, that disbelief cannot be suspended, because it is too absurd to imagine. There are other things about this story that cannot be disbelieved, but the ones I have mentioned make this plot fall apart.One aspect that is interesting, but not properly explored is the reference to The Shining that dominates the movie. When this reference is first introduced the parallels to the insanity that develops from isolation or even possibly a haunted ship were obvious and the prospect exciting. However, the movie does not explore this and the reference is relegated to a running joke. Unfortunate.The setup of the plot has so many possibilities, but you will end this movie realizing that it is a classic example of a problem script that piles on the increasingly absurd and unbelievable in an attempt to cover the holes."
" Good love story bad hard core science fiction
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,8,"The advertisers for this movie made a terrible mistake. It is a good love story with a moral dilemma. It is not good hard science fiction and that is the crowd giving it awful reviews. People who like science fiction do not want love, they want plausible science. This movie was short on that. The explanations are haphazard and thrown together. The situations are just not hard science as in her rescue a la the Martian without the edge of that movie.On the other hand if you want a love story it asks the question if your personal happiness was going to damn your partner would you do it? That is original and that is who this movie is intended for. You really do not know what anyone will do until the end. My daughter who hates science fiction loved it. My husband who hated love stories hated it. I liked too. It is a good love story and that is the point."
" In The Cosmos With Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,9,"Even with Hollywood's decades-long infatuation with CGI, which has caused the cost of such films to escalate into the $100-200 million range, there are moments of levity when such visual effects are put to solid use in the service of a story and not to the salaries of the effects men generating them, nor even necessarily to what studios think the audience might want. During the second decade of the 21st century, we have had at least three films that fit such a bill: 2013's GRAVITY (with George Clooney and Sandra Bullock); 2014's INTERSTELLAR (with Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway); and 2015's THE MARTIAN (with Matt Damon). And in 2016, there was a fourth film to join this illustrious group: PASSENGERS, a combination of intergalactic romance and science fiction.The setting is aboard the starship Avalon, on a 120-year journey across the galaxy to a place called Homestead II, a new interstellar colony. The crew number 258, and the total number of civilian passengers five thousand—all of whom are in a deep state of hibernation, to be awakened within four months of reaching Homestead II, which Avalon is traveling to at half the speed of light. But something on the ship has gone haywire, and one of the hibernation pods has allowed a deep-space engineer (Chris Pratt) to awaken a mere thirty years into the journey, meaning that he will almost certainly die before anyone else awakens. In spending a full year in trying to find the cause of the hibernation malfunction, he also awakens a female journalist (Jennifer Lawrence); and they work at figuring out what has actually gone wrong. In the course of exploring the ship, and despite Lawrence's extreme rancor at Pratt having awakened her way too soon, they not only try to find a solution to an incredibly complex practical issue, but also find the chance to fall in love with whatever time they have left. A third person (Laurence Fishburne), a member of the crew (all of whom are still somehow in hibernation), assists them in finding the cause of Avalon's malfunction; and unfortunately it is actually hundreds of little problems morphing into one huge intergalactic nightmare.Morton Tyldum, a Norwegian director whose previous credits included the highly acclaimed 2014 World War II docudrama THE IMITATION GAME, manages to make what could have been a potentially sticky and sentimental deep space film, courtesy of screenwriter Joe Spaihts (who co-wrote the screenplay for director Ridley Scott's 2012 sci-fi/horror opus PROMETHEUS), into something far more substantial and thought-provoking than a lot of critics, and even some audiences, have given it credit for. Certainly Pratt and Lawrence make for an appealing pair; and the potential for them having passionate lovemaking is there at certain points of the film. In the end, though, the focus is on survival and the inherent dangers of both interstellar travel and technology that doesn't always work the way we might want it to. Much like both GRAVITY and INTERSTELLAR, PASSENGERS has a few distinct homages to director Stanley Kubrick's 1968 sci-fi masterpiece 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, as well as to Steven Spielberg's A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE and MINORITY REPORT, and the 2008 Disney film WALL-E. But just for good measure, in the early parts of the film, there is an android bartender named Arthur (Michael Sheen), who looks like a dead ringer for Lloyd, the supernatural bartender portrayed by Joe Turkel in Kubrick's 1980 horror classic THE SHINING; and even the expansive set of the lounge has the look (albeit in the height of high tech) of the Gold Room in that film.The scattered action sequences keep PASSENGERS from seeming too cerebral and slow (a criticism still lodged against ""2001"" by critics who really should know better), but the spacious production design and the CGI depictions of deep space keep the film from being a testosterone fest, and grounded in a certain amount of reality, again much like GRAVITY and INTERSTELLAR. Lawrence, known for her roles in the Hunger Games franchise and JOY, and Pratt, who starred in the 2015 box office smash JURASSIC WORLD, anchor the film's human element; and Newman, whose many scores include WALL-E and BRIDGE OF SPIES, among many others, provides a great music score of a very neo-futuristic kind. At a time when really good filmmaking that involves special effects work is hard to find, and total suspension of disbelief is all too easy to find, PASSENGERS illustrates just how well a certain sense of cosmic wonder, realism, and humanity can come off in 21st century Hollywood."

" A worthwhile movie for SF and romance fans alike
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,5,"If you're a SF fan, it's easy to see why some critics panned this.It's quite derivative (although what isn't?) with nods to Robinson Crusoe, Robinson Crusoe on Mars and a host of Star Trek Episodes. The first 3/4 is fine although as the plot gets wound up there are really far too many overly 'dramatic' moments which simply lurch from one how-they-gonna-get-out-of-this situation to another so after a few of these you know they will. Probably. Sorry, realistic plausibility doesn't come into it.So poor plot points apart, the movie is actually a romantic sort-of feel-good movie with some superb special effects - the zero gravity scene towards the end is brilliant! The actors are good (but if you're looking for Andy Garcia - blink and you'll miss him!) and the sets/CGI terrific.So although it's set in a SF universe, it's more about people and ain't that why we watch movies? It's not as good as the fans think it is but it's still a good movie and well worth watching for both SF and romantic drama fans both."
" An Epic Sci-fi Romance wronged by Critics
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,9,"On the surface Passengers was brutally slayed by critics calling it all sort of bad things but actually it's GREAT. I really don't understand , how critics ignored it. Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt , two of the biggest name in our industry right now comes together to serve this brilliant science fiction romantic drama. First of all , the very first thing that comes in my mind is the AMAZING Production design, it's some of the best I have seen in years for a sci-fi. As an Epic Romance based in space , it has the perfect story with a little amount of twist and suspense. It has it's own charisma and romantic factor plays well too without any loss in pace which too is smooth. The very best thing about the movie is both the leads portrays their character effortlessly and the fact that it is not exactly clichéd but has its own ground. Especially the last half hour is the best part of the movie. I don't know what the critics were looking for , it's a good entertaining film which does not deserves such low ratings. Thank god people who rate it on IMDb rated it double than what critics rated it which means they know what's good and what's bad. FINAL WORD IT'S GOOD , BOOO CRITICS."

" Romance?
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,5,"Romance? Stalking, kidnapping, attempted murder leavened with some romantic Stockholm Syndrome. Nice ship and a few effective exterior scenes. Otherwise essentially a silly business culminating in fancy FX footwork and a 'Perils of Pauline' resolution. ""Winter's Bone"" is still Jennifer Lawrence's high point for me and now that she has become a glamorpuss, deservedly, I keep wanting to fault her for being too pretty to be a good actress, but I can't. She hasn't proved it yet. Here, as usual, she delivers. Chris Pratt, on the other hand, has no weight, gravity or not. He delivers cotton candy. The tactic of casting 'pretty and popular' was only 50% successful.Notice how good Laurence Fishburne was? Imagine if it had been he that woke her up. Yeah, creepy, I know, but it would have been much deeper. And I would have cared, instead of wishing some 'eat 'em one by one' alien would've shown up."
" Jennifer looks amazing
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,3,"Jennifer Lawrence was stunning as always, the new IT girl in Hollywood. The premise for this movie based on the book, should have done better representing the book. Chris Pratt as the love interest in this story was horrible. There were too many holes in the technical aspect. As an actual mechanic, the scenes were shot all wrong. There is no way I would recommend this film to a friend, unless they just want to see Jennifer Lawrence looking sexy as hell!"
" A decent sci-fi rental that plays it too safe.
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,6,"I'm just going to list my takeaways from the movie in list format. Maybe it will be helpful to someone, maybe not. Pros - The production is immaculate. The cinematography, set design, CGI, all of it is top notch, as expected from a movie starring two of the most popular current actors. - Although I'm not crazy about Jennifer Lawrence, and I only really like Chris Pratt as Starlord, I will go ahead and list them as a pro, since they did a good job with these characters. Michael Sheen is also welcome in any movie. Cons - The science of the movie is a bit slinky at times, obviously to serve narrative motives. Other reviewers have detailed these inaccuracies, so I won't get into it, here. - The movie mostly leans toward a romantic drama vibe, and I personally think there should have been more of a sense of dread and danger throughout the movie, not just near the end. - Given the high profile status of the leads, the sex scenes are predictably tame and brief. Along with the lack of danger, the lack of eroticism is another way in which the movie plays it too safe. - The catharsis at the end that stems from the main moral dilemma (which I won't spoil) does not occur satisfactorily in my opinion. It didn't move me at all, and made it feel like it was never that important to begin with.In summary, this is an entertaining, but light sci-fi romance. It feels like a 70's sci-thriller that has been thoroughly processed for a general audience. It makes a good rental, but I couldn't help but lament that it wasn't the riskier, edgier film that it wanted to be."
" Nice love story in space
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,7,"Visually just stunning and good acting, but the content of the story was pretty standard romance-story: Guy does something wrong, lies about it to the girl, they fall in love, girl finds out the lie, they split up but come together in the final moments of the film.If this story was not on the spaceship, it would be same crap that you see in every romantic movie. But they are on spaceship that is dying and that environment rises this movie from 4 to 7.But overall the cliché counter is very high on this. A lot of last minute saves and coincidences."
" This is a good movie (Ignore the bad reviews)
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,8,"At first I was hesitant to watch this movie because of all the bad reviews I have read about it. As a picky/critical moviegoer myself, I didn't want to waste my time on bad shows or movies.I wanted to see for myself and confirm the bad reviews. So, even if I am not a Jennifer/Chris fan, I went out and saw the movie. To my surprise, I loved it!If you are into good story telling on self conflict, empathy, human nature, and some romance, then you would like or even love this movie.The only reason I could think of why it got so much bad reviews are probably: (1) when people think about ""Sci-Fi"" they expect to see high octane action, scientifically plausible concepts/ideas, etc.; -- It's called Science ""Fiction"" for a reason. A lot of ideas, physics, technologies in the movie are too convenient / ridiculous but are all forgivable in my opinion.(2) people expect the main characters of always doing the right thing (all the time). * SPOILER HERE * -- I expected Jim (Chris) to do the right thing when he was contemplating on waking up Aurora (Jen), and she'll eventually wake up on her own with a malfunction of some sort. So I was very disappointed when he did. But I realized as the movie progressed, that waking her made the story and eventually saved not just Aurora, but the rest of the crew and passengers.(3) they felt that the story did not fit the setting. -- They could have set this in a cruise ship in the sea, a bus on the road, or a group castaways stranded on an island, etc. For me, it does not matter what the setting is, as long as the gist of the story is told effectively.(4) they felt empty because at the ending they were already gone. * SPOILER HERE * -- This is how I felt somehow, I wanted them to be alive and live happily every after (as most stories do). But, realized that they did lived out their lives together and (probably) happy.- - - - I do have one criticism on the ending but it's more of a wishful thinking: * SPOILER HERE * Why didn't they bother waking up the crew and ask for help to go back to sleep? They do have Lawrence's access band. Possibly: They wanted to just live out their lives together on the ship and their search for adventure or new life has ended (?)"
" Cool looking ship
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,10,What! That is quite a support bill.This is much more serious Red Dwarf situation. I'm going to freak if I see a cat.I couldn't say I wouldn't do the same if I was in the same position I'm glad he left her to go through the same stages he did.Better than an infinity pool.Beware of chafing.Oh no... My stomach is turning...Nothing better than hangers in the future? Cereal storm! Unique circumstances can create otherwise unthinkable outcomes.
" Could have been better
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,6,"Passengers was good but not great. The potential was there, the film was trolling along it was equal parts funny, romantic, space travel and then they don't show the ending. Just a simple sentence. They could have at least done a montage of clips illustrating what happened to the characters. Instead the viewer gets nothing and are left wondering... Not satisfying imho. Both actors were great. Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt did amazing."
" Its actually quite good
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,9,At a total loss to see why this is getting slated. Its actually quite a good movie. Yes not a lot of action but action isn't everything. Awesome story line and pretty good acting. Well worth watching. I thought the ship was amazing and quite clever how it was filmed. deserves a better score.
" Went in skeptical ... and was pleasantly surprised.
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,8,"I selected Passengers at the nearby RedBox last afternoon on my lunch break while thinking: Oh well, maybe it's worth the two hours and the buck-sixty-one. The wife wanted a suspense movie after all the March Madness basketball. It was certainly worth the time investment and the nominal rental fee.To be honest, I wasn't expecting too much; was just anticipating an ultra-saccharine (to the point of goo-goo), explosion-filled, mindless violence, dumb-plotted space flick. I actually planned on snoozing halfway through it (had to get up early the next morning). Boy were we pleasantly surprised. However, I would have added these lines of dialogue between the main characters: A: Wow! So, this is it. This will be our life - just me and you on this spaceship - from now until our in-transit deaths. J: I promise to stay interesting for you. A: For another forty to fifty years? Don't put so much pressure on yourself.J: We can make this an epic, one of a kind, novel-worthy experience - for posterity. You'll become even more famous. A: Hard to cash those royalty checks with stiff fingers.OK, just my two cents. My suggested screenplay revisions always end up catching dust.As for the ending, well, yes, we could see it coming. That's where I knocked off a couple of stars. A great opportunity wanked.Disclosure: I'm not the biggest sci-fi fan, but I can truly appreciate a well-crafted, plausible, smart, sometime-in-the-future story ... and Passengers is one of them. I loved the lack of extraneous violence and unnecessary action scenes. It often felt very much like computer-controlled, automated, long-distance space travel would most likely feel: quiet with a lot of time to think ... maybe too much."
" A Misunderstood Personal Film
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,9,"The trailers for Passengers sold it as a disaster movie in space. Many people may have been disappointed to find out that was not the case. Not exactly. This was a thoughtful and emotional story about decisions made in absolute desperation that people have to live with for the rest of their lives. Let's get this out of the way first. This is a cool sci-fi movie. It has cool robots, a cool spaceship, it has an infinity edge swimming pool where you can backstroke yourself out into space. This movie knows how to apply potential technology with a little more inspiration than is typical of sci-fi films today. It invokes a sort of casual use and nonchalant attitude towards fabulous inventions that would astound us today, but are taken for granted in the minds of the characters. Production design is great on this one too. Fantastic wardrobe and costumes, the sets look real, and so so good. Practical effects are used when possible, special effects are used correctly, and look subtle enough to be real, but fantastic enough to have that ""magic"" appeal. Ultimately, this movie made me feel like I was on the spaceship with the passengers, due in large part to a well thought out and carefully planned aesthetic.There were a lot of mechanical, electronic, and destructive sounds in this movie, none of which sounded out of place. They were believable and made me feel more part of the world. Thomas Newman's score did not leave anything to be desired. I thought it was impressive how he managed a score for a movie with such varied tones, and was able to seamlessly and suddenly transition between them.The story for this movie was not complicated. Not overly so. However, the premise is a solid one, and also one that has not been explored on this scale before. Actually this movie deals in two scales; the very large scale of a massive interstellar luxury passenger ship, and the very small scale of a relationship between two people. And before that, just one man, slowly slipping into depression by himself, stranded like a man on a desert island. Albeit with robot servants and video games. The story may not be complex, but it is not dull, or ""flawed"" by any stretch of the imagination. The dialogue is well thought out, and feels authentic. Especially due to the stellar cast. No pun intended.Jennifer Lawrence breathes life to a character with passion, a woman willing to sacrifice everything for her work, a remarkable human being aiming to be a part of history. So this was nothing new for her. Nevertheless I am always captivated by her on screen, and feel like i'm seeing her for the first time, again. She always commits to her character and brings depth and personality to the screen.Chris Pratt has always been a favorite of mine, so maybe I am biased, but this film proves he is up there with the greats. That man can act. He has always done comedy from what I have seen (I still need to watch Zero Dark Thirty), but now I know he can deliver a nuanced performance of such human anguish that it tears your heart out before you're halfway through the film. He definitely should have got his first Oscar nomination for Passengers.Ultimately, this movie was a touching story about two people, with a tragic twist, in space. If that sounds like something you would like to see, you will like this movie, because it does it very well. If you want Star Trek with J-Law, look elsewhere."
" 6.5
",2017-04-04 00:00:00,7,"So I finally saw this movie after missing it in the theaters a few months back, and I'm a little disappointed.The concept's pretty good, but the plot just fell way too predictable and cheesy half way. They fall in love, OK he didn't even have to try much. But I guess if you wake up stranded with one other human being and he's Chris Pratt, why not. Aurora finds out and goes nuts, sure. A crew member wakes up for the sole purpose of giving them the keys to the operating room and dies immediately, wow that's lazy. Jim has to sacrifice himself to save the ship and he magically survives, oh come on even Disney doesn't do this anymore. Aurora forgives him and there's that magical resurrection, just spell cheesy. Jim figures out there is a way for Aurora to go back to hibernation but she chooses to live with him instead. Oh really, she forgives him for ""murder"" just like that?The visuals were good, and the acting was fine, but this is a film that should have had much more potential. I really liked the plot summary they wrote, 2 people stranded on a spaceship with their destiny pinned, but the way it developed was way too underwhelming."
" Great Movie!!!
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,8,This film tells an exceptional story that will surely keep you tied to your seat so you finish seeing the outcome of it.This one contains acceptable special effects and a small group of actors who handle their role well in history. This is the kind of film that leaves me thinking that I would in this case very entertaining and with a very good message for those who think that if they take away their lifestyle the world would end.
" Passengers is a okay movie.
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,5,"I saw Passengers yesterday by myself. It stars Chirs Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence who are two people that decided to leave earth for a new planet called Homestead 2.Firstly, I want to say that this movie is very beautifully shot, the special effects look amazing. For me one of the reasons why I can only say why this movie is okay is because of the characters. I thought both Jim (Pratt's character) and Aurora (Lawrence's character) are so bland. There is basically no backstory to Jim, he's just a guy who wakes up early and we get to see his journey in space alone until he decides to wake Aurora up and fall in love. However, there is some good backstory to Aurora, I thought she was way more interesting, we got to know a little bit better that she was a journalist and she wants to write a book. If they added that to Jim maybe the movie would have been a bit better."
" Gosh critics are idiots
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,10,"Every great movie, critics try to bring down. This movie is phenomenal and the chemistry between the two lead actors is phenomenal. It was full of passion, suspense, and 100% a futuristic science fiction. I would put this up there with ""The Martian"" no doubt. This is not rotten tomatoes so I really don't understand why critic reviews are even on this site. This should be for user reviews only."
" Drama aboard the Interstellar Love Boat
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,1,"If you're a sci-fi fan, you will be disappointed. There is nothing logical about this film. Nothing. They could have saved on production costs by using a more realistic setting appropriate for this self-absorbed couple, like the basement of his parent's house. Pure nonsense."
" A new genre?
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,9,"I gave this flick a 9 because nothing is perfect, but PASSENGERS comes close to perfecting a nice blend of character studies with fantastic visual effects and a subtext of classic Si/Fi. The characters are well drawn and this would make a wonderful love story in any other setting. Pratt and Lawrence are dynamite in and out of the sack and it's one of Lawrence's best performances. Kudos to the production team for using real future gadgets instead of CGI. A nice look into the electronic future."
" Fix the Script before you shoot
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,3,"This is a pretty rotten film. On the positive side, the special fx are very good and the cinematography is excellent. Chris Pratt gives a very good performance, but someone needs to tell Jennifer Lawrence that she is not Betty Davis. She is a fine actress probably better than Chris Pratt, but Chris seems to know his limits; Jennifer is so over the top, she is completely unbelievable. But the script...who in the world read this and said, ""This is compelling.""? From the first 5 minutes of the movie, you know the rest of the film. You are constantly saying, could we just fast forward through the next 10 minutes. I'm thinking, I've seen this movie so many times that there is going to be a massive twist at the end. No...what you thought 5 minutes into the film is exactly how it ends. This is from the Director of The Imitation Game, which is an excellent film. This is what happens when you sell your soul."
" Thank heavens, a competent sound editor, and zero aliens or mutants
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,8,"At last in this genre, a film that ISN'T 90 minutes of inaudible dialogue coupled with wall reverberating scores/sound effects and continuously under-lit scenes purporting to be atmospheric.This is a well written and acted love story set in a beautiful space backdrop. The egocentric protagonists are in peril from a hostile environment--not otherworldly life forms--in a plausible and linear plot. There are the usual deus ex machina moments, and it's a bit frenetic building to the climax, but science fiction is a welcome relief from decades of science fantasy."
" Must See SCI-FI Romance Story
",2017-03-31 00:00:00,7,Very mixed reviews depending on what you were looking for. I will confess I saw it late but was definitely worth seeing. I wouldn't have mind seeing it earlier for full price (which is how I rate movies). Several cameos by high profile actors but didn't expect big roles from most. Pratt and Lawrence really showed their diversity and acting abilities.Wouldn't call it a chick-flick but I really enjoyed as a husband/father watching it with wife & daughter!
" Loved it. Hard science fiction, slow pace at the beginning lets you connect to the characters
",2017-03-31 00:00:00,8,"The movie shows two passengers dealing with their situation of waking up too early from hibernation on a 120-year flight. As other reviewers said, it's not a Star Trek style roller coaster with tons of special effects, dozens of forgettable characters and absurd antagonists. It's a mix of a love story between two unfortunate passengers of a malfunctioning ship, and a realistic and plausible science fiction action in the second part, maybe a little too fast paced.Acting: it's good, which is emphasized by lack of other characters - there are basically just 2 characters that fill this movie with life. I guess there could be better picks for both actors but they did good.Visual: I loved the design of the ship and the 3D effects. In the 2nd part there's plenty of action scenes. It's a big budget blockbuster without the shaky camera and absurd monsters - what more could you want?Story: The first part shows human coping with a difficult situation. Second part provides an explanation to the malfunctions of the ship, some action scenes and a closure. This part is a bit rushed and over the top, so you lose some of the sense of realism you got in the first part.Overall 8/10"
" Outstanding journey. Visually superb.
",2017-03-31 00:00:00,9,"While on a 120-year journey on the spacecraft Avalon, a computer glitch interrupts the hibernation of mechanic Jim Preston (Chris Pratt). Over 5,200 passengers and crew are on board, but Preston's sleep chamber has opened 90 years early of destination Homestead Colony. After a year of disturbing loneliness, he manages to wake up another passenger; a very attractive female journalist Aurora Dunn (Jennifer Lawrence).A fantastic story involving two characters easy to really care about. Super special effects inside and out of the Avalon. Technology is mind boggling and romance is personified; in this situation, who could not fall in love with Miss Lawrence. Michael Sheen is almost scene stealing as bartender Arthur. Also featured are Laurence Fishburne, Kara Flowers, Vince Foster and Andy Garcia.Malfunction causing drama and trapped in space peril is combined with adventure and romance coupled together with a comfortable soundtrack featuring Bob Dylan, Bobby Darin, Al Hammerman, April Stephens, Imagine Dragons and Elvis Presley. PASSENGERS lives up to the hype and is rated PG-13."
" What's Not to Like?
",2017-03-30 00:00:00,7,"This movie had everything for me! Romance, sci-fi, action, great special affects, excellent acting, a unique story/plot and a great message. The ship(setting) was beautifully and believably futuristic. The first part of the movie gave me no indication at all in which direction it was going to take, except that we knew something was wrong with the ship.It kept me interested and guessing. Then a bit of a romantic story was introduced. The plot and pacing was done well enough for me to care about the characters and their future. The special affects (especially the swimming pool scene, when gravity was lost) was absolutely fantastic and unique. The score could of been better, but it was adequate and appropriate. The last half hour of the show was pretty action packed. I loved the idea of how it ended but would of rather had a little more time reviewing and seeing how their lives were lived as the message of the story was voiced over. (instead of JUST a scene of the tree growth and changes on the deck)but overall I can live with how they ended it. A really good movie that almost anyone can watch and enjoy."
" Lame
",2017-03-30 00:00:00,3,"This movie struggled from the start, and then fell apart. My rating just kept going down as I watched, like the tip of a bad waiter. By the end of it all I felt like I had been trapped in space with two not so interesting people for 90 years. A less than inspired love story, with little to capture imagination or heart. This movie is riddled with logical errors, convenient plot twists and technology, with contrived and unbelievable perils. This film is in every way a failure in writing, casting, production, and science."
" Boring movie
",2017-03-30 00:00:00,3,"Having read some of the glowing reviews from other viewers I may have to watch it again and make sure it was the same movie. It was so boring I fell asleep once and found myself fast forwarding through a number of spots. I like the cast but it is poorly written and directed. I guess this is a either love it or hate it movie. On second thought, I will not watch it again."
" Should've won Best Picture at the Oscars
",2017-03-30 00:00:00,10,"Can't believe it wasn't even nominated for best picture. sigh....keeping it simple and straight forward.This movie has everything. the right and equal amount of the genres. Adventure, Drama, Romance, Sci-fi and Comedy!(some funnies). Most movies has one genre that would stand out from all the other ""sub- genres"" but it's impossible to choose just one with this movie. but I guess it comes down to preference. this movie is a must watch."
" Great for a dinner with the mate
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,9,"I enjoyed the movie very well, it was awesome to see two beautiful creatures acting with such a chemistry on the film, both Jennifer & Chris did a geat job, I was only expecting more in the end, it seemed to me that they could have shown how they lived during those years alone, with videos, pictures or even why they dindt had a child! LOL"
" Terrific fun - solid entertainment - see it on the big screen!
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,10,"This movie delivered much more than I expected. It was satisfying all round entertainment, and one very tame, simulated (suggested) sex scene notwithstanding, a great movie for the whole family (well, > 10 years?). The acting was solid, and in the case of Ms Lawrence, more than competent. The story was interesting, and delivered a couple of surprises along the way. The pseudo technology was better than good, and the special effects were quite entertaining and ""realistic"". All in all, I gave this movie a ten, not because it can compete with 2001, or Alien, or other blockbuster game-changing movies in this genre, but because it delivered 120 minutes of really great entertainment. I definitely got my money's worth. I will even watch it again when it comes out on DVD. And (this is not a spoiler) stick around for some stellar eye candy when the credits roll along at the end of the movie. I'm usually the first out the door but I hung tough and didn't regret it."
" Chick flick in space
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,4,"Awful. Standard chickflick story. Huge anticlimax when mystery is solved. And just completely chock full of bs. Writer obviously never cracked a science textbook. Physics don't work like that. Electricity doesn't work like that. Computers don't work like that. Plasma doesn't work like that. Plants don't work like that. Stars don't work like that. A zillion wtfs fora lame mystery. Oh, and plenty of 'saw that coming'. Cliché soup."
" Too hyped up
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,6,"This movie is only worth the time if you like Chris Pratt, which I do. He saved this movie. Jennifer doesn't stand up well in this movie where as Chris's heart and soul is seen in every shot. The visuals are stunning, the plot also not bad, the actual story line could have been better. It didn't have any in depth characters other than Chris. I'm glad I rented it and I'm glad I watched it at home."
" Glad I didn't listen to the critics!
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,9,"I have apparently reached a point where I disagree with all of the critic reviews on most movies. I am glad I rented this movie despite what the critics said because it was actually a good movie. It held my attention all the way throughout and it ended very well, unlike all of the other space movies in recent years. A now rare movie with an actual theme to be learned. I did not feel this movie was creepy or disturbing in any way. The acting was very well done considering there were only a few characters in most of the movie.It was good entertainment and I'd watch it again!"
" Definitely a must watch.
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,8,"At first I thought it's just a kind of another interstellar or gravity kind of movie.yes,it is a movie of that kind but it's a kind of different one.It is like the sets of gravity kind of movies is used to make a love kind of film.There is lot to watch in it. Its a kind of fantasy film like living alone with the girl you loved a lot and no one awake except you and her for More than 50 years . Definitely this thought feels u engaged.so go watch it and feel the thrill."
" opinion
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,4,"the romance thing in this movie ruined this up, like the context its pretty cool, but the couple thing and the horrible loving-drama scenes are totally disasters. By the other side the special effects are pretty great so as the photography and all, if you enjoy movies about space travel machine and all RUN AWAY from this movie, its a romance movie, end of the line."
" A Few Years to Go
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,9,"Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence, a pair made in heaven--two actors with enough chemistry and charm to burn pull this off. ""Passengers"" gives us the premise that it's possible to make it through years of solitude or spending the rest of your life with another person without causing body harm to each other, or killing your audience with a trite and boring script. The audience makes it safely to the end of the story, and it's an exciting and imaginative ride.Pratt and Lawrence are the main stars here, carrying 90% of the film. Nevertheless, they get some help from two solid actors Michael Sheen and Lawrence Fishbourne. Their roles are small but key to the main twists. It's always a pleasure to see good actors do good work.Because of unexpected complications, Pratt is awakened from hibernation way too early on his route to the colonization of a new planet. A consequence of this event is that he must now endure 90 years of solitude and will probably die alone on route. Being a flawed human, he reaches the point when he considers ending this problem, but he's charmed by a vision of the perfect mate, and matters become even more complicated as she awakens, too.We need a complication to make the plot more dramatic, and Lawrence soon realizes that there might be more to her hibernation ending. Simultaneously, electrical and computer functions begin to be affected by some unknown failure. It soon becomes clear that the trip might be cut short for all of the people on the ship, and it's up to our heroes to make things right.Much of the action is relegated to the end of the film, and it works. There are some tributes to films like ""Gravity"" and ""2001"", whether intentional or accidental, it doesn't matter. Maybe it shows just how visionary both of those films were. This genre is also benefiting from the more sophisticated special effects that can be added to create new and incredible settings for this type of story.None of this would work without the fine acting by Lawrence. She doesn't disappoint at all, bringing a complex character to life. She's a dreamer, a person who has managed to see herself as successful, who knows she has the skills to do it, but she is also a human being with needs and a past that can now make all the difference. She's resourceful and self-reliant; however she knows when it's time to ask for help, and all of this is beautifully demonstrated in her acting, which demands both emotional and physical dedication.Pratt is growing as an actor and hold his own against Lawrence. As I said before, their chemistry is palpable, and it doesn't hurt that both are very good looking and look amazing running around the ship or getting dressed up for a date.""Passengers"" might not change the history of cinema; still it shows there's still room for many new entries in Science Fiction, as long as they are done with care and skill. There's hope for the future."
" Perfect cast, thoughtful script, super realistic and important questions
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,10,"First if you realism and a great cast well you just hit a home run. Great special effects and thoughtful questions about mans need for each other. Often amusing and touching and with a great ending. Go buy some popcorn, but be prepared to talk about the issues raised in the movie after it is over."
" You have to watch this movie
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,10,"Passengers was one of those movies that draws you in. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. The story is fantastic, I have been waiting a long time to see a movie like this & Passengers will not disappoint. I heard many comments about the movie, Many were saying that it won't be very good because there aren't many cast members involved. That could not be further from the truth, The story simply draws you in. You won't be concerned that there are not many cast members involved. I would strongly recommend watching this movie."
" Almost Hard SF! And just plain terrific! Forget the critics- Just Watch It!
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,8,"After reading all the bad reviews before I thought this was gonna be crap so i was expecting zero going in. But from the very first moments this felt like true hard science fiction movie- the giant sleeper ship with the protective shield that preceded it felt like something straight out of Tau Zero or The Songs of Distant Earth, and everything that came after felt just plain Right. The events, decisions, mistakes and most of the physics felt plausible and realistic unlike any other SF movie I've seen of late.The only things that bother me after rewatching this a few times (scientifically) is how the constant thrust ion drive along with the ship will need to be flipped around mid-way through the journey to go from acceleration to deceleration. AT the end the ship is shown close to the planet but still in the same nose-front attitude. Also wouldn't the very slight iod drive thrust create a very slight gravity within the spinning section of the ship that is perpendicular to the centripetal gravity from the spin? But since its very very slight thrust it might be negligible.The slingshot around a red giant at 50% light was probably tacked on cos it looked good. Not even sure you can do a slingshot at such velocity. And was it to increase speed even further or as a course correction or both? Not sure. And at such high speed that type gravitational encounter might have actually ripped the ship apart. And definitely would not be visible at all to anyone watching cos of its approach speeds. It would be over almost instantly. Plus the red giant will be blue shifted to appear a blue color in the approach phase? Anyway this is all trivial nitpicking. The producers never said that this was a scientifically accurate- but the accuracy far outweigh the BS.The acting and story and all the decisions are just simply perfect for this type of endeavor. Never a moment did I think wow that was utterly stupid and unrealistic on his or her part. If I was stuck on a dead ship all alone and saw this beautiful woman I would definitely wrestle with myself whether to wake her or not. Who wants to die alone?So all in all this IS perfect Science Fiction. To HEll with the critics. They've been soul-sucked by the crap that was Gravity and Interstellar and The Farce Awakens and the Star Trek reboots that they don't know a GOOD THING when they see it. Simple as that.I just wished they had stretched out the ending a bit more and revealed that the couple had children and grandchildren and those kids would be waiting when the sleepers finally awoke."
" Enjoyable
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,10,"Wonderful, beautiful movie. It dwells on the contradictions between being alone for eternity or doing something that is regrettable. Loved the emotional tension, and almost forgot it was a Sci-fi flick.I would recommend it also to people who often doesn't watch these kind of movies."
" Excellent
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,10,"Great movie! Please ignore the pro critics. My simple standard of a good movie is ""would I watch it again?"" and the answer is a YES YES YES. Admittedly there are many many great movies but this is the 1st movie in a long time that just sticks with me. A powerful romance with a heart wrenching decision made by Pratt's character. There are no villains to root against, just awful and extremely unfortunate circumstances. By the end of the movie you cant help but come to the conclusion that the life they lived (and all the lives they saved) was in fact their true destiny. Obviously Pratt's decision is unfortunate, but definitely understood due to his diminished mental capacity."
" Yet another reason not to trust the Tomatometer, this one's worth seeing
",2017-03-23 00:00:00,7,"This is a very creative science fiction movie about a spacecraft come automated cruise ship that's headed for a distant planet with 5000 passengers and 258 crew members aboard in hibernation. The plan is for the travelers to be awakened once the ship is within 4 months of its destination Homestead II, where each will be given the opportunity to ""begin again"" as ""pioneers"" in the less crowded environs of a new world. The film deservedly received an Academy Award nomination for its Production Design; its Original Score was also Oscar nominated.The ship, its design, exterior and interior are a visual feast to behold, and its operations are beautifully imagined. The concept of transporting human beings a great distance from Earth by having them sleep - kept from aging during a decades-long journey in some sort of chamber - is not a new one, but the idea that the vehicle of transport could be a dream machine of this caliber is a new one, at least to this reviewer. The result is a magnificently realized luxury liner - complete with class distinctions - in space.The problem is that barely 30 years into its 120-year trip the computer controlled ship encounters a larger asteroid field than its shields were designed to withstand. The resulting damage, which for the most part is automatically 'healed' by the ship's systems, causes one passenger - Chris Pratt plays Jim Preston, a tradesman aka mechanic in (essentially) the steerage class - to be awakened.Preston is surprised to find he's the only one awake, and it's through him that we see all of the ship's features including instant food and a plethora of entertainment options. He's thrilled to finally find someone to talk to, even if it's just an android bartender named Arthur (Michael Sheen plays an integral role in the story). But Preston is despaired because there isn't any way for him to get into the ship's control room or restart his sleep chamber, so he's destined to die alone long before the destination.So lonely is he that even after deciding to ""live a little"" by breaking in to the ship's first class amenities (like suite accommodations), Preston contemplates waking up another passenger - a beautiful writer he discovers in one of his low moments - to join him. After a year on the ship with only Arthur to share his time with - and months of wrestling with this ethical dilemma, Preston does in fact awake Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence).What follows is another year on the ship during which Aurora, unaware that Preston had awakened her, finally accepts that her planned life is lost such that she allows herself to fall in love with him. They have a fairytale romance until she learns the truth, and Aurora's passion is turned to rage against Preston. She nearly kills him before realizing that he'd allow her to do it. The two then coexist on the ship, not talking with each other while agreeing to split time with Arthur as their only companion.But the failing ship soon becomes the most pressing issue, and the latest emergency finally awakens a crew member. But Laurence Fishburne's character - who lives for only a few hours - is really just a plot device that provides information and a few other necessary elements in order that Aurora and Preston have to pull together to save themselves, the ship and its asleep crew and passengers. That's not to say that this part of the story comes off as too obviously contrived, until perhaps in retrospect (which might lead one to other troubling questions).There's one more semi-suspenseful moment at the very end, which will probably satisfy most, even though Aurora never acknowledges that she was fated not to live the life she'd planned whether Preston had awakened her or not."
" Non-Spoiler Review
",2017-03-23 00:00:00,9,"While primarily a Sci-fi movie, there are elements of humor, romance, and suspense that tugs at you. The movie puts you in an unimaginable place, probably difficult to fantasize. The challenges of the human condition are addressed with a plot deeper than most would expect from a science fiction movie. Fantastic movie! I immediately purchased it after renting it on-demand. You will not regret watching it."
" Engrossing science fiction
",2017-03-23 00:00:00,7,"You may think that a movie with just three (but mostly 2) actors might be boring, but just the opposite. The story line is simple, and the plot mostly believable, with some the plot is predictable, but the ending is not. Perhaps this is not a movie for hard core science fiction fans, but the graphics, though not spectacular, are good. It is an enjoyable movie."
" Depends on your Mindset, *Spoiler*
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,7,"I'm a hard core Sci Fi fan and avid reader. With that said, this movie had some serious intellectual errors, design flaws, and common sense issues. However, I've yet to find a really good sci fi movie that covers all of that. Something to do with Hollywood I think. Putting that all aside, it had awesome visual effects and it followed a fairly standard romantic comedy theme with a little drama thrown in. I'd give it a 7, maybe 7.5 out of 10. BUT, if you are a student or follower of all things hateful, then you will become very upset over the Helsinki type behavior and overall evil story line of a man tricking a poor helpless woman into falling in love with him, the ""Ultimate Crime"". I personally think they should have reversed the roles of Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence, thereby bypassing their 'outrage'."
" Excellent film with solid acting from an all-star cast
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,8,"This movie is very well put together. The premise has been panned by critics, unfairly in my opinion, because the movie does not dodge the issue. It's the central point of conflict that the movie builds around. Moving past that we have a sci-fi version of Sleeping Beauty, only this is a modern fairytale, so there's no guarantee we'll see a happy ending. The acting is solid, particularly by Jennifer Lawrence. And the film makes good use of the few actors that are part of the story. There aren't many extras in the film but that only helps build the sense of loneliness that is a central part of the story. The bartender character is very well done by Michael Sheen and not overplayed like his Tron character. The set is magnificent and CGI is well done. The only part I didn't like was the slightly overplayed sense of urgency the film tries to inject into the final moments leading up to the climax. It feels a bit too contrived and could have been overcome with better direction."
" Passengers ye..p!
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,10,"This sci-fi I been waiting to see it in 4K for quite some time and I finally was able to rent it in such format, this film to begin with isin my opinion is very refreshingly well acted with a sexy cast the film is clever and touching full of beauty and deep human emotions and manipulation plus some horrible scenarios of what if... kinda! of suggested questions to the audience; I personally like this movie a lot it was a lot beater than expected this time the critics got it wrong, because passengers is a one hell of an interesting clever story made for scfi fans. My advice Rent this film in 4k You won't go wrong on your rental guarantee. Whoop! Whoop! Juggalos"
" Another win for recent films within the Sci-Fi genre
",2017-03-21 00:00:00,8,"I happened to miss this film when it had its theatrical run in theaters but a friend recently brought my attention to it and I am happy he did.""Passengers"" is fueled with impressive performances given the small cast consisting primarily of Chris Pratt, Jennifer Lawrence, Michael Sheen, and Lawrence Fishburne. While Pratt and Lawrence, once again, presented their strong range of skill within their acting expertise, Michael Sheen was a standout and very memorable to me. Regardless, everyone did such a strong job and kept me very immersed in an ever- changing complex story of survival given it was a small cast.As I said previously, the story, although seeming like a simple ABS story, changes frequently and throws a wide range of emotions at you throughout its entire run time. Every emotion from positive to negative, ""Passengers"" is a film to remember.Definitely worth a watch.-- Oberrated.com --"
" Loved it
",2017-03-21 00:00:00,7,"This was great. The two leads had great chemistry together - I guess they'd have to! It was never dull, very beautiful to look at, good acting - what more could you want from a popcorn movie? It was thought- provoking in a superficial kind of way, but even after all they went through, I would love to go on this kind of mission. I'd take my chances."
" Not a really good movie, it's more of a cheesy romantic movie that you can't stop thinking about the flaws in the scenario
",2017-03-21 00:00:00,2,"The film was super cheesy and irrational, its like they have asked a five year old girl to write the scenario and a 6 year old boy interrupted her scenario every once just to give it a touch of boyish theme. The ending was super ridiculous and the fact that a journalist and a mechanic are fixing everything while they don't even have the slightest idea is just stupid. The only good thing i can say is, if you're looking for a cheesy soupy film to watch it with your partner is that you can start making out at the middle if the movie and come back when the movie is finished, this is your movie :)"
" Sci-fi movie at its finest!
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,8,"This is a great example of the perfect concoction between sci-fi and romance. This movie gives us the right amount of science talk without confusing us. Most sci-fi movies got a little too deep in the science region that left us perplexed and wondering. The space ship design was extraordinarily stunning, the gravitational usage was spot on. The chemistry between Jim and Aurora was very well made. I couldn't help but getting Star Lord vibe from Chris Pratt, but that is besides the point. J-Law was wonderful (as always). I was so hooked with the drama and romance, that when it reverted to thriller mode, I got really excited. And let me tell you, I find most drama-romance genre to be a snooze, but not with this one. I gave it 9, because it's nearly perfect. The only reason why I didn't give it a 10 is because in my opinion, 10 is only for God. So in other words, I think this movie is perfect."
" skip it
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,1,"Do not say I did not tell you.Wasted some time this weekend when The Wife & I rented Passengers via our Verizon Fios cable for $5.99.Who could give this Hollywood cookie-cutter, intent on extrapolating $ from the pockets of movie-goers based solely on Jen Laurence's BO appeal, a favorable review? Cheesy, predictable, & accompanied by a miserable script. Crikey! The best acting in the movie comes from the android bartender.One thing is for sure..........having just last year for the first (& V LAST) time, experienced the world of over-priced, incompetently managed, ocean cruise liners.........they got that part exactly right!Sorry consolation for a POS movie, however."
" Enjoyable
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,8,"I think most people would enjoy this movie except those that like to complain about incorrect physics when they clearly don't have a clue either. There is something for everyone unless you really need hardcore action.Whilst the premise, script, effects and cinematography are all very good, what surprised me the most was the quality of the acting - first rate all round.Like many others I don't understand the critics reaction to the film. Many seemed to be trying to pick fault with silly issues such as 'why only one medical pod' or 'how can he disable a cryo chamber but not repair one'. Desperate indeed..."
" Enjoyable Mindless Fantasy
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,6,"First off this review may contain spoilers.Went into this film with an open mind on a day where focusing on an intelligent film was out of the question. Just wanted to relax and watch something entertaining. Passengers is this type of film. One you can just sit back and watch--leave the room and come back to without missing too much (during the first half to three quarters). The special effects are outstanding even though the science behind the ship and space is unrealistic and in many cases flat out wrong. That's OK for this type of fantasy romance where the plot revolves around the characters and no so much in the science. Still, some of the errors are so blatant that anyone can point them out--which I will not do as many others have done well in this regard.Lawrence and Pratt are entertaining and have good chemistry. If this were not the case, I'd probably have turned it off. Sheen does an admirable job and carries a good part of the film particularly before Aurora's awakening. I especially enjoyed the 'Lloyd' type character he portrays as a tribute to the Shining. Sure it's been done--but there had to be someone or something for Jim to talk with otherwise any sane person would last only a few months before losing their mind.The main plot could be a real life issue sometime in the future. It's hard to say how many years in the future the story takes place--but it must be centuries as there are many colonies and thus many of these vessels successfully fulfilling their missions. This is where reality ends--as the ship contains little in the way of redundancy--and where many viewers are turned off by the lack of realism. Chill--just remember what you're watching. This is not Asimov. I would've preferred Aurora finding out in a different manner. She's an intelligent journalist and yet couldn't piece together that Jim had awakened her? Especially knowing he's a mechanic by trade? Having Aurora linking the clues together while falling in love, would've added more tension to the film.Those that say, why didn't they wake the crew up? Well, the crew was not in the pods in the main area--they were behind high security doors. And thus impossible to reach. Which, both tried and failed. Realistic? No. Some security override would be in place to ensure in the unlikely event someone did wake up, they'd be able to seek some type of help. Perhaps another android. Like I said, this is fantasy so just enjoy it.The ending could have made the movie more palatable for the critics, had Jim died. Then Aurora would be faced with making the same decision he made--and leaving the door open for a gut wrenching open ending. All in all--a watchable, enjoyable film. Would I watch it again? Probably not in a sit down watch. But playing it in the background would be fine. There's enough substance and beauty in the effects to make it a 2 hour screen saver while you're doing housework or visiting with friends."
" beautiful movie
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,9,"Oh it's been a long time that I enjoyed a sci fi movie like this. In fact I don't like today's sci fi at all, but Passengers has that existentialistic feeling that I love so much from the 1970's sci fi movies like Omega Man and The Andromeda Strain. The visuals and the acting are amazing. Watching the spaceship interiors is like living there. The futuristic design is fantastic. Chris Pratt looked never more honest and sincere and Jennifer Laurence is a always a natural. In the end the story becomes somehow a bit cliché, but I don't mind."
" Mediocre, Cliché, Sci-fi
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,5,"This is how big Hollywood studios do science fiction. They dumb it down, water it down, add big name star power, add some explosions and action, add some cheesy romance, add a mandatory sex scene, and turn it into inoffensive pabulum for the masses. In fact, I have trouble even calling this move science fiction since there is so very ""science"" involved. Grade school level astronomy students should be capable of laughing at this movie, but the real problem is that it's more of a cheesy romantic comedy than sci-fi. The bulk of the movie is dedicated to following the evolution of the romantic relationship between the two main characters. This choice means that a lot of the actually interesting things that could have explored - such as moral dilemmas, the effects of extreme isolation, the fragility of humanity in the face of space - were all shuffled to the back-burner. After the movie expends itself on the romance story, a cliché filled action sequence wraps it up in a neat little package, and the ending ties it up with a bow. In summary, it's a visually interesting romance story stuffed into a sci-fi package. I suppose if I was looking for a romance story involving Jennifer Lawrence, I'd be all over it. But I wanted a science fiction movie. I feel a bit duped. A generous 5/10."
" Read Viewer Reviews, Not The Critics...Fake News!
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,8,"I don't know why this movie has such a bad wrap. I ended up not seeing it at the theaters because of all the negative press and wish I had just went. It was brilliant and a lot of fun. Seems like most reviewers felt betrayed by a critical plot device...not sure why, it was just good storytelling. Sorry if you are the type that wants to know the whole movie in a preview.I prefer to not know everything before I go in...Force Awakens was a good example of how to maintain some mystery. Anyway - I'm sure my low expectations going in made it seem much better than it might be - but I imagine I'll see it again. It is decent sci-fi that was a good use of 2 hours. Don't miss out - rent or buy it today!"
" Good and Bad
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,6,"If you can get by the literary license that said their was no safety system or protocol to prevent this event from happening, Passengers is a very attractive movie, with exception for the ending. I wish that these wannabe story-tellers would stop over-thinking the story. I just want to be entertained. In this movie, the writer and/or director and/or producer did what other entertainment business people and industry professionals have done. They made a calculated decision to show their audience that they are not afraid to have a dark ending. Dark endings without dramatic meaning are just sad."
" A Love Story, sort of
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,10,"Over 5000 people in hibernation pods on the starship Avalon are heading to the planet Homestead II, which is 120 years away. Something happens and Jim (Chris Pratt) wakes up 90-years before the ship is to land. After a year alone, he wakes up a very pretty Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence) from her pod. He admits to the Android bartender, Arthur (Michael Sheen), that he feels guilty about waking her up. Later when the very pretty Aurora finds out what Jim did there is hell to pay and the relationship is now on shaky ground. I saw this as a love story, sort of, and although this is a slow- going I am held by the banter between Jim and the very pretty Aurora and the set design of the ship and these scenes are fantastic. The stunts and computer special effects are exceptional. Kudos.We see Gus (Laurence Fishburne) - a deck crew chief – appear as his pod also malfunctions. His appearance is crucial to the story because he knows something is wrong with the ship and he tells the pretty Aurora and Jim to find the main cause of the ship malfunctioning. Then a hole appears in the ship and the very pretty Aurora and Jim must find a way to work together to save the ship and themselves. Can a very pretty Aurora find a way to use Gus's wristband to override medical commands in the infirmary to save a life? Inquiring Minds are watching closely. Later Jim finds a way to allow a very pretty Aurora to go back into a hibernation pod to continue her journey to Homestead II.All in all this is quite enjoyable and we stay engaged because we are not sure what will happen next and will Jim and the pretty Aurora get back together? Inquiring minds are on the job. Then we see a note on the screen that says: 88 years later. (What? This is over already?)Then we see the formerly hibernated people open a door to the rest of the ship and we are allowed to see what they see. This is a really good ending. Sad, but good. (10/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes. Nudity: Yes, a male backside. Language: Brief soft stuff only."
" the best after gravity
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,9,the best movie i have watched after gravity. don't believe in haters at least watch it once u will not be disappointed ... happy watching :) if u want to figure out some mistakes then there will be mistakes in every movie..appreciate the acting of jenifer Lawrence and chris prat. enjoyed it a lot loved this movie
" Excellent !
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,10,"This is a beautiful movie, I enjoy every minute and I don't understand why this movie have only 7 stars. I want to correct this. So, first question is: What do you expect from movie ? This movie have everything, story, love, effects, excellent acting and action in a dose to make you happy all day, and I bet you will watch lots of scenes again. What do you want more ? If you have someone beside you, you will be kiss him (her) after the movie finished and love more. You will be also little crying or very close to it. My full recommendation for this movie."
" Oh my GOD !
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,1,"Your classic story about guy wakes up early, guy needs sex, guy..... I'm not gonna spoil it.Story is absolutely AWFUL, in fact, there IS NO story whatsoever. If this IS a story, it's a SICK one. Worthless ! Time wasted ! Don't even watch it to the end! You'll get sick!"
" TV episode stretched to movie length
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,5,"At the beginning of the movie, something happened. Then a long time passed and then another thing happened. Then a very very long time passed before another thing happened.Of course, those long times are filled by time fillers, like chatting with a bar tender, more chatting with a bar tender, going on a date, and going on another date, etc.It's a good thing I watched this on DVD, so I could fast forward through the time-fillers.When I encountered the first few time-fillers, I had a sinking feeling this movie was not going to have much of a plot. And that is exactly how it turned out. If the time-fillers are edited out, the movie would be less than an hour long.How can this movie get a 7.0 rating? Perhaps some viewers mistaken this for a romance movie, or they are dazzled by Jennifer Lawrence's many sexy costumes."
" Best Spaceship Ever Filmed
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,9,"Others have said it all, and better. This movie has the WOW factor like nothing else, and realism to spare. The design of the spaceship is the most unique, intelligent and forward thinking of any ever filmed. You can love the Enterprise in Star Trek, and cool spacecraft in everything from Aliens to Gravity to Lost in Space. The space craft in Passengers is out of this world, and yet makes perfect sense as you watch its spiraling parts and force field bubble nose. Jennifer Lawrence continues her professional journey as one of the elite actresses of her generation. She's sexy, vulnerable, emotional and deep. Chris Pratt is charming without being an idiot, and rises to the challenge better than you'd expect. They're not Spencer and Hepburn, but their relationship and chemistry are special.It's not perfect, but you'll look at your watch and wonder how 1:56:11 went by so quickly. Great pacing, great acting, excellent story and the best spaceship design in the history of sci-fi. 9 out of 10, and props to everyone involved."
" Entertaining edge of the seat sci-fi, lacks a strong theme
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,7,"The plot of this film will keep you on the edge of the seat, and the depiction of how interstellar travel might happen at some point in the future is very entertaining. However I didn't feel like the movie contained any well developed theme or any message. The most interesting theme was the notion that we have very little control over our lives. The two passengers have their own hopes and dreams about the future, but ultimately they have little control over making these dreams a reality, instead they are just ""passengers"", and must simply make the best of what they have. I think this theme gets drowned out by the exploration of the ship's luxurious facilities, and the romance between Lawrence and Pratt. As a sucker for anything to do with sci-fi and space travel, I did enjoy it. However, I think it had more potential."
" Great movie, disappointing ending
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed the movie but the ending was really disappointing. The ""revive"" scene is one we have seen a hundred times before in so many other movies. I think it would have made a great ending for him to die there and Aurora ending up waking up someone else as she faces the same situation as Jim's at the beginning of the movie."
" Do not listen to Critics!
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,10,"Almost did not watch because of the critics views, but went with gut and the dozens of times I ignore them as they tend to NOT get it right. It was a perfect love story in space. Boy meets girl...girl tries to kill him but ultimately falls for the guy!! It was different but pairing Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence was a great call. Love them both and enjoyed to movie. Only bad part,that beard Chris,enough said!!"
" Didn't contain enough action
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,4,"Now, I love sci-fi. Like crazy! I was looking forward to seeing this movie A LOT but was disappointed after watching it. Yes, I like a movie that contains plenty of action - and I do like movies that have less. However, this movie had ZERO action except for one or two scenes. The rest was either sex scenes or figuring out ""how to fix the problem"". I believe that this movie could have been a huge success, if there had been more ""liveliness"". Was disappointed. I'm putting 4 stars as there was some good acting in this film. Overall though, it could have been better."
" Better than what critics say
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,7,"The movie was better than I thought. At first I was expecting some kind of a cliché movie that has a cookie cutter plot, this is probably the first movie where the whole idea of a generational ship is fleshed out.The movie does contain numerous plot holes, artistic licenses, and inaccuracies but I guess all movies have them. For example, why would they fly a colony ship with only one auto doc (considering that the ship has 5000 passengers), with a rather mediocre computer repair subroutine, and no way to wake a crew member should something go wrong. The way the ship's computer assuming that no failure or errors could happen just seems to suggest to me that they treat those colony ships as expendable. They could just wake a handful of crew members every year for a couple of weeks to check things and make sure everything work the way they should. In fact it seems irresponsible that there's no way to put someone in stasis again (more auto docs anyone??) Despite that, I still think the movie is better than what their box office performance suggests, namely the whole colony ship idea and how things could possibly go wrong, so if humanity were to do anything like this in the future they'd know to plan ahead...I somehow think that they could have very easily said that Earth was destroyed in some disaster (giant asteroid impacts or something) and that Avalon is one of the many colony ships sent out in order to preserve humanity... it would certainly make the plot far more dire because now instead of saving just a few thousand lives, they are saving mankind."
" Boring
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,2,"I give it a 2, because of what it is ... a movie with no hollyweed morality ... nobody comes out-of-the-closet ... no gender confusion ... just boy sees girl ... boy unfreezes girl ... girl finds out and an hates boy ... have crisis ... girl loves boy and boy gets girl. Pretty simple stuff.The plot? If there is one ... sucks, of course. Here you have a deep space ship ... on auto pilot ... the defenses are over whelmed by space rocks and the ship tries to repair itself. One does wonder ... if the ship can repair itself (or can't)... why can't it bring the required crew members out of stasis to fix things?If they cannot go back into stasis ... then how did the girl expect to get back to earth? Our hero managed to 'hack' into the deluxe suite, but couldn't 'hack' into the food synthesizer? But yet he figures out how to repair the engines?There are no small utility craft or shuttles? They have to use the same - sorry - tether we've seen in a bunch of other space movies?90% of this move could have been made in a high school cafeteria and shopping mall. This is a waste of time ... unless you want to watch a normal couple, for a change. It would have been better if the crew woke up to their descendants standing there?At lease it did not make you want to vomit."
" Chick flick disguised as Sci-fi
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,2,"I hate myself for watching this movie 90 minutes straight expecting it to get any good. I mean, for the first 30 minutes or so it seems to go somewhere so I was (kind of) engaged. Then it gets boring and really, really corny. This is not sci fi, don't be fooled. This is a modern version of Titanic, nothing more, nothing less. Well, actually much, much cornier. So, after watching 90 minutes of this crap I decided to fast forward to the last 5 minutes just to see how it ended, and oh boy, it was just as expected. Corny chick flick with a predictable ending disguised as Sci-fi.You've been warned."
" I Don't Get How People Can Support This
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,1,"This may or may not be considered a spoiler.A common thread that I see in these reviews is ""It was an awesome movie, I don't get why people hate it,"" and ""Haters Gonna Hate."" Real simple: I am not going to encourage or support a glorified rape fantasy.That is all this movie is."
" What Would YOU Do?
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,9,"I don't understand all of the bashing of this movie. Many people seem to focus on the ""creepiness"" of Pratt's character, how his actions were unethical and criminal (this is true), and the general ridiculousness of how Pratt originally arrived at his initial situation (e.g., a spaceship with no contingency capabilities for hibernation, a ship for over 5,000 people with only one Auto Doc, no alarms which would wake crew members, no rotating shift of engineering and crew members to keep constant watch on a ship carrying that many passengers while navigating through the deep vacuum of space, etc.). I agree with most of this, but I think many people miss the point that the story was trying to tell. This wasn't a movie about the theoretical accuracy of space travel, or that gave much thought to the principles of engineering design or safety during space travel (especially for a 120 year trip), and it wasn't intended to. My view is that this story was centrally about a moral dilemma, and the human condition. If you were on a journey like the one Pratt's character experienced, and to your horror, you woke up with 90 years left to go knowing that there was nothing you could do to go back to sleep, nothing you could to do escape, and you would die alone without any possibility of human contact or connection for the rest of your life, what would you do? One of the things stories do is force us to confront the human condition. Good stories force us to think about what we would do. If you were in Pratt's character's situation, what would you do? Would you be able to live for 50-60 years without another human being to talk to or experience your life with? Would you be able to survive the rest of your life trapped on a spaceship, repeating the same unfulfilling and meaningless activities over and over again without anyone else to keep you company or share your day with? Would you be able to resist the temptation of waking up another human being so that you would be able to escape your loneliness? Would you be able to take the moral high ground and be brave enough to end your life and escape your misery instead of giving into the temptation of rousing another human being but, at the same time, knowing you are condemning them to your same fate? We all would like to think we would take the moral and ethical high ground, but none of us will ever know until we are faced with that situation. To me, this is a movie about the human desire for love and companionship (not sex as some people are ridiculously making this out to be), and sometimes that may lead desperate and lonely people to do unethical things. I feel like most people are missing that message. Exploring the fragility of someone's morals when tested in an extreme circumstance is an interesting theme. People vastly overestimate their ability to deal with traumatic events. Self preservation is a powerful thing, and so is loneliness. We can see Pratt's character going through the trauma of contemplating suicide. We can see Pratt's character going through the moral and ethical dilemma of whether or not he should wake Lawrence's character up, and once he does, he panics and feels the wrong in that action in his gut; he feels guilty and ashamed, and this is apparent with his character for many of his interactions with Lawrence's character. While I would have preferred that the story explored the potential acceptance, healing, reconciliation, and forgiveness process that Lawrence's character may have gone through instead of an imminent disaster bringing about an almost forced reconciliation, I still think the direction the film took worked, even though it felt slightly rushed. I did feel that in the moments when Pratt's character was about to face an almost certain death, that is when Lawrence's character came to the realization that if he DID die, she would then be faced with the same situation that Pratt's character was faced with at the beginning of the film, and that terrified her. Maybe at that moment, she realized how and why he was able to do what he did, as Lawrence's character professes that if he dies, she dies. In the end, Pratt's character, to me, redeemed himself. He found additional capability under a higher security access level of the Auto Doc that would allow someone to be put back to sleep; but since there was only one Auto Doc, only one of them could go back to sleep. The other, as in the beginning of the film, would be forced to live the rest of their life alone on the ship. If he hadn't learned his lesson, he could have hid this from Lawrence's character again, but instead he chooses to share it with her, and offers it to her to allow her the opportunity to live the life she wanted in recompense for waking her to fulfill his needs knowing that he would be alone again with only memories of her. He does a complete 180, and instead of doing the selfish thing, he does the honorable thing; and after this experience, I honestly think that if Lawrence's character did choose to go back to sleep, Pratt's character wouldn't have attempted to wake another passenger again. It is this sequence of events, I think, that allow Lawrence's character to forgive him and choose to spend her life on the ship with him. All in all, I liked this movie a lot because it did make me ask what I would do in that situation, and really try to contemplate the fragile and emotional perspectives of both characters. What Pratt's character did was wrong, and what Lawrence's character experienced as a result of Pratt's action was wrong, but given the situation, which path would you take?"
" Beats Gravity
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,8,Well to start we have our male who is awakened. Mind you seeing the pod with the LAWRENCE lying in state should waken any one. There have been a few other tales out there with early waking of our heroes. The one that first comes to mind is the early sequences of ALIEN. Still hard to better those opening minutes considering how long ago that was.This the usual tale of a sleeping journey to a colony and answered a question that I always have regarding space travel. Just how much damage can anything earth built take on such a journey when the smaller debris that is undoubtedly out there in some quantity is not charted and by its constant movement can hardly ever be. These things must surely collide and create further problems. an attempt to tell us how they might get protected was on display but in truth that idea looks like a no go in reality.As far as the story goes within the bounds of future plausibility it all seems possible. Like a modern day liner at sea the unexpected can happen and here it did. The story that unfolded told us that the male wanted a mate and picked one that was desirable. Had Aurora been a transgender or Lesbian would another pod have to be opened. If our male had indeed been similar would there have been a need to open two pods one male and one to breed?.Tale was for the most part normal dialogue drama with some minor excitement and humour but the ending cannot be really faulted for its life threatening moments and that the attempted sacrifice was reversible gives the audience a feel good ending. Well we cant have Jennifer being on her own for 88 years. Note that time spent in the hunger games came in handy. It must also noted that the moment where she assaulted out hero was a good piece of anger despair acting. I enjoyed this more so than Gravity and Arrival even though it had Amy Adams Jennifer played her part well. As per usual and not Bradley in sight unless he occupied one of the pods. My only problem was with the sudden increase of knowledge both acquired towards the end.
" Easily the best movie I've seen in the past year or so
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,9,"My wife and I watch a lot of movies, typically several a week. I say ""watch"" because it usually entails having a movie on the TV which she watches after I get bored, usually within the first thirty minutes or so.Not so with this movie. It was the first movie in quite a while that kept me involved from start to finish. The acting is good, the set is good, the special effects are good, but most importantly, the plot is unique and interesting. The utter predictability of most movies causes me to lose interest quickly, but that was not the case with Passengers. I never knew for certain what was going to happen, literally until after the movie was over.For me, the ultimate measure of a movie is how long I think about it after it's over. In this case, I am still thinking about it the next day."
" Passengers: The Beautiful People Movie
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,6,"I was highly skeptical of Passengers, though I liked the concept I simply couldn't see past the studio literally picking the two ""Hottest"" young current stars as the leads. It all seemed so forced, right down to their criminally photoshopped cover images.Not anything against them, they are a talented pair. But their chemistry wasn't there and that's something you'd think would be a problem with the creators not something to be ignored for the purpose of ratings. I mean they did have a $110 million budget to make back.Heavily promoted, this is one I couldn't avoid if I wanted to so I eventually took the dive and found myself torn with the results.First off as you'd expect for a movie of that budget it all looks great, polished to near perfection the film is a visual treat no doubt.Trouble is the movie is your standard Hollywood formula, predictable, clichéd & shiny. Though the premise is solid, the creators clearly didn't know how to fully utilize this so the movie fell short.Top that off with me thinking Pratt should stick to comedy and being poorly cast here and the movie was littered with flaws.But again it's big and it's shiny and Lawrence looks beautiful as always so it's very easy to be distracted by the fact that the movie isn't actually very good. The ending I found questionable but overall this could have been a complete garbage fire, yet avoided this and resulted in a watchable effort if you can get through the overbearing Hollywood tropes."
" Not worth watching
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,1,"To be honest I found this film a waste of the actors involved.The special effects are great, but the story was boring and flat. Michael sheen is a great character actor and this film hardly stretched his skills as an actor.Not suspenseful enough apart from where Jennifer Lawrence gets trapped in the bubble of water formed by the swimming pool area going to zero gravity.Could have easily shaved half an hour off the film and without affecting the story. This is really a story about a relationship they just decided to set it in space."
" Incredible
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,10,"There's just some movies out there that you die to find, it has amazing acting, a plot that's worth exploring as it actually has potential to be true to life and an amazing love story. Perhaps I've watched to much ""Masters of Sex"" but i cannot get over the robot bartender. the concept is brilliant. Jennifer L. Is just gorgeous as always and my wife thought Chris was his usual amazingly handsome guy. This show did it right with graphics, less is more. spend the money to make the scenes needing the wow factor and make up the rest with story. Passengers did this very well. As for the current star status obviously a 7 out of 10 is great, but i think it deserves more. As a photographer i have to look at these movies more critically and they really did a great job pulling in the viewers to a romantic atmospsphere that personally stuck my wife and I to the couch the entire time in suspense. Also another thingi have to give this movie props for is the previews. They were informative of what the movie was about, but not at all to revealing which made it all that much more pleasurable to learn subtle but very relevant details in the film.Glad this movie was nominated for some awards this Oscar season as it means that it was generally conceived by most as a good flick."
" surprised
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,4,i love Jennifer Lawrence and once i saw those two lead roles making a movie together i knew that i had to watch it. i was so excited that i dropped everything and watched it immediately. to be honest i was excited at first but after about 10 minutes of the movie i just got bored. i started playing with my phone and moving around waiting for something to catch my eye. Eventuallt the movie wasn't that bad that is why i gave it a 4/10. when the movie was about to finish that is when i started getting excited and happy. the last few scenes where really good that i enjoyed them more. so if i wanna sum up my review i would say that i only enjoyed the last 30 minutes of the whole movie.
" Not at all the kind of film I expected
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,10,"When I first saw the first trailer for Passengers, I thought that there would be bad guys and an evil maniacal plot against the main characters, I thought it would be a sci-fi mystery thriller. But that is not at all what it is. Don't go into this film expecting all that, because you will be disappointed if you do, well you'll be disappointed if that's what you want. This ultimately is a tragic romance set in space with sci-fi elements. And given that that's what it is, the movie succeeds, it knows what it is and it plays along with that plot well. Pratt and Lawrence have good romantic on screen chemistry and the love scenes between them work well because you can clearly see the feelings they share. The visual effects are absolutely STUNNING! I really loved seeing the spectacular imagery, whether it was seeing out the windows into space, or seeing humongous stars as the starship passed by, it was all designed so well, and it deserves the two academy award nominations it received. If you know what this movie is and you embrace it for that, then I think you'll really enjoy it. I know I did. 10/10 for Passengers!"
" So Human
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,10,"The ideas, human feelings, reactions, that longing to have someone to share with him/her your life (good or bad).. we do not have but each other. nothing can replace human existence by anything else even universe beauty.. beside all of this these two quotes (-You know, I'm not saying the universe is evil, but it sure has a nasty sense of humor. -How is that? -You get to fly to another planet, but you'll die along the way. and you find the perfect woman right in front of you yet she's completely out of reach.) (You can't get so hung up on where you'd rather be that you forget to make the most of where you are.) Thank you Chris and Jeniffer"
" Lawrence gets her shirt off.
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,4,"Not being a Social Justice Brownshirt forced to run in screaming outrage from any film, play or book which contains a plot element I find knee-jerkingly offensive, I was perfectly able to settle in to enjoy Passenger's traditionally uninspiring tale of ""girl meets slightly rapey boy, jumps boys bones, falls out with boy, gets rescued by boy and lives with boy happily ever after"" in space.Well, I say ""enjoy"", actually the plot is laughably thin and one- dimensional, the obviously thorny issue of the boy awakening the chick he has the hots for to her irredeemable doom is disappointingly briefly addressed and the otherwise bland fairy tale romance is tedious to say the least. It's a pity, actually, because the issues raised by the space- prisoner's dilemma of who, if anyone, to wake from the vessel's choice of thousands and condemn to his fate, either to stave off loneliness, start a family, or to help extricate himself from this sentence of a lifetime alone was an intriguing one, and could have made for a deeply interesting and thoughtful film. Unfortunately the writers decided not to go that route. It's possible they toyed briefly with the notion of turning their work into a space-parody since the comedy robot bartender, played by Michael Sheen was by far the most human of the on-board characters, and certainly the fortuitous appearance and immediate demise of the token black dude is well within ironic boundaries.I must admit that despite not really rating Jennifer Lawrence as an actress - given that her range of facial expressions only barely exceeds that of Noomi Rapace, who, as we can all tell, has had her musculi faciei surgically disconnected - I was really quite impressed by her emotive performance. She genuinely managed to look both upset and slightly worried on occasion. Well I was convinced.Unfortunately, despite the lush, if somewhat scientifically unlikely, design of the ship and its on-board technologies I found the film simply boring. When it got to the (inevitable) point at which Jennifer Lawrence was forced to strip off due to the intense heat of the ship's exploding engines I couldn't help barking with laughter thinking of that brilliant moment in Galaxy Quest's Star Trek parody when Alan Rickman snidely comments to Tim Allen ""I see you managed to get your shirt off!""So at that point I turned off Passengers and re-watched Galaxy Quest instead. I recommend you do the same. I give Passengers a 4 for ""pretty, but not worth finishing""."
" Disappointing
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,6,"Wish I would have read the first paragraph of Rolling Stone's review before wasting my time watching this. ""Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt can do anything ... or so you'd think. But Passengers – a chemistry-free, agonizingly slow sci-fi misfire – blows a hole in that theory. Star power can only go so far when the screenwriter (Jon Spaihts) and director (Morten Tyldum) snooze on the job."""
" Why the bad reviews???
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,8,"The movie was made so well. The amazing graphics, the plot line and the acting all were excellent. Jennifer Lawrence especially did really well, and so did Chris Pratt and the bartender guy (forgot his name). I understand that some of the things in the movie were not shown in a lot of detail or explained in a scientific way but they are showing the future and space travel so give them a break! They can get away with a few things for me, because overall the movie was really fun to watch. Highly recommended, lets change the rating together. ;)"
" Afraid to be simple
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,5,"I didn't see the trailer of the movie up until writing this review. So I decided to look the movie based on reading the story line. So I didn't know it will turn into a semi-disaster movie.The premise is very good. It's quite original and sets a stage for inquiries into ethics, relations, meaning of life, happiness and loneliness. Enveloped in science fiction combines good special effects and some really cool ideas (like the pool with a view to the stars).I liked the choice of the leads. Especially the female lead, since she had to be sexy. Generally, a very good job of portraying the emotions.Unfortunately, things started to take the wrong turn with the appearance of Laurence Fishburne's character. When philosophical questions were replaced by technical malfunctions that made little sense and that I just didn't care about. And questions of ethics and the perception of happiness were substituted by the usual hero type of actions that introduce stupidity and deteriorate the whole experience.Eventually 'Passengers' stayed very shallow on its initial premise and didn't explore any of the vast number of interesting possibilities it could have been. Seems to be the usual case of Hollywood compromising good story for special effects to draw the audience. Considering the lead actors involved, its' quite a shame they needed that. When it comes to numbers, the studios may be right. But I fail to see it wins lots of hearts."
" Life Journey
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,10,"It isn't for the first time, and will surely happen again, that one truly valuable film story stays shadowed in order to highlight profit-making blockbusters.So, Passengers is a beautiful story about human life and its destiny. It is projected through the lens not compliant with the perceptions typical of so-called ""critics"". An enormous visual scenery is fully backed up with the acting abilities of just a few people. You will find everything you need to experience one meditation journey while watching this movie: A new life's beginning (unexpected just as it does happen), finding someone to be with, all the struggle to survive, and the final words.I invite you to trust your feelings and your heart should be your best critic - and not only while watching Passengers. Good luck!"
" The Vidiot Reviews...
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,5,"PassengersThe downside to hypersleep is lying in your own nocturnal emissions for 100 years.Smartly, the cyrosleeper in this sci-fi film wakes up to get his rocks off.When an asteroid strikes a spacecraft carrying thousands of hibernating colonists to their new home, slumbering passenger, Jim (Chris Pratt), is woken 90 years too soon.Unable to get back to sleep, or commandeer the controls, Jim's desperation results in him rousing a female passenger (Jennifer Lawrence) to keep him company. But when she learns the truth, his plans for love are jeopardized.Meanwhile, damage to the ship's reactor threatens all life aboard.With mediocre effects, dull performances and a stalker-like narrative masquerading as a love story, this ill-fated voyage distracts from its creepiness with a boilerplate climax that adds further insult to the viewer's intelligence.Besides, intercourse in space is the same as intercourse on Earth, just way more expensive.

" Basically a love movie disguised as science fiction.
",2017-03-10 00:00:00,5,"An incredibly good idea put into a horribly bad made movie.Despite the great performance by the actors, it's a movie more or less regular to bad in every other aspect. I'm a big fan of science fiction, specially when it's accurately realistic, none of which characteristics this movie has. I'd like to say it did not meet my expectations in any way; even after having seen every trailer I was not capable of seeing it coming.Cheers."
" Maybe not a Scifi classic..
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,7,"As a Scifi fan, this movie may not go down as a classic, but it still does a good job for what it is. Like many science fiction movies, you have to suspend some disbelief. Without going into spoilers, there are science/engineering related parts of this movie that may make trained engineers cringe. However, if you see this movie as more a message of hope for those in dark times, it does its job. It is also addresses some human issues, dealing with moral quandaries. It makes you ask yourself what would you do in a similar situation? Overall, this was entertaining and inspiring."
" Not as bad as the critics say
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,7,"Passengers stars Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence, they along with 5,000 others are currently en route to inhabit Planet Homestead II. Suddenly the corkscrewing vessel goes through an asteroid field shorting out his cryo-pod and waking him too early. He becomes distraught to discover he's got 90 years left of his journey. He eventually accepts his fate, but after a while he gets lonely to the brink of suicide. So after browsing through her video blogs, he decides to wake up Aurora played by Lawrence. Gradually as the film goes on they start falling for each other and by this point, it does start to feel like Titanic in space. Director Morten Tyldum does his best with Prometheus' John Spaihts script (which was on Hollywoods Blacklist for 10 years) He keeps the film eerie and atmospheric with the sterile lighting of the interior, and the sometimes haunting music score by Thomas Newman. It tones down on the overused comedic acting we are so accustomed to from the two lead actors, especially Pratt. There is some good chemistry between the two leads and the visual effects look great. However It does have its flaws, one being the fact that it lacks originality. It doesn't quite reach the tension levels of the films it's inspired by from Moon, The Shinning and Alien just to name a few. Martin Sheens android has a scene where he malfunctions which is very reminiscent to Alien. The obvious one of course is 2001: A Space Odyssey, from the rotating corridors and the overall set designs. The first half is great, the middle section is okay and the third act falls flat leaving you waiting for more as it wraps up too suddenly. Overall Passengers is a good way to pass 2 hours of your time."
" The starship excels, everything else fails
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,3,"This movie is another one of these modern movies I'd like to call ""designed lifestyle movies"". Take a sci-fi story, enough CGI and two popular actors and go ahead. Unfortunately, there are some other things like good script, logic, atmosphere and so on. The last one is where most of such movies fail. It takes almost two hours but in this case I'd preferred the usual 1.5 hours many US mainstream movies have, would have been enough.But it's not a demanding, sophisticated movie, there is no real good acting (Martin Sheen being the exception), no real suspension, no real catastrophe (in the end the ship is just all fine, as at the beginning of the journey), a way too simple script and a lame ending. Basically, just some simple and cheap entertainment, packed in a nice form and featuring two actors who have to drag the audience in. Most of them might ending up being quite disappointed and rightfully so.Either you make a real disaster, a psychological or a philosophical movie, but trying to mix them all up in one thin soup doesn't work out, and that's what we got here.But: the starship is really cool and closer to a real one than most others; might have been inspired by Stanislaw Lems ""Fiasko"" starship. And that's just about the best of the movie. So, enjoy the CGI views of the ship."
" Lovable, original with incredible sceneries
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,7,"This movie is worth looking for the scenery, for the original story (It starts of simply as a journey through space but the twists in the story: you never see them coming) and for the main characters, especially Jennifer Lawrence, Laurence Fishburn and android bartender Michael Sheen convert real characters. The characters show how you can make an interesting movie about caring characters that with only few means can entertain you if you want to look at an original love story in a spacial futuristic setting."
" Amazing

" Gravity scenes were excellent!!!
",2017-03-08 00:00:00,6,"A spaceship is traveling to Homestead II, a new planet and it transports over 5000 passengers on a journey that takes 120 years to complete. All the passengers and crew are in a separate sleep pod and due to some malfunction Jim wakes up and he finds out that 90 years is still remaining to reach the destination. The chemistry between Pratt and Lawrence is one of the key factor of the movie. The spaceship structure was also likable and got a fine music. The expectations will be high because of the cast and Morten Tyldum, the director of 'The Imitation Game'. The special effects and visuals keeps the movie interesting, especially the swimming pool scene. Overall, it's a watchable sci-fi movie and somehow I enjoyed it."
" Better than what the critics said (7.5/10)
",2017-03-08 00:00:00,8,"This movie currently has a 31% approval on Rotten Tomatoes and this was the reason I continued to delay watching this movie. After watching it, I completely disagree with the popular critic opinion. I felt this was a very entertaining movie with a charismatic lead pair and some good chemistry.We start off with Jim (Chris Pratt) whose hibernation pod has broken and he woke up 90 years too soon before the spaceship reaches its destination, a new earthlike habitable planet. This sets up an intriguing premise and I'm a sucker for movies where the main character is stranded in one location. Things start to get more interesting when Jennifer Lawrence's character makes an entrance, (who by the way looks stunning in every shot!)All in all, Passengers is a very well crafted film. The lead pair is what makes it work. The romance didn't feel forced or artificial. You actually buy that under those circumstances, both of the characters would fall in love. The third half is when things really start to come together and I was rooting for the lead pair to make it through the end. At a time when were are continuously bombarded with sequels and reboots, Passengers is a fresh change. It doesn't offer anything novel, but the premise and the lead pair make it worth a watch in my opinion."
" Would you sacrifice yourself to save another or bigger still, would you sacrifice another to save yourself?
",2017-03-08 00:00:00,7,"In this Morten Tyldum (The Imitation Game, Headhunters) directed film, written by Jon Spaihts (Prometheus, Doctor Strange), Chris Pratt (Guardians of the Galaxy, The Lego Movie) stars as Jim Preston, a mechanic travelling to the Homestead Colony, who is awakened 90 years early when a malfunction happens following a meteorite connecting to the hull of the spacecraft, the Avalon. No-one else is awake, including the crew, and the only company he has apart from the interactive consoles is android bartender Arthur (Michael Sheen: Underworld, The Damned United). After a year of trying to stay sane, his isolation causes him to obsess over one of the other sleeping passengers, Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence: Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle), a writer who is one of the gold passengers.Finally worn down over his moral dilemma, he wakes her up and claims that like him, her pod malfunctioned and they slowly get to know one another and begin to fall in love. A year later Arthur lets slip that Jim deliberately woke her from her pod and Aurora is so angry that she physically attacks him, but when Deck Officer Gus Mancuso's (Laurence Fishburne: The Matrix, Apocalypse Now) pod malfunctions causing him to wake too, they find out that there are failures in several of the systems. The spacecraft is at risk of blowing up and they must work together to save the 5,258 passengers.In this sci-fi romance don't expect high action even though it is set in space, it is a mix of drama, romance and human psychology. The acting was great and although there are only really four main actors, the movie did not feel empty of emotion. It felt very real in that could a person really resist temptation to wake another passenger up if that was the only way that he could get human interaction for the rest of his life? The journey left would take longer than he had to live and Jim could not just get back into the pod and go back to sleep again. But like Aurora says to Gus in the movie, waking her was essentially murder as she would never get to live the life she was supposed to because of his actions. This made the plot quite unique and although the ending let the film down, the stunning visuals and thought provoking dilemma of the main character held my attention throughout.The chemistry between Lawrence and Pratt worked well and Sheen made it easy to forget that he wasn't actually a robot. For me, the main enjoyment of the film was the moral complexity and the psychological aspect of the situation they find themselves in. Would you sacrifice yourself to save another or bigger still, would you sacrifice another to save yourself? As a side note, I think it is quite funny that Disney's Sleeping Beauty is also called Aurora and I am thinking that maybe this was a deliberate reference."

" A classic example of when a good scifi story gets butchered by Hollywood clichés
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,5,"(Taking a deep breath) Uff... Let me just start by saying I love sci-fi movies, I really do. From masterpieces (IMO) like ""Moon"", ""Interstellar"", ""Ex Machina"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Ghost in the shell ""to less ambitious but still amazing classics like the Riddick trilogy, the original ""Alien"" movies or the excellent ""Guardians of Galaxy"", I enjoy being drawn into these made up worlds of the future and presented with reality that may one day be our own. Yet sometimes, I get irritated and decide to write a review about a particular movie. It's a rare thing for me to be angry at a scifi movie and it only happens when a great premise gets butchered by the greed of Hollywood producers who do everything to lure the widest audience possible. So is the case with ""Passengers"". Without getting into much details, I had really high hopes for this movie- the story is truly intriguing and original, the star ship Avalon is really dope and the ever present feel of isolation the main protagonist experiences is very well presented. In short, the first half of the movie, the part where there is no action at all, is great. Then, Aurora shows up, a big romance and sudden break-up follows and... the ship starts to malfunction. Perhaps you, like me, had similar thoughts about what triggers the ship to go haywire. A black hole bends the fabric of space, an evil corporation is behind everything, maybe the whole journey is based on a broken promise and was doomed from the beginning. You would think there is a grander theme to all of this, a universal message that reflects our own society, a sudden plot twist that takes this movie into another direction. You get none of that. Instead, it turns out the ship has some bad engineering and the main characters are the only ones that could save the rest of the passengers. Or something like that, I gave up paying attention at this point. What matters is that we could have witnessed how the director of the movie paints a portrait of a human psyche when he introduces elements of Stockholm Syndrome, the negative effects interstellar travel puts on human brain and how isolation destroys someone's will to live. As an alternative, we got a microwaved soup of classic Hollywood clichés, one after another, the next one even more predictable that the previous. It's almost as if there was a different plot with a much better ending somewhere in the beginning of making of this movie, but a group of producers had a meeting where they all agreed ""Nah, the audience is not put to it, scratch it and give me some action! With semi-naked bodies, a lot of explosions and a clock ticking"". Screw you, we deserve better. Of course, there is time and place for pure action and laser beams flying off the screen, but when you promise a psychological sci-fi thriller in extremely cool setting, you keep that promise. I am maybe overreacting, but I feel like I've been back-stabbed. This film could have been so much more, but it seems as revenues mattered more than art. The ending is, well, acceptable, but I really hoped that after an hour of explosions I will at least get recompensed with a scene where the ship reaches its destination, or lack of if that would be the director's choice. Yet once again, no, we get this illogical premise that two people imprisoned in an enormous tin can heading to a destination they will never see can live and be happy ""Adam and Eve"" style for decades without any human interaction other than each other's company. I'll give them 10 years tops and they go mad. And it wouldn't be their fault, we are just not ""programmed"" to be alone. If that wasn't enough, we are constantly being mentally stimulated to scream ""That's ridiculous"" when the plot unfolds. To me, it was: 1. There are 5000 passengers on board the Avalon, all in cryosleep, monitored by an advanced computer AI that keeps them alive as they await the end of they voyage. There is nobody awake who checks if everything's OK, no plan to take turns and wake up for a little bit to monitor the journey's progress. Most of all, there is absolutely no plan B in case one of the pods malfunctions and wakes up its host. Nothing. Your pod was a lemon and you're screwed to the end of your days. Please. 2. When our lovely duet finds out that they can use the ""ultimate human fixing machine"" to go back to sleep, it turns out there's only one such robot aboard this ship. Only one. For 5000 passengers. You can't tell me it was too expensive to buy two for a ship this size and a distance that long. It's literally like having one lifeboat on a transatlantic cruise ship. 3. I always get frustrated when I see how inadequate security features are portrayed in movies that take place in the future. It's either a magnetic card, a stupid watch like id thingy or a fingerprint scanner. Really? My laptop has better security features than that. I really wanted to like this movie and I did, for the first half of it, but after that everything went downhill and I had to force myself to stay till the end. At one point, I was laughing when Chris Pratt character floated away in space and Aurora missed the cable that held him. I really wanted him to float back to Earth and save himself from being resurrected only to die of boredom 50 years later (or however long they lived). Sorry, to disappoint you if you didn't see the Spoiler alert and read this through. You should still see this movie and decide for yourself. In my opinion, it's a missed opportunity."
" An good sci-fi flick with some excellent special effects.
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,6,"Note that this contains spoilers. If you haven't watched the film, I suggest you do before reading this.The first hour or so of this film was fantastic. Just taking in the spacecraft with all its amazingly conceived features, was reminiscent of the first part of 2001: A Space Odyssey. It also struck me as being a realistic version of the type of spacecraft in Wall-E (think of the little cleaner droids, buzzing around, fixing things and cleaning the mess the characters make!) The premise of being alone on a vast, automated, self-repairing craft that is aware of your presence and provides all the conveniences you require, was an interesting concept. The technology and physics seemed plausible, cool, and realistic; and the special effects were restrained and effective. The robot bartender was fascinating, and provided some welcome entertainment.For the first hour the story seemed meaningful and thought-provoking, but after that it began to fall apart. A major aspect of the plot during the first half of the movie was being unable to get to the crews' quarters to wake them up, and the hopelessness of the situation because of this.Then, as if by magic, one of the crew wakes up, says there's something wrong with the ship, wanders around a bit, then dies. From then on it seemed to me like the script had been taken over by a different person, there to ensure the film served the public the usual smattering of sensationalist action scenes at expense of both the plot and plausibility of science. There is a brief promise of mystery as the trio realised there was something wrong with the ship and tried to figure out what it was, but this quickly evaporates as the problem turns out to be nothing more than a faulty nuclear reactor that is heading for self-destruction.The obvious thing to have done here would have been to wake more of the crew, now that they had access, to see what could be done. However, we are told there is not time for that, so the protagonist miraculously fixes the nuclear reactor all by himself. What a genius! This involved finding and hot-swapping a replacement circuit board, getting blasted into space, being spectacularly rescued by his female companion, dying, and finally brought back to life by having about a dozen or so different resuscitation techniques applied to him at once by a machine! Yeah. Face palm."
" Another dreary, unbearable story of 'emotions'
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,1,"This is just another movie about digging deep into someone's disturbed emotions.This flick is no exception. On a background of space colonization travel, it tells this boring story of 'highly' emotional people dealing with their emotions all the time. Any technical discomfort drives them further insane into their mental weakness. Sad, boring, stupid.If these kinds of clowns try to inhabit them poor other planets, then the 'emotional' individuals shall find themselves amidst the same dull, weak, boring problems that they tried to escape from. Besides, it is funny how colonists who should be a steadfast and resilient bunch actually need this space cruise ship with all the amenities! If they cannot travel in any conditions other than such as of a 5-star resort, then how would they survive the most likely hard and dangerous conditions of a faraway planet that needs to be colonized?Sad, boring, dull, stupid. Why do I ever watch such garbage anyway?"
" Movie was meh
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,5,"Movie was OK... but Jennifer Lawrence is hot in it. I mean the story was okay as far as chick flicks go, but it could have been so much better if it were just a straight science fiction movie. It really has so much more potential in it than what was used. Some parts were genuinely funny, some parts were heartwarming but it really just did not know what it wanted to be."
" A nonsensical, poorly written story with lots of holes
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,3,"This story has so many holes in it I could not get my head around it. Firstly, why would the company makes those incredibly elaborate billion dollar infrastructures AND maintain them for 120 years so that they are used for a meager 4 months!!!! It's nonsensical at best. It does not make any financial sense, especially for a private company looking to make profits.How could the food on board last for 120 years?!Where is the source of water and sunlight to turn the spaceship into an elaborate rainforest?! The passengers are supposed to be asleep for 120 years, so why on earth is the p.a. system announcing ""passengers please proceed to the viewing area to watch a star close up""???!!!Why does the Android suddenly reveals the secret?!There are also those lucky coincidences that are only there to take the story forward. Such as when the captain wakes up! Among 5000 passengers and crew the captain is the only person that happens to wake up!!!Poor job, very disappointing."
" Great film. Great Dilemma.
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,8,"I was astounding by the idea of this movie. Great script, excellent design of the ship and its interiors and amazing CGI exteriors.The plot: A space ship is heading to an earth-like planet with 5250 people on board in hyper-hibernation, in a voyage that will endure no less than 120 years. While en route, a gigantic meteor cloud of meteors smash onto the ship's protective shield without greater damage... only a little bit of stone is let thru against it. Some malfunction happens and one unlucky individual is prematurely awake from his hibernation deep sleep... when he knows that the ship is 90 years short to arrive to the new planet, he realizes he's doomed for good.This movie is good for a big audience followed by a debate on human emotions and choices. Selfishness or despair? The big question for the movie buff shall be this: What would YOU do? I was completely blown away by this movie. The purity and originality of the script, the gracious ideas in the spaceship, the small but cool action that will unravel as time unfolds and the sparse but vivid comedy in several moments makes this movie well above average.It is a film that makes us think ""what if""?"
" Logic is out the window. The entire premise is a practical joke.
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,3,"It's OK when a well-made science fiction movie requires the audience to take a leap of faith, especially when it's a space thriller. For example, most sci-fi fans take for granted concepts such as time-travel, hyper-space, FTL, wormholes, etc. As long as the story and characters are good, everything else is secondary and certain far-fetched ideas are acceptable. In this movie, the main premise is that a super-advanced, highly automated, human-made space ship transports people in stasis pods to a distant colony while traveling at half the speed of light, and the whole trip will take about 120 years. OK. Fine. This is the future, so we can accept that. The problem is that many of the events driving the story contradict that basic premise. 1. Transporting humans in stasis – that's the single most important function of the space ship. That's what it was made for. Well, it turns out that whoever designed the ship did not plan a fail-safe in case a stasis pod malfunctions. In fact, this incredibly advanced ship automatically comes to life when someone wakes up, and it can sense what a person wants to drink at the bar, or how they feel, but somehow the ship doesn't 'see' the bigger picture - that someone is awake 90 years too soon! And how do they explain this in the movie - ""The pods were not supposed to ever fail"". This is absurd. That would be like building a limousine with a bar and an entertainment center, that didn't come with an airbag because, well it's not supposed to ever crash. 2. Can't go back into stasis once you are awake. Yea sure, this ship - a feat of human engineering, whose main purpose is to transport people in stasis over vast distances over hundreds of years of flight time, does not have the capability of putting someone back into stasis. How is that nonsense explained in the movie – ""going into stasis is a very long and complicated process that requires special equipment, which is not available on this super-advanced ship"". Just to clarify, we are supposed to believe that letting someone go back into stasis is MORE complicated than building a ship that can travel at 50% the speed of light, that can automatically sense incoming asteroids and divert power to the main shield to protect itself, and that can slingshot itself around a red giant star while withstanding super-hot temperatures. But putting people back to sleep well that's just way too complicated, so to hell with it. If someone wakes up tough luck. 3. But wait, it turns out later that that's not entirely true. There is one automated medical pod that can possibly put a person into stasis. HUH? Wait, so it CAN be done after all? Why didn't they engineer that capability in all the stasis pods? And was there really a SINGLE med pod on the entire ship supporting 5000 people? What about spares? What if that med pod malfunctioned? LOL! It turns out that ship was only advanced in certain aspects, but it's really crappy when it comes to preserving human life. The writers basically wrote themselves into a whole, piling up ridiculous explanations as to why only one person on the entire ship could go back into stasis, but two people couldn't. Very weak.4. The stasis pods can actually kill someone in a slow and agonizing way, by inducing hundreds of life-threatening conditions AT THE SAME TIME. Fantastic! I thought the ship was designed to recognize a pod malfunction and interrupt the stasis BEFORE a person is killed or severely harmed. 5. The flight crew are never awoken, even when critical systems start to fail. So, basically, this ship was designed, so that everyone will either reach the destination, OR everyone will die in their sleep. No matter how bad things get, and how necessary the engineering crew is, there are no fail-safe systems to wake up the people who can actually fix stuff. The only time anyone is pulled out of stasis is when their individual pod malfunctions. Obviously the ship couldn't repair itself without human intervention, so why wasn't human intervention pre-programmed as a response to major breakage? Why would anyone go into this flying death trap? Ridiculous. Now, about some of the decision making by the three passengers. 6. Why didn't Gus take the pain meds knowing that he had to survive for as long as possible to repair the ship, and why did he later regret not taking them, right before he died? Just another stupidity that remained unexplained. 7. Oh, and when the ship was about to fail completely, why did the two protagonists stop by the bar to deactivate Arthur? For some reason they decided that fixing the android bartender was more important than saving the ship and everyone on it. These two deserved to die just for that stupidity.8. And more when they searched the main engineering section for ""something broken"", the guy said that it would take too long to wake up the crew. So, somehow he came to the conclusion that it would be faster for two unqualified passengers to troubleshoot and fix a super-advanced space ship, than to wake up a crew of engineers whose job was to fix the ship? W.T.F.! They should have woken people up the minute they saw flames in the engine chamber, or even sooner. Am I overthinking these things? How do I leave my brain by the door before watching a movie? In some scifi movies the 'science' part is supposed to be ignored to some extent, but this is not one of them because the whole story revolves around the science aspects of the ship, many of which make no sense. FAIL. 3 stars for the special effects."
" Stunning!
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,10,"With so many disappointing scifi movies around, this lovely film was a surprising find that went against the norm. I was engrossed by the cinematography and the stunning visual effects. Every aspect of the film was enjoyable -- the engaging story, the poignant music, and the very credible acting. I was completely prepared for this movie to have an unsatisfying ending, but it surprised me. I highly recommend it to all lovers of scifi and outer space films."
" Entertaining, but not very deep
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,7,"Once you've seen the trailer, you pretty much have seen the movie. The rest is individual acting from Pratt and Lawrence and some special effects. I liked both. Unfortunately, that's as deep as it goes. It's pretty obvious that some exec greenlit an elevator pitch like ""Moon, but with two hot and famous people that have a fling"". I was expecting some sort of twist at the end, but there wasn't any.Bottom line: straight forward movie, touching lightly on some moral and emotional issues, but failing to take it any further. My wife thought it was boring. I kind of liked it, but frankly I liked Michael Sheen the most out of the entire film."
" Better than Expected, in Unexpected Ways
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,7,"After seeing many lukewarm or negative reviews, I watched Passengers with low expectations. Having seen it, I'm aware of its logical shortcomings. But overall, I liked it a lot - for reasons I really never expected.At its core, this is not an adventure - it's a very unusual love story. It's about a love born of disaster, desperation and even heinous selfishness. And yet, it's a love that we come to appreciate as the story slowly unfolds. This film works remarkably well on a dramatic level. The two stars are extremely likable, and do a fine job of presenting a wide range of emotions, despite the limited scope of the story. (There are also a few smaller parts that work very well - notably the mechanized bartender.)Even more surprisingly, Passengers succeeds in evoking that bona fide SF 'sense of wonder,' as we contemplate the lives of two people living alone on a huge starship, while 5,000 others remain inaccessible in hibernation. It's a fascinating vision, depicted quite powerfully.On a purely mechanical level, the results are somewhat more mixed. The film does look terrific. The starship is elegant and believable. But the film's respect for real-world physics, on the other hand, hits both highs and lows.On the up side, there are several maneuvers in zero gravity that are really quite clever, handled infinitely better than we've seen in such critically-acclaimed dreck as Gravity (which also lacked the powerful emotional side of Passengers). On the down side, we have a ship that loses centrifugal gravity by suddenly ceasing to spin. Not only is there no reason for it to stop spinning, we don't see the horrible carnage that inertia would create inside the ship after a sudden stop. There's also a scene with fusion plasma that's needlessly implausible, not so much because of poor physics, as because of lazy writing.On balance, however, the scientific underpinnings are more than adequate to carry the film's genuinely compelling drama. Ignore the few inevitable quibbles, and Passnegers works really well as both SF and romance. It leaves you with some novel insights into human nature, and a genuinely haunting central image.I have to deduct a point or two on the technical side, but even so I give the film a very strong recommendation. It's entertaining, likable and thought-provoking, and I will definitely watch it again."
" Not Bad, But Not Great
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,6,"Three things about how I review...1) I'm okay with fantasy. I'll be lenient on a movie if it lacks realism. After all, it is a movie.2) I'm a sucker for romance.3) Storyline, dialog, and editing are key for me. They are the backbone for any movie.I'm not a hater. I'm not criticizing this movie, but I'm also not praising it either.I really wanted to like this movie, because it has a lot of potential on the surface - Chris Pratt, Jennifer Lawrence, Sci-Fi, and Romance.But... I realize what it is... We weren't given enough to support the story line, and as much as I wanted Jennifer to deliver, her dialog and direction was just... off.There were a few zingers that in some cases exposed her slight tendency to overact. This, is not entirely her fault. Directors are responsible for getting the actor to sell the scene, but in some instances, you can almost see where Jennifer is almost forcing her lines and emotions. I know she is capable of not doing this, as you can see in Silver Lining. The hard thing is that we don't see the directors directing in a scene. When you see what she has done in the past, versus in Passengers, you can tell the difference in how she was being directed.I think this affected Chris as well. I'm one of his biggest fans, especially in Parks and Recreation. But, there are some subtle moments where he appears to have delivered a line multiple times (aka takes).This definitely had all the right ingredients. It's just the cook (director), didn't make his best dish with what he had to work with."
" Visually stunning in 3D
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,8,"Passenger is visually stunning movie and it is directed well too. The biggest problem is script. It is too predictable. Even so the movie is staggering beautiful to watch. Especially 3D looks great and is worth of a movie ticket. Directing is solid and expertise. At the beginning of the movie Chris Pratt is acting well as a lonely passenger. Romance at the movie is plausible and Jennifer Lawrence proves to be a great actress. Passengers is not the best sci-fi movie I have seen, but it also won't be worst. It is one of the best sci-fi movies a long time ant it's visuality is worth to see.Passengers plot is well done and it works all audience. It is some kind of Titanic in space. Little bit more drama and it would be perfect movie. Story is quote light but the way it has been done is well worth a movie ticket. It is best to watch in 3D from a big screen, visuality of it is the best in this movie."
" Good watch.
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,7,"A spaceship on a 120 year voyage to a planet like earth transporting 5000+ people for a new beginning with one person awake from hibernation with 90 more years to go. Well this movie has it all, it has technology, it has a story, it has romance, it has trouble, it has a suspense. A win win combination. I was thrilled to see the Science and technology in this movie, a star ship which has all the facilities like a cruise liner. The efforts put in this movie are tremendous and are well seen. A pretty movie for both Sci-Fi and Romantic fans. The only thing that bugged me was its ending. The movie was great but in my opinion it should've had a better climax. Its the unsatisfying climax that lead to critics disliking the movie. I am not criticizing its just what I think. Otherwise Chris and JLaw were fab! Not to forget Michael Sheen too."
" Gold and Greens and explosions of Red
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,10,"This has been a welcome surprise !The story have a couple of very soft turns and a terrible bad and inappropriate final song in the end credits, but it worth the journey.It puts so many questions on the table, the right to say ""no"" which is a very actual issue. How the decisions and acts of others affect us. Really the same way weather or natural phenomena affects us. But in the second case we don't personalized, but if we stop personalizing and accept what we can't change independently how was originated, we have peace of mind and we are in better position for take better decisions who can improve our conditions. What is time and what is really a prison. We create the prison inside us and after that, everything outside seems like a prison to us, no matter if we are in a open paradise.The interpretations are so good, Jennifer Lawrence is a hell of an actress!And the whole movie is gold and green with some very clever placed explosions of red. So beautiful to watch!!!!!!Great work if someone ask me!!!"
" Computers don't leave space for heroes
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,7,"A man awakes from cryogenic sleep on a flight to a distant planet. He is faced with being alone for the rest of his life unless he can find a way to get back to sleep.I must admit I went in to this with some preconceptions, asuming it would target a young female audience. I was pleasantly surprised.The story is very simple, don't expect too much in the way of plot twists, this is mainly about how the characters deal with their situation.As the title suggest -and the characters admit- on a fully automated system human beings really are just passengers. Chris Pratt's contribution to the problem is solved in my house by a small, wooden wedge. The writers, not daring to have a passive female character, give Jennifer Lawrence a ridiculous task that could have been better accomplished by a well trained labrador.The affects are good, the story is OK but is padded out to fill the time. But it was done well and I enjoyed this.It may have been a nice change to make Jenifer the engineer and change the roles up a bit - I expect the writers were afraid that a female audience wouldn't stomach a sulky Chris Pratt."
" Incredible Movie!
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,10,"Now ranking as one of my favourite films, Passengers is a well-produced and directed movie, with incredible imagery, filming technique and story-line. Some of its final moments reminded me of the movie ""Titanic"", which even though they had a decently happy ending, it was still quite sad because they couldn't achieve their dream of being together on the planet, but every movie needs a scene that really gets to you and sticks with you to be remembered and loved by the viewers. My compliments to the producers and actors!"
" I can't believe the critics!
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,8,"First,let me say this.Don't believe the critics.They're insanely wrong.This movie is really good and definitely worth watching!!About the movie.It's well paced and have quite an intriguing plot.The action scene is tight and intense.And it all seem so real.I really would have made the same decisions as they did.Just go see it!"
" Very Solid and Entertaining Sci-Fi Movie
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,8,"Okay, I heard several critics kind of pan this movie but I disagree. We really enjoyed it and Chris Pratt and Jenniffer Lawrence are really believable as lovers and a couple in love. The plot was intriguing and loved the bartender. The ending felt a tad cut short but there is a scene where Chris Pratt puts on his space suit to try to fix the ship. Jennifer Lawrence is bawling her eyes out telling him to come back safe and it was just very real looking and feeling. I see why she is an A list actress. The ship is really cool and the Sci Fi concepts are neat too. Go see it. Solid and entertaining with good acting."
" Boring
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,1,"First 20-30 minutes was good, rest of the movie was boring. Atmosphere drawn to movie in the beginning but probably if the bartender was not being in the movie I can not finish this. Because there is no real drama or romance. Movie was not short but incidents was too fast. For example I never felt Jim spend a year alone."
" What a terrific surprise
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Passengers"" (2016) has to be one of the best guilty pleasure movies I've ever seen. I can understand why it got so many negative reviews from critics and viewers, and you kinda have to leave your believes behind the door when you will watch this movie, because there are some ""how can that be?"" moments in this movie, but they are far and in between for a what beautiful, original (!) are simply great this movie is. The premise is original, and kinda fresh (and this goes from a Sci-Fi movie buff). Acting was very good by all (i won't spoil how many faces) involved. Script as well directing was very involving - at running time almost 2 hours i was engaged into this story more that i could have possibly imagined at the beginning. Overall, ""Passengers"" is a terrific Sci-Fi entertainment. Its not a very deep on its core (aka Interstellar), but it delivers on a most important thing - to like a movie very much do to its involvement in a story. This one truly delivers a great, great guilty pleasure."
" Enjoyable, but not exceptional
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,5,"If you are thinking about watching this movie there are at least two things you should keep in mind. 1) This is not an action movie. There is some action in it, but most of the movie is entirely devoid of suspense.2) The thing that was advertised as a huge twist in the trailers turns out to not be much of a twist at all and is instead a pretty logical progression of the plot which you will no doubt predict before it happens.(In other words: the trailer kind of sucked. Or maybe it was a great trailer, since studios seem to care more about getting your respective butt in their seats than having you actually enjoy their content)In any case, I still found it very enjoyable. It wasn't the most inventive story ever, but it was a sweet tale about humanity's need for companionship with a robot (always a plus),some fun futuristic ship design, some action, some drama, some beautiful visuals of space and some enjoyably questionable gravitational shenanigans. Jennifer Laurence is pretty great (as is the norm) and Chris Pratt's performance is good (I think), although it is kind of a different type of role from what he's known for being cast as (it's almost a bit strange seeing him this reserved).The movie definitely exceeded my expectation, but keep in mind that I personally adore sci-fi and that I put a lot of weight on visuals."
" Passable, if forgettable
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,5,"Some of the greatest science-fiction films ever made are creepily prophetic, depicting a not-too-distant future in which technology has become a necessity rather than a luxury. The characters in Morten Tyldum's Passengers are in the middle of an intergalactic journey to another planet, with Earth now seemingly picked clean of all of its natural energy and resources. While this somewhat terrifying idea may seem unlikely (or maybe I'm giving humanity too much credit), the technology on board the starship Avalon, such an electronic meal dispenser and the android bartender, could very well happen tomorrow in our increasingly tech-reliant times. Passengers does well in setting up some big ideas, before descending into a tonally-uneven rom-com-cum-disaster movie.Along with 5,000 others, mechanical engineer Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) is on his way to Homestead II, a newly-established colony for humans rich or skilled enough to earn their place. 30 years into a 120-year journey, the Avalon is struck by a meteor shower which causes parts of the ship to malfunction. While the ship is highly capable of repairing the damages, Jim's hibernation pod glitches and opens 80 years too early. At first, he believes that he has a month of luxury and socialising to enjoy before arriving at his destination, before he is hit with the realisation that he is the only one awake, and will die of old age long before any of the other crew members will wake up. Spending his time trying to break into the ship's control room and drinking his sorrows away with android Arthur (Michael Sheen), he spots sleeping beauty Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence) and starts to fall in love with her video profile.After an entire year alone, Jim makes the decision to wake her up, essentially condemning her to die with him. She is naturally devastated at first, but hits it off with the charming and handsome Jim, who has convinced her that she was awoken due to a ship malfunction also. Aurora is also a gold-star member, which means that she has access to lattes and bacon while the working-class Jim has been enduring instant coffee and porridge. A happily-ever-after space romance would not make for a very interesting movie, so the couple are torn apart when the Avalon starts to experience some serious hitches and Arthur blurts out the truth to Aurora. With the ship going haywire, Chief Deck Officer Gus (Laurence Fishburne) is also woken up prematurely, and it doesn't take him long to realise that the ship is overloaded with trying to fix the multiple problems caused by the meteor shower two years earlier, and may not last much longer.While establishing itself early on as a character study asking some interesting questions and teasing us with the idea that our protagonist is in fact not the dashing charmer one has come to expect of Pratt, but a morally-conflicted creep, Passengers becomes eager to please the wider audience. Essentially turning into a formulaic love story with some generic action thrills, the film manages to get by on the strength of its two highly charismatic leads. While its clear they are pretty much playing themselves, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, and the two certainly have chemistry to burn and enough screen presence to dismiss the need for the CGI thrills that follow. It received a rather unfair roasting from the critics, but perhaps they were (understandably) expecting much more from what is an enticing set-up that ultimately chickens-out of its potential. I went in expecting mediocrity, but what I got was passable, if forgettable."
" Uplifting
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,10,"A successful movie, like any form of art, is one that gets an emotional response from the audience, and Passengers does that very competently.Even though the long space travel time in such a distant future seems a bit romantic it's not a deal breaker for the immersion experience that a movie is supposed to be.I've once read a quote from some director on what's the secret to a good movie: ""good actors"", he said. Jennifer Lawrence makes me wonder how someone so breathtakingly beautiful can be so incredibly talented, probably her best acting so far that I've seen.The special effects are absolutely amazing, the swimming pool scene (that's also in the trailer) is one of the most incredible CGI scenes I've ever seen, maybe not so much for the technical part but for the idea itself.Like others said, it's more of a love story than a sci-fi flick, and honestly I did not see that coming, but I thought it was brilliantly executed and there's little I could have wished for to make it better.It's funny how I'm usually anticipating movie plots while watching them, often bored and disappointed. During this movie I was *hoping* for the plot to unravel like I was predicting and cheering when it did. Not many movies did that for me."
" It was/is very awesome
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,10,"This move made me feel everything was happening with the actors. I was wandering if i could survive alone 1 year and what i could do to have fun. The actors are playing very, very good especially Jennifer Lawrence who impressed me from Hunger Games. The story is interesting and original. At the final of the movie i didn't cry but i was in that sad mood thinking what i will do now, like something inside of me was missing. The feeling are real. The story is good. What else do you need? This movie deserve to win the Oscar and other big prizes. This is one of the best movie i'v seen this year. Have a nice year! May be spoiler: I like the ending, but is was a little not on my taste. Anyway i didn't want the movie to end so..It was better if they made them go to hibernation and wake up on Homestead II enjoying the new life there. But still a great movie. Congratulation to the ones who made it!"
" Excellent....
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,8,"My wife and I sat and watched this one and we were both impressed. I have become rather jaded with regards to Hollywood productions, so I was pleasantly surprised by Passengers. Its a simple adaptation of a Robinson Crusoe style epic with a space setting and a romantic twist. Its a combination that works exceedingly well, aided by very down to earth scripting and narrative and strong characterization.Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt's chemistry is wonderful. It sparkles and bring this film to life with emotional and funny moments that work well, alongside some well timed action. All in all there is a heck of a lot to like here and little to criticize, aside from a slightly weak ending. Eight out of ten from me."
" Robinson Crusoe in deep space
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,7,"i have to say that i quite enjoyed watching this movie it's very similar to a Robinson Crusoe story just the story isn't settled on an island but in deep space. Cris Prat woke up during a space travel where it was supposed sleeping for 90 years..and since it's the only one awake it's trying to survive in solitude. I don't want to spoiler too much let's say that this movie could be considered a romantic sci fi story with some action linked to the spaceship problems and in some cases it's reminded me a bit Dawson Creek series where the two fiancé arguing..that's the part i enjoyed less i have to say. The movie it's well directed and in some cases there are shots that reminded my the film Moon. Great vfx and a great and really believable cast if you consider that all the movie it's based on less than five actors. So if you are looking for a truly sci fi movie or an action movie ..this one isn't fit the role, if you are looking to a sci fi /drama/ romantic/action movie so i would say something particular, you can enjoy this one, maybe if you are with your fiancé too. But do not considering to watch what a great movie let's say it's enjoyable without thinking to much but taking as it is 2 hours of entertainment"
" Don't watch it for the sci-fi, watch it for the relationship drama...
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,7,"...and existential questions. The idea for this movie is really intriguing. You can't help but ask yourself ""what would you do in such a situation"". The end was quite horrible to watch, as it was absurdly cheesy: our main hero being the Hollywood hero- all Armageddon style, the unnecessary black guy, who's there to give them the magical key, die and be there just for racial diversity. But there are some really important messages here. First, it shows us a typical marriage, that on earth would end up in divorce, but in space you have no other choice. After Aurora realizes, that Jim is the one who woke her up, she yells at him how he ruined her life. That's not love and that just sounds like a typical divorce story, where one partner thinks he gave up his ambitions and dreams just to be stuck with one person for the rest of his life and feels like he can't change anything about it. It's actually beautiful how realistic this part of the story was. Also, in the end Aurora didn't finally realize, that she really loves Jim, she just realized, that she doesn't want to be alone! She's scared, like anybody else and would rather try to live some sort of compromised life with that person, than to be all alone. Sadly, the writers took it here in a different direction and went all birds and trees and sacrificing hero stories. This movie isn't as stupid and shallow as it seems. Also, there's the problem, that most of the people nowadays have- thinking that they will finally be happy when they reach some specific goal, but when they do it, they're still not happy. And also the universal saying about the green grass in other people's yards (other planets). Aurora is that kind of person. All ambition and no satisfaction. And on this ship she learned to just go along with what life gives to you and make the best of it. It would have been more interesting, if they woke up some more people. Maybe a doctor, with the hope that he could put them to hibernation or something. Or just some other playmates. So what would you do in Jim's situation? ;) I would probably try to meditate and then wake up about 5 people, start a space civilization and stuff :D"
" A sympathetic tale set in space
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,7,"Although Passengers contain a few plot holes, the visuals, acting and especially the atmosphere (or lack thereof) made for a very sympathetic movie experience.The chemistry between Jennifer Lawrence's Aurora and Chris Pratt's Jim was strong so when the inevitable happened, the viewers could do nothing except to sympathize for the both of them. Using this idea, I was very hooked onto their relationship and the somewhat unconvincing plot.Overall, Passengers is a film with good visuals and chemistry between the protagonists but offer little in the way of plot."
" Don't trust Critics for this movie
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,9,"Metacritic score is too low, do not let this fool you. This is an excellent sci-fi movie which really tries to explore the minds of the people who can be very alone in space. The setup of the movie was just too gorgeous, nice CGI effect, nice AI infrastructures. The writers thought about many little aspects of that universe, like how everything goes on, what is the social norm, how different technologies are in everyday use and so on. I hope these thinking will be found in other sci-fi movies. This movie has only two main characters, Chris Patt and Jeniffer Lawrance, and I think both were superb in this movie. Especially, the way Jeniffer showed different kinds of expressions, was actually praiseworthy.This movie had many great moments. The buildup of the relation between Chris and Jeniffer was not hurried, where other movies use too much kissing scenes to show their love for each other (Remember Hacksaw Ridge?). I loved this movie. When you watch a sci-fi movie, you more or less can guess what gonna happen at last, but still, I found the ending as a good one. I remember Martians, Interstellar, Gravity, etc., these movies had pacing issues, had less developed characters, and so on. Comparing to those, this is an excellent movie. I don't get the critics, they praise Moonlight (which is boring like hell) but don't praise such excellent movie. You got to see this movie if you are a Sci-fi fan."
" Passengers is fantastic
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,9,"One of the best Movies in this category ! Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt acting like a Pro ! The movie is definitely worth your time,Ignore the critics they are really stupids. Professional film critics are stupid that's is my conclusion after watching this movie, so go watch this movie and decide for yourself how really stupid the film critics and haters are"
" Amazing production design that captivates the imagination
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,9,"Ill start out with the negative, because I can sort of understand why it didn't get great reviews. Critics tend to look more at story than anything else, followed by acting. I think this movie has a great story at it's core, but It's a simple story, and not terribly original. It also gets very cheesy cliché Hollywood toward the end. It's very predictable and there are really no surprises. That is a shame, because the movie really is amazing and it would be cool if it had a more creative story to match.The pace starts slow, and stays slow throughout most of the movie. It feels very reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey in many ways. If the story ventured into more creative territory instead of going for the cliché Hollywood ending, it would be very comparable to Kubrick's masterpiece in many ways.While I like a lot about this movie, the thing that stood out the most to me is the production design. The spaceship is SOOO COOL looking. There is a lot of attention to detail and it all feels very realistic. For a lover of Sci-Fi like me, it really captivates my imagination and stuck with me. The ship has a very cool design and seems well thought through. We get to really explore every part of the ship and get to know it like its a character of the film. This alone makes this movie great in my opinion. Next thing to applaud is the CGI. Everything looks so good, so clean, and very real to me. Visually, this film really nailed it in my opinion. The anti-gravity scenes are very cool and the space-suit scenes are very cool also. It's a film that can appeal to a person of any age for this reason. It doesn't really need to rely on an amazing story to be great because the concept and design of the ship is so fun to watch and explore. The cinematography was very beautiful also. There are some very iconic looking shots and the camera work and lighting is wonderful, reminding me again of Stanley Kubrick's films. I will have to watch it again to comment on the sound design, film score, and editing, but I would say that all the technical work on this film seemed really great.Chris Pratt is always fun to watch and full of charisma. A good portion of the film it is just him alone on the ship, so with a boring actor, it could be very painfully at times, but he keeps it fun and entertaining. I didn't really think that Pratt and Lawrence had all that much chemistry, but it works okay. Her character didn't seem very well developed, and I wasn't really sure if I even liked her character.Overall, I really loved this movie, despite it's flaws. It's the type of film that I will want to own on Blu-ray and put on frequently just to admire the cool shots and concept of the film. I have been day-dreaming about this movie since I saw it, as it provokes other thoughts of space travel and the future. If you love Sci-Fi, I would think that you will really love this movie."
" Mash up of many other, better, sci-fi and no sci-fi films
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,3,"This film was disappointing. I was only expecting some fun, I hardly even got fun. Let alone sci-fi inaccuracies and way exceeding suspension of disbelief. Sci-fi can be very intelligent, I found this film was only dumb covered with dollars. It did seem to get promisingly interesting at one point, when questions about what being alone and isolated may mean, but that never got too far. I am surprised so many people have given such good ratings. I guess if you really are in such a hurry you cannot take the time to watch Titanic, Wall-E, The Shining, The Martian, Castaway, you may as well make everything blend into Passengers and consider yourself well served."
" A glitch in space
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,5,"Passengers has great special effects, production design but the interesting and intriguing premise of the plot is squandered.Set in the future, an intergalactic spacecraft is taking a 120 year voyage to another planet to be colonised by five thousand volunteers who are in hibernation.Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) a mechanical engineer is woken up and thinks the ship has got near the planet. What he finds instead that he is alone and no one else is awake. He cannot get back to his pod and go back to hibernation. He has the ship at his disposal but as he was not a premium passenger he cannot get the premium services such as a better breakfast. His only companion is the android bartender on duty.After a year, his biological needs gets the better of him and when he sees a beautiful woman in a pod he deliberately wakes her up. She is Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence) a journalist and Preston tells her that like him she has woken up due to a malfunction.Of course he has committed an immoral act by waking her up and she will not be able to get back to hibernation. Aurora will die in this ship before the journey ends.Pretty soon both of them fall in love, well there is no one else in the ship besides the android bartender and the robo-vacuum cleaners. The film takes a turn when Aurora finds out the truth and it simply becomes a domestic drama of two people with irreconcilable differences.The last act of the film concerns the pair investigating the increased glitches in the ship, what is causing it and how to fix it. The film is a mash up of different genres and it loses its way a bit.It also has a strange vision of corporate space colonisation. While Preston is an economy class passenger Aurora is a premium class one. She has a better breakfast when she is awoken but there is no reason for it when the passengers are going to be in long term hibernation apart from the last few months of the journey. When Preston tries to send a distress message back to earth, the message will take years to get back to earth and he is charged a fortune for it. Who will collect the money and how?"
" Something new , creative and exciting
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,10,"If you are looking for a new , creative , lovely , well played movie this is the one. These days all movies are the same (combining good guys bad guys with drama plus magic or vampires or family drama , shootings , explosions and sometimes all combined !!) and once in a long while may something like this come : A movie with a brand new story line like none before as Matrix as cast away as Terminal ... I know we may see or hears similar stories BUT the way these creative movies are ... They are unique - This is unique - watch it :)"
" beautiful visual, a better love story than twilight.
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,9,"I don't know why so many people including those ""professional"" critics hates this movie. Chris and JLaw delivered a decent acting as usual, the story was simple and refreshing, no alien s**t attacking the ship, it also got me thinking ""what if I was Jim? what would I do to keep on living?""Everything was so enjoyable that I didn't realize two hours has passed and I'm actually hoping for a sequel about the life of the rest of the passengers in Homestead II. It was amazing. I'd totally watch this again."
" Microwaved Science Fiction
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,5,"This film is like microwaved science fiction, it has all the ingredients to be great but is overall very dull and laking taste. From very early on in the film it is quite clear what is going to happen, the story is very predictable and doesn't surprise ever. To me this film is no more than a follower of the science fiction trend we have seen over the past years (Gravity, Interstellar and so on) It does not give you an original story nor does have any mystery or suspense. It just doesn't deliver that intriguing and dark vibe that science fiction lovers such as myself really need. Knowing this will not be watched only by die hard science fiction fans, it will probably entertain most people. The visuals are good (although a bit too polished for my personal taste) the acting is good enough and the story makes sense, there are no obvious plot holes or anything. And of course Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence will make a lot of people want to see this. In the end, I think most people are going to like this. But if you are a science fiction lover don't bother."
" I didn't expected to be so good
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,10,"I didn't expect that a movie like this, closed between some rooms to be so good. I have to admit I was surprise in good way and this was by far the best movie i ever seen in a while, and the best romance movie too. Thankyou for making this movie and I can say that it changed my life, it made me see life in whole new good perspective. I hope others feel the same about it."
" Putting the awe back into awful movies
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,3,"Nobody does garbage like Hollywood. Except maybe Bollywood. Anyway, this film has Chris Pratt in it, so if you are not expecting plot holes large enough to fly interstellar spacecraft through, lower your expectations and leave your brain at the door when you go to see this film. On the plus side, the sfx are great. The craft looks real inside and out. The ship design doesn't really make sense but the filmmakers don't bother explaining anything anyway. So this isn't really science fiction, it is just fiction which happens to occur in space.As for spoilers, if you saw the trailer or the actors doing the rounds of the talk shows you knew that more than one person appears in this film. The protagonists, played by Pratt and Lawrence are on a ship with 5000 others heading to a distant planet. They are meant to hibernate for 120 odd years for the journey, but something goes wrong and they wake up. What happens next is where the hint of originality evaporates from this film. Basically from the moment Lawrence appears on screen, you can predict almost every event that is to come. The only exception is the appearance of Laurence Fishburne, but oh dear the protagonists forget to ask him how to wake up the crew and are left on their own to deal with the ""drama"" in the most clichéd ways the scriptwriters could imagine. This is Hollywood at its most self indulgent, the manufactured drama being so predictable it is just boring. The final act is supposed to be suspenseful but we have seen this kind of paint by numbers cinema before.So, if you are like the protagonists and have just spent 120 years in hibernation, this film will be a thrilling experience filled with exciting twists and suspenseful turns. For anybody with the desire to not have their intelligence insulted this is just another big budget low effort mountain of crap that you can avoid and miss out on nothing."
" 5 Stars because there's nothing WRONG with this movie but it's not fantastic either.
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,5,"NB: NO real spoilers - I'm sure the trailer shows what I'm saying...I love Sci Fi and so I may be giving this movie more credit than it deserves. I love ANY Sci-Fi movie that has beautiful space cinematography and this one has that :)Like my summary says, there's really nothing wrong with this film. although I do have some gripes:There's just not enough 'umph'.... I never felt any real dread or fear and nor was there any REAL surprises.... The characters were well developed enough but the rest was predictable...Major gripes: Slingshot maneuver was ridiculously close to the sun... movies have some common sense responsibilities, like not showing dangerous first aid practices (without identifying them as flawed), yet, in this movie, like so many others, I keep seeing people pull OUT objects that have punctured their bodies while there's either no medical professionals around or without some way to plug the wound or in most cases, NEITHER.... Makes me very angry. KIDS, YOU NEVER REMOVE AN OBJECT FROM A PUNCTURE WOUND UNLESS YOU HAVE A DOCTOR TELLING YOU TO DO IT (THE FOREIGN OBJECT MIGHT BE HOLDING YOUR BLOOD OR OTHER VITAL STUFF IN PLACE!)....Other than those, here is a BEAUTIFUL and fun little Sci-Fi film that I enjoyed for the moment."
" passengers
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,9,excellent movie&amazing soundtrack! great playing of Jennifer and Chris! the visual views and the effects was very beautiful the most wonderful movie that i seeing recently! well-done! hope to see passengers 2 in next year. worth every second of watching that again i'm sure that the director will think of something...!
" We'd all do the same thing
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,7,"So apparently a lot of people were SO offended by what's going on in this movie. Some said that 'it's not stalking if he's hot'. Looks like they missed out on some things in life, to say the least. This one is actually a no-brainer: no, it's not stalking if he's hot, well, let's say in 99% of cases. The thing is, this is how courting works. A guy who's interested in you tries to get your attention. At first you may not like him, and it doesn't matter if he's objectively attractive or not (here the critics of the movie claim that Chris Pratt is hot to everyone, which is definitely not true, so that kind of renders their argument void), but then you get to know him and you see that he's actually cool so you change your mind about him. Oh, and sometimes the guy may even be the total opposite of your type but he won't leave you alone, and you hate him for it, and then somehow as if magically he manages to make you fall in love with him. I'm sure everyone knows a story like that or two. But that's not what happens in this movie because here the characters are clearly into each other. So enough of the Stockholm Syndrome whining because 'Passengers' doesn't deserve all the hate. And yes, I'm a woman. But I grew up before people started going crazy about all this feminist/sexist/misogynist/chauvinist/perverse/stalker stuff that most of the time they only pretend to understand.There, I got it out of my system. Now on to the review. I give this movie a solid 7 for being a warm, pretty love story. I didn't expect it to be some great sci fi flick so I didn't feel cheated when it turned out to be a romantic drama. The story could've been a bit more fleshed out because there was potential there, and then, with all the special effects, it would've been amazing. I thought for a moment that this could be like 'Titanic' in space, but there wasn't enough substance. Still, the movie is interesting and definitely worth a watch. And even though we don't really see how hard life was on the ship for Jim when he was alone, we can infer enough from what we do see. And anyone who's seen 'The Martian' or 'Moon' can compare and imagine what it's like to be alone, having no one to talk to and nothing to do. What do you do once you've played a little basketball and done a little dancing? What is Jim supposed to be doing for the next 90 years? What reason could he possibly have to go on living? The movie does show very well how bad he feels when he has to wake Aurora up, and she does hate him, and that part of the story is pretty damn straightforward: he stole her life from her, sort of murdered her. But perhaps these two were meant to meet like that and make the most of what they got. If he didn't wake her up, their lives wouldn't be the same. And I don't think any of this needs explaining, really. When you watch the movie, you can understand all the human reasons for why they do what they do - why he doesn't want to live anymore, why he wakes her, why they fall in love, why she hates him but then forgives him. Seriously, this is so plain and simple. Like I said in the title of this review: we'd all do the same thing. Just imagine living alone in a place like this for a MONTH. I challenge you to survive that long without thinking of killing yourself at least once when you know it's all there is, that's all you've got, this big empty ship and 90 years of solitude and utter, mind-scrambling boredom. You'd be banging your head against walls all the time. So don't blame Jim for looking for a reason to live. I quite enjoyed this movie and I hope that the critics get a grip and get a life. This isn't a story about a stalker. If Jim is a stalker then Jack from the 'Titanic' is also a stalker, and so is Christian Grey (OK, that one is a bit of a weirdo), and so is Richard Gere's character in 'Pretty Woman'. Not every guy chasing after a chick is a pervert (or a chick chasing after a guy, just think of Scarlett O'Hara 'stalking' her dear Ashley). These are movies, meant for our enjoyment. Let's not get political about every freakin' story we see on the screen."
" Very much worth seeing.
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,8,"I am not particularly a fan of sci-fi movies, or of Jennfier Lawrence, but this film is GOOOOOOOOD!Usually when a film is hyped as much as Passengers the reality of watching it often disappoints.The cinematography and effects are good, but what made the film something special for me was the way the cast portrayed their characters in a subtly brilliant story.Nothing was overdone. The effects were appropriate for the action without overriding the core of the film.All of the actors were superb, and as I watched I was drawn into their lives, thoughts, and feelings. Perhaps being such a small cast helped then to gel together.And for the guys - take your partner to see this movie - you won't regret it."
" Watch and Judge , Don't rely on critics or other opinions
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,9,"I saw too much negative opinions and critics on the film , Maybe because it's compared to films like Gravity in visual effects .. or maybe to Interstellar in the plot and music ! I don't know , It's better you see the film without pressures or giving it high expectations or comparisons ... WATCH IT AS IT IS !! This isn't Gravity or Nolan's masterpiece Interstellar The film was very good , I really enjoyed it and didn't feel bored the whole movie and believe me "" If you saw the trailer and u thought it's spoiler , you're definitely mistaken "" .. The acting was good , The plot was quite unique . Visual effects were very good , Music was outstanding .. I see nothing wrong with the movie , There you'll find real adventure and romance although I'm not fond of romance movies :""DThis is a very amusing film I highly recommend for you"
" Truly great movie!
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,9,"I was very impressed with Passengers! Truly great sci-fi movie, that we haven't seen for a while. It has a great plot, great acting, stunning visual effects, fascinating production design and finally, music was really great too!How could this movie not be nominated for Oscars Best Picture and crap like Moonlight gets the one??? Pasangens is a great movie, don't miss it!"
" What a wonderful experience
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,10,"It is the surprise of 2016 for me! I heard so much bad reviews that I was skeptical before watching it. But thanks to my fiancé she forced me and it is a very good story, emotional, with perfect actors. Lawrence is so wonderful, Pratt very credible. What would I do if I was in this spaceship? It's a very good question. Rate: 10/10"
" Film is good and enjoyable but has some plot holes
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,6,"I really enjoyed this movie. The actors are beautiful and talented. The movie was enjoyable. But as a Sci-Fi movie, there are some disturbing plot holes that will leave you unsatisfied after watching this movie. If I consider this a romantic movie then I have to say, Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence both have done a great job. They looked good and acted well. Their chemistry was so good that it reminded me of Titanic.If I consider this movie as a Sci-Fi then it is really unsatisfying. Why the spaceship is so luxurious? I can allow a gym in a spaceship but a swimming pool? Come on!Why there are loads of normal looking foods in a spaceship? It would be realistic if they have to eat protein bars or something like that.The most disturbing part is planting a tree in the middle of the floor of the spaceship by making a hole in that floor. I mean come on, didn't you find any vase or urn or something like that?"
" They are wrong for judging this movie, incorrectly. It is a well thought out experience with great actors and visuals.
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,8,"Alright, this is a early morning review. Started watching Passengers around midnight with the thought that I will part watch it and go to sleep. I couldn't, got so hooked to the movie and the cinematic experience that it portrayed, so beautifully. It had a not so subtle moral lining to the entire script which read, ""You can't get so hung up on where you'd rather be, that you forget to make the most of where you are."". Evidently true, as it is the key to success and staying happy as most of our lives have events that are out of our control and all we need to do is accept and make the best of the present. Philosophical and difficult but a practice we should try and achieve to have a fulfilled life. I always thought why Jennifer Lawrence was getting so much shine from the world (as an actor) ? There are better counterparts. I apologize, as I am absolutely wrong with this quick judgement and change course to the idea that she is a true talent that world cinema has been gifted. Pardon me, for this. Will you? =)Chris Pratt has definitely done the part with ease with the sweet sensibility he puts into his role(s) without being too chivalrous. It is great as roles need such exhibition of character and frankly not many can pull it off, presently!Overall, I want to conclude with the fact that this movie got the nominations, which it did not win at the #Oscars2017 but never got nominated in the categories that it could have won. Very well made and definitely hats off coming from the man who directed the #ImitationGame. I salute you, #MortenTyldum.P.S. And #Moonlight won the best picture.. so did #LaLaLand sweep a great deal of them, #Academy - Thou is requested to see musicals with equality to other scripts and give an equal judgement. (Walt Disney! You must be happy wherever you are?)I think the downside was that more could be added in terms of the story and elements but even that doesn't do the trick since ""Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them"" had a lot if it and still didn't cut through the best picture category.Finally! Congrats on the two nominations for best score and best production design. I think it was really elaborate and well thought out. But, who made me the judge? ;)"
" An entertaining, wasted time
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,5,"The truth is that I expected worse, I thought it was going to be a bad movie and I only found a love movie with a great atmosphere. For the duration it has not become long. It is entertaining, although it does not count much at the beginning and does not advance but knows to entertain.The effects are beautifully done. It is logical. It is science fiction but just to set it. In fact, it's a love movie. The pity is that the moral part, have left abandoned and that is the worst thing that makes the film. I do not know how many people would have done what the protagonist does. The actor does what he does, how many would we do? I do not know, you can understand, but it gives a lot to think about, whether you can decide for others or not.The two actors are fine, yes, they have spark together. The waiter is great.A normal photograph that accompanies the story.An address that is not spectacular but at least knows how to take the film forward, but leave behind the most interesting part of the script.It is a movie that will stay there but will not go further."
" Queen takes Bishop
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,6,"This movie is one of the unusual movies we like to see. Few actors, even fewer setups and still and still it lasted almost two hours. The time Laurence Fishburne entered the scene I said to my self ""Finaly we will see some action"". Then ten minutes later I took it back.I could not decide if it was because of the script or because of his acting but Chris was simply not good enough for me. Movie started getting better the moment Jennifer entered.Even though it is not one of my favorites, it was the best SciFi I've seen the last couple of months."
" A good idea ruined by Hollywood-action-stereotypes
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,6,"In the last years most SF-movies just deal with dystopies, one darker than the other. If you grew up with Buck Rogers and Star Trek and like SF-worlds that offer an alternative way of living or at least some perspective, you will like this one - until it finally turns into crap. The plot is great, the acting is fine, there are a lot of good ideas in it, a lot of good visual effects (a swimming pool during a failure of artificial gravity...) and there is even an essential ethical issue in it - actually the moments when SF really unfolds its potential.But finally it turns into one of those completely implausible action flicks. SPOILERS: The idea that the two main characters (passengers!) are able to save the gigantic vessel is somehow far fetched in the first instance, but it could have been written in a way that would have made it plausible. If there would have been just some minor, little damage, some insignificant computer error the story would have been working. And it would have been more SF! It would have been a comment on the naiveté of men, to put their lives in the hand of machines. But, no, it has to be the impact of a meteorite! And an overload of the fusion reactor! Holes in the shell plates of the ship! And completely destroyed computer panels! And everything has to collapse right in the moment were they discover the damage! So they (a writer and a mechanic!) repair the computer within several minutes (!!!) And they know how to cool down the reactor (!!!) Find a little hatch on the outside of the gigantic ship within a few minutes and know how to open it (!!!) Then the guy is able to survive the blow-out of a fusion reactor, shielding himself with a small door (!!!) He is not even catapulted out into the vast empty space but is levitating just within reach around the ship with a cracked helmet (!!!) and she is able to get in to the space-suit so fast that she still can save him within time. Then they live happily ever after. In a paradise garden they planted on the spacecraft. With gigantic trees that had just 89 years to grow. And birds (wtf?!). Where does this bird in the last scene come from? Did it grew on a tree?Conclusion: A fine SF-movie in the first half ruined by stupid blockbuster standards in the second. What a waste of money and talent."
" That was a really bad and boring sci-fi experience
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,4,"When I first heard about this movie, over a year ago I was thrilled and really looking forward to it. I had it up with Rogue One and Arrival as must see movies for 2016. But when the trailer came out.I was not impressed and could already guess it not was as I thought. So I did not see it at the cinema but waited.It was also a real disappointment when I saw it. Bad story and really bad acting from both Jennifer and Chris. The effects are OK and look good. But the story and acting was not worth spending money for. The story was so predictable, so it soon became really boring watching."
" Way better than gravity
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,8,"This is an awesome film.i avoided it earlier but to tell the truth it is one of the better films I've seen in awhile.I've seen Jackie,Snowden,Collide and quite a few more and i like this one the best.First i like how after Jim preston is awake he leaves all as is.Even after even three of the passengers are together no one goes to awaken or disturb other people still hibernating. The guy Jim manages to look like a few employees in Provo utah which is neat i thought the same thing about Nicolas hoult in Collide but it was not local and centralized specifically.So where i'm at almost two hours into the movie the generator in the theatre went down. There are moments when Aurora Lane the character played by Jennifer lawrence resembles both joey laurent adams as well as Renee zellwegger.Her name is super because its also a name of a main street almost highway out in Seattle: aurora.So the ship is really kind of screwed up.Everyones life is at stake. The passengers have already had every access available to every part of the ship..there is a critical point of reference going on right now during the blackout...and its life or death. In the meantime a lot is going on with so few characters hence the Gravity reference..plus,well you know how George Clooney ended up.This seems to be almost like that except the two main characters Jim and aurora have already dated and been intimate unlike the professional business relationship Sandra Bullock had had in her film...well its back on hope you like it as much as i did But Don't Get Your Hopes Up."
" Get a life
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,7,"As a sharp and slick work of fantasy fiction this film entertained me. It reminded me of 2001, Silent Running, Mission To Mars and even The Shining, but with its own gravitational spin. It covered 90 years in less than 2 hours and successfully kept me from looking at the clock.One of the 5000 hibernating passengers (has suspended animation been put into cold storage?) on an interstellar starship is inadvertently woken up on the journey with 90 years left to go to arrival – if you couldn't re-hibernate what would you do? Would you calmly walk about a gargantuan ship populated with a handful of robots drinking and playing with your yo-yo for the rest of your life or try to get someone to talk to? Love the place you're in or Love the one you're with. With this moral dilemma eating his vitals Chris Pratt is suitably chiselled and wooden as usual, however Jennifer Lawrence steals the show with her intensely believable performance as usual. On believability - whether someone could survive being so close to a nuclear reactor as was Pratt, protected only by an oven door is a moot point and a bit of a comedy moment too, but I thought the well thought of Gravity was similarly daft and not so weighty as this either. For the bar room scenes with Arthur The Android a bit of Al Bowlly crooning in the echoey background wouldn't have been amiss, but thankfully science fiction films and mankind have gone far beyond Joan Baez warbling end credits even if the message is similar.Whether the film is guilty of Sexism or not it's certainly guilty of Corn, and nothing wrong with that at all. Excellent hokum, superb cgi cartoonery, and a central performance well worth watching."
" Not a giant blockbuster space opera
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,7,"I'm surprised how harsh the critics have been on this movie. I enjoyed the character development, story and chemistry between Pratt and Lawrence. Some good humor mixed in especially the scenes with Sheen. It is not a giant blockbuster space opera if that is what you are expecting. It exposes the fear and tough choices you might be faced with in a crisis and the human side of interstellar travel. It is very well shot and visual appealing, but if you want to wait it would be a good one to watch at home too. I look forward to more from this director (The Imitation Game) and writer (Prometheus)."
" Two hours of your life you will never get back.
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,1,"There are so many other films of this Genre that are SOOOOOO much better. Don't waste your time on this.the acting is OK, the story is .. meh.But somehow it isn't a cohesive story and just bored me quite frankly.So, watch Gravity or Aliens or 2001 or even Red Dwarf for better entertainment."
" Everything Just Too Convenient In This Soulless Effort
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,2,"As soon as I saw the promotional material for ""Passengers"", I was concerned. It looked for all the world like the stereotypical, glossy flick that uses slick special effects to cover up for the fact that it is hollow both in terms of plot and character. On the other hand, this is the exact genre of film that I love, and Jennifer Lawrence's presence will never dissuade me from a film. As it turned out, I was indeed the sucker for seeing this film, which personifies the concept of ""Hollywood slick"".For a basic plot summary, ""Passengers"" is the story of the spacecraft Avalon, which is transporting a crew of 5,000 to a new planet that will be colonized much like Earth. A malfunction occurs, and Jim (Chris Pratt) wakes up too early...about 90 years too early, to be exact. After some time of crippling loneliness, he makes the momentous decision to wake up fellow passenger Aurora (Lawrence). The duo quickly discover the reason behind the malfunctions and must work together to get the journey back on track.""Passengers"" is a film completely devoid of any interesting plot devices or character development. The whole thing is just too ""convenient"". All the main beats can be predicted a mile away, there is no chemistry between Pratt & Lawrence, and what passes for ""character development"" in the movie is laughable. A high school film student could have created more interesting, in-depth characters.As such, ""Passengers"" is clearly a paint-by-numbers, ""vehicle"" film in which everyone involved knew it would make X amount of dollars of profit. In that sense, it hits all the right beats: set in space, slick visuals, Pratt for the ladies, Lawrence for the gentleman, yadda yadda yadda. Creatively, however, those elements add up to absolutely nothing.Perhaps I'm being a bit too harsh in giving ""Passengers"" the rock-bottom 1-star treatment (taken strictly as a film it is maybe 2-stars at best), but partially I'm just angry that Hollywood can continue to put out such lackluster efforts. This is especially true when they tantalize me with some of my ""favorite cinema things"" (sci-fi, Lawrence, etc.) and then produce such a soulless flop. I'm not completely anti-Hollywood or anything like that, but it still galls me that ""Passengers"" can: 1. Even be made; and 2. Be made so poorly with all the money behind it.Simply put: ""Passengers"" was one of the most boring, predictable, asinine movies I've seen in quite some time. I can see children liking it (for the visuals and extremely simple plot), date couples flocking to it (for the mass appeal of Pratt & Lawrence), but that is about it. Creatively, the tank gauge rests fully on ""Empty""."
" It's fine, Enjoyable even.
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,6,"I'm just now seeing it. I didn't bother because the critics called it a big miss. I disagree. It's was very entertaining. I like that the twist happened fairly early on and the characters mostly experienced it realistically. The big splashy scifi scenes are all great and the aesthetics are pretty to look at. Why am I not giving it I higher score?I really didn't care for Jennifer Lawrence character. She acted well with what she had but I don't like the character. She literally was an empty shell. She was so supposed to be a writer, but had never written anything and didn't know what she wanted top write. She really had no personality and was this kind of bland foil that of course would just into the dashing protagonists arms. Try to imagine nicole kidman or sigourney weaver playing this character. I think they'd laugh at the offer. Basically there's no tit a tat or clash between the characters until the twist which kind of resolves itself within a span of minutes on film. This movie I think would have done far better critically if JL has been given a stronger character to work with. I have the sense that some draft of the exists, but for the sake of run time or laziness the writers just made her essentially ""a dumb blonde"". I hate that term, I really doe and it irritates me that it's what I feel like they went for. The movie is enjoyable. Just disappointing in that regard."
" Very enjoyable Sci-fi
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,6,"Watch any trailer and you normally get the main points of a movie. Not this one, It caught me of guard, in a good way. Chris Pratt as the lead actor impressed me, his acting was far better than I've seen before, and points to a promising future. Jennifer Lawrence was good, but nothing special, though her part didn't require it!. The only other two actors were Michael Sheen, who played an android and Lawrence Fishburne, who in my mind was a nod to 'Event Horizon'. The Cinematography was excellent, and the direction was OK. It is hard to describe the movie without giving away the plot, but suffice to say I had a surprisingly good 2 hours in the Cinema. Good movie to watch, but not groundbreaking!"
" Simple Love Story Which is Larger than the Sum of its Parts
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,8,"In the end you would end up thinking this was a movie with simple story, but all the elements of storytelling come together so brilliantly in this movie that it leaves you spellbound. I read some reviews wherein folks are bashing this movie for being a pseudo sci-fi movie, and I agree it is not that at all except that it takes place on a space ship. But its a love story at its core. If you want to watch a good romantic flick, go for it.The beginning is a tad bit slow, but then it picks up pace and takes the audience on a journey which is dreamy yet real. Chris Pratt is stranded on a spaceship which is scheduled to land on a new world in 90 years, but he is somehow woken up due to some malfunction and faces a reality of dying before reaching the destination planet.In his despair he decides to wake up Jenifer Lawrence, who is lovable as always, and the chemistry between the two of them is simply brilliant from the time these two meet. You see these two fall in love like in a fairytale but then there is the secret of Chris waking up Lawrence which threatens to break the bond these two have formed living alone on the spaceship.In the end this movie leaves you with a message that You can't get so hung up on where you'd rather be, that you forget to make the most of where you are.The soundtrack by Thomas Newman is dreamy, with some bits reminding you of Interstellar. The chemistry between Chris Pratt and Jenifer Lawrence is effortlessly natural. The screenplay does justice to the story nicely.Jenifer Lawrence moves between all emotions with equal panache and Chris Pratt delivers in this romantic drama as well as he did in GotG.Definitely an 8/10 for me."
" Very good...
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,8,"I watched the movie at home and I must admit I enjoyed it. Actors are very good, plot is very interesting and it's ending is very nice. There are only few actors in whole movie and that's what makes it different and interesting. The star-ship configuration is also very nice, as well as space frontiers. I can't find anything wrong, but feel that something's missing to make the movie really great. I don't know what, but it's probably the ˝Homestead 2˝. We should have seen it, at least a bit of it. But, the story could bee continued on Homestead 2 in next movie, that would be interesting."
" Quite good and original, a pleasant surprise.
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,7,"I was pleasantly surprised at how good ""Passengers"" was, its not great, but its way better than people make it up to be, its quite suspenseful and intense, but also quite fun and enjoyable, it has a very strange premise but it executes it very well, its really well directed by Morten Tyldum, who most people know for ""The Imitation Game"", another really good film.""Passengers"" may feel predictable at points, but most aspects of the film are quite original and riveting, it makes the audience feel a plethora of emotions, it has some pretty inventive scenes in it.I would recommend the film to those who are looking for something different, this is quite a good film, a bit weak at points but its mostly really good."
" Fantastic graphics (yes, really, I was impressed even though it is 2017)
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,9,"On a 120 yr trip to another planet from earth, an accident abroad the ship causes one of the passengers to wake up after just 30 yrs. He lives for an year alone, gets crazy and wakes up a girl, and the story goes...The graphics here is easily better than movies like Gravity and I never thought that I would be impressed by graphics or sci-fi sets ever again after having watched all the sci-fi movies with rating 7.5 and higher, yet this movie takes it to a higher level. It does not use graphics for the sake of graphics, its so original and part of the setting that it truly takes you in. The level of detail inside the space ship surprised me again and again.The primary objective of this movie is a love story, something simple, and I think its simple cheezy people like me who will like it. So see this movie if you have simple tastes (I truly enjoyed it and felt that its worth far greater than the 7.0 rating that it currently has)."
" It is a joke that anyone can review this positively, who is over 14 yrs old
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,2,"Someone even called it realistic. It isn't, in any way whatsoever, realistic. It starts off like a half-baked Black Mirror idea, played by two non-charismatic, self-conscious and wooden actors, complete with lines like ""that can't be good"", ""not good"", ""you've gotta be kidding me"". Then the plot turns, and it becomes a rushed, silly Saturday morning cartoon. The final scene is so pithy, trite and forced, and does no justice to the story that you've just wasted two hours on. Along the way you'll see huge imitations of Alien (petal like hibernation capsules), Prometheus (medic pod), Avatar (capsule shots of Chris Pratt that are composed, shot and colour-tinted exactly like those Worthington), Gravity (untethered in space, rescued by loose cord grabbing), Sunshine (plants on a ship, watching the sun from a viewing room), The Island (a strained relationship in a sci-fi environment that gives way to stupid action), Moon (AIs that respond with smiley faces, overall environment designs, food vending machines), The Shining (the look of the bartender, the pattern on some walls matching the carpet of the Overlook Hotel). Its SO derivative, and not just because its a spaceship movie - there are direct copies and I have no idea why. A real shame of the film also is that a few very short scenes were needlessly injected purely to make the trailers look like it was some wildly inventive action film. I'm talking about the brief anti- gravity shots, particularly the swimming pool one. They're completely unnecessary in the film, last mere seconds, yet were milked like crazy in the trailer as if the last act of the film was this wild anti-gravity action thing. Its just a very, very lame film."
" Its really good time movie really fun time watching but its not the same as gravity or interstellar or even the martian
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,7,"I know im very very late at reviewing this movie but it wasn't at my counts but i found thats the only thing i didn't see now when i saw the trailer the ratings it got it didn't enter my mind i wanted to know what was the problem and when i saw with my eyes its problems wasn't good at all the negatives is Jennifer Lawrence's Acting was not as good as her other films she was exaggerating in her acting in a bad way and the screenplay wasn't stable i felt that who wrote the screenplay was confused in writing some scenes thats why it didn't have stable thing i felt it was like drama,romantic,comedy,sci-fi and when the ship was spinning and they where still standing as they are,the positives the romance between them was very good and chris pratt finally acted in a new way like in the beginning he was so persuasive in hos acting who saw the movie will understand what i mean and the ending was good it was full suspense but i enjoyed it more than silence from the end keda i will offend silence when i review it in the end i enjoyed passengers and entertained me my rating is 7.5/10"
" Stupid and bore
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,1,"The whole concept of the movie is flawed. It suggests that they are travelling to a colony and it will take them 120 years to reach their destinations and 19 years to send an email. So if it takes them 120 years, how did they build the colony? Unless it took them thousands of years to build it, with is not logical in many ways. After all, it was a waste of time. I love science fiction, but not stupidity. I don't understand the high ratings"
" Passengers (2016)
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,6,"Two of Hollywood's current top stars finally come together in this sci-fi adventure from Morten Tyldum. Its not a name that rolls right off the tongue or is too familiar but I have seen his previous effort, The Imitation Game. While it was a technically well made biopic about an important man, it wasn't all that interesting. I wasn't too impressed with the trailers for Passengers as it looked like a cookie cutter sci-fi film coming in a time where these types of films are really popular.The film is basically what I had feared that it would be. First, let me talk about the positives. I had no problems with the effects in the film. I thought the space scenes looked good and the set and production design was excellent. The spaceship looked sleek, modern, and alluring. The score was also nice. Both Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence work well together and put in good performances. I think Lawrence overacts in the really emotional moments but its fine because she's good elsewhere here.The film suffers from pauses and lagging for the first hour or so. Its repetitive at times ad just seems really inconsequential. Nothing goes on for a majority of the film and it drags a slight bit. I did not feel like the film really explored amazingly new ground. Films like Interstellar and Moon covered similar concepts and in a much better way. Its easy to question and scratch your head at some of the motivations of the characters (and androids). About an hour in I was really struggling to continue with the film but soldiered through.If you are a fan of Pratt or J-Law you may want to check this out. If you are like me and an avid sci-fi/space film fan you may be sorely disappointed by the generic and familiar nature of a film that should have really dazzled with the stakes that the film seemed to offer. Still, I guess you could find some enjoyment out of this film despite it being pretty flawed. Not every film is going to be a masterpiece, I just expected this film to offer something better and more engaging.6/10"
" neither a sci-fi nor a love story
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,5,"so we are suppose to watch a SF movie ,SF are meant to be complex , complex problem arising which even real science cant defy , it did had success in that part but then the solution it present is absolute non sense and doesn't sync with other things .how can u have 100% surety of a ship not sinking we learned that in 1924 when titanic sink-ed on earth and here we have a totally uncontrolled spaceship.. and then we have a mechanic .. not too educated just that co-fee guy 'fixing ' a nuclear reactor of a space ship without no prior knowledge while the crew wake to discover it is his last few days .the question goes why someone as foolish as a mechanic Wu be lucky to repair a spaceship while the authorized person is stupid just cox his name? bullshit story they sued have watched inters-teller before creating such illogical mess while Chris Patti look good for a mechanic .. Jlaw didn't fit in the roll ..a writer diving in space after being hit by me tel in controlling nuclear reactor .. .my take if you cant balance sci-fi and romance..take few more actors like Anna Ferris and make it a full blown black comedy"
" A well made sci-fi despite weak script
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,8,"Sure the script hasn't got the best substance, but the execution is near perfect from the perspective of a science fiction enthusiast. The writer took a page out of a space lover's dreams catalog and carved out a pretty simple love story. Scientific inaccuracies can be easily ignored thanks to its breathtaking visuals, for which the movie rightly finds an academy award nomination and quite a few wins in production/set design. Both the key protagonists did a fine job portraying various emotions. In short, a pretty decent one-time watch!"
" Amazing movie, wrong director
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,7,"This movie is absolutely breath taking as far as the spaceship design is concerned. I mean, how on earth do they manage to create such environment? It is magical! The acting is great. It is never a bad thing to have Fishburne in a movie anyway. The story is in itself very interesting but the way it is treated is a turn down. The action scenes are summarized and you don't get the tension, the suspense of it. It goes from one scene in total danger to another scene where everything is fine again in one second. This movie would have been much better with another director. This director is clearly out after fame, trying to make something commercial/international to prove that his country (Norway) can have a great director. Well, nice try but one advice, be yourself! Seek art, not fame! But anyway, in spite of this, the movie is one more time breath taking visually. Till the end when a super cheesy and really horrible credit music makes a big anti-climax and takes away all the atmosphere and the experience of the movie. Another attempt to seek commercialism."
" What a fantastic idea combining sci-fi space survival thriller with rom-com
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,4,"Yep, Passengers is like 2 completely different films carelessly stitched together. It not only failed to add comedy to a serious space sci-fi survival premise, but also failed to even be a half-decent sci- fi movie, which is what it's supposed to be in the first place.The space sci-fi portion is so formulaic that anyone who has watched a few movies or played a few video games of the genre can predict the entire plot at the very beginning without much effort, because Passengers utilized every single trope the writers could think of, from space mental illness to a few people fixing a vast spaceship to venting the reactor.Moreover, Passengers blatantly copied very specific stylistic elements of movies/games of the genre. The opening is almost identical to Pandorum, the spaceship is the same as WALL-E's Axiom, the survival element is very similar to Alien and Dead Space minus the monsters, the infirmary med-pod is lifted directly from Prometheus, the sun slingshot scene reminds me of Sunshine, not to mention the bar from the Shinning. In addition, Laurence Fishburne may just be reference to Event Horizon. These were completely beyond ""paying homage"" as they are central to the movie's story, rather than a passing cameo or an innocuous Easter Egg hidden in the background.All in all, Passengers packaged banal and trite spaceship sci-fi clichés with a romantic comedy and tried to pass it off as something fresh. Instead, they could have tried to bring some life into the trapped on a spaceship premise through a compelling story."
" Good acting and special effects but lacks in story
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,5,"The story is the main problem with this movie; the acting and effects are pretty good. Some points I'm bringing up (and are brought up by other reviews) consist of the realistic common-sense thinking when going on a 120-year hibernated space flight to another planet. It makes sense that there would be a rotating crew to be there when something unexpected occurs instead of relying solely on technology. There would also be a way to go back into hibernation hence the rotating crew system. Even if you assume there was none of those above, there should be more than one ""auto doc"" pod to service health emergencies for 5000+ passengers and crew members. So there should've been a way for Jim and Aurora to both go back to hibernation.The story also feels like a story within a story. First, there's story of the ship malfunctioning and needing to be repaired and secondly, the Jim and Aurora relationship. It puts the ship repair story on pause early on in the movie after Jim gives up trying to fix his hibernation issue. Then, it goes to the Jim and Aurora story all the way until the crew member wakes up and finally the ship repair story starts up again. Once this happens, it does a good job interweaving both stories together.The ending could've been a lot better. I felt like it was rushed. Ignoring the common sense thinking above, there could've been more time spent showing what Jim and Aurora left behind. Also, since there was one auto doc pod, they could have had a child and let him/her grow up a bit then go into the pod to pass on Jim and Aurora's legacy.Overall, I think it was a little better than what critics made it out to be but there are definite problems with the movie. Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt did the best they could given the script. The special effects were done very well. I was most disappointed in the ending as I felt it was rushed and things could have been done differently to give a more satisfying ending."
" Surprisingly beautiful & not what I expected.
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,8,"I went into this expecting a schmaltzy, fluffy Titanic in space. I'm not the biggest fan of Pratt, but I actually shed a tear when he was floating in space, looking out on the firmament and weeping. His loneliness was palpable, and the relationship between Pratt & Lawrence is believable. Don't see this if you're expecting groundbreaking sci-fi. It's exquisitely filmed, beautifully set, and believably acted though it is, at its heart, a love story. See it for the visual beauty that it is and enjoy."
" Titanic for imbeciles
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,3,"I'm sorry for being so blunt in my summary, but those that defends the science in this movie, calling it realistic, have absolutely no idea what so ever what they are talking about.The makers of this film have the balls to ""keep it real"" by only traveling at half the speed of light, yet have a human survive a nuclear fusion blast which is at a minimum of thousands of degrees Celsius. I could probably list hundreds more of these examples, my point is, this movie is hypocritical.If the argument was: But this is sci-fi, anything can happen.Well in this case using a rotating space craft for gravity and flying at ""only"" half the speed of light, makes absolutely no sense. Why use real science and at the same time break all the rules? I do know the answer of course. It gives them the chance to show off some fancy CGI, which is exactly what they did. To bad the CGI in this film was mediocre at best, and even if it had been award winning material, the rest of the film falls flat, making it a shipwreck in space.There is a saying in the movie business: A director is never better than his last film.This is going to be rough on Morten Tyldum for sure. I loved his Norwegian film ""hodejegerne/headhunters"" and his next film ""The imitation game"". Both are good movies and the world opened up to Tyldum. I saw interviews of him, i read about him, and he has several times stated he wants to tell good stories, he is not going to let himself sell out for the big studios just to make blockbusters.Well, he did....This movie has nothing going for it, it is a boring, slow paced, stupid, bad acted, overpriced, silly meaningless film which seem to have focused on making 12 year old girls sappy instead of actually create a film that can appeal to everyone, and not treat the older audience with a brain like morons.Titanic is a opposite to this, James Cameron might have just had a basic love story at it's core, but it is his attention to details, building of characters, revolutionary vision in effects and so on that makes Titanic a movie that stands out and appeals to all ages, and he does not use cheap tricks just to show off.And this acting. 30 million dollars worth. You got to be kidding me.Jennifer is payed 20 million + 30% of the profits. Chris is payed 10 million.And this is the performances they deliver? Holy lord almighty, Hollywood is going down the drain. These actors have given so many memorable performances before, maybe not Oscar worthy, but still, pretty good performances. And when they get this amount of money, they seem to not care, it's like they don't believe in the film.Which is where i'm back at. I did hear about the troubles behind the scenes, Tyldum and Pratt had a lot of problems with each other on the set. And the movie suffers from things like this.I have to blame Tyldum for taking this job, he broke his promise and made a bad film. The story and scriptwriters are also to blame. I can't really blame the producers, they are suppose to make money, and they did, so good job to them. I payed to see the film as well, after reading almost only negative reviews in the press, so i guess i kinda knew what i was getting into, i just feel like warning others.Well anyways, not much of a movie review I'm afraid, more like a movie bashing for it's obvious flaws.3/10 - Bad"
" Argh.
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,1,"Just terrible, cheap, cliché melodrama disguised in eye-pleasing sci- fi fetishism, with nice effects and sexy actors. The worst movie I have watched since long time. I wasn't really expecting a great piece of art, but such a vast consumer cheapness really shocked me. I like the color blue which prevails in the movie, thanks, that was great."
" A good movie but...
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,6,"Once the basic premise of the movie became obvious, not long in to the movie, then it ruined the whole thing for me.So you are alone on a space shift, doomed to live out your life in solitary, surrounded by thousands of other passengers in deep hibernation. The honourable thing to do would be to make the best it, not let yourself go to pieces then wake up a random female you like the look of. Obviously at that point you knew they would fall in love and live happy ever after. But seriously, you have just destroyed someones future hopes and dreams of a new beginning on a new world, and they fall in love with you after a brief spell of being a little upset at being woken up?I know you have to suspend belief to a degree at the movies, but the plot is so implausible the movie makers must think us all idiots.I'm still giving it a 6 for other aspects of the film, and it is worth a watch, just leave your brain at home."
" Uninteresting
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,4,"I found myself dozing after about 15 min and wanting to leave the theater-reminder next time sit close to entrance.Other than that, the story between the two protagonists is full of clichés. The mechanic is typical mechanic and typically experiencing Robinson Crusoe despair. For some reason he finds ""perfect"" match with a writer, which in turn, for some reason falls for him. There is no dislike between them whatsoever. The dialogue is bland; I don't see what's special about her writing, any teen can write like that. Everything in the movie is typical and anyone can write such a script. Hey, guys did you hear about someone called Cpt Picard, who had his own quirks and imperfections? SF evolved. But, probably the creators of the movie were interested in something as average and bland as possible. The heroes are two eye-candy white actors (though as not to be totally politically incorrect they have a black captain). Also the selfishness act of the protagonist is not so original, the idea can be found in Interstellar.The only good thing here are visual effects, the things that happen in the spaceship, the images of the outer space are beautiful. And the spaceship looks cool. The part after she wakes up is slightly more interesting. As they start to talk, occasionally they talk about more important information. For example her mentioning how the company profits from travellers."
" Great Sci-Fi story.
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,7,"So if I was suddenly awoken from hyper sleep 90 years before my journey was complete and had no way to get back to sleep and I was stuck on the ship alone with Jenifer Lawrence to keep me company, that would not be the worse case scenario.Chris Pratt definitely agrees as he plays Jim who was put in that situation as a bit of a nod to the film Silent Running, as he wakes up all alone and attempts to get back into hyper sleep with all his failures leading to depression, until a bar tender gives him the advice of taking advantage of his situation on the ultimate star ship cruse liner by tempering with some functions to upgrade his room stay and some other perks, which I think loosened him up a bit to make a decision most lonely men in his situation would most likely do.It is a very inactive Sci-Fi film that actually test the charm of Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence as with the exception of a few scenes from Micheal Shannon as a robot bartender and Lawrence Fishbure as a crew member awoken on a glitch, it's pretty much those two for almost Two hours. Though I think I preferred watching Matt Damon for that length of time stranded on Mars, Chris Pratt is very likable, and I have to be honest J-Law is very cute. I could not even tell you if I liked her character or not all I could tell you is that there were moments when she looked crazy hot and in those moments it enhanced my like of Chris Pratt's character whose lucky enough to be stranded with her.It was a beautifully made Sci-Fi film with the visual effects creating an amazing ship.While the film does explore some interesting ideas in Sci-Fi it's mostly done with talk, which is ironic as the movie looks like it cost a lot and there is far too much talk for it to cost that much dough.Had great potential to be a great Sci-Fi film (and get people kissing it's booty like they are Arrival) but your love of the movie does fully count on how much you like Pratt and Lawrence http://cinemagardens.com"
" Potentially enjoyable, yet full of poor story decisions.
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,5,"Passengers is by no means a bad movie, it is competent both in direction and acting. It does, however, suffer in the storytelling area. You see, passengers seems to be afraid of straying from almost every negative storytelling trope imaginable, with both the main characters making questionable decisions repeatedly, as well as certain story elements being far too convenient and seemingly poorly thought out.I would recommend this movie as one to watch with our significant other or in a setting in which you don't want to pay too much attention to a movie but I wouldn't expect you to desire re-watching it any time soon.Spoiler review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEDyyjXggsU"
" Best science fiction movie
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,8,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie more than most of the ""critically acclaimed"" films I've watched this year. The movie is worth your time. Firstly, 10/10 for realism. I would absolutely have done all those things if I were in their shoes. The movie is cherished and loved. The movie is so great.The starship Avalon is transporting over 5,000 colonists to the planet Homestead II, a journey that takes 120 years. The colonists and the entire crew are in hibernation pods, but as the ship passes through a large asteroid field, the ship's shield is heavily strained causing a malfunction that awakens one passenger, mechanical engineer Jim Preston, 90 years early.After a year of isolation, with no company except Arthur, an android bartender, Jim contemplates suicide. One day he notices beautiful Aurora Lane in her pod. He read about her profile who was a writer with a humorous personality. After so much about struggle within inside, he awakens her, claiming her pod malfunctioned like his. Aurora, devastated she may grow old and die before the ship reaches Homestead II, attempts a fruitless effort at re-entering hibernation, just as Jim had tried. Eventually, she accepts her situation and begins writing a book about her experiences. Jim and Aurora grow closer, becoming lovers.A year later, Jim inadvertently allows Arthur to reveal the truth to Aurora. After Aurora knew about the truth which Jim awakens her, she mad at Jim and beat him, leave him, do not want to see him again. Soon after, however, another pod failure awakens Gus, a Chief Deck Officer. The three discover multiple failures in the ship's systems. Gus attempts repairs with Jim and Aurora's help, while Aurora still blames Jim for stealing her life. Gus' body begins failing; medical tests in the Autodoc, an automated medical diagnostics and treatment pod, show that his hibernation pod's malfunction has physically damaged his body, and he has hours left to live. Before dying, Gus gives Jim and Aurora his ID badge to access crew areas and repair the ship.The two find and trace a colliding asteroid's path through the ship's hull from two years earlier that damaged the computer administering the reactor. Attempts to repair the computer lead to further reactor damage. Jim realizes a fusion reactor must be vented by opening an outer vent hatch. Aurora assists while admitting she is terrified of losing Jim and living on the ship alone. Aurora, from inside the ship, and Jim, outside, successfully vent the reactor. However, Jim's tether snaps and his damaged spacesuit is losing oxygen. Aurora retrieves and resuscitates Jim in the Autodoc, relieved that he is alive and seemingly forgiving him for his decision; the two share a moment of embrace. Jim later learns that the Autodoc can act as a makeshift hibernation pod for Aurora. However, she realizes this would mean never seeing Jim again. After 88 years, the ship's passengers and crew awaken shortly before arrival on Homestead II. They discover a small house amid lush vegetation on the ship's concourse area. Aurora's book reveals that she chose to stay awake with Jim and finish writing her story."
" Needed a Better Storyline
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,5,"Good CGI.However, the writing was definitely male-oriented. What are the chances that Aurora didn't become pregnant? No mention in the film that birth control was taken care of. So I was thinking it was going to turn into an ""Adam and Eve"" story line, but no--they lived, they died, they turned the ship into a biosphere of plants and animals. Ho, hum, snore . . ."
" great

" Could be worse...
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,5,"One of those movies you watch on an aeroplane to kill some time and think, ""Meh, could be worse...""If you have to pay for it though, you could be excused for looking for a refund. Nice swimsuit though. And to those who think this is full of suspense, you *really* need to get out more ;)"
" Not really scifi - more a love story in a scifi setting
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,6,"My title sums it up nicely.If you are expecting a science fiction film you are in for a disappointment. There's a spaceship setting with plenty of decent effects but the story is all about a relationship between two people alone on a ship of thousands of people who are in suspended animation. Any scifi going on is utterly accidental and of no importance to the story.The love story is the standard one. Boy gets girl, boy looses girl and finally boy gets girl back. It's been done a million times. It's been done well here though if you are hoping for originality you ought to look elsewhere. If you were hoping for a good scifi film, forget it. If you want a love story it's worth a watch. I've given it a 6 as a love story. If I were to score it purely as a scifi film it'd be lower."
" i can't be a passenger
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,10,A good mixture of technology with love. technology is really great they are in a space ship which is very big and so comfortable with luxury things and carrying 5000 passengers gods know where . but there were a accident one of them a man got out from hibernation and he was alone in whole ship and there is 100 years ahead him to reach his destination he will surely dead but he break another girls hibernation just to get someone's company i don't think he did wrong cause just look at his life you will dead in some years and you don't have any human around you how you will gonna feel man i just can't imagine maybe feeling like The Martian or something now he got company of girl they are good until girl knew he break her hibernation. there was big big attack in ship but ship is still stand that's really very weird just whole ship is nearly burnt out but they got escaped overall a good one the love between them is good and technology was awesome. IMDb 7.0
" Flawed beyond repair
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,6,"Simply put, Morten Tyldum's Passengers is flawed beyond repair. Featuring two of Hollywood's most beloved stars and an interesting sci-fi concept and setting, the hopes for an entertaining and thought-provoking experience were relatively high. Sadly, when Passengers attempted to be any more than a disposable sci-fi romance flick, it became startlingly clear that the overall messages are not only morally askew, but downright disturbing. Political and philosophical themes of morality are explored throughout the generally linear story, and while the principles surrounding the overall situation can be fun to discuss afterwards, it seems the film didn't know what to do with it's moral dilemmas as they come up in the narrative. The overall themes and messages that the film portrays are quite disturbing. Moments of sadistically disregarding human life are brushed aside to make way for lovey-dovey scenes of Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence. It's not the overall wrong message that this film portrays that I find sloppy, but the way that the film stumbles over itself attempting to display it's philosophies. Despite this rather glaring issue, there is some enjoyment to be found here. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence do share some interesting chemistry and, while they weren't given much to work with emotionally, each of their performances generated some character. And while the aspects of romance were, quite literally, forced, the interactions and tension between Pratt's and Lawrence's characters were easily the most enjoyable parts of the film. Its not until the film's action and thrill sequences where the lack of substance is most noticeable. These scenes lack any essence of a punch and the laughably poor dramatic acting from Pratt only helps accentuate the goofiness of the situation. The special effects are decent and the set design is luscious and clean, but none of these qualities help to repair the overall empty feel of the throwaway story or the equally awful ending.To be fair, Passengers is harmless. It's dumb throwaway entertainment that I could find some enjoyment in. There are some interesting uses of special effects and some fun interactions between the film's leads, but when Passengers makes attempts at a philosophical and morality-questioning experience, it only comes off as amateurish. I'm not quite sure what the intentions of Passengers' messages were, but it was painfully obvious when the film was banking on the star-power of Pratt and Lawrence to excuse it's own bumbling narrative."
" Fresh Sci-Fi
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,8,"Amazing. One of the freshest sci-fi movies to have been released in quite a while. I'm a big fan of such movies so I go regardless of critics' opinions, but this one just takes the cake.No overcrowded scenes. Two simple, well portrayed characters, sharing time in a wonderful setting. The android bartender does a great job as well. Kudos to the writer and director as well. The writer also wrote Dr. Strange and Prometheus, so he just one up-ed his work here. The soundtrack is brilliant. Chilling and soothing at all the right moments.I highly recommend it to all age groups, whether you're into sci-fi or not. It's both exciting and frightening to think that all of this will be reality pretty soon.Two thumbs up!"
" good movie with one flaw
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,8,"I love that movie, however there is one very odd part in the story - how that you wake up after 30 years of sleep and you're shaved clean - even dead peoples hairs are still growing. The people lie in their sleeping tubes without being connected to any infusion systems. Very unlikely!I could imaging that one day humans could build large spaceships which could reach some not to distant stars - but sleeping in a whatever device for such time is out of reach."
" What I thought of the film
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,9,"Film was literally amazing, if you were to ask me to rate this film I would give it a ten on ten, hence why I rated the film 9/10.I didn't even wee during the film as I liked the film a little too much. One part of the film I especially liked was the credits they were great ,I would even watch them again. one thing I would improve about this film would be I would show the audience (you) what really happens to those dead corpses at the end."
" A film that could be better taken advantage of, but is only a medium-science film and totally forgettable.
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,4,"Passengers have a premise that has had my interest, but never had a Hype for the film, even the cast having 2 actors who are loved by many people, who is Jennifer Lawrence '' the Hollywood sweetheart '' and Chris Pratt who Also falling in the graces of many people, Jennifer Lawrence did good performances and won even an Oscar, but I think she's falling for each movie, last year she did not even deserve to be nominated for the movie Joy, and this year in Passengers she's just fine , Chris Pratt the same thing, the chemistry of both are medium, and the direction of Morten Tyldum is medium also, he loses control of the movie in many moments, but the technical quality of Passengers is undeniable, very beautiful special effects, and The soundtrack is very beautiful, the script is problematic, plus the film has a very tense scene, which has until trailer, the difference obviously is that it is complete here, Passengers sins in many ways, and it is just another movie forgettable. Note 4.7"
" I simply loved it!!!
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,10,"I saw the trailer of this film when I went to the theaters to watch Rogue One. At that time it seemed interesting, but not that much. I watched it today and I simply loved this film. It really got my attention and made me curious about the end since the beginning. It is a good suspense with a pinch of romance. It's been such a long time that I hadn't seen a film like this. Brilliant!"
" Forget the paid off critics. This movie is outstanding. In fact, I hope there's a sequel.
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,9,"I don't know what the critics are on about, I loved this movie.I didn't give it the last star only because I felt the last scene should have been 2 or 3 minutes longer with a few more views of the crew experiencing the 'aftermath'. There were a few instances where the science fiction didn't match up with real science but that's nothing new in the movies and I can overlook that artistic license. The biggest scene that sticks out most in my head as being off is the sealed compartment with the hull breach. In reality, the immeasurable vastness of space, entirely a vacuum, would suck a human out of a pinhole....A stream of liquid emerging out the other side. Any movie that shows people holding on to something and being lifted while they fight the force of the whole universe with their mere grip is pure fiction. The air would also vent instantly.OK, that science bit aside, I loved it. I thought it was a great plot, the visuals are amazing, the cast is outstanding and it's just a great movie overall. I just don't see why it was judged so harshly. I would definitely like to see a sequel that picks up initially about 55years from arriving where we see how they've lived and the lead up to a decision to have children or not. Her book narrating the history of their new lives like the decision to turn the promenade deck into a farm and 'outdoor space'. Perhaps so the couple's near century of unintended living, breathing and eating didn't deplete the ship's resources for the 5000 others or perhaps issues arise from the children not being registered passengers with bracelet ID's. Fast forward to the Awakening of the crew who discover what has happened, see the results of Jim's and Aurora's entire lives worth of living and surprisingly meet their two children, now in perhaps their 40's and 50's themselves. The adult children pick up the narration from there and describe not only the continued story of their parents triumphs, trials and eventual passing but most importantly, how history repeated itself when the children, longing for mates and love beyond a sibling bond awoke other passengers resulting in two separate yet complete family units on board! Perhaps at war, with a Cane and Able tribal vibe, or perhaps just living in peace anxiously awaiting the awakening to finally speak to the others... and tell all. Or alternately, they only have one child named Gus who is found in the Auto-doc and recalls their stories culminating in their last act.... placing they're now 20 something child in the improvised pod to spare him the loneliness they themselves are intimately familiar with. The possibilities are endless."
" Am I the only one who noticed...
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,9,"((spoilers)) ...That if Jim hadn't woken Aurora up, they'd all be dead? As improbable as the whole final sequence is, as it's written, fixing the reactor was a two-person job. One to pull the lever and one to hold the door open. If Jim hadn't woken Aurora up and somehow managed to figure out the problem on his own, taken a spacewalk to open the door, and then planned to come back in to pull the lever, it wouldn't have worked and all 5200+ people would have died. Bummer. So while critics are panning the movie as stalker-y, maybe it written so as to portray fate? A big clue in this regard is when Aurora sees the midwife in her pod and can tell by looking at her that they'd be friends. ""You can tell just by her face?"" Jim asks her (paraphrase), and she says yes, and the relief on Jim's face tells the audience that he's NOT some crazy stalker, but had a normal human intuition.Apparently subtlety and common storytelling techniques are too abstract for internet movie critics these days."
" Not suitable for anyone who knows sci-fi
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,2,"""A spacecraft traveling to a distant colony planet and transporting thousands of people has a malfunction in its sleep chambers. As a result, two passengers are awakened 90 years early.""The whole premise of this movie is just an excuse to create romance settings with ""the only two persons alive"" trope. In short, this is a romance movie comparable to chaos flicks. One thing to remember here is the general IMDb advice ""the movie is probably watchable if it is over 5.0, unless it is romance."" In this case, 7.0 was not enough.Since the only thing in this movie is the romance, let's talk about it. Short thoughts here:-It sucks.Longer thoughts here:Jennifer Lawrence can't act. She is herself once again. --- I wonder is Lawrence understands how forced she sounds whenever she yells and cries. --- Her performance in the movie ""American Hustle"" was identical. --- Chris ""the meme guy"" Pratt can't act. He is himself once again. --- This could be the same character from Guardians of the Galaxy and no one could tell the difference. --- Neither of them are likable and a romance between these two people is only bad celebrity shipping as the characters themselves have no personality of their own. --- Nothing is more disgusting than a romance based to nothing but feels. --- These characters have no depth whatsoever. --- ""Let's kiss and be happy and get married."" --- It is nauseous, cheesy and proves that this movie is aimed for hopeless romantics with no sense of reality. --- They are basically force-feeding sugar for 2 hours. What an experience that was. --- All in all the writing is comparable to generic princess dream only 6 years old girl could have. tl;dr:If you are okay with ""I have feels"" then there is a small chance that you won't find this movie unwatchable. If you have any kind of understanding of romance films, sci-fi and reality, you better skip this one."
" Stolkholm Syndrome the Movie
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,3,"If you were a lady who woke-up out of cryo-sleep early on a big starship, and found the only other person around was a creepy white dude who has read all about you. What would be your natural reaction? Well the mostly male writers at Hollywood, having clearly never met a human female in real life, seem to think a woman in this situation would immediately assume the guy has nothing to hide and start screwing him.She doesn't investigate, she doesn't try to wake-up anyone else. She doesn't try to find out why the pods malfunctioned. She doesn't check the other pods systematically to see if this guy is a serial killer who is waking-up and killing off female passengers. (which would actually be a more interesting plot.) Nope, she just hooks up with him like there is nothing weird or creepy at all about his situation.And then when a robot tells her that the guy woke her up intentionally, what does she do? Keep it to herself, form a plan. Nope. Hollywood thinks that all women do is throw tantrums. Because apparently in this world women are not afraid at all of being stranded alone in space with a mentally unstable impulsive man. She isn't afraid at all that if he knows, she knows, he might do something even more insane.So of course while these dip-sticks have been prancing about playing with toys, instead of using their brains to investigate their problems, the ship starts to loose power. At this point, conveniently a commander who actually has some intelligence is brought out of cryo-sleep. (something the creepy-guy could have done at the start of the film if he had had even a tiny amount of perseverance to get the doors of the command deck open.) The commander is like, ""why have you guys been messing about for two years while the ship is falling apart?"". Then dies form cryo poisoning or some bull-dust.At this point the creep and the dumb-blonde put their differences aside to mend the ship and save their asses. Which they somehow manage to do despite, zero technical training. I mean I'm assuming starships are a little more complex than just, switching it off and back on again right? Not in Hollywood they ain't.Due to some minor tension when the guy has to open a vent, Blondie forgives him entirely for ruining her life and bounces back into his arms. They discover that a medical pod can put one of them back into cryo-sleep for the rest of the journey, thus saving them from a life of loneliness. At this point we are expected to believe that the crazy creepy guy, who just risked everything to save his own skin,(he wasn't doing it for the 5000 passengers that's for sure) gives up the pod to Blondie.Now this is the only part of the film that is plausible. Blondie refuses to go into cryo-sleep, which is 100% in-line with her character of a person who makes really poor decisions based entirely on emotion. (Any other person would have vented the creep out of an airlock, and enjoyed a nice fat book deal at the end of their cryo-sleep.)"
" A romcom disguised as a sci-fi flick
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,2,"This movie borders on false advertising; I thought I'd be watching a sci-fi movie. Instead, you're getting a romantic comedy that feels like it's going on forever bundled with numerous scientific inaccuracies (why don't the spacesuits have thrusters? This is current gen technology). Overall, a film for the masses, a waste of time for the rest."
" Sorry, but this is just an average movie
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,5,"I have seen this movie cast and decided not to watch it, than a week later in boredom I watched the trailer, and confirmed that it is not good enough to spend 2 hours on. Another 2 weeks later I opened user ratings here on IMDb and saw 3 full pages of glittering reviews and I buckled. I should have listened to myself. It was not worth my time. I found myself hovering my mouse over the forward button deliberating fast forwarding in some barely digestible parts of this experience.Don't get me wrong. I love sci-fi. Even mediocre sci-fi amuses me tremendously. But this was just a cheap melodrama in a sci-fi suit.Interesting story premise, with some science in there. Toss it in an unimaginative future where society seems mostly like today and send someone a century into the future in the future to another planet leaving his life behind, and don't explore that crazy concept in the movie at all but focus on a melodramatic cheap love story with bad acting and you have The Passengers.While effects and camera work are good acting is just bellow par. Especially by Jeniffer Lawrence. I'm sorry to any fans but she is just a bad actress. I never saw a good roll of hers. Yes, Hollywood had some good movies with bad actors but they were at least actors with strong or interesting character. She has absolutely no personality and seem that therefor she can't assume one either. I could for instance imagine Gwyneth Paltrow in her younger days just giving amazing performance in this roll, though.But focus on the melodrama here, and having science and interesting story just like background stage is just bad choice and makes the whole movie pretty unbelievable and cringe worthy.Toss in some melodramatic music over some scenes and you just might get sick of your pop-corn."
" Visual Candy
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,6,"Must be seen big screen - or at least a really big screen in your man cave. Great sci-fi and sets. More plot holes than Swiss cheese. People have pointed out the science nonsense, so I won't, but there is lots. Just suspend (everything) and enjoy. I read that Jennifer Lawrence made almost twice as much as Chris Pratt. She earned that percentage. When he sticks to action, like Jurassic World, it works. Here, he has to act and justify his emotional reactions... nope. Odd staring passes for acting I guess. To me he came off more as a stalker or just creepy than as a hero. It doesn't matter that his selfish choices turned out to be irrelevant in the end.Plot: 5200 people on a 120 year suspended animation flight to colonize a new planet. Two wake up. They spent money on the CG and salaries. It could have been a 10 page short story. Still great fun to watch, but I had to keep shutting down synapses that objected to the implausibilities. Go see and be entertained."
" Terrific idea serves my guilty pleasure
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,7,"All right, everybody seems to hate this flick and I know the reasons. Everybody that saw the film knows it. But I so enjoyed the idea of a guy who doesn't want to spend his entire life alone in a spaceship so he cruelly condemns someone to make him company. It's so god damned philosophical! Think about it!Though I do know that it gets ruined after they got ""hollywoodrized"": the old ""boy gets girl"" as a solution. If Warner had invited unscrupulous directors like Paul Verhoeven and Michael Haneke, who'd identify with the project, they'd have the guts to make a terrific film from this terrific idea.I voted 8 to what this film could've been. So yes, that's my guilty pleasure of 2016."
" Its good, it almost became great but it doesn't quite get there.
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,5,"Two Strangers. Infinite Space. 90 Years on the clock.PASSENGERS left me feeling is rather flustering. The sci-fi genre has taken a toll over the past few years and I had my reservations moving onto this one. If memory serves me right the last movie of this genre that had me glued to my seat was PROMETHEUS which is nearly half a decade ago. Directed by Morten Tyldum (THE IMITATION GAME) and written by Jon Spaights (PROMETHEUS), for the more experienced viewer PASSENGERS already is a must see. If this doesn't sell it, then the following name drop may? Academy Award winner Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt (Jurassic World) concocts an amicable performance as the Avalon (aka large spaceship) carries 5000 passengers and is en- route to a new planet, Homestead II. Possibly because the earth became too crowded or entirely unlivable (I wouldn't know). A journey of some 120-ish years between them. The entire crew and passengers are in hibernation and is supposed to woken up automatically approximately 4a months before arrival at Homestead II. An unexpected disturbance in the flight path results a sleep-pod to malfunction and awakens Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) 90 years in advance. Now if this does not make you want to watch this, I am not too sure what else about this movie will.All by your self, in an unknown environment where the only option for survival is falling back into sleep. This is the best part of the movie. PASSENGERS takes off so well and displays bizarre potential from the get-go. Every minutes of the CASTAWAY experience of Jim is intriguing and then it spirals. Everything else here on-down is a slow demise of beautifully introduced movie. His heart unquestionably is in the right place as Spaights makes the effort to capture the essence of the plot in the script. Just like the Avalon, the plot is lost in an abyss. The plot explored too many avenues that the worthy acting and the above average CGI could not keep the seams stitched together (Should have stuck to one storyline). There is beauty at first, firing the right cylinders in our minds and then swiftly deviates from situation to situation leaving everything behind half baked and eventually losing its potential of being something major. VerdictIts good, it almost became great but it doesn't quite get there.TITLE: PASSENGERS DIRECTED BY: MORTEN TYLDUM STARRING: JENNIFER LAWRENCE AND CHRIS PRATT RATED: PG13 RATING: 05/10 RUNTIME: 120 MINUTES"
" ""Passengers""- An average Sci-Fi drama that is sadly more notable for the debate it has stirred about critic and audience perception than it is for its actual quality.
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,6,"The fascinating thing about director Morten Tyldum's Sci-Fi drama ""Passengers"" is that it's become more a news-story than a movie. A symbol that perfectly surmises something that had become a highly debated subject by the time of its release in late 2016- that being the difference in opinion between professional film critics and the average movie-going audience. In a year filled with high profile duds that were beloved by fans despite their debatable poor quality and equally poor professional reception (I'm looking at you, ""Batman V Superman"", and I still am not ready to forgive you for letting me down!) and decent enough releases that were dismissed by audiences despite positive critical reception, the disconnect between what critics enjoy and what audiences love has turned into a hot-button topic. Even skimming through the first few pages of reviews here shows plenty of people whose focus seems to be more on ""disproving the critics"" than discussing the film itself. It's become such an issue for so many that people are more obsessed with the Rotten Tomatoes score for the film than with the film itself.As a genre fan, I've always found these debates pretty fascinating, since many of the films I enjoy tend to be those that are often looked down on and dismissed outright by the mainstream. But I can understand why and accept that everyone's tastes are different. And in the case of ""Passengers""... well, I hate to say it, but the film is almost more fascinating for raising these discussions and debates than anything else. On it's own, it's merely an enjoyable but very average Sci-Fi drama that boasts strong performances in the service of a very standard and even bland storyline.Chris Pratt stars as Jim Preston, a passenger on-board the spaceship Avalon, who is accidentally awakened from hibernation 30 years into a 120 voyage to an Earth-like planet called Homestead II. Helpless and alone, he spends months trying to find a way to reactive his hibernation pod to no avail, before discovering and falling in love with a fellow passenger named Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence), learning about her through video-logs taken before the Avalon's departure. After spending months contemplating the dubious morality of awakening another passenger and sentencing them to a fate of possibly dying before reaching their destination, Jim decides to awaken Aurora and lie to her with the claim that her pod malfunctioned. Although shocked and heartbroken by her situation, she soon takes a liking to Jim and they quickly become lovers... but their connection is threatened when she learns the truth, and when a series of events occurs that may lead to the destruction of the Avalon.Contrary to the common complaint that the questionable and troubling morality of the story is a negative, I actually thought it lent a lot of weight and drama to the proceedings. The film is most certainly at its strongest during its first half, which are almost exclusively focused on small character moments involving the increasingly- troubled Jim as he debates awakening Aurora, and their eventual sort-of courtship. The fact that Jim in a way is sort-of murdering her by taking her life away is a very strong theme, and I enjoyed it. Especially given the expert performances of the delightful Pratt and Lawrence, who are both acting their hearts out, and director Tyldum's strong visual direction.Unfortunately, like many stories that start strong and put their focus almost exclusively on character, the film completely collapses in its second half, which is where it loses major points for me. Rather than simply telling a unique character-study about two people put into an extraordinary situation, the film then tries to saddle us with a series of increasingly convoluted plot-twists and developments and unnecessarily complicate matters, and it robs much of the drama and suspense. Basically, the first half is solid... the second half is a flippin' mess. It trades in the atmosphere of the earlier sequences for big, loud explosions and non-stop CGI-heavy effects sequences. And it gets rid of the quiet and contemplative moments of character development for every predictable suspense cliché in the book. And it almost ruins the entire film, dragging down what was otherwise a very decent drama and turning it into an average, run-of-the-mill sci-fi thriller where suspension of disbelief goes right out the window and you're left scratching your head at all the conveniences and plot- holes that pop up. It's really a shame.As it stands, ""Passengers"" definitely has enough going for it in terms of strong performances, good visuals and an intriguing first- half that I would still give it a slight recommendation. But my suggestion? Once you hit the one-hour mark, you can basically stop paying attention. The first half of the film is quite well-constructed... the second half is just bland and predictable. And as a result, like I said above... it's almost more fascinating to watch for the debate it affords about critic vs audience perception than anything else.I give it an average 6 out of 10."
" Barely Science Fiction and a waste of leads
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,3,"Some have called this ""A rape fantasy"" (incorrect), a Stockholm Syndrome film (maybe) and Creepy (in parts). I call it mostly dull, since it drags in parts and barely science fiction (for reasons since I don't want to write spoilers, I won't go into depth). But there's barely any science to the science fiction - as any sf fan who watches this - especially the reactor vent scene - will see. While the leads are good together, I found the story un-involving and the premise as well as the sappy ending, silly. With a little work this could have been really good, but as it is, it's barely worth watching once. I keep hoping Hollywood would simply allow a great sf movie like Ex Machina to be made, but they keep failing the viewer and then wring their hands, wondering what went wrong."
" Let me save your time
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,1,"To put it in very simple terms, highest scores are from females under 18. With that in mind you can already see where this is going.The only intelligent part about this movie was the fact that they managed to create a teen flick that makes it easy to convince the boyfriend to come along and watch it. And that is achieved by making a teen romance take place in space, with lot's of special effects, a male lead character and a compelling premise of a minimalist and polished future that looks as empty as today's teen generation.Absolute garbage from a decaying Hollywood, with no creativity, who's only goal is to make money, no matter what.Sad part is that people still buy it."
" The trailer creates a wrong idea what the movie is about
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,7,"First off the movie itself is decent. Acting, CGI, sound effects, ideas are all good and fun to watch.But this movie also has a big problem: It is not what the trailer points out to.After the trailer I thought there would be some kind of social experiment, aliens attack, a conspiracy or whatsoever going on. When the real plot can be put into one sentence: ""During a 120 year journey to another planet a ship gets damaged by a meteorite and wakes up 1 unlucky guy because of a malfunction (who luckily is a mechanic) to repair the ship and prevent the destruction of the ship containing over 5000 people on board - the End."" Yeah well of course there is this romantic component with Jlaw and it is fun to watch, but I would have liked to know up in front that this movie is a romantic drama. A good one yes, but still why create false hopes with the trailer? And you burn Andy Garcia for 5 seconds screen time?? Is this a joke? There was so much more potential, and so much more interesting things that could've been told. But instead this movie wants to make us think about the questions: What is a good life? What is so important about other people? What happens if we are truly lonely? Would we make ourselves feel better, by destroying other peoples lives? Or is this all interpretation and POV?conclusion: wrong trailer / still a decent movie."
" Original idea
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,7,"İf you like to see space related films and you get bored cliche's then you are at the right place. Not so shocking but absolutely worth to watch. Male head artist is not so shiny but Lawrence is magnificent. Especially space defined beautifully and you want to be there. Film gives the idea that you are all alone in a border less space. Graphics is good, music is the soft side of the film. it can be much more atmospheric and maybe the rating is much more higher than now. the concept is genius although it is not emotionally deep enough. It is a fantastic creepy start, and while Lawrence and he undeniably possess the magic spark of screen chemistry, the basic creepiness of this cute extinguishes what the producers presumably are hoping is a warm fuzzy glow of sparky interaction. Stalking tactics bolstering romantic comedies are by no means new, and over the decades, Producers have proved adept at somehow planing down world nastiness, but here it's gruesomely inescapable."
" It is possible to have drama, romance, and political relevancy set in space. This does not.

This does not.As stated millennia ago by Aristotle: Plot, Character, Thought, Diction (language), Song (Music), Spectacle.Removing the first three, and making spectacle first, gets you Passengers. Every failing already mentioned by other reviewers relates to this. Formulaic, contrived, at times foolish, and unsure of it's intent -- other than to provide spectacle. I'm always reticent to condemn writers as I know how corporate interference can neuter creativity. Still, this progresses like a flow chart of clichéd movie writing sub-routines."

" Unexpected Gem
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,8,"This film was not like I expected, it was better. Imagine the idea of waking up to a better life, only to realize that a stranger has stolen it from you? Then realize he's also stolen the opportunity to see or connect with another human being for the rest of your days? All because of his own selfish loneliness.As Jennifer Lawrence comes to terms with her own mortality on a floating piece of tin, Chris Pratt tries to come to terms with his ""crime"" while desperately trying to find a way to redeem himself.While it is a love story in deep space, it's done in a unique and engaging way.I'm also mindful of the bartender Arthur (played by Michael Sheen)creeeeepy! Possibly a tribute to a similar bartender aka the shining, which kind of adds another layer to the film.Definitely worth the watch!"
" Solid Movie
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,7,"Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence are probably the two most in demand personalities right now in Hollywood. They are so likable, all their promotional interviews were an absolute blast to watch and never a dull moment too. So you can imagine my shock to hear how badly this movie was being reviewed. Ten minutes later I realised these are the snobby critic reviews who love hipster garbage and just swing towards controversial nonsense that has a political theme to them. A sci-fi Romance is not their thing. So I withheld judgement until I watched it for myself. This movie is....solid! I admit it did not blow me away but neither was it bad in the slightest. Reminiscent of the classic Titanic in space theme but without leaving you with your mouth open in aw. Whilst ""Epic"" in its scale, set design and in plot. For some reason this film to me missed its mark in making me feel terrified for these characters. I believe part of my problem personally was that I watched too many interviews with Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence together. Their chemistry off screen seemed so genuine and funny, like they were truly good friends. When i saw them together on screen I couldn't imagine them together romantically anymore and the writing for these characters were no where near as good as their dialogue together in real life. In a weird way i felt more intensity between them off screen then on screen. In the build up to this movie they advertised it suggesting there is an ultimate reason they woke up from their hibernation pods, that their is a plot twist or cliff hanger we are waiting on throughout the movie. Are they all going to die? is there really a planet on the other side of this mission? What could the reason be? However in the first scene of the movie you see what happens for Jims pod to malfunction and him to wake up. It was not a dramatic opening, you watch it thinking ""Yeh i guess that's what happens in space, should have built a better ship"". From then you can guess how Aroura's pod opens for her to wake up. It came about without shock but with ease. So by the end of the movie you look back and there is no moment that stands out as ""wow! I can't believe that"". It is all very typical. The pacing of this movie is strange too, in about 20 minutes of the movie you watch a year pass by. Then in the middle of the movie you watch another year pass by. In the final act you watch it as if it is real time, like a ticking time bomb that needs defusing in 10 minutes. Yet when you watch the movie, I don't really buy into it. I just think how they stuck a fake beard on Jims face and how they say the key words here and there to represent natural romantic progression. Having said all this the plot is good. Ultimately you know whats happening but you like it none the less because it is charming, it is romantic, it is funny and it takes place on a beautiful set. Yes the set design is phenomenal. Which brings me on to the action scenes. There is one scene that makes this film from dropping down to a 6/10. That's the pool scene. I wont give away what happens but when you watch it you empathise right away with the situation and you feel the panic as to what is happening. It is executed perfectly and is a great feet in stunt design. The performance by Michael Sheen is probably the best in the film. Not to take away from the lead pair, but I felt he had the most to work with, playing a robot that is their at human disposal. to remain neutral to all things yet offer a sense of calmness/creepiness and charm all at once. A great job by him. I also enjoyed the ending to this movie. Although there is nothing here to make you stand up and applause. You leave with a smile on your face feeling good. Which is a lot more than most films can offer. Overall this movie was Solid. It could have been so much more and equally could have become absolute rubbish."
" A great surprise
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,7,"Having seen the reviews ahead of time I was fully prepared for disappointment. This most likely factored in my score as I was pleasantly surprised. I'm also a sucker for isolation movies and books so I was an easy target. I thought the pacing was just right. Whenever I felt like a chapter had run its course, another one would pick right up. Chris Pratt was much more reserved in this role compared to others, making it easier to get invested. Jennifer Lawrence didn't quite hit with me right away, but grew on me as the movie progressed. There are some glaring points of absolute convenience, a couple inconsistencies, and a little cheesiness, but it was a fun ride nonetheless."
" Turkey
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,2,"A Lost-in-Space love story that lacks any science fiction or romantic drama bona fides. Little is expected from either Lawrence or Pratt, and they deliver in kind. Characters lack credibility, (except for maybe Arthur the android), which is the only thing saving the plot from being utterly predictable. You know you're in trouble when Laurence Fishburne shows up to save the day and can't. Visually stunning big screen production design does not translate to the small screen. Visually stunning actors are about the only thing that might make this turkey appealing. And both Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt can be seen in numerous other projects where their talent is showcased as least as much as their looks."
" Passengers of Life
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,8,"Previously, it seems strange to me that a well-made picture like Passengers has an average rating of only 7.0. Later, however, it comes to me that maybe many people who went to the cinema were expecting a marvelous science fiction film but eventually come to find a typical romance instead. In passengers, though high-tech future elements can be seen anywhere, they are mainly used to support the love story the movie wants to convey, not to provoke dramatic intensity and visual effects as normal sci-fi movies do. And so if you are looking for something rather tense and incredible, the film might not satisfy you enough, for the story is told in a slow pace and the highlight around the end is a little roughly-arranged. But on the other hand, Passengers has reached high in telling a romantic story and has also brought out thinking and arguments about humanity and attitudes towards life.Space movies are sci-fi films set in a particular environment: outer space, which always provides the films with potential advantages. They include: infinity in setting the background's scale, great convenience in testing humanity under extreme circumstances such as facing the unknown, and sometimes, expense saving by hiring only a few actors and actresses. Generally speaking, Passengers has made full use of many of these potentials to make itself worth viewing and thinking. It has had its background set on a lonely spaceship traveling in the void, providing a single concentrated scene, to tell clear and straight a fascinating story about no more than two main characters. Such a genius idea that supports the film has also enabled some thinking on the two characters' different attitudes and decisions towards their fate and destiny.Apart from a brilliant idea, there are, of course, other contributing factors that has made the movie come to life. Firstly, I must say the acting of Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence is really great. Pratt expressed strongly the character's sense of loneliness at particular scenes, while Lawrence stroke me hard in acting extreme emotions such as hatred, despair and eagerness (I actually recall seeing similar vivid acting in other films with Lawrence playing a role such as The Hunger Games series as well). Besides, the visual effects of the film is beautiful, which has definitely added more flavor to the already beautiful story. The music written for the picture is also worth praising too, although I'm a little surprised it is so great as to get the Oscar nomination.As mentioned above, Passengers may not have done so well as a science fiction film. But I think it truly has achieved something in telling a love story. We have already seen countless romance films which consists little more than a boy and a girl come to a kiss after a series of things happen. If such plain and simple love stories with few details and never-changing happy endings were once popular, they can hardly surprise us any more nowadays. Because with the development of modern movies, we are asking something more besides two good-looking people come together. We are asking questions like: What happened next? How their individuality affected their relationship? What's their understanding of love?Good romance films are seeking the answers, and trying to give complete new angles of telling romantic stories. One way of doing so, some find, is to extend the perspective of love from the traditional honeymoon period to the entire life of the ones in love. Passengers, among some others like The Titanic (1997) , Up (2009) and About Time (2013) have looked into this method of story- telling, and many of them reached tremendous effect. They carry the theme that love consists not only a rush, a glance, a touch, a dance. Love is Life. (Please allow me to quote from the song 'City of Stars' without thinking it lower than any others) In Passengers, by illustrating opinions of life from the characters' view, it has shared its unique perspective of love with accuracy.*** Some friends may consider the lines below spoilers ***In the end, I would like to add another quote from Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's master piece 'The Little Prince', which I think suits the main idea of the film pretty well: People on the train are pursuing nothing at all. They are asleep in there, or if they are not asleep they are yawning. Only the children are flattening their noses against the windowpanes.We are all passengers of life. Besides chasing a destination, there are so many wonders on the way for us to stop by. If the ultimate goal is so far to reach, we can still make a meaningful path by enjoying every bit of the day."
" A Little Something for BOTH sexes!
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,7,"Great date night movie. Probably will not be what you expect. I hate science fiction but this movie is much more than just some silly flick with spaceships and outer space. The plot is fresh, surprising, and unique.Jennifer Lawrence ,as always, is on point and gives the viewer their moneys worth. Phenomenal ""Star Wars"" quality sets and special effects. I imagine the majority of the movie's budget went towards special effects, computerization and props. This flick probably just reset the standards.Take a chance on this flick. You will be glad that you did and it might just make your list of favorites!"
" The design of star ship Avalon might not be inspired by Sycamore tree seed at all !
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,8,"The designer of Avalon said that he was inspired by the shape of a Sycamore tree seed falling from the sky. However, I've seen an object which had almost the identical shape in some other sci-fi movie, 'Oblivion' In that movie, there was a cabin by a hidden lake, to which Jack (Tom Cruise) visited from time to time. On top of that cabin was a windmill-like structure and it had almost the same shape with that of the star ship Avalon. If you don't remember that, you might visit my blog to see for yourself.http://progmachine.blog.me/220933100784 (Sorry, it's in Korean only) Anyway, the movie was fantastic !"
" an inter-stellar love story
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,7,"Spacecraft undertaking long journeys between the stars have become one of the sets favorite movies and television series about the second half of the 60s, with the entry in production of serials like 'Star Trek' and some major big screen movies as '2001: a Space Oddissey' directed by Stanley Kubrick. Smaller and larger studios added to their sets to apartments in Manhattan, wild west villages and saloons or columns of the Roman forums, the corridors and cabins passenger space travel as scenery and props were used and reused. While these sets were diversified, specialized and differentiated by gender, some of them represented true artistic creations, an example being the series 'Alien' with sets drawn by Swiss surrealist artist Hans Rudolph (HR) Giger.'Passengers' directed by Norwegian Morten Tyldum on a screenplay by Jon Spaihts is happening on such a spacecraft called Avalon. (The name comes from the Celtic mythology and Arthurian story exactly, is the name of the island where the legendary sword Excalibur was created). It is a huge shuttle carrying 5000 passengers toward the settlement Homestead II located far away from Earth. What is different from post-apocalyptic movies, we are warned from the beginning that this settlement is the result of a decision taken in an orderly manner and that everything is OK on Earth. In fact, it seems to be a peaceful period in human evolution, without internal conflicts and external threats. So there is room for romance. And in fact, this is what 'Passengers' is - a love story that happens in interstellar space.The journey should last 120 years, and is performed at a cruising speed which is half the speed of light. That means that those who embark on this adventure forever leave their home world, friends and family. Even if taking a return voyage the day after arrival at Homestead II would find upon returning to Earth a humanity oldest 240 years plus time 'compressed' due to travel at speeds comparable to the speed of light (this Conformity theory of relativity) . Achieving such speeds is currently beyond the capabilities of the technology, although known theoretically at least two types of engines (photon propulsion and antimatter) that can be used in the future. Inside the spacecraft imagined by filmmakers combine utilitarianism technical (individual cryogenic cells, a bridge where access is allowed only to the authorized crew, an engine room similar to the engine room ocean liners) and shared space with different sections with comfort differentiated according to social classes . Kind of like a giant Titanic, with a better service and menu afforded only by passengers who have paid the tickets more expensive. That mankind may not have acute internal problems or external conflicts, but the differences between social classes they were not erased this future described by writer 'Passengers'. As a consolation, the bar is still free for all passengers and serviced by an android (played by Michael Sheen) who is a good conversationalist (sometimes a little too chatty) and a gentleman. The exterior of the spacecraft is equipped with a protective shield which should defend the ship, of any meteorological nuisance such as star storms or meteor populated areas. All is well until a problem occurs, and among its consequences, a passenger, a mechanical engineer from Colorado named Jim Preston (actor Chris Pratt is called) is awakened too early. Specifically after ""only"" 30 years, 90 years before arriving at their destination, which means in practice that he will never reach there.The love story between the mechanical engineer played by Chriss Pratt and the New York journalist played the beautiful actress Jennifer Lawrence is the centerpiece of the story. It's a story about guilt, because the heroine was actually awakened intentionally by the hero after more than a year and loneliness, which triggers the romantic story but kills the possibility that she ever reaches their destination. I will not reveal more than that and I will not say the connection seemed to me not too convincing despite some scenes filmed very well, and that the last part of the story slips in spatial action drama with not too many original features.I loved in this movie some of the cinematographic images. I saw the movie in 3D, but it should be quite spectacular in 2D as well. Splendid are the scenes inside where a couple of young heroes have at hand a whole (not sinking) Titanic where they are the only ones awake with other 4998 passengers plunged into a deep sleep. Sensational scenes are mostly the one outside the spaceship, where heroes - if we continue the parallel - observe from the deck liner the entire interstellar universe.In conclusion - a more than reasonable science fiction film, a romantic story that takes place in special circumstances and surroundings which may not be that convincing at the end of the day as romance, but the moments of great beauty reward those who undertake the viewing experience."
" must watch for sci-fi movie
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,7,"But Passengers suffocates under the pressure of its own premise. Once everything is set up in the first 25-or-so minutes, the story, just like its protagonists, gets stuck in space with nowhere to go. It digresses, forcing two human characters into becoming heroes, nay, proficient astronauts!Its dialogue fails it miserably; the lovable characters could have been given smarter lines, but instead, we're stuck with obvious observations like, ""Oh no, I woke up too soon!"" Yeah, we know.Passengers is Hollywood's answer to the star-studded Bollywood blockbusters of the 70s, where anything and everything could happen because it was happening to big stars on screen. Here too, it's mostly only Pratt and Lawrence who manage to keep you in your seat.It's a great-looking film with an original idea. Watch it for its stars but it won't have an astronomical impact on you."
" Passengers - A Re-imagined Sleeping Beauty
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,7,"This film was certainly different to anything I'd ever seen before. Set in space - brilliant. Good looking guy doing some heavy lifting - why not. Beautiful girl lying down, unmoving - isn't that how we all like our women? A threat to thousands of unsuspecting, very unhelpful people - if you don't have that, do you even have a movie? As you can see all very unique and completely new aspects of film-making, really pushing the film industry in a new direction. Opening minds. Broadening horizons.You may have heard of some of our main mans films, Bride Wars, Jennifer's Body, Five-Year Engagement, and his most famous part to date, a little television series, that I believe picked up quite a following, known simply as Parks and Recreation. Christ Pratt may seem a like a foreign name to you now, but mark my words young children, this man could be something, if only some movie director would give him a chance, in say a Marvel superhero movie. But hey, that's just my uneducated opinion.The unmoving girl referred to earlier, is played by that chick who, I want to say, was in that movie where everyone had to kill each other? The one with all the weapons. You know which one I'm talking about. It was directed by Quentin Tarentino? No? Then she was definitely in that film with the guy who was in The Godfather and that other guy who was in those stupid Hangover movies. (Speaking of the Hangover movies, if you haven't seen Obama on Between Two Ferns pop onto The Youtube and educate yourself.) You know the one I'm talking about. He's always in all those Jennifer Lawrence films. Argh, for the life of me, I just can't seem to think of her name.Moving right along then. I'm surprised more people haven't caught on that Passengers is basically a re-imagined Sleeping Beauty. Aurora (Lawrence) is woken up by Jim (Pratt), and they are hurtling through space at horrific speeds upon the spaceship, Avalon, a name for a Disney kingdom if ever I heard one, and a kingdom they sure do make. The catalyst that sends them on their journey to save the entire unsuspecting, still sleeping, inhabitants of the ship should've been named Maleficent. Even though it's portrayal of the evil fairy wasn't nearly as good as Angelina Jolie's, at least it gave it the good old college try.The character development throughout the film was a bit so-so, even though the whole time Pratt and Lawrence's characters were playing out their love story I couldn't help thinking; 'But he's with Anna Farris! That makes him unqualified to be with her.' (See what I did there? Do you see it?)You do however, get to see the motive behind their reasoning for being on the ship, and the film does introduce some interesting prospects of the future for the human race. And even though the differences and struggles between classes is played in a humorous light, it does however, suggest that perhaps we, as a species, will always struggle with class hierarchy and the implications that money brings into the conversation of class structure and entitlements. Or perhaps, like a high-school English teacher, I'm reading too much into it and the references to differences in class is simply to make it more relatable to the intended audience.The supporting acts were played brilliantly, especially the robot barman, Arthur, whose brilliant conversation drove the film when it could very easily have been quite boring. The question left to ask is: where do I get myself one of those?The film was throwing the popcorn in the general direction of your mouth and missing good. The suspense really had you on the edge of your seat, and the love story and following conflict between such a small central cast was displayed brilliantly and certainly showed off each actors ability to lie to large audiences. And don't even get me started on the cinematography. It was vastly, brilliantly and universally wonderful. Pun most definitely intended."
" A sci Fi must watch!
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,10,"I would first like to say that they chose a great cast for this movie. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence where excellent in their roles. Well as far as this story it was well written. There was a little bit of everything, comedy, action, drama, romance. The special effects are outstanding. The design of the ship was beautiful. I don't know what rating the ""critics"" have this film but all I can say is that I watched it 4 times already because I enjoyed it so much.this story was like being a castaway on a deserted island. I understand Jim's dilemma. If I was marooned on a huge starship with a 90 year sentence, with no one to talk to except an Android bartender with limited social skills. I think I would've woken up the most beautiful woman also. But with my luck she's a hardcore lesbian."
" nope nope nope.
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,2,"this movie should have been titled ""HOT WHITE PEOPLE IN SPACE""I really was expecting a fun sci-fi ride, with aspects of romance from two Hollywood stars i generally really enjoy watching. ...I've never been so disappointed in either of their performances! it was laughably stupid and poorly acted. at first I thought, ""oh, OK, its a comedy.. wasn't exactly expecting that."" then... it moved into darker territory and i thought..""OK... Chris Pratt rotting away alone on a space ship with a goofy beard...."" then as soon as Jlaw came into it, the movie dive-bombed into idiocy and boring semi-romantic garbage. I thought her acting was unbelievable and boring, their chemistry was laughable... (but to be fair that might be because i know they are friends in real life and Chris Pratt and his wife are the cutest couple alive..)SO MAYBE IM BIASED... but i still didn't believe them as a couple. i didn't believe any of the plot line. SO MANY HOLES! i wont go into the depth of holes, as I'm not a sci-fi expert by any means, but EVEN I knew that the science and reasoning was stupid. it was fun to look at..... that's about all i can say for it. Jennifer has perfect hair and cute outfits, Chris Pratt is handsome as heck with his signature goofy quality... some of the computer graphics were fun. but i'd say ultimately, don't waste your time."
" Fun, until you start thinking about the flaws
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,6,"I kind of enjoyed this movie for the sheer fantasy of it. It's one of those movies where you can imagine yourself in place of the actor and ask yourself ""what would I do?"" The problem is that what you think you would do is probably much more exciting than what the film delivers.Mainly though, it's just fun to think about being alone in space with Jennifer Lawrence. The plot is simple, and the action is standard. This film unfortunately offers no real surprises. It is utterly formulaic. It's the kind of film where you guess what's going to happen next, and that's exactly what happens - and you wish it hadn't, because you really, really want to like it and have it take you on a journey. It's a pretty film, but not a very smart one. Kind of like Chris Pratt."
" Not recommended
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,5,"The movie seemed far below the Hollywood standards that you expect from a decent fiction film.At some point, it became over-dramatic and unwarranted romance.There were some glimpses here and there, which showed that the plot had potential, but it digressed a lot and strayed away from the fiction and turned into a romantic flick.It completely failed to build up the technical details behind various events and it sort of just made things happen as neededNot recommended to watch unless a movie with nice cinematography is all what it takes to excite you to watch one."
" Oh boy, how did they do that
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,7,"So movie could be separated in three different categories as it moves along. Firstly visually movie looks superb, it really shines all the way around and it looks really futuristic and advanced. After Jim wakes up and up until the moment it turns into a romance it was quite interesting to look around and see how a person deals with loneliness. So year has passed and now he fell in love with a Aurora and there is idea of waking her up, so he did that and now movie instantly become a romance. As they slowly fall in love with each other and they are doing everything together and year has passed Jim decides to propose to Aurora but after he leaves things go down. Android that is bartender told Aurora she has been woken and now they continue to live their lives separately. There are some hints that ship is failing slowly and this is third genre that kicks in. Thriller that now moves along is quite not interesting and it just wants to be more dramatic, more visually better but it was not even smart. Ending of the movie when everybody actually gets awake is pretty nice and it has some lightness inside but considering everything before it was too many trouble to achieve something like that. Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt were fine. They just did their job in doing best and that was it. 2.5/4"
" Food for thought
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,8,"The first thing I read about «Passengers» is that it was a poorly made movie, with an equal poor plot.After seeing the movie I can only tell the so-called professionals: Pure Hogwash.Passengers is actually a good movie, with a good plot. Morten Tyldum has done a good job, and John Spaihts has written a good script full of suspense, intense and interesting ideas and questions.The many philosophical questions raised in the plot are highly interesting and are well worth pondering.Most important is not whether it could happen or not, but of course What would you have done in this situation. It is not a question of whether it is possible – but if it was possible, what would the solution to the various quandaries be.If you want not only good entertainment, but also food for thought, this is two hours well worth spending in the darkness of the theater."
" Passengers
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,5,"As I have probably mentioned on this blog previously I am always sceptical of a new release that has been marketed very heavily in the media. Heavy marketing campaigns can create an audience for a title that does not have a clear target market when produced. Such campaigns can also be used to cover up inevitable critical disdain towards the title. As I had found myself bombarded with Passengers posters and adverts throughout London tube stations and bus stops I assumed the latter was soon to unfold when I sat down in the cinema last week. Admittedly Passengers is a marketers dream as it stars Chris (he's so hot right now) Pratt & Jennifer (she's so hot right now) Lawrence. They are both playing characters stranded aboard the ""Avalon""; a space ship travelling to a new world that the human race intend to colonise. Something goes wrong aboard the ship and both stars are woken up from their hyper sleep 100 years too early. The title starts out promisingly as we first follow Chris Pratt's character Jim Preston; an engineer who wakes from hyper sleep over a year before Jennifer Lawrence's character Aurora. The first half of the title is more or less a one-man show as we follow Jim wandering the ship alone struggling to survive. This first act of the film manages to hit the highs of other sci-fi isolation titles such as I Am Legend & Moon. I was beginning to think my initial impressions of the title were going to be proved wrong. This first act is a funny, heart-warming and heart-breaking depiction of how a man would react in such a situation and Chris Pratt wonderfully encapsulates all of the emotions an individual would go through. Unfortunately this film begins to descend into mediocrity as soon as Jennifer Lawrence enters the scene. This is not the strong, independent woman that she has become know for in Silver Linings Playbook or even the Hunger Games. Her character Aurora is supposedly and journalist back on earth but her profession does not have any bearing on the way she behaves. What is most damaging is that her character is integral to the 'twist' of the movie but due to her nondescript and undeveloped motives the entire concept of this title simply doesn't work. Admittedly this is a fault of the writer not the actress herself but I was left very disappointed that they were unable to utilise the talents of one of the most sought after actresses in the industry.This is certainly not the disaster I was expecting when I walked into the cinema and it does have its merits. It does enough to satisfy but ultimately falls short of leaving a lasting impression. Having seen this title I have come to the conclusion that it was heavily marketed as a 'safe' box office hit based on the star power it boasted. Maybe I need to stop being such a smart arse and try to watch films without judging them based on the way they are marketed.....see more here:http://thereeltruth1.blogspot.co.uk/"
" Enjoyable view
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,7,"Quite enjoyable view in best tradition of sci-fi stories. What I liked: - special effects 10 of 10 - acting maybe 9 of 10 - story idea - whats behind - 10It's a great story, maybe somehow even modenr sci-fi Robinson Crusoe dilemma - can you live alone all life that is left for you or cannot? This dilemma was shown nicely - and you see that despise all modern comforts and having androids for a chat (somehow like Friday just clever) does not solve the issue - human being needs another being. This part of the movie I liked best. Thats the dilemma part.Romantic part - he meets she, and how this evoles when no other options in horizon. Love and betrayal - a bit cheezy part although I like romance overall.Action part - well here nothings new... bit of cliché part... no comments on here. Ending - choosing what's right for you dilemma. Happy end :)"
" The best film 2016
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,9,"This is a prime example of why you use IMDb rather than rotten Tomatoes! the visual graphics of this film are unreal- the composition of the story line is staggering, i fell in love with the way the twists and turns kept me indulged and highly motivated to carry on watching always wondering when something was going to happen. The story line almost dangled a carrot in terms of you the next big break in the equilibrium but gave you a false sense.... leaving you thinking it may never be restored and therefore setting a new equilibrium heavily going against Todorovs Theory. I love this film its one you could watch over and over! cannot stress how much you need to watch this film... watch the awards flow in ......"
" Lifetime Channel Pablum
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,1,"First, having a Cinderella story in space does not make it Sci-Fi. Second, I think Jennifer Lawrence is a fine actress, a very rich actress, and certainly did not need to make this pile of junk. I guess the film cost $110 million because of her salary and points. Good for her. Getting rich is the American Way.But unless you LIKE old Disney movies fluffed up into poor CGI and hurled into space and, after stealing the bar set from the shining and making the 'prince' a futuristic plumber, well, then skip the movie.If I didn't like my freedom, I would have hurled something heavy and pointed at the screen during the last thirty seconds of the film.Spoiler: the end should have contained hundreds of live people besides a Disney set of trees and birds and friggin butterflies (well, hyperbole aside). If they were the only two people alive hundreds of years before their intended 'wake up' time, they would have woken up more and started making babies. The ending should have included LOTS of live people running around the ship. But Noooooo...we are to just assume the two lovers got old and watched each other croak. Right.Again, this is a chic flick in space and only for chicks who love romance, and not even hot romance.Sy Fy makes better nonsense than this film."
" Horrible as science fiction and pathetic as a love story
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,1,"This is what I call a lazy script from a weak screenwriter to an interesting idea. Every good science fiction movie has to have the scientific side with a minimum of consistency. Relevant explanations, which are the premises for buying the plot, are played in some dialogues quickly and unconvincingly. In fact, it is never explained why the whole crew sleeps and they do not take turns to control the progress of the trip, and why if everyone sleeps, there is no protocol to wake up some crew members in case of emergency. Why someone who wakes up cannot hibernate again if this is the basis of the trip? Why the crewman who woke up, seeing the eminence of the ship's destruction, did not wake up any more crewmen instead of leaving all the safety of the ship in the hands of two inexperienced passengers? Why make a ship so spacious and luxurious for passengers who spend 99.9% of the trip sleeping? The more mass, the more energy and the greater the cost of travel to a company that aims for profit. If the company owned the ship was for profit, they did not think that a ship traveling at 50% of the speed of light would travel thousands of years to the future (Basic Relativity Law). The problem that caused the crash in the ship is the most basic of a stellar trip and yet it was not thought of? Otherwise, they are important premises for the plot that are simply pushed aside. All could have been properly answered and integrated into the plot by a good screenwriter. Or they should be changed. In fact the film is horrible as science fiction and pathetic as a love story."

" Don't know how to feel about it
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,6,"I decided to give a shot to Passengers, due to its delicious trailer. The movie starts pretty well: 5 minutes that will leave stuck to the screen. Well done special effects and a feeling of 'suspense' in the air of what might happen next. I was constantly wondering when Jennifer was going to show up - and that was my first disappointment. Jim talking with his ""Robot-bartender-friend"" about the dilemma of waking her up or not. This really upset me. He just read a few things about the woman (and by the way, those things showed a girl with dreams, goals and purposes) and he ""decided"" that he was in love. I know, maybe this isn't what the author meant, but it was what I saw. It would have been better if Jim couldn't bear the pressure of being alone for so long and decided to wake up someone to help him out, instead of just looking at her face in a completely forced scene. The author could have picked a number of passengers and showed us their motivations to embark on a journey of hundreds of years to a completely different space and life. And for deeper reasons, Jim would chosen Aurora. It'd have been more interesting. The ending is a disaster. They decided to stay together and live that life to which they were basically forced. I finished this movie with a knot in my stomach when I saw the others passengers waking up and the Aurora's messenger. It broke my heart. Alternative ending? Maybe she could have go back to where she was taken from. They've could say goodbye with all those clichés that the author obviously likes and she could wake up 88 years later with a unique experience to tell to the other travelers. I feel like this movie was meant to talk about love, life and solitude. But it was so predictable and obvious all the time. The key-messages are given by the bartender: ''when one is drowning, has to take someone else with him"" and also ""you can't wait for what happens next. you have to live with what you have and make the most of it"". I got them, but one more time, this was barely showed in this movie. Positive words for the movie pictures and the actors. I'm not a fan of Jennifer but I have to admit that she and Chris Patt make an attractive couple. For me this movie is like a bad cooked chocolate cake. It had all the ingredients to be wonderful, but someone didn't know how to prepare it."
" Bait and Switch Rom-Com set in Outer Space
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,3,"What a year 2016 was for cinema and particularly fans of Sci-Fi and not for the better! Indeed, Passengers was just the last in line of a list of proclaimed sci-fi films which were nothing of the sort.You see, Passengers is not a sci-fi film, it is a romantic comedy set on a spaceship. If that doesn't make sense, consider this: does a film about relationships along with some comedy necessarily make a romantic comedy? I think not. Romantic Comedy is a well defined genre along the lines of boy meets girl, love at first sight, boy does stupid, breakup, both suffer, boy does grandstanding, get her back, live happily ever after.That's Passengers. Literally.What do you put in a review about a sci-fi film which is really a romantic comedy? I am not sure, do you judge it as a romantic comedy? As a sci-fi? Passengers is not alone in this regard, Hollywood seems to recently believe that genre-bending sci-fi is some great idea. Perhaps they think that they can drop clues to both Mr. and Mrs. in the trailers and get both to go to the cinema instead of just one of them. If so, it doesn't work when you make a trailer which signals sci-fi but is really rom-com. That old salesman tactic is called Bait and Switch and we don't like it.It looks good. First 10-15 minutes is OK. That's it. Why I gave 4 stars as it is not completely boring. Actually I take it back, I give it 3 stars, because Jennifer Lawrence (who got paid twice co-lead) has a horrible vocal fry and that is just awful, vocal fry is awful, girls better to go with Valley Speak if you want an annoying way of speaking.In addition the violent attack Jlaw does on Pratt, including punches to the face is just unacceptable. In addition, if you wanted to make a smart movie perhaps let JLaw wake up and be faced with the difficult question Pratt has in this movie. Instead we get boy bad, girl good.Hollywood seemingly for profit ideas or feminist ideology seems to want to ruin Sci-Fi. Don't let them. Don't watch this movie."
" Desolation in Space
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,6,"This movie is mostly focused on the emotional status of the two main characters. Although I expected the movie to have more sci-fi and action elements when I watched the trailer, the actual storyline of the movie was about how the loneliness of Jim lead to a tragedy for Aurora but eventually saved lives of thousands of people. The action that I expected was only shown in the middle part of the movie when there was no gravity for a moment. But the problem that caused it was less exciting than I thought, and the development of story after they solved the problem was too quick and couldn't make the movie dramatic until the end.The only part about the movie that I found interesting was that Jim had to choose to wake Aurora up in order for him to live, even though he knew that it will destroy her life. The resemblance of the emptiness and the vastness of space and Jim's heart, and the nature of humans, longing to be with other humans, was clearly depicted through this kind of a situation, although I wish it could've been done more thoroughly to show the emotional status of both characters."
" Good sci-fi movie.
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,7,"Not that great but definitely good one. well, this movie is directed by the same guy who directed ""the imitation game"", the basic concept idea behind the story of this movie is really good. but the way it is shown on screenplay was not up to the mark i guess. that's where this failed. the main thing i liked the most in the movie is the visual effects, since this was 3D movie. the stunning visual effects and all the usual sci-fi stuff used in the movie were great. i liked Michael sheen who happened to play bartender role. there is good humor in this movie. and good to watch once. i thought this movie would get nominated for visual effects in academy awards. sadly it didn't. overall a OK-good kind of movie."
" Disappointment
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,5,"Well I learned not to trust the IMDb ratings after some big disappointments but I am pretty surprised a sci-fi graded over 7 would be this mediocre. it might be an OK movie only if you called it romance in space... Its quite unfortunate for the sci-fi lovers like me, i wish they wouldn't call it sci-fi just because it is in a spaceship and that moves in space...I'm glad i didn't waste the money to go see this in a movie place.I seek logic in sci-fi otherwise it is not satisfactory... My turnoff in this movie is as follows... 5000 people are in a 120 year journey in a huge spaceship, when a hibernation pod malfunctions after the first 30 years, a single guy awakens but outside in the entire spaceship all human life support systems are available... if all r supposed to be sleeping for 90 more years none should be available including oxygen, gravity control and food production..."
" Can understand the lovers and haters
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,6,"This movie would have been perfectly enjoyable to many more viewers if it had been a non Hollywood film featuring less known actors/actresses. Seeing Jennifer Lawrence and Christ Pratt on the trailer with all the polish of glistening special effects does tend to shape one's expectations before going in to see the movie. Unfortunately, the movie straddles the middle, not quite satisfying the high-action, endorphin-driven space odyssey lovers, nor the emotion-driven, heart-wrenching romance lovers. It delivers 70% in each category, sort of like a ""fusion"" restaurant dish that is neither there nor here. Again, if expectations were not high going in to see this $110 million Sony Pictures film, it would have been a perfectly cute, nicely executed, charming surprise on late night cable. However, one must admit the storyline/script was weak for such an ambitious film, not giving enough to actors to work with, especially Jennifer Lawrence, whose talents were wasted on this script. Chris Pratt... I have never seen him give a convincing performance, this one included. P.S. Was anyone else reminded of the bar and bartender in ""The Shining"" with the bar in this movie??"
" Great movie!
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,10,"Very amusing and wonderfully created science fiction movie.Great special effects.The ship was made amazing,with nice attention to details.Also the space.Good cast that made a good job with their characters.Also great performance by Laurence Fishbourne and the guy who played the android bartender(sorry, cant remember his name now but great actor nevertheless).Simply fun and entertaining.Something for everybody's taste.It is not such a kind of science fiction like was Arrival,witch was also great,but good in a different way.Wish for more great science fiction movies in future. Fun two hours spend. Good yob. All in all.A pleasant surprise."
" Critics are just critics, the movie is entertaining!
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,7,"I don't write a lot of movie reviews, but the Metascore of 41 - come on! I will be honest in my review and will state all pros and cons that I noticed and I will try to minimize spoilers. Science: the movie is not the best from scientific point of view. It contains a lot of scientific goofs, a couple of which are easily noticeable. So if you are good at astronomy (like me) you might feel annoyed at some points. However, you can just ignore these. Ethics: a lot of critics wrote about the ethics of the movie (spoiler ahead), because Jim woke Aurora from sleep. They said that was an unethical choice. Well, critics, go and live alone for a year yourselves. And then, almost no one seems to give a damn about Game of Thrones' ethics. So, please, shut up about ethics. Romance: Not a superb one, but better than average.Overall I was thinking to rate the film with 6 or 7 stars, and decided that 7 fits it better. I would never watch it twice, but for one time only, it is great!"
" Lazy and underwhelming
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,6,"I would say this is a bad movie. Its beautifully made and the cast is strong. But the plot is entirely predictable after the first 15 minutes. The script is set up in a way that entirely telegraphs what is going to happen once the initial plot device is set up. That may be OK if you don't value plot twists and surprises, but if you do you will not get any here. But that still leaves the question that if the entire audience can see it coming that Michael Sheen's android is the one who will tell Aurora how she was awoken why can't Jim? After all, as is demonstrated later, all he would have to do is remove one circuit board from the the android to shut it up forever. Duh!Also the movie is full of holes and implausibilities that obstruct any form of suspension of disbelief. For example, it is utterly implausible that the ship would not have emergency protocols to awaken crew in the event of trouble. How on earth does the ship's sophisticated computer systems not know that passengers have awoken too early? And why do the passengers not awaken say a medic once they do have access to all areas.Its unfortunately its the typical lazy screen writing we have come to expect from Hollywood. But having said that, some of the zero gravity scenes are stunning."
" why not making a movie which make sense!!!
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,5,"5000 people 90 years to go; Once Chris P discovers that the ship has the ability to hibernate people than the stupid sacrifice is not needed anymore! it just needs everyone in the ship to stay awake for 2 months ONLY, ""one by one"" to survive remaining 90 years! You wake up the next passenger, ask him to stay awake for 2 months and explain the situation of a failure in the ship, ask him to hibernate you to your remaining sleep. He should do the same for the next passenger on the list 2 months later! EASY!!!!Everybody would have completed the journey by getting old for 2 months ONLY!!!! not 2 people wastes their life in a stupid ship for remaining 90 years because they love each other so much!Don't you get mad when there is such an easy solution to the problem and a genius team, Colombia Pictures spent millions, cannot think about it while producing this movie??!!!!"
" Stirs the imagination- what would you do?
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,10,"With a plausible set-up in a future that can hibernate humans for interstellar travel in a commercial vessel, this movie explores this world and more. It is highly original and funny, but also thrilling and controversial. I found myself imagining being on this spacecraft and the thrill it would be. Then I imagine myself in the situation of Chris Pratt after a time. It would be truly dreadful. It makes sense that ""a drowning man will drag others down with them"" - this key point seems to have been missed by some reviewers, and is fundamental to the plot. The relationship that forms between the two main characters is realistic and touching. The ending was perfect. Their situation made me question the choices that they made and the possible alternatives, and to discuss them with family, but all alternatives are inferior to the choices both of these two made. In the end, I too would make the same choice, and what a ride it would be! Just loved this movie!"
" Robinson Crusoe in Space
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,7,"While traveling to the colony Homestead II with 5000 colonists and 258 crewmembers in hibernation pods in a 120-year voyage, the spaceship Avatar is hit by a huge asteroid that causes malfunctioning in one sector. The immediate consequence is the opening of the pod of the engineer Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) 90 years before the destination. Jim unsuccessfully seeks a means to repair his pod and to communicate with Earth and soon he realizes that he is alone with the company of the android bartender Arthur (Michel Sheen). Along one year of isolation, Jim almost goes crazy and he feels attracted by the gorgeous passenger Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence) and he learns that she is a writer. Jim lives moral dilemma but one day he awakes Aurora and claims that her pod had malfunctioning like his. Aurora is devastated but after period she decides to write a book about her experience in Avatar. Jim and Aurora become lovers and while celebrating her anniversary, Jim tells Arthur that they have no secrets and Arthur understands that he may comment to Aurora that Jim had awakened her. Aurora becomes angry with Jim even physically attacking him. But when the pod of the Chief Deck Officer Gus Mancuso (Laurence Fishburne) has malfunctioning and awakes him, they learn that Avatar has failures in several systems and may blow-up. But Gus is terminal since the malfunctioning of his pod caused more than 600 problems in his boy. What will happen to the Avatar? ""Passengers"" is an attractive romance with the storyline of Robinson Crusoe in a spaceship. The special effects are top-notch and the sets are magnificent. The lead couple is charming, but Michael Sheen steals the show in the role of a bartender android. Andy Garcia only gives name to the credits with a cameo of a few seconds. The story with a commercial happy ending is absolutely predictable and it is hard to see Jim exposed to a nuclear reactor fire without any consequence. But the plot is entertaining and better and better than the overrated and boring ""Arrival"". My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Passageiros"" (""Passengers"")"
" Attention-catching and unique, but a bit droll
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,7,"Passengers has a good story line, acceptable acting, decent direction, and absolutely incredible sets and CGI. The movie is both slow paced and fast paced in just the right amounts, with the pace fitting the context of the script. It is entertaining, exciting and draws the viewer quickly into the plot and holds us there.The downside is an anticlimactic plot element. Neither the director nor the actors make the resolution of the film believable. At the end I found myself wondering about different ways they could have ended it better... and that's never good.Mind you, how they ended it was okay, just kind of... lacking that certain something that makes a person say ""Wow, that was a great film."" It's an interesting film. But if not for the spectacular sets there isn't much here that would set it apart from class-B scifi with good CGI.The sets are incredible. THIS is a generation ship in all its glory. The only thing that could have made them better would have been 3 or 4 more sets just as grandiose. The set design was unique, creative, and fine. The bar-- a central area to both ship and plot-- is a great bar, with a very pleasant android (no spoiler there... shown in the commercials) that is both well-acted and essential to the plot.Neither actor really brought out the emotion one would expect in the situations presented. Whether this was poor casting or poor directing is difficult to tell, but imo neither part is pulled off well. They came across like actors playing a part; this is one film in which unknowns might have been better cast as the leads. The characters are almost static, expected and predictable all the way through. In truth, there's only one scene in the film that one might consider unexpected, and it's at the very end. The rest of it, although brilliantly presented and filmed, is somewhat cliché.One of the biggest problems of the film was a plot device. When one of the characters does something morally and ethically questionable, the film just never seems to succeed in overcoming that. Nothing that happens thereafter succeeds in overcoming that major hurdle. It tries, and provides a particularly good ""illustration"" in attempt to resolve the matter (no spoilers!)... but in whole it just falls flat by creating a non-sympathetic character.Overall this show is well worth seeing. There are good moments in it. It's just that at the end one feels that the spaceship was the real star of the film."
" Thought the movie was Awesome!
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,10,"I thought the movie was overall very good! There were a few scientific inconsistencies, but the story-line was great. After done watching, it got me thinking for a while- imagining what it would be like to be there. This was the best movie I've seen in a while. I really hope there are future movies similar to this. It was very exciting and I never got bored of watching during the movie. It would be great if they came out with a sort of squeal later. 11/10, I seriously think this was a very good movie, especially if you like sci-fi movies in general. The second half of the movie was the better part, yet, the whole movie was astonishing."
" Listen to the Critics!
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,4,"Spaceship breaks down... gets fixed... spaceship keeps going.Other than that, dude gets woken up by accident, has creepy attachment to girl in suspended animation, wakes her up too so they can be stuck together forever for 90 years. Him full well knowing she will eventually sleep with him.Meanwhile... aside from this and an ending that is a ridiculous climax with a ridiculous solution... nothing happens. There are a lot of cool individual scenes but the movie is not the sum of its parts.The acting is OK, but the chemistry is not. You'll want to go into suspended animation after watching this too it is so boring."
" Nothing new here, would have been relevant 15 years ago
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,6,"Right off the bat I think I can safely say that Passengers is not a groundbreaking sci fi movie. There are no new horizons being explored in this venture, rather a lot of things have been borrowed from various movies based in space and jumbled up to create Passengers. Lonely passenger stranded on space station - check, falling in love - check, betrayed by the one you love - check, disaster in space - check, lead pair saves the day - check, rogue AI - check. It's as if somebody saw a lot of sci fi movies over the ages and came up with a checklist of things to cover in Passenger. What's going for this movie then? 1. Good performances by our lead pair, esp. Chris Pratt who is getting better with each movie. 2. Visual effects And that's about it. It definitely does not qualify as a blockbuster movie and there is nothing to set it apart. It may work as a love story but not enough time was given for the lead pair to grow on you. the ending is kind off abrupt and I felt that they could have done away with the whole disaster angle and instead concentrated on the relationship issues one might face in isolation. That would have worked. 6 stars from me only for the acting."
" Another movie the critics got wrong
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,10,"Fortunately I didn't listen to the (preposterous) critic reviews, and watched this movie and was totally flabbergasted. I wasn't a Cris Pratt nor a Jennifer Lawrence fan until this movie. I cant depict any flaws in this movie. It has special effects, action, drama, comedy, a love story, the complete package. However, do not expect a Star Wars, Star Trek type of sci-fi. The movie is in line with real facts, such as NASAS endeavour to colonize other planets (due to the earths overpopulation & its inevitable demise etc). I have seen this film twice in the cinemas & about 10 times online. Will definitely be purchasing in 4K as soon as its released. The acting was exceptional. You are morally challenged by some actions that take place. I believe its every mediocre mans or commoners dream, to be in an environment that will grant you access to a beautiful women, who would otherwise be unattainable. I just pray they make a sequel to this fantastic movie. It has been a while since watching such an enjoyable movie. Best movie of the year."
" 1/3 of a great Movie
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,7,"First of all, the settings, visual effects and design are great. After watching the trailer i was afraid that the movie would look and feel artificial. But luckily, this isn't the case. You actually felt like being in this situation on a gorgeous spaceship with actual purpose and function.This is also were the story has it's strength. The movie had a classical three-part structure and i really enjoyed the feel and handling of the first part. The more romantic second and action-pact third part are more falling apart. The story follows a more convenient path from there on.Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence are very good in their charisma and acting. I believed their characters decisions and motivations for the most part of the movie. The supporting cast is also quite good.After all Norwegian director Morten Tyldum delivers a good, entertaining and terrific looking fun-ride."
" Date Rape Saga that Belongs in Guiness Book of Records
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,7,"Wow, talk about switching gears! The first 30 mins of this film is WONDERFUL. Considering the recent competition (Matt Damon, Sandra Bullock) the first 30 minutes of Passengers is right in there, a contender, fighting for the hearts and minds of the viewer.The accidental awakening, the obvious commerciality of the ship, the fact that Pratt's character cannot access anything more than coffee on the breakfast computer, the constant reassurances from the 'bots that ""all is well"" (reminds you of what happens when you call your cable company) ... all the seemed the perfect setup for a really great LOST IN SPACE film.But. Alas, such was not to be. Instead the film takes a sharp right turn into rom-com town, and gives us perhaps the most elaborate date rape saga in the history of the human race.Pity.Closing comments: Pratt sells his character. Lawrence does not. There is no chemistry, even in the scenes where there is SUPPOSED to be chemistry.Would have liked to see the same film with Anna Farris (Pratt's real life wife) playing the female lead. Would have been more interesting."
" falls flat in logic
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,1,Falls flat on logic. The movie has more plot holes compered to the reactor. The way they discredit the possibility of having hibernation facility for re-hibernation on this ship is absurdly fast and just too easy... why are there not people waking up checking everything and going back to hibernation that seems like common sense. The fact that even if all this was fine with the plot why they didn't just use the one re-hibernation method they found for lets say 5 years each so they can live long enough to reach the new planet and get going there ? Why?!?!? Andy Garcia was amazing in this film great way to use talent. My favorite part is when ...
" Unexpectedly brilliant
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,8,"If you ask the question ""What is Sci-Fi ?"", you'll get several answers depending on the age and personalities of the people you ask. It is a genre that is continually changing, morphing to the social comment that the influential collective is thinking about at the moment.In the '60s it was all about exploration; short skirts, heavy hairdo's and quick witted, plucky captains. It went through the drugged '70s, the business '80s, the internet connected '90s and the opinionated 2K's to the current ""let's do it better than before"", with retries (called ""re-imaginings"", LOL) in film of everything Sci-Fi.I was expecting the same formulaic ""let's tell an old story again"" attitude in this film but found something else completely. It is an assembly of the best parts of all the eras, not only in Sci-Fi but also in other genres; a seamless mash-up of drama, suspense, romance and , of course, Sci-Fi, created by a mastermind and executed by a talented team.I would recommend this film as it proved to me that something new can be made from parts of something old - and it can be brilliant."
" Don't listen to the critics.
",2017-02-03 00:00:00,8,"Passengers, starring Chris Pratt, Jennifer Lawrence and Micheal Sheen, is a movie about two people, Jim and Aurora, getting woken up 90 years early when in cryogenic sleep traveling to a new earth on spaceship called the Starship Avalon, and they have to find a way to live the rest of their lives in the ship.What I think the critics of the movie don't' like about it is that it is very slow in the first hour and the flat love story between Aurora and Jim. I can look past that though, and see great performances from the two leads, great visual effects, and great drama at the end of the movie.All in all, if you are reading this while passengers is still in cinemas, please go watch it because it is a good movie despite what the critics say."
" Worthwhile but short of expectations
",2017-02-03 00:00:00,7,"WHAT'S PASSENGERS ABOUT? A man and woman wake up from cryo-sleep on a futuristic space flight decades before the other passengers.IS IT ANY GOOD? (GRADE: C+) On paper, talented and attractive Hollywood stars Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt should make for an ideal on screen romance. Indeed, one reason Passengers works as well as it does it their ability to elevate the material. Their chemistry suffers, however, from a under-cooked screenplay that hinges on deus ex- machina plot conveniences, laughable dialogue, and questionable ethics that give the romance a bit of a creepy vibe. Still, the visuals are phenomenal, the impressive sets alone are worth the price of a matinée, the stars are solid (Michael Sheen nearly steals the show as an android bartender), and the ending is emotionally-satisfying. Passengers is worth seeing if you're a fan of sci-fi, romance, or the actors, but it fails to meet its potential.IS IT OKAY FOR YOUR KIDS? Passengers is rated PG-13. It features one f-word and several moderate profanities. We see a man's naked rear end as he walks around a spaceship. A woman wears a revealing swimsuit. There's two sex scenes (one right after the other), one of which features obscured nudity. There are intense moments of peril.ANY WORTHWHILE MESSAGES? Lies and dishonesty always come to light and damage trust in relationships. Accountability and vulnerability draw people close. You may not control your circumstances, but you can control your response and attitude."
" A solid film that was sadly trampled by early critic reviews
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,6,"I believe that this was a good film, the performances were solid and the visuals were quite good too. The best performance probably from Michael Sheen as the android, Arthur. Despite all the comments on how this film does not utilize the idea of isolation and confinement well and that the romance in this film overtakes the more important theme of this film I enjoyed it, here's why. I thought that Passengers discusses a very important and age long question, the question of sacrificing your own well being or to sacrifice another's in order to fulfill your own. It's a very deep and thought provoking question that I believe the film possess very well. I thought that the themes of isolation and the romance between the characters were not overpowering each other and were well balanced by splitting it by acts. The film was suspenseful as our characters unravel the causes to the mysterious malfunctioning of the film and the empty atmosphere created by the film was really well realised as well. I felt that the characters were sympathetic and they made very rational and reasonable decisions unlike what early reviews have described as, ""creepy"". Of Course it lacked in some parts in terms of its rationality but this is always a thing that bugs some and doesn't at all bother others. I can be either of those people at times and I did find that certain points in this film were irrational in my opinion however are points that can be gotten over with. So I recognise that there are flaws in this film but it is a solid entry and an enjoyable watch that has been trampled over by the critics."
" A visually impressive Sci-Fi romance
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,7,"It's not hard to see what Passengers could've been, but this big budgeted and much hyped Sci-Fi romance starring two of the worlds most well-liked Hollywood stars is one of the more curiously forgotten-about spectacles of the increasingly busy end of year releases. Really, though, this largely critically panned feature is not half as bad as many have called it out to be.Very far from the Titanic in space it was looking to become, Passengers is still a polished and visually arresting tale of love and survival on human transport ship Starship Avalon that allows everyone's new favorite good guy Chris Pratt a chance to show his solid leading man credentials and The Imitation Game director Morten Tyldum a chance to go wild with the possibilities of imagining what life would be like aboard a ship designed and catered to delivering such valuable cargo on a 100 plus year voyage.From themed restaurants, spacesuit adventures, swimming pools right through to a manned bar, Passengers design of Avalon is a sight to behold and provides a point of difference to our average movie space ship that is often grum and lifeless while the film's often lighter tone is highlighted by Pratt's turn as the unfortunately early awoken Jim Preston.To say that Passengers doesn't go to dark places however would be a disservice to a film that perhaps goes too dark for some people's tastes, but it feels as though Tyldum and his team can't do these element's full justice and some of the films 'big questions' don't get fully formed answers, while the films 4th act is a particular letdown, especially after the movie's impressively captivating opening stanza.The other rather glaring problem that stops Passengers from becoming the sum of it's parts is the introduction of Jennifer Lawrence's Aurora Lane who plays a true support turn to Pratt's Jim, but while the two likable actors clearly get on like a house on fire (as evidenced by the press tour) the budding romance of Jim and Aurora as they come to grips with their situation on Avalon never really comes out trumps.Had the duos off-screen rapport been better utilized between the pair it's likely that much more of Passengers more corny dialogue and underdeveloped situations could've come off a little smoother, while the sometimes uneasy relationship the film develops between it's lighter and darker moment's would've felt much more fluent.Heading into Passengers with an open mind and willing attitude will allow the viewer to experience a fun deep space adventure filled with enough romance to keep the Hallmark crowd well and truly happy and Sci-Fi fans intrigued by the imagination on show. By no means a Sci-Fi classic, Passengers is still a journey worth jumping on board for.3 and a half pesky security doors out of 5"
" Waw
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,10,"OK, I'll try to do not spoil the movie in this critic, but, just WAW. I think it's now by far my favorite movie. I think I almost liked everything inside... It's my opinion, but... When the movie was over, at the cinema, I had this feeling that I really rarely have, of sadness because it's over and I had a so good moment, and I was so much inside... The acting is really good, the special effects are also amazing and all the environment is... Just waw... I just fall in love with the technology in this movie... I saw ""Gravity"" just before, so I was a little septic about another movie about space and troubles, but this has nothing to do with space! In fact, yes, you are in space all the movie long, but not the dangerous space that kills you. You are in the beautiful space that just amaze you and make you cry because you are not born in the good century..."
" Rushed, Lack of Substance
",2017-01-30 00:00:00,5,"Passengers is okay - but be aware that it is at least 50% a kind of romance/drama and not sci-fi. Also I got the impression that everything is kinda rushed or just superficially touched (he gets lost in space, Lawrence jumps into suit and within 2 mins he is back on board, than he's dead, and 1 min later he's alive again etc. pp.) and of course you get a lot of Hollywood pathos etc.First of all my main problem is the story itself - common guys, our hero is an engineer who can repair the main reactor (alone!) but after waking up he never really wonders or ask himself why his pod failed, why all the malfunctions are occurring and progressing!? Well, with that amount of time at hand and not much to do (besides dancing and basketball) he showed a tremendous lack of interest into technical stuff - at least for an engineer... Also why not wake - maybe a nice female ;) - a member of the crew to open the door to the ship- bridge!? And did he really tried to open that pressure door with a hammer and a small welding machine!? And an engineer who makes a call for help but he doesn't know that his message will take years to reach earth and years to get the answer back!? Or why there is no main-control- system to talk to!? And on this ship all systems are on although there is some serious and progressing issue with the main generator-system!? Questions raised, but no answers - with this kind of design imo this space-travel is a suicid-mission...So what's left to say!? ofc Lawrence, Pratt, Sheen (Sheens performance as droid-bartender is imo the highlight of the movie and maybe a reference to Kubrick's Shining!?) and Fishburne can play, and the cgi etc. is pro, and the scenario of Passengers had potential but failed to deliver to be great - movies like Sunshine or the classic Silent Running beat Passengers easy. But for a date it may be just the right choice."
" not bad, but....
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,7,"It isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination. The idea is original enough. The effects are spectacular. The plot line is solid enough.But it does lack a few things which would make it brilliant.Firstly the cast are beautiful, but they are a little unconvincing in their performances. A little too light and ""Hollywood"" for my taste. The typical holiday block buster approach, with too many attempts at humour in what would actually be a terrifying situation.A good idea spoiled by the Hollywood blockbuster method to making movies. A better cast and perhaps a slightly darker approach, would have made for a much more memorable film."
" Finally a sci-fi movie I can recommend
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,9,"A thoughtful and compelling film that stays just this side of unbelievable. Great visuals, strong acting and a surprising anti- corporate sense of humor. No icky aliens or extended space warfare scenes, this is pure drama and romance that also wrestles with several moral dilemmas. Special mention goes to Michael Sheen who plays the compassionate if robotic bartender and inadvertently triggers the unraveling of the main character's secret. Most of the movies I've seen on the big screen over the last ten years have been disappointments that made me feel I'd wasted the ticket price. Not this one, I've now seen it twice and might go back again."
" Enjoyable yet not too special.
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,6,Passengers is a sci-fi film about two passengers who wake up from hibernation 90 years early. The film includes large fractions of romance and action due to malfunctions aboard the ship. Chris Pratt who plays an engineer from his previous life on Earth begins the film with a great feeling of fearing being stranded that was very shocking through his tremendous acting on how he starts to lose grip of humanity. It gave a slight similarity to the film Castaway starring Tom Hanks which i thought was great. Jennifer Lawrence later appears as a higher class passenger and creates great acting chemistry with Chris Pratt. I would certainly like to see these two in another film. This film did have a fair share negativity to it such as lacking originality as it felt like a big mash up of films we've seen in the past. Some scenes seemed a little unrealistic particularly to do with the romance side yet this didn't effect the main plot in the film. Michael Sheen who played a robotic bartender was my favorite addition to this movie as he lifted humor into scenes that were becoming very dark and depressing and generally seemed to fill gaps in this movie. To conclude this i would say passengers was an enjoyable film to watch once but not again and didn't show anything ridiculously amazing.
" Romancing the vastness of space
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,7,"I dislike reviews that summarize the plot or discuss the plot unless the latter is done to support an opinion. So, I will not do this in this review. Here are my thoughts and impressions.This film that was a very pleasant surprise. I had no expectations and enjoyed seeing the two actors (Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence) in a genre film and role I hadn't seen them in before. My only previous experience of seeing these two on the screen previously were 5 year engagement (which I LOVE) and hunger games (meh, its okay).These two are great in this film. There is a great chemistry and given the romantic turn this film takes, it works. The plot is great too--I like how the film explores the nature of space travel and the realistic challenges that it creates in the life of mere mortal humans. I also enjoyed seeing these characters grapple with some very serious predicaments that forced some decisions that could be viewed as selfish and suddenly turns to be completely unselfish.This film is not a run of the mill film--it has some great ideas and perhaps even themes (if you give it some thought) that are explored exceptionally well."
" ""Time"" — Time is the only thing in life that man is free to dispose of his discretion
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,9,"I don't know why, but watching the film ""Passengers"" I have raised in my soul nostalgic memories about the album, ""Еlectric Light Orchestra"" (""ELO"") ""Time"" (1981), the theme songs on which the fate of a man caught with the help of a time machine in the year 2095 and are not able to come back. I especially remember the song ""21st Century Man"", the meaning of which is that despite all the great technical achievements of mankind of the 21st century, they themselves do not make people happier, and even on the contrary, make more aware of their loneliness:""Fly across the city, rise upon the land,You can do most anything,Now you are twenty first century man.You should be so happy, you should be so glad.So why are you so lonely, you twenty first century man?""In my opinion, the main theme in ""Passengers"" is the theme of human loneliness. How it is shown in the film, deserves a separate description, but to avoid spoilers let me just say that at all times the universal, and yet the only cure for this epidemic of our age is the Love, and it is capitalized. This is light feeling that had test heroes Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence, it helped them better understand themselves and defined the whole meaning of their lives. No matter in what conditions was their fateful meeting, the important thing is what impact it has had on the future of Aurora lane and Jim Preston, through some painful doubts, fears and uneasiness were the heroes on the way to the realization of a common destiny that bound them aboard the space ship ""Avalon"". I believe it is the desire to live ""here and now"" in the earthly present, not ""someday"" in the future transcendental determined the final mutual decision of the lovers.As for the actors, I can say that they excellently managed with their images. Chris Pratt was able to show courageous and at the same time, not alien to romance man, which by the fate, or maybe, by the chance, took, perhaps, the most difficult decision of his life. I respect and love Jennifer Lawrence as an actress, I don't think that her roles as a strong and independent heroines somehow spoil her, on the contrary, it perfectly reflects her character and willpower. Here, as in ""The Hunger Games"", the actress showed herself from the best side, performing the role of a young writer feeling a certain emptiness in life and seeking to fill the dream of a new life. But, as often happened in life, what we seek is sometimes much closer than we think, it is enough to look inside yourself and look around, and we understood what is our main earthly value, not illusory, though very attractive and alluring.A film for romantics and those who love and appreciate a movie that raises questions about major life issues such as loneliness, finding yourself and your place in this world, and, of course, about love as a unique way of coping with reality and at the same time to escape from it.""When you feel your ship is sinking,When you feel your heart is breaking, Hold on tight to your dream""! (""ELO"",""Hold On Tight To Your Dream"")"
" More of a romance than a sci-fi and not a good one at that
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,6,"I was really disappointed at this. Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt are some of my favorite actors, sci-fi is one of my favorite genres. So this had all the premises to be a movie I'd really enjoy.However I caught myself checking the watch a lot during the entire movie, the plot itself was not much of a plot, and even though their relation started off interesting and believable, they lost me in the second half of the movie on both those points.The movie does look pretty great effect wise and the acting is OK, but that's about all I can give it.All in all a meh movie that could have been a lot better."

" Boring movie in short
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,1,"I personally did not like the movie for several reason: 1. The plot is ordinary, no story in particular 2. very few cast characters in the movie makes it dull and least entertaining space movie so far. Entire movie just focused on three main characters: First Half, Chris and Sheen only and then later half, Jennifer introduced. 3. There is very little suspense in the end but there are way better space movies out there such as Gravity, Mars, Interstellar and recently, Hidden Figures 4. First half doesn't entertain the audience, seems more like a video game or anime 5. Very few laughter moments, could be more dramatic and full of thrills. For me, it was a waste of time and money"
" Don't see it
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,5,"When I saw the trailer of PASSENGERS I thought that this movie would have great action and I should definitely see it with my two cousins. We went to the cinema and paid 25 euros each one of us (VIP class) to have some nice fun, instead of watching ""Rogue one"" for second time.The script was for 15 years old boys. The plot was very slow. The actors were below average. The only scene that was interesting was the space walk when the reactor had a serious problem (how particular).Sorry folks but I got B O R E D. But yeah I saw a lot of Jennifer's pale skin, her legs, her lips, her eyes. Still no serious action. Only a couple of grammars of mystery, a phlegmatic but uninteresting robot bartender and less than 10 minutes of Laurence Fishburne in his worst (and shortest) role of his career. He didn't even convinced me that he was coughing!Don't see it. Don't even rent it."
" Incredibly enjoyable and moving

It was easy to put yourself in the story, wondering what decisions you'd make if you were there. The situations were developed to allow you to really feel it. The chemistry of Pratt and Lawrence was a catalyst for tangible tones of romance, conflict, and survival in this space of nothingness. The movie really portrayed the immenseness of the setting, and made you wonder what it would be like. You'll walk away loving this, and yet still, again, wondering what you would do.... I'll see it again:)"
" Passengers ShowMeTheMovies Review
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,8,"showme-themovies.blogspot.co.uk/2017/01/review-passengers.htmlWith its' limited cast and seemingly cliché story, Passengers surprisingly succeeds in its' depiction of a moving tale of loneliness, morality and belonging.When I first caught wind of Passengers, I pictured an atypical, unimaginative love story only made slightly more interesting by its' sci-fi setting; Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt the lucky A-listers brought in to up-sell a bland, poorly-scripted movie that's' only discernibly interesting concept has been stretched out over a two-hour substance-less picture. Proof that you should never judge a book by its' cover.Giving the movie a chance to prove me wrong, I found not only a well-written story with underlying themes but excellent casting in the form of Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence. Being the predominant (and almost only) characters, Aurora Lane (Lawrence) and Jim Preston (Pratt) had clear chemistry and an ability to command the attention of the audience in a rather unique way.The film primarily follows Jim Preston, a passenger on the spacecraft 'Avalon', on an intergalactic, 120-year-long journey to a new colony. After waking up in his cryogenic sleep chamber years too early, Jim finds himself alone (all bar (!) an android named Arthur - played fascinatingly by Michael Sheen) and unable to force his way back to sleep, despite multiple attempts and methods. Eventually, on the advice of barman-turned-confidant Arthur, Jim accepts his fate and decides to make use of all the spaceships' facilities for the time he has left - cue video-games, swimming pools and first-class cabins.Despite previously resigning himself to a life devoid of social interaction, Jims' loneliness, desperation and understandable depression slowly begins to drive him mad (a nod to The Shining, anyone?!) and he contemplates suicide by opening an airlock without wearing a spacesuit. The decision to exclude a large cast becomes apparent (and appropriate) here, where one can empathise with Jim's isolation and his longing for new faces.Enter: Aurora Lane. Thought-provoking and filled with moral dilemmas, Aurora and Jim hit it off from the start, and Jim shines to Aurora almost instantly after managing human contact for the first time in over a year. After hearing his story, Aurora is sympathetic towards Jim, and though doomed to perish years before anyone discovers what has happened to them, their dynamics make way for a seemingly good life. Unaware of the dangers that befall them, the circumstances surrounding how both Jim and Aurora woke up then becomes apparent, and the spaceship begins to experience severe failures that have to be solved in order for the passengers and crew aboard (all still asleep) to be saved.What I can absolutely commend about Passengers is how very economical it is with its' hidden meanings aside from its main concepts, and how it flawlessly takes the plot where it needs to go, at a reasonable pace for the viewer. Jennifer Lawrence doesn't appear until the film has properly set the scene - and whilst Pratt carries at least the opening act alone, it doesn't feel like 'The Chris Pratt Show'; it remains entertaining throughout.The acting quality is superb all around; Martin Sheen will likely be overlooked this awards season, but deserves an honourable mention - the presence of Arthur (a representation of the viewer), allows the thoughts, feelings and troubles of the leads to be known - the unemotional voice between character and movie-goer.My one real criticism stems down to the charming-yet-essentially-predictable romance between Aurora and Jim - though the writers' clearly self-aware. I would have preferred a story that focuses on a boy-meets-girl turned friendship than blatant, unnecessary cheese - though the relationship itself entirely integral to the plot. Though easily foreseeable, Passengers did not suffer as a result.Visually, the film is professional, the spaceship itself looked incredible - and the soundtrack had some great choices in it including a well-used Bob Dylan track and a made-for-movie Imagine Dragons tune. Passengers is an overall great film, a sci-fi-come-romance that achieves the best of both worlds; an enjoyable presentation, very compelling to watch. Don't be fooled by the trailers, it isn't that bland, I promise."
" First boring, then unrealistic to absurd
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,5,"The first half is incredibly boring. Nothing happens for half of the movie. I understand that we need to ""feel"" the loneliness. But there are so many good movies that portrayed the Robinson experience without being also boring. And then: completely unrealistic on each level, on each detail (maybe apart from the love story, which is cute and romantic). This is not supposed to be fantasy or adventure. It is supposed to be a pure-blood SF story, whose main character is a mechanical engineer. So I expect that at least most of the technical details should hold a little water, as well as the main story line. But no: every little technical/scientific/engineering detail is completely illogical, and the methods deployed by the main character to solve the situations are absurd. Look: my motorbike has, I believe, around 5 completely different methods to stop the engine in case of emergency (cut the contact, cut the electricity, cut the gas, put it into neutral etc); but a huge stellar ship has: NONE ? A huge stellar ship the size of a village (5270 inhabitants) has only 1 (one) bed in the infirmary ? No sensor detects for 2 years that there is an open hole in the hull of the ship, and loss of pressure in some rooms ?! There is no backup system for anything – instead they repeat ""this system is supposed to be impossible to break, so this cannot happen"" – gosh I don't remember any engineering 101 lesson to ever say this line, they all speak of redundancy, backup, fail-safe and fail-over mechanisms. The individual space costume resists the heat of a reactor that would otherwise break the hull of the whole spaceship ?! There is absolutely no method to alert the large sleeping crew of a huge ship that something went wrong ?! There is no alarm system on a huge space ship ? My car has a better information collecting system from various sensors than that space ship, you actually DON'T need to plug-in floppy-disks around your car to collect data, they kind of get collected automatically and displayed on the screen. And if something stops, you still have the history of what happened before, stored in some central memory chip. Airplanes today have 2 independent black boxes to store everything that happens on board, all information from all sensors, any sound etc; for a space ship they just forget about this. For a space ship I would actually add maybe 3 or 5 different independent backup storage devices, plus maybe 2 or 3 backup computing devices, stored in completely different physical locations, completely independent, each one able to resume operation automatically and instantly if another one fails and maybe other 1 or 2 of them manually. Also: an intelligent passenger decides to solve a complex problem himself alone, instead of waking up like the whole 250 engineering crew of the ship. OK, we all expect a couple of goofs in any standard reasonable SF movie, it is difficult to keep track of all details and even good movies miss things. But when you hear a stupid idea every couple of minutes for the entire half of the movie when something actually happens, then the movie is crap. Good pictures though, loved the graphical effects. And the final completely weird finale to put the cherry on top: what is one young loving beautiful heterosexual couple expected to do alone, their entire lifetime, on a spaceship with 5000 vacant seats available ?... I would have said ""children"". Well, guess what: they decided to just plant a lot of trees."
" Not the thriller i was expecting
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,5,"I have to say I was really disappointed with this one. Maybe I built it up in my head too much but I was expecting an ""on the edge of your seat"" movie, it was far from that.I have given it a 5 out of 10 purely on the basis of the special effects as they were outstanding, and the cast (all 3 of them).But as far as the plot goes it was dull and lifeless. I would only categorise this as romance, very little else in terms of drama or adventure.I would recommend waiting until this one comes on the TV. Shame though, I looked forward to this one :("

I mean, do someone honestly believe Jim and Aurora didn't have any kids, not one? If i have to spend my whole life only with the woman i love, with no living soul around, no friends, you bet i would have a dozens of children, a whole basketball team.

" Threadbare soap opera in space or Boring People Feel Despair
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,1,"I've made poor decisions in my life, but paying 12eur to see this film without researching it a little has got to top them all if measured by the misery I felt watching it. The only reason why I didn't walk out ~40mins in is that I didn't come alone. To avoid ranting, here are the reasons in bullet points:Poor acting. I'm only familiar with Chris Pratt as a comedy actor, and based on Passengers he's better off in his lane. Limited emotivity and emotional range in the context. His last man on earth entertaining himself intersected with blips of despair routine felt like a less effective imitation of Will Smith's in I am Legend. What happened to Jennifer Lawrence since Winter's Bone I will never know. It feels like she may have expended all the nuance and subtlety there and only has routine-issue single emotion faces to display. Laurence Fishburne and Michael Sheen both did their thing. Which is, display complex emotion while asleep. They weren't exactly given much to work with. Which segues me into..Insipid, regurgitated dialogue. Uncharacteristically, I felt like quipping sarcastically at the screen pretty much the whole time. The lines were so typical, lifeless and expected, I felt like I'm in Premonition. *Spoiler* The captain of the ship dies, says something casually humorous in that cliché heartbreaking way before about women appreciating a man in a uniform. The ship is breaking down, and the writer says ""So we're in a ship that's sinking"". Perhaps you were born yesterday and have never seen a film before and found this profound. I cannot fault you. Alas, I. simply. can't. stomach. recycled. garbage.*End spoiler* The regurgitated feeling extends to other criteria as well, from visuals to character types.Frankensteinian, empty plot: It feels like you're watching barest motifs of actual sci-fi films stitched together last minute/unoriginally. Except that even these motifs are just used to prop the ""love story"". Which brings me to..The film revolves around a love story that's, once again, just a stitched up collection of poorly executed clichés. Falling in love with a stranger who you don't know, getting together because there's literally no one else around, The Secret That Ruins Everything Whoops, Female In Anger Won't Listen To Empathy But After Tremendous Selfless Sacrifice She Will Forgive Immediately, and so on endlessly. The problem here is that I'm not merely recognizing tropes, the plot line is really just a sequence of clichés, there's no character substance - let alone development - to flesh anything out. One-dimensional universe we know or care little about. It's a far off future. It feels realistically capitalistic in an unassuming, normative kind of way. People emigrate from earth because it's crowded and some jobs are almost obsolete. But that's irrelevant because love story. Space travel is just a cardboard background for it, that is all.Passengers is a simpletonic, flat attempt to make money because Jennifer Lawrence in space is in love, then sad, then in love again. I couldn't even enjoy it as mindless entertainment because it was a soulkilling drag. Don't waste your money or worse, your precious time on planet earth, yeah?"
" Critics wrong - movie leaves you pondering
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,10,"This is the first 10 I have given a movie. I thought the story was unique and plausible. They did an awesome job on the special effects and also how things react in zero gravity. Chris Pratt and ""especially"" Jennifer Lawrence played excellent roles. The suspense kept you on the edge of your seat and those special moments actually had my eyes watering up. The ending was different and will leave you thinking. This is a movie worth seeing on the ""big screen"" due to all the special effects. I would highly recommend this movie. Andy Garcia played an interesting role that further stimulates ""why"" and ""what ifs"" scenario. I would actually consider seeing this movie twice. Kudo's t the writes and actor and actresses."
" Fun - Fun - Fun
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,9,"This is a Great movie. It try to recreate human relations, or not, into futures Space travels! During the movie they talk that the ship is traveling around half of the light Speed. This should be fun!! But I questioning. The mass of an object also change when travel in Relativistic speed. Like, time and space. Thus, to accelerate or move those objects into the ship - for a reference outside the ship - will request much more energy! But inside the ship, you are not moving in relation to that ship. Thus, no more energy are need to you to move inside the ship! This, looks like a paradox into the Relativistic Theory for me! And also important, could we see the universe around as the same traveling close to light speed?!"
" In Space No One Can Smell You Stink
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,1,"When watching this film by myself and several of my Associates at the WaltersJudsonGroup, we desperately wanted it to end. Such a waste of valuable time lost to view garbage. A Ship headed with thousands of passengers to another planet, and a ""malfunction"" occurs only to open one of the cubicles of one of the passengers - Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) and after awhile, he becomes ""lonely"" and sees another passenger (Aurora Lane) played by Jennifer Lawrence, and he awakens per pod. You can guess the rest - a ""romance in space"" between both of them. A child can come up with a better plot. No thank you. The acting is fine, but the entire story just stinks! 1 Star"
" Life is a journey, enjoy living it
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,10,"The movie is simple, but profound. It's not about romantic notions of youth or sci-fi adventures, though we are treated to very enthralling action sequences, nonetheless. It's about discovering your true self and developing a rewarding connection with another sole that could be truly life saving.Enveloping space sceneries pull you into the cosmic depths. The rotating space ship makes you feel like sailing though the skies rather than feeling trapped in a tin can. Superb acting, when facial expressions are all you need to feel an array of conflicting emotions, makes the movie a delight to watch. Very true to life glitches caused by the electronic brain create a creditable environment. The moral dilemma Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) faces seems so outrageous to many, but don't we all pursue our desires and base our actions on what we want without giving a thought of what others need. We violate the free will of other people easily on a daily basis. The movie offers an interesting concept, how it feels, when you free yourself of all social, corporate and family constraints. What remains of you, if you dissociate yourself from all imposed duties and obligations. Suffering of the people stranded without an illusory purpose and personal value is ineffable, unless they could look into themselves and find courage to trust and really know another human being. Jon Spaihts encourages us to search for answers to the multiple questions. What is real happiness and how to achieve it, if you have no society to feed you egoistic mind and encourage you cravings for the things that boost your self-importance. Does your happiness depend on the place, surroundings, situations and events, or you are still the same person despite the change of scenery. Dou you really always need to be in another place and spend your life waiting for something better? Many viewers find the concept of just being and living your life boring, but it's the only thing that we have."
" Wonderful movie... don't listen to the critics.
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,9,"Passengers, starring Jennifer Lawrence as Aurora Lane and Chris Pratt as James Preston, is a pleasing blend of genres that, while perhaps no threat to the throne of the king of science fiction movies, is yet an entertaining tale that does everything a good story needs to do and even a little bit more. I have not seen a better movie this year and recommend the reader visit the theaters to properly appreciate it on the big screen.James Preston, a lowly and impecunious mechanic, is a passenger on an interstellar journey along with 5,000 other passengers, bound for a colony on a world dozens of light years from Earth. The ship will take 120 years to reach its destination, so everyone has been put into suspended animation from which they will awaken when they are four months out.James is awakened and comes to realize he is the only one. His rising panic is only momentarily relieved when he runs into a bartender, but the bartender turns out to be a robot with less than perfect artificial intelligence. Preston is alone, and when the delights of the luxury liner become old hat, he grows lonely and increasingly desperate.He turns to the bio of a fellow passenger, author Aurora Lane, and gets to know her. He reads her work and listens to her interviews while he sits by her hibernation pod. His fixation grows until temptation wins and he wakes her up from her suspended animation.The moral dilemma which Preston faces is nothing any human has ever had to face before. No younger sibling, terrified by a nightmare and wondering how much big brother would mind being woken up to give comfort, ever faced the millionth part of the moral quandary James Preston finds himself in.The scenario draws us into the story as well: a man on an interstellar luxury liner with all its accommodations to himself and later with a bit of company for which many men might be willing to forsake society to have to themselves. The ultimate sign of a movie having engaged its audience is that audience imagining themselves as part of the story. I was definitely on that ship with Mr. Pratt. Furthermore, the characters are appealing. While the storytellers do not delve into them quite like Shakespeare explored Hamlet, they nevertheless gain our sympathy, mostly due to the charismatic actors who portray them.It more than piques my curiosity, then, to discover that this movie with its captivating scenario, compelling actors and perfectly competent craftsmanship is getting the cold shoulder by movie critics. A movie like Vertigo can understandably fail to connect with an audience who, years later, will come to adore it, but Passengers is filmed in a pretty standard fashion. A brief investigation as to why such a fine movie should be so under- appreciated revealed the stench of feminism.Many of the complaints flying around the Internet characterize Pratt as a sexual predator. Lawrence's Aurora Lane also comes under fire for the way she responds to him.***SPOILERS*** IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE, READING THE NEXT SECTION WILL RUIN IT. RESIST THE TEMPTATION AND SKIP AHEAD TO THE END.The charge that Preston is a sexual predator is a product of the hysterical times in which Passengers was released. When feminists are convinced one in four girls are raped in college, that a single drop of alcohol renders a woman incapable of giving consent – though not the man, because, you know, equality – that saying hello to a woman on the street constitutes harassment, we should not be surprised that James Preston stands accused of sexual predation in a feminist Star Chamber. The stupidity of this should be easy for any non-feminist to see.A sexual predator would not have waited over a year to wake a beautiful young woman from suspended animation, would not have agonized over the decision, and would not have stopped at just one. If I were a conscienceless man on board such a ship and found myself awake, you can bet I would have myself a harem of beautiful women. James Preston awakens only one woman, and that only after becoming suicidal at the prospect of a life of absolute loneliness.The complaints about Aurora Lane are just as silly. When she finds out the truth, she is angry with Preston, and understandably so. She breaks off their relationship and refuses to speak to him. But when things go wrong with the ship and Preston must put himself in danger to save them all, Aurora tells him to come back to her, because she cannot face the ship alone for the rest of her life.To understand is to forgive, and in that moment Aurora understands what Preston did and forgives him. It would take the cold heart of a feminist not to. Perhaps a feminist will be disappointed at the reaction the heroine has, but a regular person will see the shades of gray which zealots can never seem to recognize.***END OF SPOILERS***The sympathetic characters and interesting scenario are bolstered by wonderful sets and special effects that make many frames tiny works of art. Everything works together to imbue that sense of wonder that comes from science fiction at its best, and that magic which comes from our favorite works of film. There is very little to complain about. I went happily along for the ride with characters I plan to visit again, and at the end a song by Imagine Dragons ushers one out the door with a spring in one's step, music which perfectly captures the feel of the bitter sweetness of the film. Even now, as I type these words, the vapors of that movie's enchantment swirl in my head to that same tune. I think I shall not listen to another song until they finally, inevitably fade away."
" Beautiful and Compelling Story - Ignore the Critics
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,10,"Beautiful story of people's longings for beauty, companionship, love, and meaning. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence give compelling performances. An excellent plot and realistic though heart-wrenching decisions make the story incredibly satisfying.The characters' choices drive the movie. Their choices and the consequences are dealt with in a believable and entertaining way, and each decision feels weighty and pervasive. Ignore the negative reviews; the critics are way off on this one. Most of them have a knee jerk reaction to one of the plot's main decisions without weighing the unique circumstances the characters are placed in. At no point in this movie is there any compulsion or coercion, and the fateful decision of the movie, though difficult, is not so from any malicious overtone. Rather the decision hinges more on human frailty than anything else, and it is intended to make us empathize with the characters, feeling the burden of the situation. Even so, the movie makes no attempt to justify this decision, but lets the viewer weigh it and the consequences that follow with the characters. These consequences are also dealt with in a realistic and compelling manner and are resolved in a satisfactory way that respects the choices and wills of the other characters.All in all, a beautiful film with a great story. It touches on transcendental themes that have affected all men and women at all times, and through its poignant moments, brilliant acting, and compelling story, it conveys a story that is both satisfying and inspiring."
" Not what it could of been
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,5,"I can say that with a budget of 110 million dollars this movie could of been so much more. They basically took a weird love story and turned it into a sci-fi movie, and not a good one either. Everything that happened in this movie was predictable, unimaginative, and had holes in it from the start. Not allot of dialog or actors in this movie other than the main characters so I guess the 110 million got spent on CGI? I wanted to try to do this review without giving spoilers but I have to in order to explain my complaints.First the main character is woken up by the ship, because the ship had a glitch or problem, but this state of the art ship was not able, with all it's different computers, to let anyone know there was a problem? It took a dying crew member to figure out there was an issue. Also, if your going to send a space ship into space across the galaxy wouldn't you make sure it's computer chips were protected against energy bursts or whatever crap it was that hit the ship in the beginning? I wonder if the actors read the script and were like, OK, whatever, just pay me.The bar tender was the dumbest robot in any sci-fi movie ever. He had no clue that something was wrong with the ship. He was there when it got hit, but he didn't notice it? and You would think if something happened to the ship that the computer would wake up the crew so they could investigate it, but it conveniently couldn't do that. And with all that technology there was no way to go back into hyper-sleep? How would the crew get back to Earth after dropping off the people. Like I say so many holes in the story in order to keep only the two main characters together throughout this crappy love story. If it wasn't for Jennifer being so hot I probably wouldn't of watched the whole way through(thanks for the bikini shots by the way). No aliens, no killer virus, the robot didn't go crazy and try to kill them (which would of made the move way more interesting), but some how we can grow trees in the spaceship without sun or UV light and fry computer chips like peanut butter cookies!?. Come on Hollywood you can do better than this. If you were gonna make a part two (which you won't) I'm available for story ideas. Hit me up."
" We should all squirm when watching this!!!
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,3,"I should start by saying that I think this film gets a lot of things right. It's very real, it's very beautiful, it's wonderfully acted, it's interesting and engaging. But I have a MASSIVE problem with the central premise, and I am astonished to the point of outrage that other user reviews completely ignore this glaring, morally bankrupt problem.**SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER**I am glad that the movie takes the time to have Jim think very carefully about whether or not to wake Aurora. I am totally on board with the emotional anguish Jim must have felt, with no human contact for over a year. I have sympathy for his situation.BUT!!!!!!What he did in waking Aurora was an abuse of power. He ignored her right to choice (and she had chosen to be in extended hibernation until the ship docked in Homestead). He woke her for entirely selfish (albeit understandable) reasons. When Aurora tells Gus - rightly - that Jim's actions are tantamount to murder, he basically responds, ""get over it, what was the poor guy to do?"" And none of us should be okay with that.This plot device is deeply disturbing because it propagates the view that men's emotions are more important than women's. It's okay for men to abuse their power/authority if there are ""extenuating circumstances""- and if there are, then the victim (woman/other man/child) just needs to shush up already. The victim's trauma is immaterial if the perpetrator was feeling upset/stressed/unhappy/whatever.Look. I understand that Jim was suffering in his loneliness. But what happened to him was an accident; what happened to Aurora was Jim's choice, and he had no right to make that choice.And what makes it worse is that this moral travesty is being sold to us as a love story. What exactly was Aurora going to do, stuck on a ship with only one other human being? Of course she was going to form an emotional connection with Jim. But that's not love, it's called Stockholm Syndrome. And once it developed, the manipulative, victim/abuser dynamic was established. Aurora's choice to stay awake with Jim was not a choice - it was impossible for her to regain agency by that point.I want to like this film and I thought the actors were fabulous - Jennifer Lawrence, especially. But I'm sorry - I just can't get past the implicit message that abuse of power in relationships is ever okay. Keep your kids away from this one."
" Excellent movie!
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,10,"Felt it was necessary to watch since I'm a big sci fi fan. With that being said, I have found this movie to be such well made with strong character lines as well as enough eye enjoyment and exceptionally well played actors.Remanence was rather long as the ending was so well designed to the point that audience will fully use their own imagination as to how the main characters would have carried on after the story end.I have loved this movie that I am sure to keep it when blu ray version comes out and I must say that's very unusual of me.Never been a fan of JLaw but this movie has definitely turned it around.I would recommend it to anyone that are fan of Sci Fi and romance. Such a perfect mixture."
" Very enjoyable
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,10,"First of all i got some bad reviews from friends so i didn't expect much from this title, also i watched it with my wife who doesn't appreciate SF much and i thought it will end up much worse that it actually ended up. She loved the part of his solitude, his transformation when woman is involved in his life, her reactions after, that drama part. I enjoyed it completely, i was astonished by some part where director really made an effort and watched on every small detail. Like message sending and times traveled, in space when she pulled his rope and counter force pulled her opposite to tighten her rope and bounce her, the part where the throws shield doors to get pushed away. Also story is refreshing, it fills the gaps gradually to keep you decently informed. also visuals are astonishing so i think it was an excellent choice for cinema screen. Good work people"
" a wonderful surprise
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,8,"Passengers is a sci-fi romance starring Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence as the two protagonists embarking on a ninety year journey across the universe,this movie is a self contained movie taking place entirely on the ship homestead and gives a unique story telling experience for the director to show the isolation of space travel if you were completely alone on an absolutely massive space ship,although i extremely enjoyed this film and i had a lot of entertainment watching it some things bothered me but ultimately didn't effect my overall enjoyment of the film and one of the best movies I've seen this year.Characters Although there are only four prominent characters in this movie each character gets motivation,a unique personality and great character development that has a pay off and makes the viewer get invested in these great cast of characters,in my opinion a smaller cast allows for more development and gives more time to flesh out the characters as human beings and not just props,this type of self contained story telling is personally my favourite and investing me into the movie,the character personalities are portrayed fantastically by the lead roles of Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence who are great actors,the chemistry between their characters through the movie expands and gives an organic and sweet romance that surprised me it mixed well into a sci-fi movie based around isolation.Plot Seeing the trailers, i knew almost nothing about the plot and was fascinated to see the kind of ideas they would address having an entire space ship as their playground,the topic of isolation was the idea i wanted them to emphasize throughout the film and the utter loneliness you would experience completely isolated from everyone else,although they did show moments of loneliness during the film and were the highlights of the film in my opinion but saying that it doesn't emphasis the characters isolation in full which i would have liked to see and would have immersed my experience in this film by a whole lot having such a great actor that can fully pull this off. another aspect of this film that really confused me was the time span of this film and over how long a time it shows these characters lives on this ship,although it is explained in this film that the movie takes place over a long time span it does not show that time in the movie and really confused me during the viewing of this movie,in my personal opinion this aspect is not a big problem and will not take away from the overall experience.This movie was a very unique experience for me and had a lot of fun watching this film,i would highly recommend this film to regular movie-goers and sci-fi lovers because it offers a very rich and unique twist on space travel and the idea of isolation in this massive ship along with a very organically played out chemistry between the two leads of this movie. 8 out of 10"
" Not bad at all
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,7,"I try to go to a movie on federal holidays, sort of my own way to celebrate. I used to do this for a long time except for the last few years because there really hasn't been anything out there I want to see--even at the $2.25 theater. But a girlfriend & I decided to take a chance on this movie on New Year's Day. Had to pay $12 because the only showing that fitted into our schedules was 3-D, which really irritated me. Never again! Anyway, ""Passengers"" was not a bad movie. I felt really bad for Chris Pratt & prayed Jennifer Lawrence wouldn't find out why she ""woke up"" ahead of schedule. You can't blame her for being furious! This was a good movie, though, and I only wish I had waited until it came to the cheap theater. I don't feel as if I've wasted a bunch of money if I don't like the movie (plus I can wander the hallway and find another movie to watch so my $2.25 isn't totally wasted)."

",2017-01-18 00:00:00,1,"Sadly this was not a well realized film - the plot was so full of holes, I wanted to drop down one to get some sanity. It was such a generic Hollywood/North American story that missed in so many ways and could have been so much more interesting. . . if for some examples:1. The main characters weren't so super fit and nice white North Americans.2. The plot was so leaky - For example - you would think when the main engineer Gus woke up, when finding that Jim Preson had purposely awoken Aurora, he would have ordered an awaking of an expert crew member in the moment of crisis. 3. Jim should have died in the vent - such a better ending to this poor Hollywood ""lets end everything in a lovely happy way"".4. How the hell did Jim Preson a engineer from a world that everything get fixed instantly, was such an expert of super ship mechanics? so so boring.5.

",2017-01-18 00:00:00,1,"This film is bad. Its not bad in a funny way, its just bad.There are elements from past sci-fi films in Passengers DNA that make you hope that the film will pick up in pace, or quality, which sadly never happens.This film is flat, dull, with flat characters that you probably do not care for.I feel bad for larry fishburne who has seen better roles in his career. Giant snoozefest, not recommended, despite all the bought positive reviews on this page.Better luck next time!"
" Fantastic movie
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,10,"I loved this movie. Fantastically shot, great characters, thought provoking story line, and a break away from some of the bland action action action type movies that are out there at present.Part of me was thinking how sexist society is in that they would be hating on Jim for the decision he made, but that if the roles were reversed they'd be wanting him to just man up and help the lonely girl. A quick Google seemed to confirm this.After thinking about it all night I concluded that regardless of my genitalia or sexuality, in reality I would far prefer to be woken up and discover what that entails than to either be in Jims position in the first place, or almost as bad wake up in never never land finding that another human being died alone whilst I was asleep because they were too worried about my feelings to wake me. I feel more human for that."
" Good Movie - I think it could have been slightly better
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,7,"I think it was much better than critics give it credit for. That being said, I can understand, i think, why some didn't like it. We all bring our own biases into films. It was clear to me, from reading some of the professional critical reviews that they would have rated it higher if the events had transpired closer to their personal expectations. I cannot articulate why that is without spoilers, so here goes.**Spoilers**Much of the controversy revolves around Jim's decision to short- circuit Aurora's (Jennifer Lawrence) pod. In the film, Jim has been woken up by a subtle malfunction, caused by a tiny fragment of meteor getting past the ships deflection technology. Jim (Chris Pratt) is awake and finds he was woken up 90 years prior to the arrival at their destination, which means he is trapped on the ship, alone, for the remainder of his life.Jim goes through a series of stages, similar to the film Groundhog Day. He tries to wake the crew, but cannot get through the protective firewall that guards their sleeping compartment. He tries to engineer his pod to put him back to sleep, but that does work, and through research, realizes he can't go back to sleep. So Jim, after meeting a robot bartender, goes through these psychological milestones. Grief, acceptance, etc. After a year, however, he is in complete despair. He considers suicide, but talks himself out of it. Then he sees one of the other passengers in her pod. Aurora (Yes, as in Disney's Aurora). At first Aurora's unconscious form plays the part of Wilson in the film Castaway. Someone for Jim to talk to. She's a novelist, and a writer for a New York magazine back on Earth. Through exposure to her books and her interviews, he starts to feel an attraction to her. For months he convinces himself that he cannot wake her up, rationalizing his feelings away over and over until he can't any longer. So then does, what to many, is the unthinkable. From that point we go through a romance subplot built on a lie. For some critics, they would have rather this had played out as a psychological thriller, wherein Jim is becomes the antagonist. It could have easily have been made this way. Instead the romance goes on for a while until the Robot bartender, due to a mistake by Jim, gives away the secret that Jim woke her up. She is, naturally, enraged. The next act is spent with Jim trying to apologize to her. We can understand why she would be reluctant, and to keep her distance, which she does. But then the ship starts to break down due to a chain reaction that started two years earlier, and what had triggered Jim's pod to malfunction. The malfunctions begin to cascade and wake up a member of the crew, Gus. Gus figures out what Jim did, but there is too much work to do to fix the ship for moral condemnation. Later Aurora looks to commiserate with Gus about what a horrible thing Jim did. Gus agrees, but says it was an understandable human reaction to his situation. Unfortunately Gus wasn't woken up as safely as Jim had been, and his abrupt discharge from hyper-sleep has severally damaged his internal organs. As he begins his death throws he gives his ID badge to Jim and tells the couple to take care of each other, and to fix the ship. Reluctantly Aurora helps Jim find the major problem with the gravity drive, and the movie turns into a Titanic style disaster film. This seemed to be another sore subject with critics, in that movie abruptly shifted gears. In the end Jim offers to sacrifice himself to save the ship, but Aurora begins to realize that finality of that. It isn't articulated, but maybe she suddenly had the inkling that she would be desperately alone. It is one thing to refuse to forgive someone who is right there, and you can always forgive at your leisure, it is another to realize you'll be facing the same desperate decision Jim did. In the end Aurora performs a heroic act to save him.Afterwards Jim finds a way to put Aurora back to sleep using a medical machine, but he would have to activate it from the outside. He offers her the life he stole from her, and in return, she chooses to stay by his side. I thought it was a nice ending, but many others were not satisfied with the happily ever after concept.Overall I think the execution could have been better in some places, and that is a valid criticism. Still I think it is well worth the watch."
" Excellent movie
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,10,"Today I was hoping to find the movie as ""not boring"" only. When I watched it I realized that this movie is one of the most exciting movie that i can see. The content of the movie was awesome, I wish all of the movies would filmed like that. The decisions were made by the characters in film was thoughtfully. You can think ""what would I do if I was him"", but still I don't think that it's going to a easy decision to made. Physcological profile of the characters and the fundamentals of physics was so successful. I replace myself into leading role in the movie, and i didn't just watch it, i lived it.P.S :This is the second movie that i rated 10 stars in IMDb, the other was Inside Out."
" disappointment
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,5,"To me the movie was disappointing. There is no reason to call this movie science fiction. With everything added and the plot clear, it could have been anywhere. Speed 3 for that matter. Writing in some terrorists shouldn't have been any trouble. Perhaps I should say that I am a great fan of SF. To me writers like Asimov, Heinlein and Van Vogt are masters of the trade. When I first read about the story line I thought it would be a movie in their tradition. It is clearly not. I cannot go into details why not, because I could (would?) spoil other people's enjoyable evening. As a love story it is not that bad. And I like a plot in which you don need a lot of characters to tell the story. A must see for the fans of the actors."
" More Than I Expected (I was prepared to hate it)
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,8,"I went to see Passengers expecting to hate it, but was pleasantly surprised with how good it was. The plot was very good and believable, even for a futuristic space film which I usually don't like.The special effects were great...well done.The acting was excellent...very believable.It was easy to sympathize with Chris Pratt's situation in the film. Jennifer Lawrence was solid as usual and Michael Sheen was wonderful.See this film, I promise you will enjoy it....especially the character played by Michael Sheen.Very good film."
" Galaxy-crossed lovers
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,8,"The critics have been a tad underwhelmed by this space opera, but I liked it. It's a love story with a few echoes of 2013's GRAVITY, including seriously stunning CGI, but there is better chemistry between Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt than there was between Sandra Bullock and George Clooney.There's not a lot of plot: Chris and Jennifer wake from hibernation 80 years earlier than they should do on their universe-crossing starship and then have to cope with mechanical problems that threaten the vessel's survival. The pace is a bit slow until things start to go wrong with the nuclear reactor and with Michael Sheen, an android barman whom I found more than a little tiresome. The 'epilogue' is cringe-making but kinda charming.A part of me kept hoping for something out of the ALIEN franchise to bust in and liven things up, but no, this is just a slightly soppy story about a pair of galaxy-crossed lovers and – I'll say it again – I liked it."

Of course, all the actors are great, and even though the direction is not bad, it's really a typical love movie scenario, with the doubt at the beginning, the intense love, the betrayal, and finally the traditional happy ending. That could've been good without all the inconsistencies there are. For example, why didn't they thought to resurrect the captain, just as Aurora did for Jim? And there was enough place for both of them in the end. It would be Titanic all over again if Rose had decided to stay in the water with Jack. Not a bad movie, some ideas are great : leaving a man alone with his thoughts and robots to see his attitude evolve is interesting, the fact that he sacrificed a life instead of staying alone too, but those ideas could've been pushed so much further if they did not decided to focus on their love story. Honorable mention to Arthur, the best character in my opinion."
" Not what I expected from the preview
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,6,"The preview gave me the suggestion this movie would be a science fiction thriller. Instead I got a scientific romance. Bummer!Nevertheless the main premise of the movie was promising, making you wonder ""what would I do in the situation"". But unfortunately the focus was on the romantic development instead of psychology.Special effects were great. A bonus point for introducing the concept of space-vertigo! If you are pedantic you could argue about some plot holes/illogical events in the movie, but hey it's a movie. If everything made sense, it would have been even more boring. Overall the movie is a missed opportunity to be something better.6/10 because you get to watch hot Jennifer Lawrence for 2 hours."
" Titanic in space... for dumb people
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,5,"The premise for PASSENGERS is a smart one, so are the actors. What if you awoke on a 120-year mission on a voyage to a new planet only 30 years in? With no chance to go back to sleep, you are a castaway amongst a sea of people who you will never meet. This turned out to be a movie of 'what-ifs,' with an ending that was so silly and left me moaning out of annoyance. So much could have been explored had the writers used half their brain.This is Morten Tyldum's first directorial work since ""The Imitation Game"" which was a fine movie about code-breakers in WWII. Here is a movie that is more simple. Jim (Chris Pratt) is the unfortunate man who awakes far ahead of his colleagues. At first, he doesn't know what is happening. He comes out of cryo-sleep and follows the normal protocol and settles into his room aboard the spaceship. Were he to have awoke at the proper time, they would have had 4 months of life on board to adjust before heading to their new planet (an earth-like home that provides an escape from those wishing to leave their homes behind). Jim quickly sees the problem, alone on a ship with no one to talk to (besides a chatty robotic bartender who was clearly written to serve as a lazy plot device. Notice how none of the other robotic aids on board look remotely human). He explores the empty space and spends a year in isolation before even making contact with anyone.Here is where the trailer led us astray. I would argue that the trailer set up an entirely different movie, because the occurrences that lead Jim to meet Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence, what a coincidental name for an actual sleeping beauty) are morally gray and make our hero an altogether bad man. I don't want to spoil it, but the film is so silly that it seems like a waste if I don't. Jim falls in love with Aurora after walking by her in cryo- sleep. He reads about her, listens to her recordings. Faced with a future alone, he makes the choice to wake her up and essentially commit murder by denying her the chance to wake up with the others 100 years from now. No matter his actions, this is a corrupt action that (love story or not) turns Jim from lovable to villainous.Of course they fall in love, and as luck would have it another crew member is woken up (Lawrence Fishburne) who helps them realize that there is a fatal error on board that could lead to the destruction of the ship. Like the bartender (played by Michael Sheen mind you), here is another character that was lazily included and dumbs down the plot by turning the story into a clichéd action flick. Yes, Aurora discovers that Jim woke her up, but in the end they still manage to say their ""I love you's"" before heroically saving the 5,000 sleeping passengers on board and living out the rest of their lives in a Stockholm- syndrome lover extravaganza.The movie could have been interesting if it stuck with one character learning to live by himself. It also could have been interesting to see what would happen if Jim and Aurora managed to fall back to sleep and meet again 100 years from now. Would they still fall in love? I liked the idea but didn't care for the actual story. Lawrence and Pratt are fine actors, but even their chemistry can't save this sinking ship. One trailer declared that this was ""Titanic in the stars."" That's quite a statement. Maybe they were referring to the actual wreck and not the plot."
" Worst Titanic Ever, WTF did I just watch??!!
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,1,"This review does contain spoilers -With all those spaceship analogies along the movie, it's impossible not to relate those two romantic stereotypical movies! Except Titanic didn't got the ending so wrong. Passengers begins as a fine movie, and derails real quickly when Chris Pratt discovers how he can wake someone up. Right then and there I couldn't understand why, for the love of what's sacred, wouldn't he wake up someone who could actually help him solve his issue. He had access to everyone files, I'm sure he could figure something out. Oh no, of course the obvious choice is to chose a female, stalk her, and wake her up without she being able to give him consent. What a lame excuse to try and explain it by saying ""a man drowning will try to drag someone down with him. It's not pretty but the man was drowning"". Seriously, Morpheus? Give me a break!When they both got out of the ship to do their space bungee jump, that scenario and that music seemed taken out from a very bad Disney movie.So, Morpheus dies (how convenient him being the third to wake up, a person who knows exactly what to do, right?), they discover what's wrong and go fix it. There's this ridiculous ball of fire they need to take out or the whole spaceship will blow up, and for that, Pratt's character has to go out, hold a door open and die burning while letting the fire get out. Except he doesn't die, cause his suit and a small door he takes as a shield are, apparently, enough to take the heat of a meteorite that almost ended the whole spaceship. And for the romance, right? He gets out of it with only a small hole in his suit and a broken cord. Totally not feasible. Him flying through space, when his cord breaks after fixing the whole thing reminded me of Gravity. The scenes at bar reminded me of The Shining. And that was all that was good with this movie, besides Pratt's and Lawrence's pretty faces.Then comes his resuscitation. I laughed through the whole scene. First she gets out of the spaceship, floats towards him, and of course she can't reach him cause her cord ends, then, of course, she reaches his cord and pulls him. Then we watch a 138 pounds woman, carrying a 250 pounds man to the robotic infirmary and resuscitating him. I can't describe the absurdity of this scene. He's getting oxygen, while he's taking shots on his legs and neck, while he is getting an electric current to the chest wall. Then he wakes up just fine. Not even a brain damage (obviously).You think the absurdity is over, but no. 88 years later and he messed up the specimens that were being carried in the ship, I mean, they were obviously there to be used in the planet, or for people to learn stuff, maybe? Whatever it was, it surely wasn't to make a little forest in the ship? I mean, why? How did the mechanic became a biologist who could create the right environment for that? That was just so awful my eyes hurt, there were even birds flying inside, I could not believe I was actually seeing that.It can be called sci-fi just as much as 10.000 BC can be called historically accurate! Unfortunately that's not how people seem to be taking it. This is gonna be a bad year for movies."
" Above average sci-fi, but still mediocre
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,5,"Is it supposed to be a romance or a sci-fi movie? I'm not into romance so can't comment much on that count, although it doesn't seem like a very compelling example of the genre.If the latter, why on earth would you choose Arcturus - or any star, for that matter, least of all a red giant - for a slingshot manoeuvre? The energy gain from a slingshot comes from orbital angular momentum donated by the celestial body used - not its axial / spin momentum... If the red giant was orbiting, say, a neutron star or some other more massive object, then it might make some sense. But Arcturus has no companion star. And even if it did, you'd be at such great radius (because it's a red giant, with barely more mass than the Sun), a slingshot would take months, for a comparatively tiny gain in momentum.However we're later informed that the ship is at 50% of light speed! At that kind of velocity, only a neutron star or black hole would be able to offer any significant speed boost, and a red giant would pass by in a matter of minutes, with the closest approach lasting mere seconds.Throughout, we're shown a bright blue nebula in the sky, perhaps 30 AU away... but Arcturus is 36 LY away, while the nearest nebula (the Helix) is 700 LY away! Besides which, if the ship has taken 30 years to reach .5 C (it's powered by an ion engine, which is still firing throughout the movie so the ship is still accelerating), then it surely can't be much more than 18 LY out from Sol - it couldn't possibly have reached Arcturus in the 30 years since its departure. Much less any nebula..The skydome palette is totally blue. Blue is actually a nice choice, cinematographically, since it provides a good contrast range and bloom from bright light to black, helping stars to 'pop' while maintaining the impression of depth and distance. However in reality, red is more likely to dominate, since it is subject to less dissipation, and most stars are red dwarfs, but also, whatever their class, they're progressively far, far away and all light sources get more red-shifted the further away they are. Plus the nebula - if that's what it's supposed to be - should be predominantly hydrogen which gives them their characteristic red / orange hue. Not blue. The plane of the Milky Way from space is an awesome and colourful spectacle, and might've found pride of place here, but no, we get meaningless blue splodges...In one cliff-hanger scene, the ship's centrifuge momentarily brakes (negative torque must've been applied since angular momentum is conserved), disabling the artificial gravity and causing the water in a swimming pool to float up into a ball - which is a nice touch, however a swimmer in such a scenario would be squeezed out of the ball by the water's intrinsic tension and higher (than human) density, not sucked helplessly into the center.All of which should by any rights be moot, since the initial cause of all the technical problems is a large asteroid strike. The plasma shield meant to protect the ship from such strikes is a nice idea, but plasma is simply ionised gas, so to destroy even very small and slow asteroids it'd have to be millions of degrees Kelvin, if not orders hotter... yet the ship is travelling at .5 C! A 10 tonne lump of anything at that speed will have an impact energy of 4.3 trillion Joules! The entire ship would've been instantly vaporised! Plasma shield? The whole ship would've been turned into plasma! Despite all this, given Hollywood's usual contemptuous regard for sci-fi, this isn't half as bad as any of the other recent offerings, and not nearly as imbecilic as Denis Villeneuve's Arrival.All in all, good performances, sets, and styling, and worth a cinema ticket, but won't leave any lasting impression."
" Another flick for the zero IQ folks only :(
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,1,"I don't get it, why the soap opera can't stay with the usual setup in castles.Anyone who has the slightest clue about physics, space travel, colonization, engineering, building, etc will shout WHAT? soon after the main title, and by the end repeating ""gimme a ... break already"" every minute.Not that frequently in the first 80% of the film only because it is incredibly slow and the no new thing happens for a while.The visuals are really nice, but it does not make up for stupidity and waste of all those fine resources. Also if you saw the trailer there's nothing more to see -- just imagine anything around those fragments and it will be more entertaining.My suggestion is stay away, do not even rent for home. If you're a fan of the actors like me, even more so."
" Excellent movie with a nice story, but is not perfect
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,9,"I liked this movie so much, beyond its counted fails. The story is totally believable, and characters help to narrate it very well. Some people say there's a lot of holes, come on.. Do you go to cinema to enjoy a movie or to destroy it with your bad bile? * Speed of the ship wasn't ""near to light speed"", it was HALF of light speed (less than 148.000 KM/s), the speed is not a problem to walk outside the ship or float around it, because inertially the characters have exactly the same speed on vacuum of space. * Why there was announcements when passing by close to the star? For the same reason there was announcements when they pass to a room or office, or they could take breakfast or dinner; everything gone active when ""they"" detected humans walking through the ship. * The ship has stores, restaurants, bars, and everything else because the people should awake four months before arrive to destination; and have a crew because they should start the trip and finish it. OK, there was some failings, but all movies have them, because they are stories created by humans. Just enjoy this very good movie.. :)"
" Boring and Contrived
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,5,"The more I think about this movie, the more irritated I get that it wasn't better. Passengers is neither a good sci-fi nor a good romance. There are also way too many plot holes. It's Castaway meets Titanic.Jim is an engineer who has a budget class ticket to the Homestead Colony planet that will take 120 years to reach. The ship holds 5,000 total passengers, plus a crew, all in suspended animation. After a meteor shower takes some of the systems down, his pod wakes him up prematurely--90 years prematurely.As a castaway on the ship with only a robot bartender to talk to, he spends the first year trying to fix his pod and then trying to get to the crew, who are unfortunately behind a fortress he can't breach. And he's drinking...a lot of drinking to the point he almost walks outside the ship without a suit to end it all. Then he sees Aurora in her pod and falls for her. He reads her profile and fights his desire to wake her up, knowing it's an eventual death sentence since they're decades away from their destination. Of course, he succumbs, but tells himself and the bartender that he'll tell her that he's the reason she awoke prematurely...eventually.After the shock of waking up 89 years early, wears off somewhat, Aurora hits it off with Jim. She's a writer who planned to travel to round trip to Homestead and then back to earth, even though she would arrive home some 250 years later. Just as everything seems to be going great, she finds out what Jim did out of loneliness and wants nothing to do with him (understandably).And that's one problem: Jim was so selfish, he was willing to destroy someone else's life just for his need to have a human companion. Another problem is why anyone would want a trip that would take 120 years and your family and friends back on earth will be long gone. Aurora's father has died, but you see a video of a going away party her friends gave her, sad in the knowledge they'd never see her again. You don't get much backstory on Jim, except that he wants to be needed for his skill set instead of living in the throwaway society of Earth. Unlike the audience, Jim seems to be too preoccupied with winning back Aurora to notice that the ship's systems are starting to fail. Suddenly Gus (Laurence Fishburne) appears, who's the ship's engineer and also a victim of a pod malfunction. Almost immediately, however, he is in medical distress because of his early awakening and his sole purpose seems to be to give Jim and Aurora a bracelet that will allow them access to the ship's restricted areas so Jim can fix the problem before the ship explodes. The first part of the movie is extremely monotonous and it doesn't take much to make Jim start to go off the deep end. You've got to wonder why the robot bartender is activated when it's supposed to be 90 more years before the first people wake up. The rest of the movie stretches both physics and imagination as Jim and Aurora try to fix the ship before it blows up."
" Watched in 2D, in hindsight would go for 3D
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,10,"There might be a spoiler or two in this review. This is more of a sci-fi of the OST / TNG genre, than a romance. The science is sparse but solid enough for Hollywood. The ship is traveling at 0.5c powered by nuclear fusion to an earth-like planet 250 or so light years away, spinning on a front to back axis as it goes, to create artificial gravity which gets wonky when using elevators in certain directions (understandable). It is largely autonomous with complex AI but tasteful and believable. I found myself pondering the ship, software and hardware, as much as the emotions and decisions of the characters from beginning to end. The human story is two-scale. One story is that of human migration, corporations, species propagation through the galaxy, etc. It is a story you have to read into yourself, and certain dialogues through the movie will nudge you in that direction. The other human story is that of our vulnerabilities, forgiveness, sacrifice, and unspoken existential questions that again you have to read into. For example, the scene at the end where he says out loud in two sentences the things he would have done for her if they had both met in saner circumstances on the new planet.. could be mistaken as a kitschy Titanic-esque monologue, but their eyes are almost willing these imaginary situations to life, even if in their minds for a brief moment, before he dies. They live an entire life in those few seconds, and the primal human need for relationships to give our very existence any meaning whatsoever, comes forth. These are dialogues and scenes that cannot be truly enjoyed or understood by the less wise, and I was surprised by the quality of story telling, including the apparently unforgivable fallibilities of humans, and a specific decision made by one of the characters. The human story on both scales was truly compelling, and the future believable. I mention OST/ TNG but this was original in its own right."
" Romance movie pretending to be sci-fi
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,5,"The trailers made this out as serious science fiction, but it was basically a glorified ""boy meets girl"" movie in space. Apart from a sleep inducing middle act where nothing happens apart from the two leads courting each other, the suspension of disbelief needed here, is staggering, mainly in the form of seemingly superhuman protagonists. Some spoilers ahead:1. A woman passes out while in a bubble of water, effectively drowning, then miraculously ""wakes up"", while still in the water a few minutes later just because the bubble splashes down into a pool. 2. On multiple occasions people slipping on something and crash landing on their back leaves no damage other than them simply getting up and saying ""ouch"" as if it's a cartoon. 3. Male lead withstands thermonuclear blast at the end without as much as a heat rash, then runs out of oxygen due to a cracked helmet and drifts into space, but instead of freezing and suffocating when the air runs out gets rescued by his girlfriend who simply jumps off the star- ship in his general direction and miraculously catches him.4. Out of 5000 pods, the one of the guy they really need malfunctions, who wakes up, explains how they can save the ship (which he's completely unqualified for given his job), and then being the token black guy, dies pretty much straight away.6. Woman suffers major upper body trauma but carries on as if nothing happens.With a bit of care to some details and without the totally artificial and forced happy ending this could have been really good. As it is, it came across as desperate to not challenge its target audience too much and suffered for it."
" It has its moments, but not enough of them
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,5,"A man wakes up from deep sleep, ninety years too early, on a spacecraft hurtling through deep space, on a mission to colonise another planet. He gets bored, lonely, and decides to wake up a fellow female for companionship. They attempt to figure how to go back to sleep for the next century, while falling in love. Awwww, innit cute? No. No, it's not. It's creepy and manipulative. While an interesting tale of stalking, manipulation, and possessiveness might have followed (maybe) what we get for a considerable portion of the run time is a wholly implausible, dippy little love story, a space opera which we know is meandering toward a contrived happy ending, given its A-list cast, and family friendly PG-rating.Things do get a bit interesting when Lawrence Fishburne's character shows up, but he doesn't add a lot to the story, and has basically an extended cameo appearance, before the predictable tale of redemption and forgiveness kicks in. The screenplay manipulates its audience as much as the characters manipulate each other, and while the film never sinks to being *bad*, it never has anything worth caring about. In a week, I'll probably forget I've even seen this one."
" A Romantic Drama in Space
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,7,"I did honestly enjoy this movie but it did seem to be a bit slow getting going and felt like they crammed all the action into the last 30mins. Some interesting ideas are raised but not truly explored and some of the characters didn't get a lot of build up or background, just kind of came and went. The special effects were top notch, some good exploration of Zero-G. Overall it was a visually stunning movie that sits well within the Sci-Fi genre, a good performance from Jennifer Lawrence, would of been nice to see more of Lawrence Fishburne though. I'm no scientist myself but the science seemed to be pretty solid in most parts of the film. While watching it quickly became apparent that the film was made with a small cast and a big special effects budget."
" Jennifer Lawrence seems out of place in space...
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,5,"The Starship Avalon, in the midst of its 120-year journey from Earth to a colony planet known as Homestead II, suffers a collision in space which prematurely awakens one of its 5,000 passengers (Chris Pratt). With 90 years to go before reaching his destination, Pratt is sure to die of old age on the spaceship, so--with a guilty conscience--he awakens another passenger from hibernation, a pretty female writer. With such an engaging 30-minute opening, detailing Pratt's daily adventures while being the only person awake on the huge ship (and baring his innermost thoughts to a pleasant robotic bartender), one gets the sinking feeling screenwriter Jon Spaihts won't be able to keep up the momentum for long. True enough, for as soon as Jennifer Lawrence is awakened--a sleeping beauty aptly named Aurora--the film slips into formula (not necessarily a science fiction formula, more like a man and woman against the elements formula) that feels staid and familiar (they bicker and make up like the shipwrecked kids from ""The Blue Lagoon""). Lawrence isn't convincing, anyway, as a New Yorker on her way to another planet--her bright, inquisitive personality is so of-the-moment and earthbound that to place her on-board this Starship is an automatic mismatch of actress and milieu. The special effects, art direction and design of ""Passengers"" are impressive but, with such a rote plot, one wishes to jump ship long before Homestead II comes into view. ** from ****"
" 8/10 It can get lonely in space
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,8,"Chris Pratt has come a long way since his first appearance in Parks & Recreation . He has trimmed up and now a bankable star and well worth the reported $12m from an $110 budget , not sure Laurence Fishburn deserved his $20m though . Jennifer Lawrence is the star here , her characterisation was perfect and thoroughly scary at times . When I write my reviews I am very careful not to include any spoilers so rather than elaborate on the above I will concentrate on the story and technical aspects Basically it's a Robinson Crusoe moral love story in space and it plays it well . Well written , good supporting cast especially Martin Sheen as the android barman . The set is spectacular but that is a necessity for the big screen but you could transport this love story to the small stage . It's a likable film with likable characters although scary at times . A love story with moral dilemmas and sacrifices . Best science fiction film of 2017 so far . Enjoy."
" Something new
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,10,"Finally, someone has actually conceived a new story line. No nasty aliens on the ship, no computer gone rogue trying to kill everyone, no villain, and no rip off of Star Trek or Star Wars. This was a new plot (at least to me).Special effects are there, and are quite good, but are downplayed in favor of character development and good story line. They say the best stories are the ones that once you are through with the book, you wonder what happened to the characters the next day. By that measurement, this is a great story.I am a 60 something male, and really enjoyed this movie... even the romantic stuff. Good acting, and a well done movie. Highly recommended."
" Simply stunning...
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,9,"I think the less you know about this movie, the better it is.Take a date, preferably not a cynical or critical one, and you'll have a wonderful viewing experience. Great acting, great visuals, & a great cinematic journey. There's easily enough science-fiction awe & excitement to sate any fan of the genre.And a beautifully woven human relationship/condition conundrum will pull on most viewers heart strings. This is a fantastic film.Very impressive & enjoyable."
" Passengers is like a ""3 in 1 box"" that contains excellent visual image, sexy love story and romance and breathtaking action moments.
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,10,"Firstly, I highly recommend to watch Passengers in a Cinema with huge screen and Dolby Atmos audio, you're gonna be thrilled.As I mentioned in a title it is a pack of 3 - the visual image of that story is the most exciting you've had ever seen, trust me. Every part of the starship Avalon is gorgeously beautiful and based on genuine scientific theories so the movie gives you a feeling like everything you see is really possible in a near future. The effects, voices and the the visualization of the space makes you think like you're in there and gives you a huge dose of excitement all over your body, it just feels electric. The Romance between Jim and Aurora is really kind of interesting because they are like the best friends having fun everywhere, yet they help each other overcome the reality they live in and that creates a real relationship between them. They both suite each other and look very sexy together creating the most handsome couple in the universe.When you're watching this movie, you at least once think about how dangerous it would be to appear in situations portrayed in the movie. The thing I like about the whole story is that you have no idea how it's gonna all end up. There are so many life dangerous scenes which give you a lot of vibration and you really like to watch that kind of action. Overall, I highly recommend watching this movie, it is different, Characters are played in a really awesome way and the entire movie is just a masterpiece among the space movies."
" Rom Com with peril
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,6,"I read a lot of reviews before going to see this. I was pleasantly surprised. However it is not Science Fiction but Space Opera. I was caught out by the play for laughs but it did that well. It also dealt well with the moral issues faced and the acting, directing and photography were all good, but the whole 'willing suspension of disbelief' part was difficult. The treatment of hard SF - the time taken for a message to be received when travelling at relativistic speed - and fantasy - a spinning ship does not require artificial gravity - was haphazard, and the truly unbelievable part was that the whole enterprise was funded by a for profit corporation. No company would wait 250 years for a return on investment, there would be no point, and no way to enforce the contract. A more probable explanation for the system failures would be that it was intended never to make land fall and the whole thing was a scam. With all of the passengers singletons whose entire families would be gone by the time they woke up, no one would care if they never actually did. I am not going to go into how you really would do a colony ship, suffice to say that it was a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours, although If I had been in the chair the final scene would have involved the crew waking up not to find the ship changed, but a couple wrapped in each others arms in stasis in the auto doc pod."
" 6.5 kinda deal but I'm gonna round down
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,6,"Is this a good sci-fi film? Sure, it's good. Is it good enough to pay to watch? Noooooo way in hello operator it is not. Basically this movie is about Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt making kissy faces at each other in space for two hours. The beginning of the film is interesting, seeing Chris Pratt's character deal with space isolation. However the rest of the film seems like a by the numbers type of deal and the ending plays like thrown in chaos just for the point of having a climax. Whatever. Like I said before, it is an okay film. I'll say this about the film, it didn't seem as repetitive as it could have been. If Pratt had a more capable actress to work with, the film could have been a bit better."
" a perfect love story?!? :))))
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,9,"Wakening up on a giant spaceship, entirely alone, save for an android bartender which can only simulate empathy and serve man's favorite liquid: beer, he decide to wake up, knowing is no coming back, Aurora, a women that he never saw before, but is beautiful enough to spend the rest of his life with. Alone, and I really mean alone! just the two of them for the rest of their life. Obviously just a  male screenwriter( Doctor Strange)  and Prometheus' Jon Spaihts – cooked up an idea like this.  The movie itself is definitely worth your time. The acting is one of the best you've seen, but again, Jennifer Lawrence, always gives the best of her in each movie, and the story is lovely and a bit funny. Lots of messages and quite a bit of action too.  What I do think they could do a bit more is answering  a few more questions. I understand you want to let some question marks after the movie, so the movie stay in the peoples head longer, fair enough , but, come on!!! this movie lets a whole story of questions."
" Well done
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,9,"I really enjoyed this movie. At first, I thought it could be boring. Only two actors - three then and four later - sustaining all the plot... made me doubt but actually I really like it. You could say it's kind of an obvious story and you'll be right but that does not mean it isn't good. Good acting and tricks, good story, action, love and emotions... mostly emotions. I think the main topic in this movie is loneliness and how it affects our lives. How can we, like Aurora, be lonely although having lots of friends; how, like James we can feel useless in a world that seems not to need our talent; how we can't run away of our problems and how we can't plan our destiny..."
" Over-hyped but still a decent film
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,7,"This film proved that the two most lovable actors in Hollywood have some amazing chemistry together, if only they were in a film that actually contained a reasonable plot. Passengers follows the lives of Jim (Chris Pratt) and Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence), two passengers on their voyage to a new life on an uninhabited Earth-like planet who are somehow awoken 90 years earlier than their estimated arrival date. This film is essentially a tedious cast-away love story in the worlds largest shopping mall in space, which truthfully, may not have been as great as the Axiom in Pixar's Wall-E. There is a good heap of comedy and wit (from Michael Sheen) that makes the movie a bit more worthwhile, but the film totally fails to live up to its potential by simply casting a shadow over its already dark premise. There was just so much hype from this film and I'm utterly disappointed at what Morten Tyldum did with this film, especially after what he had done with ""The Imitation Game"". Though I will admit most of the special effects in the film were quite amazing, but then again that was to be expected.Ali's Rating: C+"
" Half this and half that. Mixed feelings (minor spoilers)
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,6,"Well, the posters made me think of Gravity and the synopsis from IMDb made it clear it is not of that type. So I went with least expectations. The beginning was awesome and the first 20 minutes aroused my curiosity. It had every element for a science thriller. But that is just it. Questions started to keep building on how gravitational force works on such a big space ship. Adding to that, the interiors look too big and way beyond belief. For ex, a ceiling of 8 feet high on a space ship is totally unbelievable even for a fantasy. Leaving logic apart I was still okay with the beginning and awaited an interesting space adventure. The CGI was brilliant and watching it in 3D is super awesome. Things take a U turn when Jennifer is introduced. The whole plot jumps into romance. Titanic in the Sky, that is what I would love to call the rest of the movie. Bikini shots, steamy bed scenes, partner fights... Everything in space !The whole idea sounds cool, but most did not expect that as a primary plot. The screen play drags and takes another 1 full hour to come back to the mission, which is the focus. Unnecessarily, in a view to introduce a twist and bring back (wake up) audience from the romance portions, the captain arrives. I felt it is not necessary.Very little is known about the professions of passengers. That made me wonder how the hell they know chip repairs, component replacement and assembly logic. The end was so ordinary and with all the dragging, there must be a self sacrificing captain which has to be the protagonist. And another obvious fact of the lead actress getting her love back. Phew.. I got tired. First 30 minutes. Mind blowing Next 1 hour .. For romance lovers last 30 minutes.. pile of ****"
" Why did he do that?
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,5,"In 2014, M.Tyldum impressed us with a masterpiece Imitation Game, he returned this year with ... Passengers (or mortal boredom), wanting to be an indoor movie, Passengers totally misses himself, during half of the film , No major event happens, one waits nicely, but it is only after one and a half hours, that one begins to understand, if you want to know, there is no twist, all Is unveiled at the beginning, the ship has just a technical problem that one hardly understands, there is no need to report the role of Laurence Fishburne which serves no purpose, it dies after ten minutes. Scenes that are meant to be action scenes are incomprehensible, and those that are well done are useless and have no impact on the rest of the film (as the scene or gravity is cut). There is perhaps a positive point of the film, the Arthur server interceded by Michael Sheen, between the references of Shining and his role in the film, it is only him that serves something and triggers events, It is he who reveals to Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence) that she was awakened by Jim (Chris Pratt), there is also a story without interest, that of the book that Aurora is writing, even at the end Does not know if it was finished ... The film ends with the rescue of the ship (whoo) and quotations like ""you die, I die too!"", Absolutely stereotype ... In summary, a big disappointment On the part of Mortem Tyldum which fell in the charm of the studios Hollywood, I hope that this does not foretell bode bad for later, but I wait to see the continuation."
" A spoof, right?
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,3,"A spoof, right? (Three stars for Jen's bodacious bod! Yummy!)This was either a clever movie that pays homage to the sexist rubbish played out in the SciFi movies of the 50s... in which case it was OK, or it was a serious attempt at re-writing Sleeping Beauty in a spaceship... in which case it's horrible!Also - there's too much running around in corridors (thanks, Doctor Who!) and keeping fit, (thanks, Jane Fonda!)If there's no feasible story or likable characters then pile on the computer generated effects, right? They always save the day and put a lid on pretty much all the plot holes and other narrative nastiness. After all; it works for Star Wars and Star Trek! Make it flashy and noisy and they will come! Nothing else matters.Jennifer Lawrence is lovely to look at and that's what kept me going through this celluloid crime. But listening to her gab on about writing a book made me want to slap her.The last twenty minutes are about as detestable as movies can get. I just can't conjure up the bad memories long enough to write about it, they are so deep and painful!My take, when I walked out into the clean air of the theater, was that Hollywood seems to hate SciFi even more than it hates Republicans!"
" Don't miss the first two minutes
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,8,"It's not a spoiler to say that in the first minutes of the film we get a bird's eye view of the ship colliding head on with an asteroid swarm. Don't ask why this incredibly complicated ship couldn't/didn't attempt any evasive maneuvers. In any case the ship's automated systems are only partially successful in dealing with it, the sequence of events ending with one of the passengers being awakened prematurely from his hibernation pod. It's also important to know before the curtain goes up that the passengers are not astronauts, they literally are just passengers on a space-borne cruise ship which is taking 5,000 people on a 120-year journey to colonize a new world. If you can suspend disbelief long enough you will be very entertained."
" Enjoyable but nothing fantastic
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed this film. The acting was great and the special effects were great and felt realistic. Although the majority of this film had only 1-2 actors it kept the pace nicely, in a couple of places it may have been a little slow, but that can be forgiven as the chemistry between the two actors was great. The ending, although good, was nothing too special, parts we had definitely seen before in other films, but the overall ending was satisfying. It did have a couple of surprises added in also which I liked because I thought a lot had been given away in the trailer.Overall I would recommend this film, its a bit like Titanic only in space."
" Fantastic movie!
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,10,"In the sea of action and fantasy, sci-fi and superheros this one was real refreshment. I usually don't like 3D movies because I think, for lot of them, that they would be much better in 2D. Sometimes action scenes are so blurry, they almost don't have any other point except filling time. This one made me think twice about 3D technology. Not only there were no blurry moments, but the picture was beautifully pleasant to watch throughout whole movie. J.L. is one of my favorite young actresses, and C.P. conquered my heart in GotG. No wonder I was excited to see them together in space. Ship design is something really special, really beautiful. Story is not just another love story, or just another space utopia story. Two of them might be the only ones awake on the ship, but you won't be bored for a second."
" Anti-'Gravity' - In Space No One Can Hear You Yawn
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,6,"PASSENGERS (2016) ** Jennifer Lawrence, Chris Pratt, Michael Sheen, Laurence Fishburne, Andy Garcia. Logy romantic sci-fi set in deep space where a ship full of colonists sent from Earth finds two of its denizens suddenly awakened way-too-early in advance (lonely Pratt and unknowing Lawrence) who fall in love and discover that life is truly a challenge in spite of the odds surmounting their cosmic journey. While the production design is handsome and sharply executed the direction by Morten Tyldum is leaden and rather dull as well as the pedestrian and far-too-predictable screenplay by Jon Spaihts. In Space No One Can Hear You Yawn; Think more like 'Anti-'Gravity'."
" Lame, boring and plain disgusting
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,1,"Passengers opens up with Jim (Pratt), who wakes up in an empty spaceship 90 years too early. He wanders around for 30min (which is almost precisely a one year in the story), drinks whisky and finds a hot blonde Aurora (Lawrence) in a cryogenic pod. He builds a juvenile crush on her while watching her sleep every day like a perv. Tormented by loneliness and boredom, he decides to wake her up for his own pleasure, even though it means he will basically doom her to death by old age. What a lowlife.And how boring lady this ""writer"" turn out to be. She has nothing interesting to say and is just a pretty blonde, who for some reason wants to travel 120 years to a new home planet, live there for one (1) year and travel back another 120 years to Earth just to witness some kind of a time jump 200 years into the future! Wow, what a fool. Seriously, why see such trouble, when you can't even be sure what happens after the first 120 years (or just 35 years). Maybe the new home planet is not what it seemed, or maybe Earth is not like it used to be. What then? So naive, but so is the whole movie.Jim and Aurora build a relationship based mostly on lust. They are together alone, so it was mandatory. But all the forced sex and sappy love scenes were too much. I almost left the theater at that point. What a horrible, anti-climatic script writing. It got slightly better towards the end and almost felt like a sci-fi movie at times, but the ending killed it completely. The film could have redeemed itself, when Aurora had to make a choice. I should have guessed it at that point. Instead, like a sucker I still hoped to witness some logic in the characters, but no. Aurora exposes herself to be as depraved human being as Jim when she decides to forgive the ""murderer"" and choose the ""perv"" and continue her life on the ship with ""enter another character flaw here"".The special effects are sparse for a sci-fi movie. Only captivating scenes were the anti-gravity water bubble and passing of Arcturus. But why bypass a star, if not by a coincidence, if they had already gained about 50% light speed. Makes no sense.It amazes me what kind of trite actually gets released today by Hollywood. Lame script writing, idiotic and annoying characters, bad physics in SF, compulsory sex scenes, boring green scene acting, absolutely zero suspense. Ever so happy endings are aimed for the masses, I get it, but it mainly sickens me. It kills the creative vision and suspense, same thing as if every book had to begin with a line ""Once upon a time..."". It gets old and repetitive. I really felt cheated and disgusted while watching this bore fest."
" It's OK
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,10,"The trailer of Passengers gripped me when I was watching Underworld Blood Wars in the cinema. I was immediately intrigued by the idea of the movie.Saw the movie today. Not bad! It did a good job depicting loneliness and fear in the dark endless universe. Star lord, Mystique, Lucian, and Morpheus all played their roles very well. :)It wasn't until I saw the movie that I realised that James Preston and Aurora Lane did not wake up at the same time, that he woke her up to keep him company. Haha, such a selfish act. I thought, ""When she finds out, she's gonna be furious."" Indeed! Later she discovered. The scene of Jennifer Lawrence beating the hell out of Chris Pratt is priceless.PS: I wouldn't trust Homestead company's sleep pods. They are said to be failsafe. Nonsense! Never trust technology completely."
" Bland and boring
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,3,"This movie is so bland and boring and full of lame clichés. There is nothing exciting about this movie. Why did all this have to happen on the space ship? This story has nothing to do with sci fi. It does not work as a Sci Fi movie, nor thriller, nor drama, nor romance.I agree with other people who have slammed the script writer. What was he thinking? The whole story was mad up from the most lame clichés of the Hollywood movies of the last decade, such as Bruce Willis save-the world heroes, and the tear jerking romantic movies. Both leads were as boring as hell, zero chemistry, all the scenes like eating dry Weetabix.Jennifer Lawrence is a likable actress, and I liked her in Hunger Games, especially part one and two. But here? Fault of the lousy director and scriptwriter."
" Terrible
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,2,"Absolutely terrible movie. No story. Bad ending. Do not waste your time. Since I have to write more to submit this review I will say the trailer makes it seem like there is something mysterious going on. There is nothing mysterious. It is absolutely the most boring movie I have ever watched. I have never even written a review of a movie until now. I was expecting so much more and was completely disappointed. Critics are not stupid. They are correct that this movie is terrible. Two hours of my life wasted. If you are an educated individual with a shred of intelligence, I am telling you...COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME OMG. Apparently, I'm still not at the minimum length to submit a review...without giving details to the movie, I don't know what else to say other than it sucks, it sucks, don't watch it, it sucks, it sucks some more, don't watch it, definitely don't pay to watch it, download it if you have to but definitely don't pay, it sucks, it sucks, it sucks. Voila!"
" A Breath of Fresh Air
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,9,"Cast Away, in the future, with a huge twist.I need to start this review off by saying that it has been so long since I've enjoyed a movie at such a high level. From start to finish this film doesn't stop. There is a constant stream of emotion, action, and suspense. The characters are relatable, the pacing is great, the special effects are breathtaking (especially in 3D; and I HATE watching movies in 3D but this one is worth it). Watching Chris Pratt, who I now consider an amazing actor, fight a morale tug of war both mentally and physically was blast. Had it been him alone throughout the entire film I'm sure I would have enjoyed it and perhaps given a 6 star rating. But adding Jennifer Lawrence some way into the film, and certain twists in the story, made it incredible.Highly recommended! Family friendly! Watch it!!!"
" lit. the worst
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,1,"7,1 on average? Are we there yet? Have we finally gathered all the dumb audience in the auditorium?! This Movie is the worst.. the writing.. oh dear lord the writing.. done by a 3 year old. You can tell exactly what is going to happen within next 5 minutes and guess what.. IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS. Thats not caused by me, being some super smart genius, it's bad writing par excellence. Eh lazy guy who did the first draft on a napkin, give me a call.. I handle this s*** for you.What an insult this movie is. You can just stack all the money you wasted on this s*** on to one big pile and light it up, same result. This Movie is Event Horizon II, because it was hell to watch."
" Great film
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,9,"Hadn't heard of this film, went along on a last minute invite. So glad I did. The film is spectacular visually and the time flew by (a sure sign of a film enjoyed). Lot of discussion afterwards, some picking the story apart, some not too keen on the actors.We all know the story and my bug bear was it was too predictable - will film makers ever give us a surprise ending? The only reason for the awakening of the second passenger was for sex scenes and shots of JL's body (which I'm sure most men are not complaining about). The scene with the wedding ring was sick bag enducing and what did the waking up of a third passenger bring to the story other than to fill some time.One poor reviewer questions why the ship was so well stocked and had sports and leisure facilities etc. They obviously hadn't heard us being told that the crew would wake up so many months prior to landing, and the passengers sometime after them.On the whole a visually stunning and great film to watch. Point taken off for the predictable storyline. Michael Sheen gave a usual understated, brilliant performance."
" Good, but doesn't take enough risks
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,7,"I have to say I liked 'Passengers'. I wasn't too sure what to expect going in. I like the two leads enough (I don't love Chris Pratt but I can tolerate him and appreciate his charm at times), but I wasn't sure how much this was going to be about them, or how much it was going to be about a sci-fi story that just happened to feature them. I think they got the balance about right. There's actually a real character study in the story. There are some (one in particular) very complex decisions that the characters have to deal with and sort through and the ramifications of those are fascinating to watch. While at the same time I really enjoyed the sci-fi side of things. The concept was an interesting one and the complications that arose made for interesting viewing. There's some terrifically balanced writing featured in this film.My only problem with the film is that it didn't dare to be great. There was an ending which I actually expected to happen, that would have made this movie great in my opinion. If Chris Pratt's character 'Jim' had in fact died and then Jennifer Lawrence's character 'Aurora' had been faced with the same decision he had been faced with earlier in the film, I think this film could have gone down as something very special. The fact that I suspected this ending might be the case during the film, and was still willing to accept it as great if it did turn out that way, shows just how strong of a piece of writing it would have been. Unfortunatey though it was not be. And while this film is well made and a fun watch I fear it will fall into the forgettable category for not having the guts to do something more than a cliché Hollywood ending."
" Frustrating. Great premise, many well done parts, laziest script ever
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,6,"The film look great. Lots of excellent special effects to make it convincing. Excellent cast. Compelling story. Very funny parody of what life may be like in the future. But boy does it ever fall flat as a board towards the end. And the ending is rushed, lame, pitiful and quite unbelievable. The first hour is set up in a little quickly but it works, in spite of some stilted dialogue and scenes that should have been redone so that they didn't feel as if they were scripted and unnatural. But that's a minor quibble given how much I liked the premise and much of where the story was going. Pratt plays a man on a 120 year or so trip to another colony in space to live in luxury. This premise is completely absurd for many reasons (such as what you'll see in the movie.) During the journey he awakens very early after an asteroid strikes the ship and causes a malfunction. And he can't go back into hibernation (why... good question. Perhaps they thought the ship would never suffer the problem.) And he finds himself alone... very alone. And as a result he must make some difficult choices.Jennifer Lawrence obviously appears in the film. She does a great job with what she's been handed. Michael Sheen as the bartender is perfectly cast although very little is done with him. The real problems are contrivance that begin to work their way into being positively annoying and dumb when ""the twist"" happens during the film that changes the course of everything. It's the kind of mistake that shouldn't have been made because the character wouldn't make such a mistake. And from there the film ends up traveling at light speed towards phony. It never recovers from that fatal misstep.It's unfortunate that a film with the potential for so many great directions falls so flat in the second half. And for this reason I've given the film a very generous 6. You may really enjoy the atmosphere and the premise. But when it fails you may feel cheated by a very lazy effort. It's disappointing. Could have been a top film of the year."
" Finally - we're back to making proper Science Fiction movies
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,10,"Wow... wow... and again wow! Finally a movie that's so much better than expected. Not another prequel, sequel, or whatever-quel, but something new, something creative, something exciting and something very well made indeed.Great actors (still hugely overpaid though), great acting, great special effects, great story, and excellent plot.Okay, so I'm a huge Science Fiction fanatic, and movies including Passengers, Bring Him Home and Interstellar show that it's perfectly well possible to make great S.F. without the need for another cash- cow sequel, prequel, and yeah, horrible-quel. Please NO MORE Star Wars movies!The good thing is that this movie somehow creates a believable atmosphere, and seen on the big screen, you'll often have the feeling you're travelling on the Avalon with the actors. Hahaha... I was thinking Spaceship Titanic (Douglas Adams) every now and then, especially with the various robots depicted, but that was only positive as clearly this movie reminded me of some good S.F. books.Anyway, hope to see more good S.F. movies in 2017. This has been a perfect start!"
" My New Favorite Movie
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,10,"I was most impressed with Passengers' depth of story line and plot through the use of only three characters (four if you count the Android played so elegantly by Michael Sheen.) It had all of the struggles that come with the human condition portrayed in a glamorous, yet intimidating setting. The successful characterization and use of internal and external conflicts lead to an amazing plot and well-developed themes.It has loneliness, wonder, hope, lust, and fear all within a visually STUNNING setting.The main character, a simple-minded mechanic named Jim was portrayed convincingly by Chris Pratt. The chemistry that Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence shared, rivaled that of Jennifer Lawrence & Bradley Cooper in ""Silver Linings Playbook."" Jennifer's depth of emotion made Passengers convincing on so many levels. My new favorite movie."
" Simple/simplistic or fundamental/elemental? For me, the latter!
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,9,"This film from Director Morten Tyldum has quite a lot going for it. First and foremost, it is incredibly bold in its envisioning of the future, with spacecraft travelling to the stars on missions extending in length to centuries. (in this scenario, Arcturus, at 36.7 light years away from Earth, is a point closer to the beginning of the journey to ""Homestead II"" than the end; with a close pass of that star being used to further accelerate the truly gigantic vessel, the Avalon). Not the slightest hint of how we got to that from our present primitive, first-toe-in-the-water stage is given here, and that is surprisingly refreshing: we may simply take for granted that this kind of technological level has been reached somehow, and go on and ""enjoy the show"".I certainly did! While the most recent Star Trek movie, ""Gravity"" and ""Interstellar"" all set high standards for imagining vessels and worlds into existence, ""Passengers"" takes the prize for me; the ship is simply exquisite, but also surprisingly ""realistic"" and believable. Inside, it is sumptuous, full of hi-tech ready to serve; but that comes at a price - the more you pay, the better standard you get. Shades of the Titanic, but - although our great vessel does indeed sustain a serious collision that injects some edge into the story from the very outset - all is at first subsumed by a rather light touch, as the commercial side of this venture is made abundantly clear.This then is no Star Trek-like exploration, no military/public-sector mission, no last attempt of human civilisation to escape the Earth and save itself for posterity. Rrather, it is a paid (basically one-way) passage to a new world, whereby 200+ crew serve 5000+ passengers/colonists/upper-class economic migrants, but all are in suspended animation for just about the entire journey.All, that is, except for one unlucky guy Jim (a very good part for Chris Pratt), who is awakened from stasis by the aforementioned collision and proceeds to ponder/despair on how he is going to manage for decades with only machines of various degrees of sophistication for company. The latter reach their peak in (the top half of) barman Arthur (Arthur in Avalon - get it?), as very well-played by Welshman Michael Sheen. Sweetly, various systems on the ship also feature the British voice of Emma Clarke - art imitating life, as Emma also voices the London Underground, and - to the best of my knowledge - also many lifts (elevators) around the world.Hence the ""canvas"" against which the main drama plays out is huge and stark, but in other places also rich and entertaining.Now set that against a surprisingly simple storyline that nevertheless has a very great deal of meaning to offer. There is a definite hint of The Bible in here, as our lonely Adam in his Paradise needs an Eve, and he commits a kind of ""original sin"" to get one (in the pleasant enough shape of Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence)). Not too many more clues from me over that, but let us say that we get to think about many issues of basic human need and loneliness, and what these things can justify. This occupies much of the film, as does a rather beautiful (and at times erotic enough) on-and-off love affair between the stars (in every sense of the term).Eventually, briefly, our two humans are joined by a third. But for a lot of the time, it's just the two of them, with hopes, ambitions and memories, and of course with Arthur the android, who is a great deal better than a laptop, but can't quite bridge that gap to full humanity.Given that we also have several sub-stories about the desire to hand-make things in a ship that repairs and maintains itself (or at least should do), the desire to bring untidy nature into these rather clinical commercial and entirely human-oriented surroundings, and of course a main plot line about those same surroundings gradually deteriorating into a death trap, there is a lot said here about loneliness, love, meaning, need, sacrifice, devotion ... and basically what is superficial in our lives and what isn't.The film's very final plot device is justified artistically, and quite moving, even if it resembles the beginning in deliberately dodging a number of difficult and complex moral/ethical (and also intellectual) questions. This ""less is more"" approach is interesting, and all the more so when we note that some moral and intellectual issues ARE addressed in detail here, while others are skimmed over. Since I normally ""demand"" an entirely cohesive scenario with no plot holes, I surprise myself by noting how much of a virtue the approach taken by ""Passsengers"" actually turns out to be. It evokes an idea of ""Impressionism"" that goes a long way to confirming the status of this particular film as a piece of art. It also suggests that the makers are firmly in charge of their film, and know what they want/choose - and do not want/choose - to achieve with it (actually a rarer commodity than it would seem these days, given certain recent, utterly-chaotic sci fi efforts on the big screen also reviewed by me!) This is then what I personally have been looking and hoping for for some while: sci fi in a spectacular, at times stunning, setting, but with heart and brain alike in very much the right place."
" Very enjoyable film
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,8,"This was a very enjoyable film with some great acting, great sets and good production values. However, most importantly it was an excellent story with a superb 'moral dilemma' at the heart of it. I found myself struggling with what the main protagonist had done, but ultimately feeling sympathy for him, in the sense that perhaps he had been unable to control his emotions. Chris Pratt was great but if I had to choose, then Jennifer Lawrence stood out for me. Action, drama, love, forgiveness, what's not to like? Although it was over two hours long, I was so gripped that I could barely believe it when the film finished. This is one I will see again and will be looking for the Blu-Ray too..."
" No plot
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,2,"I've just watched this movie and like some other reviewers, I ended up checking my watch half way through it.Great actors, that's about it. Had potential, but the plot was so under-developed, to the point where nothing really happens in this movie - no proper love story development nor sci-fi plot. About the only wise line throughout the movie is that you should not wish you were somewhere else but make the most of here and now. But jeez, I've heard this saying so many times and watched so many movies on this topic that were done a lot better than this. Conclusion, it can hardly be called a sci-fi or love story/romance."
" Great Entertainment that even leaves you thinking about it
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,8,The premise on which this movie is build on is rather interesting. But after watching the trailer I just thought that this would be like any other action Blockbuster. Yes you have your action sequence at the end and yes some parts of the story are very predictable. BUT! Not all of them. I was totally taken aback by one major plot twist. I won't say anything more because I want to keep this review spoiler free. But this movie has got so much more depth than you might expect from the Trailer. Sadly the movie casts this over board a little bit to quickly in exchange for a action climax with happy ending. Which fits perfectly in the story line and all but it just gets very predictable. Thats why there are two stars missing. I think its unnecessary to say that Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence do a real good job keeping you interested in everything that's going on between the two. Perfect Chemnistry. My Fazit: Go watch it. Not a masterpiece but sometimes all you need is good entertainment and that's what you get.
" The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,4,"...and the award for the most disappointing film of 2016 goes to Passengers! I can't tell you how long I waited for this movie to come out, it was at the top of my must see list for months, and I was more excited to see this than almost any other film this year. For those unfamiliar with the story, five thousand passengers are in suspended animation for one hundred and twenty years, as they prepare to start a new life on a brand new planet. Thirty years into the journey, there is a malfunction and two of the sleeping pods open, awakening two of the passengers ninety years early. Everything I read and saw made this look like THE film to see this year, but the truth is it was beyond boring. This malfunction that awoke them, was part of a cascade failure, meaning small failure got worse over time, years in fact, and nothing serious actually happens until the last twenty minutes of the film. Until then, it's a lot of talking, romance, sadness about how they'll waste their lives alone on this ship for nothing. This had to be why the studio paid two of the best young actors in Hollywood a ton of money to be in this thing, because they knew no matter how boring the story or bad the reviews got, people would still go to see Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence. Congratulations Columbia Pictures, it worked, you made your money on this one and yes the special effect were cool, but how many people were actually entertained by this film? I for one was not, this film come in at just under two hours long and I felt like I was sitting in the theater for a week, that right there says it all."
" Thank god no exploding death stars - Great film
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,9,"Loved this film, good old fashioned love story, set in a believable outer space setting created with wonderful special effects. Best part of script for me is the way, a modern young woman, played by Jennifer Lawrence (very good in the role, stole the show) realises, just how, important connecting with your newly found soul-mate is, for at the end of the day,that is all that really matters. Like a lot of young women these days,used to being in control and having and doing things their way with no compromise, the circumstance Aurora finds herself in puts all that is important, to all of us, into clear perspective. Chris Pratt is very believable and well cast as her love interest and protector and an engineer/mechanic ""good with his hands"". As the film states, two people who on earth would probably have never crossed paths, but love finds them anyway. Michael Sheen rounds out the cast, as the perfect ""english gentleman"" bartender and the perfect foil and confidant for both Lawrence and Pratt to bounce their inner most secrets, thoughts and feelings off. With enough suspenseful moments to keep the movie flowing at a balanced pace. May I suggest forget the film critics and go see it!"
" argh! Such a shame!
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,8,"What a pity! During the last 3 years of going to the cinemas there was not one contemporary movie with the slightest chance to get full 10 stars from me. And now The Passengers nearly ticked all the boxes. And - so sad - failed finally without any need. How could that happen?? Please, Columbia, and please, Mr. Tyldum give us a Directors Cut and fix the minor problems of that movie. 1. find another reason for the couple for not being able to go back to traveling sleep. For sure the space ship traveling service would provide the machinery for woken up technical personnel to go back to sleep, 2. make the final of the movie regarding repair of the atom reactor less dramatic and 3. don't overdo it with all the circumstances to bring Preston back to life. A less dramatic rescue of the spaceship would have done it perfectly. Why I still give 8 stars: wonderful pictures, wonderful acted. But mostly, I myself expect from a SciFi-picture that I am not bothered with an unnecessary love story. But a good movie also provides something new and surprising. The Passengers did this. Because it placed a love story in SciFi a n d it worked out. And so I was surprised. In a very positive way. I got emotionally extremely touched by Lane and Preston. And I could have done without all the final action at all. This movie is a great achievement. And - (I have not seen La La Land yet) - in my humble opinion Lawrence, Pratt and Tyldum should be Oscar candidates. I recommend this movie wholeheartedly. Go and see it. It is a must. Believe the high praise of the top IMDb high praisers regarding this movie."
" Not like all the other movies set in space.
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,10,"Passengers tells the story of Aurora Lane(Jennifer Lawrence) & Jim Preston(Chris Pratt). Jim & Aurora are two out of thousands of people, traveling on a spaceship, that is taking them to a new planet. An unforeseen breakdown causes Jim & Aurora's hibernation pods to open too early. Now, Jim & Aurora are the only people awake on a spaceship, that still needs 90 years to reach its destination. Passengers is an excellent film. The best part about this movie is that, it doesn't have a similar story to all other films set in space. The script by John Spaihts is unique. Director Morten Tyldum has successfully brought to life Spaihts' one of a kind story, to the big screen. The visual effects are flawless. The 3D works for the most part of the movie. Jennifer Lawrence is spectacular as Aurora Lane. Chris Pratt is outstanding as Jim Preston. The sizzling chemistry between Pratt & Lawrence, is the highlight of the film. Michael Sheen is great as Arthur. Laurence Fishburne is brilliant as Gus Mancuso. Passengers is a must watch, for everyone who loves sci-fi movies with romance in them."
" The fact it has a paid for IMDb page should set off the first warning sign!
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,4,"Don't believe the studio's paid reviews by users that say its a good film. The fact it has a paid for IMDb page should set off the first warning sign!A boring story with a Hollywood ending that should never of happened and isn't plausible.If you want to watch a film with a love story that would never happen, with feats of engineering, luck & chance beyond recognition, you've found your movie.This is a bad review, I can't bear to even think about this film enough to structure a good review. Put this in the pile to watch after Dude Wheres My Car 2."
" Self indulgent star vehicle
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,3,"I have no idea how people are giving this such stellar reviews (excuse the pun).It really is just a big budget SciFi chick flick, with a extremely tedious story and five minutes of ""action"", presumably to make the trailer more interesting.If I'd been just a little tired, it would have sent me to sleep early on.A brief summation.Man wakes up accidentally on long space voyage, realises he will die before they reach their destination.Man gets thoroughly bored and wakes up a pretty girl to keep him company (and presumably for a shag).Girl finds out and hates him.The ship is in peril, so he saves it with her help, then volunteers to use the only means available to put her back to sleep.She stupidly decides to forgive him and stay with him.They both die.How on earth did anyone sanction spending 110M on that crap?It could have been an hour long Outer Limits episode and they'd still have to find something to fill the gaps."
" Well acted and beautifully presented
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,9,"I went to see this film not sure of what to expect, other than the basic ""Robinson Crusoe"" concept of a man stranded on a long journey in space. I knew the critics had panned it but the visuals looked great in the trailerPassengers turned out to be a simple but beautiful movie carried effortlessly by the two leads. This is not an action adventure movie, rather a study of humanity and how people react when given extreme choices. I thought the acting was first class – Jennifer Lawrence surely has to get an Oscar Nomination for this – the ship was luxurious and well-appointed, and was of an intriguing design.I can see why it has been criticised – there is a surprising lack of fail-safe and emergency procedures in the event of calamity; I didn't understand why any Passenger couldn't be returned to suspended animation once awakened; and even I spotted that Arcturus couldn't be reached in 30 years if the Avalon is travelling at half the speed of light.These plot-holes do not detract from the effectiveness and enjoyment of the film, though. Its 116 minutes slipped by effortlessly and I felt that my admission had been well spent.Highly recommended – 9/10"
" movie starts at the wrong place
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,6,"The Starship Avalon is transporting 258 crew and 5000 passengers in hibernation to the colony on faraway planet Homestead II. The ship is hit by debris and malfunctions slowly infect the system. Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) is awaken when his pod malfunctions. He is all alone except for robot bartender Arthur (Michael Sheen). He is unable to access the more sensitive ship systems. After a year of loneliness, Jim is suicidal and then he falls in love with Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence). He decides to disable her pod and wake her up but keep the decision from her.This movie needs to start when Aurora wakes up. His decision is workable storytelling if we figure it out along with her. It could be a mystery with tension that turns into an action thriller. Also the movie is too desperate to be romantic. The fact that the audience knows what he did makes it impossible to get into the romantic mood. By starting the movie at the later spot, it can inject some creepiness and tension. It also makes the movie shorter which would help a lot. These are two hot A-list actors. It's easy to see how the studio automatically goes for the romantic route but the story is built for a tense thriller."
" Good for a one time watch
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,7,"When you see Pratt and Lawrence name in a upcoming movie, you have to go and watch that movie. I was one of those people who did. Somehow I feel that Lawrence has the same voice modulation and reaction to similar set of situations which keep recycling after 'The Hunger Games Trilogy' and 'Silver Linings Playbook' where they were seen for the first time. I can link every reaction that she has to some point from the Hunger Games.Anyway, this movie is a good watch unless you have preconceived notion of a meticulous plot free of obvious plot-holes. If you are going to the theater/movie hall to see Pratt and Lawrence, you will have a good time. This film has all the necessary ingredients for a good film and in 8 out of 10 cases won't be felt as money wasted.The ending is what I felt was the weakest, just because one friend (more than 30 years back) that it's not necessary to be famous or remembered to count the life as well lived you don't have to let go of everything and live your entire life with one person and NOBODY around. Then one of the goofs mentioned in IMDb said and I quote""It's hard to reconcile the following two aspects of the plot: a) Jim states authoritatively that there is no way to induce a hibernation - that there is no machinery in storage that could do it; b) Aurora has bought a round-trip ticket and planned to be placed in hibernation for the return trip. If a return trip was planned, then there must have been machines in storage capable of inducing hibernation""Unquote.Thus they could have both started their lives on a new planet with lots of people around. Overall a good watch with a light snack."
" Passengers isn't as bad as you think.
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,7,"Critic reviews have bashed this film because of a certain action Chris Pratt's character, Jim, makes near the beginning of the film. This has lead to a lot of people saying that his actions were 'sexist' which I don't agree with. The main plot is about Jim and Jennifer Lawrence's character, Aurora, who are both woken up 90 years too early whilst on board a spaceship that's on a 120 year journey to a new planet. Because Jim is the first to wake up, he's completely alone, apart from an android bartender known as Arthur (Michael Sheen). Jim spends most of his free time with Arthur, getting drunk, playing basketball and also trying to make the most of his situation by finding a way to go back to hibernation. Unfortunately, after a year, depression kicks in which leads to him almost committing suicide. After walking back, he walks past one of the hibernation pods and notices Aurora in it, who is, clearly, a beautiful young woman. Now, isolation can drive people to become mentally unstable and make quick decisions. This is what happens here. Jim spends a long time trying to talk himself out of waking Aurora up but, unfortunately, he can't bear being alone and, because he's a mechanic, he knows how to wake one of the passengers up. Aurora believes that her pod has simply malfunctioned, like Jim's, as he can't face the truth. I think that people are being too quick to judge Jim and the entire film just from one action. Not one of us has ever been in his position where he's truly on his own. This is where Passengers succeeds, in my opinion, as it's caused some thought provoking discussions between viewers. Yes, Jim's decision could be considered a flaw but that's no reason to hate the film as there's so much to like about it. Yes, I do think it would've been better if the film was shown from Aurora's point of view and Jim's decision to wake her up could've been revealed as a plot twist but I'm not the filmmaker. Passengers could've been better but it's still, overall, one of the best science fiction films released in 2016, along with Arrival and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence both give strong performances as the two leads. In the run up to the film's release, they went on a international press tour where they visited various countries and did press conferences and interviews. In these interviews, I could clearly see the chemistry between them and it radiates on screen. A montage shows them having fun together by watching films, playing basketball, dancing and going to the bar, just like any normal couple and is one of the most entertaining parts in the film. The set design of the Avalon is exquisite. I can tell that a lot of hard work has gone into creating it. A lot of ships I've seen in science fiction films are quite standard and there's nothing special about them. However, the Avalon is like a outer space cruise ship. This is because the passengers are woken up six months before they arrive at the new planet and this is when they can enjoy the rest of the journey. The bar is also a clear remake of the bar that features in Stanley Kubrick's classic, The Shining. Passengers also feature some impressive visual effects. There's a scene where Jim and Aurora fly outside the ship and, because of the computer generated imagery, it really does look like they're in space together. The point I'm making in this review is that I don't think it's right to judge a film based entirely on one character's action. Despite the unfair negative criticism this received, this is still worth a watch for fans of thought-provoking science fiction and romantic drama. No, it's not as good as Arrival but at least it's not as bad as Independence Day: Resurgence or Jupiter Ascending."
" I wish there was a real driving force for this sci-fi romance.
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,7,"An attempt to get two of Hollywood's biggest actors together, Passengers is a romantic sci-fi where a colonisation ship is traveling to its destination when a hibernation pod fails and wakes someone up...90 years before it reaches Homestead II. But is this destiny? Is there a greater meaning to this? Or are these questions actually pointless as the film does not explore them at all? I can tell you the last question is correct. Whilst this does boast an impressive cast and director, the script and story lets it down. I shall start off by saying that Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence are perfect in this film. They both have charisma, charm and plenty of humour and the chemistry between them is believable. Michael Sheen plays an android bartender and is the comic relief, his British wit was much needed. Laurence Fishburne is also in the film, but I shan't spoil his character...though what I will say is that when he appears, the film turns around and says ""I bring you...plot conveniences!"". Honestly, the storyline was just filled with so many conveniences that it infuriated me, not to mention the last act of the film that was just ridiculous. Chris Pratt's character is a convenience, the ship malfunctioning is a convenience...I would even say the conveniences have convenience. There could've been so much purpose to this, a far more poignant ending and the critics would've loved this. In fairness though, I did enjoy this somewhat. Morten Tyldum did a great job directing with plenty of wide camera shots and nice still panning shots, it made the Avalon (the colonisation ship) look majestic. This brings me onto production, the design of the Avalon and the computers, holograms...heck even the robots, it all looked fantastic! Some great creativity was used, it's just unfortunate that the film will only be remembered for that. Thomas Newman composing though, euphoric! Possibly one of the best soundtracks for a 2016 film, I loved it. I mean don't get me wrong, this film is enjoyable. The romance is what people want to see and I became invested in them, I believed that they would make a good couple and even with a heart breaking revelation, I still wanted them to be together. The script even dabbled into themes of loneliness and solitude, it just wasn't explored thoroughly enough. Overall, Passengers has two great actors and great production, but the flawed story that's full of plot conveniences makes this rather boring at times. The soundtrack however, I would give full marks!Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com"
" A brave movie that presents a challenging moral dilemma without shying away from the consequences
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,8,"I watched Passengers yesterday and liked it a lot. It's not a perfect movie, but I was quite disturbed by some of the reviews I read. Some call it an ""interstellar version of social-media stalking"", or ""a creepy ode to manipulation"".I don't agree at all with these views and frankly I find that these comments say a lot more about our society today, so quick to judge and point fingers, than to the movie in itself, which has many flaws but manages to present a moral dilemma very well and doesn't shy away from the gravity of it.Passengers could have been a banal and controversy-free film very easily: if the two characters had just been woken up together by mistake, we would have spent the movie watching them slowly fall in love while saving the ship. Instead, the filmmakers had the courage to present an incredibly interesting choice and its consequences.The key point of the criticism is the fact that Chris Pratt's character Jim decides to wake up Jennifer Lawrence's character Aurora from hibernation, in order to have someone else to share a lifetime of otherwise loneliness with. On top of that, in the end, she falls in love with him and forgives what he's done.Now, if I read what I just wrote, I admit there's a part of me wanting to judge this story as creepy and outright bad, but luckily I gave the filmmakers a chance and went to see the movie with an open mind. And I wasn't creeped out at all because the movie does an incredibly good job at putting us in Jim's shoes.Here is exactly where I think most of those who condemn the movie fail: if I honestly imagine myself in Jim's situation (ie. condemned to a lifetime of loneliness), I do believe that eventually I would give in and wake someone up. And what's best is that we are completely part of Jim's dilemma: he knows it's wrong and he does his best not to give in. But in the end, after over a YEAR of solitude with the prospect of the rest of his life being the same, he wakes up the woman he has gotten to know through her writing and videos, and whom he thinks he loves.So is this a justification for stalkers and manipulators? NO. It's not because stalkers and manipulators HAVE a real alternative, Jim doesn't. Stalkers and manipulators lack the ability to really sympathise with their victims and see them as objects, Jim doesn't.He's a man that does something terrible and never once during the movie does he think what he did was right. He then tries to confess, but is so lost in the happiness he found that he can't even bring himself to do that.Does this mean we should feel bad for stalkers everywhere? NO. It's a clever investigation of the human soul, of what we are capable of when pushed to the limit and of how important human interaction is to our very survival.Aurora's character arc is just as engaging and Lawrence's reaction when she learns the truth is brilliantly heartbreaking, result of great acting combined with great directing, so once again we feel the whole weight of Jim's action, just as both of them do.The rest of the movie is spent with Jim trying to make amends for what he did and Aurora slowly learning to understand why he did it and finally accepting it.I'm the first to admit that the second half of the movie, and the whole third act in particular, would have maybe worked better without the big action sequences, and that most of what happens feels convenient in giving Jim occasions to show his heroism to Aurora. I also personally would have preferred an ending where she chooses to go back to sleep. But these are just my own ideas, the movie and the character arcs work as they are and don't feel forced.So, is this a justification of manipulation, like saying 'it's okay as long as she accepts it at the end?' NO. Again, because of the extreme situation these characters find themselves into, casting a simplistic judgment on their actions and emotions is both meaningless and naive. Aurora takes over a year and goes through everything that happens in the action- packed third act to arrive at a point where she decides that she loves Jim IN SPITE of what he did.Condemning Jim for waking Aurora up and Aurora for falling in love with him in spite of that means choosing to be blind to everything that happens in between those moments, and it also means being blind to the reality of human life: that even horrible things can be forgiven, though of course this is not a justification for committing horrible things in the first place.If we compare Passengers with movies like the Twilight saga or Fifty Shades of Grey, it becomes evident how Passengers is light-years ahead of the other two. While Mr. Grey's clear, real-life stalking and manipulation is presented as an example of romance, Jim's weakness is human and sad as only great characters can be.I think the main problem people have with this movie is the fact that it's an intelligent movie WHILE ALSO being a big crowd-pleasing sci-fi blockbuster. If the same story had been made with unknown actors, a moodier tone and half the budget, how many of those reviewers on their high horses would have instead praised it?"
" Very good romantic story in space. Also great acting and directing
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,10,"This film is very touching. But you need to take yourself to the right mood. You need to see at the opening scenes and imagine yourself into the movie. Cold. cold space. Terrible emptiness, no way to get home, no way to contact home. And than you will feel a loneliness of the main protagonist. His desperation. His action is so human, it is quite simple to understand him. And love-line... you actually wish them happiness. Two lonely souls finds happiness despite crazy situation. I must say that I really hold my breath during scenes near the end. I actually fear that there will be bitter ending. And the ending was actually sweet with a few bitter drops. Also acting is supreme and directing is quite good. Also, 3d in space-movie? Always good. So my results: pretty good romance/drama in sci-fy setting. Intimate. Sweet. Good for watching with your girlfriend. Also very fast pacing - not a single dull moment. Also show why the age of professional critics is over. They don't write truth, they don't write according to viewers standards. They write according to critics community standards. They write with political agenda, current popular trend in mind. They find politics where there is none. They watch for plot holes without understanding a concept of suspension of disbelief. People are watching movies so go read viewers reports."
" Strong movie that fails to fulfil its ambition
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,8,"""Passengers"" has received a very negative appraisal from many critics, scoring a paltry 31% on Rotten Tomatoes at the time of writing. After seeing the movie, I find it hard to comprehend what it is that so many critics disliked. It seems to me that a film that has attempted a very ambitious concept and not wholly succeeded has been disproportionately punished for its ambition and that had director Morten Tyldum and writer Jon Spaihts aimed lower they might have been received more positively.At its heart, ""Passengers"" is a morality tale. Jim (Chris Pratt) is accidentally awoken 30 years into a 120 year space flight and, unable to put himself back to sleep, he faces spending the rest of his life alone while the other 5,000 passengers sleep out the rest of the journey. He becomes obsessed with Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence), a writer also making the journey. Before long, his desire for company overwhelms him and he wakes her up, condemning her to share his fate. Jim keeps his terrible secret from Aurora and allows a romantic connection to form between them.The concept is flawlessly introduced. The pacing of the first act is perfect, the film patient enough to display the desperation of Jim's position and throwing in enough humour to prevent things becoming unduly depressing. Jim's dilemma - encapsulated in his question to Arthur, the robot bartender (played wonderfully by Michael Sheen), ""If you were stuck on a desert island for the rest of your life and had the ability to wish someone there but neither of you would ever be able to leave, would you do it?"" - is a fascinating moral problem that the film at least begins to address with some depth. It is hard to imagine an audience member not asking themselves whether they think they would display the willpower to remain forever alone and spare the life of another.Unfortunately the film does eventually fail to maintain the serious examination of this problem and the third act of the movie descends into unnecessary action shenanigans and a woefully neat solution to the moral dilemma is forged. There are definite signs here that a room of suits decided that the audience shouldn't be forced to reflect on whether Jim should be forgiven for his actions or how human nature and endless empty time might interact with each other to produce complicated reactions that reach beyond the moral examination of a fortune cookie. For this the film does fail in its initial ambition.In my view however, the first 90 minutes of this movie are worth the viewing and elevate the film beyond the average popcorn movie that it could so easily have been from the outset. The performances from Pratt, Lawrence and Sheen are all very strong, aided in no small part by grounded, relatable dialogue from Spaihts. This everyman feel to the movie, so necessary to allow us to put ourselves in the centre of the moral dilemma, should have been allowed to continue into the third act, and is shattered by the unlikely heroics at the end.It does seem to me that had the creators of this film decided to begin this movie in a much simpler, more action-centred way, it would not have been so harshly treated and could easily have been received by critics in a way comparable to Marvel movies of recent years - conventional, predictable and well-trodden stories, capably rendered for the screen. By attempting something fresher and more complex, ""Passengers"" has instead been punished for reaching a little higher and coming one act short of something special."
" Very good movie
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,7,"Punchline: a great movie that successfully takes you to outer space atmosphere with a believable engaging story. The GOOD: story focused without shattered subjects. Most actors are well chosen & talented. successful feel of space life. adding a British actor(the bartender) was a smart choice to break free from the same Shylock azz-lickers circuit. Miss Lawrence is insanely beautiful. Effects, music, sound, and video are well suited with film substance. The Bad: Laurence Fishburne is talented, but was not fit for this role, he simply did not blend well. The space ship interior was successful but exaggerated.The UGLY: no ugly for this one, it is worth to see."
" Chuck the critics review
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,10,"Chuck the critics' review, first of all. When any space movies hit the theater, it's not always necessary to be like Gravity, Interstellar or Martian to deal with planets, gravity, fourth dimension or alien forms. Space related movie can have a simple plot to deal with as well, which probably disappointed the super minded critics. The passenger who woke up from hibernation pod were not a geek nor astronaut to do something incredible. Director showed us how any common man would react and try things out if he stranded for rest of his life. The movie definitely will not disappoint movie lovers. It has lot beautiful and cute scenes which will not make you feel bored."
" Passengers - An interstellar love story
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,9,"Passengers is by far my favorite sci-fi drama. It's on par with the previously released movies of the genre such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Interstellar, The Martian etc. Only here, we see a nice love story on the interstellar journey. Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt performed extremely well in the movie. Their chemistry on screen is what makes the audiences connect to the narration of the story. Brief but effective appearances by Lawrence Fishburne as spaceship captain and Michael Sheen as an android bartender leave their mark on the viewers. But it's the journey itself that's makes us glued to the screen till the end. Coming to the storytelling, there is not much, I would say, a malfunction in the hibernation pod makes the hero awaken prematurely only to learn that there is still 90 years of journey left in the total 120 year journey to reach the earth-like planet. Then how he gets a companion and live a little for the rest of his and her lives is dramatized very well.From astronomical sense, the interstellar journey is till not available yet to the human kind. But it's possible in near future that we humans may be able to find a habitable planet in our or neighborhood galaxy to colonize. It's already discovered that there is a planet that is orbiting one of the nearest triple-star system Proxima Centauri (orbiting other two stars Alpha Centauri A and B). What we are not capable of now is the means to travel with near speed of light to the nearest star which itself will take hundreds of years to reach there. As the famous astro-futurist Michio Kaku mentioned in one of his speeches, it's the engineering capability that's preventing us from travelling among stars. It's true that NASA did not yet invent other kinds of fuels such as nuclear/laser/gravitation wave riding/ hypothetical wormholes except for the current chemical propulsion which is used by rockets. It's not even confirmed that the planet orbiting Proxima Centauri, a red giant is with in the goldilocks zone with in the right distance from it's parent star making water and atmosphere possible. Leaving all these theories aside, the movie simply focuses love story between two humans who are alone on the cosmic journey - hence the title ""Passengers"". It's a very engaging narration from start to finish which cannot be described in mere words. There is not too much science element that would deviate the viewer and not too much love story either, but just the right amount of both which is what makes the movie a fresh. The other movies in this genre focus either too much on science or action or aliens or philosophical aspect. Though the movie is termed as a popcorn movie, I have thoroughly enjoyed watching it on the big screen. Though the movie becomes dull at times, there are some exciting sequences too such as floating in space out side the ship, gravity loss, slingshot around a red giant etc. Overall it's a very engaging movie. My rating is 9 out of 10."
" I was duped
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,5,"My initial thoughts after first seeing the trailer for Passengers was that it was a gross excuse to put Hollywood's two hottest actors on screen together. I saw that the critics had given this abysmal reviews and I wasn't surprised. I was however surprised to see that user reviews contradicted what critics had to say. Reviews contained descriptors like unexpected, great acting, suspense and the like. Well let me tell you this film was none of those. Passengers was forgettable. It wasn't bad, it wasn't good, it just was. Like I said, nothing more than an excuse to have studly guy and sexy girl on screen and cash some cheques while they were at it. The visuals were meh, the acting was passable, the script was something a fourth grader could have written. I feel like I've seen this movie 100 times in some different form. I'm only writing this to detract from the other user reviews that say to ignore what the critics are saying. Though it's not terrible it DEFINITELY isn't worth going out to see."
" Doppler effect missing
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,7,"I loved the movie , but ...Regardless of story line which is not stable and finally offers you a bit of each theme , there is a real technical problem scientifically.Avalon is traveling in near light speed ( otherwise it never reaches another planet in 120 years ) , the fact is here that on such speed we will have Doppler effect which causes actually the color of the light changes , therefore what we see in front and what we see in rear are effected. In the movie we have a Hubble like vision of space ... which cannot be there.Also this is not realistic to have only one Autodoc in spaceship for five thousand people! If I were, I would have picked up at least two...Thanks"
" A perfect blend of Sci-Fi and romance
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,9,"Seeing this movie now is a great fit for me, a week after Rogue One, a movie I also liked, but I find its classification as Sci Fi to be mistaken, for the simple reason that science as is, doesn't really play a role in the story, it's just being used for gadgets and weapons for a story about Good v Evil about corrupting Power against the power of Hope.While Passengers is driven by the science fiction idea of colonizing space and even more by the idea of people traveling in a fully automated ship hibernating all the way through their voyage. Without these two elements there's no story here. That's the reason this movie is first and foremost sci-fi. This sci-fi story drives a romantic adventure, or in other words, a love story about how two people can be an entire world among themselves if they do love each other. It's much deeper than the cliché itself, because the story is well written. The characters are superbly written, and the actors are next to flawless, only four roles but each one performed as close to perfection as I've seen in a long while, and three of these four roles called for the highest quality of acting. One last remark and a dual one regarding some comments I've read here. Regarding some scientific goofs in the script - these are plain nonsense. It doesn't matter at what real speed the meteor storm would look like, cinematically it made sense to show them at slow motion. It doesn't matter if the artificial gravity would malfunction under such conditions, this is one of the best visual ways of demonstrating that a space ship is falling apart. Another claim I feel I must refer to is that this is a rom-com. The fact that humor is used during the story telling doesn't make it a romantic comedy, there are funny moments because that's the way good relationship develop, but there's no comedy here. Just a very good sci-fi romance worth seeing."
" Passengers or extra of sugar with zero gravity
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,4,"Let's begin with something really important: trailer do deceive you sometimes and this is the perfect example of expecting to watch a determinate kind of movie and find something unexpected (and not in a good sense).When you watch the trailer you might expect some kind of ""Pandorum"" (minus the paranoia and all the horror) but sorry, this is not that movie. It is not an action/adventure movie where people are travelling in a spaceship with a new planet to live as destination and where someone awakes beforehand because there is something big, deep and dark behind it. Instead of that we find ourselves with something completely the opposite: a romance drama.Yeah, you heard me: romance drama. Something that is really good disguised in a science fiction environment, with a background mystery (which by the way is solved sooner than saying Schwarzenegger). For half of the movie, H-A-L-F-O-F-T-H-E-F-I-L-M we are presented with the two main characters and nothing, absolutely almost nothing happens. And I didn't feel so bored since watching the beginning of the last ""Fantastic Four"" movie, which lasted also half of the movie by the way. Then something seems to happen but no it doesn't, and then the finale.Although there are two frontlines in the movie and they have chemistry on-screen, the way the story is told is boring and you will find yourself looking at your watch every 5 minutes for the first hour, then you will be happy that something has happened but then the movie is over and time to go home!Titanic on space is what this movie has been called, but remember, Titanic has a good story and good dialogues, this one not so much. If you are a fan of the two main stars you may be excused, even more if you like science fiction. but believe me, you will be quite disappointed about the result. On the other hand, if you miss those 90s romance movies, please go watch it!"
" love story
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,6,"The story is somewhere in the future( we don't know exactly) when earth has already colonised far far away planets... the technology of course is very advanced , capable to structure gigantic spaceships with all the leisure needed for hundred years trips(!!!) , also robots (humanoid or else) and synthetic foods similar to real food from advanced machines...all these cannot be made for the next 100 years at least in my opinion... After all the above, u may wonder..if science has all the above abilities, why someone abandons the earth for a trip to the unknown and to primitive environments, knowing that he will never see any of the family, friends, etc? the only answer i can say, is the feeling of adventure or curiosity, but its not enough in my opinion to make such a trip, knowing that u may even die from an accident in space or unknown factors..anyway, lets don't let these questions to distract us from the story, which in fact , is a romantic story of love and devotion...the scenery is superb, the ship looks fantastic and safe, the technology magical, the characters believable .. I ll keep from this film the beautiful surroundings and the romantic story...all the actors were good but the ending was a little sudden...i liked it"
" Less Than Stellar
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,8,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5)THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: An entertaining but superficial love story set in space.GRADE: BSYNOPSIS: Two space travelers are accidentally awakened on their journey to the stars.JIM'S REVIEW: Love is in the air (or possibly in the stratosphere) on an intergalactic mission to another world in Morten Tyldum's space romance fantasy, Passengers. Aboard the spaceship Avalon are our space travelers (and their other 498 passengers). Chris Pratt's Jim Preston is a mechanical engineer and also the space prince to his sleeping princess, Aurora Lane, a journalist played by Jennifer Lawrence. It does sound like a post-modern day Disney fairy tale, but that's about as far as it goes. ￼On a 120 year mission to colonize another planet and start life anew. Jim is unexpectedly awakened from his hibernation pod 90 years too soon and must now come to terms with his own survival and that of all of his fellow passengers. Trouble arises as the spaceship begins to malfunction and his need for companionship and assistance is handled by his waking female partner. Their attraction builds slowly but it is inevitable...and highly predictable as the film follows its basic boy-meet-girl-in-space formula. Besides, it's nice company having Mr. Pratt and Ms. Lawrence cast as the misfit lovers is a no-brainer, isn't it?The lead actors have the prerequisite amount of charm and attractiveness to carry the film. They bring authenticity to the roles while also oozing the necessary sex appeal. It is their relationship that is the core of the movie and both actors share the right chemistry. The small cast also includes the scene-stealing Michael Sheen as their faithful bartender and sounding board, Arthur, and Laurence Fishburne as Gus, an officer from the crew.￼The production design by Guy Hendrix Dyas and CGI effects by Erik Nordby and his talented artisans are quite impressive. Visually, the film is stunning, even if script-wise, it all seems like an outer space soap opera dressed to the nines. The screenplay by Jon Spaihts does try to stray from the conventional aspects of a love story, but doesn't always succeed due to a central moral dilemma set-up that complicates our lovers' relationship. That aspect never resolves itself clearly. Still, Mr. Tyldum keeps the action moving and the melodramatics at a minimum, that is, until the climactic third act when the plot and action become so far-fetched and strain credibility.The film does carry some excess baggage in its desperate yearning to keep its romantic story-line afloat, and although Rodrigo Prieto's photography does have a graceful hypnotic fluidity with its rolling camera angles, Passengers is still a rather bumpy ride."
" My first ever review. I felt the negative critics have really done this film injustice
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,10,"One of the best sci fi movies I've seen. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Really don't get whats the problem with the critics and their negative reviews. Sure the movie is cliché and have happy ending, but the emotions and acting were real, not to mention about space and cool special effects, cool ship. I would watch the movie again gladly. Spoilers belowAs Gus says in the movie, 'the drowning man will always try to drag you down with him'. Can we fault him for what he did? If it were you would you have jumped out of the air lock instead? Not justifying what he did was OK, but he regretted it and would have taken it back if he could. Plus he is willing to sacrifice his life to save others. About jennifer lawrence forgiving him in the end, dude, you'd have died anyway, this guy did a selfish thing, he's sorry, and he saved you and everyone else in the end by sacrificing his life. What is there not to forgive him about?"
" The Full Package of What Makes A Great Film!
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,10,"Passengers is an amazing sci-fi romance thriller film that includes an all-star cast! Jennifer Lawrence as always, delivers a stellar performance that allows viewers to really feel the intensity of the film through her character as Aurora Lane. Chris Pratt delivers a great performance that allows audience members to feel the mental, physical and emotional pain through his character as Jim Preston.Passengers features, Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence) and Jim (Chris Pratt) who are two passengers on-board a spaceship transporting them to a new life on another planet. The trip takes a deadly turn when their hibernation pods mysteriously wake them 90 years before they reach their destination. As Aurora and Jim try to unravel the mystery behind the malfunction, they begin to fall for each other, unable to deny their intense attraction... only to be threatened by the imminent collapse of the ship and the discovery of the truth behind why they woke up.Pratt and Lawrence are a great duo, especially in films like these. There's mixes of different genres that gives the film the full package. Moviegoers are getting their money's worth through this film as it is spine-chilling, suspenseful, emotional and action-packed. This movie has it all! Passengers is a highly action-packed film that will keep you guessing. It's visual effects that dictates the future of space-exploration makes it feel as though it were real! **In conclusion, my overall rating for Passenger is 10/10**"
" What could have been a great sci-fi ends up a rom-com space opera mashup.
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,5,"The term mashup is not usually a compliment. It means mixing different genres in a way that looks interesting, gets a laugh, or makes a mess. It is unlikely the sci-fi rom-com melodrama Passengers (2016) intended to be a mashup but that is the result. If it stayed on-track as sci-fi, all the ingredients are present for an outstanding film but box-office considerations require a love story with a moral dilemma so the film ends up a mess.We are aboard an intergalactic spacecraft for a 120-year voyage as part of a commercial outer- world migration venture. The ship's set and digital effects are some of the best seen on film in years, conveying an enormity of scale and futuristic design that is mesmerising. Five thousand volunteers are ensconced in hibernation pods en route to capitalism's version of eternal paradise when one traveller, mechanical engineer Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) is accidentally awoken 90 years too soon. Travelling through space with every conceivable luxury at your fingertips, worry-free for the rest of your life, sounds appealing but the problem is that he gets lonely and conversation is very limited with an android bartender. After a year of flying solo he is on the verge of flushing himself into the cosmos, when suddenly he becomes obsessed with sleeping beauty Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence) and believes he has found true love.Of course true love is never that simple. He first must grapple with the moral horrors of his predicament: does let her sleep in peace for another 90 years so she can live in paradise with the 4,998 other passengers or does he do what the male species has been known to do sometimes and wake her up for some fun. The film trailers make the answer obvious, but when Aurora finds out that Jim was being selfish, she throws a galactic hissy-fit and the film turns into a domestic melodrama with more flashing stars than outer space. She refuses his every advance until the spaceship's gizmos turn wobbly. Forget feminism: a girl needs a guy when things get toughbut let's not go there.All the potential evident in the early part of the film is frittered away in a silly 'romance on the rocks' space opera, where it becomes a philosophical debate on which gender is capable of the greater quantum of selfishness. Pratt and Lawrence are really quite watchable in spite of the script, the filming is very entertaining, and the whole love scenario would have been interesting in someone's earthly kitchen but not on the most advanced galactic odyssey ever undertaken. But if you enjoy turbulent romance in unusual places this is your film. AUTHOR: www.cinemusefilms.com"
" This movie delivers on the 'taste' you got in the trailer.
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,8,"Passengers stars house hold names Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence who are heading to a new planet to help colonize a planet but the trip takes hundreds of years so they are in suspended animation for the trip. The trip take an inverted turn when the characters are woken from there sleep and end up being the only ones on the ship.Point I want to make with this movie is what annoyed me is a lot of reviewers for this movie are saying 'this movie is not what it seems, the trailer doesn't tell you enough' or 'it misconstrued the plot'. I am not going to give away what this is, but IT DOES NOT, repeat DOES NOT misconstrued, confuse or lead you in to a movie that is not what you are going to get. The trailer did something a trailer hasn't done in years....it doesn't reveal the entire movie. It gives you enough to know that this movie is beautiful, the set designs, the CGI is all amazingly beautiful as it should be and in that it peaks your interest... outside of solely peaking your interest this movie delivers the end product and does so very well.I will say that two thirds way through the movie I did find one minor detail just convenient and probably is a bit of a plot hole that is just brushed over, but in saying that it wasn't a ridiculous hole that doesn't have some possible logic, but could of been cleared with a simple 1 line sentence. This movie was a great opener for my 2017 and recommend everyone does that same to.If you want to continue this conversation you can hit me up on Twitter; @ohitsjustadamh"
" Truly amazing movie that was wrongly crushed by the critics!
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,9,"From the very beginning of 'Passengers', this movie grasps and holds on to your complete attention! Never have I seen a movie quite like this before, and I watch way too many not to be paid for it! 'Passengers' is beautifully comprised of thrilling suspense and great science fiction! From the fantastic visuals, to the questioning of morals, this movie takes your hand and doesn't let go until the ending! The critics are wrong for blackballing this movie! It's like they are all in cahoots and are bashing the cast for something else that actually has no relevance to this movie whatsoever! Now, it's not perfect; there are things that I might change if given the chance. But do yourself and significant other a solid - GO OUT AND WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!"
" A film about ethic and moral, including awesome views
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,9,"The film is fun and exactly like i imagined it before. In my opinion its the perfect mixture between action movie, drama and love story. There is no point where i thought that it gets slow or boring. Jennifer and especially Chris did an awesome job! In the beginning, when Jim is alone, you see how desperate it is. You understand why he is able to take and change a life. There is the big question included if he is allowed to do this. The bis moral question if he is the one who can decide to change a life. In my opinion there are just two opinions and I myself would do the same: Kill myself or wake someone. Yes its morally wrong but no one can ask to survive this alone. I loved how there is no word about the earth. What is up on earth, how is it, why do you go, how does it look. We have so many movies including this question. This one excludes it. AWESOMEAnd did you took a look on the ship. The idea, the design of the ship is so awesome. I think i would enter this one too. The swimming pool!Its an awesome movie and i will watch it a second time. Jennifer and Chris are a perfect cast. I think the question you have for yourself at the end is as follows: How can you make the best out of your life?I would love to see the planet or both of them when they are old, but yes, this wouldn't fit into the style of the movie. Awesome job!"
" Beyond expectations
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,10,"I was very impressed by this movie I wasn't expecting it to be this good! What was really good were some space mechanics that aren't really explained in detail but are amazing little details for anyone that's interested in space flight and interstellar travel, things like the water from the pool forming a sphere mid air when the ""artificial"" gravity breaks down and the ship sling shotting around a massive star presumably to save on fuel or to make the journey shorter. The one thing that I felt should have either been explained or shown in the end is what is the effect of these 2 people waking up 90 years before schedule and consuming all that food, air, water. that was probably portioned out to be used by 5000+ people on board over the course of the last 4 months of the trip. Will thousands have starved because these 2 woke up too soon and ate all the food? or am I just supposed to think they packed plenty of food. I mean how much KG's of food do 2 people consume in 90 years and how much toilet paper? is there gonna be anything left at the end? And also why would they wake everyone 4 months prior to landing? wouldn't like a day before suffice?"
" Ignore the criticism. Go watch it! Its awesome
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,9,"When i first saw the rating on IMDb, it was 6.6 with few thousand votes already. I thought to myself oh boy.. ""it turns out its a flop"". As the rating reached 7.1 over time and i saw my friend's reviews i decided to give it a try. I went to the theater with little expectation. Expecting some marvel style action, but boy was i pleasantly surprised.Firstly, graphics were flawless Secondly, the technologies of the future which the movie showed were awesome and thought provoking. For sure something that science lovers would appreciate. Thirdly, the story was captivating so was the acting performance. The lead character was exploring his environment and the tech of the ship and so was the audience and i think that's what made it enjoyable and attractive. Fourthly, as i mentioned, acting was top. The characters were interesting, funny, intelligent and the chemistry between the characters felt real.However the story had its weak moments. There were events which in short were not realistic but i chose to ignore. They were not big deal but it felt like it degraded the movie alittle bit. There was also the moral dilemma which i suspect is one of the reasons why it has such low rating and criticism. It's really about how each person perceived it. For some the end was bad, and others thought it was epic. But i personally loved it. The movie was exactly the type of movies that i love in spite of some of its weaknesses, therefore i rate it 10/10. Because i really enjoyed it and was captivated by it."
" Gravity, Interstellar, The Martian and another nice space movie
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,7,"Gravity, Interstellar, The Martian. These are all great outer space movies made in last couple of years. They were all nominated for Oscars and I wouldn't be surprised if even the newest space theme movie Passengers would receive a nomination for best achievement in visual effects. They are just stunning. But definitely no other nominations would be deserved.The movies runs for 2 hours but in reality something is happening only in last 30 minutes. Everything else is much more like a space travel documentary. But a really good one. There is not much action or dialogue but it still manages to entertain you and I enjoyed every minute of it. Didn't look at my watch even once.This movie is much simpler compared to all three already mentioned movies but that's a good thing. It creates different type of emotions. After watching previous movies my mind was broken to pieces (especially after watching Interstellar) and space travel was the last thing I would want to experience. But after watching this movie it all makes sense and I feel like I want to see space one day.It is not the best space movie but it is still quite decent and it is worth to be watched on big cinema screen rather than home. I am quite surprised that even few hours after I watched it I still think about it. This is not happening often to me."
" the romance is not the main theme luckily
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,7,"When my teen daughter asked me to go watch this flick i agreed on therms that it wasn't going to be a love story which is for me the kind of thing I don't want to see. Have seen the trailer it looked okay so I gave it a try.And in the beginning I did like it a lot, pure sci-fi which I thought was okay. But I was afraid once Jennifer Lawrence (Aurora) would come into this pure sci-fi it would quickly turn into a love story, which finally did. But did it bother me, not at all, because there were jokes mixed into the story which made me forget about the love between Aurora and Jim (Chris Pratt). And of course I did know that the bartender Arthur (Michael Sheen) did have a naughty side. Luckily the love came on the second side because the space ship needed to be rescued. Naturally this kind of flicks don't have blood or real action going on but there are a few moments that makes you want to see what will happen. On part of the effects used they are really stunning. The gravitation being removed in the spaceship does things with aurora in a swimming pool and that is really a must see. So having extreme good effects, a bit of jokes here and there and a good story made it all watchable even for an old fart as me. I hated 'The 5th Wave (2016)' for so man reasons but Passengers, well, I did like it. Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0,5/5"
" Good cinematic experience, auspicious premise but very poor execution
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,5,"The premise gave the movie a lot to work with but the finishing product was transparent, predictable, clichéd and frankly, cringe-worthy.To stay reasonably positive, going to watch this at the movies really payed off, the CGI is quite gripping on the big screen. The effects and the visual experience is decent if that's what you're looking for.However, the acting, the script and the general execution didn't do the promising premise any justice.Chris Pratt was less than mediocre at best, and (Aurora) Jennifer Lawrence's first scene of confusion made me think it was the first movie she ever acted in. Which disappointed me a lot because I'm such a fan, she has performed so much better in the past.My next point is either positive or negative, depending on your angle, but I felt like Aurora's main purpose was to perform as many activities as possible to get Jennifer Lawrence to show some curves. Perhaps Jennifer Lawrence's most humiliating role - for loss of dignity as she is a great actress.The script was totally predictable and clichéd: Jim (Pratt) would make a terrible mistake, he would make up for it by sacrificing himself in some way, causing Aurora to forgive him and they lived happily ever after.We all knew he would survive his suicide mission.. at one point I even thought (hoped in fact) that he would die in the ""AutoDoc"", but lo and behold, after Aurora's awful stuttering he breathes life...The AI bartender seemed to contradict himself in terms of his feelings and self awareness.The science as many have mentioned was flawed, especially the scene where they ""slingshot"" around the star and Pratt surviving the blast with a ""shield""?I remained hopeful when Fishburne entered the scene but his ""moving"" dialogue before his death - something about J.Law and C.Pratt having one anothers backs made me heavily cringe. And after that nothing could save the movie. Even the terrain within the spacecraft which was, in fairness, moving and original in stark contrast to the rest of the movie.Overall an enjoyable movie if you are bringing the kids to the big screen for a birthday party, but if you are serious about movies, save yourself the trouble of going to see it."
" Decent film, formulaic, but enjoyable nonetheless.
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,6,"(Originally published on my blog site, whingewood.wordpress.com)There were some good points; the ship itself and the society that the characters come from (corporation-run, heavily-reinforced class system based on wealth) were glimpses into a universe that was interesting. Also the idea that they regularly send these kinds of ships on 120 year journeys made me want to know more of that story.But the film isn't about that universe, it's about the two main characters and their interactions (which is fine, as it was marketed that way, so it's not like I was surprised by that), and it's upon these characters that we should judge the film by.Without wanting to go into spoilers, the part of the film where Chris Pratt's character is on his own for a year reminded me of the only good part of 2007's I Am Legend, where the character of Robert Neville (played by Will Smith) roams around with only his dog for company (in Passengers, the companion this time is the android bartender, Arthur).The rest of the film after that was formulaic, which in my eyes resulted in it being fairly mediocre. Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt both gave good performances, it's just that they didn't have much to work with. To top it off, the ending was far too 'Hollywood' for my liking, but that may be because I'm something of a cynic!"
" Well done - just enjoy and ignore critiques from sexual politics warriors
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,10,"One of the most entertaining science fiction films of the last decade.Viewers, please remember that films are often meant to be entertainment and not political statements or contributions to gender studies issues.Was very impressed by the film at both the techno and human interest level, not to mention the sheer originality of the concept.Well done and good performances by the rather limited cast.Only four folk on screen - and one was a robot bar tender.I regret to say that many of the usual politically correct suspects down here were hostile and some were bonkers (with anger) over the idea that a man chose an attractive female as a companion. Also that feelings were eventually reciprocated. So what and ho-hum."
" A space romance under a sci-fi plot
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,8,"The plot was exceptional for a sci-fi flick, two passengers travelling alone in the infinite space with no one for company, except the robotic bartender. The initial set up was good which was done in the first 20 minutes.The cast selection was the added advantage. Chris Pratt as Jim and Jennifer Lawrence as Aurora have portrayed a wonderful chemistry. The acting of both the leads has been the high of the movie. Especially the no-gravity scene was the top notch.But once the story has been set the dragging begins. Like Avalon (The spaceship) the story does search for a way to move along. At times the story derails from the Sci-fi genre, in simple words a romantic movie in space. The dialogues too have less impact and don't stay in our mind. The last 30 minutes of the movie is the savior, it manages to keep the audience engaged.The movie is worth a watch for the lead pair and the last 30 minutes. But sci-fi feel not guaranteed."
" Cheap ""love story"" for older housewives
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,2,"I don't understand the good reviews here, since this movie has absolutely nothing in common with science, comedy, common sense or the art of filmmaking. Not a single part of the ""story"" does hold the water here: of all the people on board (more than 5000?) only one awakes by mistake and he can't sleep back again since the ship combines incredible AI bartender with absolutely idiotic rest of the computerized systems (""I don't understand.""). Not to mention legendary rumbling sound in open space or Arcturus (cca 40 ly away) as a ""slingshot"" star or choice of the other ""to be awakened"" person (or the third, for that matter) and so on. Besides being an eye- candy pack of SFX and a good performance by Jennifer Lawrence, this movie is a pack of bad writing, meaningless plot and insulting viewers' intelligence. And it's not even funny. Oh, yes: there is some gardening here, like in Martian, but without potatoes. This movie cannot be recommended to anyone but inmates in some mental institution. They probably would not ask questions like ""why?!"". Avoid by all means (and then avoid some more)."
" A Sci Fi missing the Sci
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,4,"This was a substantial disappointment; it's not often I walk out of a cinema baffled as to the point of what I've just seen. Put simply, it is a creepy romance first and a sci fi... only in the marketing. What little science there is, is wrong (others have commented on sudden episodes of zero g, sounds in space etc) and there is just nothing to inspire the imagination which characterises good sci fi. With 3 human characters, there is also absolutely no threat nor tension. At one point in the film, an allusion is made to being stranded on a desert island and this is the point in a nutshell: with a little rewriting, this story could have been set in the middle of the Pacific with a volcano as the present danger. There was no need for a futuristic setting which would have done away with the jarring technical errors and plot holes."
" Starts pretty well, but then just so, so bad
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,4,"Passengers had a few things going for it, not least of all the casting choices. Since this is basically a story of two and a half people, there was no way it was going to work at all without the right actors. Even the plot starts off well with an interesting moral dilemma, but then it all goes horribly wrong. Can someone explain why, on a ship that's basically just a cargo vessel, there would be pools, entertainment, restaurants, windows, vast concourses, or a bar built in? Everyone's asleep for the whole trip, including the crew... For that matter, why would there be a manual lever to override a door? Who's going to be there to use it anyway? For THAT matter, why even HAVE a crew at all? The ship basically flies itself, so the crew is just on board to say adios forever to all their loved ones on Earth for no apparent reason. Of course you could also bring up the speed the ship is going, which would not allow for little jaunts outside. Or how it makes no sense to leave the robot bartender operational for 100 years to serve nobody. Or surviving next to huge amounts of radiation because you're holding a scrap of metal. Or how the computer announces that they're passing a star (at near light speed) and how everyone should go look even though if everything was going according to plan, nobody should be there to hear the announcement. Except maybe if you could come in and out of cryo sleep, but no, you can't.Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb."
" A Beautiful Sci-fi Romance

The sets are impressive and the designs are stylish.The music is perfect, adding the right touches at the right moments.The story is original, clever, and it moves along well, keeping every scene interesting. I can understand why the actors, upon reading the script, wanted to be in this film.The relationship between the two main characters is touching. It is also more complicated than the typical formulaic love stories.The story also contains some moral questions. How nice to experience an intelligent film with some ambiguity that challenges the viewer, combined with a romance that has emotional depth.One of the best films of the year."
" A Spiritually and Emotionally Complex, yet Incredible Movie
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,8,"Passengers is an amazing Sci-Fi movie in many ways based on the current dream of placing humans on another planet. The destination in Passengers is to an unknown universe and system that requires 180 years of suspended space travel through the outer regions.This movie introduces some very complex ideas about the meaning of life, purpose and ""What-If"" scenarios. What if you're traveling through space and things go wrong? What makes a person happy? Can love grow and develop between two strangers based entirely on need and circumstances?In one way, Passengers is a retelling of the Adam and Eve story from the Bible in the book of Genesis when God say's, ""It's not good for man to be alone"" and ""There was no suitable partner for the man"". Which in the bible led to God putting Adam to sleep, pulling out a rib, and molding it into a woman name Eve. In Passengers the Man gets lonely, finds and researches one woman out of the millions sleeping in their pods, and awakens her.As the story progresses, there are some typical moments you already know what is coming next, then the movie forces what seems like a no win scenario which ultimately requires a single question to be answered.The ultimate question is, ""Is there any gift, greater than sacrificing oneself for someone you love, or even strangers you will never know, who will never know what you did, or know your name?""Passengers is about love, companionship, friendship, lust, selfishness, desperation, loneliness, sacrifice, redemption and realizing that true happiness does not depend entirely on your environment or circumstances. It presents the idea that love is a decision.While I greatly enjoyed this movie, I was disappointed with the ending, perhaps I just didn't understand or relate to its metaphor, or perhaps it just didn't go far enough.The movie ends with passengers awakening long from a long deep sleep. They step out into the cavernous space of the ships interior and glance in bewilderment at the trees, bushes and plants covering the inside of the ship.This eludes to a theme presented mid-movie about the main male character planting and growing a tree. It also eludes to the male and female characters finding happiness with each other within the context of their situation. Ultimately, making the best out of being stuck on a ride which still needed 80 mores years. In response, they adapted the ship by turning it into their own paradise, or garden of Eden.What I feel would have been a more fitting and perhaps interesting ending, would of been a whole new culture and several generations of families born and raised as a result of this single man and woman. It really seemed like the whole concept of pregnancy in space was skipped. Regardless, it seems that in addition to massive overgrowth of vegetation, the newly awakened passengers could of been greeted or been introduced to an entirely knew population of people born during the last eighty years of travel.The couple was young and highly sexually involved, no birth control available most likely, it just seemed logical that a child or several children would of been born, the ship was more than suited and capable of being able to sustain them.Other things I both enjoyed and hated about this movie:Several different events force the potential of dying in the vacuum of space, or drowning. Those scenes really captured my imagination and made me ponder the ""What If"" questions about death by suffocation.The introduction of a third person traveling with them through space, posed an interesting question as well. Would they share the woman? Would he awaken someone of his liking? Also interesting are the discussions regarding the costs of building the ship, the travel, and the cost to make an emergency phone call back home.Somewhat unsettling was the concept of being on a ship, where every living person is asleep with only technology to help in a crisis.Final Thoughts, at times its a little slow, other times wildly intense. From a filmmaker perspective, I think this movie is brilliant! It's the ultimate concept that many filmmakers, especially low-budget filmmakers grapple with. Is it possible to make a full feature movie with four or less characters all within a very limited amount of space. Passengers, pulls this off like a champion, with only three (Possibly, four if you count the android) characters throughout the entire movie, all within the confines of a single ship traveling through deep space."

",2017-01-06 00:00:00,8,"Passengers was an emotional and adventurous joyride. It took me for a spin that only 'Interstellar' and 'The Martian' had done prior. Guardians of The Galaxy star Chris Pratt truly showed his inner Matt Damon in this movie. I felt the urgency of fixing the fusion drives while the loneliness settled in. Truly this is one of the best Sci-fi movies I've seen in years. The movie provides a strong emotional rapport with its viewer. Once locked into the emotional aspect, you are stuck.Jennifer Lawrence once again was stunning. She truly showed me that her in a sci-fi movie isn't a bad idea. She would reach through the screen and grab the viewer by the ventricles of the heart and tug. I believe this movie deserves a nomination for 'Movie of The Year'."
" Two hours of nothing happening
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,4,"Passengers is yet another production that you will forget the moment you leave the theater.While the subject of the movie is the malfunctioning of a spaceship and the tragic faith of some of its passengers, it never really becomes a drama or a tragedy. No emotion for you, average 15-20 year old target viewer. Instead, you get explosions and some robots for an hour, as well as a hulk (something for you ladies) who wanders around in a tank top bashing against the unbreakable walls and mirrors of the ship. Then, you have a completely predictable love story, a character that is awoken only to die a few minutes later to help move through the mindless script.It's not all bad. There are a few bright spots in this film: a/ gorgeous, sexy, blooming Jennifer Lawrence b/ witty robot-bartender that is the only funny thing in the film and expresses more emotion than the protagonists c/ space always looks captivating d/ Jennifer Lawrence, come on, I am serious! Jennifer, I know you are reading this, I would have awoken you as well!But two hours of all this? *Yawn*"
" Ignore the trailers, its a romance!
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,7,"Went into this with minimal information, a brief on-line review and the trailer, thought it was worth a go.The trailers do not reflect this film in anyway shape or form, the trailers show a bell's whistles action sci-fi adventure movie, the film is a romance movie with some sci-fi in it.This is less 2001 and more Romancing the Stone in space, look it up, a good 80's action romance romp. Be warned this isn't a sci-fi for ""the lads"" this one to go to as a couple.As a movie it's not actually a bad film,just badly advertised so'll get low reviews for failing to meet expectations.Martin Sheen as the barman is a joy and a great giggle to watch, jumps into the roll with relish, Lawrence Fishburn is only there for a blink but stamps himself onto his roll fully.Unfortunately the rest of the main cast, both of them, just look to go through the motions and just get to the end of the movie. In most instances this wouldn't be an issue or noticed but with Fishburn and Sheen on screen the difference in the two styles are very visible.BUT this isn't a bad film, it's not great but not bad."
" An Agreeable Waste of Time
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,8,"Set in an undetermined future time, Passengers has some 5000 space pioneers aboard a gigantic spacecraft en route from Earth to an undeveloped and unsettled planet called Homestead II. The travelers were eager enough for a new beginning that they abandoned all worldly friendships and associations, and submitted themselves to suspended animation, enforced hibernation, for the 120-year voyage to the distant Homestead II planet.Unfortunately, some thirty years into the voyage the spaceship runs through an uncharted asteroid field, which causes a system failure. One of the passengers, a mechanical engineer named Jim Preston, is accidentally revived from his hibernation. And after a day or two of exploring the cavernous space vessel, he realizes he's not only alone, but also likely to remain alone from the remainder of his life—his shipmates, including the flight crew, all will be remain in suspended animation for ninety more years.Preston is played by actor Chris Pratt. Pratt is a wonderfully engaging performer who's been attracting a lot of notice recently, not only from his starring appearances in such Hollywood blockbusters as Jurassic World and Guardians of the Galaxy, but also in smaller supporting roles in pictures like Kathryn Bigelow's 2012 film Zero Dark Thirty—he played a member of US Navy Seal team on the mission to kill Osama bin Laden—and Antoine Fuqua's remake of The Magnificent Seven earlier this year.Pratt's screen persona is similar to that of the late James Garner—a reluctant hero with a stubborn streak of integrity dire circumstances can't quite overcome, often conscripted by circumstances to step up and make a stand against forces which threaten others. But unlike Garner, Pratt projects an aura of sweetly childlike naiveté which seems to make audiences want to reach out and protect him.But as Vincent Price, Charlton Heston, and Will Smith learned in the various screen versions of Richard Matheson's I Am Legend, it's difficult for an actor to appear alone on screen for an extended period and still maintain the interest and emotional investment of the audience. And despite some support from the versatile Michael Sheen as an amiable android bartender who serves as a sort of Greek chorus, a solo performance is what Pratt needs to deliver for the first quarter of Passengers' 116-minute running time. Then his character makes a choice which risks losing the audience's goodwill entirely:After a year of isolation and despite the entertainment amenities and activities of the spacecraft—lounges, gymnasiums, nightclubs, movies, spacewalking, and the most awesome Wii system you're even seen—Pratt's Jim Preston is literally dying of loneliness. He's actually considering ending it all when he becomes emotionally obsessed with one of the 4999 fellow travelers still in artificial hibernation, a journalist played by the wonderfully charismatic Jennifer Lawrence.And the moment Jennifer Lawrence's unthawed feet hit the deck, the movie starts to zing. On full display in Passengers is Lawrence's plain-spoken, self-deprecating let's get this party rolling persona, which has endeared the actress to movie and television talk show audiences over the past handful of years.Lawrence's performance seems also to ignite something in Pratt—their scenes together are as charming as those between the title characters in Disney's Lady and the Tramp, and for much the same reason. As a means of making sure we're paying attention, the filmmakers have named Lawrence's character Aurora, an obvious nod to Disney's Sleeping Beauty, Princess Aurora.But also accompanying Lawrence's arrival on screen is the central on screen conflict: In waking Aurora prematurely from suspended animation, Jim has selfishly robbed her of her plans and ambitions for a life on Homestead II and beyond, for no better reason than to provide company for the lonely mechanic. What's going to happen when she finds out?The filmmakers are not too adept at explaining the science behind the fiction, but are fairly good at covering their tracks: Every time the audience thinks they've spotted an anomaly in the plot, a new wrinkle is introduced that might or might not smooth it over. That's almost excusable in Passengers, because it keeps us on our toes enough to allow other nagging distractions to slip by, such as why Pratt's character left the signature scruff on his face after he shaved off the rest of the fake-looking movie beard he grew during his year of isolation.The one distraction too large to ignore is that Jon Spaihts' script can't decide whether Passengers is a romance, a character study, or a science fiction thriller: It's too much of each and not enough of any. And despite some eye-popping special effects—there's a honey of a scene in which the ship's artificial gravity fails while Lawrence is taking a dip in the swimming pool—there's too much plot going on to pause and savor them.Norwegian director Morten Tyldum, who also guided 2014's The Imitation Game, keeps Passengers plodding forward evenly enough to resolve the various plots, although at times the movie seems as tedious as the 120 years required to travel from Earth to Homestead II. And Thomas Newman's techno-pop music score is pleasant enough, with a few old standards thrown in to augment certain scenes, but seems to have been composed for a more lighthearted picture. Whatever it is, Passengers is not a comedy.In the end, it's Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt who carry Passengers and sell it to the audience. The undiluted rapport they generate with the audience inspires us to forgive most of the picture's problems and deficiencies. It's an agreeable expenditure of holiday time. Unfortunately, instead of a love story, a persuasive science fiction saga, or a rumination on the effects of isolation, Passengers instead becomes an explanation of why movie stars are paid such enormous salaries."
" Not bad but slow
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,8,When I saw the preview for the movie i was expecting a huge action packed fun thrill ride well having now seen the movie i gotta say that I was just a little bit let down by the fact that there is hardly any action in the movie and I was hoping for more however it was able to keep my interest for a good two hours and that sweet little smile of Jennifer Lawrence made me crack a smile too she's a very beautiful woman who is a little firecracker just be warned that like i Sayed it's not a whole lot of action but a good movie oh yeah PS. You might not want to take young kids due to multiple scenes of side nudity brief swearing and some peril. But aside from that go see it
" Ignore the critics -- great film!
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,9,"I saw Passengers a week ago and I haven't stopped thinking about it. It's a really good sci-fi film with a unique concept. Sure, a lot of space films deal with ideas about isolation and loneliness, but not like this. The special effects are amazing, and the design of the ship is really cool -- not something I've seen before! Chris Pratt, Jennifer Lawrence and Michael Sheen are SO good. There was great chemistry and acting from all three of them. And Thomas Newman's score sets the tone and atmosphere perfectly, and I actually think it's his best work since American beauty. His emotive score really adds to the human element of this film. Top notch. I'm so sad to see this film get such poor reviews from the critics, because I loved it and honestly think it deserves much more praise."
" Why JLaw... Why ??
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,3,"I watched this movie last night so you don't have to. OMG. It is the definition of Cheesy. I feel bad for Jennifer Lawrence to have this on her list of films she acted in. I think that the secondary role she had in American Hustle will do her much more good on the long run than this one. Actually I believe that Passengers will be the bane of her acting career. As for Chris Pratt, I do not remember him from previous movies but I wasn't impressed with him in this one either. I am not sure whether to blame him, the script, the director, or all of the above but this movie will definitely not add any value to his career either. All in all Zero novelty, not a single original idea, not entertaining, not romantic, not scientific, not artistic, not funny. You're welcome. PS: Why do movie reviews have to be long and boring?"
" Decent Popcorn Flick
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,7,"Yet another polarizing movie from the year 2016, Passengers is neither as horrible as the critics say it is, nor as wonderful as Pratt/Lawrence fanboys/fangirls will go around telling their teenage friends.The movie does have a lot of pros, actually. The visual effects and set design are both wonderful, particularly the spaceship's exterior, and a beautiful swimming pool featured in several scenes (made all the more beautiful with Jennifer Lawrence's presence). The acting is pretty good overall, however Lawrence can be as bland as she is hot at times. Pratt plays the same character he always does, the likable every-man, but I can't say I've tired of it yet. The end credits song, by Imagine Dragons, is reliably good, even if it's not their best by a long shot. Finally, I can't say I was ever bored by the film... irritated and disappointed, yes, but never bored.The cons are more extensive than I wish they were. The movie borrows from so many other films, including Cast Away, Titanic, Gravity, and The Shining, just to name a few. And there are so many missed opportunities to make really great, original twists that are never utilized. There's also a certain actor that makes an appearance that doesn't really have much purpose... The second act drags a bit, and is less interesting than the other two acts, particularly the first one. Oh, and I can't forget to mention that Pratt makes a decision in the movie that will throw half of the film's viewers into a state of rebellion...Overall, Passengers was a decent use of $6.00 and an afternoon with friends, but not one you need to rush out and see, particularly when compared with other space films of late, such as Rogue One and Star Trek: Beyond. However, fans of sci-fi, such as myself, will probably be moderately entertained for a couple hours."
" Great Concept, Great Performances, Great Movie
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,10,"I will never understand how so many critics and, by extension, the ""word of mouth"" that ferments following their reviews, can be so wrong. This movie is a perfect example.The first time that I heard about the concept, I was intrigued and really started looking forward to it. Also, I like both Chris Pratt and, despite her recent annoying public forays into the PC world of Hollywood, Jennifer Lawrence. Both actors seem genuine, don't fall into the overacting habit in an attempt for critical accolades and make enjoyable movies. No performance in this movie was a let down, even the very limited time for Lawrence Fishburne who, again, is someone who doesn't disappoint. The story is well developed and the cinematography blows you away, particularly on a 3D screen. Granted, not the same concept as another great movie, Intersteller, but similar in ""feel."" Just like that movie, there's a lot of ""what ifs"" that make you think. One of the biggest is Chris Pratt's dealing with the question of waking up another passenger because of his own loneliness. I think anyone would have done the same and it wasn't haphazardly tossed aside as a given.Overall, I can't say enough good things about this movie and I really hope it doesn't get cast aside with so many other highly anticipated/marketed movies that fail to perform as much at the box office. Excellent movie overall and well worth your time. Give it a chance and you'll be blown away."
" Take a seat because you're now a passenger in this thrill ride
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,10,"Jennifer Lawrence made this movie, her brilliant acting has come through once again. The way she personifies her character in this movie and it includes her others as well, makes you feel that she is actually that person and that the audience is drawn in to ride with her character throughout the whole film. When we talk about character development and acting, actors/actresses portray someone who is parallel to reality because the circumstances a movie presents to an audience are typically unrealistic. In some instances the characters are put into situations that are realistic to the ones we face in life, this movie carried with it some important meanings and posed philosophical questions to the audience about their own existence all done through the acting of Lawrence and Pratt. Together they worked as a team and combined with the amazing lighting of the set and camera work to show the audience true emotions that are rarely seen in Hollywood films. If there was one scene in the movie that stood out, it was the scene where Aurora found out that Jim had woken her up, this scene carried with it so much emotion that the audience is forced to choose who they support because up until this time, we favored Jim because he portrayed everything we don't want in life unhappiness and loneliness. I think it was crucially important for Aurora to be told by Arthur because then the character development does not happen to the extent that it does in the movie and instead you would have a boring 2-4 minute conversation between Jim and Aurora about why he woke her up and this would not develop our understanding of both their character motivations. In the end even though it may have been a typical Hollywood style ending, I felt satisfied that the price I paid to see this movie was definitely worth it so overall this movie deserves the 9 I am giving it because of the brilliant acting that combined with the lighting, camera work and editing to bring us a movie that I would recommend to anybody who is going to visit the cinema in the new year."
" J.Law & C.Pratt pulled a classic joke (on us)
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,3,"I was highly disappointed by this movie. Passengers was a movie with a lot of potential, but it ended up in a plot which even I could have written better. And I'm not a writer, neither have I a creative mind. Jim's character could have really been expanded into more detail. When Aurora said: ""We wouldn't have end up together in real life""; I couldn't agree more; Jim is such a bore. All the action parts of the movie were highly predictable and over exploited. It almost seemed like it was a cheap knock-off of Titanic. The acting skills of both of the lead actors were alright, same as usual. Visuals were okay. Music could've been better, and the end could've been more tragic. Even the predictability was predictable at the end.In the end, I don't regret seeing this movie, because I had such a laugh. AT IT."
" So Boring and Sexist and Bad, just BAD
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,1,"The script is terrible. I don't understand how this film was pitched and chosen to be made. It makes no sense on so many levels and even so it is supremely boring! JL doesn't come into the film until we have already endured what feel like a 90 year journey in just 45 minutes. AND when she does she is not that likable, she's a bore. And this film will put anyone into a life-suspension chamber. Save your money and/or time. Skip it. I wish I could say more about it but there are no words. How can you ask for 2 hours of your life back?! I feel like Jennifer Lawrence's character, and scream ""this is MURDER!"" And poor Lawrence Fishburne - he tried to save the movie, I mean the ship and just ends up dying like 5 minutes later. And how pathetic that Andy Garcia actually showed up on the set to just stand there and look at a green screen. He should fire his agent. Sony Films should fire the entire film department. Only Jennifer is laughing all the way to the bank with her 20 million dollars."
" Effective Space Travel and Love Story
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,9,"Morten Tyldum is one of the best up and coming director in my opinion and I thoroughly enjoyed his fine Norwegian crime thriller Headhunters (2011) and even more so his multi-Oscar nominated, including for best directing, The Imitation Game (2014) which may have been the best movie of that year. I was looking forward to this science-fiction project, a genre I like when it delivers on its promises, and the trailer even though it looked commercial, seemed promising. Unfortunately, it seems the critics picked the movie apart and I hesitated and doubted before seeing it, but decided that Tyldum was worth a try even with the naysayers. Firstly, Jon Spaihts'script is actually very good and shines on occasion with philosophical/psychological dilemmas and themes without losing the human factor and contact. We empathize with the characters and are afraid, lost, torn, and even in love (yes) with them. The technology, the setting, the context and the beautiful set (real and digital), including a stunning star swimming pool and luxury rooms on this passenger spaceship. One of the character is a writer and the words take on poetic and philosophical turns to trump and triviality or banality of more predictable or run-of-the-mill sci-fi films. Of course there is some plot turns that are a bit far- fetched but all in all it is well within its dangerous and wondrous world it delves into.Secondly, the directing makes the two leads make nuanced performance and illicit the right emotions from viewers while also keeping the oddness, awe, tension and adventurous factor.Lastly, this film is a timeless love story with secrets, sacrifices, choices and serendipity in an attempt to understand and live a potential eventual human migration to the stars and planets with its joys and perils. What do we do with the place and time you leave behind and what do you have to look forward to? To paraphrase the terrific and thoughtful screenplay, we are all just passengers in life... even if we want to be the captain of our lives. What is the meaning of time, life, love, loneliness? This raises great questions and leave you wanting more at the end.This is a great addition to Tylum's body of work and to science- fiction in general. Kudos and hope this will get more recognition in the future... hopefully not in 120 years like this fictional space travel..."
" The details were too far-fetched
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,5,"Where to start with this? This movie has a great story to it, but some of the details could have made for a better movie.It was a great concept in this movie; humanity finds a new planet to inhabit. But the only problem is it takes 120 years of traveling to get there. So in order to successfully get there, the people would need to be put in a deep sleep (hibernation) in individual pods. There was only a capacity of 5,000 people for each journey.But of course, something goes wrong to where Jim, played by Chris Pratt, was woken up 90 years too early. He had no way of going back into his hibernation, so he was left with two options- survival or suicide. It was cool to see him as he went about his day and what he would do. But it was too short lived. He was only alone for a little over a year before he decided to override the system to wake Aurora, played by Jennifer Lawrence. It seemed like way too short of a time frame for Jim to have already gone crazy.The main thing that did not make sense about this movie was the 120 year trip. For a trip that takes so long, why are we only able to send 5,000 people at a time? Also, there was a scene where Jim had tried to send a distress message to the people on Earth, but it would have taken 19 years for delivery and 55 years for a response, and it would cost over $6,000. Also, the passengers themselves did not make sense. Considering that there is a limit to each trip of 5,000 people and it takes 120 years to travel, the people that were being sent were middle class people. Jim was an engineer. Aurora was a journalist. For a voyage like this, I would have thought that it would have been for only the top 1/10 percentile of the top 1/10 percentile of the upper class on Earth. Who other can afford to pay over $6,000 for a single message?The ending was too short. Once Jim and Aurora find out why the ship was malfunctioning, it was a matter of about 10 minutes of the movie for it to be fixed. There was opportunity for a stronger finish here.Overall the movie's story was fine, but it could have been much more concrete. For a survival type movie, there could have been much more of a challenge presented to Jim and Aurora to make the story more thrilling."
" Everything is all good
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,6,"Passengers is a movie intended for all age groups. I think this movie is a better movie then Star Wars: Rogue One because there were obstacles that were problem solved and all recovered. There were major challenges and everything was overcome. I think this is one of the only movies I have seen in about 1 year, where everything comes together in a positive and good way. The movie is like V for Vendetta where a lot of the challenges seem to be cliché, but on the other hand - what is wrong with that? Living in a Western Hollywood Film culture - I have gotten used to clichés and at times they make me feel comfort at identifying them, viewing them and experiencing them. This movie is also very predictable, for example, the man wakes up a lady who he is the most attracted to physically and mentally to help him on his quest to save the spaceship. If each one of us, as humans could pick out our soul-mate by reading their life stories and then matching their beauty to the picture - our world would be like going into Walmart and picking up an item we ordered on-line; except in Walmart you can return the item if you are not satisfied, which was not the case with the lady whose pod he opened. Of course this movie is a sci-fi movie and not based on reality and there needs to be a disclosure on that - for example that love is based often on indescribable thoughts, feelings and emotions - versus a description and the physical appearance of someone."
" amazing story!
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,10,"very original script and though a love story that sounds familiar. Absolutely worth seeing it! amazing Jen as always ;-) beautiful as ever.The story makes u think about how u spent the time that has given to u and how can u make the best out of it. Especially some lines in the movie, nothing new but lines that remind u about what is important in life to worry about.The movie is very well from time perspective, no time in between to have a look at the watch.It is not sci-fi movie just like that, it is more: love story, survival, dealing with the life of others..."
" doesn't fulfil its promise
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,5,"The first half of this movie is excellent. It takes its time to place its co-protagonist Jim Preston at a point where he has to make a fascinating choice, and then plays through the consequences of that choice on his relationship with sister-protagonist Aurora Lane. The roles are played by two perfectly-cast actors, Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence, whose enjoyment in each others charms and talents is a delight to watch. They are joined by Michael Sheen for a number of gently comic scenes set in a bar that comes straight out of Kubrick's THE SHINING. Gradually the references to other movies start to accumulate. 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY, ALIEN, SILENT RUNNING and GRAVITY all make appearances. By the time it's done, the screenplay has lost whatever originality it had and turned into yet another piece of Hollywood sci-fi hackwork. What a pity.That aside, I was pleasantly surprised by Chris Pratt's range as an actor, as demonstrated in the first act of this movie. I hope he gets another chance to show the extent of his acting skills in a film that doesn't peter out."
" Excellent, but..
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,8,"Wow, this movie is beyond my expectations, after I watched some space movie like Gravity, Interstellar, The Martian, this caught my attention. Though the space was not that showed in the movie, I loved it. I just didn't expect the ending, I mean there is something I waited to happen like they just playing there for almost 90 years yet they didn't made a Baby. The ship has complete facilities and things for human survival so there is for sure a chance for a baby to survive there. And also how come there was a chicken and rabbits? at the end (Im assuming here that those fellas undergone hibernation too) but that's quite funny. And also why they only show the crews at the end, how about the other passengers, I don't think you will lose profit if you include some breathing passengers at the end :) There are only 4 casts in there anyway. Overall, I am impressed on how our technology improved this year, the settings was very realistic!"
" A synergetic mixture of platonic, yet troubled, love and vehement action
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,8,"I genuinely don't understand where all the hate is coming from. This is one of those movies in which most types of audiences will feel fulfilled after the session. It appeals to the romance craving fanatics due to the oscillating relationship lived by the couple. It also appeals to the sci-fi devotee's by exploring inter-galactic travel, the technology and mechanical gimmicks behind the functioning of the craft– and of course, for the skeptics, it is also reasonably scientifically correct! Of course, it supplies enough action-packed scenes to please the ""star wars"" type fans who require a constant supply of blood-rushing scenes to keep them on the edge of their couches. I, personally, wish I could tell you more about them, but where's the fun in that...I found the casting choice to be sterling as well! Pratt and Lawrence are able to accurately what are the feelings that I would expect to be emanating from both during a dire, intense situation as such. Overall, A LOT better than what I imagined, truly worth the watch"
" Not a Ten for one big reason
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,8,"Look, if you're a SciFi fan you have to suspend some belief. That's the rules. So the reviews that say this movie doesn't reflect reality are playing some weird double standard. I bet they loved Roque One or Star Trek, which are about as far fetched as you can go. Anyway, moving on... I loved the premise of this movie and appreciated the way the story line looked at some very human dilemmas around home, relationship, life and death. A lot of movies don't come close to the philosophical questions Passengers laid out, and the acting is superb. One big problem for me was the schmaltzy Hollywood ending. They took the ""return to life"" scene too far and THAT is where it lost any credibility. Then it skated to that Hollywood close that left a bit of vomit in my mouth. I can think of at least three endings that would have been more poignant and more in sync with the depth of the earlier messaging. Missed opportunity probably due to some suits that wanted more explosions and a Happy Ever After."
" Better than expected
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,8,"I was expecting, or rather fearing, another Jupiter Ascending when I saw who the two lead actors were, but this movie is more than just two hot celebrities teaming up for a cash-in. I have seen a trailer that sells this as an action movie, but people wanting space action will probably go home disappointed. This is more of an adventure drama, and thank goodness for that. The good part: This movie may not become a classic in the genre, but it does capture ones attention, with a good premise and beautiful space scenery in almost every scene. It gives a good sense of what it could be like to be isolated aboard a massive space ship cruising through the galaxy, with the scales of space contrasting our our tiny lives. The good special effects and scenery combined with the character ""Arthur"" carries this one home. Jennifer Lawrence does a decent job as well. The bad part: Im not a big fan of Criss Pratt's acting style as it does not fit this kind of movie very well. When ever he has a chance to add some depth and credibility to his character, it mostly ends up in some sort of silly (like in all his movies, which makes me wonder if he plays the same character in all of them?). The movie also has its share of corny Hollywood-esque jokes, but thankfully its kept on an almost acceptable level. The story of this movie could easily have been made into a thriller, or even a horror, but the aforementioned silly acting and cheesy jokes keeps the atmosphere jolly - but a bit too much so, and this is what drags it down.Overall, I think that Passengers is worth watching."
" Kyrgyzstan Kidnap In Space Cave
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,6,"In Kyrgyzstan, they have the not-so-delightful custom of kidnapping fiances to save on dowry money. The old caveman trope has heavy-jawed caveman in fur toga, club in hand, dragging cave-woman by the hair. Etc etc. This film is for me a loose remake of 1966 film 'The Trap' which has Oliver Reed as a fur trapper dragging wife hairwiseinto his Alaskan wilderness 'cave'. As per trope, she gets used to it and even becomes attached to him. Jennifer Lawrence seems like a pretty with-it modern woman. I'm wondering how she was persuaded to play this politically retrograde role. Did she think the developed world is free enough of the last thousands of years of female subjugation that this story won't be a representative example of same? You can't escape context, and this film's context screams 'made by cavemen to serve their agenda', unfortunately. I'm giving it two extra stars for the moderate degree of that specialised quality of wonder sci fi films bring. 4 extra stars for Michael Sheen, who is great as the resident android. Any that would have been given for entertainment value are cancelled out by political dodginess."
" A 120yr hibernation journey on the star ship Avalon to the colony planet Homestead II.
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,10,"The sci-fi action film Passengers was released December 21, 2016 and directed by Morten Tyldum. I say the film itself has a beautiful scenery, and excellent costume design. The theme of Passengers very well should be ""Do not worry to much about the future,"" ""and enjoy what is in front of you."" Often times we get caught up what we want to do, instead of what we can do at the moment. The overall content of the film was intriguing, surprising, and very heartwarming. I rally liked the chemistry between Jim Preston(Chris Pratt), Arthur(Michael Sheen), and Aurora Lane(Jennifer Lawrence). Both of them had an excellent portrayal of their characters thoughts, feelings, feelings, and actions from the beginning of the movie to the end. The context was pretty good too I thought. Especially, between Jim and Arthur when Jim explains his feelings to bartender to try to cope with his loneliness. There was not really anything that I did not like about Passengers at all. In closing, I say Passengers is a must see for ages thirteen and older. Just about everyone can get something out of seeing it."
" Passengers is a movie worth watching but don't expect an A+ masterpiece.
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,7,"The Movie started of very good. The first ""quarter"" of the film felt like The Martian and Chris Pratt showed some great acting skills. The combination of Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt worked very well throughout the movie.The setting (especially the beautiful design of the locations and the ship) made the Movie worth watching.The movies basic idea was brilliant. Passengers is not a space action adventure neither a romance all along, it's a mix of multiple Genres. Good acting, beautiful space scenes and a little laughter helped keeping a constant level of joy.The only thing I didn't liked about the film was the ending. The Ending was weaker than the beginning and a little bit over the top... However, Passengers is a movie worth watching."
" Fantastic movie - ignore the critics and watch in 3D
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,10,"Reluctantly I went to see this movie in 3D, usually, this makes me ill, and I never really saw the point - however the effects appear to have been improved to prevent this, and I felt it really benefited the movie.Despite the negative critic reviews I really enjoyed this movie. Chris Pratt's acting was very sensitive and well played - a departure from his normal acting style, similarly Jenifer Lawrence gave an unusually emotional and varied performance; once again a departure from her usual monosyllabic acting style.I think that the chemistry between the two actors was fantastic and although a sci-fi movie, the underlying story of being happy no matter where you are, as long as you have the right person was well portrayed. Both individuals unhappy with their lives back home on earth find love in unusual circumstances and make a utopia for themselves. Lots of reviews seem to focus on inconsistencies with the sci-fi angle, why would they send colonies on 200-year missions etc etc, most sci-fi films can have holes picked in the plots, it's just an easy medium to express a deeper story.anyway i loved this movie - watch it in 3D if you can"
" Original story, excellent actors, breathtaking visual effects - Better get your ticket soon!
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,10,"If you want to spend two hours of your life in an exciting yet mind- blowing atmosphere, this movie is definitely a way to go! This movie will definitely change the whole picture you get when someone mentions Sci-Fi movies. While setting plot in the outer space, far away from home, the movie doesn't necessarily deal completely with extraterrestrial things, rather it deals with person's inner conflicts and questions of one's ability to live independently, far away from any traces of human civilization.While having breathtaking visual effects and amazing plot with just enough action, the movie is also very sentimental and emotional. There are scenes which will bring tears to your face, both sad and happy tears. In any case, this movie doesn't disappoint when it comes to emotions. However, this is not to say that the whole movie is focused on a romance between two people. There is a lot of action and tension that you will often forget about it, after which you will be rewarded with few emotional scenes.Special praise goes to tension-building heart-racing moments and wonderful cast. Jennifer Lawrence showed us who's the boss when it comes to actresses.All in all, definitely a movie to see. At least twice."
" Beautifully shot, well made, extremely engrossing - surely a contender for Best Production Design?
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,7,"Passengers - another film that in my view seems to be getting a bit of an unfair kicking from the press, so I am pleased to see many others like myself agree this is a great film. It certainly deserves to be, stuck as it has been in development hell for several years with different actors and directors coming and going.Its the future (You know, the place you want to live in yourself one day, but sadly ain't going to be around for...) and we're on board the Starship Avalon, a vessel owned by the Homestead Corporation who makes billions of dollars transporting Colonists to new worlds (Don't tell Trump it will give him ideas) around the galaxy and plan do so with the 5000 colonists on board here. The ship is automated and everyone is in hyper sleep including the crew. (A bit like flying on Ryan Air) Everyone will only awaken when the ship is one month out from the destination but unfortunately a large asteroid storm does some damage to the vessel and a pod activates early belonging to young Jim Peston (Pratt, probably his best performance yet) a lowly mechanic who can only access the cheap meals option at the breakfast canteen and has the low budget accommodations (Air BnB) options on board. When Jim realises he has woken 90 years early and cannot wake any other crew who are behind a security sealed door he knows he will die on the ship alone. A year passes before he considers an alternative way of living. His only other company is a bar serving agreeable talking Android called Arthur (Michael Sheen on perfect form as always) In time Jim comes to know the biographies of his fellow passengers and one in particular, a writer not uneasy on the eye, Aurora (Lawrence) gets his attention. Jim learns everything about her from her own diaries and discovers she plans to write a book about her journey to the new world. Jim soon learns he has the ability to wake other passengers up and is faced with a dilemma, wake the girl of his dreams so he is not cosigned to his fate alone or die lonely in space before ever reaching his destination. I guess he could have searched for someone with really good computer skills so he could find the code for that door and wake up the crew, but sadly this thought escapes him or perhaps the new world has no computers?Passengers had me gripped from the word go, from its sleek production design to Pratt's restrained but charming performance there was much to enjoy here. The ship and the dilemma facing Jim seemed all too believable. It felt as though this was the sort of thing one could experience while trying to correct your mobile phone provider and eventually your forced to make a difficult decision. It would not be the first time in history man kind had paid for the choice of cost effectiveness over safety simply because nothing had gone wrong in the past (Like no staff in your cinema screen to tell that bloody girl to get off her mobile phone) but this aside it is the crux of the morale dilemma that faced Jim Preston that really made the film great. I found myself asking how would I deal with the same situation? This is what Passengers asks of you. Jennifer Lawrence is on fine form in the film as well in the role of Aurora and Sheen adds an appropriate level of humour in his role as the dumb waiter of the piece but it is Chris Pratt who really stole the film for me. An actor normally associated with comical quips and nods to camera for Parks and Recreation he really shows his emotional depths and range here.As the characters deal with the additional problems facing them, other dilemmas present themselves and again I found myself asking the same questions as were asked of the characters as the story progressed. This is a sure sign of both clever writing and film making. Another mention must also go to the outstanding production design. Certainly there is some use of CGI here, but the sets and the CGI design of the star ship are simply incredible and blend perfectly together. The Avalon felt like a real ship that must be out there somewhere. Everything seemed so real and the space walk scenes were as dramatically tense as one would expect the real thing to be.I really enjoyed this film and as others have stated it is suitable for those of all ages though the younger children may find it a little wanting due to lack of action but I was rarely if ever bored. Lawrence Fishburne has a nice cameo in the film, but to explain who or how would be to give a spoiler away. I thought this film would benefit too from being seen on the big screen and I was right. The vastness of the empty locations of the ghostly star ship are very much enhanced by the cinema experience. My compliments to the whole team on this production. The price tag for the film seemed a little on the high side but it certainly looks the part and the cast gave it there all (So they should for 50K a minute)Recommended."
" Guilt Trip
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,6,"""Passengers"" is not a film that you can really talk about in much depth without straying into spoiler territory: so this is the shortened non- spoiler version. (If you have seen the film and want the fuller discussion of the contentious points, go to bob-the-movie-man.com). , so The backdrop for ""Passengers"" is the spaceship ""Avalon"", on a 120 year trip taking Earth colonists to the new world of ""Homestead 2"". Following an 'incident' the story finds two individuals – Jim Preston, played by Chris ""Jurassic World"" Pratt, and Jennifer ""Joy"" Lawrence – as the only passengers awake on the automated ship among 5000+ other slumbering souls. It rather goes without saying that with two attractive and bankable Hollywood stars and nothing else to do, the two 'get it on'. With things on the ship going from bad to worse, the two must work as a team to try to save the ship, crew and fellow passengers from disaster.As a fan of sci-fi, I'll start with a positive that the Avalon is a gloriously rendered spacecraft, and many of the scenes of space walking present beautiful cinematography (by Rodrigo Prieto of ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and ""Argo""). Many of the other special effects in the film – led by special effects supervisor Daniel Sudick, of the Marvel franchise – are spectacularly good, especially one which demonstrates why the lifeguards closed the pool on the International Space Station! The overall premise of the film is also original and well-conceived, setting up the backdrop for some serious post-watch ethical debate (see the spoiler section on bob-the-movie-man.com).Where the wheels came off for me though is with the script by Jon Spaihts (""Prometheus"", ""Doctor Strange""). Some of the dialogue is just appallingly trite, and some of the supposed capabilities of our hero, Preston, are laughable. For example, he possesses an uncanny ability as ""an engineer"" to open a cabinet of electronics, scan the circuits and say ""Nope – that all looks fine"": the next time my washing machine controller packs in, he's going to be on my speed-dial for sure! And (cue trite line – ""every component on the ship has a spare"") Preston immediately finds the required part (curiously, it's right next to the failing component and not in Bay 67 on cargo deck 327!) and knows how to plug and play it as required.But, for me, there was one particularly dire point in the script where Spaihts obviously forgets which film he's writing the scene for and 'goes superhero': oh, hang on, Preston doesn't HAVE any superhero powers! For me, any goodwill the story had built up through to that point get vented into space. The director is Morten Tyldum, whose ""Headhunters"" I really enjoyed but who is probably more famous for ""The Imitation Game"". Not overawed by the production's scale, he does a great job of getting good performances out of the rather wooden action hunk that is Chris Pratt and the reliable Oscar-winner Jennifer Lawrence who (apart from one dramatic and emotional scene) the script doesn't really stretch. Michael Sheen is also a great watch as the witty and dry android bar-tender.In summary, this was a nice premise with great special effects and gorgeous production design, but frustratingly let down with a weak screenplay. With a better script and another 10% of tweaking, this could have been a real sci-fi classic."
" The movie has several plot holes, but still enjoyable
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,7,"I enjoy the whole movie and don't feel bored at all, so I'd say it was a good experience, although some questions struck me while watching the movies. nevertheless, this is a good movie overall.SPOILER:There is no way there is no manual override for such critical procedure (hibernation). Also, no redundancy system, say, for burned chip? they should create a better plot. 5000 passengers, 258 crews, 1 autodoc. really? so when they all awake 4 months prior landing, it would be a disaster. i have more questions but those are the ones that struggled me the most."
" In between snack and different than suggested in the trailer
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,6,"I liked the movie, but that was because I knew I shouldn't expect a sci-fi story, but more a simple romance. With good looking people and a good looking spaceship and action. It is an attractive looking and tasting snack, for in between.Sort of Spoiler alert: The last line in the trailer however suggests something else: He says ""There is something I have to tell you. There is a reason that we woke up early"" In the movie he says ""There is something I have to SHOW you."" And the last line is never said in the movie, and the first line was connected to something else. Those two fake lines together suggested for me another more complex or exciting plot than it actually is. A real movie-watch-bait trick. Intentionally. Maybe that's why the movie disappointing for a lot of people, as they were suggested to believe there was more."
" ""Passengers"" Is Diminished By Misguided Attempts of Jon Spaihts
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,7,"Worthy of the third place among the best unproduced scripts in Hollywood (Black List); nine years ago (2007), ""Passengers"" sign was just a basic preliminary version predisposing to find a studio to financing its making with $35 million initial cost and possibly starring multi-nominated Keanu Reeves and Emily Blunt. Eventually, Sony Pictures got IP rights and fortunately signed Morten Tyldum up in the direction to materialize it with $110 million extraordinary production budget with the fabulous signing of Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence as leaders of the ambitious project. Today, they present us an already assembled film, aesthetically superb, with unimaginable argumentative potentials and a harmonious chemistry between its main leads, however, its biggest point break is specifically in the screenplay, which diverges tirelessly from that original version established it among the best unrealized projects.In the adjacent future, mankind is able to emigrate from overpopulated and ruined Earth for leaving and seek for habitable spaces abroad. The starship Avalon is transporting 5,000 passengers and over 200 crew members in a cryogenic sleep for a journey that takes 120 years in order to arrive in Homestead II, the new planet Earth. Although everything seems to indicate that the cyclopean experiment will be satisfactory, the spaceship collides hardly against a meteorite, which stirs up the breakdown of one sleep chamber, Jim Paterson's, our protagonist. Each person in the ship has a unique and substantial occupation around the population of the new colony: doctors, microbiologists, nurses, machinists, law specialists, etc. Jim is a young mechanical engineer, who quickly becomes aware that he has awakened 90 years early the official advent, contemplating ethical and moral dilemmas as intrinsic as outer space where the story runs. After one year of being in a techno-transitory paradise, he finally concludes to awaken to one traveler and keeping in mind that it would practically be to immolate her, male protagonist's elections are deeply objectionable. The sudden new member of the spaceship is named Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence), a writer from New York who aims to write a book about her personal experience in the new world and return to the planet Earth with the most amazing story. Nevertheless, failure accumulation of the huge ship and different narrative confidences push them to the edge of space, literally.The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is incredibly absorbent, it's imposing accompanied by dazzling production design, where prevails snowy and dreary tones which divinely adapt to prelude in order to connect with main character's isolation. As it progresses, induced the arrival of the new human being attracts slightly more grace with immaculate pools, high-quality restaurants and a journey as cynical as captivating around the selfsame outer space. Moreover, visual effects are at the height of many Hollywood products, it's equivalent and even superior to some of the most outstanding sci-fi works in recent times. Some twists in the script allow for acclaiming it spectacularly, such as the scenes of gravity loss, the final stretch or external shots of the Avalon flowing by the great Milky Way, wonderful. The key new technologies for the development of the story are visually provocative and somewhat so realistic that make us aspire one gold class breakfast through our bracelet.The film's cardinal mission is spectators must put oneself in Jim's shoes, it suggests them convoluted dilemmas of the character and deleterious corollaries drive by the silence demon. Chris Patt's charisma in the first few minutes as survivor into a technological spaceship is enough to keep it afloat, he wanders naked with a— superfluously—long beard, formulating himself moral matters such as suicide, a death foretold and unbearable solitude. Although many people didn't realize, The decision of Jim must be worthy of debate and more worthy must be its subsequent actions. In the middle of the film, when love starts to flow between lovers, Stockholm syndrome is patent and the protagonist can be stealthily described as a harasser. However, this scene is covered with Tyldum's direction, who focused on other banalities.With the arrival of Aurora, the fascinating concepts raised in the first hour of the sci-fi movie take their place at the end of the list, since it opts for conceiving a bland affair, a romance as sporadic as tedious. Go from there, the movie breaks down and loses the land he was harvested beside ""Gravity"", ""Interstellar"" or the more recent ""Arrival"". Although it works excellently as a romantic film, it is the third act which affects decisively its prestige. Its unsatisfactory ending, although we haven't lately seen a drastic end in commercial cinema, it wasn't the most pertinent for concluding this futuristic story which began by clouds and terminated with fewer forces. Even though, it isn't a blunder of the acclaimed director who had to stick to the default settings of the story, story re-written by Jon Spaihts, who deplorably decided to distance from the original ending.Frustrating, a missed opportunity. For those who attend to a movie theater without having depths and inconsistencies in mind, ""Passengers"" is the favorite candy for mass audiences. For us who inherently love films and we're as severe as objectives, ""Passengers"" is an irregular movie, but essentially spoiled. This one is a true sign that the nature of the seventh art is to narrate a story, a tightly structured story, not mere visual beauty. With a first part which puts in manifest our deepest human questions; the exciting and controversial issues are imperceptibly mitigated into a surplus drama-romance and a typical Hollywood final sequence, which could be circumstantially sublime hugging the original one. It makes us think that it's another corporate product, but inside us, we know that Sony dropped a film which be aiming for the top between its hands."
" Passengers - excellent start but final act spoils it
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,6,"Jim is a technical engineer aboard the spaceship Avalon, which is on its way to colony planet Homestead II. A journey that will take roughly 120 years. About 30 years in, Jim wakes up from his hibernation, due to a technical failure. With 90 years to go, and no way to get back into hibernation, Jim is condemned to spend the remainder of his life alone, traveling, but never arriving. Depressed Jim discovers a fellow passenger, the beautiful Aurora, who is an inspired writer and journalist. Jim falls in love and decides to wake her up. From here on, many more things go wrong with the ship and Jim and Aurora must find a way to rescue themselves and the 5,000 other passengers aboard the Avalon, while juggling their own unfortunate fate.Going into this movie, I was somewhat on the fence, because I had high hopes for it, but the reviews were pretty terrible. Having seen the movie, I can understand why the reviews are so bad, but I am glad to report the movie isn't as bad as the experts make us believe. There is just one very big issue that's hard to overcome. But I will get to that in a minute.First the good stuff. The movie starts out really well. It contains critique on the over-commercializing that's been taking over nearly everything (in the movie even space travel). Ironic, really, coming from a big budget Hollywood flick, but interesting nonetheless. Jim's tough decision whether to wake up Aurora, condemning her to the same fate as his, or leaving her in hibernation and facing loneliness for the rest of his days was also well done. Pratt does well to show the emotional depth of the character (much to my surprise, because apart from being funny, Pratt's acting had never been all that impressive). He can't compete with Lawrence, though. She dominates every scene she's in. Sheen plays the android Arthur very well, too. Finally, as you would expect from a movie with such a large budget, the visuals are absolutely stunning.So far, so good, I thought, but towards the end, the movie makers unfortunately decided that fast pacing was more important than emotional investment. The last third of the movie felt very rushed, and I just wasn't as invested when the finale came along. The decisions of the characters made little sense because they weren't foreshadowed well enough, and the parts that should have made me go wild actually didn't feel all that exciting anymore. This is sad, since they had done so well to take their time in the first bit of the movie, and then somehow forgot how important that was later on. Basically, they took a good idea, started out well, and then messed it up by going all Hollywood in the end. Oops.Should you watch it? If you like Hollywood-boom-boom turbo flicks, then no. The first bit is quite slow and character-driven. If you like Sci-Fi and don't mind slower movies, then yes, but do keep in mind the ending will not be as good as you want it to be. Just enjoy the first and second act, and of course the visuals. And Jennifer Lawrence is good. Very good.Verdict: 6.0 - Could have been great, but a rushed Hollywood ending spoils the experience."
" A worthwhile experience for movie lovers
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,8,"I went to see the movie with a rather low expectation, thinking that this might as well be another over-hyped Hollywood blockbuster movie. Turns out, The Passengers was nothing as I hoped, thankfully, and I had an delightful time watching it.The movie took place in a sci-fi, futuristic settings. But it is drama- orientated and focused more on the chemistry between the two protagonists, Jim and Aurora. This direction of story-telling has enabled Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt to have an adequate room to demonstrate exceptionally their emotional roller-coasters. The pacing of the movie is well-orchestrated, slow but not staggering; the cinematography is immersive and compelling. Though some plot points are put in a seemingly too comfortable way for the sake of untying the knot of the scripts and the movie is overall somewhat formulaic, you will enjoy the movie given that you see it with a mindset of a person who just want to be entertained.Is this the best movie of this year so far? Probably not. But it is a great one to start a year of promising movies to come."
" Creepy and shallow sci-fi romance
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,3,Passengers suffers from poor plotting and a creepy storyline that offers a lackluster redemption of the male lead. It feels rushed and not deserved and makes the movies have a strange message that leaves viewers feeling weird at the end. The movie relied on its two stars to make it succeed at the box office but bad reviews and tough competition kept if from being a breakout success.The story is about Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) who wakes up on a spaceship due to a malfunctioning sleeping pod and finds himself stranded by himself with 90 years still to go on his journey. The movie doesn't do a great job of making it clear that Jim is alone and desperate for company. He tries a few things for entertainment including talking to the robotic bartender Arthur (Michael Sheen) but gives up and starts obsessing over another sleeping passenger.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com
" A good movie to see in the theatres.
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,6,"Now having agreed to go see this on Christmas instead of collateral beauty which would have been my choice this film definitely did not disappoint . It's not easy making a movie with just one or two characters for pretty much the entire film but they definitely did a good job with this one . It takes place on a flight to a new planet that will take 90 years to get there, all the passengers are in a chamber that will preserve them for the duration of the 90 year flight. The problem is there is a malfunction and some of the chambers open, leaving Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence awake and alone 90 years early. This is one of those rooms where the less you know the better so as to not do too much away let's just say they have to figure out how they're going to survive For 90 years all by themselves, Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawerence both give good performances that make her feel very enjoyable definitely a movie to check out in the theaters"
" Trailer was better than the movie
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,4,"I'm sad that my first review is about a movie that almost made me left the cinema room, but i had to write something. The acting is not bad, nor are the visuals or the special effects. The thing this film is missing is a good plot.I feel that it had all the right ingredients but the final product was not good at all.Also, the trailer makes the viewer believe that the movie is about the situation, about the spaceship and some unknown mystery and guess what? The trailer has nothing to do with the reality of the movie. It's sad but that's how I left the cinema thinking. The soundtrack doesn't help either.Maybe I was looking for something similar to Interstellar or a tiny influence from Space Odissey, maybe I was wrong to expect those things, but If you're thinking like me, don't buy that cinema ticket!"
" A moral problem beautifully presented and executed.
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed Passengers a lot. It's not perfect though. The spaceship is beautiful from both the outside and the inside, and you get the impression that future technology is really fantastic. The computer systems are pretty dumb though (including Michael Sheen's android). This is all forgivable though, because if the computers weren't dumb the story wouldn't work.The only part of the film that doesn't really work is the bit in the middle with Laurence Fishburne. I could see three reasons why his character was needed, but it all felt very contrived. He has one important line though, so I can forgive it (just about). I just wish the writers had thought about that part a bit more, as the rest of the film was really great. Chris Pratt, Jennifer Lawrence and Michael Sheen were brilliant too.Passengers is clever, thoughtful, science fiction, and I would highly recommend it."
" Great Sci-Fi space travel flick (FYI: Sony mucks up the IMDb intro)
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,10,"Skip the Sony one sentence intro which Sony managed to screw up. The IMDb 'Storyline' got it right.The story revolves around a malfunction in a sleep chamber that awakens one passenger. Suffice to say 'things' happen as the space tale goes on its merry way.Cinematography and special effects, tops. This was especially true of the swimming pool/gravity scene. Great space romance and super chemistry between the lead actors. The bartender/robot adds good comic relief. The script is top notch with suspense and great action sequences in the last 1/3 of the filmFrom first to very last scenes this film delivers. Its 7.1 rating is well deserved. One of the best all around Sci-Fi films I have seen in quite a while."
" The economics of space colonization . . .
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,9,". . .are touted once again in PASSENGERS, as they were a few years back during AVATAR. Jennifer Lawrence, as journalist ""Aurora Lane,"" estimates during PASSENGERS that America's first colonized planet boosted our Gross National Product (GNP) by $8 quadrillion (that is, by about 8,000,000,000,000,000 bucks), which is more than enough to upgrade our nuclear weapons arsenal while also fully funding ObamaCare, not to mention fixing our infrastructure by replacing every lead water pipe with gold and repaving every mile of our Interstate Highways with Titanium. As a side benefit, most of these New Earths Colonists will be bored Rich People, according to PASSENGERS. Just think how much better off America will be when the sort of billionaire bozos making up White House Resident-Elect Rump's Cabinet are instead put into ""Hibernation"" for 249 of the next 250 years, so that they can spend the remaining 12 months touring a Planet Far Far Away. By the time that these Fat Cat One Per Centers return here from the Great Beyond, they'll be someone else's Problem."
" A great movie about life choices and moral dilemmas
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,8,"Critics are bashing this movie because apparently they did not understand the purpose of this movie. THIS IS NOT SCI-FI. If you're expecting a SCI-FI movie, or something similar to ""Gravity"", forget it. THIS IS NOT SCI-FI. This is not a movie about the adventure of being in spaceActually, this is a PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER/DRAMA that happens in space. And for being a psychological thriller, it's actually a wonderful movie. If you happened to enjoy ""Moon"" featuring Sam Rockwell, you'll definitely like this one. Jennifer Lawrence's performances usually annoy me a little for being a little prepotent, but in ""Passengers"" she brings a leap of fresh air with her natural, unpretentious acting. You can see she matured a lot and her acting has improved by leaps and bounds, and she's no longer annoying like she used to be, she's growing into a great actress right now. I was also very positively surprised by Chris Pratt's performance. I have always seen the potential he had to be a great actor apart from being mostly a action movie stud. But in this movie, his acting skills are shown, and they don't disappoint. His emotions are natural and visceral, his acting is mature and convincing, and, in my opinion, deserves an Academy Award nomination. You can see he clearly worked very hard to play this character, and he deserves recognition for that. Unfortunately, I think this movie will be ignored by the Academy, since the Academy follows a lot the rules of the critics. The cinematography of the movie is superb, with beautiful love scenes between Lawrence and Pratt. Also, Michael Sheen and Laurence Fishburne surprises with their adorable, great, essential cameos, like cherries on the top of a sundae. This is not a light-hearted movie, or an action movie about life in space. This is a movie about moral dilemmas, life choices, loving and being loved, and, most of all, forgiveness. The ending, which was actually unexpected in a way, made me smile and pity the characters a little at the same time, for being so innocent, such dreamers. This is a beautiful movie, that goes deep into our emotions, and if you have ever had a dream or loved someone, you'll understand its deepness and meaning."
" Disappointing
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,2,"I'm not really sure who is the target audience of this film. With so many significant plot holes it just doesn't work as a sci-fi movie, and as a love story with the dark element it doesn't spend enough time on it.Overall, I just couldn't get past the huge plot holes. I wonder what the filmmakers thought process is when they introduce them? ***Spoiler alert***For example, the ship experiences critical malfunctions yet there is no emergency procedure to wake up the crew!? Or the fact that the guy can run up a 6000 dollar bill with a message to Earth, have unlimited meals and drinks in the restaurant and the bar, go space walking any time he likes and enter cargo hold where all the spare parts are located, yet he can't get the coffee he would like for breakfast (this is an absurdly small plot hole, but it really reflects the whole movie)!? The film's idea is an interesting one, but very poorly executed."
" decent movie
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,7,"Passengers is an art-house science fiction movie that somehow got made by a major studio with A-list stars. Passengers isn't scared to go into dark territory, as a choice made by the main character could be deemed morally dubious. However, as questionable as his actions may be, they are totally human and are handled with tact by the director. The movie's failings are concentrated in its final act when contrivances turn Passengers into a less compelling experience than what it starts out as. The action transpires sometime in the distant future. No date is given but, given the level of technology, it is closer to Star Trek than modern day."
" A poorly-made spacebound blockbuster
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,5,"From the beginning, I had low expectations of Passengers due to the swath of bad reviews emanated from multiple sources. However, I did find that the film excelled past this barrier only to find a steep cliff of mediocrity that it dove off near the middle of the movie. Featuring an all-star cast of Chris Pratt, J.Law, and Laurence Fishburne, here I will be delving into my thoughts about the new sci-fi film Passengers. On the 5,000 person-keeping ship the Avalon, Chris Pratt or ""Jim Preston"" finds himself awake 90 years earlier than the scheduled de-hibernation as the ship travels toward a new inhabitable planet. Within minutes, he finds that he is the only woke passenger on board. Shortly, Preston finds himself enjoying the luxuries of the ship having gotten past his anguish about the malfunction. However, he succumbs to loneliness quickly, as a robotic bartender and roombas that vacuum cheerios are unable to keep a man company. A big problem I had with the following moments of the movie was the complete and utter obstruction of a major plot point from the trailers released. Preston finds himself wandering the pod bay when he spots a beautiful young women in one of the hibernation pods. As a matter of fact, Jennifer Lawrence or ""Aurora Lane"" was woken by Preston, unlike how the plot had initially told she woke up at the same time as him. This sort of detail maneuver was only another sly way for Columbia Pictures to break into the box office. As the story progresses, not only does the plot lull, but it finds a cliché-y feel that was not present in the beginning. The main issue with Passengers is its inability to find real substance. When the main characters learn the ship is soon going to self implode, they are instantly knowledgeable of how to fix the problem. This takes essence in Chris Pratt, whose character's mechanical abilities seem to be that of superhuman. Well into the film, I lost most of my feelings for the characters due to the lack of honest development and interest. The romance between Preston and Lane ascends painstakingly quick and dissolves just as fast. Most of this was due to the completely deadbeat pace of the film, which surely progresses ""slowly and steadily"" but often suddenly escalates due to something needed to be accomplished. One thing that was to the benefit of the plot, however, were the astounding visual effects and cinematography, which are very well done by the studios at hand. There are gleaming shots of space, and brilliant CGI of the Avalon progressing through the void. Towards the end of the film, there are many turns which some would say are in the wrong direction. At points, the grandeur of the issues at hand are laughable in the way they are portrayed. Overall, Passengers combines many awkward cliché notions with a sloppy plot to become a lackluster sci-fi film for the end of the year. 5/10"
" Better than I expected.
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,7,"A somewhat underrated movie at the moment. In my opinion it offers great acting, spectacular CGI settings and costume, while the plot and some of the characters' decisions are it's greatest weaknesses. Ethical themes ranging from the corporate dictatorship the ship might represent, selfishness, self sacrifice, personal power and forgiveness are dealt with to varying degrees. I found it interesting to see some of the likely complications of privatized space travel touched on. Consumer rights facilitating class divisions (re food). Intellectual property rights (re hibernation tech). A lack of safety measures based on marketing claims of infallibility."
" Flawed chick flick in space
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,3,"Saw the trailer and assumed this would be science fiction. Don't make the same mistake - this is 'stalker' territory masquerading as romance.The visuals are stunning, and set designers would score a 10, as would the effects department. The film's full of plot holes, but let's start with the distasteful aspect first. Jim Preston's suspended animation pod malfunctions and wakes him up 90 years early. In a ship of several thousand sleepers and a few hundred crew, he's left to walk the ship alone for over a year.During this time he hatches the plot of waking up a fellow passenger, who he's picked. He reads up on her, essentially profiling her.Despite (or in spite of) knowing it will ruin her life, and condemn her to the same miserable existence, he goes ahead and wakes her up.As many others have said, this could have worked as a much darker film, where she gets revenge etc. What we get is a sappy romance story where she hates him after finding out the truth, then decides she loves him and sacrifices her future to be with him.The film left a nasty after taste for me, as it was essentially a stalker type film, where the victim forms an emotional attachment with her 'captor' - 'Stockholm Syndrome'.This is evidenced when she could have gone back into suspended animation, but chose to stay with the man who trashed her dreams.Again, this could have worked if it had been far darker, exploring the human psyche. What we get is sugary coated romance.Anyway, some obvious plot holes.1) The ship's built on the premise that nothing will ever go wrong. This despite the film showing spare parts for every aspect of the ship later. Yet there's no facility to awaken the crew, or even having an android repair crew (despite there being service androids in abundance elsewhere).2) It's impossible (apparentally) to go back into suspended animation once you're awake. Yet much later in the film, it shows it's possible to be put into suspended animation in the medical department. Why do the pods not have the same facility ?3) Why was the bartender shown as human like, yet the waiters and breakfast dispensers are just machines ? 4) How did he survive a massive venting at the end ? Okay he technically died in space, but was bought back with some very dodgy procedures.5) What would planting trees and vegetation do to delicate electronics ? Looks like a jungle at the end of the film.Overall a massive letdown, with the message seeming to be if you're 'hot' you can get away with anything."
" Both Sci-fi and Romance Clichés
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,6,"I guess this is one of those films that a guy would see because it is set in space and a girl would see because of the romance. Okay, maybe I am being a little stereo-typical, but this is one of those films that seems to be trying to appeal to two types of audiences. Mind you, I would be much more inclined to see a film like Passengers as opposed to La La Land, but then again I suspect that there are a lot of women out there that are more included to see La La Land as opposed to Passengers, but once again I am just speculating.The film is about a colony ship that is spending 120 years traveling from Earth to a new colony, and everybody on the ship is asleep. About a third of the way there the ship hits a massive asteroid belt and causes some systems to malfunction. At about the same time one of the passengers awakes thinking that he is almost there only to discover that he still has 90 years to go. The problem is that he cannot get back to sleep. This is were temptation arises as he can't access the crew quarters, and thus is left alone with a bartender robot, so he decides to wake a rather attractive woman up as well. Everything turns out okay until she discovers that he woke her up on purpose, and all the while the ship's systems are continuing to malfunction (and without access to the crew's quarters there is no way they can find out what the actual problem is).In a way this film is pretty predictable – it is a romance anyway so it works on the principle of boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy does something heroic and they fall in love forever. Okay, one can suggest that by waking her up he did actually save the entire ship, and I suspect that she eventually realises that. However, being stuck alone on a ship for the rest of your life may seem great, but it would push human tolerance to the absolute limit. The other thing is that while they are trying to be scientifically accurate, one does wonder what exactly exists at the end of the rainbow – we are speaking of some incredibly vast distances here, and with the rate at which history moves, by the time they arrive everything and everybody they know will be long gone.The other thing is that nobody actually knows first of all if the planet is inhabitable (it would take years to get a scout ship there and then years to get any information back, if the scout ship actually arrives). However, in the end what we have is more of a science-fiction romance than anything really serious, and the practicalities of such a trek is probably not meant to get in the way. However, I simply cannot help but think that this whole process is little more than a massive con by a corporation to milk millions of dollars out of unsuspecting individuals (and the crew are basically a bunch of convicts that are placed in there to give the illusion of a legitimate enterprise)."
" Memorable Scifi Love Story
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,9,"This is perhaps one of the most memorable scifi love story ever made. I mean it really. It's so great that it should rival The Titanic. I just don't understand why people would say it otherwise.From the scifi aspect, it is super fantastic. Every technology available on the ship was in fact real science and nothing science fiction about it. Especially if we look at what humans can achieve today. Well except for the artificial gravity technology. I just think that artificial gravity is too far fetch and it will remain science fiction for centuries to come. The only possible artificial gravity that is not science fiction, is a gravity caused by centrifugal force, just like in ""The Martian"" movie or ""Elysium"" movie. The ships overall design is artistic, very cool, and unique. If there are people who despise the ship's design, then they are people who won't accept the perfect harmony of technology and art.The other technology used, like holograms, electronic glass, automated robots, and advance AI, are also real science. There are no fiction about them. The fact that the ship carries all spare parts with it is also a brilliant idea and will actually be a common sense. I mean why not? With decades to travel, surely, something will go wrong. Thus spare parts will be deemed necessary for long voyage across the galaxy.Well, enough said about the scifi aspect. Let's start about the love story.Jennifer Lawrence is a perfect actress for this movie. She's hot and pretty. She's able to act seriously at some scenes. She's able to show signs of frustration, hatred, anger, hopelessness, and sadness all at once. I mean she's just perfect for that character.On the other hand, the male counterpart is not as amazing as she was. The studio should have chosen another actor, because he just doesn't seem to fit in the overall movie. He can't show the perfect emotion as he should have in many scenes. Tom Cruise would probably give more in-depth personality for that character. This is a flaw that the studio made.The love story itself is rather alluring. Motivated by loneliness, a male will seek out his counterpart to be his spouse. This is the perfect analogy to every human being in this world. The female character then show up and slowly fell in love with the male character. At first, many people would think of it as cheesy. But actually, it made perfect sense. As the only couple in the ship with nothing else to do for decades to come, they might as well hook up and make babies. It's not cheesy, it's perfect logical sense.Despite all of that, they should have changed the ending scene. Seeing a huge tree and plants growing all over the ship was just terrible. It doesn't fit the expected emotion.The studio could have made the male character permanently die. It'll leave a perfect romantic scar within the audiences heart. Just like the Titanic movie. Such condition, will make this movie memorable. But if the studio want to make a happy ending, then it is more suitable to show the descendants of the main characters. Well, either way, the ending scene ruined the entire romantic emotion that all audience had."
" Curious levels of hate for this reasonable romance
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,7,"Most of the anger seems to be about the moral dilemma that Chris Pratt's character faces and his response to it. Clearly many of the critics feel he made a bad choice. However they seem to be glossing over the fact that he knows what he's doing is wrong (he even has an expository chat with the robot barman to ensure we all get the implications). He's already tried, and failed, to kill himself at this point so it's not like he's acting on a whim and his self loathing is evident. The fact that Jennifer Lawrence's character finds a way to forgive him is crime is held up as a 'message' from the filmmakers that stalking is OK cos she'll come around in the end. Really? Leaving aside that 'stalking' is hardly the right term for such an extreme scenario she has the opportunity to kill him - which he knowingly gives her - and chooses not to take it - facing effectively the same dilemma as Pratt's character faced and coming to a similar realisation - the alternative to this extreme choice is suicide. (If she chose hibernation at the end of the film she knows he will kill himself) She chooses compassion. I've read here someone claiming the robot bartender 'sold him out' No he didn't. In the dialogue he is told that the two characters 'have no secrets from each other' and he - being a robot - believes them. (See the collected works of Issac Asimov for full details) There are problems with this film - the resurrection and convenient death of a crew member seems only to occur to get past a plot obstacle -and yes the usual Hollywood requirement is that the leads are both impossibly good looking - but the visuals are impressive and the cast do a good job. The more I reflect on the film the more I like it."
" Walt's 100 Words
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,7,"Just to be clear the Iggy Pop song does not appear in the soundtrack to this movie. ""Passengers"" is a space romance with some amazing drama. Congrats to Director Morten Tydlum on the creation of the spaceship, Avalon. This is a luxury cruise ship that shares DNA with ""Poseidon"" and ""Titanic"". The plan to colonise a distant planet goes horribly wrong when the starship malfunctions. Why did it take so long to hook up for Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence lost in space? Highlight: Spacewalks and Swimming Pool scenes. Look out for: Android Michael Sheen, a dying Laurence Fishburne and Andy Garcia as the Starships Captain."
" ""Titanic"" In Space
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,5,"The adventurous science fiction romance ""Passengers,"" starring Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt, contains an initially appetizing premise. An enormous spaceship carrying 5000 passengers and a crew of 250, all of whom are asleep in hibernation pods for the 120-year journey through space to colonize another Earth-like planet, encounters complications with an asteroid field and a malfunction opens one of the pods. Our unfortunate hero awakens to find himself alone aboard the spacecraft with luxurious accommodations and recreational facilities, but he cannot resume his sleep no matter what he tries. Imagine being trapped all alone aboard a vessel reminiscent either of Douglas Adams' novel ""Starship Titanic"" or Grant Naylor's novel ""Red Dwarf"" cruising on auto-pilot through the icy desolation of the galaxy with nobody to turn to for relief and assistance. No matter what he does, our hero cannot get a response from anybody about his ordeal. Moreover, he won't interact with another human until the ship enters orbit around its destination in 90 years! Indeed, the only thing that he can do is share his anguish with an oblivious android that mixes alcoholic beverages behind the bar and indulge in the recreational outlets aboard the ship. ""Imitation Game"" director Morten Tyldum and ""Prometheus"" scenarist Jon Spaihts synthesize the classic films ""Sleeping Beauty"" and ""Titanic"" in this promising 'what-if' scenario, but the characters aren't as compelling as the life and death crisis with which they must contend. Chiefly, Jennifer Lawrence's highly-strung, leading lady spends more time screaming than scheming, while the Chris Pratt hero tangles with a fate so tragic that he conducts himself in an ethically compromising manner that haunts him. Some of the obstacles that they confront are genuinely exciting, but ""Passengers"" amounts to a thoroughly predictable yarn riddled with plot holes that neither Tyldum and Spaihts nor Lawrence and Pratt can triumph over in this 116-minute, PG-13 rated opus. Ultimately, when you consider everything that everybody could have done to improve this flawed film, it is really a shame that ""Passengers"" doesn't live up to its potential.Basically, ""Passengers"" reminded me of those adventures that intrepid pilgrims embarked upon to enter a promised land for a better life. Jim Preston (Chris Pratt of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"") is a middle-class, mechanical engineer who cannot find his fortune on a vastly overpopulated planet Earth, so he books passage aboard the lavishly appointed corporate ferry Avalon for a faraway place designated Homestead II. There are two things that you should know from the outset about ""Passengers."" First, this sci-fi saga occurs so far into the future that all the guess work in space travel appears to have been accounted for by scientists so that nothing can possibly go wrong. Second, our hero and heroine don't contend with menacing alien creatures out to make a meal of them. Humanity is the only race that inhabits this half-baked escapade that wears out its welcome long before the Avalon reaches its destination. During the first 30 or so minutes, Jim Preston struggles to amuse himself aboard this spectacular spaceship. Some things about the craft are really cool. As it plies its way through the universe, this sophisticated, state-of-the-art spaceship has been designed to travel on auto-pilot with a huge, invisible shield deployed like a huge nose-cone to deflect anything perilous in its path. The asteroid field that it smashes its way through during the first few minutes evokes memories of ""Titanic,"" but the toll that the asteroid field takes on the Avalon doesn't create problems right away. After he awakens, Preston takes advantage of all the opportunities that the ship offers. As it turns out, the hibernation pods are scheduled to open during the last leg of the voyage, with the crew awakening months prior to the passengers so they can prepare them for disembarkation. When Jim isn't floating in alcohol, he tries to break into the bridge where the crew sleeps. Meantime, Jim browses through the passenger database and finds Aurora and admires her in her translucent hibernation pod. Eventually, about a year later, Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence of ""The Hunger Games"") joins Jim, and the fate that they are facing horrifies her. Jim has done everything that she suggests later to extricate them from their predicament. Initially, like all romantic movies, time takes a toll on Jim and Aurora's relationship, especially the conditions that prompted their rendezvous in space. We learn Aurora is a writer who wants to experience life first-hand on Homestead II and then return to Earth so she can write the first book about the experience. Unlike Jim, Aurora purchased a higher priced ticket and enjoys all the features of a first-class passenger. You can see the resemblance between ""Passengers"" and the Leonardo DiCaprio & Kate Winslet ""Titanic."" Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt generate enough charisma to make a sympathetic couple. Nevertheless, they can only do so many things before ""Passengers"" exhausts its spontaneity. The closest thing to another human is friendly android bartender Arthur (Michael Sheen of ""TRON: Legacy"") that polishes glasses, mixes drinks, and listens to them. You can figure out where ""Passengers"" is bound with its cliché-riddled 'boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back' plot. Once Jim and Aurora have broken up, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that something bigger must happen for them to repair the damage to their relationship. They must reconcile themselves and then figure out how to repair the catastrophic damage to the Avalon as it steadily deteriorates because of the asteroid field encounter. Lawrence and Pratt are more interesting than the one-dimensional characters that they portray. The arrival of another character to straighten things out doesn't really help matters in Spaihts' by-the-numbers screenplay. For the record, Hollywood has been struggling to develop this project for about a decade. Initially, Keanu Reeves and Reese Witherspoon were cast to play the two lovers, but scheduling difficulties derailed that enterprise. You won't get carried away with ""Passengers."""
" Its not stalking if he's hot!
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,4,"Where do I start with this mess of a movie? Aside from the plot being completely predictable, you cant relate to the leads, their romance is not believable, and choices made are completely out of character. I'm just going to go ahead and spoil the movie, because there's nothing great here to talk about, and I'm sure you would've seen it coming anyway.I could've totally seen Michael Sheen selling out Chris Pratt, the robot with no real sense of tact or any real emotional understanding was going to sell him out. I could've seen Lawrence Fishburne dying within 5 minutes (he is the black guy after all), and leaving Chris Pratt to save everyone. I could've even seen him surviving the ridiculous amount of postmortem procedures done on him, which I'm sure would've done more harm than good and ensure he would never even live a normal life again. I could've even seen Jennifer Lawrence choosing to stay with him at the end, despite it being out of character, all for the sake of the predictable plot.The movie does a good job of hiding that Chris Pratt was a manipulative sociopath. Just imagine, a guy is alone on a ship with 5000 people. For months, he reads and digs up into the files of a woman there, reading everything about her life and making a profile of her in his head. He decides this woman is perfect, and decides to wake her up from sleep to spend the rest of her life alone with him as her only company and keep her his companion forever. Were the genders swapped, it would've probably been ""romantic"", but as it's a guy, it's the synopsis for a horror movie, especially if it was average-looking guy. Except, the movie's way of making us sympathize with him: they make him hot. We don't hate him immediately because Chris Pratt is hot. He only gets a shot at redemption because he's hot. He lies to Jennifer Lawrence for a year, and when she finds out, she freaks out and reacts like any rational person would.At this stage, the movie could've worked on this new revelation showing how the characters grow and develop with each other, or even let Chris Pratt be punished for his actions, but instead they decide they're going to redeem his character, by having him be the only person who could save the ship from shutting down completely. Lawrence Fishburne awakens and promptly dies, leaving Chris Pratt as the only person to save the ship as he's conveniently a mechanic and Jennifer Lawrence is totally useless.It would've been easier to defend him from dooming Jennifer and robbing her of her lifelong dream, if she was useful in saving the ship. There is nothing in her skill set that allowed her to help anyone, short of pulling a switch at the end. Had her character awoken first, everyone would be dead. Being a writer is nice and all, but she existed solely and thoroughly as a love interest for Chris Pratt, it's almost as if him choosing her was supposed to represent the people who cast her. Her entire existence in the movie is to be hot.In the end, she chooses to stay with Chris Pratt and not go back to sleep, despite him dooming her to die on the ship. That was not believable in the slightest, and goes almost against her character. There are girls like her in real life, never happy with their current privileged lives, feeling the need to abandon their friends and family to compensate for being perpetually unhappy. She's the equivalent of the white girl who backpacks across Europe, except here it's another planet. She even treats it as such, with her just staying for a year. In the movie, there were videos of her friends begging her to stay, but she left them to live out her dreams.Jennifer Lawrence's character was a huge narcissist, and we see this when the Lawrence Fishburne is trying to fix the ship, but she wants him to focus on her personal problem of being woken up as opposed to saving everyone's lives. We see it again where she was willing to doom everyone on the ship over being alone. The movie tries to pass off she choosing to stay with Chris Pratt so that he won't be alone, but probably she knew that she can't be happy with a normal person, and a sociopath like Chris Pratt is better for her. That's the only way I could see her decision in the end making any sense. We cant relate to her, aside from her reactions to the news that Chris Pratt woke her up, and we are supposed to give it a pass because she's hot.Their romance doesn't even work. Chris Pratt is a technical, more hands-on guy, he would've done better with a more technical woman. Or maybe the movie was glossing over that Jennifer Lawrence's only option was him, and really had no other choice. And how did they gloss it over? Oh simple, they're both hot! It would've been a decent twist if she didn't return his affection, but I suppose if he wasn't Chris Pratt that may have been likely. The romance only works because Chris Pratt is hot, especially at the end. My aunt told me that if she was left alone on a ship with Lawrence Fishburne, she would've went back to sleep immediately. The movie just expects us to accept that Chris Pratt deserved his redemption because he's hot.When it really boils down to it, the movie relies almost entirely on their leads being as attractive as possible to distract us from the poor romance, sociopath male lead and narcissist female lead. It's basically a movie about hot people doing hot people things for teenage girls to get wet over and teenage guys to ogle Jennifer Lawrence."
" Bland, lazy and ultimately dumb.
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,4,"When mechanic Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) awakes from his hibernation 90 years too early he needs to figure out why he is the only person aboard the Avalon — an intergalactic spacecraft heading towards new colonised planet Homestead II — that isn't still in cryosleep. A lonely year goes by before another passenger, novelist Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence), wakes up. Together, with the dubious help of android bartender Arthur (Michael Sheen), they search for answers, all the while falling deeply in love. After the interesting first hour sets up the concept, builds the mystery and introduces the eminently likable central duo, the second half stumbles and splatters into a shockingly dull and unoriginal tale of, well, basically nothing. The script from Jon Spaihts expends all goodwill at an alarming rate as the unravelling plot takes us down the blandest and most uninspired rabbit hole imaginable, the biggest enigma being why in the world Pratt and Lawrence signed on for such a rote adventure. Worst of all, it gets dumb. Really, really dumb. And lazy. After emphasising over and over again how *insert machine/equipment/etc* can't possibly *insert problem/mishap/etc*, guess what? Turns out it can just because. A few gravity-loss scenes are impressive and showcase Norwegian director Morten Tyldum's capability with a big budget, however a couple of exterior sequences are strikingly similar to Gravity, which unfortunately only serves as a reminder of how inferior this film is within the genre. A frustratingly banal and unintelligent second half cements Passengers as one almighty missed opportunity. Disappointing."
" Critics can go jump
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,9,"I hate romance films. I'm also not the biggest fan of many of the scifi stuff circulating at the moment, particularly the space theme that seems to be the taste of the day. When a friend suggested Passengers, I agreed because she has to put up with my tastes most of the time. I was surprised I enjoyed this so much.Passengers was the most emotionally engrossing film I have seen in months. From the get go, you ache for Jim Preston and witness his demise sympathetically. When his loneliness/insanity causes him to wake another passenger, and thus takes her life away from her, there is no damnation of his character (not from me personally). The whole story has you questioning what you personally would do in that situation.The special effects were phenomenal: breathtaking shots of space and seamless editing. Yet despite being visually stunning, the film is much more emotionally outstanding.Don't listen to the critics. Loved this film"
" Love Story...in space????
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,7,"The critics are just wrong when it comes to Passengers. It's not action filled or has a plethora of alienswhat is does have is a unique love story and a moral dilemma. Of course it IS essentially a love story but it is set in space. Chris Pratt is Jim, one of the 5000 passengers on a giant spaceship traveling to a distant new colony that will take 120 years. His sleeping pod malfunctions and he wakes up 90 years too soon. He finds out that he can't go back into suspended animation.so what is he to do? I won't go into details so as not to spoil the story. What I will say is that the critics are wrong: go see for yourself. The visuals are stunning and the acting is quite awesome. Of course you have the gorgeous and talented Jennifer Lawrence and the always adorable Chris Pratt as the two leads.....and Michael Sheen as the bartender is quite entertaining! I really enjoyed this film and I would tell people to just take a chance and go see it.it's more than a love story. What would you do if you were in Jim's place?"
" Intelligent and believable Sci-Fi
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,9,"This review contains spoilers so stop reading if you haven't seen the movie. Personally I can't understand what the professional film critics didn't like about this movie. Are all movies from now on supposed to be politically correct and without any flawed decisions by any of the characters? Actually I liked the movie Passengers very much and I did not miss the wild action scenes that have made other Sci-Fi movies so popular. There was drama, an intelligent plot and something for us viewers to think about; ""Would I have woken someone up?"" I know I would have woken someone up, since being alone for a week or a month is bearable, but to know you will be alone for the rest of your life, totally unbearable."
" At least Boxing Helena was honest
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,1,"This is a rape fantasy masked as a sci-fi romance. Don't poison your mind or the minds of your children by watching this movie. Passengers should have been marketed as a rape culture horror or perhaps a thriller set it space with the monster being the ubiquitous idea that every woman today has to deal with daily: The idea that if a man stalks a woman long enough and sneakily enough that he will get to have sex with her and she will love him because he is ""one of the good guys"". No, just no. This isn't a ""good guy"" role no matter how much he sees himself as the hero.The saddest thing, Passenger could have been an excellent film exploring this predatory and objectifying mentality by simply cutting some of the scenes and changing the musical score to something more ominous."
" Very Enjoyable SciFi Movie
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,7,"Forget some of the lackluster reviews - this is a very enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours and it worth the trip to the big screen.Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt are enjoyable to watch and the story is not as far fetched as it may seem to some reviewers. Traveling through space, alone, figuring out how to live life in such a lonesome environment.Early on, I had the impression that Jennifer Lawrence may not have been fully involved; but, after her first scene or two, that feeling disappeared and she delivered her usual excellence.Head to the theater, get a big tub of popcorn, sit back, and enjoy a couple of hours of good escapism."
" Titanic in space
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,8,"This movie's first half was fantastic. It's second half, particularly the last part, was very over the top. Let's just say that they should have made that spaceship of whatever Chris Pratt is made from in this movie and nothing would have happened to that ship. All in all, a very fun movie, with reasonably well fleshed out characters (for a Hollywood movie I mean), and a good solid story that is thought out well enough to carry the movie and keep you as a viewer interested most of the time. I would also recommend this to people who normally do not like sci-fi (like me), because of the thriller element. That keeps the movie interesting enough even if you are not into epic space ships, etc."
" This science nerd liked it!
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,9,"Some of the early reviews waved off this movie for it's lack of ""plausible science"". I beg to differ. I had way more issues with Interstellar. Passengers is a complete movie, executed perfectly. You will not hate yourself for buying a ticket. For me Passengers is a ""next-day"" movie, I'm still thinking about it the day after. The effects are perfect. The script is organic and at times funny. The story is compelling. The acting was excellent. It's a movie that has something for everyone, not just sci-fi nerds. I'm glad I saw this movie!There are few Hollywood movies that depict the laws of nature perfectly. The movies that get science right tend to be stiff and pedantic. Films that abandon science tend to be goofy comic book fair. There seems to be a trade off, give up science for story. Passengers is the perfect blend for me."
" Best at its darkest, average at its brightest
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,7,"I assumed the highlight of this movie would be the chemistry between the two (hyper)charismatic leads, but surprisingly the best part of the movie was it's exploration of complete isolation and loneliness. While it's not much of a spoiler, I will not reveal anything specific about what happens, other than that one character faces a very interesting moral dilemma, and that this is a major part of the film.But somehow, this is not the major plot point of the movie. The latter part of the film is about a different problem faced by the protagonists, and is more blockbuster-like and less interesting. It's not bad, it's still a good movie, but it feels like the cop out on a cool idea (the moral dilemma) because they feel obliged to have lots of action and peril.I liked the setting and the scenario, and I would not feel bad recommending this movie as a light scifi-watch, but in it there's a much more interesting movie in the moral dilemma."

" Genuinely imaginative sci-fi
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,9,"I am definitely not a sci-fi enthusiast, and I am inspired to write this review by its being the film of this genre that I have enjoyed the most. I realize this is not a popular view, but I am hoping that its being unusual is what makes it worth presenting. Since much of what I like so much about it bears implicitly on what I generally dislike about the genre, it might be better to skip this review if you are a devotee of the latter.Jim Preston, a would-be space colonist accidentally and irrevocably brought out of hibernation only thirty years into a hundred-and-twenty year voyage, finds himself alone among the five thousand unconscious passengers, and, after a year of miserable loneliness, succumbs to the temptation to awaken Aurora Lane, a beautiful and lively young woman, to be his companion. A love affair soon blossoms, but without her realizing she has been deliberately awoken.  Though the science involved is well beyond our present reach, in its effects it is readily understandable and credible, while still being dramatic and sometimes visually stunning. Too often in science fiction, far-fetched ideas and absurd aliens are offered as a pathetic substitute for the real feast of the imagination to which we are treated here, where we are confronted by how human beings might behave under extreme but imaginable circumstances which force them to ponder the point of their existence. The setting of outer space is beside the point as regards the dilemmas raised. The question, for example, of what might motivate a space traveler to abandon for ever the world and people he has known is not very different to that which has confronted colonists for the last three thousand years. Nuance too reigns in this story, not simplistic black and white morality: can any man honestly say he would have felt no temptation whatsoever to awaken Aurora? The humour is rich, gentle and often ironic, never coarse or in one's face. There is easily enough of it to stop the film taking itself too seriously, while it complements rather than undermines the dramatic tension, an example being when Jim sends a desperate communication to Earth about his predicament only to learn a reply will be forthcoming in an estimated fifty-five years. The android bartender is a delightful third character, his apparent decency and humanity cleverly juxtaposed against the reality that he is not human and feels nothing.There is only one other, minor character, making the film dangerously dependent on the acting of the two main characters, but the film-makers were well rewarded for the risk they took: Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence play them superbly.Edmund Marlowe, author of Alexander's Choice, a novel, amazon.com/dp/1481222112"
" Itwas pretty good
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,9,"It wad pretty good .The only problem was the 3D. IT was not shot in it.It was converted instead.The distance shot of depth was good,but when it came to the close ups ,like the close up of handsome actor Chris Pratt nose and tears coming out of his eyes,when he is in outer space.If it was shot in actual 3d camera the depth of the close up in the faces would have been stronger,compare to the close up of that actors face ,the leading one in the 1983 Metal Storm.Converted 3D does not being strong third dimension feature on an actor face on close ups.They are subtle in 3D.That is the only problem.The movie was good.It was like the old 1964 Robinson Crusoe on Mars.Something goes wrong in the sleeping ,machines that are taking passenger to a new earth but , they have to wait 99 years.Something goes wrong and Chris wakes up.He tries to find out how fix the problem.He even send a letter to earth ,which takes it years to get back and too high for the postage.He falls for beautiful sleeping Jennifer Lawrence and break the machine down so he won't be lonely.She later find out that he force her to wake up and she is mad at him.The special affect of the distance 3D shots in outer space are good Like the fire in the machine that goes in circles as they try to repair the machine.Michael Sheen,is he related to Martin? plays a robot bartender.This story seems to preach the evils of technology. That it can break down and if we turn back to nature like would be easier.Sure That why back in the 12th century people died at 40,cause they were living by nature.The movie is a little sexy.Chris's builds pops out of the screen and Jennifer's form pops out too.They are both sexy on screen.I was drawn to the film ,without realizing that the actor who was in phony 3d Jurassic World, was in it too.Laurence Fishburne shows up ,in his up tenth 3d film ,as the man who knows how to fix the space ship .He is dying of a disease,Hollywood disease.So both Jennifer and Chis have to make up to fix it.This combination of romance with science fiction is pretty good .I only wish that it was actually shot in 3D.01/01/17"
" The Andy Garcia Movie!
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,8,"After watching the truly abysmal but highly rated Arrival I wasn't expecting much for this lower rated movie but was actually surprised how good it is.The production values are simply superb and acting top notch especially the huge climax at the end with Andy Garcia that makes the movie. It provides a small amount of tension waiting for Andy's appearance. You are constantly asking yourself when will he appear?The story is a good one, not overly complicated but one that rings true based on the circumstances. No weird twists or surprises really but still satisfying.It's a nice journey with some inventive ideas shown for what the future will be like. The romance is well done. Seems like a film that has enough of interest for both male and female viewers and its easy to follow so OK to view with a beer each."
" Very very nice
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,9,"I'm not going to say anything you wouldn't know from the trailer. Lawrence and Pratt, both attractive leads, are unexpectedly awake on an interstellar colony ship where all passengers and crew are supposed to be in hibernation. And it's good they're around, because Houston there's some problems. What I like best is the beautiful scenes of space and the pacing of this movie, it takes its time letting you appreciate the strange surroundings including a wonderful Sheen as Arthur the bartender. My wife says this is combination sci-fi and chick flick, and who am I to disagree with her? That's all I care to say about this at the moment except I like the wrap up. Enjoy."
" Mildly entertaining.
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,5,"Of course we must suspend disbelief to enjoy any work of fiction, especially science fiction. This flick just asks too much.One example, from many ... he's in a tube and subject to venting of a nuclear reactor. Vaporized and his atoms shot into space at hundreds of miles an hour, right? Heck no! He's not only intact, but the only physical damage was his tether to the ship was snapped ... yet he still drifted within reach of his spaceship-tethered costar.Oh, need another? A state-of-the-art interplanetary transport ship is sophisticated enough to carry thousands of passengers and crew for 100-year journeys through light-years of space ... but runs smack onto an asteroid belt ... then keeps flying for years with a hole in its hull!Puhleez! Spare us!"
" Good story, really nice visuals and highly likable main characters
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,8,"Why on Earth would we wanna travel 120 years in hibernation to start all over again on a planet in another galaxy?First of all... to give us a nice story to tell. Because whether you like or dislike SF, it is a really nice story with magnificent visuals. You'll smile, occasionally laugh, feel sorry and get tense accordingly to the story-line. It has everything to be a good story.Passengers is telling how two people have to find a way to survive a hostile environment. Due to the setting it is an extremely deadly environment... space.Even though a few scene's are actually not as realistic as they may seem, it fits and does not distract you from the story for long. The interaction between the main characters is admirably good. You really understand why they do what they do, even when it comes to Arthur, the robot.I think it's a nice and decent story which a lot of people will enjoy watching. It definitely deserves a solid 8."
" Passengers review
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,9,"Now, first off, I have seen the RT score for this film before going to see it; about four or five days prior, more specifically. And just for that, I became somewhat nervous about seeing about seeing the film. So after doing just that, I will say that this film was ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING. I have no idea why it has the rating that it does (I mean, I would expect it to be at least somewhere in the 50s), because this movie is one of the best I've seen all year. The movie is directed by Morten Tyldum, written by Jon Spaihts, and stars Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt who share very decent chemistry with one-another.With all of that said, I must say that this by far the best Sci-fi film I have ever seen since Interstellar. I mean, the opening was, there I say, breathtaking, but the way the whole thing is executed is absolutely brilliant! Now many critics, from what I know, have complained about its story-line, and I can certainly understand why.From my first thoughts, as soon as Aurora awakens from her pod, Jim immediately goes running off to, what I can assume, hide from her until she walks out and about the same way he did. And when introducing himself to her, there really isn't much of a mystery behind him; we already know him but we don't really know her, or so we think. Maybe if they had switched the first and second and, then maybe we would've gotten to know HER character more before his. But that really isn't the case.It seems as though many have complained about the way the plot was structured, but half of them, surprisingly, have criticized it for its execution of most things; more specifically, the fact that Pratt's character wakes Lawrence's up. And yes, I'm aware that they didn't make that quite clear in the trailer. But for the sake of unpredictability, I'm actually glad that they didn't. The first half of this movie focuses entirely on Pratt's character, Jim. And the reason for which is because we UNDERSTAND HIS ACTIONS. Being the only human awake and active on a ship for that long, that can and would be very difficult to cope with.The one problem I DID have, however (but it may just be a nitpick), was during the first act when Pratt had that long facial hair coming in; not only did it look laughably fake, it seemed goofy and a little bit out of place.For my final verdict, for a long time I was expecting to see a science fiction movie that would let me actually think, and that is exactly what I got when and after viewing this; like Interstellar, as well as 2001: A Space Odyssey, IT LET'S YOU USE YOUR MIND."
" Somewhat Disappointing
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,6,"My expectations were just too high with this otherwise terrific presentation.Pros: Visually stunning. The CGI and spaceship design gets high fives all around. Truly a remarkable achievement here. I was in awe of the visual presentation and the enormous amount of thought that must have gone into this work.Great acting. Both main characters deliver a performance with an emotional range that is very believable. How would you handle yourself all alone on a gigantic ship irreversibly hurling through space? You'll find the answers here for sure.Cons: Fishburne's character seems mildly odd and out of place in the story. I find it too remarkable a coincidence a high-ranking crew member would accidentally be woken up just in time to provide much needed help as far as gaining access to secured areas of the ship. This derailed the plot for me a great deal.Bad science. When you are a confirmed Sci-Fi fan, you have to get used to things like that. But there are some truly glaring anomalies here. The ship is supposed to be traveling at 93,000 miles a second, or half the speed of light. That's 335 MILLION miles an hour. You are not going to be able to view a passing star with such magnificent grandeur, but again the CGI is overwhelmingly good, so it's forgivable. Unsatisfying ending. Too quick and convenient. I would have loved to know far more about how the main characters lived out the rest of their lives rather than the little bit that was shown. It simply left too many questions unanswered.Overall, not a waste of money or time, but 'Passengers' falls far short of making true cinematic history and will not be considered a classic in the sci-fi genera.Oh, well."
" Fascinating storyline, great writing/acting, beautiful scenes
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,9,"I rarely watch a movie that stays in my head or that I want to watch again. But this film had all the components: engaging storyline, compelling acting, beautiful scenes. The story was somewhere between a techno-future retelling of Adam and Eve and great love story. The idea of moving to a new colony planet, why a person would do that and the challenges characters face when their hybernation is interrupted, along the human struggle when met with a lifetime of solitude made the story very compelling. I've never seen Chris Pratt before, but his acting was excellent in this role. It's as much a psychological/human story as it is sci-fi. I found the ethical dilemma center to the story to be believable, and the ending. It's not a simple girl chooses guy/love, if that's how you see Aurora's character, you're not paying attention. She does write the epic story with a 5,000 passenger captive audience (and everyone back on earth since it's the first time anything like this happened on a colony ship), she just doesn't get to enjoy the fame; it isn't what she planned, which is one of the themes that resonates."
" Both Actors Do Nail It =)
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,8,"If you're expecting thrill or action, well, this is not that kind of movie.The way I see it, it make me feel like I am watching Titanic in another version that has less drama, less bullshit, less ""too much"" things, with way stronger Rose and much wiser Jack. You guys did a really good job, Chris and Jennifer.How this movie tells the story is really quite predictable. You'll know what is going to be next since the beginning till its ending. However, it really good to watch and I really love to see it again in theater. Backstage teams who designed and built the ship with all of its detail are also the ones who can take the credit of this film. The ship is really spectacular than other spaceship movies I've ever seen.So, my 8 scores are for great actors and ship designer team. And, Jennifer, you really do shine bright and strong. I find it your best work of all. =) (Sorry, I don't quite like you in Hunger Games)"
" Best Sci Fi Movie of 2016
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,10,"Passengers is the movie that confirmed for me that film critics are not qualified to rate movies for anyone but film critics. Throughout this movie, I kept thinking to myself, this should be a best picture nominee. I mean it was really well done. I also was astonished at how critics could pan this wonderful film. Perhaps I am overrating the movie due to some personal bias, however I generally have had a feel for Oscar worthy endeavors. First, if a movie convinces you, rather than simply makes you accept plot elements, then that is the hallmark of a well filmed movie. Passengers creates moral and emotional dilemmas and convinces you of their validity. Also, the chemistry between Pratt and Lawrence is solid. You find yourself contemplating how you would proceed given the scenarios faced by the actors in this great movie. Go and see this thoughtful, emotional, satisfying Sci fi movie. You will not be disappointed. An added plus is some terrific imagery and Sci fi moments that are the relish to the contemplative and moral sandwich that the filmmakers prepared for you to consume."
" Between two stools.
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,2,"This movie falls to the ground really hard.Creators of the film did set the ambitious and extremely difficult task. Making a movie with a simple plot, limited amount of characters; with romance and action elements in a modern SF shell, promising to be a piece of art.   What filmmakers had initially? - Good, professional and profitable cast - Budget - A fine director *well I did think so* -Aggressive marketing. U can not wish more.Shades of genres replace each other during the movie. Adventure, Drama, Romance. What did we get after all?All Random mode is real here. Random events force random people to make random actions yet the trailer promises us an interesting and captivating story. If you are here for a good screenplay - pass by. There were a lot of prerequisites for huge dramatic twists. But we get nothing. All the rough edges are softened. The plot makes characters live in a disbelief world. No dramatic events at all. A $ 110000000 movie (my head hurts) denies basic laws of physics several times. It is a classic flaw of crappy SF movies: when some horrifyingly complicated engine is going crazy and all is falling apart, you already know halfway through how the problem will be solved.Romance? More like bromance. While perfect acting of Chris Pratt actually is believable, Jennifer looks like a lackluster. A simple eye candy whom Chris leaves no ""blanket"". The dissonance makes acting chemistry look questionable. Typical ""Love u, hate u, ah, screw this, love u again"". You can not empathize with the female hero: even if she dies, well, good for us. Like the world needed another annoying ass selfish writer who can not even write.Action and visual effects were on point. The set decorator and the production designer did a lot of work. And again we are facing the ugly truth of the modern filmmaking: graphics and world design out-weights, distracts, aims to hide ALL the flaws of the screenplay and directing.Enormous amount of resources (human and financial) were invested in this just to make a beautiful picture which gives nothing new, fresh or artistically valuable. Everything is used a lot of times. Here ""Gravity"" cosplay, there some robovac and android trivia. Not one bit creativity.1 star for well-crafted environment and visuals. 1 star for Chris Pratt as he carried the only exciting first minutes.The rest is not worth mentioning. U can never trick a true connoisseur of movie art. No CGI can replace good old directing and screenplay, not today. Sorry 'bout that."
" A classic Sci Fi
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,8,"What I loved: - the remoteness and isolation that defines many good sci fis. - the great technology on display - much of which is already in development. - it had the moral dilemma which also helps define many good sci fis - the story's pacing was good - the balance of drama, action, romance, comedy - spot onWhat I didn't like: - Jennifer Lawrence is no favourite of mine - just too outspoken and political outside of acting that I can't help being repulsed by this self-important and opinionated actress.Overall: went in with low expectations but was very pleasantly surprised by a really solid sci fi."
" Sappy romance disguised as sci-fi movie
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,4,"Passengers is a simple story of two people stranded on a desert island who get in love because there is nobody else available nearby. That sums it up, but the official plot line is the following: in a not too near future Earth is overcrowded (surprise surprise) and a big corporation offers the opportunity (at high price) to go to live on new terraformed planets. As they don't FTL most of the travel has to be done in cryogenic stasis on the space equivalent of a transatlantic. They are supposed to stay asleep for 120 years, but the impact with an asteroid 30 years after the departure causes a lot of tiny malfunctioning, including one chamber. A mechanical engineer is awaken on the ghost ship, he doesn't have access to the bridge of the chambers of the crew, the automatic robots on the ship are of no help and the most human face is the android of the lounge bar. After one year of getting mad he decides to awake another passenger, an attractive journalist, without of course telling her he has done on purpose, as in every relation based on a lie everything goes great until she finds out the truth...in the meantime the small malfunctioning escalate until the entire ship is in danger of self destruction... I don't think it's necessary to add anything else, while a fan of sci-fi movies of the same type (in particular Pandorum, a forgotten movie from years ago deals with the same scenario in more horror way and it's way superior to passengers) I found this film disappointing at best. The entire premise of the movie, that a company will build a completely automatized ship that doesn't allow to return in stasis, is simply ludicrous for a mechanical engineer (like me) used to work with the concept of ""risk assessment"", the right solution for these scenarios are to wake up at least some members of the crew to check the ship and let them return in stasis once they are sure everything goes fine. The idea of not letting anybody to access to the vital systems of the ship is simply criminal, but it's a plot device to allow the love story to go on. The cast indeed is good, Lawrence is a great actress and fills the screen even in stupid movies like this one, his sidekick is also good, Fishburne is the best even if he has less screen time, and also, and Sheen perfect in the role of the android barman, even if I find his weasel smile quite untrustworthy and I was always thinking he would have tried to kill the protagonists sooner or later. In conclusion as a sci-fi movie is awful and disappointing, but I assume the female audience will love that. As I already written, I would recommend to watch the lesser known Pandorum, an office flop but a more satisfying movie all around."
" romantic-sci-fie story with a touch of futurism
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,8,"Loved this romantic story with a touch of futurism. The deep dark human relationship between two entirely different persons is worth watching for. Whether action supports results or results support action is a lengthy discussion in the human relationship that is well represented here. However, I could not comprehend why someone had to die!I have to say that the actress looked stunningly beautiful. The bartender looked creepy. What crept me most was why the crew who woke up had to die. There was no real reason for that person to wake up. There was no particular idea what his part was except to fill the gaps. The computer should have been able to state honestly that a system failure happened. That other person is completely not needed in the movie."
" Nothing exceptional
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,5,"It's beautiful, yes. The two actors are great together, but ... Somehow, the plot isn't that attractive, not for a two-hour long movie. Plus, I'm disappointed with Gus' death. I mean, he gets so little time on screen, and it just feels like he's only there to change the game and, finally, accelerate the pace of the movie. I'd categorize this as a romance movie, so much it's centered around the couple and their relationship - how it comes to be. Also, I don't know, I guess I was also annoyed by the reference to Noe (hello, Chris Pratt's beard) and to Sleeping Beauty (in the same movie!). I guess this felt like a one-too-many just-like-the-others kind of movie."
