" Dreadfully boring, should've just been a short film
",2021-03-18 00:00:00,1,"What a serious waste of fantastic stop-motion. Movie's way too long for what it is, and extremely boring to watch, whole story could've been put into a 20-min short film. Most of the runtime is just filler, useless scenes that add nothing to the story or to character development.
Another critique is how they've only got 3 voice actors. One for the main, another for secondary, and one guy who voices literally every other character. I feel like that's just because they were too cheap to spend money on a proper amount of voice actors for the film, and that really retracts from the whole thing.
Overall just skip this one, a gigantic waste of time."
" Could have been a short.
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,5,"I didn't like this as a film but is in the after thought that I can find a lot of value, i have zero to non empathy for the MC so I guess is harder to get into the movie plus the pacing can get real slow, and the cherry on top I hate when in an animated movie they dicide to go realistic and don't exploit the fantasy, though there may be a metaphor there."
" Extremely weird: I'm really on the fence with this one
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,5,"I mean I love the art style and the concept, but I don't know. It's really bizarre. Really really strange. Just left me feeling rather confused and unsettled"
" Nah - just couldn't get on with it!
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,3,"I don't recomend it, unless you want to make yourself feel inescapably depressed.It was just so boring. A couple of interesting elements, with the animation, and other aspects of it used to really emphasise depression in this case, but it all served to make the movie rather more of a monotany than a meaningfully throught provoking experience.There are some rather inflated reviews for it out there, by a good number of critics, the vast majority gushing about it, which indicates that something was either lost on me or, at the time it came out, it was a film considered to be trendy to like.3/10 (some points for some interesting, albeit wearing, elements)."
" Boring and metaphysical-ish
",2020-10-22 00:00:00,3,"I must have probably watched another film than most of the reviewers here. The story is about this extremely successful english guy, who while being on conferences cheats on his wife and then he somehow meets a young lady to whom he feels attracted and with whom he wants to spent a night (after he unsuccessfully called another ex). So what's new here and why on earth should anyone identify themselves with him or want to find out what's going on on his mind (beware one never does actually). What was the film all about? There is a mysterious metaphysical level, which turns out to be even more stupid and mundane, in that everyone who is boring to him speaks with his voice. Of course in the end he returns to his wife and everything is fine. Except from the viewer who probably cannot stop thinking what was this all about....."
" Nothing to see here
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,3,"You just witness the main character being miserable for an hour and a half with absolutely no point to it, i.e. every film directed by Charlie Kaufman.
This is the last film i was baited to watch from this director."
" Sometimes there's no lesson. That's a lesson in itself.
",2020-10-03 00:00:00,6,"The puppets make interactions more interesting, there was something very soft and realistic in the flirting scene and the sexe scene, it's not what you usually see in movies that always have to make everything ""sexy"". The rest felt so strange that I was waiting for the character to ""wake up"". I know it's the atmosphere the director wants but it made me ""not believe"" what I was seeing."
" Technically impressive and incredibly humane
",2020-09-27 00:00:00,8,"Charlie Kaufman has always put together fantastic and thought-provoking movies so I naturally get excited before I'm about to watch one. Anomalisa is another fantastic addition to his body of work.Anomalisa follows Michael, who is tired of the mundanity in his life but soon experiences something special after meeting a woman named Lisa.Apart from Human Nature and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, I have seen every Kaufman film and loved every single one of them. Anomalisa is yet another film where Kaufman studies the human psyche and it's one of the best looking animated films I've seen. Since Kaufman doesn't have experience with stop motion, Duke Johnson came to help and the stop motion animation is visually striking. Despite being small in scale, the world of Anomalisa feels incredibly real. There are some impressive long takes where we follow characters into different rooms. Considering the challenges of stop motion, doing a long take is incredibly difficult so I have to praise the hard work put in by the animators because on a technical level this film is phenomenal.This film isn't just style over substance because Charlie Kaufman adds so much depth and purpose to the characters and scenarios. This is a film that is sure to resonate with a lot of people. As of right now, I cannot relate to it as much but a few years down the line I may really connect with its themes. I love how interpretive Anomalisa is. It's not just a film you forget after finishing it. I still find myself thinking about the ending and other details. The voice acting is really good. David Thewlis does a terrific job as Michael and Jennifer Jason Leigh is absolutely fantastic as Lisa.Anomalisa is another fantastic Kaufman film that's not only technically impressive but also humane and relatable. It's sad to see a talented writer like him struggle to fund his movies. I really hope he continues to write and direct more films as there is no writer like Charlie Kaufman."
" Plasticine navel-gazing
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,3,"I found this reasonably enjoyable, but the character of Michael Stone was just so self-centred, irritating and somewhat unbelievable that a rating of 3/10 feels pretty generous. (I really struggled to see him as some sort of customer care guru: his insights appeared to be nothing more than commonsense.)On the weirdness front, I think there was a bit too much: the visual weirdness was all that was needed to draw the attention of the viewer. Some of the weird stuff that happened (or not) in the hotel, simply left me questioning how much of what we were seeing was meant to be real and how much was taking place in Michael Stone's head.I very much enjoyed Being John Malkovich, but didn't like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, so perhaps Charlie Kaufman is not really my cup of tea."
" Ridiculously stupid
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,1,Critics call it a masterpiece. Typical snobbish BS. It's completely unsatisfying.
" unique experience.
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,8,"After being familiar with Kaufman movies, I knew coming into this I had to be very open minded.The results are pleasurable but it's definitely not a movie for everyone. I'll start off saying there's only 3 actors in the entire movie. I really enjoyed the voices of Daniel Thewlis and Jennifer Jason Leigh and their unusual bond throughout the film. Leigh, in particular, has a very soothing voice which worked excellent in this. I wasn't a fan of Tom Noonan being the voice of ""everyone else"" and it's extremely clear that he plays all of the other characters voices. I couldn't grasp the female voices he was playing because it just didn't feel right.The stop motion animation was done well, and at times incredibly realistic, even hauntingly so.I understood the movies message as it becomes clear near the end, but I ultimately thought that the plot got really convoluted and became more of a mind trip into outer reality which didn't seem to suit the movies theme or direction it seemed to be heading in after the first hour. This where I felt they rushed things. I wanted to like or feel more sympathy for Michael but the direction of his character seemed to have stalled and it all feels confusing. However Lisa is the opposite where I enjoyed her and her story.It's hard to further elaborate on this one, it's definitely not for everyone. The first hour will get you hooked but the last 30 mins or so had me watching on a spinning top.I may come across as harsh in my review but if you want something different and you like Lost in Translation or Her, you will enjoy this. You will also enjoy this if you like Kaufman's work."
" It's classic weird, ambitious Kaufman, but it's such a simple, existential premise that it really works
",2020-09-03 00:00:00,7,"Having been more mixed than most on Being John Malkovich and Synecdoche, NY, and having not been that high on stop motion animation in Wes Anderson films, Anomalisa seemed sure to miss the mark for me. Instead, it really impressed me with an interesting and classically Kaufman existential struggle within a very ordinary man's life. I kept feeling like everyone looked and sounded the same, but it wasn't until the wonderful nightmare sequence that I consciously thought about it. It's a really fun premise: a regular, routine-driven man sees everyone as the same, and out of nowhere meets someone who is finally unique. As a midlife crisis affair struggle story, I certainly like this one over the others out there. I would not have minded a bit more background on his relationship with his wife, as that would help understand why he sees her as the same person as everyone else. This is Anomalisa's story, though, and it's nice the way we see her through Michael's eyes: as this fresh, unexpected person. This is one I could see growing on me and bumping up to an 8, but for now I'll leave it as a 7 as while I love the premise, I would've liked the early scenes to emphasize how routine his life is and why there is such a lack of excitement. It's a really well done movie that I'm happy to see was acclaimed as much as it was."
" Bad bad bad movie!
",2020-08-19 00:00:00,3,Should have been a short film of 15 mintues not an hour and a half! What a waste of my time
" Terrible
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,1,"Terrible pacing, terrible voice acting from the cast with plenty of cringeworthy scenes. None of the ""jokes"" land at all. The movie has no real plot whatsoever only the message that we are all very similar to each other and assimilate together instead of standing out like Lisa.1/10"
" Touching
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,8,"A well-focused story, told with sophisticated puppets and stop-motion animation. A married, somewhat morose man flies to Cincinnati for business, checks into a posh hotel, and meets a few women for drinks in the hotel bar. Interestingly, the guy perceives the voices of everyone around him as being the same, men and women included (such as an old girlfriend he looks up), showing in a way how greyed out his world has become, essentially distilled down to him and not-him, everyone else. He is successful in his work but not a success in life, in part because he doesn't treat people as unique individuals, as if something is dead inside him. Ironically, he's a guru in the field of customer service for companies, teaching others the importance of seeing their customers as individuals and treating them with respect. He says the words but seems to have long passed the point at which he lives them.The man meets an awkward, shy young woman with low self-esteem, and the pair hit it off. There is something pure and honest about her, something untouched by the world, and her voice is different for him. I won't spoil the plot any further, except to say there are some incredibly painful and true moments as things play out (man, that breakfast scene...). It's balanced by little bits of comedy sprinkled in, and the film pointing out that it's our outlook on life, holding on to our humanity, that's the important thing. I loved the level of realism in the details in things like the taxi ride and the hotel, and the elements of surrealism that hint at the film's symbolism. It's a very unique and creative film, well done."
" Fully singular, but deeply painful throughout
",2020-07-15 00:00:00,7,"First, the pros. The animation style is very unique and always interesting to the eye. It's fun to look at it, and creepy too, so it adds to the immense level of discomfort that this film provides. There is a realness to the subject matter that is undeniably heavy, and the way it unfolds is all too relatable. The movie is full of themes, feelings, and moments that you don't WANT to relate to, but, you probably will. It's one of the more bleak films I have seen in some time.Though it's innovation and psychological effectiveness were impressive, the problem for me is that the viewing experience itself really had very little redeeming values. Not much about the film was actually enjoyable. Tom Noonan doing almost all of the voices in the film was really hard for me to get comfortable with, especially considering my only impression of him was in the movie House Of The Devil, which I very strongly disliked (both as a whole, and his presence specifically), though it did serve a thematic purpose in the end.I really perceived the entire film as being about a man who hates himself, and his family, and therefore hates everyone else in the world too. He is an extremely unlikeable character who is thinking and acting in a despicable manner throughout the entire film. We have to watch him abuse his position of power upon an innocent person (the only likable character in the film) and it's deeply painful to sit through. Generally, I love films with characters like this IF it leads to some sort of redemption, or if it's delivered as dark comedy. However, this film is almost entirely humorless, and there is no lesson in the end other than displaying human existence as a sort of inescapable hellscape. I don't believe I'd ever want to watch this again."
" A depressing and heartfelt character study
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,7,"Anomalisa tells a story about a customer service expert/author, Michael Stone, who has difficulties connecting with others in his day-to-day life until he met someone special during his business trip to Cincinnati.Anomalisa gives audiences a very insightful look at a man's battle with depression, loneliness, and melancholy. It is implied in the movie that Michael is suffering from Fregoli delusion - a rare disorder in which a person holds a delusional belief that different people are a single person who changes appearance or is in disguise. I thought the movie did a great job in highlighting this disorder that is tormenting Michael.The movie is largely driven by captivating dialogues and conversations which gives audiences a deeper understanding of the character. Part of what makes the dialogues and conversations so captivating is the use of voice. In the movie, David Thewlis, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Tom Noonan delivered brilliant and enchanting voice-acting performances. David Thewlis's performance as Michael was a stand-out as his emotions could be felt through the use of his voice.The movie made use of animation/stop-motion as a medium to tell its story. I thought it was brilliantly-animated - with very good use of lighting. The camera work is also brilliant and much appreciated.I think the movie's pacing is an issue here. Some of the scenes dragged on for way too long and served little to no purpose.Overall, Anomalisa is an interesting character study that is depressing and heartfelt. It is not perfect in any way, but it still deserves to be watched."
" Unique but hollow
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,6,"I hate to use the word ""pretentious"" for anything because I like to understand the creator's intention before judging. Yet I can't find the real meaning behind this one. Yes, it is well made, it shows very realistic interactions, it shows the protagonist's mid-life ennui very effectively. But there's not much beyond this."
" Kaufman-esque
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,7,"Kaufman blending depression, loneliness and animation together? I'm in! Also, this movie freaked me out, the same voice actor voiced almost every side character so yeah it's very creepy."
" Disappointed.
",2020-05-07 00:00:00,4,"I'm a huge Kauffman fan and maybe this led my expectations too high - perhaps I wanted another masterpiece like Synecdoche, New York, and ended up with a brief study on individuality consisting of a 1h set up and 30 minutes of delivery.I also kept thinking how much better this would have worked at a live action and I'm not surprised Kauffman initially refused to have the script adapted to make a stop motion film."
" I am sorry but run...
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,1,"No. No. No. NO.
This movie was a total waste of my time. Nothing happens. Run."
" Unique, but originality only gets you so far
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,6,"I decided to watch 'Anomalisa' as it sounded interesting and it's not often you get an animated film made exclusively for adults. It's fair to say that this is a very weird film and, although it had me hooked from start to finish, I was left with mixed feelings overall.The animation is really fascinating - the attention to detail and the way the characters move and act is somehow both realistic and robot-like, which I'm sure was done deliberately. It's also very creepy, especially when all the characters start acting and sounding identical. I liked the sheer strangeness of it all.The problem is that, for all the film's uniqueness and originality, there isn't much of a plot. It's about a sad and lonely middle-aged man who experiences an 'anomaly' when he meets a girl - it would have perhaps made a decent short, but there's just not enough going on to justify a full length film."
" Finding that someone who resonates with you
",2020-02-05 00:00:00,7,"All Charlie Kaufman films I've seen so far have been about the banality of modern life and about people desperately trying to reach through an empty void in order to find someone to hold their hand. Often in vain.Anomalisa takes this concept rather further than expected. David Thewlis voices the main character, Michael Stone, a successful author, who's nevertheless bored to tears by all the people in his life. They all look much the same, sound the same, act the same. And usually that's a figure of speech, but there's actually a good reason why this film is a puppet animation. And the fact that it is, makes it a thousand times more poignant.Then Michael happens to meet Lisa (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and everything in his life lurches sideways. We're taken on a whirlwind trip throughout their night together and it's quite something else. At the same time bittersweet and achingly realistic, while also a bit silly and absurd. You look at these two trying to form a connection and your heart breaks because they're building on sand. And oftentimes so are we.Anomalisa is an oddity. An animated film that takes full advantage of its medium to tell a sad little story about the loneliness of humans and how we're often drowned in the noise of simply existing. Powerful stuff."
" Very emotional, somber and honest
",2020-01-08 00:00:00,10,"Charlie Kaufman is a writer who is able to delve into certain aspects of humanity in ways that other writers don't. All of his films take very honest glimpses into the human psyche and provide the viewer with a unique experience. Anomalisa is no different.I found this film to be extremely emotional. As someone who is not the happiest with their life, I found the main character relatable. He sees everyone the same and this film explores whether or not seeing the world in a different lens is possible.The movie really twists the nerves in a way that may be unpleasant. Kaufman has a way of reaching into the viewer's soul and making them reflect on their own life. When watching Anomalisa, I found that a lot of the film connected with me on an emotional level. And I found lots to admire technically, as well. Stop-motion is such a brilliant choice to bring this story to life, and I'm not sure if the story would have been as impactful otherwise.Overall, this is a marvelous film that is guaranteed to make the viewer feel something, even if it isn't all together a good feeling."
" Technically, um, interesting: aesthetically atrocious.
",2019-12-28 00:00:00,1,"A stop-frame animation of a motivational-author-speaker's one night stand in a Cincinnati hotel. Which has no consequences whatever.Howard Hughes' Spruce Goose, the biggest piston-engined plane ever built was a technical marvel but it just didn't fly. Nor does this film. There are three cognitive dissonances from the start:1. The female characters all have an obviously male (Tom Noonan) voice, deeper than the main character's (David Thewlis). For the first half hour I thought there was a significant gay/transexual theme; I was wrong, though that would have at least been more interesting than the sordid tale here..
2. All the puppets appear to be wearing invisible glasses. Nope; they're just not quite right.
3. All the supporting characters have the same (white) face (and voice}. Confused? you will be.None of these glaring problems - anomalies, if you like - is addressed in any way; it's like the 'Being John Malkovich' poster made into a cartoon, which makes me think it comes down to a budget constraint. Perhaps if the script had been filmed with live actors, and not stop-frame (CGI?) animation that takes immense masturb&tory joy in depicting, at tedious length, puppet s&x, ablutions, walking, smoking, drinking, etc, there might have been more money available to hire the edit room for longer and make a fifteen-minute short out of the miles of footage presented here. That, or write a script with any meaning. This is mediocre high school stuff.Technically, it's very clever. But it's like watching the same twee advertisement for two hours."
" Incredible
",2019-11-13 00:00:00,10,What can I say about this film? It's the best film of its year and unsuccessfully walked away with no awards. Kaufman is a gifted writer and he once again crafts an amazing film. The film is odd and will test the patience of the casual film-goer. I can't recommend this highly enough and I only hope the cult film finds a new audience as it ages.
" Telling for depression but not for them who is in that condition
",2019-11-01 00:00:00,8,I am not totally a professional of psychology but a student and surely I am now in that condition so I can feel them. The core concept of depression is same but associate may be differ. The movie Anomalisa though shows up some of the core concept but associate are bad. A depressed person can easily get bored as their life is already boring.
" it's...another experience.
",2019-10-16 00:00:00,7,"It's hard to figure out what you want to say about this movie which I suppose it testimony to its originality.I think I'll keep it simple and say that this is a depiction of two vulnerable people finding a momentary but rather tragic solace in each other.By turns poignant, painful, intriguing haunting and sickly funny, the quiet, unassuming tone of this movie with that disquieting atmosphere of hotels quite wonderfully evoked.The animation aspect...I suppose it sort of needs to be animated for a few things they do, I can't help but think I missed some crucial points. They do some interesting things but I'm not sure why.I wouldn't call this a masterpiece but I admire sincere attempts to make something genuinely distinct and different that tells a sincere emotional story. Especially in animation.See it as an experience but don't put too much pressure on it."
" Pros and cons
",2019-10-01 00:00:00,5,"Pros:
Very cool visual and audible gimmick with the protagonist's psychological condition
Can be deeply emotional, deep themes of love, control and suffering
Solid voicework
Fairly good animation, especially on facesCons:
Very slow story, takes a while to start and end
Character design is off, the line across everyone's face throws me off
Unsatisfying ending, wish it was dynamicBest part: conference speech, emotional and easy to empathize with the guy
Worst part: ending, sucked and he didn't learn anything or get any release"
" Unique and disconcerting
",2019-09-12 00:00:00,7,"Off the bat, let me say that I consider Charlie Kaufman to be an artistic genius. We need more like him. While this is not as great as some of his other projects, it is still a uniquely fascinating and pretty darn weird film. Anomalisa is an adult romantic dramedy that for some reason is filmed using an animation process. I was not entirely sure what kind, but it appears stop motion with puppets was the main thing. There are some very strange artistic choices made in this flick, starting with that. Another is using the same actor (Tom Noonan) to do voices for almost all of the characters, both male and female (that was plenty disconcerting) and using the same basic face for a huge percentage of the characters. Huh? Also the characters faces have weird lines/edges in them, and can come apart, for no good reason that I could see.So it is strange and will throw the viewer off center, but there are reasons for everything. It also seems like it could be done as a stage play, because most of the scenes take place in a hotel room. The story concerns an Englishman named Michael Stone, a famous expert on customer service, who goes to Cincinnati to give a talk. Stone is unhappy in his marriage and emotionally adrift. He reaches out to an old flame, and ends up getting into a romantic situation with another character. I won't give more of the plot away, but this is not the kind of thing that is usually performed by stop-motion puppets. I can't say I loved it, but it has its own unique character, that is for sure."
" Grim realism, imaginatively rendered
",2019-09-04 00:00:00,7,"A depressed man has an affair; which briefly cheers him up, and actually really does make his temporary partner happy, but which fails to lift him from his overall state of misery. It seems to be a strange story to tell with an animation, but Charlie Kaufman's film actually works; it also includes the most honest depiction of physical intimacy that I have ever seen in a film. Overall, it's not exactly a bundle of laughs, precisely because it offers no fantasy solutions. But perhaps it's the nature of its subject matter that it so successfully manages to probe the heart of human existence in spite of a medium that cannot fully convey the range of human expressiveness manifested by those fortunate not to be depressed."
" Worth it
",2019-08-20 00:00:00,7,"Well, it's not easy to write something about this movie. Is it distressing? Yes. Is it boring? Yes. The reason I give it a positive rate is that they chose to slap in your face what a human mind can be, and what relationships can be - for the bad, but also, in a small part, for the good. This choice is very bold, and certainly does its job. I spent 90 minutes in distress, but sometimes they're worth it."
" Stunning and different
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,10,"This is an amazing film. When I watched the trailer I thought it would be a simple and beautiful love story, my expectations were surprisingly subverted. I couldn't believe how good this film was, with the amazing story and just the complete realism with how characters act even tho they're supposed to be all the same. All I can say is just watch it you won't be disappointed."
" beautifully made
",2019-04-30 00:00:00,8,A beautiful movie. Shot and made David and jennifer do a nice ce job with the voice acting and other additional voices being it to life. I would say there are parts that taoe a darker turn and made me question my own reality. Though that just adds to this film being even better adding more depth. The story and characters and the subtle hints to the underlaying story below the surface make this a well recommended film from me 8/10
" Anomalisa
",2019-04-12 00:00:00,8,"A look at one man's mid-life crisis ignited by boredom and annoying of American life, played thru mechanical-human-puppets. Very unique and stylish visuals with an important contemporary message."
" the void in our lives
",2018-12-04 00:00:00,8,"Having written ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation"" and then directed ""Synecdoche, New York"", Charlie Kaufman then directed the stop-motion Academy Award-nominated feature ""Anomalisa"". It's basically a look at how the modern world leaves people isolated and numb, as the dispassionate protagonist (voiced by David Thewlis) regards everyone as the same person until he meets a young woman (voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh) in a hotel. Some of what the protagonist does looks questionable, but what's a man supposed to do when his life feels empty?I wouldn't call the movie a masterpiece, but it's still an unusual piece of work, with the animation creating a realistic feel for the characters both physically and emotionally. It's probably the most philosophical animated feature that I've ever seen.I recommend it both for the animation and the study of the characters. It's clear that they put a lot of effort into this movie. Good one."
" Essential movie to watch
",2018-10-29 00:00:00,9,It was sso real!!! Sometimes.. . More than real. The acting details of those puppets overcome the real acting. Are we humans going to be just some lifeless masked creatures someday? Overall it was amazing!
" Wow
",2018-10-08 00:00:00,9,"This movie changed my life, and I hope it changes yours too."
" A stop-motion film that has more to it than most modern live-action movies.
",2018-10-07 00:00:00,10,"Anomalisa is a deeply affecting comedy-drama that gives depression-awareness a voice comparable to BoJack Horseman's exploration of mental health: except this one is a feature film and it's adapted from a radio-play by Charlie Kaufman, America's best currently-working screenwriter. Anomalisa is what American animation's been trying to achieve for years: tell a story that's shot like a live-action drama but done with stop-motion puppets resembling inner anxieties about ourselves and a longing to find something beautiful we can find and latch onto and never let go.Watching this film is an out-of-body experience not unlike the films of David Lynch or Stanley Kubrick except Anomalisa does it in a very different way to those filmmakers: it's an out-of-body examination of ourselves as people struggling to get by with our day-to-day way of living, all told from the perspective of life-like puppets that look identical to one another (mostly), and protagonist Michael gives us a very honest look into what loneliness can really be like when you see EVERYONE as the same person except for Lisa. Kaufman knew that stop-motion would be the best way to tell this well-realized but confronting story on the human condition, and it's equal parts moving and creepy when the story digs deeper into the world's character (and even directly shows that the character's faces are detachable things). That scene where Michael looks at himself in the bathroom-mirror is a great example of WHY this was done in stop-motion, as opposed to a live-action thingy done with computer-trickery to help convey the message. Also the voice-acting is fantastic; probably the best I've ever heard for an animated movie (David Thewlis is great, as is Tom Noonan and Jennifer Jason Leigh: and they're the only three actors in it).Anomalisa is an other-worldly experience in cinema, and one of the most important ones for the 2010s: quite easily. If you love animation but want to see something new in the medium, this is the film for you. It's Kaufman at his best and most unconventional.Anomalisa gets 5/5 stars."
" Awesome
",2018-10-04 00:00:00,9,"Beautifully animated, smartly written, awesomely directed, cleverly shot and so haunting. Watch this. It's really great."
" A very real movie
",2018-09-19 00:00:00,9,It has incredibly natural dialogue and characters. It describes the main character's mental condition so accurately that he becomes this unlikable but very relatable person for us. The stop-motion animation is flawless and there's full nudity in it which I've never seen before lol.It's about a famous motivational speaker's night before a speech and what he goes through in his head during his mid-life crisis.
" Depressing, weird, disturbing, and creepy... For all the wrong reasons.
",2018-08-08 00:00:00,3,"Anomalisa is a dreary and pretentious art piece about a wealthy, neurotic, middle aged limey (who is married) who preys upon and manipulates a woman much younger than him. The filmmakers expect us to feel sympathy for this delusional weirdo (in which he thinks all people except this young woman) are the same person. At the conclusion of the film I ended up hating the main character, felt really unnerved by the creepy animation and that uncomfortable sex scene, and felt completely empty because the film just left me with a very bad taste in my mouth. The film was marketed as moving and touching but incidentally was a needlessly stupid pity party about one crazy old guy's first world problems and unhealthy libido. Skip it."
" Unconventional and Fascinating
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,8,"Michael (voiced by David Thewlis) is a middle-aged, upper-middle class family man travelling to Cincinnati to deliver a corporate lecture on customer service. While there, he reacquaints with an ex-lover who was heartbroken by their breakup and then shows interest in another young woman whom he meets at the hotel. ""Anomalisa"" is a stop-motion animated film.The film begins with some questions. One is, why are all the characters' faces split in the middle? Another is, why are all the women's voices (except one) voiced by a man? (In fact, Tom Noonan voices all the men as well except Michael.)The answer to the first question takes time after the film's conclusion but the second is more easily answered during a breakfast scene near the movie's end.The highlight - and a big one at that - is a romantic conversation scene followed by a sex scene. The sex scene is warm, loving, and compassionate. This is a rarity as sex scenes in most modern films are cheap, vulgar, and casual. The romantic scene that precedes it is even more compelling.Lisa (voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh) could easily represent many modern young women (and perhaps young men too) who seem to find every reason possible to believe that they are ""not good enough"". Lisa measures herself according to the more superficial societal standards of looks, career success, education level, and perceived intelligence. In this powerful scene, Michael is easily able to see Lisa's greatness despite her low self-esteem.As a character study, Michael could be called a sex/love addict or someone with pathological intimacy issues. This is evidenced in an earlier scene with an ex-lover and further exposed throughout the movie.There is an implication that much of Michael's misery comes from the corporatization of our modern world - something he helped create. The film could have been even more fascinating if it dealt further with this theme.However, it remains above par and how could it not be? The screenplay is by the brilliant Charlie Kaufman who also co-directed with Duke Johnson. As the writer of such gems as ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", his latest could only be equally unusual in a fascinating way. Likewise, Thewlis and Leigh are very powerful in their roles."
" Original idea, which is simply... true
",2018-06-12 00:00:00,10,"OK, first about the play with the words: Anomalisa = Anomalia + Lisa, but there is another jungian reference here: ANIMA. Anima is the image of the ideal woman in every man's subcosciousness. Whenever we meet even the tiniest fragment of Anima in a real-life woman, we feel an immediate attraction, whether it is a gesture, or the sound of her voice... However, when we realize that the woman is still not Anima, well... 10 points for the genuine basic idea!"
" The remarkable stop-motion is juxtaposed by the very realistic writing.
",2018-05-12 00:00:00,6,"Kaufman's subtle quirky comedy is on fine form here, the strangeness of the world and its inhabitants amplified by the feature's remarkable stop-motion aesthetic yet juxtaposed by its realistic writing and performances. So is his knack for portraying genuine human emotion, with a heavy melancholy beginning to seep in rather quickly. 'Anomalisa (2016)' is wonderfully made in every aspect and is a deliriously human picture, an honest portrayal that is rare to see in any form of media. It never takes the easy route - featuring perhaps the most realistic and unflinching sex scene I've ever seen on film - but its message does get a little muddled along the way. 6/10"
" Anomalisa Claymation
",2018-04-24 00:00:00,10,"The Claymation character 'Michael Stone' is on a business trip to deliver a speech on customer service, he meets a woman and they find an emotional connection.This is a unique animated film, the themes being explored are loneliness, isolation, vulnerabilities, social awkwardness, and fear of rejection.This is really fascinating film. 
There are some deep messages.
It's about as perfect as you can imagine.
You won't watch anything like it!This is one of the easiest maximum scored I've ever awarded."
" Apt depiction of human suffering
",2018-03-19 00:00:00,10,"This film couldn't be made with live action because it's *too* real. Okay, the identical faces and voices aside, Anomalisa truly grasps what we all seek (and many of us achieve)-the alleviation of our personal suffering. Many of the previous comments chide the depiction of comfortable first-world problems, but in any social strata of humanity, our relationships with others are the source of much of the pain and distance we feel from our fellow man. Another Kaufman masterpiece. And kudos to the filmmakers and animators for the most realistic depiction of intimacy I've scene on film."
" An interesting movie.
",2018-03-09 00:00:00,7,"This is a well-made and entertaining movie. Animation - This is probably the best thing about this movie. It could easily have been live-action but the decision was made to have it animated. it is done incredibly well and is worth watching just to witness the claymation marvel. Everything looks so realistic. Audio - There are only 3 voice actors which was probably to serve some kind of point I didn't get but either way it was annoying. Other than that, the sound design was pretty good except for a few bits where the mouth movements aren't quite right. Plot - The plot has a lot of potential. Though this is more of a slice-of-life story, it was almost interesting. There is a dream sequence that had so much going for it until it was revealed to be a dream sequence. The part of the movie that everything else seemed to be building up to didn't happen, and everything after that is so random and stupid. This movie could've been amazing if it wasn't for the route it could've taken. Though this movie is incredibly made and has potential, I probably wouldn't recommend it. It moves really slow and has a lot of awkward scenes."
" Very Unique, but Had More Potential,
",2018-02-28 00:00:00,8,"Anomalisa is a great movie with a well developed plot and a spectacular trio of voice actors. It is entirely made by clay, but there is nothing about the film that insisted on it being animated, it easily could have been live action. Making it claymation created a unique project that made is feel as if we were taking in to another world, it is a little uneasy, and yet very familar. Charlie Kaufman manages to create some truly groundbreaking animation that you will never see in any previous cartoons. I did feel that it had more potential than what it delivered, the biggest issue for me was that Michael is a very unlikeable character. It is difficult to sympathise with him and the journey he goes on, he is self destructive and all the heartache that comes his way is deserved. The cast is terrific, David Thewlis really shines as Michael, adding so much depth and passion in to the part that it is difficult to imagine he was just sitting in a recording studio. Jennifer Jason Leigh also brings so much passion to the film as Lisa, and Tom Noonan as Everyone Else, actual credit, is terrific, he adds something new to every character, while using his own voice. Very different. Unique and beautifully animated, Anomalisa is certainly worth the watch if you are looking for a good drama or animation."
" Waste of time
",2018-02-22 00:00:00,1,"Fortunately I was able to cut through this unusual, but crappy film, by fast forwarding through the dullest of dialogs. Don't waste your time on this so-called animated waste."
" worthy but unfulfilling
",2018-02-11 00:00:00,6,"Michael is a customer service guru on jaunt in a nondescript hotel. He is jaded and misanthropic, everyone around him seems to get on his nerves. And these is a sameness about them... The ennui is wonderfully conveyed, and the process of using puppets in stop-motion adds to the sense of non-belonging and dislocation. Michael's dark soul is complemented by Lisa and her zest for life. The burgeoning relationship is both awkward and sweet, but, we sense, ultimately doomed. The sense of a man in middle-age crisis, of people living compartmentalised lives, is fully conveyed. There is some nice humour and pathos. But ultimately nothing much changes for Michael or Lisa, and any greater insight to life's many questions is not forthcoming. Take away the puppets and the process, and you are left with a film that says not very much at all."
" More human than you might expect
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,8,"I knew very little about this film: Charlie Kaufman, animated...that was about it. Interestingly enough, it was one of the more human films that I've seen lately. Even though the characters were created from 3D printers. I could not look away, and I found each little moment to be intriguing and poignant. It was not a perfect piece - more play than movie, a bit light on plot - bit it was worth seeing (and revisiting), for sure."
" Insightful writing and oversimplified (if expert) animation
",2017-12-23 00:00:00,7,"Anomalisa (2015) I was drawn to this because of the great writer, Charlie Kaufman (Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine, Being John Malkovich). Here was a story about an ordinary man who goes to Ohio (an ordinary place) on travel and things go very slightly strange.
 The fact this is an animated film took me by surprise. And I stayed with it, wondering over and over how it helped to have it animated. Here is a story about a subtle psychological crisis, and the real reactions and facial expressions of the main character (and others) seemed to me to be totally important. And here they were dumbed down to archetypes and simplifications. Oh, I know, the animators tried for subtlety but I'm not going to praise a film for being ""really close"" to the actual thing. Not with the actual thing would be better.
 However, there are elements to the film that eventually seem to require animation (though even this isn't convincing, I'll say right away). For one thing, nearly everyone's voice is the same kind of ordinary man's voice, even women. That might have been handled with dubbing. Then there are some cracks in the facade of realism that rely on animation, like people's faces have seams (or in one case coming apart). I think there might be ways to do this otherwise, but it's fine animated, too.
 But wait-what about this writing that I was so drawn to? Well, it's good. It's like seeing a lesser David Mamet play, knowing it's good but knowing there are some really amazing examples elsewhere. So I watched and listened and the crisis, which is of the most ordinary kind, unfolds and turns out to be something unfinished and unsatisfying.
 So, lots of hesitations here. A film with great potential. And maybe people who prefer (!) the nature of detached observation that the animation forces on is, and the style of it all, might get deeper in than I could."
" Looks great, is great.
",2017-12-21 00:00:00,9,"Very realistic, almost depressing. Good animation, liked the cinematography, yet I don't like the idea of watching it again."
" A very bad movie
",2017-11-11 00:00:00,1,"I am not a en expert, but I honestly found this clip a total waste of my time. Senseless things, not recommended. If you are the kind of people that expects a movie to give you something, laugh, sex, fun, anything, you just won't get it from this one. Not at all. It really took time from my life and gave nothing back, this one has nothing for real."
" Only the voice you love is ""different""
",2017-10-19 00:00:00,10,"Many people couldn't stand the voice of this movie, for it's been so monotone and doesn't match the characters at all. However, it's a genius sacrifice to express the theme and I'm sure many people were touched by this extraordinary work. ..........Spoiler: My friends and I have split views on whether Lisa ever exists or not..........The fissures on the Japanese doll could be a symbol of Lisa's scar..........So there are two ways to interpret the movie, either way is sad, he cannot hear the ""right"" voice anymore."
" Another Kaufman masterpiece
",2017-09-06 00:00:00,9,"While an adult stop-motion drama about a midlife crisis and mental illness may sound mundane as a concept, this is quite possibly Kaufman's sharpest and most absorbing film yet. Charlie Kaufman has already proved himself to be one of the smartest, most creative visionary directors/writers working today. He has yet to make an unoriginal film even as his vibrant style stretches over a career spanning 40 years. Anomalisa is certainly Kaufman's tamest work when compared to the outlandish concepts of Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, but it is also one of his most engaging. A grounded perception of mental illness affecting a lonely, middle-aged man in the centre of a richly-detailed, yet maddening, world. The concept will never sound as appealing as it really is, but upon viewing, the film's subtle messages on love and identity will surely resonate with any viewer, no matter their age. Even with an ending that hints upon a concept that I wish was further explored, Anomalisa expresses it's thought-provoking story through detailed character interactions, a wry script and brilliant voice performances from the extremely limited cast that had me daydreaming of the film's beauty long after watching."
" For anyone who feels empty inside...
",2017-09-02 00:00:00,10,"Suitably nihilistic for Kaufman but with a much more straightforward presentation than his other films and therefore more accessible to a more casual audience.Tha animation is some of the best I have ever witnessed.Its a story of loneliness, despite being surrounded by people, and personal depression which will resonate with anyone who has ever felt an emptiness inside them."
" Intellectually stimulating and a pleasure for your eyes and ears
",2017-08-31 00:00:00,8,"I'd go that far as too say that ANOMALISA is almost as dense and multi layered as the E.T.A. Hoffmann classical story DER SANDMANN, also including the puppet as a major metaphorical figure, the one Sigmund Freud used to explain the Uncanny in his prominent essay. The film can be read as a story about individuality and individualism in our times and/or about a mean psychosis coming alive and/or male and female sexual longings and/or a typical mid-life crisis of a semi-famous man realizing how detached he feels to his entire life and/or a desperate, sincere prayer to a God perceived as the ultimate puppet master doubled in the puppets within the story and double doubled within the dreams of the puppets within the story etc. ANOMALISA is surely a complex little film, but luckily at the same time told very straight forwardly and laid back, almost relaxed, which makes it easy to watch it through — and just beautifully animated from the puppet faces to the lightning choreographies within the virtual, shoe-box like spaces. Sometimes it is funny and sometimes dramatically sad, often it is both at the same time. Almost always it is intellectually stimulating and a pleasure for your eyes and ears."
" Beautifully and hauntingly real
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,9,"In my reviews, I usually critique and obsess over story-line, cinematography, production design, and acting. And although I have good things to say about the voice acting and the beautiful (and to be honest, quite haunting) stop-motion, this review will be my anomaly. Because the characters in this movie deserve their own standing ovation. I watched Anomalisa not knowing what to expect, having never seen anything written by Charlie Kaufman before (I apologize to the hardcore Kaufman fans, but I promise after Anomalisa, it'll be hard to keep me away).And so I sat there while the movie folded out in front of me--It was so simple. Yet the entire time, I was taken aback at how REAL the characters were. Every little thing they said, every little thing they did, and every little thing they went through, I found it so easy to sympathize and relate to these characters who, just minutes before the movie started, had meant absolutely nothing to me. And for me, that was magical.I usually fall in love with the story of a movie. But here, the characters WERE the story. And they really weren't that special at all. But that's what made them the most beautiful."
" I have been thinking about it for a week now
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,6,"Despite me watching 5 airing TV series and 2 completed ones, seeing 3 movies and played one story-driven video game, I am still thinking about Anomalisa week after seeing it and all this other stuff. Keeping the rating at 5/10 has been an uncertainty for me, but I have now decided to call it a 6/10 work. Anomalisa is definitely thought-provoking, unique and even memorable experience. The execution is very different from anything that's been done before. It feels heavy on substance even though it rides with the power of a single sentence. Some would go as far as calling this a masterpiece. Some think it has nothing to offer. Should have been 40 minutes long short film instead. I will just say this: is not necessarily a must watch, but it is a must try."
" Heartwarming and with lovely stop motion
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,9,"Pure cinematic magic. Finely tuned. Lovely stop motion animations. Written and co- directed by Charlie Kaufman, it's an extraordinary vision. Based on a play by Kaufman - starring David Thewlis, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Tom Noon, who also voice the movie - ""Anomalisa"" (2015) is a bittersweet and humorous depiction of the loneliness and mundanity of life. In some ways, it feels more real than life itself."
" A for Anomalisa
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,9,"Acclaimed Writer-Director Charlie Kaufman's films might not be for everyone, and they are an acquired taste; but one thing for sure is that Kaufman is an anomaly in so many filmmaking ways. Kaufman goes for the stop-motion animation in his movie ""Anomalisa"", which he co-directed with animation Director Duke Johnson. Anomalisa's protagonist is Michael Stone, a middle-aged motivational business speaker & author who travels to Cincinnati for a gig as a keynote speaker at a conference. Stone finds people and life in general very monotonous and with much sameness. But things go anomalistic when he meets Lisa, a depressed telemarketing representative who is attending the conference. Michael sees Lisa as a vibrant, standout woman and falls for her. His ""hands of Stone"" even get in Lisa's private parts. OK, that is enough. I will let you figure it out. But I do highly recommend to visit this eccentric, visionary film that had me quite engaged throughout its narrative. There is spectacular voice work from David Thewlis who voices Stone, Jennifer Jason-Leigh who voices Lisa, and Tom Noonan who voices everyone else. The animation was divine, and the score was right on. Kaufman's screenplay was a simplistic but original tour-de-force. And Johnson and him directed the hell out of ""Anomalisa"". Anomalisa! Anomalisa! Men have loved you!!! Hope women love it too, because it is in motion as a ""must see"" stop-motion animation treat. ***** Excellent"
" One.
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,7,"The elements used to portray a pretty complex idea, came together quite artistically in this film, however, somehow, it still falls kind of short of being as poignant as it was perhaps meant to.Creatively, Anomalisa is spot on, and it is easy to see that thought went into putting all the pieces together to bring an idea to life. Sadly though, apart from it being not as moving as it could be, many scenes felt incredibly stretched out, which made the film feel even longer than it already felt.Though I give this film a 6.9/10, I do understand the acclaim it has received. It didn't quite reach out to me the way it was supposed to, but honestly, given the artistic integrity this film holds, I see how it could've hit home for anyone else.The praise and Oscar Nomination are well founded. The idea is fresh and well designed, however, the execution though good, maybe could've been better, or wasn't good enough, but also, was very smart."
" Strangely Captivating
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,7,"I knew nothing about Anomalisa ahead of time. The first thing I had to figure out once the film started was why are all the animated characters except two were using the same voice. Once I got beyond that, I just watched in a kind of odd, mesmerized state.Nothing much happens for about the first 20 minutes. It is Michael Stone; a writer and motivational speaker, checking into a hotel in Cincinnati where he is to lecture at a conference the next day. He is a man who no longer has feelings for his wife, and has other serious personal problems. That evening he meets a couple of women who are there for the conference, know who he is and are subsequently infatuated by him. The three have drinks together at the hotel bar which leads to an overnight stay in his room by one of the women.For a short few hours Michael Stone truly believes he is in love with the woman, Lisa. He thinks his loneliness is over. But as he and the lady eat breakfast the next morning, he discovers that he is annoyed by some of her habits and just as quickly as he fell in love, he falls out of love. He will return home to the wife he no longer loves, and his son, his life unchanged.I think the unusual, stop-motion animation make it an interesting movie. I do not think the plot alone would make it a good movie and it is a good movie."
" Kaufman you have Done it Again!
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,10,"Anomalisa is a beautifully executed piece of art. From the great Charlie Kaufman brings us a fantastic story, with pronominal characters, and exceptional animation. I honestly can't do this movie justice. All I can really say much more other then see this film as soon as you can!10/10"
" Charlie Kaufman's writing hits all the right notes
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,9,"The only other experience I have had with Charlie Kaufman comes from one of my favorite films of all time - Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind. In Anomalisa he also tries his hand at directing as well, to great effect to be honest. However, that's not what I want to talk about.The writing in Anomalisa, alongside its beautiful animation, is what makes the film so interesting. It's an exploration of the psyche of a man who is driven to his wit's end by the mundane nature of everyday life. It seems innocuous and certainly seems as though it may be difficult to make a movie out of it, but here is where Kaufman shines. His script allows for wonderful pacing. It capitalizes on silences in ways other scripts may be tempted to fill the silence with dialogue. This silence also allows his characters space to breathe and develop in the audience's eyes. He knows the backstory to these characters, the audience doesn't, so the difficulty comes at how to get that across without too much exposition. Kaufman does this by focusing on Michael Stone's loneliness and gradually drawing in details about his personal life, slowly transforming how the audience sees him throughout the course of the picture. It really is a wonderful character study of how mundanity takes its toll on our lives, and it is most certainly worth your time."
" alienation made beautiful
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,9,"There are films that linger with you like a second itchy skin for days and weeks. It's been a year now since I saw Anomalisa and its shadow still lingers with me. It's telling the brutal fall of us all when the loneliness that we wear like a second skin sheds away with each infatuation, only to cover us again thicker with each disillusionment. Because not everyone is lucky enough to find ""the only other person in the world"". I love Charlie Kaufman, and Anomalisa is one of his best, most gentle and brutal story."
" Anomalies
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,5,"Bored and lonely, a motivational speaker is drawn towards a young woman at his hotel with a unique voice in this animated drama from the pen of Charlie Kaufman. As per Kaufman's earlier works, the film tackles issues of personal identity, alienation and desperation, and while his self-centred protagonist here is hard to warm to, it is easy to relate to his desire for something more in life. The irony at hand also strikes a chord as he is hardly motivated despite his career and as he teaches businesses how to interact with employees and customers when he is unable to relate to everyone he meets himself. Clocking in at close to 90 minutes though, the film runs incredibly long given the slim basic story and it is little surprise to learn that the movie was originally intended to be a short. The choice to have Tom Noonan voice every character (other than the two main ones) also backfires. Sure, him doing so makes Jennifer Jason Leigh's voice sound just as unique as the protagonist finds it to be when he first hears her; on the same account though, Noonan's voicing of all female characters opens the way for unintentional chuckles, only sounding more ridiculous when voicing a preteen son. A nightmarish sequence in the final 25 minutes almost propels the film in an entirely new and innovative direction, but it is merely misdirection as the film subsequently continues on same path as before. Perhaps that is the point of the film: that changing one's life is never as easy as it seems. This is a thought-provoking film for sure, but one's patience with it may vary."
" Surrealist Animation
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,8,"I haven't seen anything quite like this since I watched ""Eraserhead,"" The animation begins by looking as if everyone is a normal human being. Soon it becomes obvious that they have the same faces and the same voices, except for the main character. For a half hour this guy does everything a normal traveller does. He gets a cab ride from a tiresome cabbie, he checks into a hotel, he is taken to his room by a bellhop, and the room appears to be like every room we've ever seen. The difference, again, is that the faces and voices of everyone are the same. Michael Stone, our hero, orders room service. He then calls someone that he had a relationship with eleven year's previously, and he meets her for a drink. It's a disaster. She is a mess. He then hooks up with Lisa (Anomalisa) who is sort of dense and totally lacking in self esteem. He eventually has sex with her (quite graphic) and he is taken with her for the moment, but soon she begins to fade into a dull version of all the other people. The conclusion is interesting and heavy on the surrealism. He gets back to his home and strange things are going on. An unforgettable experience."
" Subtleness and Emotion in Puppetry
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,8,"Anomalisa is a film that encapsulates struggles like lost love, alienation, ennui and midlife crisis in a profound way not seen much in cinema nowadays. A visual distinction the film has is that there are no humans in this film. There are only puppets. And yet, the film invoked emotion on a level most live-action romances are unable to achieve. Anomalisa is an impeccable technical feat as well as a pure piece of introspective cinema, and one of the best films of 2016.The film follows depressed author Michael, voiced by a down-to-earth David Thewlis, as he travels to Cincinnati to showcase his newest book at a customer service convention. He has a wife and two kids, but decides to meet his ex, whom he keeps on seeing visions of. From the get go, we know something is wrong. Everybody else seems to be voiced by the same person, suggesting Michael's perception of everyone around him is concurrent with his own life --- a grind. He then meets a woman named Lisa, gracefully voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh. When her voice enters through the floodgate of the alienating voices by Tom Noonan, it really stands out. Lisa and Michael's relationship is one of the most touching and unconventional ones in recent filmic memory. Insecure or simply shy viewers will instantly relate to Lisa's character as she feels unwanted and unloved, all with a scar she conceals. Her gentle voice and humility makes her likable. Fuelled by the audience's familiarity with Michael's search for love and Carter Burwell's emotionally charged score, it is ultimately a relationship that will leave you with a happy tear in your eye.Anomalisa is also a great character study of the main protagonist --- Michael. His midlife crisis is layered and his self-contained personality not fully expressed. Maybe his endless conferences and customer service work made every voice sound the same to him too; this is one of a myriad of theories Anomalisa suggests about its main character. Later on in the film, the viewer can also gather a sense as to why he had that bad relationship in the past. The film unfolds and more is told about his state. Nuances that suggest Michael's distance from society are shown throughout the film. For example, he seems to sometimes ignore or go against whatever people are telling him (a taxi driver says try Cincinnati chilli or go to the zoo, and opportunities are right in front of him but he purposefully ignores them). I would not be surprised if this film was shown to a film studies class in the near future. Stop-motion is a delicate process and the results are usually charming. This film, however, strives for realism, something it inexplicably achieves. Not many animated features look as realistic as Anomalisa, and sometimes it felt like you are watching real people. Well, other than fluffy skin and the joins on the characters' faces, the latter of which can be a metaphor for our identities and personalities, as shown in one scene where Michael's face seemingly is falling off. Even the whole idea of a puppet society could be interpreted as our willingness to work, as shown through multiple plot points throughout. Overall, the film has an incredibly unique style. Thematically alike to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (Anomalisa co-director Charlie Kaufman's most famous screenplay), the film implies that imperfections are what makes us human, and that all of us should look for what makes someone special inside, and you'll notice that in the title. Two lost and lonely souls looking for love has not been executed this surreally well since 2003's Lost in Translation.Ending with a bittersweet and cryptic ending, one character has a symbolic revelation that leaves you utterly happy. After you are done with the film, you start valuing your own life and others a tad bit more. Anomalisa shows us the importance of knowing who you are but also to be responsible for your choices in life. Otherwise, they will still haunt you, physically and mentally. Charlie Kaufman & Duke Johnson crafted an emotional odyssey that explores some of the most important issues of the human condition while also delivering a beautiful love story. You will be contemplating one of the film's questions for ages: ""What is it to be alive""?"
" Kaufman engages the psyche instead of the mind in the much more simplistic ""Anomalisa""
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,8,"Charlie Kaufman is the world's foremost expert on the mind of the of lonely white male and ""Anomalisa"" might be his deepest foray into its recesses, yet somehow his most accessible.Considering the rest of Kaufman's catalog, ""Anomalisa"" is rather straightforward. Michael Stone (voiced by David Thewlis) is a customer service expert making a one-night visit to Cincinnati to give a talk. He's clearly lonely and unhappy in his marriage and thinking about reconnecting with an ex who lives there. Eventually he meets Lisa (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and with her the promise of genuine love, connection and purpose.The twist on this rather mundane plot is that everyone Michael meets, aside from Lisa, looks and sounds the same (they're all voiced by Tom Noonan, men and women characters alike). In fact, Michael is staying at the Fregoli Hotel, a reference to the rare disorder in which a person holds the paranoid delusion that everyone they encounter is the same person in disguise. Therein lies the purpose of using stop-motion animation, that and the bigger metaphor of what makes us humans and not all identical machines.So while ""Anomalisa"" might be a good 90-minute ""Intro to Charlie Kaufman"" course, the existentialism and most notably the melancholy are taken to the next level. Michael is a brooding sad sack, a tough character to relate to because he clearly takes everything in his life for granted. Of course his profession is a sad bit of irony; he makes a living telling people the best way to make other people feel special, when no one seems special to him. Except Lisa, hence the film's title.Lisa is a quiet, awkward woman with a terrible self image, yet to Michael, just the fact that she has a different voice rings clear. She is amazing and unique to him, yet to the objective person, she's terribly ordinary, thus confounding the true nature of Michael's delusion.For an animated film, Kaufman and co-director Duke Johnson create a lot of deeply human moments and tap into a lot of what makes us tick. They put a ton of care into the film's most intimate moments that you forget everything is made of clay more or less. Considering it's adapted from a radio play Kaufman wrote about 10 years prior, Kaufman and Johnson breathe quite a bit of visual life into the story.""Anomalisa"" has a slow pace to it, but it echoes the mundane hell Michael perceives himself to be in. After so many films that engage with you intellectually, Kaufman tries to engage with the psyche and it makes for a less entertaining but more earnest viewing experience.The ideas and message of ""Anomalisa"" are more simplistic than profound, so the emotional resonance is fairly minimal compared to the epiphanies that Kaufman has delivered in the past. Basically, it wouldn't be a surprise if this was your favorite or most disappointing Kaufman film. The cerebral efforts are definitely the more exciting, but there's a subdued brilliance to ""Anomalisa"" that I expect will grow my admiration over time.~Steven CThanks for reading!

" The comedy is very much of each and more if it is black
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,3,"The first thing I have to say is that despite being short, I have become long. He could not wait to see if it was over. The scriptwriter and director is very special, clear and either you like or you do not like anything. Personally, I do not like any of his films since I do not share his humor. For a long time, I did not understand what I was telling and only when I read the argument did I understand what I wanted to say and I think there is no worse thing for a director, and I, who direct short films, I know, do not understand what Is meant.Spoiler:I've always said that in the animation, making beautiful plans is extremely simple, you just have to think about them, although many people say they do not need to, but this is an audiovisual mute, but we take away the visual part and that's it. In this case as is typical, we do not have the camera. That if you have a nice picture. We can not qualify the actors, since they do not exist, I do not mean with this that I do not like animation, quite the opposite, but I think all the gestures of an actor, here they are not. I have a lot of sex scene, I do not know why he put it all, was it lacking? I do not know, maybe it's because I've bored"
