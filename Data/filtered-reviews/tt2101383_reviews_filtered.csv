" Relaxing with unspoken emotions but will be boring for many
",2021-03-23 00:00:00,5,"What I liked: Relaxing, beautiful quotes, the cinematography, unspoken touching emotions, Christian BaleWhat I didn't like: Many unnecessary scenes/ it's exhausting to watch it all at one time, it needs to be divided or play it in the background while doing something elseDon't watch it if you are seeking a plot based or a good dialogue movie, it feels like a silent movie but it may make you feel something ( according to your mood)
But generally I'm not a big fan of Malick's style"
" Transportation to my mind's eye
",2021-03-05 00:00:00,8,"What a weird mindset to be in, after a break-up of 12 years, sitting on your couch for the hundreth time on a Friday night - let's see what this movie is about - finding yourself in complete awe of how great they've captured the inside of your head on a movie screen.
Never before been into artsy films, always thought them way too weird, and now, in a mind blow, this was just the right kind of weird. And I got it and there was a story and I could relate on so many levels and to so many characters.
It's so odd to find yourself in a random movie. Being moved into a space where you don't know how to handle yourself.
Guess I'll go to sleep now."
" Pure self-indulgence
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,2,To make a movie as self-indulgent as this requires total disconnect with outside world on the part of the film maker. Useful only for clinical study of solipsism.
" I think I just went to film school
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,6,Quite possibly the most unconventional film I have ever watched all the way through. Definitely not what I signed on for. I was drawn in by the cast and director. I know it wasn't poorly made. I'm just not sure what to make of it.
" LA nuit americaine (""Knight for day"")
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,1,"Rick (played by Christian Bale) doesn't seem to have any idea what's happening in his life or how to respond to it. He simply seems to wander around while people, particularly women, seem to be drawn to him. He never seems to learn; he never seems to adapt; he never seems to do much of anything.There are a few moments here were things seem almost poetic (for want of a better word). But they are few and far between and they're not in any way affecting. In fact, the whole thing just washes over you without leaving much impression.Perhaps the joke here is that Terrence Malick has written a poor screenplay about a screenwriter who seems likely to be unable to write anything other than a poor screenplay? So at least Mr Malick is writing about what he knows.Or is Rick some sort of Messiah? The oblique reference to a cup that he would rather not be presented with? The adoring women who fawn on him? His whole life presented as a sort of (living) pieta? That's probably a stretch far too far, but he is played by an actor with the given name of ""Christian""."
" A View Into the Anthropocene
",2020-11-26 00:00:00,10,"The nature of the view (sight), of awareness, and the inimitable hazard of speech to experience of satisfaction in life, are manifestly cerebral concerns in Knight of Cups. The opening sequences of man, desert, car, memory (home movies), advertising fetish, and the Aurora Borealis as seen from the ISS, with John Gielgud and Charles Laughton reciting the Pilgrim's Progress to Ralph Von Williams set a threshold for the character of Rick to discover that the farther than man's wealth progresses, the more hopelessly distracted he becomes by the effects of his own artifice, and how desperately he requires a nature to make possible his hedonistic excess, and to redeem him of it. This is a survey of the pleasures and the plight of rich men, who have fallen into extravagance far ahead of any experience which can prepare them for their privilege. Malick fashions this excess into a beautiful allegory for human life as a universal surplus. Whether Malick is aware, I'm not sure, but he says no matter what your lot in life you face an abundance is which your suffering is also your pleasure, with an emphasis on thr freedom wealth brings to indulge in the sensation of life's abundance and the tragic dread than attends life's pain and brevity, all roiling in a ""material"" world which we can now see, with the aid of the camera, appears in the verisimilitude of a dream. It's a magnificent and damning portrait of a once promusing future turned into a haunted present, and a cry to an impossible God to rectify the human condition while pointing towards a horrific future that will continue to emerge even as God never answers our call. We fear death and rejoice in the hedonistic moment with no one, nothing, to answer our prayers,not even ourselves. This angst becomes a beautiful agony in Lubeski's warlock's hands as time and again a divine serendipity plays out before the camera; I have never seen such good fortune in shots, it's as if fate demanded this movie be created against ever odd, and the editing and sound design create a tone poem that conveys a magnificence of an era that I treasure, and believe will be celebrated one hundred years from now, whether we encounter a utopia of convenience or stare back longingly from an ash heap of human destruction."
" A trailer for a trailer
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,2,"I used to like Terence Mallick. Then I doubted his work. Then I watched ""Song to Song"" and remembered how well Mallick can make movies. I looked forward to watch this movie. The main character wants to find a pearl. Is this pearl the child he has in the end of the movie? I don't know. If you don't like my review, be sure, that it has more meaning than the movie and is much shorter. There is almost no plot and the clean, safe, dry, very aesthetic though recordings of architecture and city scenes look so boring. Mallick couldn't film a garbage can with actual debris and trash inside if his life depended on it. It's nice to have HD shootings when they have purpose and beauty, with context and liquidity. These edges of buildings Mallick is transporting to the viewer are the real message. The minds of the characters are captivated inside triangles, sometimes maybe squares. Maybe that's what the director wants to tell us. That he made actual other movies that matter. And on top of it, it was made in L.A., where nature is only a fading image on the horizon while people pretend to be swimming in a real ocean when they can drown out the noises from the drug abuse and lost dreams from the parking lots. Anyway, there are lots of gold-digging prositutes in this movie, hanging around in every scene. Even for Mallick's standards too many. I still love him though."
" A wayward life
",2020-10-28 00:00:00,7,"This is often called Malick's movie of ennui, and I sort of agree with that label. I think it's more about the emptiness of materialism, though. It's funny. Malick's been making movies since the early 70s, and he made a single movie in Hollywood, this one, and it's about how life in the modern world is an empty spectacle of carnal delights that leads to nothing because it is a soulless exercise. I have the sneaking suspicion that Malick is not a fan of Hollywood. He probably much prefers Texas.So, it's obvious to me how Malick built this film. He had access to Christian Bale over the course of a few months a few days at a time, and he had access to a selection of other actors and actresses for a day or two here and there. Using his captured moment approach to filmmaking, he largely improvised a series of scenes with his actors, and then he spent a couple of years editing it all together. With the disconnected pieces he collected (none of the named actresses share a single scene, for instance), Malick assembled a story about a disconnected existence, and I think it works rather well. It's far from his best work, but it's an experiment that ends up having something interesting on its mind.Rick, Christian Bale, is a Hollywood producer who drifts through his life with little to no attachments. Pulling from Malick's own biography again, Rick is one of three brothers, one of whom committed suicide at 19. His surviving brother is a recovering drug addict while their father wonders how he went so wrong raising two young men so disconnected from him and their past. Rick moves from studio lot, barely participating in contract negotiations, to photo shoots, where he picks up a woman he met at a party, and parties. He collects and discards women without any real concern for who they are or what they might mean to him. Among them are his ex-wife, a young punk rocker chick, a stripper, and an attractive married woman. He never seems to connect with them, sharing moments of frivolity and sex along with the trademarked twirls in curtains that Malick had become so fond of, but they suddenly disappear from his life the second they bring up something serious.He doesn't want connections, and yet he's still unhappy. He has no material wants being well off, but the material he does collect ends up providing him with no real nourishment. The second he's offered something more, he's off to find another party to drift through and the woman never shows up again. He even ends up in a literal desert towards the end, bereft of any meaning to his life.All of this is told in Malick's dreamlike, handheld, Steadicam style. The pieces need stitching together with voiceover, another trademark of his, and so it seems to show off its seams to the world. So, I'm of the mind that it becomes an intentional choice to demonstrate the seams, knowing that they are there, by creating a story in editing about a life sewn together from disparate material pieces that can't come together into a cohesive whole because they end up demonstrating emptiness. In other words, I understand the movie's detractors but I simply don't agree with them. This may not be a masterpiece by Malick, but it's definitely intentionally doing something stylistically and thematically at the same time that end up complimentary.Ultimately, this kind of ends up as the opposite of To the Wonder. In the previous film, the main character, Neil, was largely a cipher and Marina was the main focus. Here, Rick is nearly silent like Neil, but his inner pain is still the focus. He's empty himself with little thoughts, but the women around him are material things to him, not real people. Their lack of development or time to shine on screen (Natalie Portman has what appears to be a heartbreaking moment late in the film that gets largely overlooked) is all because Rick himself is uninterested. He doesn't care about these women as living beings, just another thing for him to have and then toss away. His nearly empty apartment is another manifestation of his emptiness this way. It has classy objects, but no pictures of any kind. It could be a hotel room, and when some robbers break in and find nothing to steal, it highlights how Rick is nothing at his core.Interestingly, the movie ends with Rick leaving Hollywood and Los Angeles as an escape. Seriously, I think Malick hates the place. It seems rare to have a film made about the empty materialism of Hollywood and the film industry as well as the modern age, but Malick did it. It's a rough work that betrays its fractured production, but it's also intelligently assembled in the end. It certainly lacks a lot of the emotional punch of Malick's other films, but it's not really supposed to, I think."
" A look into an unsatisfied mind
",2020-10-08 00:00:00,9,"Completely mesmerizing and beautiful, I had so much fun discussing this film, the main theme of trying to find meaning is incredibly relatable, and the feeling of isolation in a sea of people is so incredibly poignant. Attempting to be satisfied within yourself is an everlasting struggle for all of us, and it is enlightening to see it portrayed in such a wonderful way. Unique and a complete feast for the eyes and the ears."
" A sublime Gesamtkunstwerk
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,10,"Knight of Cups exemplifies the concept of ""total artwork"" as a genuine, immersive experience of many sorts, sensual, emotional, spiritual having the profoundness of life. This multifaceted experience is created by a subtle combination of elements chosen with the most accurate sense of beauty : sceneries, gestures, voices, quotes, skies, living spaces, bodies, works of art, pieces of music, etc., continuing and perfecting the new filmic language inaugurated by The Tree of Life. The best film of the ""Trilogy of Love"" (the other two are To The Wonder and Song To Song), Knight of Cups is a mesmerizing masterpiece without any doubt and maybe a reinvention of cinema as an exercise in meditative thinking."
" captivating
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,10,"If you are looking for the story, it will bore you to death; otherwise, the visuals and sounds are captivating. After six movies, I can at least understand how to enjoy Terrence Malick's cinema. It is called poetic cinema for a reason. We don't read poems to find beginning-middle-end stories within it, we read them to make sure that our heart still can sense and get moved by the emotional appeal from words."
" Embarrassing watch.
",2020-05-12 00:00:00,4,"Nice vistas, decent (albeit pretty much constantly wide angle) camera, good music choices. But the inner monologues, dear Lord. Meditations over supposedly eternal question (father/son conflict and whatnot) executed in the most hollow, craven fashion imaginable. A constant string of dumb phrases, really.Additionally, while Bale's taking lonesome strolls through LA and Vegas works okay, human interactions look staged. Acting class, that's what one seems to attend. While everyone appears to be uncomfortable.They should have skipped all the voice parts and made better use of intertitles, and the movie would have been fine. As a wide open projection screen for your own imagination. But the way it's been made you just can't avoid the realization that the purpose driving it is a profoundly immature one. An emotional black hole, effectively, that's also lacking self-awareness. Painful."
" Masterpiece
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,10,"The existentialist quest for a real and better life. A sleeping man, lost in a fake world, in quest for his pearl in
order to wake him up, finding the true beauty of our existence, grace. This movie should be praised at. In such an individualistic world, it is pure hope.
The IMDb users note for this movie is such a letdown. Come on. What is this world we.re living in. Damn."
" Depression in a concrete jungle / rich people rebelling.
",2020-02-04 00:00:00,1,"Intended to be poetic art, buts ends up being about depression in a concrete jungle.If you imagine the lives of people who just grew up doing everything they're told, always looking at the ground, always wearing suits. This movie is about these people breaking out of the shell a little.All the acting is improvised based off the art in the scenes, but all the art is square, concrete, cold... and everyone's clothes are suits/dresses with pretentions of style and class. So this ghosts the actors into improvising like they're the best people in the world but also depressed, lifeless, etc.The film goes around in a loop of pretentious class, major depression, then rebellion."
" I think I get it, but it's so hard to sit through
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,6,"I was waiting for it to end honestly, because as a viewer I felt so confused for most parts. It has amazing cinematography in it at times, no doubt. Has some good actors in it but they don't act that much (also a lot of improvisation). Bale is mostly walking around, gazing into nothing or cuddling with some chick. Not a lot of spoken words, and yes, that is the point. The main character feels lost in life and the viewer does as well (and I think that's the intention) with all these random camera shots lasting 5-10 seconds and barely words being spoken for almost 2 hours and when they are, they are often kind of cryptic. The 'Knight Of Cups' appears once in the movie as a tarot card and I looked it up, it stands for making the next step and that's also the father's last word in the end 'Begin', since the protagonist feels lost - That's some advice. Also in the beginning we hear the father's voice reminding his son of the story he told him as a kid about the Knight who drank from Cups and then forgot about the pearl he was supposed to find. So maybe that's a metaphor that he wasted his life for women and party's (cups) and therefore forgot about finding a true meaning (the pearl).
We have to take the movie as it is and it's more a piece of art than a theater movie and it was hard to sit through honestly for me at times and in my opinion they could've told the same story which has some good thoughts a little bit more entertaining for the viewer.There are moments though which are calming, almost like meditation with the beautiful cinematography and calm music playing. So the 'movie' somewhere has it's place and has something interesting about it."
" It worth a 10 but
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,3,"The concept is great
The plot and the monologs are magnificent but it was directed in a boring way I was lost too many times had to go back to where I've been lost like thousands of times and nothing caught me but that I wanted to understand the path
The movie was trying to draw a philosophical idea but it hasn't been clear or hasn't been built yet
And that was something killing after all of this waste of time trying to watch a boring movie 💤💤💤"
" Standing In Front Of Poseur...
",2019-12-31 00:00:00,5,"The trials and tribulations of the rich and famous are the focus here as the jaded Christian Bales flounders around a jet-set Low Angeles hanging his head and crying out in existential despair. Of course there are a few perks along the way as he drifts aimlessly through a series of affairs with impossibly beautiful women, streamlined interiors and exquisite.Ah, the suffering of the artist. A road is seen to be travelled throughout the film as a metaphor to where and the profundity of it's many big questions - Where am I going/Where did I go wrong/How do I get to you finally render the film as a phony, pretentious sprawl. However, in so far far as having ended up on a lost highway myself at this point in my life, it does offer some consolation in the mirrors the film was holding up to me at times. Beautifully photographed and felt as ever, typical of Malick, the question still remains, being, who is it that this film is actually intended for, who is going to be able to relate to it seriously, aside from the disenfranchised Hollywood burnouts or Malick himself? I guess if you wanted to settle in on the Ketamine oneself and just sit back to regard it all as high art then fine but somehow.....it's just not enough."
" Surreal
",2019-12-12 00:00:00,8,"There was some waste here, but in general I loved it, it was like accompanying Bale's character on a journey of self reflection"
" It didnt work
",2019-12-07 00:00:00,1,"Whatever the movie was attempting to do and it may have been a noble undertaking , but it did fail and fail miserably. Terrible terrible wrinting and the acting wasnt any better."
" Irredeemable.
",2019-11-08 00:00:00,1,It's a perfume ad featuring a brooding Christian Bale - dragged out for 2 long arduous hours.
" Beautiful, sureal but ultimatly vacant
",2019-07-27 00:00:00,5,"So plus points is the film looks by way of the cinematography absolutely beautiful. If you read the synopsis and the trivia on this film it will give you an idea of why it feels like four hours and not two. It looks and feels and somehow manages to have all the illogical sense of a Chanel commercial. That's what its like, watching a two hour long ridiculously self indulgent, entitled and non-sensical perfume advert, a waste of time from the man who brought such brilliance as the thin red line."
" I mean...
",2019-07-02 00:00:00,10,"Beautiful girls, beautiful shots, Christian Bale and deep, thinking-required reflections. It's great, but not for everyone."
" I'm just too stupid Mr. Malik
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,1,I barely made it out of high school. You were a Rhodes Scholar. Obviously I am several levels below you in intelligence. This film just sucks so bad. Maybe I just don't get it in the same way I don't get some art that is supposedly great and worth millions and I wouldn't hang it in my house. Maybe you have taken a lot of drugs. I don't know. I just don't get it.
" Waste of Time
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,3,"The only thing makes me give it 3, is their actors."
" Drama in fragments about life, soul, quest for sense
",2019-06-04 00:00:00,8,"As usual with Malick, this movie resembles a stream of consciousness, a philosophical quest for meaning in life.
The key player is a man who lost his purpose, left his wife, and in his search for a forgotten sense surrounds himself with surrogates, in the form of wealth, sex, parties, very beautiful women, but all this distracts him while the lack of sense is always there in the background.
The lost beauty in the soul/self contrasts with the beauty of images, typical in Malick's cinema."
" We are always lost and there is always a void
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,9,"Great acting by bale , amazed on how every stage was portrayed and giving it life,
Might seems boring to people who just hovers over life but if you once dared to dive deep into the ocean of your life and discovered that in the end deep down you we are all just lost and accepted that its the way its supposed to be.
Normal, complicated yet simple, unorthodox and soothing all at the same time.Loved it and really related to it.
I wish more amazing movies like this are directed."
" Quite good theme but not good execution in a movie
",2019-03-19 00:00:00,6,"It could have been great a psychological movie but was turned into a ""free-thougts-stream"" film which actually leads to nothing concrete and doesn't bring anything particular.
The main hero needs to fill his inner void, lack of true relations etc. however it all can be done only when we have some concrete operational plan and a list of rules. Just cos of having dilemmas it doesn't bring any change and true solution and that's why he asks many times ""What should I do? What should I start from?""
This movie can be recommended in 100% however I'd like to watch the same theme in a way better psychological movie and maybe with the Tennessee-Williams-like style of drama plays."
" Existential and introspective poem
",2018-11-29 00:00:00,8,"I don't know what is there not to get. Why people are so confused about this film. It's very simple.
It's said right in the beginning ""Remember the story I used to tell you when you were a boy? About a young prince, a knight, sent by his father, the King of the East, west into Egypt, to find a pearl. A pearl from the depths of the sea. But when the prince arrived, the people poured him a cup that took away his memory. He forgot that he was the son of the king. Forgot about the pearl. And fell into a deep sleep.The king didn't forget his son. He continued to send word, messengers, guides. But the prince slept on.""
And this is basically what this film is about. Trying to wake up, trying to find yourself. Seeing your lived life flashing by before drowning, and feeling the loss and regret of wasted life and opportunity. Now seeing the messages and messengers that were sent to you, but you were blind. You were asleep and refused to wake up. You wanted to dream. You could have been anything, but you didn't choose anything. You were lost and you didn't even know you were lost.In the very end he chooses. He chooses to try again. And pushes himself to the surface of the water."
" Underrated Malick
",2018-11-27 00:00:00,8,"This movie is like a dream that you get to be a part of.It's a Malick film, so you should go in knowing what to expect. I can get how it may be boring or uninteresting to some but I love the journey.Yes, it's more or less nothing more than a man wandering aimlessly through wonder, but isn't that the point?Beauty in simplicity."
" Not my cup...
",2018-08-29 00:00:00,2,"I get that this is art, and something different, but it gave me close to nothing, unfortunately. I give it 2 stars because of the Grieg music..."
" Confusing and messy
",2018-02-09 00:00:00,3,"Knight of Cups is another film by director Terrence Malick in which wanders around and has a certain pretentious art-house feel. This film has been mixed with critics, though most movie audiences haven't been as strong. Knight of Cups featured an interesting trailer but what the film is about isn't too much. The film is for those mainly of fans of Malick films, as this film is anti-mainstream and has a different feel.As others have considered, the film feels more like a long fashion ad commercial, in which the plot i low and at times the film is overall confusing and messy. We understood somewhat but a lot of empty and random scenes strung together makes the film feel disjointed. Christian Bale is the only actor mainly in the film as he is the clear cut lead, while Cate Blanchett and Natalie Portman, whose names are on the posters and are top billed are both very minor (about less than 15 minutes of screen time for each). Overall, Knight of Cups is an acquired taste and in general for those with a strong patience."
" A great relief
",2018-01-29 00:00:00,8,"I was happy to see this sort of a cast to be part of this sort of a movie. I was impressed.It's a contemplative movie, such as La Grande Bellezza and the like. It doesn't have much of a plot, but the feelings expressed, the shots, the gentle suggestions make for an everlasting trip. I was calming to see how easy this movie made me at peace with myself, presenting a scenery of fear and anguish in a most profound way.It's true, it's either hate it or love it, it was certainly worth it for me. The actors' performances were brilliant, albeit minimal. I don't believe the protagonist utters more than 20 or 30 lines. But it's an atmosphere of endless flow and deep introspection. A great choice for personal reflection and meditative retreat."
" Dribble
",2018-01-05 00:00:00,1,Unadulterated nothingness. No entertainment value in the least unless boring has value. Total tripe.
" i had seen boring, then i saw this movie ....
",2017-11-06 00:00:00,1,"I started watching expecting something good or at least not this bad because with such magnificent cast you can only ruin it with extremely poor or terrible script but sadly there was no script. Nothing happens in this movie really, just a few cool shots and good cinematography. other than avoid this one because its pointless,long and no story. I would rather waste my time scrolling my news feed on Facebook all day than watching this.Seriously A BIG NO....."
" Knight of Craps = Shift + delete
",2017-11-04 00:00:00,2,"As for me, this director is done. His last best film was 'The New World'. I don't know why someone keeps financing him. It is neither an art and message film, nor has any entertainment value. In one word, total-crap. All the above, these actors agreeing to do the roles. Definitely this director's films have received more boos at Cannes than any others. Not fit for film festivals, as well as theatrical releases. The surprise part was, I saw it. Even after I felt a similar way for his previous film.There's no story. Just a random acts. Even documentary films have a better narrative. Remember a film was being made by Willem Dafoe in the film 'Mr. Bean's Holiday', this is exactly the same film. Except there's no Mr. Bean/Atkinson here to make it a cheerful additional editing. It was like the director woke up in the morning and decided to do what he felt to shoot without a script.I dislike whispering background narration. It is like a lullaby, one might fall into sleep. Not just asleep, but a deep sleep. Direct dialogues between the characters are like an oasis in this film. If you have nothing to do and ready for a slow film, you should not consider it then too, because it is not a film, but a two hour long torture. Easily skippable film.1.5/10"
" Interesting and Deep
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,8,"Malick's Knight of Cups is not a movie to play around with. It has it's ups and downs, and is about being Lost in the City of Angels. The movie can be summarized by what a stripper says to the main character in the club. You live in a fantasy world, don't you. Something along the lines of that, but it was a great scene to watch.This is a cool movie. It is like any other Malick movie, and most people can not bear the type of direction. But I would say compared to his other films, this one accomplished what it needed to. A very powerful thing I encountered when watching this film is that the first 3/4's of the movie is so deep and intriguing that it won't let you go. But by the last quarter, it purposefully bores you until the end, where you see a car driving off something north on the PCH, indicating you to go explore for yourself. The main protagonist can be anyone. But don't let the coolness of the movie keep you captivated by Los Angeles. There are plenty of other places just as nice, if not nicer.Definitely check this movie out, I would highly suggest it!8 Stars"
" Pay attention to this moment. And everything is there... perfect and complete just as it is.
",2017-09-25 00:00:00,8,"I could write a novel about this film. For quite some time I was thinking how to write short review and not miss the essence. Mass bashing of this movie does not speak so much about its quality as it speaks about today's audience. World got faster, people have no time, they're impatient and nervous, and even worse, they're addicted to adrenaline injections served by modern big and home screens. Unfortunately, this movie is not for everyone. It's not for most of people. But if you are willing to relax, open yourselves emotionally and let the moment carry you, this film could be enriching experience. They say it's pretentious, boring and has no story. True, it's not perfect, it has pretentious and even boring moments and it is very tiring watch if you are not capable to let go. Fact that it does not have plot doers not mean it has no story. It has story, and what a story it has, it just does not tell it in conventional ways. It tells the story by picture and sound and emotion. Every cadre is like a postcard, every sound contributes to artistic photography. This is one of those movies that are not supposed to be analyzed, but felt. I never saw any Terrence Malick movies till now, and if this one really is his worst then I definitely must watch all the rest.8,5/10P.S. For those incapable to enjoy artistic movie, if nothing else, two hours of Christian Bale surrounded with many gorgeous women should be enough reason to at least try.Hungry. Longing for something without knowing what it is.Treat this world as it deserves. There are no principles... just circumstances.You think when you reach certain age things will start making sense. Then you find out you're as lost as you were before. I suppose that's what damnation is. The pieces of your life never to come together. Just splashed out there.So much I was given. So much I left behind.Real life's so hard to find. Where it is? How do you get there?Pay attention to this moment. And everything is there... perfect and complete just as it is.There's so much love inside us that never gets out."
" Knight Moves
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,7,"Shaken after surviving a massive earthquake, a Hollywood screenwriter reflects on his life and faded memories blur with the present in this ambitious anti-narrative project from Terrence Malick. The film is littered with beautiful shots from unusual camera angles and lenses and mobile camera-work that follows the protagonist around and there is a lot to like in Malick's attempts to paint his thought processes on screen. Solid as Christian Bale is in the lead though, he does not have a particularly well developed character, which makes it hard to get emotionally invested in his meanderings. Brian Dennehy provides a very strong performance as his grief-stricken father and there are hints of past tragedy in their family and possibly a failed marriage, but these all ultimately remain hints with Dennehy and Wes Bentley (as Bale's brother) receiving very limited screen time. That said, some of Bale's alone moments are his best and in the film's strongest scene, his apartment is robbed by intruders who scoff at how little cash he has, his lack of credit cards and very few valuables at home; this scene more than any other marks him realising just how empty his life is. More scenes like this may have rendered 'Knights of Cups' a quiet masterpiece. As it is, it is undeniably interesting as something offbeat and very, very different, but it is hardly the most satisfying film out there."
" A Surrealist Collage In Motion
",2017-09-14 00:00:00,8,"(Flash Review)Malick is one director who makes art from film and one of my current favorites. Much like a semi-abstract piece of modern art, his films are organic in many ways and open to the viewer's interpretation. The stories are told more through visuals than dialog. And for me they are shot in such a compelling way that they stick with me even if I'm confused. Like modern art, it may take repeat viewings or reflection after the credits roll to 'get it'. Knight of Cups is filled with bold imagery and edits, jarring at times but they all give a sense of atmosphere. This film 'appears' to be about a man who has lost his brother and like his father is trying to cope with the tragedy. He is also a Hollywood writer and is in the glamorous scene. He is searching for a new direction for his life and to be able to feel emotion again; probably muted from the loss of his brother. The film editing is filled with a collage of glamorous imagery contrasted with calm nature atmospheric shots and what dialog there is is mainly told through narration. Not for everyone but the viewer needs to interpret the fantastic imagery to make something of the plot."
" Enjoyable for 5 minutes
",2017-09-04 00:00:00,4,Christian Bale in random expensive places. With random expensive people. Having some random thoughts. Some random lines. And some random classical music. Feels like spending time on an airport waiting for the two hours delayed departure. Or like browsing Instagram for two hours.What's the point? Is there some kind of Fellini-ambition?
" eau de toilette sans travaile
",2017-06-23 00:00:00,6,"Did I just watch a two hour perfume commercial from Malick? For a perfume that I cannot afford...and perhaps no man can, lest he loseth his soul?I dunno...A completely improvised film where the main character never speaks is going to require a lot on your the viewer. So check your mood before watching this perhaps, I'd recommend a long and peaceful day of sensory overloading at the beach perhaps.The film often has characters born of water. Either at private beaches or at the swimming pools of exclusive mansions. As per the title, there are tarot cards and a reading (in Russian, or something Slavic-ally chic?)Lots of music through-out as emotional inducer, and the main theme was it a riff on Ravel? Is this film a ""Ten"" for the art-house set? And instead of one Bo Derek, you get a full set of gorgeous muses. Collect 'em all.Actually the full main theme has some pretty amazing vocal parts 19+ min that I don't recall hearing in the film. Nice to see Brian Dennehy, and was there some Oedipus aire mixed in the concoction? Was the tragedy in the family spurred by Daddy Dennehy's indiscretions, and does our hero the Knight then have that same wanderlust, granted cut by a mysterious ennui. Mom was only scene walking away I think?Bale is fine in what might have been a challenging role. Although playing tag with leading ladies leaning over ledges is that much of a challenge? IS this a primer for young men before diving into Tinder. Say less, act disinterested and be insanely wealthy. Even then, no love lasts.Wish I'd seen it on a big screen, especially in sensurround for that earthquake (what was that about?) Angry gods in helicopters attacking?When the perfume evaporates, what is left? For most of us, it's the alarm clock the next day and off to work. For the fortunate few, apparently philandering and the life of a philosopher king."
" Masterpiece. One of my favorite films.
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,10,"Well, as you can see by my title and rating, I think this is a masterpiece. I think this is top Malick (along with New World and Tree of Life), where his style is perfect. If you don't know what I am talking about, watch this or one of those other films.In particular, this film is profoundly spiritual (transpersonal, for a more updated term). It deals with the search for truth in life, in an autobiographical/artistic manner - During the 70's, Malick spent many years as a writer-director in Hollywood, with big paychecks and no finished films. But this isn't really a story about the details, but about the universality hiding behind. This is one of the truly profound films ever made. It deals with spirituality in such a deep way that most people don't understand it. But if you have had dealings with spirituality, spiritual masters, transcendence and sacredness in real life, then you will recognize the elements in this film. On the contrary, you will be baffled by the story and you will only think of this as a beautiful but empty film. But, not because you cannot see something, does it mean it does not exist.No, this is not Malick turned into a parody of himself. It is maximal Malick, the most accomplished one. Contemplation is the style. Transcendence is the way.So, in summary, if you are acquainted or would like to be acquainted with the Dao, Advaita, Zen or any other true religion, then you will find a quiet but storm-full mirror in this infinitely profound film. Might as well give it a try. Bliss is on the other side."
" Strange and lost
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,7,"After the failure of to the Wonder, I was hoping Terrence Malick wouldn't do the same kind of film, but he kind of did with Knight of Cups. It's the same kind of drawn out, dreamy film with only wide- angle shots and characters who seem incapable of tacking care of themselves.It's slightly better than To the Wonder, however. There is a much more interesting thread line throughout the film, and Christian Bale is infinitely more engaging than Ben Affleck (why someone like Terrence Malick would want to work with someone like Ben Affleck is beyond me).The film is more like an abstract visual poem than a conventional story. The protagonist is lost in life, and within different chapters of the film, must deal with how he relates to other people and the world around him. It's some real drama, but the strangeness and vague style of the film weighs too heavily and ends up taking away from its artistic credibility.I would recommend the film for Malick fans and general film fans. It's definitely interesting and different from most films, and will probably grow on me the more I see it."
" Knight of Cups
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,2,"The film ""Knight of Cups"" is a big disappointment for cinema lovers. Even fans of the famous art-house director Terrence Malick were not satisfied with his new production.It is obvious that Malick wanted to create a film à la Dolce Vita about the meaningless life of the artistic elite. However given that Fellini's film is a masterpiece of cinematography, this pale copy created by Malick lacks its depth, its humor and its ideas.Malick has made this film without a script like Fellini, relying on improvisation and post-production. If in La Dolce Vita Fellini took full advantage of the charisma of Marcello Mastroianni, the fans of Christian Bale will also be disappointed because his best qualities were not shown in the film. The camera glides over him but does not speak with him. The dialogues and the voice-over are completely uninteresting.Shame on you Mr. Malick! Do not steal from Fellini! This crime will cost you your reputation.While making a film about a meaningless life Malick has made a thoroughly meaningless film.See more reviews at: http://indie-cinema.com/"
" My impressions
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,8,"It's hard to make out a plot in this movie, nevertheless I enjoyed it. The camera work or photography is excellent.. I also appreciated the music, especially the Grieg, since I am a Classical Violinist !I do like the moods and feelings that come across, no doubt each person will interpret these a little differently. It's not an accessible movie to watch, and not a traditional film but still I like it, perhaps not as much as The Tree of Life... since that was slightly more traditional and slightly more defined... this is even more other-world like and one would do well to watch some of his other films first, in preparation.Enough ramble.. just count me in as a fan. For sure."
" Objectified
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,2,"This film attempts to get at the higher calling of a man's soul. Along the way the only thing this man seems to be deterred by is his own objectification of women. As if women are the absolute obstacle on his journey to God. The man in this film seems to be bent on using women. It's a very, very bad movie for this reason, because it never arrives at it's initial premise. I was hopeful at the beginning, but it only shows perhaps the writer/director's own proclivities for women as the ultimate obstacle to God. What a massive miss on Terrence Malick's part, to get it so, so wrong. In fact this is a great sin, that men overlook and debase women the way the main character in this film does. How can you reach God therefor if you debase women this way, as so many men do around the world in all cultures. You are indeed blind Terrance, as your film implies. As a woman I am very tired of women being cast this way in film. It's destructive to human relationships and to our relationship with God. If you read Genesis, God created man and woman in His image, not just man. Women are objectified in this film, so perhaps it's more a film about blindness, than finding God."
