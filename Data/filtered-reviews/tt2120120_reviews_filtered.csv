" A pretty good Adam sandler movie
",2021-04-09 00:00:00,6,I watch this when it first came out and I though it was funny and am sandler is a good actor I like a lot of his movies I don't really like the game pac man that much I play it once and I didn't really enjoy it that much but I know a lot of people like to play it but if you a Adam sandler or a pac man fan you will like this movie.
" Ignore the ratings, GREAT FUNNY MOVIE!
",2021-03-24 00:00:00,10,"Original, hilarious and just an overall great experience for people of all ages! Best part is that Sandler doesn't even use the weird voice!"
" Laugh out loud movie
",2021-03-08 00:00:00,9,"I've concluded that Adam Sandler is one of those actors where I totally enjoy his movie or I hate it, there's no real in between for me and this is my favorite movie with him in it.I picked this up only because the store had a special, buy five Blu-ray movies and get the sixth one free. I purchased 10 and was going to get those two free ones come hell or high water.I fall into that perfect age group where I would spend the weekend at the video arcade playing the games highlighted in this movie so I figured there was a chance that I would like this one. I don't quite get all the hate directed at this movie, it's obviously intended to me mindless entertainment where you enjoy a hearty laugh.Don't over think it, if you're middle aged, grab a soda and bowl of popcorn, maybe even snag the kids if you can pull them away from the PlayStation or Xbox and share some laughs."
" Undoubtedly the Greatest Cinematic Achievement of Our Time
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,10,Has several of the greatest lines in human history and will be studied for decades to come. Funny and innovative beyond measure. Pixels is truly a masterpiece of the medium. Sandler and the rest of the cast's ability to portray these characters and events is nothing short of poetic. Give it a chance and see for your self.
" Love the story. Hate the screenplay.
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,7,It could do better if they rebooted it. Maybe change the director who played the games and good at directing a sci-fi adventure. A better cinematography that's more like a video game and the music can be more 80s and thrilling.
" The ""Little Boy on London Street"" was GARBAGE.
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,1,"I enjoy Adam Sandler films very much, and was thrilled to see such an expansive cast. But the young man who played the ""Little Boy on London Street"" is a HORRENDOUS actor, and a disgrace to Hollywood!! While I watched a movie making its way toward receiving and Academy Award, director Chris Columbus can thank Jack Fulton for RUINING that chance, AND this movie. Schmuck!!"
" Such a good movie.
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,10,"I've come to realize that movie critics are the literal worst.
This movie is so light-hearted, very funny and visually amazing.Give it a shot, it's a great movie!"
" BOOORRRINGGG
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,3,"BOOOORRRINNGGGGGThis is what happens when you pick a script which reads well on paper, but translates terribly on screen. This movie can be summed up. All throughout the movie I was like who directed this, this is so cringe. And to my surprise after the movie I discovered that this guy directed movies like Harry Potter first couple movies, Home Alone Series, Mrs. Doubtfire and other iconic films.
HOW is that possible!Anyways, this film sucks!P.S: This is also the only bad video game movie I watched till now. I enjoyed all the others."
" Best Adam Sandler movie ever!
",2020-12-25 00:00:00,10,"Great movie, Peter Dinklage as always is an absolute legend in this! Not a big fan of Sandler but this is by far one of his best roles. Of course Josh Gad is fantastic in this too."
" This is why I enjoyed watching Pixels
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,10,I did NOT check any reviews or even the low rating before I got to see it. I think that played a vital role on why I truly enjoyed it.
" Pretty enjoyable slice of nostalgia with some silliness sprinkles.
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,6,This is a fun and enjoyable video game based family movie. 2 nerds versus some aliens attacking the world in the form of video games. Pretty predictable yet entertaining none the less.
" You will like this movie if you grew up with 80's video games
",2020-12-15 00:00:00,7,"Come on, it has the standard 'Sandler' movie formula and its filled with 80's video games. If you like either, you will enjoy this movie. Its worth the hour and 45 minutes to check out, you shouldn't be disappointed. if you are disappointed, you really need to lighten up, its a Sandler flick."
" Pixels
",2020-12-06 00:00:00,7,"A movie for children which adults can also watch. Aliens attack earth in the form of video games in giant forms who consume humans. An interesting tale, with humans prevailing in the end."
" Great 80s music, great 80s video games, great 80s movie scifi/ comedy!!!!
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,10,"Ignore the reviewers that dont get what this movie is about. It's a scifi comedy movie using the video game craze if the 80s and adding some great 80s music add the phenomenal cast and it's a winner. Its NOT meant to be the godfather or green mile it's a scifi comedy starring adam sandler and Kevin james and it actually out performs its premise. The slapstick script was near flawless and the acting and special effects just bump it to a 10. Watch this fun film with the whole family what it doesn't have is violence, profanity, sex, gross humor, nudity, bad acting."
" A LOT better than the ratings
",2020-11-23 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed this movie!
It was funny, gripping and really creative. The CGI was done superbly.Of course it has its dumbs moments but hey this what sometimes computer games are all about.It def deserves a far better rating. Best movie with Sandler I have ever watched."
" I think most critics missed the point.
",2020-11-20 00:00:00,8,"I really don't know why there is so much hate for this.
I enjoyed it, it's supposed to be a satirical comedy, don't take it too seriously guys."
" Great visuals and good fun
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,7,"Very underrated movie. It looks and sounds amazing, has laughs, a great ensemble, nostalgics and an okisch plot. Much better than a 5.5!Cmon, don't be a snob and cheater!"
" It's On Like Donkey Kong!
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,5,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Today's long grand final weekend movie review is the comedy Pixels (2015) where after an attempted communication during an arcade tournament in the 80s, aliens invade Earth after intercepting video feeds of the classic arcade games and misinterpret them as a declaration of war. The aliens use the games as models including your Atari and Nintendo favorites Pacman, Space Invaders, Donkey Kong, Galaga and Centipede. Yep that's right, these are the games I was exposed to before hitting up Tekken and Sonic the Hedgehog on other platforms.Back to the movie, in order to defeat the aliens and save the planet the president of the United States, played by Kevin James...who actually does well, calls his best mate who knock knock knock...it's the Sandman who's character Sam came second in the arcade championship back in the 80s and is now a home-theatre installer. The Sandman along with James, Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage lead the team of old-school arcade players to fight back against the aliens.This movie's special effects were pretty good along with the laughs in particular Gad with his conspiracy ridden room and his love interest for the Lady. Kevin James as the president was hysterical especially when he doesn't understand the U.K. Prime Minister played by Fiona Shaw (for you Three Men and a Little Lady fans). The Pac Man scene was good with the mini coopers plus the final Donkey Kong battle was great too. And the Lady Lisa throwback was awesome!! Great reference to an underrated video game character. And the actor playing her...oh my wow!!What let this film down was the supporting cash, like why have 30 Rock alum Jane Krakowski as the First Lady when we hardly see her talk?? And Peter Dinklage...what is with his accent? He was cool as but his accent along crude jokes didn't fit the family friendly tone. Having said that Dinklage along with James had the best moments in this flick. However, the jokes do get painfully unfunny and unoriginal and just add stuff that isn't creative including Dan Aykroyd's vodka brand and an ongoing threesome joke. Overall, 5.6/10"
" Terrible
",2020-10-23 00:00:00,1,This movie is so bad that I put it in my top 10 worst movies of all time and it's an Adam sandler movie most of his movies are just plain terrible this movie sucks A LOT.
" Why can't some people just have fun?
",2020-09-24 00:00:00,8,"I saw some bad reviews on here AFTER watching the movie, so I just thought I would add my own opinion. Why would you hate on a movie like this? Especially if you're my age and remember all these classic games.
The cameos were outstanding, and I didn't expect it to win any Oscars. Man, some people need to lighten up. Was Ghostbusters trashed like this?"
" Why Sandler? WHY?
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,2,"Pixels had a good concept but a horrible execution with some of the worst jokes of the decade, terrible characters that are hatable, Sandler is phoning it in, Josh gad is so annoying, the effects are meh, Peter Dinklage while trying is totally wasted, so many plot holes like how did Eddie put in a cheat code in a car and how does it make it teleport, and the ending makes no sense like they say that Adam Sandler needs to play by the rules so what happens, he does a move in Donkey Kong you can't do, you can't throw the hammer so he cheated. Just save your money and watch the futurama episode."
" Seriously good fun
",2020-09-01 00:00:00,10,"I'm 52, was never any good at pacman (was better at tetris) but this film is just so much fun.
Is it worth a 10 in the whole scheme of cinematic excellence? No, obviously not.
But is it worth a 10 for the entertainment value for the kind of film it is? Yes, I think so.
The cast is ridiculous but perfect. The graphics are super with Centipede being the highlight for me. The old games rendered in a 3d environment (albeit on a 2d screen) are spectacular and make me wish that's how they were rendered back in the 80's.
I just find it ""catatatastrophic"" that folks think it's only worth a 1.
I guess they must be upset that a smurf died!
Oooops, spoiler alert! LOL."
" Enjoyable movie!
",2020-08-12 00:00:00,10,"Enjoyable movie, turns you back in the days with all the music and 80's video games. I personally love it and can watch it over and over again."
" Sweetie, drop that sudoku book now and watch this film
",2020-08-06 00:00:00,9,"To every film critic who rated this movie.. GET A LIFE!!!It's bloody hilarious and receives a good ugly laugh each timeThe visuals ,honey, are wonderful.The concept is original and just damn right genius.Sandler, Gad, James all in one movie. Absolutely criminal to have poured so much love and comedic genius into this film and not received the love it bloody deserves.Christopher Columbus you wonderful man, have a gold star."
" I'm having a ball
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,7,"This is what it is - A fun movie to have a laugh. The great thing about this movie is how they got nerds, vintage video games and aliens, put them into a blender and mix this caper, because they pulled it off!!! I find it organic. All these non-related subjects mingle so well everything fits and makes sense.
I've seen this flick a bunch of times and I always have a ball. The cast pulls it off and Dinklage is very funny.
So much fun!!!"
" Yet. Another. Bad. Adam Sandler. Comedy (though better than most bad Adam Sandler comedies)
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,3,"This is one of the worst movies of 2015 (albeit not as bad as Fifty Shades of Grey or FANT4STIC).Let's start off with the good, the action is solid, the soundtrack is awesome, the CGI is amazing compared to other Happy Madison Productions films, and it is funnier than most modern Sandler comedies. Not to mention its premise being incredibly clever.Now, the bad: The acting is beyond lazy. Sure it's not as bad as Jack and Jill, but it's still pretty lazy. Now, Sandler's character (Sam Brenner) is quite unlikable, as he is a cliched character who is lazy and hates his job. Josh Gad's character (Ludlow Lamonsoff) takes his obsession towards a female video game character to the extreme. Peter Dinklage's character, Eddie Plant is very unlikable and cliched as he trashes anyone who does worse than him. The jokes are just lazy and crappy, such as Q*bert urinating in the Donkey Kong battle. We haven't even gotten to the worst part yet: The ending. (sigh). So basically, Ludlow falls in love with Lady Lisa, who was the only video game character who turned into a human, but after Brenner, Will Cooper (Kevin James' character), Q*bert and Violet successfully defeat the aliens, Lady Lisa is returned to the mothership, and since they keep their trophies, Q*bert stays and turns into Lady LisaI really wanted to like this movie. But I just couldn't."
" Worth a watch
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,7,"Fairly straightforward movie. Bit weird and random, worth watching at least once. End is a bit whatever but we sat through it. Recommend"
" Man, it is just unbelievable!
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,2,"First of all, I like games and was born in 80's.But those were not enough reasons to appreciate Pixel, unfortunately.The movie is something without any logic (even fiction movies must try to have some level). The writers clearly didn't do a minimum effort to connect ideas around the narrative and caracteres. So, things just happen and that it is.The positive side, as a lot of people said, is that you definitely can consider it as a family movie. Children will see the colors and special effects and probably enjoy that. And you will have no concern about violence or hot scenes. For the good... and the bad."
" Better than its rating
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,7,"I'm not sure why such a low rating. This is easily one of the better Sandler flicks in my book, and there aren't actually that many I like. It's fun, nothing's taken too seriously, it's well-acted and well-directed, there's a minimum of the obligatory shock humor that seems to invade all of his movies. I mean, you could probably let the kids watch and that stuff will go over their heads. Maybe, maybe not. Watch it yourself first.I watched it a second time and still enjoyed it. That doesn't happen all that often."
" Not bad as was said
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,7,"I felt the urge to write a review because unlike many negative reviews that prevented me watching the movie, it was really enjoyable and funny, and I really liked it. The idea is very smart and creative, and it was well made in a way that made comedy smooth and spontaneous without affectation."
" Odd?
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,6,"This movie is very strange to review as it is one of those that you will enjoy, but isn't technically good movie.
It's overacted, feels crazy, and breaks loads of rules making this movies technical score (not talking about cgi, rather story and use of cinematography editing ext.) more of a 4/10. However, it's not aimed at movie geeks like me, but rather families, and people that don't take notice of plot holes and bad acting, they just watch the movie for what it is, a movie.
It depends entirely on what you class as a good movie, I personally like films like gone girls, and zodiac (both Fincher films), that have great acting, feel real, and every detail is calculated to an insane extent, but would a kid enjoy almost 50% of a film being dialogue (even if it is amazing dialogue), no.So, in essence, I recommend this film as a family film, and to people that don't look into every detail of a film. But not to anyone that actually cares about acting and story, and cinematography, well actually the cinematography isn't awful.So, as a film geek, and on a technical bases I'd rate it a 35/100
but on entertainment level, i'd rate it 58/100I would recommend wreck it Ralph to people instead of this film, similar concept, but a better portrayal."
" Childhood memmories
",2020-06-04 00:00:00,6,"It's a movie with Adam Sandler and Kevin James. So you know what you will get and that's what you get. Not sophisticated, a bit cheap humor. But it's humor at least and I had some small laughs. The best thing is the memmories it brings and it's also quite original. it probably much better if you have the age that you actually played those games like Galaxy Space invaders, pac man and donkey Kong. Then you have a warm feeling of recognition and childhood memmories."
" What a fun!
",2020-05-30 00:00:00,10,"This movie has not a high-sophisticated story, and it probably has not the best acting. BUT its pure fun. Check it out if you want to have a good time and don't pay attention to the ridicolous low rating."
" It's stupid and mindless fun.
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,5,"It is a very poor video game movie, it's a bad parody of video games, they just used video games and interpretated them into real life, which does not work at all. So I wouldn't recommend it for any video game fan. On the otehr hand it is a fun and very funny movie, most jokes were hilarious, I had a great time watching this garbage disgrace to video games."
" Don't understand why this is only rated at 5.5 out of 10
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,9,"During the lockdown occuring throughout the world I've been trying to find movies that my family can watch.I always do a pre screening to make sure that such movies are acceptable and this is one that I found to be quite harmless fun without much swearing.It seems that most people who have given low ratings on imdb are either an Adam Sandler haters or Kevin James haters.I don't watch movies because of who is starring. I watch movies for entertainment. Obviously we are not expecting some highbrow dialogue from this movie. Its just a nod towards a time that I myself enjoyed. I was an arcader. I am a geek.Of course there are ridiculous moments but those are the moments when my 12 year old son was laughing his head of, as was I. My kids enjoyed the movie so much we have watched it twice in two days. It might not be everyone's cup of tea but overall it was filmed well. The CGI is really top notch. The scriot while crackers is fun. Adam Sandler seems to have some real chemistry with the other cast members. I'd give this 9 out of 10 everytime."
" 7
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,7,It was pretty enjoyable watching at the sunday night. It's pretty underrated.
" Family favorite
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,10,"This movie gets watched all the time in my house. The kids love it and so do their GenX parents. It's all in good fun - maybe not perfectly made, but still a great movie to watch when you need a little light popcorn entertainment."
" Nice
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,10,"I like the bit where pac man ate the Golden Gate Bridge.
Haha dats funny also what's in the secret van and is heroic eppe. (Ghost written by Dallas Huntris)"
" Bright and simple.
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,10,"I love it. It's only my opinion. If you want The ultimate truth, go to your Gods (professional critics). Professional critic can't be wrong, he is Sinless. Listen to critics and bring them your money. Don't listen to yourself, listen to critics only.
So called ""professional critics"" gave it negative reviews. No surprise. Our world is full of evil people. Cinema critics should find some real job and stop typing letters. Our world would be a lot better without movie criticism. It's my opinion. Strong 7 out of 10, but I gvie it 10, because I'm that type of guy."
" Not as bad as peopl say.
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,6,"If you are a gamer, you enjoy playing games and you enjoy watching goofy movies with one of the most positive actors ever, Adam Sandler, you are going to love this one. Yes, it gets way to silly at times, even stupid, but overall, the movie is solid fun, not something special of course which you won't forget. It deserves respect for the quality visuals and CGI, at least."
" Fun idea, but yet another Game Over for Sandler who seems to have endless lives
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,4,"""Pixels"" is an action comedy that sounds rather interesting as the synopsis is something we haven't seen before. Adam Sandler plays former Pac-Man champion Sam a renner who teams up with the president, a U.S. Army Lieutenant, a convict, and a childhood friend (played by James, Monaghan, Dinklage, and Gad) to save the Earth from an alien army, attacking Earth with warriors and weapons inspires by 1980s video and arcade games. I found the idea funny, but Chris Columbus' final execution of the plot leaves a lot left to ask for. While ""Pixels"" is fast paced, action packed and entertaining, the overlaying story, consequences of the characters' choices, and the dialog isn't much to be joyful over. The jokes are generally misplaced and comes at inappropriate times. That Sandler makes a lazy performance isn't anything shocking, what's more disappointing is that Monaghan, Gad, and Dinklage seem to have been infected with the before mentioned comedians' lack of commitment to his job. Yes, ""Pixels"" is a colorful ride and the action scenes are thankfully far more than the painful conversations, but if the film was an arcade game, I wouldn't insert one more cent to experience it again."
" If Ghostbusters was about arcades
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,3,"If you're a child of the 80s, an arcade aficionado, or a gamer in general, this is the film for you. If not, then its not for you and you probably won't like it. However, if, like me, you are in the target audience you will most likely enjoy this film. Although it isn't really that original, (let's be honest. It's ""Ghostbusters"" but with video games) it's still well done. The ending was a bit silly, and felt rushed and du-ex-machina, but up until that point I thought it was great. It is a bit slow in some parts and I wanted it to get back into the action, especially because those parts have no effect on the plot whatsoever. They tried to set up a romantic relationship between two characters, but it's wasted because they don't end up together anyway. And since Sean Bean is in the movie I felt they missed an oppurtunity to make a joke about how he always dies. They could have had him in an arcade where he gets a game over screen, and then had him say ""Why do I always die?"" Missed oppurtunity. I did enjoy the countless 80's pop culture references, and those were the best part of the movie. It's too bad this is getting bad reviews, because I was the only person in the theater the whole time. I thought this was a great movie. Will it be remembered in 10, or even 5 years from now? No, but it's a great movie nonetheless.Grade: B. 8/10 3.5/5 stars"
" A mess of a movie made by people that don't seem to know anything about video games
",2020-03-19 00:00:00,2,"I wanted so badly to be the dissenting opinion on Pixels. I tend to be an apologist for Adam Sandler's movies more than anyone else I know. I also have a great fondness for the days when I would spend hundreds of hours (and probably hundreds of dollars) in the arcade playing things like Pac-Man and Donkey Kong. However, I can't endorse this film, because it is a piece of trash. To be fair, the visual effects are amazing, and I do have to commend them for making the games look so good. I almost found myself caught up in the nostalgia, if it weren't for the fact that it seems no one on the film (aside from the CGI artists) had any knowledge about these games at all. It can look like Donkey Kong all day, but if it doesn't follow any of the rules, then what's the point? I was shocked how this stupid movie doesn't understand the most basic principles of video games, and invents ridiculous contrivances in order to slap together a script that feels like it was never edited after the first draft. They even have a few references to The King of Kong documentary, and yet it seems no one watched that any time recently to get a better understanding of how the game functions, or how arcade tournaments/records work.Even for someone who cares nothing about these classic games, there's nothing worthwhile in Pixels. I'm sure I get a little extra mad at the film because it doesn't pay respect to the games I loved, but it's not like the story makes sense outside of the video game stuff either. The relationships between the characters are not handled well, the hastily thrown together romance is utterly lacking in chemistry, and the humor falls flat every time. I don't expect much from actors like Adam Sandler and Kevin Smith, but even they feel like they are bored or annoyed that they are even in this film. Perhaps Sandler would find some joy in the movie if it all took place in Aruba and he could milk another family vacation out of this film production. Josh Gad is trying so hard to inject some energy into the film, but his character is written so poorly that it comes off like a toddler bouncing around while desperate for attention. And his romantic storyline made me want to put my fist through the screen. Peter Dinklage is also trying, but his character is intended to be a self-important jerk, so it's hard to appreciate the performance. Pixels is a film that looks good, and had a promising premise, but manages to disappoint in every possible way."
" Wouldn't exist without Futurama
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,3,This bad ripoff of a short film ripped off from Futurama's Tales of interest is pretty bad. Imagine a president this bad... wait... just replace Kevin James with donald duck trump but with failure instead of success. This is neither action nor comedy. Fantasy should be the only tag.
" It's fun, yet stupid, but not the worst Sandler movie out there
",2020-03-13 00:00:00,5,"Pixels serves as a tiny step forward from Sandler's previous mess, Jack and Jill. However, despite that, it still has every Sandler trope used in a movie, a loser overlooked by society, and there's a girl involved. The majority of the jokes are DOA, nothing's really funny, and the acting is just strange, with the exception of Michelle Monaghan. But, to be fair, this movie is fun if you take into account of the main story. Forget the romance. Aliens in the form of classic video game characters invading and attacking Earth is an awesome concept, but adding Adam Sandler, Kevin James, and Josh Gad's over-the-top ""paranoid conspiracy theorist"" into this movie, it just kills it, and we're watching a movie with a sense of boredom. I wonder if Chris Columbus regrets making this movie. However, the best parts are the video game battles. That's it. Nothing else is really redeemable. But, this is not the worst Adam Sandler movie. There are some fun moments, but the majority of it is just boring."
" PIXELS
",2020-03-05 00:00:00,10,"PIXELS is a film for people who love video games, but also for everyone else.The story is very funny, and the dialogue is fantastic, he characters coincide with the actors and the special effects are exciting.The only problem is the ""centipede"" part, one person dies and in the end everyone is OK without him.But, it is a very good film. It contains action, comedy, and mystery. I think it is the best movie of 2015.
-Edu"
" I thought I was prepared.
",2020-02-07 00:00:00,1,"I like Adam Sandlers movies, they are fun, most of the time. Yes, he is that typical actor who plays the fun guy all the time. So I thought I was prepared for this movie, you know, the easy fun night kinda style. But this one.. is just too silly. Doesn't make any sense. At all. And it is not even funny. I couldn't even finish it..and from me that is a big word. Sorry."
" One of those movies you can watch over and over
",2020-02-01 00:00:00,9,I don't know why such a low review by people . The characters and comedy writing are very enjoyable . If your a Sandler fan don't miss this one
" Cheesy Fun!
",2020-01-27 00:00:00,8,"So enjoyed this quirky comedy! Just the right combo of silly and quick wit to appeal to just about everyone. Fantastic effects, a couple of great cameo characters, and a dash of 80's nostalgia - what more can you want!?!"
" The best movie
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,10,Very epic movie super gamer not lamer adam sandler is the hot
" Pretty Good!
",2020-01-12 00:00:00,6,"This 2015 sci-fi comedy stars Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Michelle Monaghan and Peter Dinklage. Sandler plays Brenner, an electronics installer who helps his pal, Cooper (James) who is the President of the U.S. when Pixel aliens take the form of 80's video/arcade games and invade Earth. Brenner was an arcade pro as a kid and uses his skills to defeat the pixels, but with help. Monaghan (The Heartbreak Kid) plays Violet, a defense aide of Cooper who Brennan argues and finds romance with and Dinklage (Games of Thrones) plays Eddie, a convict who played against Brennan as a kid. Sean Bean (Goldeneye), Brian Cox (Super Troopers) and Dan Aykroyd (Ghostbusters) also appear. This is a pretty good flick, the cast is decent and the effects are amazing. If you were a kid in the 80's like me and remember playing Donkey Kong, Pac-Man & other video/arcade game classics, you'll like this."
" Fun

" Video games and plenty of cheese, baby!
",2019-12-21 00:00:00,8,"Okay, so apparently I'm one of those people that did enjoy it. An eight star rating isn't the highest I give, it's true, but I have a pretty fair understanding of how bad it can get, what it really means not to have done your homework...The writers and the makers of this movie have done their homework, but they also make fun of the Hollywood-cliches, the hero's journey, all that stuff... Some people might apparently interpret that as bad acting or not having done that great, but the whole point, the joke is, that it's cheesy as your mother's Pac-Man!Boosha! Feel me? Your mother's Pac-Man?! Right there!So it's fun and video games. Do you even know what that means? Is there anything serious about a video game? No, there isn't! World Championships in videogames? That's a thing? That exists? Oh, I'm sorry, am I pressing your buttons? Throw in another quarter and hit some of your own, you overgrown Donkey Kong!It's a fun movie. Of course you shouldn't take it seriously. And no, when the movie is over, you don't get to marry the video game warrior lady yourself or any of the other hotties. They are in the movie, you aren't. And that was also the angle of the writers.It's just plain fun. And cheese. Lots and lots of cheese."

",2019-10-10 00:00:00,4,"You get Adam Sandler, Josh Gad, and Kevin James together, and you get a mediocre movie. I'm sorry, everyone, but this is a sad movie. Hardly any of the jokes are funny, the acting is foolish, and it's boring if it's not an action scene. Josh Gad's performance specifically is crap. He revovles around the other actors to make a joke, and he's stereotypical and annoying throughout the movie. But the reason I gave it only a 4 out of 10 is because you can still enjoy the movie. Almost everyone I know who's under 14 and has seen this movie really likes it. And I can't blame them. This has some cool action scenes like the London scene, and the chance at New York that saves it, bit it might be my only acception. It's still a mediocre movie."

" Yet another Adam Sandler misfire. Don't bother

" My Review!
",2019-08-29 00:00:00,7,"Great concept of bringing childhood memories back to life. I've played every single game portrayed in this movie and boy it made me nostalgic. It makes you go back and play some again instantly. A tad bit dry sometimes, but worth watching it in a theatre. Peter Dinklage, Adam Sandler; these two actors of extreme onscreen character plays, you gotta watch how they turn the tables in this one.Peace Out!"
" Most boring movie

" What do you expect.
",2019-08-12 00:00:00,2,"Yet another unforgettable Adam Sandler movie, comedy is bland, acting is bland and every thing about it is bland. You would probably laugh for about 1 minute at the most out of 101 minutes film. Pixels is just another bland comedy of the 2010s."
" Popcorn movie
",2019-08-11 00:00:00,6,Story was good. Needed a few touch ups. Funny. Humor action. Mindless fun watching movie.
" Pixels mishandles nostalgia whilst harnessing the memorability of a dusty arcade machine.
",2019-07-03 00:00:00,2,"As a video gamer myself, my childhood was in the midst of this iconic cultural movement. Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Galaga, Donkey Kong and of course Tetris. So for a film to use these legendary titles, well, the nostalgia should've instantly won me over. But wait! What's this? Happy Madison Productions is involved? The same writer as 'Grown Ups 2'? Urgh. And this is why we can't have nice things in life. An extraterrestrial race misinterpret video games as a declaration of war (oh, a time capsule of a championship was sent out to space for no apparent reason), to which they mimic the characters within the games and send them down to destroy Earth.A planet hosting an array of powerful nations with the capacity to decimate cities with the click of a button. But you see, the army just can't get to grips with the pattern of Centipede or Arkanoid. They Just aren't trained enough in arcade gaming! So naturally the army recruit a former Pac-Man champion, his video-gaming nemesis, a random conspiracy theorist and the President of the frickin' United States. I do not want to be in a world where Kevin James is the President and Adam Sandler stops an alien invasion. Nope! Anyway, as you would expect from the onslaught of recent films that Sandler's studio pump out every year, it's bad. Not even an entertaining ""turn your brain off"" kinda way. It's just flat out terrible.Herlihy's writing was incomprehensibly painful to say the least. No character personalities, no bite to the plot and certainly no humour. The story exists to play on the nostalgia of its audience, without actually going anywhere with it. Colombus' direction is bland and predictable right down to the inner code. The cast were just playing themselves, and Sandler happened to drag fine actors into this mess. Monaghan, Shaw, Cox and Bean, come on you fine actors! Just say no next time. Q*Bert has way too much screen time and is, for some unknown reason, physically communicating in English. At one point, a certain character engages in intercourse with their video game crush. And, wait for it, produces five baby Q*Berts. Five of them! Nope. I'm done. Why the hell is Iwatani involved? Why does Max Headroom look worse?Aside from the semi-decent pixelated visual effects and Serena Williams being the queen that she is, Pixels is one glitchy affair that is essentially unplayable."
" Perfect.
",2019-07-02 00:00:00,10,"This movie is exactly what it should be. Early 80s low resolution games attacking earth. So what do you expect? Adam Sandler being ridiculous, Peter dinklage not being Tyrion, Sean Bean being ridiculously British (shame he didn't get a scene with Peter)...Heroes, villans, stupidity, a touch of romance, a loveable kid... Easy movie to sit back to, relax, and stop taking everything so serious.Perfect."
" my notes
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,4,"Some funny parts and an intriguing premise with interesting situations. but lots of jokes fall flat and the movie just gets worse and worse. It is very unrealistic, which I am okay with in this sort of movie, but it just kept getting more ridiculous. absolutely nothing made sense, it seemed like they just made up a bunch of stuff and put it in the movie (1 viewing)"
" I almost lost faith in humanity
",2019-06-19 00:00:00,1,"This movie takes most of what we know about video games and spits on it. It's a shame that most people on IMDB can't even see that. Firstly, there are NO cheat codes on Arcade cabinets like Donkey Kong. I don't know why they made such a stupid plot point like that, but it's not true. Now our new generation will not know this about retro-gaming.Next, the military aren't stupid so that they don't recognize a pattern. One of my good friends was a war-veteran. He said that the army would train them with video games all the time. So the fact that they made the military unable to recognize patterns just to make Sandler look good is idiotic.Third, it's so unreal. How can Sandler's character just have clearance to walk into the White House? Why does he win the heart of the woman he creeped out? Why is Kevin James the President Of the United States? Why are women treated like trophies on this bad movie?Finally, they take a big insult to video games themselves. Toru Iwantani getting his hand bitten off by Pac-Man? I wonder why he agreed to such a humiliating scene? The whole Lady Lisa thing was so annoying. The fact that she was Q-Bert in the end was disgusting and mentioned by Sandler, but why the movie lets this slide is idiotic, Jeff Lee is probably very angry right now.Avoid this movie please, and stop trying to make it seem like a great movie about video games, because it's not. It's really bad. (I wish I could give it zero stars.)"
" One word, Dinklage.
",2019-05-22 00:00:00,10,"PIXELS is dumb fun, cast aside your expectations of a deep insightful journey into the complicated abyss of video game lore and instead bask in the glory of Peter Dinklage as the dwarf version of Billy Mitchell, a pompous arrogant video game genius who calls himself ""The Fireblaster."" It's worth the watch for Dinklage alone. Get drunk before watching and you'll enjoy it even more. Yes, someone in this World loves this movie, I will not apologize nor am I ashamed."

",2019-04-05 00:00:00,10,"This movie changed the way I viewed life. The social commentary on how McDonald's chicken nuggets are fake shook me to the core. Adam Sandler's performance was great once again (I LOVE JACK AND JILL), surprised he didn't win best actress at the oscar. The movie was very realistic as you can see the people. Petee dingledong was great as that guy who wears glasses. 100000000000/1000000000000"
" The only reason I watched this is because I love video games
",2019-04-03 00:00:00,2,"Pixels is nothing more than your typical Adam Sandler movie, filled with stupid humor, but in a way, the video game special effects (for characters such as Pac-Man, Mario, Donkey Kong, etc.) are top-notch and gives you a rush of nostalgia, however I can't say the same for the performances, Sandler still plays the same old man-child role, as does Kevin James, Josh Gad also plays the same old goofy sidekick role who is so obsessed with the Lady Lisa character from the fictional video game ""Dojo Quest"", played by Ashley Benson of ""Pretty Little Liars"", to the point at the end, just to make him happy, Q-bert (the only video game character that gets a lot of screen time in the whole movie, him being in the movie because it's a Sony production and Q-bert is also owned by Sony) transforms into Lady Lisa and they fall in love and have Q-bert babies! Seriously! Overall, an interesting concept marred by infantile humor from Happy Madison."
" Could be Worse
",2019-03-25 00:00:00,5,"Why is it that the best ideas make the worst movies? The whole idea of earth being attacked by aliens in the form of video game characters is silly - but still good material for a fun summer movie. Unfortunately, it's not a fun summer movie at all. I will admit that this is definitely a guilty pleasure, and that gamers and 80's kids will probably love it just for the nostalgia factor, but as a movie, it's really bad. Adam Sandler is consistently mocked for his quality of movies, which has been going steadily downhill, and can't seem to recover. This movie is part of that massive slump. It features the double whammy of him playing a former expert gamer who is now a mechanic with Kevin James, who is now President of the United States. That's every bit as bad as it sounds. The plot is that in the early 1980s, a satellite was sent into space containing items from Earth, including several retro video games. This was seen by the aliens who recovered it as a threat, so they recreated these creatures and sent them to wreak havoc on Earth. It's goofy, yes, but it could be great fun. Perhaps the biggest problem with this movie is that it could be just good fun, but it's really not. It's dull, cliché, and forgettable. The characters aren't interesting and the story is bland. However, the references to the old games are nice, and it's cool how each action scene reflects the games so well (like the Pac-Man scene in New York). Q*Bert was probably the best character in this movie. He actually curses this time. What happens to him at the end is just... freaking disgusting. All in all, it's not as bad as it could be. That's not saying much."
" Not that bad

" Innocent special effects romp is highly enjoyable
",2019-02-14 00:00:00,8,"I guess the the way to describe this movie is Ghostbusters lit up in neon. Please see it just for the cgi, it's awesome. If you have the dvd look for the short on how they created one of the cute characters. The comedy is snappy, almost witty, and yet nothing new, but it works. You'll smile rather than laugh out loud. The story is absurd, which is exactly what we pay Hollywood for, and with this one they've outdone themselves. There's a classic chase. There's a great cameo appearance. There's a cleverly worded love affair. There's a great homage to nerds of the 1980s and overall, I thought, a really whacky satire of big budget invasion movies. It's just such fun."
" Good movie, Josh Gad is hilarious
",2019-02-04 00:00:00,6,"This was a good movie. Great soundtrack, some funny one liners especially from Josh Gad. ""The zapruder film was doctored JFK shot first!""

",2019-01-06 00:00:00,4,"Pixel is a dumb movie.
I see a lot of people rating it 10/10 and i don't know what they see in these movies.
Sure it was entertaining but entertainment dosen't equal good.
And saying that it's for kids and you shouldn't critique it is stupid.CHARACTER
The characters sucked.
Sam is a dude who plays video games and has no character arc or depth he stays the same.
Violet is the smart girl who also knows acrobatics and she shoots guns.
She is bland and has no character arc either.
Ludlow is the fat nerd who screams and is also a good gamer but he lacks any depth character arc or development.
That guy in prison (i forgot his name) has a character arc that's very short and rushed.
He is a cheater Matty says ""Hey! you're a cheater"" Prison guy says ""I don't care"" Matty responds ""Ok"" Prison guy changes his mind and dosen't cheat even though it's a life threatening situation.
Why does Matty even care if he cheats i mean this is a life threatening situation so who cares if he cheats.
Q-Bert is a plot device he is there so that the plot can reach conclusion.FINAL ACT
It's stupid.
The evil people says that they broke the rule not explaining why and how and Q-Bert is used so that they can reach conclusion.VERDICT
This movie is stupid and those giving it above 6/10 i don't understand those people.
Those reviewers just ignore the important aspects of filmmaking and say ""I enjoyed it so that means that the film critics are stupid and pretentious"" your enjoyment dosen't matter.
You can enjoy something but know it's bad like this movie, i enjoyed it but i know how bad it is."

It was fine and fun - maybe they just have too tight of panties, or don't get the cultural references...Look, nobody watches Adam Sandler movies expecting ""Gone with the wind"" or what have you, so to complain that it isnt super deep, or intricately plotted is like complaining that a fine hamburger isn't filet mignon at a 5-star restaurant.As an extra, I really liked the theme music, etc. Blending old with the new."

",2018-10-17 00:00:00,1,"There are little (really little) bits that are inventive enough, funny enough, visually engaging enough, dispersed around the runtime of this movie.But in the crappy hands of Adam Sandler and Kevin James, all those little ideas get nowhere, build to nothing, and they end up forgotten in a sea of awfulness.The """"characters"""" are non-dimensional. The situations stupid. The military react in ridiculous ways because of course. It's all dumb. Now, all that can be transformed into a good enough parody. But they aren't doing even that. It's a waste."
" The best rainy sunday afternoon movie you can find
",2018-10-12 00:00:00,8,"This movie shouldn't be taking seriously. The acting is alright, the jokes are alright, everything is just a solid 8.This movie is best compared to popcorn; you eat it, enjoy it, and keep on eating until the bag's empty. It's not bad, not excellent. There's nothing deep or remotely emotionally engaging going on. But it is fun, fast-paced and a blast to watch.So just think of Adam Sandler and if that thought puts a smile on your face go watch this movie."
" It has potential and great characters, but it's still lacking.
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,6,"At first glance, this is just another Sandler movie with 'Paul Blart'. That's not where the movie's potential lies. The result is still a mediocre kid-in-an-adult-body representation of Sandler's expression. The addition of historical video game characters gives it a bit of a nostalgic experience that could (and should) have been investigated further. By adding Peter Dinklage and his pivotal character to the cast, ""Pixels"" was boosted to an acceptable level which makes it enjoyable for small children, or the nerds who enjoy the backgrounds of the various details. Unfortunately, these backgrounds would have made the movie a good watch if they were given a more prominent position in the foreground, to hide the lacklustre interaction between the main characters. The idea and resources were all there, but in the end the sum of the parts didn't add up to a whole movie.CGI was fine, entertaining, but ""lame"". ""Pixels"" felt like Elijah Wood's reaction to the arcade game Marty McFly discovers in ""Back to the Future II"". Luckily we don't need our hands to watch ""Pixels"".In the end, it's worth a watch, but for those who don't understand the backgrounds and details, it'll be nothing more than an inflight entertainment second choice."
" A visual atrocity. This film is in insult.

",2018-09-30 00:00:00,10,"An underrated movie that was actually funny. I'm not the biggest Adam Sandler fan but this is an amazing movie that doesn't deserve all the hate it gets. Personally I didn't grow up with arcade games because I was born in the 2000's but I did get nostalgia from it with Jump-Man (Mario), Pac-man, Donkey Kong, Tetris, Quibert, Astroid, Frogger, Duck Hunt, and Centipede but minus that it still is funny. I recommend this Sandler movie."

",2018-09-25 00:00:00,10,"I've been a long time IMDb reader but the reviews of this movie are so bad that I finally made an account just to leave this review.Adam Sandler was perfect in this. I can't imagine anyone else playing it better. He's funny, charming, genuine, and has great chemistry with everyone in the film. The supporting cast did a great job. The one thing that doesn't add up is how the dweeb character of Kevin James became POTUS in the first place. But I overlooked that and enjoyed the movie for what it was. Entertaining, fun, a great story with great pacing and special effects. Sci fi fun, great action, and very well done all around.People need to chill out and get over themselves. These low reviews are not justified, make no sense, and are just Debbie downers who don't know a fun feel good film when they see it.There were so many little details in this that were spot on, and everyone's role, big or small, was executed very well. A great soundtrack and fun throwbacks to so many classic video games makes this a total win. Sandler, Columbus and crew should be very proud.I'm hoping and praying for a Pixels 2 soon! That would be so amazing. This was a fantastic movie. Ignore the armchair critics and see this with an open mind. You're gonna have a good time."
" It's fun, don't expect Independence Day or something
",2018-09-24 00:00:00,8,"I don't understand why this movie has such a low rating.If you expect a serious treatment of alien invaders, yeah, you're going to be put off.If you realize that this is an Adam Sandler production with Adam in the lead role and Kevin James as the doofus POTUS, you'll know that this is not a serious movie at all. It's fun.Hey when Q-Bert is a character and is as likable as I thought he would be, it's got to be good, yeah?"
" Don't hate on Pixels!
",2018-09-24 00:00:00,10,"I'm another watcher who can't understand the bad reviews! My kids laughed out loud. So did I! The kids have asked to watch it again. It's a fun, silly, family friendly (for an Adam Sandler video game apocalypse) movie. Stop hating and take it for what it is. I liked this. I liked Dr. Stranagslove. I liked Citizen Kane. Different movies can be entertaining in different ways. There are so few family movies that aren't cartoons these days!"

" Original! Even for an Adam Sandler movie
",2018-09-10 00:00:00,9,"This movie I found somewhat nostalgic, because it includes Pacman, galaga, centipede, q-bert, and even Donkey Kong! It has it all, and I was really surprised to see this amazing idea come from the Adam Sandler crew. It's based on a short film, but they made this movie work. Really the only problem I have is some of the jokes thrown in, but it cancels out when you realize they just want to make an original action flick."
" Good clean mindless fun harkens back to 80s

" My review of one of the worst movies in a while, Pixels
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,2,"A lot of people said how bad Pixels is. That is one of the worst movies made. But I had hope that maybe this movie was good. That one person may like this where others hate it. Hope that this isn't as bad as it. You know what I did that hope after watching this movie. I took it behind my house and shot it in the back of the head. Then set it on fire. This movie was awfulThe opening scene is Brenner and Will as kids and what do they do? They steal a little girl's money selling lemonade. Our heroes ladies and gentlemen. Clearly this two have high moralsYears after a time capsule is shot into space with video game footage, aliens find the capsule and immediately think it's an act of war. The aliens are stupid. This aliens are so advance that they are basically pure energy and yet they can't see video games are just for entertainment. Do they have any entertainment or are this aliens not only stupid but boring as well?My biggest complaint is Peter Dinklage character Eddie. He's just awful. The character is basic guy who thinks he's the best in the world and just a terrible human being. He's in prison and one of his demands of his help is he wants Serena Williams and Martha Stewart in the Lincoln bedroom. I have never felt more unclean until he said that. I almost got sick. Literally my stomach felt terrible. In the ""last"" battle against Pac-Man, he cheated. He put into a code to make his car move faster. Wait what!?! That makes sense in a video game but IS REAL LIFE!!! You cannot enter a cheat code and suddenly boom you're unstoppable. And he never really learned his lesson really. He just says I'm sorry and everything is good. No. No! NO! He's the biggest reason the aliens called them cheaters because he cheated. He in the end he gets Serena and Martha in the Lincoln bedroom. He shouldn't of be rewarded at allOne of the things that bug me the most is Admiral Porter ""The Bully"" doesn't his comeuppance. He spent most of movie shooting down Sandler and Josh Gad's characters but never gets is just desserts. He has that doesn't make sense to me at all. He's watching TV about Sandler and all the good his teams done and say ""I don't know what's worst. If they fail or they succeed"". That answer is easy. IF THEY FAIL!!! They fail and world is destroyed. Are you the egotistical? Later he calls out Sandler and Michelle Monaghan characters and that's the last we see of him. It would of been awesome if he was fired or something. ANYTHING!!!OK. I have said a lot of bad things. Let's talk about some good things and put some bad things about them. First everyone had a problem with Kevin James as The President of the United States. He was a great president. He acted like a president. People only see him a party animal or blue collared slacker. Here he doesn't. Yes there is a scene where he party with the troops after a victory over the aliens but I would of react the same way. When Sandler and Gad brings proof of the aliens, he doesn't believe them like the president would. He acts like a president would and should. The only problem I have is Jane Krakowski plays his wife. I'm sorry but I don't see Kevin James and Jane Krakowski hooking up. It's just weirdI really enjoyed how the aliens communicated. They used old video clips to communicate their massages. I had Ronald Reagan. Hall & Oates. They even had Madonna. That was pretty funnyI don't have a problem with Josh Gad's character being in love with a video game character. A lot people are. I mean come on Rule 34. Enough saidFinally Adam Sandler plays a character that isn't a idiot. I know he has before but we have gotten so use to it that we just accept it. His character, Brenner, which is a terrible name for a person, see patterns in video games that no one could find. That's amazing. He could tell the difference between the 1982 and 1986 video game. That to me is pretty cool. I wouldn't be able to the difference and I doubt others could too. My main problem he let's that lost in a video game tournament when he was a kid control his life. I'm not going to pretend this hasn't happened to anyone. I've had some events were I wish I could go back and changed it but here's the thing, it was one event. JUST ONE and he got second place in a national tournament. My God if I got second place in anything national, I'd been the happier guy around. You couldn't surgically removed the smile. It would look like The Joker from Tim Burton's Batman. Yeah that big. And yet he not thinks that was terrible but let it control his life. I'm sorry. I know you are trying to make me feel bad for this character but it doesn't come off like that. It feels like a bird poop on your car so can't drive that car anymore it was some it ws traumatic.

",2018-08-24 00:00:00,5,"(Flash Review)If you spent oodles of hours in front of your Atari, Intellivision or Colecovision your skills may save the world one day! And today is that day! Martians have misinterpreted a time capsule, sent in the 80s by the US government, containing some video game footage on a video cassette as a declaration of war. They should have used a Betamax tape and this problem would have been avoided!! So the Martians come to earth in the form of your favorite video game nemesis: Donkey Kong, Centipede, etc.. and friendly Pac-Man and Q*bert. By the way, Q*bert is really cute in this. Meanwhile, a storyline of how two kids who battled for Donkey Kong championship in the 80s is formed and quickly fast-forward to their lives of today and of course they'll be the ones saving us from the Martina attack. Mix in a cheesy love story, a dash of social commentary on video games of today vs the 80s originals and a terribly planned and executed storyline involving Kevin James as president. This had the potential to be much better and different than say TRON since it is a silly and goofy premise...but it was rooted with a good amount of charm that it did leverage. If they had only put a bare minimum of effort into the government storyline it could have been funny as well as fully palatable. So yes, there are some very bad scenes, crap plot points but if you chill out, there is charm and amusement to be found here. How many game characters can you spot?"
" Enjoyable
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,7,"Overall, this was a fun, enjoyable, family movie. The CGI was amazing in my opinion and the storyline was fairly strong. There wasn't too much action and the dialogue was quite good and the cast were great as their characters. It was a fun movie and it wasn't as bad as many of the critics said it was. It was a great movie that I'll watch again at some point."
" fun movie
",2018-08-17 00:00:00,8,"A great movie for the whole family.
Ignore the critics and go see it."
" Fun!

" An amazing idea ruined by an awful script
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,3,"This movie is one of the most disappointing movies of 2015, as the trailers made it seem like it was gonna be an amazing nostalgia filled time. But instead, it's just another really bad Adam Sandler movie. Look, it's definitely not the worst he's done, but it's nothing good whatsoever. The idea behind this film is straight up genius, as alien signals are sent with video game files, and then the aliens send back the video game characters. That's awesome, but this movie just straight up ruins it in almost every way. One, the script is just awful. This is because nothing is really funny, there are extremely large plot holes, and it's just uninspired and subpar at best. Two, the only enjoyable performance done was by Peter Dinklage. He was awesome, but everyone else was just not funny and kind of half hearted. Kevin James does the same exact thing he does in every other movie he's in, Adam Sandler looks uninterested most of the time, Michelle Monoghan comes off as non believable at times, Josh Gad yells a lot and isn't that interesting, etc. Overall, almost nobody really gave it their all, which doesn't surprise me considering how poorly written everything is, so I don't blame them for this. I mean, besides this movie, everyone in this film were great in other films. Three, as a comedy, this movie fails miserably, as it's just not funny. I'm sorry, but I don't find Kevin James as the freaking president or Josh Gad screaming for little to no reason that funny. I guess I chuckled a tiny bit, but once the novelty wore off, it just became painful to sit through as jokes never really landed. However, like I said, Peter Dinklage was awesome, but that's about it. Overall, I really did not like this movie at all. I know there are people that like this film, because I've read the reviews, and while I'm glad that they enjoyed it, I just can't. I wanted to love this movie, as the idea for this film is one of the best I've seen. It just feels like after the idea was conceived, little to no effort was put into making this film a great one, which really sucks. There are a few things I did like that keeps this a tiny bit better than other Adam Sandler films in my opinion (for whatever that's worth). The idea, like I said previously, is great, and the visuals are amazing and they look great. I guess the performances aren't that bad. Sure, they're not quite as believable or funny as they should be, but they are passable, I guess. Besides that, there is little I can recommend about this movie. It's just another crappy Adam Sandler movie, and I hate saying that, because I really thought this movie looked really cool. But, alas, this is just an amazing idea ruined by an awful script."
" Game On!
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,9,"Hey, I grew up in the 80's and this movie was totally tubuler.
Nostalgia maybe, but it was funny, cute here-suggestive there, and never boring. 
5 point somethin'... I don't think so."
" It's a FUN movie. Nothing more, nothing less. I LIKED IT
",2018-06-21 00:00:00,8,"Look... this movie does exactly what it's supposed to do. It's meant to be fun. In fact, my husband who collects vintage video games and I mean, is a serious collector, LOVED IT. And I thought it was great fun. IT's not supposed to be an Oscar level movie. You watch, and you accept it for what it is. Sandler is Sandler, and I enjoy his humor. For some reason, the critics have turned on him in a bad way and I don't know why. But I suppose his type of humor is for the young and he's a middle aged man now and maybe should have turned to more serious roles? That's at least what I think is bugging these folks. But I like the movie. And I'm watching it now which is why I wrote the review. Great fun. Keep 'em coming, Sandler. You have fans and that's who you are making movies for."
" Not quite game over but doesn't have enough for game on
",2018-06-03 00:00:00,4,"Watched 'Pixels' a few days ago with not very high expectations. Am not a fan of Adam Sandler, although he has done good performances in the past or the juvenile humour that permeates in too many of his comedies, and the advertising and negative reviews made me further nervous. Absolutely loved the concept though and have a lot of love for Peter Dinklage ('Game of Thrones' is a favourite and he is one of the main reasons).It also garnered a lot of vehement defence so condescending that it put me off watching it for a long time until it came on Film4 and decided to watch it finally. After watching it, 'Pixels' for me was not a particularly good film and didn't do enough with such a great concept, but it could have been so much worse. It is not that bad and is a long way from being one of Sandler's worst (nothing is worse than 'Grown Ups 2' and especially 'Jack and Jill').Starting with the good things, 'Pixels' looks great. Especially in the imaginative production design and truly impressive special effects. There are amusing moments (almost all of it from Dinklage and occasionally from Josh Gad), some decent action and an element of nostalgia.The soundtrack is suitably energetic. Other than the visuals, the best thing about it is Dinklage, for Dinklage it is far from one of his best performances but he does show a knack for comic timing.However, Sandler is on lifeless autopilot throughout and his comic timing is irritating and tired. Gad tries hard but too often over-compensates that he is more annoying than funny and Kevin James is just bizarre in his role. The rest of the cast are wasted and the direction lacks energy and ease.More annoying was that 'Pixels' had such an inventive concept and managed to make it so bland and predictable. There are no surprises here, no originality or imagination, the fun and energy only comes sporadically and tonally the film feels muddled. The references may make older viewers nostalgic but most of them don't serve much purpose and are likely to be lost on younger viewers unfamiliar with what is being referenced. Further killing 'Pixels' is the writing and humour. There are moments that do raise a mild chuckle or smirk but a vast majority of it induces groans and cringing, because the dialogue is so childish and forced and the humour is incredibly juvenile in a way that has been tired and grating long before 'Pixels' was made and came out. It's been present in a lot of Sandler's films especially the ones released in the last decade or so and there is a lot of deja vu here.In summary, not that bad and has its moments but wastes a great concept and is just too juvenile, bland and bizarre to get much from it. 4/10 Bethany Cox"
" Funny !
",2018-05-29 00:00:00,10,"Is it the best , Oscar winner awesome movie? No. but it's pretty funny, with a fun light hearted premise ."
" Visually impressive but overall below average
",2018-05-18 00:00:00,5,"Pixels looked to be a very interesting film when the trailer first dropped. But, upon hearing how poorly it was doing, I avoided seeing it. When it on came TV earlier this year, I decided to give it a go. I think enjoyed it more than most people did but it was obvious why it had been criticized so much.Many people have said it would have been better if Adam Sandler hadn't been in the lead role. I partly agree with that statement but I believe the films biggest problem is it's script. The story has a very unique concept (based on Patrick Jean's short film) but if it had just been scripted better, then it may have been more successful. There were multiple moments in the film where I found myself saying 'really?'. I must admit I found myself shouting in disbelief at a few of the scenes involving Josh Gad's character towards the end; I personally think this was a pretty poor performance from him. Plus hearing Q*Bert speak English wasn't quite right either. If he'd spoken the same way he did in Wreck-It-Ralph then it might have been better. And that post-credit scene was, to put it quite simply, wrong.But the film wasn't all bad. The story is very original, the special effects are brilliant, the few gags that the film has are quite funny, Peter Dinklage's acting is top quality as ever and the final battle set to 'We Will Rock You' is very enjoyable.All in all, it's a long way off being the worst film I've ever seen but, equally, it's even further away from being the best."
" Good for people from 80's and 90's
",2018-05-06 00:00:00,10,I might not be from either but I have played some of these gameboy and DS like the original Pakeman and Donkey Kong. This was very a thrilling for both me and my sister especially because it is the first film we watched in IMax at the cinema and it was very good especially with all of the pixelations and special effects used in this film.Ignore the haters this is a very good film.
" The Best Movie Since Baby Genuises
",2018-04-30 00:00:00,10,It had Adam Sandler in it. And it was better than Shawshank Redemption. I really liked when PAC Man ate Jamie Beltman!
" Sam Brenner: Whoa. She went from zero to psycho in 3.4 seconds; a new world record.
",2018-04-26 00:00:00,6,"Pixels was what I expected, so I wasn't disappointed. Some light fun.Some casting opportunity was wasted. Not so much Sandler, but James, Monaghan could of been better. Gad and Dinklage's characters the standouts. Ashley Benson be my pixel baby. They should have done ""Frogger"" or something for the finale, I don't see the attraction of ""Donkey Kong."" I liked the song and montage of the scenes in video game form during the credits, a nice touch."
" Too Stupid to Watch
",2018-03-29 00:00:00,1,"I've watched and like a lot of Adam Sandler films, but this one was probably one of the worst ones I've ever watched. In fact, it was so bad that I turned it off before it was even finished playing. I'm a child of the 80's and love the old school video games, but this was just beyond stupid."
" Everybody wants to rule the world
",2018-03-24 00:00:00,7,"This is an Adam Sandler movie so it automatically has lovers and haters with parents wondering if their kids can watch it. The film opens in 1982 with kids playing in an arcade championship with the tape being sent into space by NASA for aliens. Years later when Kevin James is POTUS and Sandler is on the NERD Brigade installing TV systems, the world is attacked by aliens using video games tactics. Only the old time players have the ability to defeat them, sort of like ""Ghost Busters"" but not nearly as funny.For those who like movies based on video games, this one goes over the top. The script is formula with minor twists but not real surprises. The language was iffy as it uses the word ""b***h"" which made the kids giggle. There was 1 F-bomb. There is some talk about sex such as making a Martha Stewart, Serena Williams sandwich. Definite PG-13 stuff.Adam Sandler managed to score minor roles for his wife and kids. There are some fun scenes with era music and people, even though some came after 1982 creating anachronisms.Good mindless fun, aimed at teens who were around in 1982 and wormholed into the present."
" You deserve to laugh! Watch this movie!
",2018-02-21 00:00:00,10,"Been watching this several times and it never failed to amuse me and my kids.
The movie was absolutely entertaining. I actually don't understand the low ratings. The acting are just right with their character and the story of the movie. I enjoyed Josh Gad's acting (oh come on! He was funny here!).If you feel disappointed after watching this movie because you think it was silly, (like Adam Sandler's acting was bland or why the heck Kevin James was the president) -- then I think you just have the wrong expectation for this movie.I would feel bad if you were not entertained at all. (Maybe ask yourself.. what is wrong with me ? Why didn't I enjoy that ?)"
" Right up there on my top list of favorite movies!
",2018-01-25 00:00:00,10,"This won't be a lenghty review. I just need to say that i loved this movie. My weakness for old classic arcade games might ofcourse have influence my rating, but i still think this would be a very entertaining movie for the whole family. I've learned through the years not to take all movies so seriously but instead let the movie tell me what is real.Again, i loved this movie and now i must see it one more time!"
" Good-natured comedy with a retro feel
",2018-01-22 00:00:00,6,"You know, I had every reason not to like PIXELS. It's a Hollywood blockbuster comedy with an emphasis on special effects over story, and it's directed by Chris Columbus, a man known for his twee, family-centred productions. It even stars Adam Sandler, who I'm no fan of. Despite all these detractions, I found PIXELS to be a breath of fresh air in a tired world. It's fast and funny, and a treat for anyone who grew up in the 1980s with 1980s-era video games. The film plays out as one big action set-piece with jokes in between, and thank goodness, there's no crudity for once. Sandler himself is okay and Kevin James is a hoot as the bad-mannered president. Peter Dinklage is the real scene-stealer of the group, though, and there are fun cameos from famous names including Dan Ackroyd and Sean Bean. The film's CGI effects are exemplary and just as good as in a massive budget blockbuster like AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON, and that city-wide climax is something to behold. Check it out!"
" 9/10
",2018-01-15 00:00:00,9,"Strong 9 out of 10 in 'dumb-comedy-you'll-definitely-watch-again-at-some-point' genre. Although, not an instant classic but decent entertainment and, I believe, an original idea not an adaptation/remake/reboot garbage. I was quite skeptical about spending hard earned $2.99 on a movie with such bad ratings, but fam wanted something funny, so we went for that, and it was a pleasant surprise. I laughed hard few times, chuckled few and was in a good mood all the time. Definitely recommended for those who know what to expect from production with Sandler in it; you won't be disappointed."
" Reminds me of Wreck It Ralph meets Jumanji only in B form
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,4,"This happened to be on TV and since I never seen it before as it bombed back in 2015 I decided to check it out. Directed by the same guy that brought us Mrs Doubtfire and Bicentennial Man this film is about a group of adults who were video game nerds back in 1982 and some strange stuff starts to happen as video game charcthers like Pacman and Donkey Kong come alive so its up to Sam Breener(Adam Sandler), Lover good(Josh Gad) and co to try and defeat the charcthers that have came alive or its game over.
This film is like a B movie,its silly,it stars the worst actor ever Adam Sandler alongside his bff Kevin James,every time Josh Gad appeared Olaf came into my head.If you are a video game lover and love the actors in this check it out."
" Perfectamondo
",2017-11-28 00:00:00,3,"This film is an exquisite piece of fine art. Adam Sandler is the greatest mind pf the 21st century. I wish Kevin James were the real president. Sean Bean says commercial and that wasn't great. I don't know why this film is not in the place of Shawshank Redemption on this website, I know for a fact it's the best thing I've ever seen in my life."
" Pixels fails very badly to be a good movie. Pixels is not entertaining, nor enjoyable and it's just a dumb bad film.
",2017-11-12 00:00:00,2,"Pixels: Movie Review.Pixels has a very good concept and story idea about a movie that is about classic video games but it fails very badly to be a good movie. Pixels is not entertaining, nor enjoyable and it's just a dumb film.The direction is very weak. The performances of lead actors, cast and characters are very underdeveloped. There are no real feels to any of the characters in the movie. They all seems to just stand on the screen with no real interests in their characters. The whole cast is very very underutilized. All performances feels and looks very under performed. Pixels lacks the entertaining and enjoyable fun factor of good action comedy movie and its just a dull wastage of very good concept idea. The story plot is very unconvincing and uninteresting and whole feel of the movie is very dull. The storyline idea is good but looks very dumb on the screen in the terms of a good movie and fails to deliver the beauty of its concept. The script, is below average, lacks interesting elements, and has pacing issues. The movie feels very slow and boring in many useless scenes. As a fan of these classic games I was really disappointed by the film. The only positive thing about the movie Pixels is some Visual shots and effects of those old classic arcade games and the performance of Peter Dinklage is good to certain points. Some gaming characters like Pac Man looks good in 3D and some 3D Visual scenes are interesting. Otherwise, all over Pixels has a very good concept idea but fails as a movie and succeed as a one of the major disappointing movies of recent times. Pixels could have been a good movie but sadly it is not.(Please Note: That This Review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film, and does not represent others. Thank You)."
" Perfectly fun camp. And mullets!
",2017-11-02 00:00:00,8,"Critics panned the movie for precisely the reasons it's fun. It highlights the fun of video games and arcades in the 80s. The plot isn't deep, but it's creative. The special effects were first rate. It *IS* a movie made using 2015 technology, it's just set in the ""blocky pixel"" days of the 80s. The marriage of those two elements is excellent. And who can pass on a chance to see Peter Dinklage in a mullet! Ignore the critics. Watch this movie for the fun that it is."
" Pixels: Must Watch
",2017-10-17 00:00:00,9,"The movie, Pixels directed by Chris Columbus, is a great family movie because it has great humor and incorporates life lessons for children. Pixels is about these teenagers, Sam Brenner, Will Cooper, Ludlow Lamonsoff ""The Wonder Kid,"" and Eddie ""The Fire Blaster"" Plant who all loved playing classic arcade games. In 1982, there was a video game championship which was videotaped in order to be included in the time capsule that NASA would send out in hopes to get in touch with extraterrestrials. Eddie becomes the ultimate champion which leads Sam to believe that he can never be great at anything for the rest of his life. The Voluva, the belligerent extraterrestrials, receive the time capsule and take it as a threat and invade Earth. Now Sam Brenner, Will Cooper, Ludlow Lamonsoff, and Eddie Plant must work together to defend Earth from there invaders. Critics say that Pixels is a poorly made movie, and the actors are just trying to make money, but I say that Pixels is a great movie because it teaches you life lessons, shows people that life does get better, and has credible actors and actresses. Pixels teaches not only kids, but adults that using the shortcuts in life may not always be the best option. Eddie uses cheat codes as a kid to become the video game world champion. Matty learns that Eddie uses cheat codes when the police fish his sunglasses out of the river from the fight against Pac-Man. He finds that Eddie has written cheat codes on the top of his shades which he used to cheat against Sam and even in the challenges that the aliens sent. The aliens send Earth a message saying that they have violated the rules of the game and that ultimately makes them the winner if the challenges and they can now destroy Earth. Everyone in the United States government blames Sam for losing, even though Eddie is the real reason why Earth has lost. This proves that cheating always has consequences even if it is not in the foreseeable future. Pixels teaches the audience that cheating is not the answer, and it also teaches them that people should never give up. The audience learns that no matter how far one has fallen, even if they have hit rock bottom, one can always come back. As a teenager, Sam loses to Eddie in the video game championships in 1982, and he loses confidence in himself. Sam never really finds his purpose in life because he thinks that he is not capable of doing anything. This all changes when the aliens invade Earth and he steps up top save the whole world. He learns that Eddie cheated when he played in the video game championship and he realizes that makes him the real video game champion. This gives him a huge confidence boost and he uses that to defeat the ""boss"" and saves Earth. Pixels demonstrates how people can come back from anything if they try hard enough. Moreover, Pixels shows that everyone can have a happy ending. The audience learns that even though one can be really weird and awkward, they can still have a happy ending. Ludlow is a really weird character who never really had any friends. He loves conspiracy theories and he fantasies about being with this character, Lady Lisa, who is a part of a video game. When the extraterrestrials invade Earth, he has to fight Lady Lisa to defend Earth. Ludlow realizes that he does not have the heart to kill her, so he confesses his love for her and she joins his side. They end up getting married and having ""kids."" Even though people may seem that they will not live a great life, if you work hard anything is possible. Pixels also cast credible actors and actresses. Well known actors and actresses, that are famous for comedy, star in Pixels. The leading actors and actresses are Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Michelle Monaghan, and Josh Gad. Adam Sandler is a well known actor who has a reputation of being very funny, and Josh Gad is known for his work playing Olaf in Frozen. Many people expected the movie to be a lot better than it actually was because of the actors that starred in it. Although some people think Pixels is a waste of time, I think it is great movie to watch with your friends and family. The movie, Pixels, teaches children life lessons such as, working hard to get what you want, never giving up, and how cheating is never the answer. Some people argue that Pixels is a really bad movie and it is not worth watching at all, but I say that Pixels is one of the best movies I have ever seen that has incorporated video games in a unique way to teach life lessons."

" Garbage
",2017-09-30 00:00:00,1,"Potentially the worst movie I have ever seen. I am a fan of video games, and sometimes I don't even mind Adam Sandler. The concept could be cool and I was kind of excited when I heard about this movie, but the personal stories were stunningly awful, and the acting was brutal. The jokes weren't funny and the characters were annoying."
" I'm not gonna lie this is one of Adam Sandler's best.
",2017-09-07 00:00:00,7,I love this movie! This is one of my favorites from Adam Sandler. It felt like a birthday present from Adam Sandler because it came out the day after my birthday but I took advantage of the early 7:00 showings and I laughed throughout the entire movie. Adam Sandler was funny as usual but was eventually outshined by Josh Gad. I liked Kevin James as the President. A lot of people thought he was a poor choice but I thought it worked for this movie. Michelle Monaghan was great. I don't think Peter Dinklage was the best thing about the movie but he was good. I really liked the presence of Brian Cox but I wish there was more of him. I liked the fact that Sean Bean was in it but I don't care for the accent he used. I was surprised that Ashley Benson had no dialogue but she's pretty and I thought her character was pretty cool. I honestly think this and Pearl Harbor are some of the most underrated movies I've ever seen. I don't entirely get why people hate this movie because it has a great concept. It's like people think a movie's automatically bad because Adam Sandler's involved. He has talent. Sure he plays the same character in almost every movie he's in but if you're like me you can set that aside and enjoy his movies. I'm not saying all Adam Sandler movies are great but I enjoy most of them. Why was this the movie that had people saying that Adam Sandler has to quit movies? This movie is an Academy Award winner compared to what I've seen of Jack and Jill. It makes me sad that after this movie he basically started acting in Netflix movies. I am glad that The Meyerowitz Stories is getting a limited release in theaters but I do hope Adam Sandler comes back. This movie is not without its problems. I don't like how it just jumps into the some of the action sequences without any set up and it would have been nice if there could have been more 80s songs like Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins. I also wish (as I said before) that Brian Cox appeared in the final scene congratulating the arcaders on their victory and apologizing for doubting them. Maybe the movie would have been more successful if it had actors like Robert Downey Jr but it's great for what it is and I enjoy this movie..
" Ouch why
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,5,"The 5 is because I love several of the classic arcade games herein. And a few of the jokes do land but not near enough for a movie. Sandler is mediocre, james is lame, dinklage does OK poorly cast in general. This movie could have been great lots of fun but they tried way to hard and pulled a face plant. Surprisingly fairly family friendly might have been a better children's movie except they wouldn't get arcade games."
" Mild Entertainment
",2017-07-13 00:00:00,4,"Pixels is a plot story of nerds and nostalgia in 3D. A rather lightweight Adam Sandler family movie that's not as ghastly and retrograde. The film begins in 1982 when 12-year-old best friends Sam and Will have their first encounter with arcade games. Just as in many preview Sandler films, it starts with a flashback as him and his friends as kids, then eventually shows the present day.Pixels isn't as funny or entertaining as I had assumed. Though from reviews and critics it is clear what this film really was about. Much about the film makes little sense and the humor isn't at all clever or anything new. Sandler plays his typical character, while Kevin James is the president (very odd choice). There are some decent scenes of entertaining involving the visuals but in the end the film doesn't grasp or make an impact that it could have. Such as the character of the little orange creature 'Q-Bert' steals its scenes. The Pac-Man coming to life scene involving them as 'ghosts cars' was quite well done too. The film made most of its money in the foreign market which helped it from becoming a complete box office bomb. There were rumors at a sequel but not that appears to be very unlikely."
" Gave my Girlfriend a Panic Attack
",2017-07-12 00:00:00,2,"I was not blown away by it. The idea was cute, but Adam Sandler's character was unnecessarily vulgar as usual, talking to a female character that was an unrealistic bimbo and everything was pretty predictable, so it wasn't my cup of tea... but there is something worse...There is no way around this: this movie induced a full-on panic attack in my girlfriend. We were just watching it to pass the time, but at first she was bored, then she was trying really hard to not watch it, playing games on her phone, etc, then I had to turn the movie off, shortly after the PacMan scene, because she asked me to. I later asked her about it, and she told me it was triggering her anxiety.You see, my girlfriend has irregular anxiety about existential dread: We don't really know what happens in the afterlife, and she is incredibly worried that it would be just boredom and nothingness, or maybe there is something happening there, but it is so uninteresting that it makes you wish that even it was not happening, as you are trapped there in bored purgatory for all of eternity.This movie gave my girlfriend a panic attack, because it reminded her of her greatest fear that she could be trapped in boredom for all of eternity.2/10 the animation was cute"
" Totally Fun
",2017-07-08 00:00:00,10,I loved this movie. It was totally fun. Adam Sandler's best movie in my opinion. It was filled with cool nostalgic gaming images and lingo. Such a fun plot. It is a feel good movie that only true old school gamers or real gamers who enjoy retro games will understand. Haters gonna hate ... and I say to them...relax and enjoy the fun and enjoyable experience this movie is. Then run out and find a retro arcade room and play until you can't play anymore.
" 8 Bit Fun
",2017-07-02 00:00:00,7,"I don't understand why there's so much hatred for Pixels. It was just silly dumb fun. Sure, it's an Adam Sandler movie, which, I'm sure for many, reduces the score by 1, but it looks great, it's fast-paced, and as long as you turn your brain off and go for the ride, it's just great family entertainment.I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it; it's filled with charm and quirky characters (and stereotypes) and the effects really are spectacular.Check it out, but seriously, don't expect earth-shattering scripts or anything even remotely of any depth. The story is about one pixel deep, but the movie has plenty of heart and it's funny, too!"
" Arcade mis-fire.
",2017-07-02 00:00:00,3,"Let me start by saying that I'm not averse to Adam Sandler—I've enjoyed quite a few of his films—and I admire Chris Columbus if only for writing Gremlins. Pixels, however, is dreadful, and fully deserving of any critical mauling it has received.A promising premise—aliens attack Earth in the form of video games after mistaking a videotape of '80s arcade classics for a declaration of war—is developed as a series of lacklustre action scenes loaded with flashy CGI and not very funny humour.Sandler adopts his usual affable loser persona but can do little with the lousy material; also wasted are the talents of Brian Cox, Peter Dinklage and Sean Bean, while the lovely Ashley Benson, as sexy game character Lady Lisa, is there purely as eye candy (not that I'm complaining about that—she was sorely needed to take my mind off the terrible comedy).It's also hard to see who the film would appeal to: adults will find much of the humour childish and grating (the 'cute' digital Q-bert character had me cringing in embarrassment), while the many references to '80s pop culture (Max Headroom, Hall and Oates, most of the games) will be lost on the young.And is it even possible to use a cheat code on an arcade machine? I think not."
" Not nearly as bad as reviews made it out to be
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,7,"I avoided seeing this movie for two years until it came on free TV, just based on the abysmal reviews when it first came out. To those who trashed it so badly - what were you expecting? It's an Adam Sandler movie, it's not going to be masterpiece theatre.So the premise is ridiculous (aliens create weapons based on 80s arcade games to attack the Earth), the script is silly and at times self-contradictory, some of the humor induces groans rather than laughs and a lot of the acting was over-the-top. OK, maybe I'm seeing where those bad reviews came from...But if, like me, you practically lived in the arcades in the 80s, this movie is just jam-packed with nods and references to games like Centipede, Pac Man, Donkey Kong, Space Invaders, Robotron, Burger Time and others. It was fun just trying to identify which games all the alien attackers came from.My one gripe is that there were some characters that were just made up for the movie. I was scratching my head trying to figure out what game the purple ninjas were from, or where the red dressed warrior lady came from. Turns out they were both invented for the film.Another questionable aspect is why the intellectual level of this movie is clearly aimed at pre-teens. They weren't even born when these games were popular.Overall though, if you're looking for a mindless comedy with well done special effects and tons of 80s video game references, this makes for an entertaining couple hours. Just don't expect an Oscar winning film."
" A must-see comedy!
",2017-06-03 00:00:00,10,"It's not one of the big movies with complex plot and playboy actors filling the screen. But the incredible actors and the quirky plot will connect with you and you'll enjoy this movie. I personally find that watching the movie without knowing much about it is the best way, I don't watch trailers, or read comments(ups), the plot and I advice other people to do the same, because this way you'll find everything exactly how it was intended to be, trailers many times spoil good parts of the movie in order to attract people. The actors where the ones who bought be, Adam Sandler and Peter Dinklage, I was curious how he performs in another thing than Game of Thrones and it's fabulous, he's such a versatile actor. Adam Sandler did his part perfect as expected in a comedy, which is a territory almost ruled by him, one of my favourite. Don't listen to the Metascore or the IMDb mark, just watch it!"
" Unfunny for all ages.
",2017-05-07 00:00:00,4,"Not even this all star cast could save this awful movie. The intended humor is so bad, it must be directed at children. This is a children's movie. I doubt even your kids will laugh. The references are adult with child humor, leaving both parties dry.An adult will see a few things that make he or she flashback to old times. Bringing a smile. I will also say some of the effects are pretty good.. Making SOME parts visually pleasing. For these two reasons, i raised my rating from 1 up to a 4. This is one of the worst movies i've ever seen, considering it has a famous cast. If the cast were nobodies. My rating would've been 5.If your kids are home, and you're busy doing something else. Play it ..otherwise spend your time more wisely."
" Slightly Underrated
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,7,"I have to admit i only waited so long to watch this movie because of the bad reviews. now i finally watched it and i have to say that its not as bad as you might think. but its no masterpiece either. its one of those movies that did't fully reached its potential. but to really like this movie you probably should be at least in your late 30s and have played those games when you were a kid back in the 80s. i don't think people, especially kids today would really like this movie when they have never played them. that being said if you are in your late 30s or older, give this movie a try. a good 7 four you. if you are under 20, don't bother watching... you won't like it. for you its probably only a 5."
" The story was crap (trailer) but then IT TURNED AROUND 100%
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,8,"I am sorry guys. I am sorry to tell you that your reviews, even though I like the general ratings of IMDb a lot and often they reflect my own, are total garbage in this case. And here is why: After seeing the trailer for Pixels I thought to myself ""Omg, what a stupid storyline, it does not make any sense and it looks stupid."" So I did not go to the cinema, because I didn't like the trailer. But when it actually arrived on Netflix I just couldn't help myself and watched it (I am a huge fan of Kevin Smith and Michelle Monaghan and I kinda like Adam Sandler sometimes). After I whitnessed the explanation for the entire story to be fantastic (SPOILER ALERT: NASA sent games into space and an alien race thought it was a declaration of war) I really enjoyed its comedy and special effects as well as all the characters (except Piter Dinklage's character who was just annoying af) a lot. I do not see a single flaw in the entire movie to be totally honest. Of course it is a popcorn type of blockbuster and nothing in comparison to One Flew Over the Coocoo's Nest or Pulp Fiction, but for what it was meant to be (to entertain) it was of supreme quality. Kevin Smith as a failed president was more convincing than Bill Pullman in Independence Day and the entire cast was believable, especially Monaghan did a great job playing the snobby White House employee. And oh man, the jokes were genius. I laughed my *** *** when Adam Sandler asked if no one was disgusted by his friend kissing a small green alien that suddenly changed into the woman of his dreams. And the final scene where their babies jumped around, I nearly died.So, please, for the love of god: If you are a true gamer and haven't seen the movie: WATCH IT. Thank you for allowing me to enhance your perspective on excellent movies."
" Imaginative, and a good movie for what it is
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,8,If you like the Adam Sandler classics you'll like this movie. I love Sandler and saw this in the 5 dollar bin and it was 5 dollars well spent. It drags a bit about 2/3 of the way but ultimately not a bad movie if you use your imagination. Definitely a fun movie to see with your kids.
" Another movie where you should not listen to critics...
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,8,"I will be honest, i like Adam Sandler stuff for the most part. Sure some movies have overall childish humour and such but i always have a good time with them, usually watch them when i am drunk too cause its like that i will appreciate them more.When it comes to Pixels, the games represented are from the era before i started playing video games (pretty much before i was born), i do know them and played them a bit later but they where not my childhood games as my first console was an NES. Despite this i could really enjoy seeing those very old games on the big screen and seeing the characters in them.Obviously you have to suspend your disbelief on some aspects like Kevin James as President but this movie is about old video characters attacking the world so duh...This is the kind of movie where you buckle your seat belt, have a few drinks and watch for the laugh and thats about it. Its a fun comedy !"
" Literally Space Invaders... Loved it.
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,8,"So here's my guilty little secret - I like Adam Sandler films...Even though he's done some real dross in his career he's brought out a movie or three that has made me laugh out loud, from Airheads back in 1994 and including The Wedding Singer, Little Nicky, Mr Deeds, Eight Crazy Nights, 50 First Dates, The Longest Yard, Bedtime Stories, Funny People, and now Pixels.I love the fact that it makes a parody of the Voyager space probes, which contained golden records containing information about Earth, should an alien race find them... and be able to play them!Now, I was a kid in the 70's and 80's so I remember Arcades and the hours and money spent on Invaders, Asteroids, and Pacman. I could never get the handle of Defender, though. So this movie spoke to me right from the opening shot. So our future hero's are the nerds of their time taking part in a great Arcade Shoot-Out, where it comes down to two players, Eddie, portrayed brilliantly by Peter Dinklage, who gives a nice air of sleaziness to the character and his ""Hard Guy"" voice is great, and Brenner, played by Sandler (who does another great portrayal of Adam Sandler :-) ).Brenner loses and this loss paves the way for his future fate as he never quite gets to become the person he dreamed of in his youth. However, his best friend Will Cooper fares better and is elected as the President of the United States. So when the strange attacks on the Good Ol' US of A cause concern and the heads of security cannot figure out what is happening President Cooper spots something familiar on a video clip and calls in his friend Brenner for help.This is a totally outlandish plot, which the actors, writers, and director do a fantastic job of playing straight and make the comedy about the situations and narrative. The scene where the creator of Pacman meets his ""Sweet Little Boy"" is well thought out and is a perfect example of this.And the scene where Brian Cox's and Sean Bean's characters become ""Extra Close"" made me laugh out loud... very loud... loved it. The director, Chris Columbus, uses all of the actors and each of them gives a good performance to build character and comedic situations. Not one of them feels like they would rather be elsewhere; this makes for a better film. He also keeps the pace going as the action ramps up to the finale.To be honest, I cannot find a single fault with this film. Yes, Adam Sandler's acting dexterity isn't of the highest calibre, but in this film, he tones down the outrageousness of some of his previous movies and it works well within the story and movie, so it's not a drawback here.And since I can relate to the film, as well as it making me laugh a lot and giving me a nice warm and happy feeling, this has now elevated it to the upper ranks of my favourite comedy films.I would recommend this to all, just sit back and let the happy come..."
" A movie which only has visuals going for it
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,1,"Pixels was a movie I was optimistic about seeing. Then I saw it. The first of a few problems is the actors. Adam sandler is a good actor in this, but his character is bad, the female and the nerd dude are forgettable, Kevin James and Peter dinklage are awful (Acting and characters), and the rest of the cast is irrelevant. The plot loses cohesion as the movie progresses, and it is not explained how dinklage cheated on both the arcades and in the pac-man battle, and the aliens somehow know eddie cheated. The last and most glaring problem is major anachronisms throughout the film. As well as Madonna, Samantha Fox, Daryll Hills, John Oates, and Max Headroom all being relevant AFTER 1982, when the capsule was stated to have been launched, many games are also improperly shown. Arkanoid (Taj Mahal, it's not Breakout, as that was only on the Atari 2600 and 5200), The duck hunt dog, Paperboy, and tetris were all after 1982 (Duck hunt was released first in the 1970's, but the dog did not appear until 1984 on the NES). The only positive is the pixel effect. Though technically voxels, it still looks very nice. To quote Rotten Tomatoes ""Pixels has little replay value and is hardly worth a quarter."""
