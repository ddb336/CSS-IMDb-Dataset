" Taylor Sheridan Once Again!
",2021-03-29 00:00:00,9,"Taylor Sheridan has become one of my favorite writers of films and even with his television (Yellowstone). After viewing Sicario and Wind River it was only right to get around to this, and boy I was impressed. Ben Foster was spectacular with his role as Tanner Howard. The cast for this film was picked correctly and I don't think anyone else could have done a better job. The film is extremely realistic aswell with the shootout scenes, cover-ups for the heist(s), etc. If you're a fan of classic westerns and want a modern day spin on such with some quality writing, directing and acting, this is the film for you."
" 9/10
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,9,I do Like the crime thriller movie it is a nice film to watch u are entertained by the performances
" Exposition at its less clever
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,4,"Weak script with scenes where characters do nothing but engage in less than interesting conversations about their past just to give exposition. Doesn't deserve the casting and praise it got, imo. The lack of effort in the writing tarnished the directing and acting worth its while."
" Excellent, must see
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,9,"A must see movie. It's quick paced, well acted and doesn't drag on at all. Very good story, if you haven't watched it stop what your doing and watch it."
" One of the best I've seen in years.
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,9,In my opinion Academy Award performances by Jeff Bridges and Chris Pine. It's a strong believable plot with excellent performances by all the actors involved. Even the extras were above average. This was my first introduction to Ben Foster. He's going to go far. The movie really captures the spirit (or lack of) of West Texas.
" Hell or High Water
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,1,"Ok I was very UPSET WITH THIS FILM. Yes it had a GREAT CAST But the Acting was Terrible come on REALLY you do not ROB A BANK THE WAY YOU TWO CLOWNS DID EXAMPLES.
#1 You do not ROB a Bank take away a Man's LODDED GUN PUT IT ON THE COUNTER SO HE CAN REACH IT.
Then you leave the BANK AND THE FARMER WITH HIS LOADED GUN.
He Shoots at your Car and MISSES EVER SHOOT.
#2 Out for Breakfast that Probably cost you $5 Bucks. You DO NOT GIVE HER A $200 HUNDRED DOLLAR TIP. Then ROB the Bank across the Street. As you are running to the Car Bills are flying every where.
#3 You Both are such Dummies at the Casinos.
#4 Oh as you leave the Bank the Police are SO STUPID THEY DON'T EVEN CUT YOU OFF. ALL THEY DO IS CHASE YOU AROUND LIKE CLOWNS.
This has to be the WORST BANK ROBBING FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN."
" Watch what you fight for
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,8,It's all great until you start using the guns you have been brandishing. But what did you expect?
" Hell of a movie
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,10,This was great from beginning to end the actor's was amazing I love the big brother he wasn't playing no games and he was a sharp shooter I don't wanna spoiled the movie but the last 40 minutes had me glued to the tv I'll definitely watch this again sorry for the poor grammar lol
" Taylor Sheridan...wow
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,10,"I don't typically review a film as a 10, but this one passed that threshold for me. I love everything Sheridan has done so far. There is something about the bleak and desolate settings mixed with an engaging plot that gives his work some real staying power. From Wind River, hell or high water, and Yellowstone, it seems everything he does is right up my alley. I've shown this film to at least 10 people and everyone has said they thoroughly enjoyed it and would watch again. Ben Foster has been one of my favorite actors for a couple years now and he is fantastic in this movie as the Alpha type of brother who can't help but always pick a fight. Jeff bridges and Gil Birmingham are hilarious together, their chemistry was surprising but refreshing in a movie that I was not expecting any humor from. Love the loyalty of the two brothers all the way up until the end. I think I just talked myself into watching this one again. Damn I love West Texas"
" GTA Texas
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,8,"Really gave me Grand Theft Auto vibes. The Texas setting is perfect and the characters, especially the almost retired sherif are really well played."
" How to stop the disease of being poor
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,8,Two brothers lost their mother and the older one just got out of jail. They rob banks in Texas and got back to their house in the middle of nowhere and bury the car they drive while robbing the banks. They were having lunch at a diner and the older said that he'd go to the bathroom and robbed the bank by the diner by himself and they escaped together. Before that Toby tipped generously the waitress which later said to the police that she didn't recognize them .Toby divorced and want his two sons have a comfortable life unlike them. The two rangers Marcus and his indian partner stayed at a hotel in a town because Marcus thought they'd rob that bank. They went to a restaurant with a very weird old waitress. They waited there for a long time and Marcus figured they'd rob another bank. The two robbed the relatively bigger bank on the payday. The town people chased them outside with their cars and the older brother stopped and shot the cars with his rifle and made them return to their town. It was a very impressive scene. Toby was shot but it was ok. He took the other car and the older brother moved on with the police cars behind. He went up on a hill and exploded the car. At the summit he started shooting people down there and the town people also showed up. The Indian ranger got killed and Marcus with a town man went up behind him and Marcus shot the older brother in the head. They couldn't catch Toby he wasn't a suspect but Marcus wasn't convinced. He retired but went after Toby seeing he gave the range to his sons and his ex wife and he was living elsewhere. Marcus said he'll keep chasing him and he left the ranger where they found oil beneath and making lots of money. They were rich now. Their sickness of being poor thru generations were cured. It was a very good movie with great actors like Jeff bridges. Everyone was interesting including the waitresses.
" All it needed was a bit of Burt....
",2020-12-18 00:00:00,7,"The first ten minutes of this film did not inspire me. Chris Pine (""Toby"") and brother ""Howard"" (Ben Foster) rob some small town banks and attract the attention of the soon to retire, curmudgeonly Jeff Bridges as Texas ranger (""Hamilton""). Well, as it pans out much better than I had expected: the characterisations are strong; the pace and writing keep it interesting and although the story is riddled with holes and inconsistencies the thing flows along well as the ranger homes in on his increasingly reckless quarry. Bridges' persona is a little similar to his ""True Grit"" (2010) but Gil Birmingham plays a good foil as his cohort (""Alberto"") and the four create quite a lively and enjoyable cat-and-mouse action adventure that had me undecided as to whose side I was on until quite near the end... Largely uncluttered by soppy romance, it's even got a slight Robin Hood spirit about it too."
" A Very Good Movie
",2020-12-11 00:00:00,7,"A truly worth watching movie. A good storyline, acting and excellent cinematography in the remote plains of West Texas that seems to be a too far away a place from the glitzy USA we have come to know from most mainstream Hollywood movies. The soundtrack to the movie is awesome with a selection of some truly great tracks."
" The perfect package.
",2020-11-10 00:00:00,9,"British director David Mackenzie has been making films for around twenty years now and with his varied output I suppose he could be called one of 'the new auteurs'. The fact that he isn't necessarily that prolific only piques our interest. He made ""Hell or High Water"" in the US in 2016 and it was nominated for Best Picture which proves that really good independent cinema can find favour and a market. Superbly written by Taylor Sheridan, it's the story of two brothers who become somewhat less than competent bank-robbers in an effort to raise enough money to save their late mother's ranch. The brothers are Chris Pine and a brilliant Ben Foster, (surely one of the best actors working anywhere today), and an even better Jeff Bridges is the grizzled old sheriff on their trail. It's the kind of movie the Coen Brothers might have made but not improved on and it has a real feeling for the New Mexico landscapes where it was filmed, (it's beautifully shot by Giles Nuttgens), and you would never guess watching it that Mackenzie himself wasn't American. There's also a terrific Nick Cave/Warren Ellis score; the perfect package, in fact."
" A West Texas Classic
",2020-11-05 00:00:00,10,"A great cast, amazing story, and beautiful photography. As compelling as any other movie I've ever seen."
" Smart & Entertaining
",2020-10-22 00:00:00,7,"I didn't expect it to be that smart and good for a heist film. Fine acting especially from Jeff Bridges with a very well written plot and some good editing. Entertaining, pure and simple for a Thriller/Heist film."
" Wanna-be third rate No country for old men
",2020-09-14 00:00:00,1,"If you dig that movie, you'll like this one. If you don't, leave it taking dust."
" Mediocre Do something original
",2020-09-04 00:00:00,5,Feels like a TV movie. Produced be CBS Films so I guess that makes sense. Didnt finish it. I guess I'm too picky. I feel like I never like any movies anymore.Be original. Wow they robbed a bank. What an original premise.
" Well done
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,10,"Great balance of good acting, drama and occasional humor. Modern western storytelling in an all too real state of affairs."
" Really well done!!
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,8,"This movie is so Texas it's not even funny. This is real life for a lot of people out there and most people like me who have lived our whole lives in the big cities can't even wrap our brains around this way of living. But it sure makes for an interesting movie. Nothing fancy here, just real emotions, real drama, and a real good story. The acting is insanely good too! Absolutely worth the watch."
" Great all-round film
",2020-08-19 00:00:00,7,"Well acted story with some definite highlights throughout.
However the movie is completely stolen by the T=Bone Cafe waitress!!!
She should have been nominated best supporting actress :)"
" One of the best cowboy movie in modern times
",2020-08-19 00:00:00,9,"The film is far from fancy thing but this film is so good, they put old code of cowboy movie in the modern theme"
" Forget Dallas, Houston, and Austin, This Movie is TEXAS!
",2020-08-17 00:00:00,10,"That's it! You cannot get a full keg of Texas in a big city. Texas is hard and tough outside the city. Ft. Worth and San Antonio are still cities in Texas. But Texas is wide and natural. Hell Yeah to the writers, directors, and money men in an era when girls want to be boys, and boys don't know how to be men outside of the American West...On BOTH sides of the law. Thank you four years ago for keeping the culture based on the history alive even if it is fiction!"
" Bugs on the windshield of life...
",2020-08-12 00:00:00,9,"I saw somewhere that the difference between American film making and French Film making is that American films are plot driven and French films are character driven. I bring this up because of the number of really negative responses to this movie seem uniformly opposed to the plausibility of the PLOT of Hell Or High Water., which I guess is understandable, because the plots of most good-to-great films are not only plausible but can be schematically diagrammed and empirically proven to be %100 absolutely demonstrable as the GENUINE ARTICLE, narratively speaking...That this approach is complete nonsense in determining whether a movie has credibility or not should seem pretty obvious, but there are always hard-core narrative constructivists, the Anthony Scalias of pseudo-criticism, to wit: if nobody ever done this, then it's all a bunch of horse hockey.Plot is important; a narrative arc that is rational and symmetrically pleasing can be a beautiful thing. But, it's not the only thing. There are endless number of great films with plots that either make no sense, are hyper-inflated, are just plain silly or are just not plot-dependant. In the end, it doesn't matter, because story-telling is not about plot. Yes, the plot matters, but there is so much more that makes an engaging , interesting, and beautiful story in narrative film making.Hell or High Water is an excellent film. If your standards require that THE PLOT of a film adhere to narrow strictures of...whatever, then your viewing pleasure may be affected. If you like to observe people under pressure, exhibiting idiosyncratic characteristics that speak to the strengths and weaknesses that all of us have, then you might find this satisfying. I like it. A lot."
" An old fashioned serious western, meets Logan Lucky
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,10,"What an outstanding movie! ""They don't make 'em like this anymore"". It doesn't pander to any Hollywood 'wokeism' about what a modern movie should be about but neither does it stereotype these characters.There's no obvious 'good guys or bad guys' in this
movie which makes it far better. It's almost like True Grit meets Robin Hood. You'd think it's just a really old plot that's been used hundreds of times before. However, the main three or four characters are very different people and there's some brilliant subtle and clever acting going on. It's what gets left out and doesn't need to be said it overacted that shows.No overkill with the action scenes either, enough to make it interesting but keeping it realistic at the same time. It won't be to everyone's taste but if you're a 40 something year old guy who likes a 'real guy film' (No offence intended) and not endless syfy rubbish, I think you'll really enjoy it."
" As good as Bob-The-Movie-Mans review.
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,9,"Watched this movie after reading BTMMans review & concur fully, good thoughtful acting from a top drawer cast with lots of subtle and interesting interplay with all the characters and it works as good on film as it did on paper.
There are enough reviews here to give you the picture of the brothers & the chase so take the time to put the phone away, the beer down and give this your full attention and enjoy it all the more. I could easily have given it a 9.5 or even a 10, but my seat was a little uncomfortable so it only got a 9. Jeff Bridges is such a class act and extremely watchable plying his craft. One not to miss."
" Nostalgic heartbreaking masterpiece
",2020-07-03 00:00:00,9,"This film is as much about its exotic locations,costumes,eatery as it's about characters and regret they posses.
It's about people whom we rarely see..but they exist with pain with them"
" A Somewhat Real and Gritty Version of Western Movies
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,10,"This movie provides a fresh take on storytelling of a Western, if it may be counted as one. The initial 10 min of the movie could bore many in the audience. But once you are past that it provides a really great and gripping storytelling of these small town amateur robbers. The setting of West Texas also enhances the ruggedness and authenticity that this movie required. Along with quite an engaging storytelling. Credit to where it is due performances of both Chris Pine and Jeff Bridges is exceptional."
" You've seen it before many times, but it's a really well crafted derivative
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,8,"""Hell or High Water"" doesn't bring anything truly new to the cinematic canon, but it's well worth watching for the spectacular cinematography alone. Take a bunch of movies like ""Bonnie and Clyde"", ""Badlands"", and similar anti-hero flicks, skillfully mix them up real well, and toss in Jeff Bridges playing an idealized Jeff Bridges (he does in his sleep nowadays for a very solid paycheck), and you've got this film. I'm not making a back-handed compliment, just a simple observation. Frankly, this film grabs you and never lets go. It is exceptionally well-crafted and the landscapes alone make it worth the time. So I have no regrets about heartily recommending this film, even though it's fundamentally a long way from being original."
" Flawed but really good movie
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,8,"This is a terrific movie, especially if you like rural town dramas. Jeff Bridges is great.Would have given it an even higher rating if it wasn't for the no-so-veiled constant ""blame others"" narrative (in this case, blame the greedy banks for ruining small town America, so robbing them is OK). Give me a break. Here's a little advice: less is more, especially when it comes to your preaching about banks actually wanting to get their loans repaid, heaven forbid.Otherwise it is very entertaining and well acted."
" Worth the watch
",2020-06-19 00:00:00,6,"I don't think this is a great movie, but I like Jeff Bridges, so... The most interesting parts of this film come from the themes of white poverty and inequality which go hand in hand with the power of the financial institutions that hold these poor people by their throats. Chris Pine does a fine job of portraying his difficult relationship with his ex-con brother, his love for his boys, and his seething hatred for the system that has kept his family poor for so many generations. Though Bridges was nominated for an Oscar for this film, his role is captivating, mostly because he's Jeff Bridges and he plays these parts so well. Yet, his character seems to be unaware that he is part of the machinery that keeps the status quo in place. While Bridges sits on the front porch in an old wooden chair, his partner asks what he's doing, and Bridges replies, ""I'm practicing my future,"" by which he means his soon to be retirement. He too is a cog in the wheel, and we can't help but love the man for his honesty. A good film overall."
" Ben Foster should have won the Oscar for best supporting
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,9,"That's all I came to say, that and this film is in my top 20 all time"
" This is the movie while I'm seeing i didn't feel like I'm seeing film
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,9,How can i start? I out of word expressing my view of this film. The most perfect cinematography i have ever seen. And the story is so perfect that you Won't notice you are actually seeing a movie.And the ending it could not have been any better. Just PERFECT. The Direction so impressive with that modern western tone i felt like I'm seeing another masterpiece. Bow ya!It's a perfect movie to watch at a perfect night
" Bare bones, gritty, and really good!!
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,7,"This is not a flashy movie in the least bit. It's a very simple plot,, tie that in with a very fine cast and director,, and you've got a great movie!! Cops vs Robbers,,, who's gonna win?Go watch it!!!"
" Jeff Bridges
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,3,"What a speech failure Jeff Bridges has become as a parent is annoying to listen to, even if the film is good?"
" Remake of 1988 Miles from home
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,7,Good movie seems to be a remake of Miles from Home. So if you liked this check that one out.
" Boring as hell
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,3,"Good actors will confuse you. Movie was boring as hell. Kind of an OK storyline, but I already miss my 1.5h. I'm also confused about imdb 7.6 rating?"
" Dash to get Owned - or to get Even
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,8,"Only so often comes a flic, where everyone's a character, stars, co-stars, even the extras. Plot centers on fight between big money and the small guy, where you have to look outside the Law for uncompromising solutions. Anyone wants to know why Texas is called the ""Lone Star"" the people here provide you with the answers. Great thing here is the plot gets somewhat shaded by the personalities of those who take part. Not often you say that about a movie."
" Red Dead Resemption the movie!
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,10,"""Lord of the Plains.""Every time I watch this movie, I want to start up RDR2 again. It is the prime example of a modern western: bank robbing, Texas rangers, and Comanches! You can literally plop this story in the 1800s and it would still be awesome! My all time favorite western."
" Exceptional Performances, Particularily Bridges And A Wonderfully Flat Landscape
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,7,"A fine modern western, which doubles as a cops and robbers movie. I sometimes felt that it didn't quite get the notice it deserved, despite good reviews and awards. The performances by the three leads are all exceptional, though Bridges has rarely been better. (He almost seems born to play a Texas Ranger.) Though the film is set in West Texas, it was apparently shot in New Mexico, and to great effect. The flatness of the landscape and its small towns are one of the films best features."
" Quiet, honest, impressive, tensed and a very well made heist film
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,7,"There is nothing wrong in this film. Pace may be slow somewhere, but it is actually a well made heist film."
" Overrated snoozefest
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,5,"I can't quite understand how this movie is rated so high. If you can stay awake long enough, there's eventually some short-lived suspense, but I wouldn't feel right calling it an action movie. Most of the plot is predictable and the rest of it is ridiculous. When it tried to get clever, it just got absurd. It's like everyone is a MacGuffin; I couldn't care less if anybody in the movie got what they wanted or died. I did have higher expectations because of the score on here. Currently it's almost as high as No Country for Old Men, which completely blows this movie out of the water in every way. This movie is just average at best.. nothing special or new"
" hell or high water
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,7,"Hell or high water is a more modern day take on western genre but in a respectful way to a old west style and this film borrowed some of its charm from old movies of same type,like some people said trucks replaced horses in this film but still we got one scene that felt like some nice omage to westerns before,bridges was perhaps the most enterteining guy to watch but pine and foster were on completly different level from everyone else,expecely foster,pine was also very convincing in playing his part and his dynamic with older bro was great,hell or high water was a film that had some surprises in it,it also had some sad emotional ones,and in end i was satisfayed with film"
" Great Acting and a Great Script!
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,9,"Jeff Bridges is incredible! Chris Pine is exceptional. The story and script are perfected through Bridges and Pine. An incredibly original film with a simple, effective plot."
" We get it, banks are bad.
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,1,"So it's ok if people die, including a Texas Ranger, so the hero bank robber can get back at the greedy evil bank. Try to he a little less transparent."
" My Favorite Western
",2020-02-27 00:00:00,10,"I studied westerns in school, so I have some academic knowledge of them. And of all the westerns I have seen, this is my favorite. It is one of the only ones I have enjoyed so much that I watched it multiple times. It is very well done, great story, great actors, lots of action, lots of drama, very intense. Just an amazing movie."
" Hell Or High Water Review
",2020-02-27 00:00:00,8,"Hell Or High Water is a film directed by David Mackenzie that stars Ben Foster, Chris Pine and Jeff Bridges. Hell Or High Water manages to tell quite the compelling story despite trudging through the usual Western tropes thanks to a brilliant script written by Taylor Sheridan that fully fleshes out the characters thanks to the necessity of their actions being pushed forward due to dire circumstances. Chris Pine gives the best performance of his career and Jeff Bridges and Ben Foster follow closely behind. The music brilliantly sets the mood for a western Texas ravaged by depression and characters that aren't happy with their lives, I'd highly recommend listening to the score. The sound design and the shoot-outs and set pieces within the film are beautifully crafted almost as beautiful as the film's stunning choreography. Overall, despite the occasional trope or stereotype this film manages to do largely everything right as a film and is definitely one of the better westerns I've seen in recent memory."
" HoHW
",2020-02-20 00:00:00,8,"Once upon a time, I thought I didn't care for westerns but recent films like this are making me change my mind on that. Hell or High Water is absolutely a modern western and the tension, the intensity that this film generates is exceptional. Any time I'm watching a movie and feel like I'm holding my breath waiting for something to happen, that's a win to me and this definitely achieved that. Extra special is the way it takes the time to steep and breath in moments. This movie is in no rush to get where it's going and I appreciate that.This is one I absolutely want to revisit in the near future because I unfortunately wasn't able to give it my full attention but despitethat it was still a solid experience."
" Well crafted story
",2020-02-16 00:00:00,8,I finally took time to sit and watch this! From the opening to the end I enjoyed it! A well crafted story that doesn't give it all up front. Sad but very enjoyable film with great acting and direction!
" Excellent performances; compelling story ( A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10
",2020-02-08 00:00:00,10,"The classic modern day western that could be only done in Texas. Suspenseful, and clever. Jeff Bridges plays the perfect Texas Ranger, while both Chris Pine and Ben Foster bring a dynamic that made for an awesome adventure. They even managed to pull off the perfect Comanche reference which can only be fitting for a true American Western story."
" More than decent
",2020-01-31 00:00:00,8,"This is a More than decent flick. The U.S. And the old way of living is on the skids in West Texas. The land of the cattleman is now the land of the Indian casino,rapacious bankers, payday loans, get out of debt scammers and desperate small scale bank robbers. To keep the family ranch two neer do well brothers reprise a James gang hit and run raid on a chain of crooked banks. They launder their stolen money thru Indian casinos in Ok. Responding to this crime wave are two Texas rangers, the old one gruff, as usual, Jeff Bridges, the younger Alberto, a half Indian that takes a lot of crap from Bridges. Are they friends? Bridges thinks yes, but Alberto bears all the insults with dignity and maybe resentment. This movie is well acted and the scenery is a magnificent landscape dotted with man's detritus of broken down towns , defunct junk, and strip development crappiness. Oil and gambling are the two money makers in this area. The locals seem to retain a cranky stubborn Texas mentality and a proclivity for guns and violence. Bank robbers need to watch out for armed citizens that are not exactly great shots.I never heard of this movie and caught it on Netflix. It's part of a trilogy of modern westerns.8 stars."
" just good
",2020-01-30 00:00:00,6,"Nothing really stood out, but i enjoyed it. story is nice i guess. execution, just normal. performance, good but not outstanding. just a slightly above average film.6/10: eh good"
" A great movie that is not talked about enough
",2020-01-29 00:00:00,8,"Hell or high water is a great film that doesn't get talked about enough. Although the films admitted slow pace for the first 40 minutes it used that time to develop characters. Speaking of the characters, the preformces in this film are stellar, and the world around them feels loved in and real. I agree that this film is incredibly inspired by the Coen brothers masterpiece ""no country for old men"" I feel like this has different very different motivations behind the characters. Not to mention the incredible cinematography. Not to touch on spoilers but the last 30 minutes in this film is some of my favorite moments of film in the last decade, but not just the least 30 more specifically the last five minutes which a conversation between two characters that floored me. If I am going to complain I think it has little rewatch value and the slow place in the beginning although important got a little boring. In conclusion a great film and is on Netflix right now if you want to watch it."
" Evil, Authority and the Hero against hell or high water.
",2020-01-28 00:00:00,8,"The film has certain elements of the western genre but nothing pretentious in its narrative and technical aspects, it presents the story of two brothers against authority but all justified in favor of his family.The film begins in the middle of the action presenting the first robbery as the initiator of the story, setting elements such as the uncontrolled character of Tanner (Ben Foster), the focused attitude of Toby (Chris Pine) and the conservative and authoritative personality of the Ranger Marcus (Jeff Bridges). The three characters represent a psychological confrontation throughout the film between a person's desire, duty and purpose.The conflict or duality between right and desired is present from the beginning and reflected in all the characters of the town, such as the waitress capable of collaborating with the law but taking advantage of the crime of others. For this is how the main characters of the brothers are presented in an impoverished town and frustrated by the limits imposed on them to take advantage of the wealth under their feet, these brothers are the enlightened ones able to camouflage themselves in a system to take advantage, robbing banks of the same chain with those who will then make deals and practically, although unintentionally, mobilizing the people.We see the family commitment of both characters from the beginning for the death of their mother, it will be for the children of one of them that they going to steal again. Everything is controlled by the authority represented in a Ranger with a great ideal of commitment to justice, although rather it represents the ashes of a system that tries to maintain order.
The film continues its course focusing its intention on discovering the purposes of this triad of men, this will lead us to the climax of the film where the three intentions collapse staging with the last robbery. During this a hierarchy of the three characters is generated with their intentions.Tanner (Ben Foster), the character who steals for pleasure, accepts his sacrifice for duty with his brother. Ranger Marcus (Jeff Bridges) ends up disgusted even when he defeats his enemy and gets justice. And Toby (Chris Pine) who plays with the purpose of helping his family is the hero who does not seek his benefit and who manages to turn the system to the aid of others and for his survival."
" One of the best of 2016
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,8,Excellent film that does a great job executing a recycled story line. This is almost like watching a western that takes place in 2016.
" Are you guys stupid?!
",2020-01-22 00:00:00,8,"I went through plenty of negative reviews about this film. Most of them concerned about why the hell they were robbing banks when they're earning 50K!
I wonder why some stupid people failed to understand that they robbed banks to pay the mortgage, failing which could've led them to loose their ranch & they'll be left with NOTHING!! Earning came after paying off the debts they owned, not before GENIUS! It's that simple!"
" Surprising hit from 2016
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,8,One of the best westerns I've seen from the 2010's. The characters and acting are what really drive the film forward and propel it farther then I would have imagined this film would have gone. Gonna be watching this one as time goes on.
" A truly mesmerizing experience!
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,8,"2016 gave us some good thrillers. Hell or High Water does most of the things perfect - Setting the tone/atmosphere with the cinematography. Acting, oh my god, the acting (Ben Foster steals the show) and an engaging story. It may not have scenes you remember for years to come, but the quality of work put to the project shines through the screen - A truly mesmerizing experience!"
" A rare gem!
",2019-12-31 00:00:00,9,"Highly entertaining!
When you've binged through enough Amazon or HBO shows...
Or tire of scrolling through endless Netflix or SVOD titles....
Then do a search for Hell or High Water! This is an exceptional movie. Acting is outstanding. Career performances from Chris Pine and Ben Foster in a profound brother narrative. Jeff Bridges is as excellent as ever. The story is equally powerful - a clever and creative take on the bank heist trope.Had some issues with direction. For instance, SPOILER: Would have liked to have better explained Tanner's (Ben Foster's) kill shot. It's central to his character and the story but it's left too vague for me. But that's real nitpicking for an otherwise almost flawless movie. You will not be disappointed renting this one."
" The poverty!
",2019-12-26 00:00:00,8,I love how the Explained poverty. To solve One's problem can create another problem for someone else.
" A taut well-told story with a message for the banks
",2019-12-26 00:00:00,8,"Shades of Robin Hood with the banks playing the role of the Sheriff of Nottingham, played out in the flat countryside of West Texas and Oklahoma. Two serial bank robbers pursued by an unlikely duo of Texas Rangers head towards a tragic (in the Greek rather than the Hollywood sense) end.Excellent acting and a good scrip make this a movie to watch."
" Best Western in a decade
",2019-12-24 00:00:00,9,No country for old men but without the weight of the Coen brothers.
" It can be done!
",2019-12-15 00:00:00,10,"Ya see? Hollywood can still ""make'em like they used to"" if they have a notion. Great movie all around....one I will be watching over and over because i know I have more to absorb from this classic!"
" Well written and easy to watch
",2019-11-24 00:00:00,8,"Another very good modern western. Taylor Sheridan(Wind River, Sicario) knows what he's doing. It's easy to see why it was nominated for best picture. Very well made with a little social commentary. Absolutely worth watching."
" Where we came from...
",2019-11-15 00:00:00,10,"This movie, and No Country for Old Men, remind me of my father. It's hard to explain to other people, but there's a streak that runs through these movies that encapsulates where he came from, and what he taught me."
" Modern Cowboys
",2019-10-30 00:00:00,9,"Everyone brings their A game here, but most notable, is the ever-so-natural relationship between Bridges and cop partner Gil Birmingham. Bridge's character is full of endearing racial insults, which his partner is either content with or indulges in the banter in equal measure. And that's true friendship right there.
And when his partner gets shot at the end, damn.. I felt that loss. And the shock and sorrow was written all over Bridge's hard edged face as if it were real, with a dishevelled manner and appearance shortly after the incident only solidifying the performance as a whole.Also includes one of the better ending for this type of film.
Instead of leaving us with a predictable gun-firing last showdown, we have a mild and civil conversation between the two remaining protagonists (rivals) - one retired and mourning his friend and partner, the other mourning his brother and racked with guilt. Both now have nothing to lose. Both willing to avenge the death of someone they were close to.
It's a possible future showdown that we, the audience, don't need to witness.I love a film that's this good which can also surprise me along the way."
" Solid film. Great casting. Good writing. Great acting.
",2019-10-24 00:00:00,8,"Hell or High Water is a solid film that I believe many people will enjoy and relate to.PROS:
Great acting! Excellent casting! Great writing! Great action scenes! Good cinematography. Good character development. The old man in the bank made my day! You readily understand each character and their moral compass. Overall good (possibly great) package.CONS:
Pace is a bit too slow in some scenes for my taste, which could have been corrected by removing 10 or 15 minutes from the final cut. I think they spent too much time showing the bond between the brothers at their home. After a while, I wanted to tell the writers ""Okay! I get it! They are close. Can we please get on with the movie?"" I fast forwarded through about ten minutes of the movie. An example of a great film with similar pacing would be the old Bonnie and Clyde movie or No Country for Old Men. These hit the nail on the head.This film is definitely worth watching. The actors/characters were the embodiment of their roles. For me, the rating is a tough call between seven and eight stars. I also understand the nine and ten ratings if you simply love the setting or this type of film. The only reason I do not give this and other films a nine or ten is because they don't quite stack up against truly great films such as Shawshank Redemption, Saving Private Ryan, No Country for Old Men, Terminator 2, etc. These are the films I rated as nines and tens.Therefore, this film is a seven or eight, which is still very good on my scale. I try not to give away nine and ten star ratings like candy.If you prefer films filled with non-stop gun-play and carnage, you may not like this one as much as I did. If you like good writing and casting, you should enjoy this film."
" A West Texas Thriller! Must Watch!
",2019-10-16 00:00:00,10,"A modern-day West Texas noir that cuts out the special effects for real drama.As a West Texas native, I'm surprised at how close the scenery hits to home. The setting is as real as it can get. I cannot begin to start on the number of towns I've visited that resembled the ones in this film. But I digress.The characters themselves I enjoyed. There are no good guys in this film. Everyone has their motivations and reasons for doing the things they do. This is a modern Wild West cops and robbers chase.5/5. Worth it and will see it again. Shame that this movie did not receive the marketing that it deserves."
" Good movie, funny banter, not sure why nominated.
",2019-10-07 00:00:00,7,"I'll make this short and quick to save us time: the movie is good, but I have no idea why it's nominated. I understood the movie but maybe there's a symbolism somewhere that I didn't get. Two brothers, robbing banks so one can bankroll a project. Two brothers-in-arms, one retiring and is hoping for a last case to add a feather in his cap. Each set meets the same fate, and we're left with a set that may have finished their jobs but are not really done yet.Highlight of the movie includes the cinematography (it's nice to see America beyond the usual NY or LA backdrops, reminded me of 2013 Best Picture nominee 'Nebraska') and the banter between the characters of Best Supporting Actor nominee Jeff Bridges and his American Indian sidekick Gil Birmingham."
" Highly political, and close to perfect
",2019-10-02 00:00:00,9,"We all hate banks and usurers. God hates them, too. Warnings against usury go back to Exodus 22:24, and there are dozens of other scriptures with the same message._Hell or High Water_ addresses the effects of usury in a parochial setting (rural West Texas), but considering the mortgage crisis of 2007-08 and the ensuing market crash and government bailout, it delivers a universal message that we non-members of the ""one percent"" can all relate to.Therefore, we have a large degree of sympathy for the two brothers who rob branches of the bank that is about to foreclose on their ranch, to raise enough cash to pay the place off. Both actors, Chris Pine and Ben Foster, are perfect in their roles. They're an odd couple: Pine's character is thoughtful and cautious, but Foster is manic and likes robbing banks a little too much.On the other side, there is another odd couple, the sheriff and his deputy--ironically, a cowboy and an Indian--who are chasing the robbers around west Texas but are always one step behind. Jeff Bridges, as the older, wizened, close-to-retirement sheriff, has never turned in a better performance. And Gil Birmingham, as his half Mexican / half Native American partner and foil, grabs us from the first scenes and keeps us hanging on. We like him so much, we suspect that he's going to be a tragic character, and we're right.There are shades of _Bonnie and Clyde_ and _No Country for Old Men_, but this film stands firmly on its own, due its depth of characterization and its political message. It's not about crime; it's about people who are victimized by a merciless system.Extra kudos for the supporting cast: Katy Mixon as a saucy waitress in a Texas cafe, Margaret Bowman as the most obnoxious waitress of all time, and Buck Taylor as the old man in the bank who tries to shoot the robbers as they escape.In some movies, it seems that the actors know they are doing something memorable, and they perform to their utmost ability. This is one of those occasions.I guess there's there's no such thing as a perfect movie, but this one comes damn close. Everything is here: Intelligent scripting, great acting, emotional impact. You will not be disappointed. The ending is amazing!"
" 8 1/2 Stars
",2019-09-20 00:00:00,8,"It was a solid movie. Great acting and directing. The cinematography felt right. At no time did it lose my attention. The story unfolded well and explained its self in time. It left me with a sad feeling which I think is what it intended. I didn't give it a higher score because it just didn't have that something special say in comparison to "" No Country for Old Men"" but it's definitely a solid film."
" Good acting, boring movie.
",2019-09-05 00:00:00,4,"I was definitely underwhelmed by this movie. An all star cast and a promising start, but it just fizzled. Highly anti climatic and fairly predictable. Good acting from all, but they didn't have much to work with. The storyline was slow, the final shootout wasn't very cinematic, the movie just didn't have good flow."
" excellent!!
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,8,"I just saw this movie and oh Gosh, it´s excelent. Dialogues, situations, characters, all just fine. Before checking the name of the director, I had the feeling the Cohen brothers were there, but no. Anyway, impressive movie, to be kept in my video files..."
" Classic Western Set-Up in Present Day
",2019-08-21 00:00:00,7,"351. Hell or High Water. Have you ever wondered what a classic western style story would be like filmed today without much done to update the script? No, me either, until I realized that's exactly what I was watching... Story about two bank robbing brothers, Tanner and Toby Howard, raising enough cash to keep the bad bank man from taking the farm. Ya see, they struck oil on that land, not much, but enough to get by. Toby is the smart one, doing bad things for good reasons. Tanner is the wild card, doing bad things just to do bad things, but deep down, doing it for his brother! But coming up quick behind them is the law, Texas Ranger kinda law!! The old sheriff, Marcus Hamilton, just about to retire, and through pretty much intuition alone ends up in the right places at the right times, and with Marcus his Native American partner, Alberto, who is assaulted by the racist humor of the sheriff all day, but deep down, there's a bromance going on! And as Tanner and Toby continue their bank robbing ways, Tanner gets a little cocky takes on a bank full of people, shots fired, they barely escape with their lives, the townsfolk round up an armed posse to go after them chasing them up the road, but right around the corner is the sheriff, because deep down he knew where those pesky Howard boys were gonna strike next leading up to the ultimate showdown between the Texas Rangers and a couple of law breaking cowboys!! So this takes place in modern day, but it had the classic western set up. So if you're looking for a modern day western, go for it, looking for Heat, or Point Break, i'd say probably not.

" Oscar bridesmaid
",2019-08-15 00:00:00,9,The only conceivable reason this film did not win an Oscar for best picture and best actor in a leading role for Jeff Bridges is because it happened to be up against Moonlight. I have seen both films and couldn't say one is better than the other but Hell or High Water is more entertaining. Don't miss it ! ! !
" Excellent Modern Western/Crime Drama
",2019-08-12 00:00:00,8,"Two brothers are robbing banks with different motives as the law closes in. Set in modern day rural Texas the brothers must stay one step ahead of the law whilst dealing with Texas locals who aren't afraid to defend their towns.A highly enjoyable movie. All of the cast does a great job, providing some tense scenes mixed with a little humour here and there too. A solid crime drama that is well worth watching.I really enjoyed Thunderbolt and Lightfoot with Jeff Bridges, another modern western about robbing banks from the 70s. This time Jeff Bridges plays it more serious as the retiring policeman as opposed to bank robber.Chris Pine does a good job proving he can turn his hand to more grittier roles.I am a big fan of the coen brothers movies Blood Simple and No Country For Old Men. For me this movie will go on the same shelf.After recently whetting my appetite for westerns again with the sisters brothers, this movie has left me wanting to watch more."
" Hell or High Water- A story about the inevitable. (7.7)
",2019-07-12 00:00:00,8,"This movie is about much more than two brothers on a bank heist binge or than an old time sheriff and his Native-American partner. It is about the inevitable- it's about the way life continues on a bound circle. It is a nod of the hat to the struggles that we all undoubtably face in our lives. Wither its financial struggle, coming to the end of an era, death, or even that we are all under the influence our human desire to have more power-- there are some things in this life we just can not avoid. Hell or high water, they are bound to happen.The movie bases its story on the inevitable problems of money and debt. No matter who we are or where we are from, money will always be a factor. Though this creates the plot of the film, I do not believe it to be the over all arching theme to be strictly about money.Much of the plot is also based on the idea of ending era's. This is most obviously noticed with the intrinsic struggle of sheriff Hamilton and his fear of retirement.Death is another large part of this film. As a certain character in this film meets his death (I will not reveal who dies exactly to avoid large spoils), it feels as if it was meant from the begging. As if no matter what, this character was set on bound tracks to an early death.Finally, the most sneaky nod of the hat to the inevitable, the constant undertone of the human desire to have more power. This is most obviously noticed in the constant references to the Native American people and their stolen land. This is well portrayed by Alberto; who explains that the power struggle was once between the Native American's and the white people, but now the power struggle is fought between the everyday working person and the bank.Outside the hidden meaning of the script, this film has much to applaud-- Jeff Bridges being one of them. He not only transforms so brilliantly into a modern day Texas sheriff, he successfully pulls on the heart strings of everyone who watches this movie. He is truly one of the greatest actors.Director David Mackenzie masters the ""long take"" in this movie by letting the camera go on continuous shots, thus letting the actors create a realistic scene (the opening scene being a great example).The film's sets and locations make the audience feel as if they were actually there. The light blue Texas sky matched with the sun faded colors of the surrounding buildings make you feel like you are really in the heat of small town Texas. The worn out towns shot in motion as the characters drive effectively create the back drop for this story of small town suffering.The only noticeably negative aspect of the film is the cheesy feeling given off by one or two smaller role actors.Over all, I give the film a 7.7. I love the writing, I love the films meaning, I love Jeff Bridges as well as the other leading actors, and I love the Texas style realism. I give this film a high recommend."
" my notes

" Not Shot in Texas
",2019-06-27 00:00:00,3,"In addition to my review about this being an affront to Texas, it was filmed in New Mexico. In fact the same location as Breaking Bad's penultimate episode."
" What a great film
",2019-06-17 00:00:00,9,"A modest, realistic depiction of a few bank robberies. Well written with a sharp script, extremely well directed, and pulls at the heart strings."
" Great acting from a great cast
",2019-06-14 00:00:00,8,"I liked this film a lot because of a few things. The casting was great and the characters they played was great too. 3 A list actors who complimented each other rather than fighting for screen time was really nice to see. The old meeting the new ( generationally speaking ). Two scumbag brothers think they're doing the right thing by robbing banks to pay off the mortgage, not caring or not giving a second thought to the people they're traumatising, go on a rampage of thieving and violence. An old cop and his pissed off partner try their best to get one step ahead of them and in doing so just proves why he needing to retire. Too old and too slow. Great film and definitely worth a watch."
" Happy ending, worth watching.
",2019-06-09 00:00:00,8,"A decent modern day western. Character development was done very well. However, this leads to some slow spots throughout the movie. Could have been paced a little better. Overall a good movie worth watching."
" Happy ending, worth watching.
",2019-06-03 00:00:00,8,One of my favorite movies of all time. Hell or High Water has accomplished a feat of something I cannot put into words. It is the perfect movie. It deserved best picture.
" Brothers Bound By Lawlessness
",2019-05-24 00:00:00,8,"Mackenzie helms his best film to date. Sheridan's screenplay is flawless. This film has excellent direction, cinematography, screenplay, settings, score and acting. Pine, Foster and once again Bridges deliver superlative performances. This is a virtuous drama / thriller set in modern day Texas. Pine and Foster portray two characters at the opposite sides of the spectrum but whose brotherhood outweighs all else. Toby is a divorced honest father and his older brother Tanner is an ex-con. The film starts out explosive as the two brothers set out to commit a series of bank robberies in order to save the family ranch. Toby is in it strictly for his family but Tanner is in for more. He is a thrill seeking reckless outlaw. The brothers pull off a series of daring well planned robberies which catches the eye of a Texas Ranger. Bridges portrays Marcus, a cunning retiring Texas lawman whose seen and done it all. Marcus' innate abilities quickly put him on the trail of the bandits. The brothers have laundered the stolen money, buried the getaway car and returned to the family ranch. They ingeniously have a check made out to the bank that holds a mortgage on the ranch which has now been discovered to be rich in oil. Toby is hell bent on keeping the ranch in the family so that his ex-wife and children can live comfortably. The plan is to now rob one last bank which is a branch of the bank that holds the mortage that they deposited the check into. It is a brilliant duplicit act of justice for the brothers. Eventually Marcus, having the gut instinct to be at the right place at the right time, catches up to the brothers after the heist goes awry and innocent people are killed by Tanner. An epic western showdown occurs with only one brother surviving. Marcus visits the ranch at the end, which is now producing more money in a month from it's wells than all the robberies combined. He has a candid conversation with the surviving brother and the brother suggest they continue their conversation soon which leaves the ending ambiguous. In this viewer's opinion Marcus and Toby will meet up again come hell or high water. It's a masterful examination of the lawless versus the law. This film is intense, gritty, raw, blazing, realistic, violent, poetic, memorable and has a cathartic ending. This is a bravura work of art and one of the finest films in it's genre."
" Go for Broke.
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,7,"A western in the era of the great recession. Hell or High Water is quality cowboy action with enough social commentary to give it an extra kick. An excellent study on what drives people to become common criminals. The two brothers on the run commit evil deeds, but aren't necessarily evil themselves, if you catch my drift. Jeff Bridges lights the screen on fire as a crusty old sheriff who's seen it all."
" Neo-Western at Its Best
",2019-05-02 00:00:00,8,"Hell or High Water captures the sheer intensity and reality of becoming a lawbreaker out of quite desperation and even though you are aware of this movie's obvious ending, you still care about the people in the story who will have to face that ending. It's nuanced, beautifully filmed, nicely restrained, and meditative."
" Phenomenal Film
",2019-04-30 00:00:00,9,"The once peaceful lands of Western Texas have been surrendered into the control of the Texas Midlands Bank; forever dominating the people's wealth. A family's ranch is in jeopardy when tough circumstances meet brutal enforcement. Brothers, Toby and Tanner Howard must face the debt their mother leaves behind to keep their ranch. Beneath the land lies black gold which will end their poverty. Before they can progress, they must satisfy the bank's demands whether or not their methods are legal.Many and if not all of the best criminal films do not compare to the dry and dire nature that Hell or High Water depicts. The movie starves itself from the traditional happy-go-lucky plot leaving a crude and lawful journey to follow. In comparison, Escape from Alcatraz also depicts the dependability of family and the desire for change that drove the inmates to commit crimes. Hell or High Water challenges typical crime films with a different approach at success; sacrifice to break the shackles of poverty.
Generally, crime is one of the most difficult genre to depict in a film without excessively including fatuous events, characters, and plots. Many crime films obsess with including comedic and impractical scenarios that spoil the thrill of a crime film. Tom Cruise's
""American Made"" was a true disappointment because the realistic events beneath the film held great potential; a common airline pilot recruited by the CIA in order to bring down the Medellin Cartel finds a new interest in the commission from smuggling drugs. Historically, the twisted events of Barry Seal's recruitment would appear fictional and that is exactly how it is depicted in the film. Likewise, Clint Eastwood's ""Escape from Alcatraz"" took a mushy approach representing the infamous convicts who escaped the inescapable. ""Escape from Alcatraz"" and ""Hell or High Water"" share the same grand scheme plot but only one of them captures the anticipation and excitement of the process. Furthermore, the advancement of the film industry allowed Hell or High Water to nail criminal films spot on by making the audience feel like they're in the moment. Somehow a sense of connection develops as you learn the principle of the film and witness the phenomenal acting.What makes Hell or High Water unique is the storyline that is told in a duel perspective. Throughout the film we see the Sheriff and his Deputy pursuing Toby and Tanner after they blow their cover. Generally, law enforcement is seen as a side or background aspect to a criminal film that appear when convenient. However in the virtually lawless land of Western Texas it's the Sheriff's personal conquest to glorify his last days with his badge. As for the Howard Brothers they have one goal in mind; keep their ranch and ensure a wealthy life for their family. The wholesome plot of the film makes Hell or High Water change how we see crime and the importance of family to some.Mackenzie, a relatively new director, makes a return since his last hit: ""Starred Up,"" which follows a young offender through his timeline in custody. Prior to Hell or High Water or Starred Up, Mackenzie has only directed 6 other films none of which affiliate with crime. However all his films share the surreal realism of the stagecraft and portrayal of characters. CGI is praised for its tactility in portraying situations such as firefights, explosions, narcotics, and decent size land modifications. Yet CGI adds a cartoony aspect to a film that is supposed to feel live action. Mackenzie cleverly avoids using CGI making the film incredibly realistic. Gunfights in the film follow the stereotypes of Texan gun owners but in a way that adds to the story showing the feral turf of Western Texas. Additionally, the entire process of Toby and Tanner's heists is shown with minimal offscreen assumptions unlike other criminal films. In the end Hell or High Water does a spectacular job with its acting which makes me crave a sequel.Hell or High Water deserves a showtime for everyone even those with little interest. Ridded of cliche plots and CGI overkill, there is a laundry effect from the first to the last minute of the film. This film is remarkably a token of Mackenzie and a valid landmark for his 10th film. Rather than settling for big name faces and over advertised films experience crime without greed and glory instead for a greater purpose."

",2019-04-04 00:00:00,10,04/04/2019 This is a great movie that will become a classic in time. So much going on that you won't want it to end. Every actor was perfect for their given part but Jeff Bridges really shined. A truely great movie that I've already watched multiple times and will again in the future. Watch for yourselves and decide. Bon Appetit
" High praise due for Hell or High Water ; excellent story, acting scenery
",2019-03-15 00:00:00,8,"In the dry plains of West Texas, Toby (Chris Pine) has enlisted his brother, Tanner (Ben Foster) in a grand scheme of deception. They will rob banks, with ski masks, until they have enough money to reverse a ""reverse mortgage"" with which a bank fleeced their newly deceased mother. Not just any bank, the bank branches of the offending financial institution. Tanner, an ex-con, just wants the thrill of the plan but Toby wants to save the ranch for his two sons. What's more, they have planned it out in many ways to cover their tracks, such as burying getaway cars. Naturally, after the first two successful robberies, the Texas Rangers are called in. Marcus (Jeff Bridges) is on the verge of retirement; his partner, Alberto (Gil Birmingham), a half-Comanche, wishes he was about to rock in a rocking chair. By studying the methods used so far, Marcus gets an idea about what bank may be next. What's more, Tanner does one job on the spur of the moment and leaves clues. As the brothers get closer and closer to completion, will Marcus find them first? This excellent, sometimes violent, film has one sensational story. But, likewise, the cast is fabulous, the scenery is vividly desolate, and the direction is smooth. Are you a fan of old Westerns and cat-and-mouse plots? You will find H or HW a dream come true."
" A modern twist to a standard bank heist archetype.
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,8,"It's interesting to me to see how the current social climate in this country can mold a film into a Best Picture Oscar nominee. I've probably seen this same scenario a number of different times, but the reasoning behind it is what brings Hell or High Water (2016) into a different category. There have been tons of heist films, and often the robbers have a tight connection, like that of brothers. Heck, The Blues Brothers (1980) essentially did the same basic plot but with ""putting the band back together"" as their way of ""saving the ranch.""Partly because this film seemed so quintessentially Texas, I couldn't help thinking it was a toned down version of another Best Picture Oscar winner No Country for Old Men (2007). With last year's Best Picture Oscar nominee, The Big Short (2015), showing how many honest Americans were swindled by the greed of banks, it's no wonder that this year we would see the more down-to-earth side of this financial fiasco. Not only are these robberies meant to save their home, these brothers also wanted to ""stick it to the man"" that put their family in such dire straits to begin with.In the end, Hell or High Water is a pretty standard plot and it's pretty predictable from the beginning to the credits. However, when the citizens of these towns aren't concerned that their banks are being robbed and they begin to side with the robbers, you know there's something wrong with the society. Granted, this society in Texas was hit hard by the recession, so it's no wonder that they don't trust the banks that are being knocked off. It's realizations like this that help to show why a presidential candidate practically backed by big banking did not win last November.A modern twist to a standard bank heist archetype, I give Hell or High Water 4.0 stars out of 5."
" It's about time!
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,10,"This is the movie I've been waiting for. I'm not going to say much here except take the time and see it for yourself. Jeff Bridges is fantastic as always, a great cast on top of a great story with the best ending possible.
I was hoping it would end this way, and it did and I'm so happy!!!"
" Absolutely Amazing
",2019-02-26 00:00:00,10,"I'm actually upset at anyone who has ever seen this film and didn't tell everyone they know to go watch it that very second. Ok, that is a pretty big statement, but wow.I haven't really been a huge Chris Pine fan, as a matter of fact, I've always considered him to be just another pretty face. Well, here I am, standing corrected. He absolutely brings it in this film. Also, Ben Foster...i can't describe how scary it is at the accuracy he portrays a west Texas/Oklahoma boy. As an Oklahoman myself, I know about 10 different guys who act just like his character. Typically you may look at his portrayal as a little over the top, but I think he nailed it.The movie was the right amount of tense, drama, and interesting. Often times I find my biggest complaint to be that a movie is too short, that they didn't stretch out a storyline enough, but this script hit all the marks for me in the amount of time it was offered.Amazing, absolutely will watch again."

" Excellent acting and edgy humor
",2019-02-15 00:00:00,9,"Bridges, Pine and Foster all control the screen with their respective roles. Foster especially because his comedic relief helped kind of off-set the seriousness of Bridges and Pine. While it may not be the most original film script wise, It is a very satisfying and complete one. Well worth watching and I would highly recommend."
" Brotherhood's Role in Humanity
",2019-02-14 00:00:00,10,"FAMILY. THEFT. JUSTICE.Hell or High Water can be summarized by these three words. Directed by David MacKenzie, Written by Taylor Sheridan, and starring veteran actors Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine, Ben Foster, and Gil Birmingham this film was nominated for four different Oscars and received multiple other awards from various film festivals. Taylor Sheridan's original screenplay was one of the aspects of this film nominated for an Oscar and it was deservedly so. Every piece of dialogue in this film is essential either to the characters' development, further enriching the world the film takes place in, or helping to keep the plot moving forward. An interesting aspect of the writing for this movie is that many of the best lines are in fact ad-libbed and Sheridan purposefully left many scenes open-ended in order to allow for the actors to add their own flare to the characters. When a writer does this, it can either take the film to an entirely new level or sink its chances of every getting off the ground. Much to the relief of the filmmakers and joy of the fans of this movie, the scenes that do sport unplanned dialogue only complement the lines written. Chris Pine and Ben Foster star as Tanner and Toby Howard respectively, two brothers who were forced to grow up depending and protecting one another from their harsh reality. Taking inspiration from classic Western leading men, Chris Pine plays Tanner Howard as a closed-off, cautious, desperate man who says more with his body language and facial expressions than with his voice. Ben Foster embodies Toby Howard as the exact opposite of his little brother, a recently freed felon who is completely comfortable with who he is and indulging in every whim that crosses his mind. After spending every last cent his family didn't have on treating their mother's cancer, Tanner is desperate to keep the family ranch out of the hands of greedy bankers looking to seize upon his family's misfortune. This desperation is furthered by the discovery of liquid gold, oil, on the property and Tanner realizes that if he doesn't pay back the loans owed to the bank, his sons will be forced to live in the same poverty he and his brother grew up in. Together they come up with a plan to rob branches of the very bank threatening to take their land and after they successfully complete their first robbery they are set on a collision course with the two other main characters of the story. Jeff Bridges takes on the role of the gruff, shrewd Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton, a man staring down the long, lonely barrel of retirement forced upon him by his superiors. Bridges masterfully steps into the literal cowboy boots of Hamilton, bringing to life not only the aging Ranger's desire for one last hoorah but also showing the character's calculating lawman side honed by years of facing the worst of humanity. Gil Birmingham fills out the main cast as Texas Ranger Alberto Parker, the long-suffering half Comanche, half Mexican partner to Bridges' Hamilton. Birmingham and Bridges play well off of each other, the banter between them coming across as not only natural but believable. Ranger Parker is the assigned partner of Ranger Hamilton and finds himself having to deal not only with Hamilton's off-color jokes regarding his heritage but the man's assured nature stemming from the Ranger's many years of experience. Taking his barbs good-naturedly, Parker gives just as much as he gets and although he butts heads with Hamilton, he respects the man and his knowledge of how to anticipate the criminals' next move. These two sets of brothers are set on a colliding course, one defined by blood, the other defined by friendship and mutual respect and the only way it ends is with blood. After successfully robbing a number of banks, the Howard brothers come across the last bank they will need to hit, the largest of their list of targets. Unfortunately for all of those involved, they charge in while the bank is packed with patrons. As they rush to grab the cash they will need to complete their plan, a security guard they don't initially see and an armed citizen shoot at the brothers, prompting Toby to kill both men and drag his shell-shocked brother out of the bank with the bag of money. Finding themselves surrounded by armed Texas residents, the brothers evade capture but not before Tanner is shot in the side. After an emotional goodbye, the brothers separate, Tanner going to exchange the money at an Indian Casino across the state line in Oklahoma while Toby leads their pursuers on a wild chase through the Texan wilderness. Rangers Hamilton and Parker arrive on the scene as Toby uses his higher vantage point to rain down rifle fire on those chasing him. In the crossfire, Ranger Parker is shot and killed instantly with a shot to the head. Seeking justice, Hamilton jumps into a truck with one of the locals still chasing after the Howard brothers and enlists his help in flanking Toby. With his full attention kept in front of him, Toby doesn't realize the danger at his back until it is too late. Taking a 500 yard shot, Ranger Hamilton shoots Toby through the head, killing him where he sits. Both Tanner Howard and Marcus Hamilton are forced to deal with the deaths of their brothers, living in grief and feeling as though they no longer have any reason to carry on. Tanner pays off his family's debts and the land is saved, oil drills quickly popping up to pull up the source of his family's salvation. Now officially retired, Marcus can't ignore the fact that the case will forever go unsolved so he resolves to pay Tanner a visit. What follows is one of the best acted and most tense scenes in the film as both men, both of whom have lost so much to each other, discuss the aftermath of everything. With the arrival of Tanner's ex-wife and sons the tension is broken temporarily, until both men promise an end to their entanglement should the other wish to visit where the other lives, gun in tow. Family drives many to do things they never thought they would do. The theft and changing of hands of the land, from the Native Americans to the homesteaders responsible for helping settle the United States, to the farmers and landowners being forced to foreclose and return the land they poured their blood, sweat, and tears into back to the bankers who loaned them the money for said land. Finally, the justice of taking the life of the man who killed one's own brother, an eye for an eye, a life for a life. David Mackenzie, Taylor Sheridan, and composers Nick Cave and Warren Ellis craft an incredible tale of just how far two brothers are willing to go in order to provide for their family and the two brothers willing to stand up for the law. Everything about this film fits together seamlessly, from the direction to the writing to the use of music and song to help portray the emotions seen on screen, Hell or High Water is a stark look at what it means to be human and how much or a role brotherhood plays in defining humanity."
" Great acting; weak plot
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,6,Bank heist movie with a weak plot. Some of my favorite actors subjected me to intense boredom. The movie has some good moments but just watch this if you've run out of things to do. Too slow and predictable for me
" Disappointing despite stellar cast
",2019-01-29 00:00:00,3,"I was really looking forward to this movie. Given this cast, what could go wrong? As it turns out; several things can go wrong. A tepid plot I could never feel vested with and a wretchedly slow pace that even the iconic Jeff Bridges could not distract me from. If you want to see this genre done correctly just watch No Country for Old Men again."
" Enjoyed
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed this movie. I am not sure why I kept passing it up. Great acting, casting, directing. Great plot with a twist on Robin Hood. A sense of justice. I recomend"
" Sucked - very boring

" Weak
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,4,Very predictible Horrible ending. With a great case I expected more.
" Great
",2019-01-25 00:00:00,8,Great movie with great chemistry between the main two characters. They really seem like brothers with an interesting past and everything about their relationship and past history is real. The old cop and the native american cop is the same situation. They feel like real partners and it certainly adds to your caring about how the whole situation plays out. Loved the end scene with Chris Pine and Jeff Bridges.
" Work of art
",2019-01-24 00:00:00,10,"This movie is excellent. The most striking thing to me was the cinematography. You could take a screen capture at just about any point in the movie and have a photo worth framing. It's stylistically excellent, and was a work of art visually. The writing was great, especially in the sense of the character personalities. Every character had depth and interest. I wouldn't call it a twist ending by any means, but I thought I had it called and I didn't. The music added a lot as well. If you like darkish new-westerns, this is definitely worth considering."
" YES!!
",2019-01-24 00:00:00,8,"That was what I was thinking when I was watching this movie. When I think that in my head, all the way until the end, I know I've stumbled upon a good one.I originally didn't know much about Chris Pine when I first saw this movie. But he shines really bright as a bank robber in this movie, trying to raise enough money to save his house from foreclosure. It's a tale of the robbers who rob, and the cops who try to stop them. A great piece on capitalism in the US, and chasing the American Dream.Highly recommended. I mean the first shot in the film is enough to make you go nuts!8 stars"
" Perfect
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,10,Start to finish. A fine example of incredible talent hitting on all cylinders. Hat's off to everyone involved.
" A Real Movie With Even More Real Actors
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,9,"It's been some time since we've seen a movie like this. A simple story with good guys and bad guys with a good excuse. Nothing fancy here, you may even guess the end, but it won't disappoint. Jeff Bridges plays an ideal Texas Ranger that's at the end of their career. Gil Birmingham is the other Texas Ranger that's counting the days his partner(Jeff Bridges)retires. Chris Pine and Ben Foster are fabulous playing the brothers on a mission. Long and short, the film and the cast deliver."
" A impactful modern western
",2019-01-17 00:00:00,9,"Taylor Sheridan's (writer) Hell and High Water is one of the best films in the past few years. This was my second viewing, and it sat deeper and more profoundly with me. Not a single performance is weak or superfluous. It's location and tell-tale times of economic insecurity are as much a character as the bank tellers, waitresses, and worn cowboys are. Chris Pine, the electric Ben Foster, and most notably, Jeff Bridges, navigate the dry roads and open expanse of east Texas. Every scene has impact and develops the characters, every exchange of dialogue in their perfect drawl just fits - as if you can only nod at its simple wisdom. The movie sticks; and if ever you find yourself crossing the great state of Texas on their long, straight roads - this film may very likely make its way into your musings."
" Modern western
",2019-01-15 00:00:00,9,"Having lived in Texas it is very easy to relate to the story and locale. Thought I was sitting down to a B movie but it just kept getting better and better. Great acting and wonderful story. Excellent videography, I really liked the shot with the still windmill in the foreground. In real life the ending would have been a bit different, but it is a good story to tell anyway. Recommended watching."
" Great modern western
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,9,"This film gives you a western kind off feel but it's very modern...a pair of brothers who's mother just died get together to save the ranch she had owned. She had remortgaged and had fat cat bankers foreclosing on it, money is needed fast as they are close to losing it. The older brother Toby is played by Chris Pine, he is divorced but the ranch has been left to his two sons. The younger brother just released from jail for robbery is Tenner played by Ben foster and he and Toby have to raise the money owed and fast.They decide to rob banks to get the money and not just any bank but the bank chain that are going to take the ranch. So it's kind off ironic that the money stolen from them is going to pay the debt off.Bring in a fab actor Jeff Bridges and throw him into the mix as an old law enforcer and a good story and you can't go much wrong.The film is action packed, a bit of dark humour, a surprise end and it really is a good entertaining film. You certainly won't be bored with this one. I gave it a 9/10"
" Amazing cinematography, acting and screenplay
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,10,Amazing colorgrading also. the acting is so good. I really loved the charakters. also nice comedic parts. Not one single boringoment.
" Slow moving and subpar plot
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,5,"There were some good moments and Chris Oine and Jeff Bridges did well in their parts. But overall plot was lacking. Also, why do you have to diss on soccer? Only the biggest sport in the World!"
" Gripping Story & Great Cast
",2019-01-11 00:00:00,9,"A modern Western the way we want it. A gripping story without any lengths and some really well played characters.Driven by classical motives such as family, survival, comradeship and revenge this movie builds up wonderfully until it's classic western-showdown.On the edge of the story the movie touches today's challenges in the west and confronts the viewer and the characters with its bloody past.Highly recommended and for sure a future classic of the genre."
" Great everything
",2019-01-09 00:00:00,9,"A great storyline, which carries the viewer along at a good pace throughout to the more than satisfactory ending. The location footage is brilliant as is the music.
I thoroughly enjoyed the film."
" A Must-Watch Post-Western Epic About Two Brothers on Redemption's Trail
",2019-01-09 00:00:00,9,"Two brothers of contrasting personalities set out for a similar goal, yet with differing motivations. They are: Toby (Chris Pine) and Tanner (Ben Foster) - the smart and the stupid - the cerebral and the primal; the brothers team up to rob some banks, consequently for another duo on the other side of the law - Marcus (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto (Gil Birmingham) - to chase after them for a run time of less than 1 hour and 50 minutes, of slow, but thrilling sequences delivered with witty, comedic and sometimes, sentimental dialogues without any lack of the gun-banging that is typical of westerns. However, this is no typical western; a cynical take on the genre, quite akin to the modern classic - No Country for Old Men - despite the differences in themes both represent, both were nurtured by the blissful hands of excellent cinematographers, capturing shots of sweeping landscapes and intense, nail-biting scenes - complementing the surprising, but fantastic performances from Pine and Foster and a resembling re-enactment of the legend himself, Bridge's famous roles, which is not a disadvantage to the film, especially not when paired with Birmingham's wry portrayal of an Indian character - who has to live through Marcus' constant spews of racist jokes, but not without Alberto flinging them back at him, which makes for some comedic back-and-forth-s that are much needed following somber moments. They share an interesting dynamic, however, the sentimentality of it all seeps through the brothers more often - not solely for the fact that they are brothers, even if it is a major contribution to my experience. I relished the subtlety of the performances, having them to transcend the film to an emotional family drama. Director David Mackenzie has been successful at creating this magnificent modern and realistic representation of the post-western genre that would not have been a likely possibility if well-reputed screenwriter, Taylor Sheridan wasn't at the helm of this script. Alas, it is a product assuredly deserving of its praise and your time."
" For those negative reviewers who clearly didn't understand the financial aspects.
",2019-01-08 00:00:00,9,"This was a great movie. I'm not going to address that here, as it has been done elsewhere. However, a few negative reviewers panned the film on the basis of the financial motivation of the robberies, which they appeared to misunderstand. Some seemed to think the farm was being ""seized for back taxes""-- it wasn't. some thought it was a ""foreclosure""-- wrong again.No, actually, the farm was subject to a ""reverse mortgage"" with a buy-out option. In a reverse mortgage, the owner is payed a monthly amount BY the bank (rather than paying money TO the bank, as in a regular mortgage), while continuing to live in the home. At the end (usually based on the death of the owner), the home becomes the property of the bank. In this case, the family had a brief window in which to buy back the home, after the death of the owner, which was to expire within a few days of the robberies (hence the rush to get the money).Of course, the goal of the buyback was not to ""save the farm"", but to have the family gain from the very lucrative oil lease payments."
" Solid flick

" Bridges's final chapters
",2019-01-04 00:00:00,8,"I think Bridges is finding his last niche in this one. A great, small cast. The subject matter was touching. A modern TX Robin Hood."
" Overrated
",2019-01-04 00:00:00,3,"I was very excited to view this film, after having read about how good it was. I found a film that was not compelling or even mildly interesting, lazily acted and shot in what appears to be the armpit of the planet. The 'story' was silly. The two brothers were annoying and uninteresting redneck scum. The two cops were mildly interesting, but their schtick wore very thin very quickly. After seeing the wonderful Wind River and the pretty good Sicario, I expected much more from Taylor Sheridan's script. Actually, , and to be fair, I did not watch the entire movie, so, if it got better after the first forty minutes or so, well shame on me!"
" Nice Smooth Well Done Movie-Loved It
",2019-01-03 00:00:00,9,"01/03/2019 Exceptional movie/storyline, excellent, life like acting, especially Jeff Bridges (he definitely made this movie great). Realistic good guys versus realistic bad guys. Do NOT pass this movie by, it's one of the hidden gems we look for. Bon Appetit"
" Wholesome family drama.
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,7,"Wonderful performances across the board, each actor played a role in supporting this story. The rogue nature of Texas presented within is quite entertaining and the atttitudes of all within reflect a reality that feels very realistic. Action, drama, wholesome fun, and an emotional honesty that deliver a solid film. Watch this if you root for the underdog and enjoy a rowdy film."
" ""Because you asked, little brother""
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,10,Probably the best movie of 2016 and it should've won the Oscar. One of the best movies I've ever seen and one of a very few that I still put on once or twice a year and probably always will because it's that good. Bridges is amazing as expected but it's Pine and Foster and their brother character's bond that puts it over the top for me. Great performances and the movie gave me a new respect for Pine. Original plot putting a twist on the bank robber movie. I still can't believe so many of my friends haven't seen it.
" An intense and complicated film
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,8,"Hell or High Water is an intense and complicated film. I found myself rooting for Chris Pine at certain points in the story, and then, at other times, I was rooting for Jeff Bridges - both of whom give fantastic performances. This is a slow burn movie with plenty of suspense."
" Brilliant
",2018-12-23 00:00:00,8,Very good modern western movie. Kudos to Jeff Bridges and Ben Foster performances.
" A worthy modern addition to crime cinema.
",2018-12-03 00:00:00,8,"Chris Pine is quite good in the role of Toby Howard, a divorced young man who, after the death of his mother, knows that the Texas Midlands Bank is going to take possession of his family's land. Rather than let that happen (and feeling that he has no other option), he hooks up with his reckless ex-con older brother Tanner (a typically excellent Ben Foster), and they set out to rob the various branches of the bank. Picking up their trail is a weary old Texas Ranger named Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges, in fine form), who's set to retire, and his partner, Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham).""Hell or High Water"" starts out serious but still fairly light, turning darker and more serious as the story progresses and blood starts getting spilled. While we may be rooting for our protagonists, we can't help but feel that they can't stay ahead of the law forever, and wait for the inevitable. There is a sombre quality to the screenplay by Taylor Sheridan (writer of ""Sicario"", who also has a cameo as a cowboy), underscored by a haunting, melancholy soundtrack by Nick Cave & Warren Ellis. Commendably, it treats its characters as real and flawed human beings (including Tanner), and is largely believable, only turning more formulaic towards the end.Until then we get many pretty widescreen shots of New Mexico, some brief bursts of action & violence, a colourful assortment of supporting and background players, and engaging performances by the main four players. Bridges is admittedly once again essaying one of the ""mumbling Southerner"" characters that he seems to have grown fond of playing, but he brings a certain gravitas to the role and the scenario. He also supplies a heavy dose of sardonic humour as he teases his more straight-laced partner Birmingham. And speaking of Birmingham, he contributes such a natural, winning presence, that one hopes that this performance will help his career go even further. And Pine & Foster do well as the contrasting siblings, acting in a plot where the greed-heads at the banks are treated as the real villains.Overall, this is a fine film that people should check out.Eight out of 10."
" An impressive modern western
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,9,"Following the death of Toby Howard's mother it looks as though the Texas Midland Bank will foreclose on the family ranch. To raise the money required he decides to take it from Texas Midland Bank with the help of Tanner, his criminal brother. They quickly rob two branches and soon Marcus Hamilton and Alberto Parker, a pair of Texas Rangers are trying to find them. Toby has planned things well but Tanner is far more reckless; as an example he robs another bank while Toby is eating in a diner. After their final robbery doesn't go according to plan a confrontation with the law seems inevitable.This film may be set in the present but it feels very much like a western... and not just because of the Texas setting and presence of men in cowboy hats. The plot too feels like a western with our two protagonists fighting back against those trying to force them off their family land and the two Rangers after them. The story is well told and even though the Howard brothers are clearly breaking the law it is hard not to feel some sympathy for them; especially as we are constantly reminded that the recession is biting hard in this part of Texas. The cast does a really fine job; most notable Chris Pine who is great as Toby; if I hadn't seen his name on the credits I'd never have guessed that this was the 'new' Captain Kirk I was watching! Ben Foster is solid as Tanner. Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham are a lot of fun as bickering Rangers Hamilton and Parker. While the story isn't 'action packed' it does have some good moments of action; these provide some shocks and believable violence. Overall I really enjoyed this and would recommend it to fans of crime drama looking for something a little different."
" A rare gem, somewhat hidden
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,10,"The movie is chick full of memorable lines. Interesting plot carries the movie along, the characters are the foundation. The relationship of the 2 brothers, the 2 Texas Rangers, the cinematography, the music."

",2018-11-10 00:00:00,7,"Perhaps a bit overhyped though. Performances were great, but Bridges insistence in the end made little sense to me. I'd say generally after the two brothers scheme succeeded the film was over for me. Unfortunately not for the director."
" Disappointing and if you are not a fan of the actors in it - Don't watch it
",2018-11-06 00:00:00,5,"You can't say that Pine is leading in anything here, Foster has his stupid death like always and Bridges delivers the same voice like in any of his parts so there is nothing much to see here. 4 Oscar Nomination and for me I just can't see it. The idea is kinda good to get back at the banks that basically have become thieves which is a modern topic but you don't get the feeling that the good guys won since once of them is dead and the retired cop with nothing to loose is hunting for the living brother so I don't know for everyone else but I was not impressed and the best thing maybe is the quick and short scene so the movie don't make you feel that its being dragged like in movies that are hour and a half but you had the feeling that 2+ hours passed."
" True to its Texas core
",2018-10-25 00:00:00,9,"Superbly written, acted, and directed. However, the true testament to this film is the authentic nature of the characters and settings. This is a modern day, genuine west Texas outlaw drama. You can't help liking both the protagonists and antagonists. The last time I found myself rooting this much for the characters on both sides of the law was The Fugative with Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. Well made, well done, and two hours well spent.BTW... I'm a movie buff and this is my first review."
" Superb score by Nick Cave
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,7,Hell or high water. Modern day western about two brothers who need to rob banks in order to keep the family heirloom. Jeff Bridges plays the Tommy Lee Jones character from no country for old men (better than TLJ). Superb score by Nick Cave. Excellent acting. Very atmospheric. A little far fetched. A very enjoyable 7 and a half out of ten.

",2018-10-15 00:00:00,8,"I'm always skeptical when I see a load of 8, 9, or 10/10 reviews, followed by several 2 or 3 star ones - is this a truly awful movie shilled by production staff, or a little gem, misunderstood by the few?Happily, Hell or High Water is one of those rare films that falls into the latter category, I'm not going to spoil it with any details, I'm simply going to recommend it if you enjoy that rare thing today, a genuinely good movie."
" A Sharply Observed Outsider Heist Western
",2018-10-10 00:00:00,9,"Taylor Sheridan is one of the most fascinating screenwriters working in contemporary Hollywood, and until SICARIO 2: SOLDADO he had pretty much scripted a trio of very good thrillers that touched on the sharp end of the US political embrace of neo-liberalism. David Mackenzie followed Denis Villeneuve in working closely with Sheridan (who has a small cameo in the film as a disconsolate cowboy), crafting the kind of film that supposedly doesn't getting made in Hollywood any longer: mature, gritty, character-driven and political. Built around three performances that all have deliberate differences in pacing, Mackenzie's considerable technical ability gives Bridges, Foster and Pine the perfect platform to deliver superb character work. What really stands out though, is the way in which the film gives over running time to perfect little portraits of disenfranchised America, from the waitresses who will not give up their tips, nor tolerate dissent from the menu, through to the bank clerk who just wants to get on with their day, this is a film saturated in local knowledge and a strong sense of place. All the more commendable when it is considered that Mackenzie and Sheridan aren't Texans. This is probably Chris Pine's transitional performance, as he shifts from more mainstream pretty boy roles to grittier character work. It is also Bridges best performance in at least a decade, as he gets caught up in just one last chase before retirement. Ben Foster continues to deliver incredible work on the periphery of Hollywood and must now be considered one of the most underrated actors of his generation. This is a film that baldly directs an attack at the greedy neo-liberal capitalism that propels the US relentlessly onwards, and it must go down as the most sustained and strident critique of the banking crisis and its fall-out. It is also a fine heist western, in the mould of BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, or THUNDERBOLT AND LIGHTFOOT."

Good acting two brothers rob banks to pay off Ranch before it goes into foreclosure. My only real gripe would be a small plot hole if the ranch can generate so much money what can't they use that to pay it off; I feel like that was never really explained. However, still a really enjoyable movie"

Jeff Bridges mumbles through the movie and does his typical Brando imitation. Assorted peculiar characters and psychopaths come in and out of the movie and again, it is nothing new. Enjoyable and entertaining; yes. A classic film? Far from it."

",2018-09-10 00:00:00,8,"And also what to find? How to deal with the past? And not just the past that is building up in the movie. But the past way beyond the start of the movie. There is quite some character work and there is quite some good acting overall. There is action and it starts off quite unual (maybe), with a sort of quiet scene, that turns violent quickly.But it is there and the performances show it. We have literal brothers and brothers in arms sort of. There is a bond, even when it is not shown all the time. It's really well done, something that I was expecting, the pacing is good, although I expect some may feel it moving too slow. Just be aware of what it is you are watching. Then enjoy this really good movie, with an amazing ending, that frankly couldn't be better ..."
" Palpable and pacy, with pitch-perfect characters.
",2018-07-11 00:00:00,8,"While 'Hell Or High Water (2016)' has a few overwrought and oddly expositional moments, it's an excellent heist thriller that uses its palpable sense of place and brilliantly well-realised characters to totally compound you within its incredibly realistic and wonderfully tactile world. It immerses you in the dusty planes of a 'Neo-Western' New Mexico with confidence and ease. There's a lot to unpack thematically, from the phenomenal mirror-image brother relationships to the thinly veiled political message, and most moments, even the exciting and genuinely tense 'action' sequences, are conveyed with a subtlety that makes for a much quieter, more character-driven affair than usual. It has proper stakes and emotionally affecting moments of all kinds, and it certainly leaves a lasting impression. 8/10"
" A Tale of Cops N' Robbers at its Finest
",2018-06-07 00:00:00,9,"The first time I watched this, I turned it off at about the 5-minute mark. I thought it was another dumb movie about inept country-bumpkins, which would rely on a mixture of slapstick and overly-done sappy and violent scenes in order to create enough of a pull to keep at least some audience members somewhat entertained.How wrong I was. I finally sat down and watched it with friends who insisted it was not what it appeared to be within the first few minutes of the film. Without giving too much away, and having to use a spoiler tag, Hell or High Water is a story about two brothers who after the death of their mother, organize a series of (justified?) bank robberies. What ensues is a catch-me-if-you-can scenario with the pursuing ""law"" hell-bent on catching them, and them hell-bent on not being caught. In short, it is a typical story of cops and robbers (or so you would think), with an atypical, uncommon and unconventional narrative. Given the plot, the remote setting and the almost nostalgic atmosphere and ambiance of the film, it is honestly a miracle, and more than a pleasant surprise, just how very gratifying and outstanding this film actually is.A definite must-watch."
" Authentic
",2018-06-02 00:00:00,9,"As someone who was born and raised in Texas, I can attest to how this film accurately portrays the locality and its residents. It's fun to see what you're familiar with up on the big screen.I'm finding that words are escaping me at the moment but this film was at times funny, gritty and REAL. This movie has none of that over-the-top blockbuster feeling. It's like Thelma & Louise (a genuinely underrated film) only with two male leads instead.9/10 would recommend to anyone who enjoys a compelling but not too deep action film."
" Well made
",2018-05-12 00:00:00,7,"In rural Texas, two brothers (Chris Pine and Ben Foster) who have had difficult lives are robbing small banks to save the family farm. Two rangers (Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham) are assigned to solve the series of crimes.In some ways, ""Hell or High Water"" resembles ""Bonnie and Clyde"". Once we know the plight of the robbers, we viewers end up sympathizing with them despite their occasional brutality.The film has a good chase scene in the second half though compared to other past crime capers (of which there are many), the action is more steady than exciting. This is not necessarily a bad thing. The movie's strength is mainly in the dialogues: those between the two brothers and those between the two rangers.The Bridges character is near retirement. He is smart and likeable in some ways but acts like a dumb ass when he makes racial taunts to his long-time colleague whose heritage is half Native American and half Mexican. Birmingham's reactions to the ""teasing"" tells a lot in subtle ways; there is offense mixed with a history of accepting the rudeness. Despite this tension, it is clear the long-time colleagues respect each other.There is an underlying theme that represents our modern times: that many people, like the robber brothers, are living in hard financial times and it is the banks who are regarded as the true villains. It's rather courageous and rare for a modern film to challenge the status quo this way. Add to this the bonus of a cameo appearance by Margaret Bowman as a waitress in a small town dive - someone who seems to have been born in a swamp."
" Gripping, but Lacks Purpose
",2018-05-07 00:00:00,7,"""Hell or High Water"" provides drama and heightened suspense to create a gritty story, but there are some issues in what is being told. Due to strong acting performances, however, these issues can be overlooked for the most part.-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: The premise of the story is interesting and has potential, but there are some issues with realism. Because it is a film, one must make room to suspend disbelief. With that being said, it can only go so far. If there were as many bank robberies in a local area in real life as there were in the film, law enforcement would be putting in a lot more effort to bring it to an end. So the basis for the film is a bit far-fetched. But if one looks beyond this hurdle, then the film is effective in drawing in the viewer. The idea of a strong brotherly love at the center of the story is brilliant; it forces us to have sympathy for the two of them. We can identify with family pretty easily. David Mackenzie does a fine job shaping the story and getting the most out of his actors. He seems to be a natural at creating tension and forcing the audience to latch onto characters. *Cinematography/Editing: The color palette is one of the strengths of this film. The warm yellow and tan tones create a sense of heat and intensity. There are a few missteps with breaking the 180 degree rule, but overall the use of the camera made this film feel authentic and it gave power to the actors. Giles Nuttgens does not try to do too much with the camera. He is comfortable with letting the actors lead the story, rather than trying to get too fancy. The simple work with the camera allowed for the story to take hold of the viewer. In terms of editing, the film is most powerful during the moments it needed to be. It did not draw attention to itself during dialogue or dramatic scenes. However, during ""in-between"" times it seemed a bit jumpy and less than professional. There are some cuts that close in or change angles from a previous shot, but they are too similar to the previous shot and end up being more of a distraction than a directing of the viewer's eye. *Dialogue/Acting: The dialogue feels natural and down to earth. It never tries to be too fancy. Less is more and the scriptwriter understood that for this film, what wasn't said sometimes had more power than what could have been said. The acting was strong all throughout. Jeff Bridges doesn't overact. He stays grounded and it works to his advantage. Ben Foster and Chris Pine also carry their own weight. *Music/Sound Design: The music is minimal yet important. There are some unsettling queues that further heighten the suspense during certain scenes. Some country songs chosen for the film help to set us in the environment of Texas. The sound design is crisp and furthers the film's realistic quality. *Production Design/Special Effects: The sets and costumes are believable and do not draw attention to themselves. The focus of the film is on the story itself and how it affects the characters, so there is no unnecessary wardrobe choices that pop on screen. Texas is painted as bleak throughout the story, and the sets/locations/costumes reflect that. The special effects are nothing out of the ordinary. They are believable and add to the film's gritty feel.*Conclusion: ""Hell or High Water"" tells a unique story. It does so as simply as possible, and this works well because it causes us to focus on the characters rather than on the flashy filmmaking. The strength of the film is in the actors, and that is where our attention is drawn to. This film doesn't try harder than it has to, and for that it is a job well done."
" Captured the real Texas to the T
",2018-05-03 00:00:00,10,"I am writing this review two days after visiting Texas. Let me tell you right now, this movie has not only captured the look and feel of Texas, but the people of Texas. Every character in this movie,{including the T-Bone Café waitress} I feel like I met while visiting there. This movie captured the heart and soul of Texas. Hell or High Water is extremely dynamic in the character study of each and every person in this film. My favorite is Ben Foster's character 'Tanner Howard', everyone else in this film is the resin, this guy is the catalyst that truly makes this one solid movie. At first glance Tanner seems shallow and foolish, as the movie progresses you see that he is the only one that truly grasps the reality and the consequences of their actions, but he does it anyway because of his loyalty and love for his brother. I love the seen in the Casino where Tanner and the large Comanche Indian go nose to nose, it is the second reference to the white man becoming like the American Indian and being stripped of land and dignity. It's as if Tanner has become a Comanche warrior on his last stand before becoming extinct in the world of the evil rich. This is a movie that really should be watched more than once so you can catch every line that is incredibly scripted. Well, I gave this movie a 10 because I loved it, every aspect of it, even the music."
" Average heist movie. Slow tempo. No jokes. Takes itself too seriously but doesnt deliver the goods. Wannabe classic.
",2018-04-22 00:00:00,6,"""Hell or High Water"" has got a revenge theme suitable for these days, where banks keep the hard working class poor. Now the poor start robbing the banks to provide a financial future for their kids. Sort of a modern Robin Hood version, if you were to look at it in perspective. Robin Hood stories have been made before and better and with more humor. Probably Jeff Bridges is supposed to be the dude that provides the fun part, but he overdoes it. Can't take him too seriously as a character. I hate that when actors act too much like a stereotype. This movie could have been better. Now it is average to reasonably good. Not great, but certainly not bad either. That could be my whole review. Had it been the Coen Brothers then EVERYTHING from soundtrack to photography to acting would have been excellent. Had it been the Coen Brothers. Watch ""No Country for Old Men"" instead of this flick, you will be in for a real treat. But it aint the Coen Brothers who made this flick, it's director MacKenzie. Who's that you might ask? I wonder too. Thanks to MacKenzie I have watched just an average heist movie, which had much more going for it. Still it was satisfying to watch. But it nags a little, that it could have been much better and in the end I feel a little empty. Is that all? That's the problem with films that take themselves too seriously. You gotta deliver when you aim for something great and classic. They didnt deliver...It is a wannabe classic. Nothing is more frustrating than second place when you aim for first."
" Shaky grasp on the fundamentals
",2018-02-10 00:00:00,2,"When a film that is loudly and ostentatiously set in Cowboy Texas is actually filmed in neighboring New Mexico you know the director has a shaky grasp on his materials.
When I saw Hell Or High Water in the theater I thought it was about two alcoholic idiots who sit on porches drinking beer before going out and committing violent acts. Seeing it recently on cable tv I realized it's actually about THREE alcoholic idiots who sit on porches drinking beer before going out and committing violent acts. Pine and Foster sling credible Southern accents, which is astonishing in a Hollywood film. Jeff Bridges merely regurgitates the accent and attitude of his last two movies, Crazy Heart and True Grit. (It was wearing thin in True Grit.) There are a number of good, funny, evocative lines in the film, most of them spoken by passers-by. The final scene is, however, a standout. It comes about an hour and thirty-nine minutes into a movie that runs an hour and forty-two minutes. The soundtrack is a good one. Watch the trailer, buy the soundtrack is my advice."
" Some good moments but just a shootemup.
",2018-02-03 00:00:00,4,"This movie dragged on for me. It was just a bit above a total grade B movie but definitely NOT worth my time.
Credibility stretching reality bothered me. I especially disliked the Texas oriented gun culture. At one robbery one gun packing guy on the floor sneaks it out to try to be a hero. It ends badly for him as it does for the guard. Immediately after that the ruckus attracts about a dozen gun packing 2Nd Amendment hero wannabes that come ""heroically"" blazing guns afire after the 2 bad guys. In spite of riddling their pickup truck with dozens of penetrating rounds they receive only ONE flesh wound!
Then in a follow on fire fight the dozen ""heroes"" are assaulted by the bad guy with an automatic weapon rapidly firing about 4 FULL cases of ammo at reasonably close range missing everyone.
REALLY???? 
Well it adds excitement for sure. But it moves the movie down to the level of a cheap guy flick with action.The 2nd Amendment Texans of course will feel vindicated other than the fact that had no gun been pulled, no one would have been injured in the robbery, much less killed. The implied harmless ness of major gunfire in this movie is disturbingly unreal and is the final ""shot"" that makes is a cheap thriller."
" Builds into something memorable
",2017-12-30 00:00:00,7,"On the face of it this is a standard cops-and-robbers bank heist tale, with a chalk/cheese pair of protagonists and a cliche edge-of-retirement lawman to give chase.The script here though is sharper than your average. Jeff Bridges (on form) as the lawman, pulls out zingers a-plenty and there's generally plenty of black humour to go around. A deft melding of the ol' Slow West (gun) stock with a modern layering of dead-end ghost towns and bank foreclosures: the huge Texan landscapes & skies, both entirely empty, the camera snaps up whenever the opportunity arises, the moody score (when not dipping into Country-Rock) and dialogue all contributing to the very definite feel of a moody mourning, like something in this world is lost or broken.Old fashioned American film-making, albeit from a Scottish director, I found this is a little lethargic to get going but by the end I was completely sold."
" I'm simply shocked !!!
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,1,"I simply cannot understand how this movie got nominated for Best Picture Oscar !!! I got bored in the first 20 minutes like never before !!!!
The fact that its screenplay got also nominated for Oscar simply gives me ghoosebumps ! This only confirms me that academy awards (doesn't worth capitalising anymore) it's only politically and financially infuenced ! SPOILER ALERT !!!Can someone explain me how the little brother didn't end up arrested in the end of the movie ?? With dozens of witnesses, and even him identified by policemen after splitting cars ?!
Simply unreal !!! I could rewrite this movie screenplay while going to toilet in a single morning and improve it !And what really scares me the most are other users ratings and its rating on IMDB. But I guess this is what 21st century is all about: LYING, LYING and keep LYING all the time, on TV, in media, in movies, on blogs.... LIE as much as you can :)"
" The perfect movie for 2016
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,8,"The film's first shot features graffiti that reads ""3 tours in Iraq but no bailout for people like us."" This may be a summer 2016 movie, but it is Trump's America...a heist story for those who feel screwed over. Which is everybody. And while the story is hardly original, the dialogue is tight and fresh. From the bank robbers to the eye witnesses to the law enforcement to the native peoples, everybody senses that they were left out. And everybody has a quip that captures it. The morality - and chaos - that is left behind may not be new, but it is well crafted. Bridges and Pine are electric, and every minute is riveting."
" I b'leave he's up yonder....
",2017-11-25 00:00:00,8,"Two rambunctious young fellows decide to rob the Midlands Bank of Texas that's threatening to foreclose on their pitiful and unproductive little cattle ranch. One of the boys (Chris Pine) is notably less rambunctious than his older brother (Ben Foster), who has just left the slams after a six-year vacation there. Foster is thrilled with the banditry, whoops with delight as they zigzag away from the banks, leaving a cloud of dust. Pine loves his brother but believes him to be a little nuts. Pine has spent the last year or so caring at home for their dying mother. ""This the bed she was in?"" asks Foster, on seeing the empty bed for the first time. ""Well, Eff it. She didn't care much for me anyhow."" (A pragmatist.) As the two reckless boys set about their task, usually planned, but one entirely spontaneous, we meet the other side of the law -- Jeff Bridges as a casual old Texas Ranger on the brink of retirement, and his Comanche deputy and sidekick, Gil Birmingham, whom Bridges is always teasing about his Indianness -- catching the robbers with voodoo, eating pemmican, and the like.In contrast to the robbers, Bridges kind of slouches around, takes his time to think things over, and exercises his fulgurating intuition to anticipate their next move.I don't want to get into the plot in any more detail. It's a good movie. It rings true. The location shooting in New Mexico is evocative. The characters -- even the most minor -- are colorful. The story itself is credible, with moments comedy alternating with those carrying the tension of a coiled spring. It certainly seems right as a picture of small-town Texas. It owes a lot, I suspect, to the wildly successful ""Fargo"" that preceded it by a few years but I don't care. If all imitations were this good I'd start drinking almond flavored soy milk instead of the real thing."
" Classic Modern Western
",2017-11-22 00:00:00,9,"I doubt I will ever get tired of watching this film. Like many classic westerns it is written so well with just enough words for the actors to work their craft, it seems effortless as the story unfolds. Years from now I shall play the DVD and still enjoy it. Chris Pine and Ben Foster have quickly become indicators that a movie is worth paying to go see. Both have an excellent body of work in different genres. Beau Bridges has been so for quite a while now. All the bit parts are well played so that this movie has nothing in the way of weak links or flat spots. Gotta love the grumpy old waitress. And Ben Foster is absolutely the right age if anyone is planning a movie about Custer. Aside from being a western Hell Or High Water plays nicely alongside 99 Homes, Money Monster and Killing Them Softly. All these films are concerned with Americas economic problems and peoples feelings of despair and abandonment. Crime is usually the solution closest to hand. The movie drives through run down Texas towns with scenes of failed businesses, while Foster and Pine crack wise in the style we liked so much in the first Magnificent Seven film. Think of Brad Dexter and Steve MacQueen. The soundtrack follows the images beautifully, the tone of Hell Or High Water is pitch perfect and I haven't met anyone yet with a bad word to say about it."
" Really Solid Attempt at What It Set Out to Be
",2017-11-13 00:00:00,8,"A by-the-books bank robbing flick that could best be described as No Country for Old Men-adjacent for several reasons, one being Jeff Bridges (who, at his age, is doing his best to corner the market on ornery, hardheaded, no-nonsense old men that groan all of their lines) who plays a character cut from the exact same cloth as Tommy Lee Jones's was. It's what you'd expect a movie about two brothers in Texas robbing banks would be. But it's not trying to change conventions, instead focusing on being a ""really good one of those,"" with solid work on both sides of the camera."
" A very basic story stretched razor thin over 90 minutes, and dependent on the actors to carry it
",2017-11-08 00:00:00,5,"Meh. Very weirdly convoluted and stretched out way of conveying what ended up being an extremely simplistic and actually quite boring story. Characters and acting were okay enough to be worth watching if you're otherwise bored, but if you miss the entire plot, you haven't missed much. If you're sensitive to offhand racial digs, don't bother."
" Well made and acted neo-western lacks emotional impact
",2017-10-22 00:00:00,6,"David Mackenzie's neo-western is a eulogy on the death of the American west and the last of the cowboys. There is a wistful mood and a mournful tone, with a sense of loss at the heart of the piece, and in many ways the film is all about loss - the loss of family, the loss of time, the loss of money, the loss of dignity. It's a remarkably understated crime thriller that uses the architecture of the old cat-and-mouse chase formula to sketch a surprisingly realistic picture of criminality and desperation.A lot of this film's success can be credited to both Taylor Sheridan's lean but muscular screenplay and the wonderful cast of character actors performing his matter-of-fact dialogue. Chris Pine escapes the bland movie star folly of his career thus far and completely disappears under the skin of a wounded farmboy-turned- man-of-the-house, providing the pathos and heart to the story, while on screen brother Ben Foster's fraught energy provides the conflict and volatility. And then there is the ever dependable Jeff Bridges who mumbles and grumbles his way through a performance that feels completely authentic and effortless as he doggedly pursues the brothers while looking every inch the aged cowboy. It's a shame then that his character wasn't given more meat to his bones because, regardless of Bridges' low-key brilliance, the cop-in-pursuit subplot is where the movie is fundamentally lacking. At no point do our sympathies diverge away from the outlaw brothers to the Sheriff, unlike in Michael Mann's 'Heat' where both cop and robber were portrayed in equally sympathetic and interesting ways. Therefore, there is very little conflict within us come the inevitable showdown(s) between them and that robs us of experiencing the full breath of dramatic tension and emotional impact in the third act.There is still much to like in this film, even with a somewhat insubstantial subplot. To think that a simple story about cops and robbers can still work so well in these post-modern audience aware times is actually a testament to its level of craft and execution. I thought everything about the sub-genre had been pretty much exhausted, but 'Hell or High Water' proves, much like Bridges' grizzled performance, that there is life left in this old dog yet."
" good performances can't save critical plot flaws
",2017-10-07 00:00:00,5,"I'm torn on this film; it has many good points including first rate performances from Jeff Bridges and some of the supporting actors. The music is terrific and the cinematography is gorgeous -- though I was disappointed to find out it was all filmed in NEW Mexico (us Easterners were probably easily fooled -- but don't Texans and New Mexicans sense this right off? Perhaps the crew -- 90% British -- don't see any differences between those two states!)It's also very funny in places. But HOHW has a fatal flaw, and that is....plot holes the size of Jupiter.The biggest and most glaring: EVERYTHING in the film hinges on the two bank robbing brother's motivation to save the family farm from foreclosure, by robbing one local bank chain of the petty cash in the drawer (and then laundering that money at casinos, and ultimately, paying their late mother's reverse mortgage off with the stolen cash).I am gobsmacked the film's writers did not bother to research this AT ALL. That is not how reverse mortgages even work. You do not even have to make payments on a reverse mortgage, so it could not be ""in arrears"". And the mother borrowed only $25,000? That's chump change -- the ranch is clearly hundreds of acres (we see it at the end, stretching to the horizon) and worth at the rock-bottom minimum hundreds of thousands of dollars BEFORE THEY FIND OIL ON IT. So the brothers were never ""poor"" as Chris Pine alleges at the end, when claiming that's why he robbed banks -- so his two sons would not ""grow up poor like he did"". OK -- except he wasn't poor. And most people provide for their sons by GETTING A JOB. And maybe, moving somewhere where there are more jobs. Or by SELLING the land (so you could pay off the reverse mortgage legally) and then still having anywhere from several hundred thousand dollars to MILLIONS OF DOLLARS (!!!).On top of this, it is infuriating to think the filmmakers think if you cannot provide your children with MILLIONS OF DOLLARS...they are ""poor"". There is in their eyes nothing in between foreclosure/welfare and MILLIONS? Nothing like, say, ""an ordinary job"" and ""paying your bills"" and ""living an honest life""?It's like some weird justification for armed robbery, to ""get even"" with banks -- who are apparently supposed to forgive all loans, and never demand repayment, and of course, we all know if you own property -- it is ""yours"" for all eternity, even if you don't pay your taxes, bills or mortgage loans.On top of this; HOW can people who KNOW they have just won the biggest life lotto of all -- owning a ranch pumping $600,000 worth of oil profits every year and ergo, worth at least $20 million -- be whining about ""how poor they are"" and ""how rough they have it"" and how they have to be criminals??? That defies all credulity. Most people in their shoes would be on spending sprees with the royalty checks.Some other posters have also noted other stupid stuff like ""casinos have cameras"" and ""since they are already suspect (definitely the Ben Foster character, as he's been shot by police), it would be easy to work backwards, and realize Chris Pine paid off the mortgage on his ranch in a suspicious fashion, and with checks from a casino"". The most mundane detective work would have turned up the casino laundering trick and bingo, case solved.Lastly: at the end, Chris Pine is GUT SHOT, and has a bullet in him, but it hardly effects him -- he's not rolling on the ground screaming in pain or dying from peritonitis -- and how did he get the bullet out? going to the hospital would have pointed a big fat arrow at him as part of the robbery team. Did he dig it out himself and do home surgery? WTF?Too bad that nobody edited this or read it before filming, or had a bank loan officers give it a once over -- the devil is in the details, and these flaws keep this from being anything more than a mediocre shoot 'em up robbery film (with debts, also noted by others, to ""No Country For Old Men"")."
" Hell or High Water
",2017-09-28 00:00:00,1,A very uninteresting story. Its very slow and probably the worst movie I have ever seen. This is about two brothers robbing banks...The direction is poor and so is the acting.

",2017-09-21 00:00:00,6,"While this movie held my attention and had *excellent* cinematography, the rest of it fell flat. It's hard to call this a 'character study' when all the characters are essentially the same the entire movie. It's SO slow moving, with sparse and plain dialog with an ending that's more of a 'huh'?? This could have been so much better expanding on any of the backstory or truly making any of these characters real, but I didn't get much out of it. I continue to call BS on many movies nominated for an academy award these days. I wouldn't call this a Western Either. Just the main pairs of characters having similar dialog and otherwise just hanging out together. In short, I was expecting a lot more."
" Extremely high in quality, nothing hellish at all about it
",2017-09-12 00:00:00,10,"One of the most critically acclaimed films of 2016 and nominated for four Oscars, 'Hell or High Water' also had an intriguing idea, a talented cast with Jeff Bridges being a particular attraction and a script by ace writer Taylor Sheridan (writer for the brilliant 'Sicario', and went on to direct one of the most promising directorial debuts of 2017 with the recent 'Wind River').'High or High Water' was not a let down in any way. One of the finest films of 2016 and to me all its four Oscar nominations were among the year's most deserving (Bridges' nomination for Best Supporting Actor should have been a strong contender for winning). It is not the most original of stories sure, but that did not matter at all because it executed all its components impeccably and still had its share of surprises. It does have a slow start somewhat but not in any way a want-to-switch-it-off way.Along with 'La La Land' (it has become popular to hate that film, loved it personally), 'Hell or High Water' was one of the year's best-looking films. It has a rustic Western look in terms of setting that is very effectively evoked and it is stunningly shot. It should have been a contender for Best Cinematography, but at least got some recognition for the concise editing.The rip-roaring, at times hauntingly elegiac and at other times rousing, soundtrack enhances everything going on on screen. That one of the best scores that year was not even nominated and the pretty awful score for 'Jackie' (one of the worst things about a disappointing film) was even to a very subjective reviewer, who absolutely despises the ""I don't understand..."" and all its various other just as clichéd, overused and abused variations, is not easy to fathom.Best Original Screenplay was very much deserving, with Sheridan once again striking gold with a snappy, smart and tightly structured script. While meditative in pacing, the story is nonetheless absorbing and surprisingly rich in its complexity. It's also intricately told and with a mix of the hard-edged and the elegiac.David Mackenzie does a remarkable job directing, getting the most out of the story and atmosphere and bringing out the best of his cast. Chris Pine's lead performance is one of his best, but it's the supporting cast that shine more.Ben Foster, in a role that is the polar opposite to Pine's and perhaps the slightly more interesting, is a revelation, even more is an astounding Jeff Bridges who completely disappears into his role to unforgettable effect. One must also single out Gil Birmingham, who really wrenched the heart in this year's 'Wind River' and gives a different but every bit as wonderful turn here.In conclusion, wonderful film and a 2016 highlight. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

",2017-09-03 00:00:00,5,"Tanner (Ben Foster) gets out of prison, serving time for robbing banks. He teams up with his straight brother Toby (Chris Pine) for a series of bank robberies to pay off various liens against the ranch owned by their recently deceased mother. They wash the money at an Oklahoma casino. Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) plays a sheriff nearing retirement who is after them. Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham) is his ""half-breed"" partner one of the many inappropriate slurs used in the film.Chris Pine was rather plain and subdued during the film, just being dutiful to a family that prefers to live without him. Jeff Bridges was a bore. Ben Foster was the only real animated character. He was reckless.The acting was okay. The dialogue a bit dry, except when then were bad mouthing Native Americans and Mexicans and even then it wasn't impressive. I imagine the film's popularity is due to the populist appeal of banks being inherently evil, and the common man can get back at them...this and the bank robbery scene where everyone in the bank has a gun.Guide: F-word. Sex. Blurred nudity. Disparaging language. Being a fan of Illuminati bankers, I didn't like it as much as my fellow reviewers."

",2017-08-29 00:00:00,9,"I didn't get to see this movie in the theaters and couldn't wait until I could watch it on streaming or DVD. I had heard so many good things about it, and sometimes when that happens I get a bit of a letdown when it turns out not to be as good as the hype. This was definitely not the case with this one. The movie is a wonderful and exciting viewing experience. The highlights of my enjoyment were the performances by Chris Pine and Jeff Bridges, the wonderful score and soundtrack, and the beautiful cinematography. Everything came together great in this wonderful modern day western. A must see."

",2017-08-26 00:00:00,8,"If Hell On High Water does nothing else you will throw stones or whatever else is handy at the television the next time you see Tom Selleck or Henry Winkler or any of those other folksy actors from back in the day hawk the virtues of the reverse mortgage. It should be called the reverts mortgage because it reverts to your heirs upon your demise. I can certainly sympathize with the Howard brothers here. When my mother passed away and left my brother and I with the bought and paid for completely debt free family home we both salvaged a considerable estate. Not like Chris Pine and Ben Foster have. Their little patch of land with the house on it is owed to the Texas Midland Bank and they have to cough up the full amount or be kicked off. Pine with wife and family there the situation is a crisis. Fortunately Foster is an experienced criminal who has an expertise in robbing banks. Even with some mistakes these two get away with a lot.That includes fooling the Texas Rangers on their case who are Jeff Bridges who is days from retirement and Gil Birmingham a full blooded Comanche Indian. They have an interesting relationship and Bridges isn't exactly the most politically correct person out there.Hell On High Water got a nomination for Best Picture in 2016 and Bridges was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. Let's just say goals are accomplished, not without loss on both sides. The brothers Pine and Foster have a nice tandem chemistry the same as Bridges and Birmingham.The film this seems to best compare to is Clint Eastwood's classic A Perfect World. Watch and see if you agree."
" Bulk sale on cowboy hats!
",2017-08-25 00:00:00,6,"I noticed that the majority of the characters in this movie wore the same exact hats. While some didn't wear hats, those that did wear cowboy hats were very distinct, white with a dark band around it, the same grooves, and most distinctly, three holes on either side. There must've been a sale on dumb ass cowboy hats for a bulk price. By the way the movie was pretty good but not fabulous."
" A Modern Western That Makes You Think
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,9,"As a Brit who's spent quite a bit of time in Texas over the past few years, I enjoyed this modern take on the Western. The oil price downturn has been devastating for many people who live in Texas, especially in the aftermath of the Financial Crisis and the subprime shenanigans in the US housing sector. So, this film has something to say about that, which I could relate to.There was a road trip aspect to the movie, which I also liked. This reminded me of my own journeys along the Texan highways, and although I've never been west of Austin in a car, I really appreciated some of the scenery shown here.The characters are all strong. Many people here mention the great jobs done by Ben Foster, Chris Pine and, of course, the always-watchable Jeff Bridges. However, fair credit must also be given to Gil Birmingham, who played Bridges' put-upon partner. I had downloaded this movie on Amazon Prime as something to watch on the train but I wished I'd seen it first in the cinema. The Western does seem to be making a comeback and if they can't be laugh-a-minute (e.g. The Hateful Eight) then they need to be intelligent and observant, like this one! I think it has something to say about the consequences of violence as well, although the writers are smart enough to leave things hanging so that you have to draw your own conclusions about the rights and wrongs of what the characters did.But very nice effort!"
" Brotherly Love
",2017-08-15 00:00:00,10,"I have watched this movie over 90 times, and I can see it another 90 times. Why ? Because it cleverly shows a ""Brothers Love"" and a fathers love and the length he will go for them. I guess that makes me have to surrender my man card. I would do this same thing for my brothers if they were still living, and or my children, That is why this movie is special. If you have not watched this movie yet, You Must, as it is specially surprising. I am from Ohio by birth, but my heart beats for Texas ""GOOD, BAD, or INDIFFERENT""."
" Every cliché in the book
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,1,"If I'd seen this movie before Trump got elected, I might have given it a 2 rating instead of a 1. I don't care about West Texas and I certainly don't want to try to ""understand"" its citizens. The best thing about the movie is Jeff Bridge. Otherwise, it's just awful. West Texas, bigoted, gun toting ignoraamuses, the ugliest scenery I've ever had to endure, cattle herding, stereotypical ""men"" who make wise cracks to each other to form bonds, lonely waitresses,stupid bank robbers, and a plot you could drive a truck through. An example: the bank robbers steal the money from a bank at 8:30 in the morning. (This is in the first scene, so it's not a spoiler). They drive away. A cop car goes by in answer to an alarm at the bank. There are NO other cars on the road. The police don't stop the car to search it. If the police in this town are that dumb, they deserve the bank robbers they've got. The dialogue is flat and almost unintelligible, the characters are predictable, the plot is weak."

",2017-08-12 00:00:00,4,"You just cannot understand the garbled speech of the two Texas Rangers in hot pursuit of two brothers who go around robbing banks so that they can use the loot to pay off a farm mortgage. Ironically, they're robbing from the banks that control the mortgage.One brother has just been released from prison and the other is paying off alimony to an embittered wife and they have two rather estranged children from their father.The ending is quite awkward. The two guys run off from each bank in the fashion of ""Bonnie & Clyde."" We're really dealing with two losers here who have left life pass them by."
" Rating: A+
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,10,"One of the best movies of 2016, without a single doubt! Remember when I said that The Magnificent Seven was the Western that we needed? Well, Hell or High Water just surpassed it.This is an amazing piece of art, with characters full-developed at the smallest detail. David Mackenzie takes his time to not only introduce us the characters, but he makes them THE film. There is an absurd level of personality development with scenes that are so simple and subtle, but that manage to captivate us through a brilliant script.Chris Pine and Ben Foster have probably their best performances ever, as well as an Oscar-worthy performance from Jeff Bridges. I mean, how great can they be? I love the duo chemistry, I cared about them so much and that put me at the edge of my seat at the end of the film, when all the action unfolds. Also, Gil Birmingham (Alberto Parker) played brilliantly Marcus' partner. The constant bickering between each other is funny and compelling.I'm surprised with the quality of the direction by Mackenzie. I didn't know him until now, so I'm blown away by the outstanding achievement in what he did. Great cinematography, amazing long takes with a perfect soundtrack accompanying this thrilling Western. As for flaws, I can't really pinpoint any ... The pacing is deliberately slow, so that might not please some people, but the truth is that, if the pacing isn't as controlled as this one was, the characters can't be as captivating and the connection between them and the audience falls apart.Hell or High Water is by far the best Western of 2016! Pine, Foster and Jeff Bridges have Oscar-worthy performances (especially the latter) in a film with a brilliant direction by David Mackenzie. Cinematography, soundtrack, script, suspense, characters, story ... This movie achieves everything that it wanted to achieve with every parameter at the very top of quality. A Western masterpiece.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"
" An instant classic of the genre.
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,9,"A tight, tense movie that works well as an action thriller, but that provides a lot more depth and emotion than most other movies in the genre. The movie is built on great performances (and writing) for its four main characters. it's impossible to single out one as above the others; all four actors deliver performances that are very honest and real, while being just larger-than-life enough to be entertaining and memorable without becoming silly. The script is wonderful; I love how it opens in media res and how it naturally fills in details through dialog without becoming pedantic. Cinematography and music are both very well done. This is the kind of movie that will become a replayable classic: accessible and propulsive, filled with one great scene after another, and with quality work from everyone involved."
" Jeff Bridges Scores Another Classic
",2017-07-21 00:00:00,9,"Jeff Bridges plays a crusty old Texas Ranger in his sunset years in ""Asylum"" director David Mackenzie's ""Hell or High Water,"" an atmospheric, slow-burn, modern-day western about two bank robbers. Ben Foster and Chris Pine are fine as the desperadoes who rob the banks. They seem pretty savvy, too, because they take their loot and launder it at an Indian casino. They aren't greedy. They take over the loose bills in the teller's drawer and leave the money packets with the ink-packs designed to explode and mark the thieves. Foster is cast as older brother Tanner Howard; Howard shot his father to death and did time in prison, while his younger brother, Toby (Chris Pine of the rebooted ""Star Trek"" franchise), participates in the hold-ups. Tanner is a mean-spirited, troublemaking dastard who has no compunctions about shooting his fellow man. Miraculously enough, these guys follow a strategy that involves robbing on Midland, Texas, Banks, because the bank is poised to take their dead mother's land if they cannot pay back the loan. ""Sicario"" scenarist Taylor Sheridan wrote this cops and robbers outing. Just as villainous Tanner and Toby ridicule each other as brothers will do, Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton and his partner Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham of the ""Twilight"" franchise) exchange barbs. Alberto constantly needles Marcus because he knows his old partner wants to do something useful before he ends up on his pension. Marcus decides to investigate the bank robbers, and this assignment keeps both men on the road. Marcus is a shrewd judge of character and he figures out what the Howard brothers will do next. What could otherwise have boiled down to a cutthroat Texas manhunt turns into a character study on both sides of good and evil. Clocking in at 102 minutes, ""Hell or High Water"" features wide-open, sprawling spaces and towns on the brink of extinction in Texas. The banks are the real bandits, and the Howards manipulate the situation to their advantage. In one scene, Marcus and Alberto enter a steak restaurant right across the street from a bank that Marcus bets will get robbed. The waitress that takes their order is a grumpy old dame (Margaret Bowman of ""No Country for Old Men"") who asks them what they don't want on their order. Everybody, she points out, buys a steak and potato at the restaurant, and they either don't want the green beans or they want the corn on the cob. Bowman is a real hoot and a holler, and her minor role enlivens the action. ""Hell or High Water"" qualifies as a down-t0-earth crime saga with interesting characters. Bridges delivers another wonderful performance that borrows something from his Rooster Cogburn portrayal in ""True Grit."" Incidentally, Bridges received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Similarly, ""Hell Or High Water"" received Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Editing, and Best Original Screenplay. This is one you shouldn't miss"
" Small Potato Robbers
",2017-07-12 00:00:00,8,"(Flash Review)With the risk of losing their deceased mother's farm and land to the bank, where oil was discovered, two brother hold up tiny banks in towns so small they lack traffic lights in order to pay off the mortgage. This film has smart, honest and entertaining dialog that really helps move the story along. Great acting all around complimented by cinematography that accentuates the desolateness of their habitat gives the film a great atmosphere. It has many similarities to No Country For Old Men and the cat and mouse nature. This is simply a well-told good film; nothing groundbreaking but solid. Jeff Bridges is great."
" Much atmosphere, little substance
",2017-07-04 00:00:00,5,"In West Texas, two brothers go on a bank-robbing rampage. They are targeting the branches of one bank in particular, The Texas Midland Bank. This bank is about to foreclose on the mortgage on their ranch and claim the property, and robbing the bank to pay its own loan seems appropriate. On the trail of the brothers is a Texas Ranger, Marcus Hamilton, with only a few weeks to retirement.Interesting idea, clumsily written and so-so in execution. While the whole idea of robbing a bank to pay off a loan to that bank is wonderfully, wickedly poetic, here it is turned into a ideological, political sermon. So rather than a decent crime drama, the movie gets turned into an attempt to be something bigger, and it fails at that, taking shots at things clearly troublesome to the writer, but not necessarily to anyone else.Add in much fake atmosphere - mournful music, long shots of Texas vistas - just to make the movie seem more profound than it is, and you have case of style over substance. It was as if director David MacKenzie was trying to emulate the Coen Brothers' Fargo, but then didn't have the story to go with the atmosphere.It's not all bad though. Jeff Bridges is great as Marcus Hamilton and there are a few good action scenes and funny moments. I found the proliferation of guns a great, often funny, indictment of American gun culture. Not sure it was meant to be that profound or funny though, as it was probably quite realistic."
" Really Impressed
",2017-07-02 00:00:00,8,"West Texas seems to be a big place for movies lately... Just loved the dialogue, very sharp between Jeff Bridges and his deputy, Alberto. Alberto was great... and especially loved the waitress Jenny Ann (Katy Mixon). Again, kudos to the writer... thinking Elmore would have liked this."
" Talk about de ja vu!
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,7,"I don't know why, but sometimes when I watch a film it reminds me of another film and I just can't shake that feeling for its entire runtime. In this case, 'Hell and High Water' just made me think of 'No Country For Old Men' all the way through. They are both set in the deserts of Texas and are about an outlaw on the run from the law. Okay, so that smallest of synopsis doesn't quite fit if you've seen both films, but it's as near as I can get in such few words. I guess what I'm trying to say is that, in this age of 'shared cinematic universes,' it wouldn't surprise me to see both films somehow existing side by side.Whereas 'No Country For Old Men' had a man on the run with an ill-gotten bag of loot from a hired killer while the law was – kind of – hot on both their trails, 'Hell or High Water' as a pair of brothers robbing banks while Josh Brolin is a sheriff on the brink of retirement and his long-suffering partner looking into the trail of empty cash drawers they've been leaving in their wake. Both films show the contrast between the two sets of characters' journey and from now on I'll do my best to concentrate on 'Hell or High Water' rather than constantly dwelling on how similar it was to 'No Country For Old Men.' The two robbers here are played by Chris 'new Kirk' Pine and Ben Foster (who looks fatter than the last time I saw him on screen!). I guess this casting was deliberate, but Pine is definitely the more sympathetic of the two and we get the feeling he's being led astray by his older, more violent and law-breaking brother. Plus Pine is also afforded the backstory of an ex-wife and child who he owes money to. Then we have the long arms of the law, mainly Brolin, who shines as the gruff and not always politically correct sheriff who is hot on their heels. I would say that him and his partner are probably more enjoyable to watch than the bank robbers as the banter between them and general long suffering vibe is truly a joy to watch.So, it's ultimately a cat and mouse game where you probably can guess that the two couples are going to meet up during the final act and it's all going to end badly for someone. Despite enjoying the film with its lush desert setting and realistic banter between the pairs, I'd say that its predictability would be the one area where it falls down a bit. I was only about a quarter of the way through when I made my prediction as to how it will play out for the four main characters. I won't mention it here as it turned out to be 100% correct, therefore would be giving away one hell of a major spoiler.Despite the bank robbery scenes naturally involving high-tension and speedy getaways, I did feel that the overall pacing of the film was quite slow. To some, that may sound like a negative point, but it's not the kind of story that needs fast-paced shootouts and high-budget actions scenes. It's a character piece as much as it is a cops and robbers film. I did my best to stop mentioning 'No Country For Old Men,' but I have to say that if you enjoyed that, i.e. characters, settings and mood, then you should like this one too. At least no one gets killed by a weird, portable hydraulic air-type pump thing. Weird."
" A morality tale not to be missed
",2017-06-28 00:00:00,9,"This film is absolutely gorgeous to watch while also having fantastic action that is surrounded by fleshed out characters that are played extremely well by a fantastic cast. We never feel comfortable with the violence in the film because it never feels stylish and never becomes commonplace, and that makes the violence that does happen more effective.'Hell or High Water' is perfectly paced. The film begins with a punch & ends on the very same note. I was thoroughly engrossed by the story & how well it progressed. Taylor Sheridan's Screenplay is Sharp. His Writing is tops, allowing us to get into the story & have an interesting experience. David Mackenzie's Direction is expertly done. He's handled the film, with command. Giles Nuttgens' Cinematography is fantastic. West Texas has been captured beautifully. Jake Roberts' Editing is crisp. Art & Costume Design are perfect. ---Yidioo"
" Keeps You in Suspense
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,7,"Beautiful views, quiet small towns, and the brothers actions is like a knife cutting through the air and disturbs the silence. brilliant dialogues of Jeff Bridges, good acting from Ben Foster. The hardships of the people, the towns, you can almost empathize with the reasons that led the brothers with their actions. Could be a robin hood story, but not when innocent people are getting hurt when one of the brothers enjoying the crime too much."
" Gritty bank heist thriller
",2017-06-08 00:00:00,6,"HELL OR HIGH WATER is an appropriately gritty bank heist thriller that manages to breathe some freshness into an overworked genre. The film has a sweaty desert setting and casts Ben Foster and Chris Pine as a pair of brothers cast into a world of crime due to economic difficulties. Pine has the lesser role of the two, basically all square-jawed niceness, while Foster, who has been an interesting presence in Hollywood ever since THE PUNISHER, adds another deranged role to his repertoire.Pitted against these siblings are the local police force, spearheaded by a typically laconic Jeff Bridges. The plot as it plays out is quite predictable, but the direction is far above average and the action sequences almost hum with electricity. The bank heist scenes are as tense as you'd expect, but a HEAT-style shoot-out and car chase are both very well achieved and some climactic moments are also nicely portrayed. It's not a film I'd consider a masterpiece, but it does the job well enough and the realism never drops for a second."
" Surprisingly good movie
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,9,"Very enjoyable movie since the beginning. Reminded me of my time traveling in Utah because of the arid landscapes and the small towns. The critic to the American banking system (well worldwide) while at the same time accepting it as a fact that you better live with was surprising. Also the painting in a wall at the beginning of the movie stating ""they rescued us from Irak to forget us here"" (or something similar) reminded me of those US-citizens not happy with US spending in abroad military interventions.A good movie with a good end where two men with a lot of thing to be angry to each other just accept each other fates. Loved every aspect of it."
" The water level is a little low
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,6,"Part road movie part crime drama, Hell or Highwater is a good portrait of the same corner of America as No Country for Old Men. It has intelligent statements to make about people on the losing side of the relationship between housing and the banks, and there are scenes of well written dialog throughout.And yet the picture as a whole feels strangely underwhelming. The atmosphere is rather bland, with little sense of conflict, tension or human drama and the characters are rather one dimensional. They are merely representations of the themes of the story. Their motives are clear but never feel personalized. Jeff Bridges plays the same weary coming-of-age law man that Tommy Lee Jones depicts in No Country for Old Men, but without the heart or the wisdom.The best scene in the is the last one, where Bridges confronts one of the men that he's been chasing all movie. There is a deeper dramatic undercurrent in their exchange that is missing from the rest of the movie. Without the gripping performances or much in the way of visual style, Hell or High Water is no more memorable than a low budget television movie. This is a case of good premise, weak execution."
" Not the great film it thinks it is
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,6,"Hell or High Water adds another arrow to that old quiver that says if you want to garner some nominations for acting awards, channel your inner Mushmouth. That's not to say, of course, that Jeff Bridges is not a fine actor, nor that it is acceptable in a modern movie to fill it with casual racism.This is an alt-country, slice-of-life, protect-what-you-have- because-the-government-will-not kind of affair. Robbing banks to take care of your family makes you the good guys, if you're white, and until you kill someone. Whatever opportunity the movie creates to have a meaningful discussion about the ownership of capital is surely, sorely lost somewhere in the perfectly plaited folds of Chris Pine's grease-bomb hair.It is perhaps rather unfair to watch Hell or High Water and constantly think of better Texas-noir flicks, like No Country for Old Men or The Counselor. Regardless, there are a handful of well- played moments, especially as the townsfolk chase the brothers en masse, posse comitatus. The Howard brothers are playing a dangerous game, seemingly with nothing to lose, because they would rather die fighting for what they believe in than play the crooked capitalists' game.Then again, the whole movie is based on their desire to preserve their childhood home in order to exploit the oil reserves within, which in turn, when burned, will increase the temperature of the planet and kill us all.Who's the good guy now?"
" One of the Best Modern Westerns I Have Seen
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,9,"I knew too little before seen it and I had a little surprise. I didn't expected the movie to be that good. It tells an actual story. many people it has been trough this kind of things, because in places like this, they're so far away from everyone. Jeff Bridges says it perfectly: ""No one can help them now, they're alone"".It tells the story of two brothers who start robbing banks for getting the money they need to pay the debts they're in with the bank and so the child of one of them, Toby (Chris Pine) can provide a better future for his sons. He is helped by his ex-convict brother Tanner (Ben Foster) who is a bit crazy and has a criminal mind more violent than his brother. They're both being chased by the ranger of the state, the Ranger Marcus, played by a great Jeff Bridges (as always). All the actors in here are great in their roles. They fit perfectly in their roles, from the two brothers desperately looking for money to the old ranger who won't give up in making the law being applied. Even many of the secondary characters like tho woman from the bar or the mate from the ranger are great in their roles, so this a very good point of the movie.One of the few things I have to add against it it's that at parts, at least for me, felt a bit too slow and that all the things they talk with the attorney about their properties and so I feel like they were not explained clearly, but at least at the end we get a bit of explanation in this final dialogue between Marcus & Toby.Other things that is truly remarkable is it's cinematography. It captures the feeling of rush when they're escaping from all the banks, but also captures the feeling of loneliness of this Texas Midlands, all the plains with very few houses and a very long and dusty road.I recommend you this one if you want to get away from the typical image of USA (the people living in all of this big houses with plenty of money and so) and want to discover a new reality in there, and also if you want to see something different from all of this blockbusters full of explosions and non-sense things. A very enjoyable movie!"
" Seen this movie before ?
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,6,"Basically, an updated version of the Jessie and Frank James story done for the umpteenth time. Decent acting but still a well worn plot minus a new or original plot twist or story line. Movies like this fall into the same clichéd progression pretty much all the time. Big bad establishment types (in this case a Bank), good people who are forced to turn bad to survive, and a conflicted lawman figure tasked with upholding the law while trying to maintain some personal honor. Been there...done that....don't want to do it again."
" Until the last Act
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,8,"Honestly, the movie wasn't any better or worse than any road movie with bad guys doing their best to get hunted by some disillusioned cop at the dawn of retirement. I didn't quite get it how you have to rob money when oil spills out of your land. Why he can't pay off the land with what the land produces, probably a legal issue not too clear.The characters were pretty traditional, a brainless bad-guy out of jail, a sunny boy chased by smiles of women out of divorce, a sarcastic old white policeman, making fun of his immigrated colleague, of Mexican Indian origins. And that's it. Country scenes are open space, blue skies, some fire and black smoke. Nothing exceptional.So why would I give 8 stars? Well the plot works fine, acting was good, except for some scenes a bit clumsy, like the fat girl in the restaurant, charming a sunny boy, or the scene before the bank, where the two policemen talk about who owns the land, describing the bankers as robbing the properties of people as the colonists robbed the Indians. Pathetic comparison, we hear it since 2008, nothing new since even before 1900.But then the end scene between the retired policeman and the bank robber is so great, so well played and original in terms of words, so true, that it makes this movie stand out.And the blues/country music adds to it too."
" Comancheria - turns in Texas dust like a western!
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,9,"My opinion---""Comancheria"" made perfectly by David Mackenzie, is certainly the most successful movie of the kind of 2016. The realization is very aesthetic and also very effective, enjoying a very good scenario of Taylor Sheridan, this movie brings us in the "" Univers a kind of western, thriller, road-movie! But quite effective with a perfect distribution with actors who have carried their respective roles to the maximum of their art. First of all, Chris Pine who gives us one of his best performances, then Jeff Bridges and then turns into an anachronistic sheriff, and finally Ben Foster who impressed by his most successful performance, you mix everything: realization, screenplay, music, decor Natural and leading interpretation, and you will only make a very good movie, a success of its kind. I highly recommend it."
" Entertaining though slightly over hyped
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,7,"Hell or High Water has received much praise from critics and from the Academy. This film was released during the summer of 2016 and at the time it was overlooked, but since being nominated for a few Oscars, it has picked up and is quite well known for movie fans. The acting from the leads are all well, as is the script and writing. There are few tense moments but the film never fully has much suspense which one had assumed. When thinking about it, it is quite simple with no turns or twists. It reminds of the Town, though in that film I find superior since the audience had more of a connection and care for it lead characters, and there was more of a buildup to the climax.This film is quite predictable with its ending, they could have went with another direction instead of the typical Hollywood fair but to some, it worked. Overall, Hell or High Water is an entertaining brainless action/crime heist film. Although not as amazing as it's been panned out to be."
" A slice of dystopian America with acting that leaves me forgetting they're actors.
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,10,"One of the best movies in the last ten years. Chris Pine never impressed me much until this. He and Ben Foster were sublime in their portrayal of the disposable majority in our country. Hell or High Water is a dissertation on the reality of the lie that is called the American dream and how two brothers made it happen despite the 1%ers best efforts to rape us and our ""once great"" country. This movie finds a moral high ground justifying their tactics against a system of hypocrites and corporate thieves that are the 1% and their enforcers. I can only hope this movie inspires a wave of copy cats, in every detail. Watching this film will embolden every person abused by our country. I look forward to growing old with both of them.The essence of this movie and the hopelessness 99% of us feel is summed up in the conversation between the two corporate enforcersNative American pig speaking to the typical WASP pig: A long time ago your ancestors was the Indians until someone came along and killed them. Broke em down made you into one of them. 150 years ago all this was my ancestors land. Everything you could see, everything you saw yesterday. Until the grandparents of these folks took it. Now it's been taken from them. Cept it ain't no army doin' it, it's those sons of bitches right there. points at Texas Midland BankA slice of dystopian America that leaves me with hope, with acting that leaves me forgetting they're actors."
" Finally A High Tide Film
",2017-04-04 00:00:00,10,"Hell or High Water is a film that moves in a deliberate manner.It's a modern day Western yet the horses in this film are not the galloping kind. It's horsepower lays under the hood of a getaway car of two unassuming bank robbers.These aren't your infamous gangster types but rather two brothers on the shortest end of the economic downturn. People who faced job losses, home foreclosures, petty jail time, family breakdowns and in some cases, their very life. All just trying to stay afloat of the sordid mess created by corporate greed.The story touches on big bank bailouts and how that money scooped up hard earned working class assets for pennies on the dollar. The real tragedy is knowing this is an American reality rather than just a fictional story portrayed in this film.Chris Pine is brilliant as Toby, a man coming off the heels of divorce and a dying mother. He's trying to save the family farm on the verge of foreclosure due to his mother's long illness. Despite the harsh hand life has dealt Toby; he's determined pass something on to his sons. Even if it means robbing banks to do so. He enlists his ex-con brother, played by Ben Foster, to help.While Toby executes each robbery with skill and precision, brother Tanner is a bit more risky and reckless. Foster is also brilliant as the wild and unrestrained Tanner, who himself is determined to never see the inside of a jail cell again.Toss in some everyday citizens who are in no hurry to turn them in, and the film takes on a striking working man's mythos.With seasoned actor Jeff Bridges as the easy-going yet methodical sheriff on their trail; we have a spectacular Western crime drama worthy of every award it receives.Finally, after a long cinematic drought, we have a high tide film worth it's weight in gold."
" An Amazing Story
",2017-04-04 00:00:00,9,"When I started to watch this movie, I wasn't sure what to expect. The opening sequence answered all those questions for me.I was sucked in immediately. The bank robbery was done so well. It felt realistic. No pointless explosions or unbelievable action sequences. The men doing the robberies immediately had you asking why they were doing this. The victims had realistic reactions; the feisty older woman, the scared teller, the old man with a gun and nothing to lose. The background of these two men come out shortly after the opening sequence. At that point I was all in. Everything just fits. The music matches up with the scenes. The choices for the roles were perfect. The colors and scenes make you feel like you are in a small town in the middle of nowhere out west.The action scene at the gas station had a punch that looked so realistic. I think scenes like that were why I enjoyed this movie so much. It felt real.The police officers story line is also very well done. It is a good cop, bad cop scenario, but not in the typical fashion. They make you almost not know who to root for, the robbers or the cops. It really is quite amazing how well the director and writer put you in an argument with yourself on who you want to come out the winner.There are so many great scenes in the movie. The father-son talk just before the final robbery. The scene with the officers talking, and it almost appears to dawn on them that the bank is almost the real enemy, the cause of so many of society's problems. The brothers wrestling while a country music song plays in the background.You knew how the last robbery was going to play out, yet it was done so well it was still perfect. It still had a twist that was unexpected. There was a death that shook you no matter what side you were rooting for. And the emotion that came immediately after was so passionate. I loved this movie. It is one of the best I have scene recently. It had a great story, one that had you rooting for all involved. You felt the pain and the struggle behind the robbers choices, the love they had for each other, the pain on how life played out. You also felt the the fight the officers had in wanting justice, the respect between them almost identical to the brothers."
" Fantastic but the ending missed the mark.
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,8,"Fantastic story and cast. Come hell or high water two brothers begin robbing banks owned by the very corporation that is attempting to snake their late mama's property. What follows is a thrill ride of a movie. Ben Foster and Chris Pine portray the brothers, while Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham play the Rangers hot on their trail. Great job, but the ending left me wanting more as it was not definitive."
" Southern bank robbers
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,8,"I'm not a big fan of cowboys neither the Southern American accent. I think you gotta live there to appreciate your own kind. I wouldn't last a week between those rednecks. But watching a movie like Hell Or High Water is totally different. You couldn't expect anything else than a fat Southern accent and the cowboy bank robbers played by Ben Foster and Chris Pine are just perfect in their roles. Jeff Bridges was also excellent as the almost retired ranger, with his mild sarcasm and no-need-to-rush-action. The whole movie feels like slow motion except during the robberies but it's a delight to watch. Great scenery's with a good story-line, great dialogues, what else you could ask more? I really enjoyed this far-from-my-bed-movie and I'm sure a lot of other people will as well."
" A good politically incorrect movie.
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,10,"These days it is hard to find a decent movie that's not politically correct with race, gender, or religion. This movie is a great movie for those of us who are looking for an action packed movie with a good plot line. Any bad reviews and ratings will mention politically incorrect issues, but for those of us who are looking for good movies with a decent amount of action and comedy this is for you. A good amount of ""adult"" comedy that is great as well as a decent plot line. All in all, its good movie for those of us who aren't ""Sensitive."" It's worth the time."
" Don't Waste Your Time
",2017-03-31 00:00:00,2,"This was up for an Academy Award? The very first scenes are a conglomeration of clichés, and it gets worse as the movie goes along. I didn't like anything about this movie with the possible exception of SOME of Jeff Bridges performance. I kept expecting things to turn around. People loved this film. The two brothers were terrible in every regard. With every new misstep, I was thinking it couldn't get any worse, and then the movie would go to a new scene. A 1000 words isn't enough to describe the reasons why this movie sucked."
" Really dumb plot - Spoiler Alert
",2017-03-31 00:00:00,6,"Spoiler alert How would Jeff Foxworthy sum up the absurd nature of this plot? ""If you can't get a loan from someone for $43,000 on an asset that will generate $50,000 a month, then you might be a redneck."" Only an idiot would think this is a great plot. Hell just borrow the money from their lawyer and pay him back $100,0000 and take no risk at all. Otherwise the cinematography and the acting were fine."
" The Brothers Grim(m) meet In the Heat of The Night
",2017-03-30 00:00:00,5,Atmospheric take on the Texas landscape and people. Good acting and suitably somber music. Brothers in debt with the risk of losing land resort to bank robberies. The problem with this picture is the moral stance of the film makers being to side with the brothers who commit serious crime and murder. So they are portrayed as the good guys whilst the banks and the police etc are the bad guys. Reduce my vote by 3 marks to: 5/10.
" Almost a western, very humane.
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,8,"""Hell or High Water"" is a movie that doesn't attract large audiences, hence why its theatrical release was quite small. But then again these kind of movies need to exist, and not only on home video. I would've enjoyed this one in a theater, but my only option was to wait for the DVD. Not that it's a bad movie to watch at home, it's certainly not.Everyone has already said that this movie feels like a western. They are right. They're not talking about gunfights, but simple, good characters in a certain environment instead. The characters are all at the verge of their destiny. As soon as the movie starts, you feel that there is an end sneaking upon these people, you instantly perceive these characters as tragic. Same with the environment: people are poor, losing their jobs and houses, these small desert towns are nearly empty. It's a perfect setting for a simple story.Don't think of ""Hell or High Water"" as an action movie. It won't deliver as such. Think of it as a character-driven little story. One could say it's a crime movie, but it's more like drama. It's a subdued drama, since it doesn't try to force you to care. It's not a pretentious tear-jerker designed to manipulate your feelings. The story and the characters have plenty of humanity. The struggles feel real and nothing is too much on the nose, which allows the characters (and actors) to breathe, to just do their job in a more natural manner.Everyone is very good in this movie. First of all, slow clap to Chris Pine. He's not just a pretty boy anymore, he really did a good job. But Ben Foster was simply great. I've been missing that guy. He's a really good actor, but doesn't seem to work that much and too often gets stuck in bad or mediocre movies. Not this time, good job Ben. Of course Jeff Bridges is really good, that's a given, but so is his partner Gil Birmingham. Everyone on the screen is good, even the few supporting actors and extras. It's rewarding to watch a movie where the actors can actually do their job, and where people responsible for the project actually care about the art form.I haven't seen any movies from director David Mackenzie, but after this I just might. The direction was solid, but so was Taylor Sheridan's script. Sheridan is someone who just came out of nowhere, seemingly. He scripted the great ""Sicario"", and now this. Hollywood, give this man jobs. All the jobs. I'm very interested in seeing his next movie. Good screenwriters are very, very rare nowadays.The movie is well-shot too. It's not trying to impress you, there aren't a lot of in-your-face fancy shots, but must like the movie itself, it's subdued and conveys a lot of expression nonetheless. The music by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis was a welcome thing.I don't really have a lot of gripes about this movie. It didn't quite strike me as a modern masterpiece, so perhaps I would've wanted a little more...something. The ending left something to be desired, I guess. I would've hoped for a little more punch. Perhaps some more edge, excitement and sentimentality, but I also have to acknowledge that ""Hell or High Water"" was so good because it lacked some of these things. It could have felt forced and compromised otherwise.In conclusion, it's a very good movie. A well-crafted and charming film that's allowed to be what it is, and where the little things matter. I'm happy I bought it."
" old western motif in modern times
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,8,"Toby Howard (Chris Pine) is divorced and older brother Tanner Howard (Ben Foster) is a recently released bank robber. Their mother recently died after a long illness. Together, they go on a spree robbing branches of Texas Midlands Bank. Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) is investigating. He thinks that they're on a mission to gather a set amount from the small quick robberies.This movie takes all the old western concepts and brings them out to the modern time. They even have cowboys driving cattle on the run from a fire. Each one of these people realizes that times have passed them by and the world is changing. The acting is more than solid. Pine and Foster have great sibling chemistry. Jeff Bridges is comfortably acting within his range. The best character is the old cranky waitress. Her scene is hilarious. There is a tension and a sadness with these characters. It's a really compelling world."
" See you in High Water
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,7,"Hell or High Water (7 out of 10) is a very good film overall and is certainly worth a watch. I wanted to get that out of the way because I have a serious complaint about this film. Hell or High Water spends most of its time in a realistic place. It paints a picture of two brothers who have a realistic life with believable relationships with both each other and the world around them. It also paints a realistic scenario that, while not without holes, certainly gives a purpose behind the bank robbing and other shenanigans. Hell and High Water is also a fable. Not quite of the Magic Realism kind that one easily could have seen this film drift into but of the wish fulfillment kind. The kind one would expect in a children's adventure. In other words the ending of The Goonies. Now one could easily argue if The Goonies ending worked for well The Goonies but it simply doesn't strike true to a film that admittedly was getting looser with reality as it went along. Upon reflection one certainly, could imagine that the writer or director was well aware that they were drifting into fable territory and simply loosened the rules of the world of the film as events progressed. I certainly am willing to give this finely crafted film this. The ending just seemed too clean for a film so otherwise grounded. The equivalent of a ghost pirate ship drifting in the background.Speaking of endings souring an otherwise fine experience. The inclusion of a blasting Black Sabbath song at the end of the first Iron Man worked because well it's and Iron Man movie and it's an Iron Man song. This film is drifting quietly into the sunset and suddenly we are blasted with this loud obnoxious country rock song (Outlaw State of Mind by Chris Stapleton) that doesn't fit the scene, or mood and honestly at that point doesn't fit the film. The film overall is great, The acting is more than solid all across the board and the film spends the vast majority of its running time in a good place. Like I said a very good film overall."
" Great Contemporary Western
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,10,"One of my favorite films of 2016. The writing and acting are great. I was a little skeptical of Chris Pine going in, but he did a good job. Not award-worthy, but a solid performance. I think this is a good movie for fans of No Country for Old Men, but it's not a rip-off by any means. It's also faster-paced."
" the western modernized
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,9,"This is a modern western and just the fact that its story works makes it worth a mention. The western is more confined than most genres to a time period and placement, and the world has largely forgotten the old-fashioned stagecoaches, horseback riders and cattle wranglers of one hundred years prior. A philosophical western is even more rare, but it is always a genre that has lent itself to telling great stories about the law of the land and the lengths one goes to for their family. That's one thing the movie tells us (sometimes at point blank range) is that the times have changed: it is no longer foreign invaders and land expansion we have to worry about, but the loan companies, casinos and hidden interest payments that threaten to bankrupt our culture and way of life. The bank robbing brothers that Chris Pine and Ben Foster eloquently portray are not good guys by any means, but they are definitely sympathetic and desperate characters that are rebelling against a corrupt system. Which is a tale at the heart of any good western."
" ""Sometimes a blind pig finds a truffle""
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,8,"Bank robberies have been featured in many hundreds of films since the early days of cinema: The Great Train Robbery for example dates back to 1903! More recent heist classics such as ""Oceans 11"", ""Die Hard"", ""Run Lola Run"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises"" tend towards the stylised end of the act. Where this film delivers interest is in aligning the protagonists' drivers with the banking and mortgage 'crimes' featured in last year's ""The Big Short"". Add in to the movie Nutribullet a soupçon of the West Texan setting from Arthur Penn's 1967 ""Bonnie and Clyde"", turn it on and you have ""Hell or High Water"".Chris Pine (""Star Trek"") and Ben Foster (""Inferno"", ""The Program"") play brothers Toby and Tanner Howard trying to rescue their deceased mother's ranch from being foreclosed on by Texas Midlands bank. Rather than taking one of the ""get out of debt"" offers advertised on billboards – cleverly and insistently introduced in long panning highway shots – the brothers have their own financial plan: a scheme that involves early morning raids of the cash drawers of small-town Texas Midlands branches. But the meticulous planning of Toby, as the calm and intelligent one, are constantly at risk of upset by the unpredictable and violent actions of the loose-cannon Tanner.Since the amounts of cash stolen are in the thousands rather than the millions, the FBI aren't interested and the case is handed instead by aged and grumpy Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges, ""True Grit"") and his partner Alberto (Gil Birmingham). The pair have a respectful relationship but one built around racial banter, with Hamilton constantly referring to Alberto's Mexican/Comanche heritage. A cat and mouse game ensues with the lawmen staking out the most likely next hits. The sonorous cello strings of the soundtrack portend a dramatic finale, and we as viewers are not disappointed.The performances of the main leads are all excellent, with Chris Pine given the chance to show more acting chops than he has had chance to with his previous Kirk/Jack Ryan characters. His chemistry with Ben Foster is just sublime. Similarly, Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham make for a formidable double act. It is Jeff Bridges though who has the standout performance and one that is Oscar nominated for Best Supporting Actor. (In fact with Michael Shannon also getting nominated in the same category for ""Nocturnal Animals"", we can add 'West Texan lawman' to 'Holocaust movies' (a Winslet ""Extras"" reference there!) as the prime bait for Oscar nomination glory!)The real winner here though is the whip-smart screenplay by Taylor Sheridan (""Sicario"") which sizzles with great lines: lines that make you grin inanely at the screen regularly through the running time.""In your last days in the nursing home, you'll think of me and giggle"" schmoozes Tanner to the pretty hotel check-in girl: a come-on clearly worth remembering as it delivers the goods, as it were.The trick here is in building up a degree of empathy and sympathy for the characters on both sides. The 'bad guys' here are successfully portrayed as the banks. Before the 2017 awards, you could get 25/1 odds on this winning the Best Original Screenplay Oscar – but I would personally rate it right up there with ""Manchester by the Sea"".Deftly directed by Scot David Mackenzie (""Starred Up"") this is a film (the first of two!) that might well have elbowed it's way into my Top 10 of 2016 if I'd seen it during its cinema release. Well worth catching on the small screen.(For the graphical version of this review, please visit bob-the- movie-man.com)."
" Overrated 21st Century Western
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,7,"Overrated 21st Century WesternI don't understand how this movie became so popular. Is it good? Yes, it is. But it's not an Oscar material. A classic western story put in the 21st century. Already seen many times, just in different scenery. It is even boring at first half. I was close to giving up on it after 45 minutes, but then I realized it is too late in the evening to start some other movie, so I finished it. And I'm not sorry that I did. But I would not watch it again for sure. I'll try to list what I think is really good about this movie. Jeff Bridges nailed his role. It is the only deserved Oscar nomination for this movie. I especially loved his ""racist"" jokes about Indians and Mexicans, and perfect timing for them. Jokes are good themselves, but in Jeff's interpretation, they are awesome. Further, the soundtrack is excellent. And finally, Ben Foster had a few really memorable scenes. First, when he leaves the car and goes towards persecutors, like Rambo, shooting bursts of machine gun fire. Second, the moment when he says: ""Lord of the plains... that's me."" and then takes a bullet in the head. Everything else is mediocre and mostly already seen.7/10"
" This should have won several Oscars
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,9,"This is an absolute brilliant masterpiece. The fact that this film did not win an Oscar is just beyond me and just goes to show Oscars is more about political and cultural snobbery rather than objectively rating a film. This movie is so good that it made me create this account just to share my take on how good it actually is and how much this film can do. Sicario didn't appeal much to me, but i absolutely love this.Let me start off by saying that the story in the movie is not a ""deep"" story, its not trying to do what Shawshank Redemption did with the story, its not trying to spoon-fed you popcorn, this movie is more about showing some of the best acting you will ever find in a movie. Ever. Its so good your biggest struggle in this film is finding out who does the better job out of the three. The dialogues in this movie is outstanding, i was so hooked on the small talk that in most movies seems redundant, in this movie i was sucking it all up and i was buying it all. The cinematography was great. The acting is incredible. The characters are awesome and they bond so well, you get so committed to these characters you have a feeling they're all your best friends, you have a feeling you're watching a 7 season long TV series, its incredible what this does.This movie is by far the best movie in 2016. One of the best movies of all time in my opinion. The best acting you will ever find. Never liked Ben Foster, considered Chris Pine a Hollywood pretty-boy with a small acting range, my opinion on those two flipped on a plate. They are so great and the synergy between them is off the charts. Jeff Bridges is good 'ole Jeff Bridges. Hes a great actor with character and this role fit him perfectly, he just does what he does best and it comes so natural to him you cant even tell hes acting. He reminded me of a mix of Jeff Bridges in Arlington Road (a very underrated movie ahead of its time sadly) and a bit of Harrison Ford in The Fugitive.Jesus Christ this movie is too good. The story in the movie isn't an invention of the plate, that means everything else has to be great in order for this to be a movie to remember; the acting, the characters, the dialogues, the cinematography its all absolutely outstanding. You have to watch this if you haven't. Incredible."
" Not too many highs in ""Hell.""
",2017-03-10 00:00:00,6,"Hell or High Water is a moody cops and robbers film that follows uneasy parallel pairing of brothers ( one through blood, the other in arms) where the characters are more symbolic than human. It is a virtual poor me testament by nearly every player in the film as they gross on about life in boom or bust West Texas, the banks (Midland in particular) being the evil monolith and their cause for woe.With the bank about to foreclose on late ma's old homestead that just happens to be sitting on oil brothers Tanner and Toby decide to pull some bank jobs to pay off the mortgage. When one bank offers slim pickings the boys move onto another. Veteran Texas Rangers Hamilton and Parker are assigned the case and set out across the dusty landscape where they encounter more resentment than respect from locals while trading insults with each other. Toby and Tanner meanwhile seek out one more payoff to save the ranch.Stuck knee deep in cynicism and self pity Hell or High Water's cast from leading to supporting center on mistrust and betrayal as they launch from major to minor tirade between heists. Taylor Sheridan's script is perhaps too ambitious as his characters drone on about faceless thieving bankers, ageism, subtle bigotry, triggering, genocide and white privilege without creating anyone of much depth since they are too busy playing victims. It is little wonder psycho like Tanner is the lynch pin to any of the energy present in the film since every one else is in a victim funk.With the stilted dialogue spouting one declaration after another there is little room for the actors to stretch but Jeff Bridges does register as the aging ranger that time has passed by. Ben Foster's Tanner does the requisite unhinged role adequately while Dale Dickey and Margaret Bowman make the most of their time in a couple of scenes.David McKenzie's direction plods most of the way as he surveys a vanishing America when he should be developing character. Opening the film with a well shot and edited bank job he manages to even inject some graffiti editorializing within it and he never lets up cutting between the brothers posing and moaning about life's inequities as if on the cover of a John Mellancamp album while Hamilton needles Parker about his Comanche heritage during a languid stakeout in the wrong town. By putting far too much emphasis on the external forces that drive them McKenzie sacrifices character in favor of this fall back to explain their actions which remain remote at best."
" Modern west at it's best
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,9,"I don't think I have the words to express how fantastically dramatic this film is. As far as movie goers go, I may be an exception, but I have a complete lack of romanticism with the American West. I understand the merit of older westerns, but nowadays, they tend to just seem dated. But something about Jeff Bridges in a Texas desert seems right. I'm also a sucker for a good screenplay and some risky robbery scenes, and right off the bat this film lets you know that is what you are in for. The contrast between the four main characters, the two brothers and two rangers, drive the narrative to a point to where you aren't sure who you are rooting for by the time the climactic scene begins. So if you like bank robberies, Chris Pine's eyes, and dramatic scenes of cars being buried, you should check this out. 8.7/10"
" Great film.

" A modern western
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,8,"A modern western of quality, when I say modern, I mean it's a Western thing that happens in 20I6, yes, that's possible and ""At any cost"" is proof of that, a film with a smell and flavor of the western, with action , Duels, weapons, hats and Texas, but also with feeling. The film tells the story of Toby (Chris Pine) and Tanner (Ben Foster), two bandits who make assaults on bank boxes and their executioners, the film works on this quest for cat and mouse of the two nuclei . The film tries to pass a moral about not being villains or good guys, in the western, these concepts does not exist, there is only who draws the gun first, the film is great at doing this, even if it happens in the current times, we also have brushstrokes about seeing all Points of view and a criticism of the abandonment of the cities of the interior that are still sunk in the economic crisis of 2008. The photography is great, full of aerial plans, with a palette of colors that pulls red, the climate is hot, photography Is urban and at the same time gives a complete sense of solitude, with a spectacular soundtrack, full of country, you want to pack and move to Texas, the track gives the tone of the movie several times, can even play once or Another at wrong times, but it is always a treat anyway. Chris Pine does a good performance, nothing special, he fulfills his role, Ben Foster is well out of tune, his performance is bad and it is not the movie, the gold here is Jeff Bridges, who Acts more physically with his face, full of postures, while sitting, walking, looking, he is a legitimate cowboy, does not deserve the Oscar, but deserved the indication. And a compliment to David Mackenzie who knows how to record moving scenes like no one else. Finally ""At any cost"" is a good movie, for the lovers of the western has a much more special taste."
" The return to the western but with cars
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,6,"As I saw her, more and more I realized that I was watching a western. The difference is that it is nowadays and with cars. It's a good movie, what happens is that it has moments of rest that I do not like.It is a film that is not social, from my point of view, contrary to what others say, I think what it defends is the freedom of each one. Another thing is that you do bad things and the law will look for you. But it does not speak of social defense.He has a good picture. They are in the desert and the light is yellowish but not as bright as a video camera.I love the role of Jeff Bridges, the grandfather, good-natured, cranky, but it's all a lie. The others are very well, you think you are in that world.The problem of the film for me, are the dead times that the film has. Many planes that count nothing and some sequence that could be saved.The direction without being spectacular, without making spectacular plans, but knows how to take the film and make a movie that you want to see.Spoiler:The end, typically western, when the bad guy goes to hide in the mountains and the sheriff and the others are going to kill him. And typically American, he is not arrested."
" Really caught me off guard
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,8,"Hell or High Water really caught me off guard. I saw it for the cast and was blown away with their performance and the gritty tale of desperation. Bridges played his typical role very well (nomination) and Pine was the believable every man, but Ben Foster laid it all on the line and was fun to watch. Even though it was well shot you will be fine watching this at home. It received nominations for Best Drama Picture, Supporting Actor and Screenplay."
" Great Dialouge and Scenery
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,6,"This is a good all-around movie. There are times when the pacing slows and the movie gets somewhat sedate, while looking at them with that west Texas glow about their faces. You may find yourself daydreaming a bit. Then the atmosphere changes. The movie is good at delivering key plot points after slow points in the plot. However, the way the movie started, who would have thought this movie would slow at all. It is not full of action; it is a movie with very good dialogue and a simple plot. They need money to secure a life for their loved ones, and they ain't gonna earn it by working! When the movie starts, you think it's gonna be the wild wild west. Then it turns to this thought provoking, moody movie. The movie becomes a vehicle for the sheriff – Jeff Bridges. He's a better actor in his older age. All the actors are excellent. Chris Pine's range is a surprise. Ben Foster is great as usual. His Oscar day is coming. Nevertheless, make no mistake, this is a vehicle for Bridges and he delivers. The movie has great action when it has action, great dialogue first and foremost, and pretty good cinematography. However, it's being held back by the pacing and the ending. The movie should have gone all the way, a little more action, a little more suspense, danger and an ending that shows instead of imagines. A final showdown would have been nice. However, the movies becomes 'No Country for Old Men' on Benadryl."

" It's One Hell of a Movie!
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,9,"If you're going to make a movie based in West Texas about the destruction of the agrarian economy and the way the banks rape the poor and why so much of the American heartland has turned into a ghost town husk of what it once was, what better way to embellish the moments than to include the songs of artists like Ray Wylie Hubbard, Scott H. Biram, Colter Wall, and Chris Stapleton in it. These are the men who've witnessed the destruction first hand and sing about it regularly.Hell or High Water, written by Taylor Sheridan, directed by David Mackenzie, and starring Jeff Bridges, Ben Foster, and Chris Pine, is a Neo-Western story about two brothers that go on a bank robbing spree to help keep the family farm in the family. Soundtrack and score writers Nick Cave and Warren Ellis also included classic country cuts from Waylon Jennings and Townes Van Zandt in the film, answering the question for many traditional/independent country fans what it would feel like to witness a modern-day big budget movie with all of your favourite artists comprising the soundtrack. The answer is it's pretty damn cool.But Hell or High Water is much more than just a vehicle for good music. David Mackenzie has taken his little film with a cool soundtrack and made it one of the most critically-acclaimed flicks of the season, shining a greater spotlight on the artists and songs that are deftly interwoven with the story, and in moments with haunting and auspicious timing. Independent music artists know that awards aren't everything, but if Hell or High Water wins big at the Oscars, it will be no small bragging rights for the musicians involved.The film moves a little bit slow at the beginning, struggling to create the adrenaline rush you would anticipate from scenes of bank robberies and high-speed getaways. It takes a while for the viewer to find a personal connection with the main characters, and despite the true-to-life and naturally-poetic setting of West Texas, we've seen this many times before, and recently. The story of the retiring (or recently retired) lawman, in this case Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton played by Jeff Bridges, is a trope of many of these movies. Take Tommy Lee Jones in No Country For Old Men for example.When the intricacy of the plot of the two brothers played by Chris Pine and Ben Foster begins to be revealed, and the relationship between them is given time to meld, this is when the movie begins to take hold, especially when their plan begins to race to a conclusion, and risks unravelling. This isn't your traditional Oscar- contending film in the sense that it isn't primarily intellectual or artistic in scope. These elements are certainly paid great deference, but this is a film of action, plot twists, and characters.Where Hell of High Water does play to the Hollywood mindset is how it re-imagines the whole Robin Hood story in a fresh and relevant light, despite the age and grit that encompass the story in its West Texas setting. This film could have been set in 1980 from how so many of the buildings, places, and people haven't changed. But the story is very 2017 in how legacy farms and ranches throughout the United States— and the family ties that have made them the harbour of memories for generations—are being threatened like never before by a modern-day banking system that does not account for how estate taxes and corporate farming do a disservice to the interests of independent land owners.As Hell or High Water works towards its conclusion, the lines between good and bad get blurred, and the moments and characters hold much more weight. Though the film feels like an outsider for Best Picture, and one you probably watch once and greatly enjoy but don't feel the need to revisit, it does sell you on the idea it should be in contention for the best in a given year.Often it is mourned that music awards shows are not more like the Oscars, where truly the best films and the best performances are and is rewarded as opposed to a simple acknowledgement of commercial success. Yet as we've seen in recent years—including an Oscar for Ryan Bingham in 2010—the film industry can be a lucrative outlet for the artists that should receive accolades, but are often overlooked. Hell or High Water not only accomplishes this, it's one hell of a movie to get taken lightly. Let alone getting overlooked!"
" Awesome
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,10,"In West Texas, divorced father Toby Howard (Chris Pine) and his ex-con brother Tanner (Ben Foster) carry out early morning robberies of two branches of the Texas Midlands Bank. Though the robberies are well- planned, Tanner's wild nature leads to him taking unnecessary risks, frustrating Toby.Two Texas Rangers, Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham), are on the case. Hamilton, who is close to retirement, quickly determines the brothers' methods and personalities. Meanwhile, Tanner robs another bank while Toby unknowingly waits at a nearby diner. They take the stolen money to an Indian casino in Oklahoma to be laundered. They exchange the stolen bills for chips, some of which Tanner uses to gamble. Toby then has the casino convert them into a check made out to the Texas Midlands Bank – the same bank they robbed. With untraceable funds and gambling as a cover for how they were acquired, the brothers head back to Texas.It is revealed that the brothers' mother died recently, leaving their ranch in debt due to a reverse mortgage provided by the Texas Midlands Bank. If the debt is not paid off in a few days, the ranch will be foreclosed. Toby is determined to pay off the mortgage to ensure a comfortable life for his estranged sons because oil has recently been discovered on their land. They rob Texas Midlands as a form of frontier justice. It is also revealed that Tanner shot and killed their abusive father.Hamilton stakes out another branch of the Texas Midlands Bank, but the brothers don't show. Hamilton figures a pattern to the robberies and determines their next target. Hamilton and Parker are en route when the final robbery indeed occurs there. Pressed for time, the brothers proceed with the heist even though the bank is full of customers. A shoot-out ensues when a security guard and an armed civilian fire at the brothers and Tanner kills the guard and the civilian, but Toby is shot in the hip.The brothers race out of town, with a posse of armed townspeople in hot pursuit. After gaining some distance, Tanner stops and fires an automatic rifle at the posse, forcing them to retreat. The brothers then split, with Toby taking the money using another vehicle, while Tanner creates a diversion. He draws the lawmen off the trail to a desert mountain ridge where he takes potshots with a sniper rifle, killing Parker. Hamilton uses a local resident's knowledge of the area to circle behind Tanner, and kills him with a single head shot using the local's rifle."
" A scary portrait of a modern America, in which anyone can kill anyone
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,8,"So, here is a European perspective on this modern western. The fact, that every male from young to old is not only carrying a gun, but also willing to make use of it, is fascinating and scaring me at the same time. ""Hell or High Water"" is set in a world, where everybody could be killed out of nowhere by some random guy, you happen to bump into at the gas station. Every character in this movie has an aura of suppressed aggression, that is just waiting to be given a valve. The astonishing thing is: Nobody is actually questioning that and realizing the consequences, that come with this situation. Quite the contrary is true: Even the Texas Rangers, who are tasked with law enforcement, have no problems with civilians trying to hunt down heavily armed and dangerous bank robbers. They even borrow a weapon from them, if their own equipment appears not to be suited for the situation. In that sense, this movie is a fascinating insight into the nightmare, the American Dream has turned into. It reminded me strongly of ""Out of the Furnace"" from a couple of years ago. Both movies deal with self justice and governmental institutions, that fail to protect the weakest of society. Which in return leaves them no other option than taking matters in to their own hands. Based on the positive reactions to this movie, I assume, that American audiences really appreciate, how this movie depicted contemporary America. A story like this could never unfold in the same way in Europe. That alone makes ""Hell or High Water"" well worth a watch, because it does something, that all great movies should do: It opens a door into a world, you otherwise could not experience in your own life. Put this together with great performances and a fantastic cinematography and you have all the ingredients for perfect film experience."
" The power of two
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,9,"""Hell or High Water"" may have revitalised the Western genre, but it also revitalised the buddy movie. The bond between the two sets of men, one each on either side of the law, drives the movie.There is a touch of ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" about Toby and Tanner Howard (Chris Pine and Ben Foster). Being brothers meant there was already a close bond, but they are also friends and hang out together. However they have a dangerous edge and rob branches of the bank that is about to foreclose on their family ranch.The two lawmen who come after them, Texas Rangers Marcus Hamilton and Alberto Parker (Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham), are buddies too; two aging Rangers with Marcus about to retire. Despite plenty of bantering insults, you know these guys are tight. Their banter reveals insights into their characters.The film has a feel. As much as it is modern twist on the Western, the way the brothers hit the banks and then hit the back roads is reminiscent of the depression era bank robbers: Dillinger, Bonny and Clyde, Baby Face Nelson - with a touch of ""High Sierra"" thrown in.Jeff Bridges steals the show. He is fascinating to watch in interviews with Chris Pine and Ben Foster. He's a good listener and doesn't talk over people, he's a laid back guy; the role of the laconic, but determined Marcus Hamilton was made for him.The team of two that sticks by each other to the end is a powerful combination, and two is the magic number; just like marriage. The best cop shows in movies or on TV feature partners who have each other's backs. Newman and Redford set the gold standard for buddies as Butch and Sundance, Connery and Caine polished it in ""The Man Who Would be King"", and it worked beautifully for Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in ""Lethal Weapon"". There is something reassuring to an audience when mates face the odds together. It's surprising that filmmakers don't go there more often - it's more effective than the lone wolf hero - and there are more opportunities for great one-liners.Script, direction, photography, score and performance all came together on ""Hell or High Water"" - it's just about the perfect creative storm."
" Performances that blew away what seems to be a dumb plot
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,8,"'Hell or High Water' was an interesting view for me. Simply because I have heard reviews all over the board for this film. Some saying that this is the greatest film of 2016 and one of the best for modern westerns. I heard some say it was an alright film, nothing great nothing terrible. I also heard some say that is was horrible, boring, pointless, dumb, etc. You name it, someone said it. Now, with a Best Picture nomination, 'Hell or High Water' had to do something right to get that credential. Well, Oberrated is here to breakdown all of your confusion. Just kidding, but I am breaking this down my way... 'Hell or High Water' was great. As far as performance, story-telling, and fantastic memorable moments, it was a well-done and great film. I can not say one person had a bad performance here, not Ben Foster, Chris Pine, Jeff Bridges, Gil Birmingham, not one. Even down to Margaret Bowman who played the T-Bone waitress! This was a performance heavy film that transcended a dumb story-line when written on paper into an Oscar contender. (and I only say this because when I typed that summary section I realized, this is a dumb as hell story when typed out, just IMO.)... Now I can not sit here and say it is an all-time great and side with some friends who have said this was a 2016 best, maybe a top ten but not best. But I also can not say that this was a worst, and to those who have said it was a worst and was boring, they probably are the casuals who want a shoot'em'up film. But hey, everyone has their tastes, some just are simpler than others.So that is it. 'Hell or High Water' has tremendous re-watch value. It has incredibly memorable moments that I loved and simply fantastic performances that made this film what it is. Now, I can not say this has a chance at Best Picture, but that does not count it out as a great film. Highly recommended!-- Oberrated.com --"
" Succeeds not only as a neo-Western, but also as a fun action film as well
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,8,"Hell or High Water is a neo-Western crime thriller starring Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine, and Ben Foster. As far as neo-Westerns go, this one is easily one of the best. Despite its relatively simple plot, the film still feels fresh and smart thanks to its interesting characters and dialogue.Two brothers, divorced father Toby (Chris Pine) and ex-con Tanner (Ben Foster), work together to rob banks throughout small towns in Texas in order to pay off the mortgage for their family's ranch. On their case are Texas Rangers Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham). Thanks to the quick thinking of Marcus, the two rangers end up hot on the trail of the two brothers as they execute robbery after robbery.Featuring well-developed characters and some great shoot-out scenes, Hell or High Water succeeds not only as a neo-Western, but also as a fun action film as well. I really enjoyed seeing the creative ways the two brothers covered their tracks after each of the robberies, matched equally by the quick thinking of Ranger Marcus. The wide landscape of Texas makes for a great Western backdrop and the film's cinematographer makes full use of this. The film also serves as a commentary on the greed of the banks so we the viewers gain a sense of justice from the brothers rationale in robbing them.I rate it 8/10"
" A modern western of respect.
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,8,"Hell or High Water is a good modern western with a good cast, Chris Pine is great, Ben Foster is excellent, in my opinion he deserved an indication to Oscar, Jeff Bridges as always very good in his roles, the rest of the cast appear I do not know how to do it, but I do not know what to do with it. I do not know what to do with it. It's a very good story. I do not like the ending, some dialogues are uninteresting, and characters are also good, the rhythm is good, and the fact that the movie is short Help, Hell or High Water is very good, has good times, even with problems, has a good cast, is a very good modern western. Note 8.6"
" Very Good, but not amazing
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,6,"I'm sure this film will be compared to 'No Country for Old Men' a lot. Both are set in Texas, with a near-retired ranger chasing morally ambiguous men on the run. However, in that comparison, 'Hell or High Water' comes up rather short. The cinematography was nice for the most part, but at times looked cheap and mediocre. The music was forgettable, and occasionally really out-of-place. There is a scene near the beginning where the brothers enter their Mother's old bedroom, and the director blasts violin music at the audience, hammering in the emotion to the point that it took me out of the film. The plot was mostly predictable. With about 30 minutes left in the film I knew precisely what would happen, and I was proved correct. However, that doesn't stop it from being a really entertaining film, just not a great one. The dialogue was really hit-and-miss. The banter between the brothers was mostly natural and fun. Yet the banter between Ranger Hamilton and his partner, Parker, is really repetitive and forced. To the point it is obvious they are telegraphing an emotional climactic scene between them.Though I've listed plenty of negatives, there's a lot to love in this film. Pine and particularly Foster were fantastic. Foster has long been one of my favourite actors in Hollywood, and he's never turned in a half-arsed performance. In this film he's amazing. He was given permission to go wild and ham-it-up and he is compulsively watchable. Every moment he is on the screen, we are drawn to him. It's a shame he wasn't nominated for an Oscar while Bridges was. I'm sorry to say I don't think Bridges was great in this film. I think it may be that his character is near identical to Sheriff Bell from NCFOM, but everything about his character was predictable and derivative. He didn't feel real like Bell, he FELT like a Hollywood construct.The opening act of this film is fantastic, as is the last. Though it drags in the middle, the set-pieces are worth it, and I'm glad I saw it. It won't be a classic like NCFOM, and it lacks any true gut-wrenching feeling. But it's not forgettable either. And the scenes and performances that are worth it, and REALLY worth it. Give it a watch"
" Realistic, well-written film, with fantastic acting!
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,9,"Two brothers rob banks, for some reason, but now they are being hunted by the Texan police.David Mackenzie, the director of the very good ""Starred Up"", went on to create this modern-day western epic. Mackenzie really was one of the things who made this movie fantastic. However, he wasn't the best thing of this film, this lays in the screenplay, which I'll discuss in my second to last paragraph. Now back to the director. Mackenzie created a beautiful looking film. The use of light, shadow, composition, everything that there is to make a shot look good, was good in this film. The landscapes were nicely captured by the cinematographer of this film, Giles Nuttgens, who has previously filmed ""The Fundamentals of Caring"", an OK-looking film, so it was very surprising he created such a good looking film. The direction wasn't stale; the camera moved around, to create long, nice looking takes. An example of those lays in one of the robbery scenes. All of those scenes by the way were fantastic. They felt realistic, they were tense and, like said before, good looking. What David Mackenzie also did succeed at was creating a realistic film. Everything that was happening on screen felt like it could happen in real life. There were some scenes that were less believable, but you have to take the setting in account, and then it makes more sense. That's also something I liked about the film: they utilize the setting. It's not that the film could've been set elsewhere. It could only take place in Texas. The soundtrack was also very good. The songs fitted well with what was going on and they also made the movie feel like a modern-day western. The editing was superb. The pacing really hit all the high notes. There wasn't a single scene that was dragging, even though the film was very slow paced, slowly building up to the finally. The acting was fantastic; I am surprised that not all of them got a nominee. The whole ensemble impressed me, but the one that impressed me the most was the performance of the well-known Chris Pine. This role of his is totally different from the ones I know him for, and I like that he has stepped out of his comfort zone. He gave on of his best performances, which is also one of his most emotional performances. He really sold his role. Ben Foster as well was fantastic. I didn't see him, but I saw his well-written character. Jeff Bridges too was great. I like his chemistry together with Gil Birmingham, who played his colleague policeman. The two of them had well written banter and were a fun on screen duo. The screenplay was, like said before, the best part of the whole film. Taylor Sheridan, the writer of ""Sicario"", who's bringing out his big-budget, directorial debut ""Wind River"", which he also wrote, wrote this film. If there's something Sheridan can do is portraying characters. All of the characters were written with extreme care, and the film also takes time to develop these well-written characters. They were developed by small-talks and not by exposition. They were developed by giving small bits of information once in a while, so by the end of the movie you have a fully developed character. This also parallels the story overall. In the beginning we don't really know why they are robbing banks – I know it is said in the trailers and in the IMDb synopsis, but a reviewer I follow said to not read them, because it's more fun to find out yourself -, but after throughout the film you keep on getting these small hints and bits of information like pieces of a puzzle and near the end of the film all the pieces fall together, to form a fantastically well-developed puzzle. That's one of the main aspects I liked about the film, but it doesn't stop there. Like said in the previous paragraph I also liked the banter between Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham. The back and forward jokes were funny, just like all of the jokes in this film. Both of the characters were built on each other, which ended well in the climax of the film. The jokes may seem weird, because the film has set-up this serious atmosphere, so by having these jokes, you'd expect a theme-swap, but the film handled them so well, and the jokes fitted with the characters that made them.In the end ""Hell or High Water"" was a well-written and well-acted film, with good looking shots, and good tension. The film had set-up a realistic atmosphere, and the film was able to keep that atmosphere throughout the whole film. This film is defiantly one of the better films of 2016 and I would recommend seeing this, if you are able to. That's why I'm giving this film a 9.3/10."
" Great movie without any CGI nonsense
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,9,"For such a long time I've been waiting for a good movie without CGI and superhero nonsense filmed in the real world. Movies as they should be.The story is great, the characters are great and the acting is great. I'm not going to waste anyone time reviewing this in depth etc. If you want a movie like they used to make them with quality acting then this is it."
" Truly worthy of an Oscar Nomination
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,9,"One of the best Movies of 2016, with a pair of Protagonists at the center to be cheered on, followed by a Cop vs. Thief type of story. A complex narrative, combined with a stunning cinematography.The main strength of the Movie are the characters, revolving around a Heist drama that is not only effective, but it is thrilling, engaging. The characters are grounded just right, as they even bring lightness to the movie by involving #Humor once in a while.The movie does not attempt to create artificial tension in the form of fast cuts or action scenes, but creates tension in the form of #Dialogue and in the form of brilliantly filmed short-action. It's also the difference of dynamics between the characters that make this movie a solid watch. The story is well-paced, as it neither rushes or drags on."
" 'Maybe one of these bank robbers is gonna want a gunfight and I can dodge my retirement in a blaze of glory.'
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,10,"Taylor Sheridan takes us back to the concept of the Wild West but in his fine script HELL OR HIGH WATER he keeps the time and the locale contemporary – present day in west Texas. And instead of ornery outlaws he places his story in the hands of a divorced father and his ex-con older brother who resort to robbing little banks in order to save their family's ranch in West Texas. David Mackenzie directs with a fine-tuned sense of balance between humor, sensitivity, pain, and loss and manages to pull together a splendid cast of characters that gives a very fine ensemble performance.Following a series of armed robberies at a number of branches of Texas Midland Bank where very little money was taken, the idea behind the robberies is rather sensitive - the motive of unemployed oil and gas worker Toby Howard (Chris Pine) and his ex-con older brother Tanner (Ben Foster) just released from prison is to raise enough money to pay off the reverse mortgage that will forfeit their recently deceased mother's ranch if not paid off. Oil was discovered on the ranch and in order to secure the future of his sons and ex wife (Marin Ireland), Toby needs $43,000. After two of the robberies, caustic old Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) and his American Indian deputy partner (Gil Birmingham) pick up the trail and just miss foiling the next, and last robbery. To offer more would be spoilers, though the manner in which the story is brought to closure identifies the tenderness that exists on the part of both the robbers and the law.Both Chris Pine and Ben Foster offer excellent portrayals of two young men attempting to cope with life as it has been dealt to them. Jeff Bridges is in fine fettle as the old retiring age lawman who rattles off racial epithets/slurs to his good-natured Indian/Mexican partner in dialogue that is immensely memorable. Every minor role becomes major in the quality of delivery of a cast of surprisingly fine actors. Yes, it is a shoot 'em up contemporary Western, but it also is an extraordinarily well- written, directed and acted significant film with a fine after-burn."
" Disappointing
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,3,"Someone told me this was a really good movie. They lied.What a painfully slow, depressing movie. If this is what west Texas really looks like, it is one gawd awful hole. Filthy, depressing, and full of ugly people. With that as the backdrop, it's no wonder this movie sucked!The acting was good, and Jeff Bridges is always fun. But the characters had no redeeming qualities. I didn't care what happened to any of them. And the two main characters were stupid; well, at least the one brother was.I was really disappointing in this, especially considering it came highly recommended. Oh well. Live and learn."
" Old Country for No Men.
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,9,"Refreshingly original, brilliantly acted, thoughtful western/crime film. In a summer (or should that be year or decade) of vapid sequels, remakes, and overblown superhero catastrophes, who would have expected an entertaining, intelligent, well-crafted, suspenseful, character- driven, modern-day western with a brain. Riding on Taylor Sheridan's razor-sharp script and David Mackenzie's nuanced direction, Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine, and (especially) Ben Foster (along with everyone else who appears on the screen) inhabit this film as wryly humorous, heartfelt, vicious, painfully tragic, and realistic members of a society reaping the fruits it has tragically sown. Best film so far this year."
" No Country for The Dude
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,9,"FINALLY! An original, awesome movie to watch with nary any superhero spandex or sequel-itis in sight.This thing had me right from the get-go. From the opening shot of Dale Dickey to the final (verbal) showdown between Jeff Bridges and Chris Pine, we got some great acting from great actors, many I was unfamiliar with. But I have been a fan of Ben Foster's since I first caught him playing a mentally challenged student in the pilot episode of ""Freaks and Geeks"" almost 20 years ago. And he also was stellar here as an ex- con with a grudge and ultimately a death sentence on his agenda.So sit back and watch some modern day ""Old West"" bank robbers tear it up in the good old dusty Southwestern U.S. of A. You can almost see the grit from the dirt roads emanating right off your TV set."
" It's Dusty and Rogue, Like the Best of the West
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,7,"Hollywood Westerns are not gone, they just underwent a new tone and identity to fit with the times. We do not see any more of those shoot-em-ups against the ""Injuns,"" but instead a blurred line between sheriff and outlaw. Yet most noticeable of all, it takes place in the here and now, rather than the turn of America's economic structure.Hell or High Water, written by Sicario's Taylor Sheridan, shows some of those gritty details that breathe life back into the shallow, feel- good classical genre. Here, we see what Texans under the law truly act like: they use a bulldozer to bury their P.O.S. car under dirt to hide any evidence, and they throw their chips in poker to increase their luck, all with the right rationalizations explained about their backstories to help you understand their turmoil. The two black-masked thieves we focus on here, played by the greatly underrated Chris Pine (Into the Woods, Star Trek) and Ben Foster (3:10 to Yuma, The Messenger), make a living out of hopping from bank-to-bank as the only means to financially secure themselves. You normally wouldn't want to care for a couple of crooks like them, but once you learn their background, you'll understand.Sheridan's plot is not a terribly original concept for a modern-day cowboy movie, virtually copying the same tone and concept as the brilliant No Country for Old Men. This Western only sets itself apart from others by its lack of international relationships.Even so, the hearts of all the men living here will haunt you. Each of them abuses their second amendment rights, even the filthy-rich passerby at the gas station carries firearms at all times. The town by no means chose to side with these crooks, especially not the near-retiring sheriff, played with a compellingly rich voice by Jeff Bridges (The Big Lebowski, Crazy Heart). Despite his wishes, he sets off a cat-and-mouse chase to restore integrity to these disturbers of the peace. Think of it like a Bonnie & Clyde type of thriller, except without the fun, gore, and romance. Or better yet, a Thelma & Louise type of criminal's sympathy story, except without any strong female characters.Yeah, hate to break it to you: Westerns today still don't contain enough girl power like we'd expect from them by now. The female characters are either dead mothers we never meet, moral support for the main characters, or bankers who get harassed by the two crooks. If these otherwise talented actresses were made somehow more active, then greater dimension would have been added to make the script strike closer to home.Although the widely unnoticed director David Mackenzie deserves recognition for his compelling creation of Texas' true culture. In his view of the dead south, automobiles display the ultimate sign of one's wealth, and oil mines can be found in an average man's backyard. Although everything looks like the everyday mundane life for these inhabitants, several signs still connect Mackenzie's imagined world with the works of John Ford. A field fire seen in the distance from behind a herd of frightened cattle heightens the highly-saturated look of the picture, and the dusty texture of the art direction reflects the complexion of the men unqualified to protect the people. You even get a new take on the classic showdown between sheriff and outlaw- with a new psychological twist.Hell or High Water will last as one of those pictures made by men from the old days for men from the old days. Not everyone will come out from the experience satisfied, but for the thinking-type of viewer, Mackenzie's new take on a familiar concept will knock 'em out dead."
" Exquisite
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,9,"Hell or High Water is a movie about two brothers, robbing banks in Texas to save family property. Few key points that you have to know about the movie: 1) Cinematography - beautiful long shots of Texas landscape that just leave you drooling, amazing soundtrack (that country music...), great editing... Direction of this movie is just top-notch 2) Pacing - this movie is incredibly slow paced. But, amazingly enough, it only helps to make it even better! There are a lot of moments where the characters just sit and wait for something or just talk about something, and the viewer is not bored with it, because of the way it's shot and because of the importance of those character building dialogues 3) Acting - casting choices are perfect. Chris Pine as the brain of the operation is great. Ben Foster as an ex-convict - even better. But the person that steals the show is Jeff Bridges. He plays Texas ranger trying to catch those two robbers as a last case before he retires and his performance choices are just brilliant. He's just this old, kind of a bitter, constantly out of breath guy who is really more interested in the motives that drive our protagonists to do what they do than really busting them. Even the supporting characters shine in this movie! I loved both waitresses (especially 'what don't you want?' lady, just brilliant :), Gil Birmingham as Jeff Bridges' partner was also really great. Bottom line - grade A acting and characters development.4) Dialogues - just brilliant. Natalie's interrorigation scene, conversations in the diners, all of the Bridges/Birmingham interactions. Masterpiece! 5) Memorable scenes - like Ben Foster's assault rifle shooting scene, full of tension police blockade scene or final conversation between main characters. One of the best movies of this decade. 9/10"
" Modern western that delivers on all fronts
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,6,"""Hell or High Water"" is an American movie from 2016. It is probably the most known work by Scottish director David Mackenzie so far and the script comes from Taylor Sheridan, a successful actor as well. This is Sheridan's second screenplay only and after ""Sicario"" was also already pretty good, this one here is at least on par, especially because Sheridan shows that he is also really great in terms of comedy. Two thirds of this film are relatively light and the movie lives through the cool/badass dialogues by the two cops as a vital ingredient. The movie runs for 100 minutes and scored several Academy Award nominations, one of them for Sheridan's script, another for Jeff Bridges' supporting performance (is he really supporting?) and it also got in for Editing besides the crucial Best Picture nomination. The film is basically two duos of people from start to finish: the bad guys and the cops, even if you could say that at least one of the bad guys is not entirely bad as his motivation behind these bank robberies is somewhat honorable and we are also reminded at the very end that he never killed a person in his life.It is a genuinely entertaining film and a lot of this is thanks to Bridges. I am okay with his Oscar nomination, even if a lot of his great performance is thanks to the dialogues written for his character. More serious mentions like the one about his dead wife are not elaborated on enough for Bridges to really make a dramatic impact, but the second half of the film, basically everything after his colleague gets killed, is pure Oscar bait and I am not surprised he is nominated again, the second time after his win and no less than 45 years after his very first Oscar nomination. He has pretty great chemistry with Gil Birmingham and even if the latter is not getting any recognition awards-wise, I still hope it can boost his career. Now about the bad guys: Who would have thought that Chris Pine can make this character work as honestly I always saw him as a bit of a mediocre (in terms of range) Hollywood beau. But he did what he had to do here in order to make the film even better. He reminded me of the main character from ""Justified"" at times, only that he was one of the bad guys of course. And Ben Foster confirmed what realistic movie buffs have known for over a decade now, namely that he is incredibly underappreciated in Hollywood and maybe the one actor in Hollywood right now without an Oscar nomination who is most deserving to get one. For this film, it did not work out yet, but I hope it will soon in the future.Overall, this is a good example of a modern western. It plays right now, i.e. in the 21st century and offers pretty good performances from start to finish. It is also genuinely funny on so many occasions. One example would be the old waitress who almost stole the movie with her one-scene performance. Hilarious stuff there and she was on par with Bridges and Alberto Parker. Surprised that Parker is that old already, he looked great for his age. But that is just a side note. Now I said that this film is pretty funny, but it is also dramatically relevant and edge-of-seat stuff on some occasions, especially in the last 40 minutes. I myself would not say that this is one of the best films of the year, but western fans like myself (and fans of the previously mentioned television show) will still enjoy it and some of the scenes are certainly contenders for some of the best 10 or 20 (in terms of both comedy and drama) moments of the cinema year 2016. One final thumbs-up for the music in here. The songs used fit very well in terms of tone and atmosphere."
" Cormac McCarthy-ish. Fine, and more importantly it works
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,7,"For all of the terrific acting, and there is quite a lot (and notably Jeff Bridges' scene partner Gil Birmingham needs to be in like half the movies made for the next few years), Hell or High Water is sometimes a little too on the nose and I think I'm just a little tired of seeing Ben Foster, masterful and compelling and Foster-y as he is, playing sociopathic criminals (sure, he's good at it, but after a certain point maybe they could stretch - and Warcraft doesn't count). But it also has the perspective and approach that would have worked just as well if it was a Western set in the 1950's (though the Hayes code certainly would've changed things - only a little), as the plains of Texas and the honorable(ish) bank robbers and old-time ranger-sheriff face off against one another in a cat-and-mouse chase. As a quasi-Cormac McCarthy-lite thing, it's fine, and sometimes more than fine. There's even a half-Indian-half-Mexican in the other cop (again, see it for Birmingham), and while Jeff Bridges is his usual awesome Chris Pine is the one who really delivers the goods. It's execution is solid, if standard. It has vision but could've used more-ish.It's the kind of movie I thought was just 'alright' walking out, but thinking a little more about it (and stepping away from Sheridan's more on-the-nose commentary on the destabilization of the working class in rural America), it works. Or maybe it's just nice to see a wide release thriller, near the end of summer no less, that's more about characters and basic conflicts even if, well, we've seen some of this before (i.e. the 'old man just about to retire doing x-y-z as his last thing')"
" Do not watch!
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,1,"What a waste of my time! Looking at the 9- 10/10 reviews I thought wow I'm in for a fab movie night. Gosh I was so wrong!!! Slow moving, no proper story line, simple, mosh mash plot. It's simply 2 brothers,robbing banks for cash for Toby's sons to live on for their future.... but they have a money making ranch which was left to them anyway in their Grandmothers will. Turned it off thinking... wow what rubbish! Not sure really what else to write as it down st take much to put it into a paragraph. Price has done many more fantastic films this is a real set back for him. He needs to keep to the pretty boy look in films if u ask me he didn't suit the part."
" This is why I love American Cinema
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,7,"This is what American cinema ought to be. Hell or High Water is set in small towns with its steak houses, bars, secluded houses and oil derricks. It was smooth and entertaining like a well written crime fiction novel. I liked the unconventional and charming small town characters and their working class lives. I liked the plump waitress a lot (!). Everyone acted well. Nice locales. Awesome soundtrack. Taylor Sheridan is a writer to watch out for. Even though Sicario was just OK.I was not a big Ben Foster fan before this film came out. But he did a good job here. Chris Pine who played the subdued and confused brother was a perfect foil for the rough and impulsive Ben Foster. This is one of the best American films I've seen in a while. I am not saying this is as good as the American films of the 40s, 50s and 70s. But this is as good as it gets for 21st century American cinema.Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham deserve special mention for their chemistry and their back and forth digs at each other. I hope there are more films like Hell or High Water and not too many films about Mark Zuckeberg."
" Over-rated Movie
",2017-02-03 00:00:00,7,"I had high hopes & great expectations for this Oscar nominated flick but alas i was let down. I gave it a 7 and I think thats a fair rating. The story and film overall were good But the acting wasn't 'amazing' like some reviewers have stated ( many 10 ratings, cmon) nor a 10 in terms of overall greatness. Film was written well with a good storyline but i found some parts predictable. Both lead male roles did a good job portraying their Texas characters and the Texas landscape scenes were good in showing the vast empty land mass that is 'middle TX'. The ending was abrupt could of been better. Also, they never go into the Family story of why he's divorced, and why they only show a scene with 1 son and not the other was odd. I'm glad i rented it and not paid top dollar at the theater."
" Good Story
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,7,"A good cops and robbers story. Maybe not Oscar worthy. But a good story nonetheless. A modern day western that probably would have been received even better if it had been made 20 years ago (closer to the Savings and Loan crisis) The acting is strong and the story is well paced. Gritty cinematography works well for the movie and the ending fits the disparate tail to the end.You've got to appreciate a movie that your not quite sure how its going to end. The fact that the Hollywood snobs didn't say this movie is ""critically acclaimed"" means that it might actually be good.....and it was. Jeff Bridges still has ""it""....don't miss Hell or High water!"
" Not original, but as provocative, intelligent and gripping as it has to be.
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,8,"An original screenplay but not an original story that proving that even the most tired genre in the most commonplace setting can be done right while entertaining without the need to check the brain at the door. Carefully executed, with the right amount of slow pace and plot jolts to keep you interested, the build-up and the necessary ""conclusion"" are done just in the right way. In between, we can't help but see it through the analytic eyes of the character's decay as well as scrutinizing another American corner of Trump's overwhelming electorate. Hell or High Water is another amazingly shot film in year of gorgeous- looking pictures, as well as expertly acted by an always reliable Jeff Bridges, a devoted Ben Foster and a much undervalued Chris Pine."
" A Surprising Joy
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,8,"A divorced father (Chris Pine) and his ex-con older brother (Ben Foster) resort to a desperate scheme in order to save their family's ranch in West Texas.Although this is only the first (of nine) Best Picture nominees I have watched, I feel it may hold the distinction of being the most exciting. The typical winners are heavy on drama, or perhaps are socially conscious. This nominee defies that. And while I don't expect it to win, I am glad it will get a little extra attention.Best Supporting Actor Jeff Bridges? I love Jeff Bridges. Everyone loves Jeff Bridges. The Academy loves him, too. It's too early to say, but I don't see this as being a win for him. He is great as the old, crotchety, semi-racist Texas ranger... but it's not one of those mind-blowing roles that really get noticed. There was no special makeup or voice alteration required. I would love to see Bridges be honored, but I doubt it.Best Screenplay? This would also be great to see. Although the basic plot is simple -- brothers robbing banks to purchase the family farm -- the intricacies are wonderful, such as why certain banks are targeted, and the way the brothers ""launder"" the money. I was not a fan of some of the heavy-handed messaging. The idea that the American military stole from the Indians, and now the banks stole from the American people. The message itself is fine, but the way they were so blunt about it by having Alberto express the exact sentiment... it sort of dumbed everything down.Best Editing? It is my opinion that editing is very hard to judge. Unless you are an editor, you may not know what goes into the job. Also, the best editing should be flawless, and not obvious in a film. For this second reason, I would gladly hand over the best editing award to this film, because the editing was indeed very smooth, and the pace was excellent. Some movies drag at 90 minutes. This one, with its pace, could have been three hours and still enjoyable. Surely the editing is at least partially to thank."
" Best cinematography I have seen in years
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,9,"I just found this movie after watching 2 masterpieces - Hacksaw ridge and The Arrival. I must say I am much more impressed with this film.First off it is hard to tell if the story of this movie is a Western, Heist Crime Drama or deep socioeconomic study reflecting the state of affairs in an important part of American society.Script is very good, dialogues are very realistic and characters are developed just enough. No pretentious pressure on the spectator to bond with the protagonists. It is not a story of heroes or villains it is more a study of a situation with realistic characters with a story in it.Pace is slow for fast paced action lovers, but it is in no way bad. It just contributes to highly atmospheric nature of the movie and bursts of tension spice up the flow and fit very well in it.Photography is very good. Not breathtaking or spectacular but still masterful, and you can see the hand of the director and his team in carefully crafting every scene, and everything withing a shot.Scenography is mostly beautiful rural mid-west landscape and boring small towns with their motels, diners, bars, casinos and banks.Acting is outstanding. Especially Jeff Bridges, but I must say every episodic role seemed to me to be acted very good. Even some memorable performances of a couple probably non-professional actors.Sound is great, no dialogue is unintelligible, no music is out of place and action scenes are not much more louder than the rest of the movie.It is really extremely difficult to find any flaw in this memorable accomplishment of the film crew.This movie will make you think. It might explain to you why Trump won the last election. It could even give additional fuel for thinking to the participants of the gun ownership debate in the US. There is only one dishonorable villain this movie points a finger at - the banks.Some people are screaming out loud that there is a giant plot hole in the film cos having found oil on your mortgaged property means there is no motivation for you to get money through all this trouble. THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY ARE TALKING about. Mineral, gas and oil rights are very complicated in mortgage situations and none of the cases are strictly defined by laws. Most cases are regulated on contract by contract basis and in connection with state laws but in most cases contracts favor the lenders and in some cases finding oil can even mean automatic forfeiture of the mortgage to the bank."
" Superbly crafted film.
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,10,"An excellent film in every way. I cannot fault it on any level. A brilliant storyline, superbly acted and directed. Add to that the tremendous soundtrack and great cinematography and a film has been created which I will happily revisit time and time again. The wonderful Jeff Bridges, as he always seems to, gives real depth and integrity to his character. The relationship between Ben Foster and Chris Pine is always engaging. The brief, hilarious cameo scene from Margaret Bowman, an 88 year old actress, will forever after be etched in my memory. All in all, a real contender for the Best Picture Oscar. Win or lose, David Mackenzie has done us all a favour by reminding us that the best action movies don't rely on crash bang wallop pyrotechnics or high speed chases."
" No Country For Old Men Meets Fargo
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,9,"Despite not completely succeeding in terms of blockbusters, 2016 was a year were the smaller films got to succeed and He'll of High Water is a perfect example of this. This is a highly original, tension filled and character driven film that I absolutely loved. Hell of High Water was a perfectly paced film, were thrown right into the situation and we keep at the same pace for the entire film as we witness these bank robberies, it's never slow enough to bore but it's not to fast so that it doesn't take the time to build its characters, all the characters in this film are perfectly developed, they all have crystal clear motivations for their actions and there are no light weights in this film. Chris Pine and Ben Foster both give the best performances of there entire careers in this film, they both feel like brothers who are very different but in many ways very similar, they had amazing chemistry and made for a perfect emotional drive for this film. But in terms of Character interaction Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham absolutely stole this movie, like Pine and Foster they both felt like they'd known each other for a long time, they were hilarious together and felt like true friends who poke fun at each other but ultimately trust one and other. The bank robberies all feel realistic, you feel the quick and rapid pace of them, the intensity it real and it have for a perfect representation of how differently Pine and Foster operate from each other. While many characters in this film do a lot of bad things there aren't really any villains in this film because we see all their different points of view and it ensures that their are no singular characters to get behind. It's also just terrifically entertaining, the action is very well filmed and makes this film a pretty good re watch for me. My only real issue with this film is the fact that, at times it's a bit emotionally manipulative, I understand that we're meant to get invested in the characters but at times it came across as just needlessly depressing. Hell or High Water was one of the best films of 2016, its got terrific performances, investing characters, well done action, a perfectly paced narrative and it's a film that completely invests you in its story. Despite being needlessly depressing at times this is an absolutely fantastic thriller. 9.3/10: A (Phenomenal)"
" Reinvigorating the Western Outlaw, come 'Hell or High Water'
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,8,"""3 Tours in Iraq and No Bailout for People Like Us."" These words, spray painted along the side of a stained brick wall, tell the audience who the villain of Hell or High Water is and where the motivation for two brothers to tear through West Texas towns that are all but deserted. Boarded up storefronts, abandoned gas stations, debt relief and fast cash signs peppered with bullets, sand blasted homes for sale; the vast and sepia toned landscape that is West Texas seems all but abandoned save for these two outlaws, the lawmen that chase them, and the citizens who are protecting whatever they have left.Hell or High Water tells the tale of Toby and Tanner Howard (Chris Pine and Ben Foster, respectively), two brothers that go on a bank robbing spree across the plains of West Texas to save their family's land from being seized by the very banks they are robbing. The lawmen charged with hunting the Howard brothers down are a pair of Texas Rangers, Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham). Chris Pine's Toby Howard takes no joy in the path he's chosen in this time of desperation. It's a choice he struggles with and feels guilty for up until the final moments of the film, but the position he's in doesn't provide an easy out to his problems. With the burden of providing for his family and keeping his brother Tanner from going off the reservation, Toby understands that if he falls apart so does the plan to ensure his families safety. Even if it means sacrificing his own. Ben Foster shines as Tanner Howard, the unstable wild card to Chris Pine's careful but calculating Toby. Foster has always excelled as a character actor and his portrayal of the life long West Texas cowboy convict is done so with excellent emotional range and comedic wit that steals the movie away from his little brother, the just as voracious yet clichéd character of Marcus Hamilton that Jeff Bridges plays, and the emotionally grounded punching bag that is Gil Birmingham's Alberto Parker.The biggest success of the film comes from the comedic back and forth between the competing duos; it provides some much needed levity as you are beaten over the head with the environmental and orchestral storytelling of how desperate the wild plains of West Texas have become in a post-recession world. Foster and Pine's big brother/little brother relationship is believable and relatable through excellent shared storytelling and good natured ribbing. On the right side of the law, Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham provide the perfect yang to the bank robbing brothers yin; their particular brand of good natured ribbing is steeped in Marcus's desire to stay attached to the life he's about to retire from and Alberto's desire to show respect to this ranger that he doesn't feel comfortable with but respects and needs to finish this job. Writer Taylor Sheridan (Sicario, Sons of Anarchy) figured out how to weave comedy back into an old west style cop & robbers film that takes place in modern day. The banter in Hell or High Water provides the audience with a movie that feels like something old given new life.The characters on screen entice the audience to not take a side, to root for good to triumph over evil and for evil to escape the good. Similar to playing cops & robbers when you were a kid, the audience can easily switch sides after the first act, the second, and the third. To walk away from the experience understanding and appreciating the effort of the filmmakers to make you feel satisfied with the outcome, regardless of who your favorite was.The film also takes care to make the Howard Brothers into West Texas Robin Hoods; a point made clear halfway through the film when the attorney handling the money the brothers steal stating ""to see you boys pay those bastards back with their own money? Well if that ain't Texan I don't know what is."" Even Alberto, the half-Native American, half-Mexican ranger points out to Marcus at one point, while the pair stake out a bank, that ""a long time ago your ancestors was the Indians. Until someone came along and killed em. Broke em down, made you into one of them. 150 years ago, all this was my ancestors land. Everything you could see, everything you saw yesterday. Til' the grandparents of these folks took it. And now its been taken from them. Except it ain't no army doing it. It's those sons of bitches right there"" as he points to the very bank they are protecting.That's the charm of Hell or High Water. The moments of contemplating the right and wrong of the two outlaw brothers actions. Two other examples of this occur early on in the film; a working mom name Jenny Ann (Katy Mixon) protects the handsome stranger who gave her a $200 tip that's half her mortgage while at the same an old timer (Paul Howard Smith) is trying to make sense of the actions of these outlaws. ""Seems foolish, days of robbing banks, trying to live and spend the money? Long gone, long gone for sure."" In this film, it's back to basics. Two men, two guns, some getaway cars, and a simple plan.It's that back to basics approach, along with a fantastic original score and soundtrack provided by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, that keeps the tension level high for the entire 102 minutes of the film.Hell or High Water is a thrilling, western crime story about the desperation of the outlaws to save what's theirs and the duty bound lawmen trying to hunt them down. For all the ambiguity and slow pacing of the story, the film ends with a clear winner and loser and leaves you wanting another old west tale."
" A Spirited Family First Cowboy Movie with tons of heart and a stockpile of talent!
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,9,"This movie is about family going through life's worst crap together! I think Ben Foster should have gotten a nomination too for his gritty portrayal of a big brother to Chris Pine with a shady past but so much heart! This movie has it all action, bank robberies, police chases, tender moments and a few tissue worthy scenes! The acting in this movie is a master class for all would be actors and each actor brilliantly portrays his character with detail and endearing pluck! When you route for the bad guys and the good guys equally? Well, you've got yourself an award winning movie on your hands! Highly recommend this one and the hubby loved it too!"
" Best film of 2016?
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,9,"From beginning to end I was caught up in the atmosphere and characters of this film. It harked back to some of the feel of 70's thrillers like Thunderbolt and Lightfoot but was its own film entirely. Jeff Bridges is interesting to watch even if he is getting up from a chair! Chris Pine also holds his own. Special mention should go to the cinematography and location work. It really captured the downtrodden locale and empty landscapes well. I also enjoyed a lot of the bit parts in the film, which seemed to be particularly well cast.Ultimately it was just a solid script and direction to match. See on a big screen!"
" A movie that revives and reworks a classic format
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,10,"As a lot of people have pointed out, the plot to Hell Or High Water isn't totally original: the plot is that two brothers, Tanner and Toby Howard, are robbing banks to pay off the reverse mortgage on their family home. It's not original at all, but it does take several original turns:-As opposed to just focusing on the Howards, with Tanner portrayed by Ben Foster and Toby as Chris Pine, we also follow a pair of Texas Rangers who are pursuing them, Marcus (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto (Gil Birmingham) -The pacing and plotting is different: there's two bank robberies in the pre-credits sequence, then there's planning on the Howard's part and investigation by the Rangers, then the big shootout scene, then a quiet 8 minute dialogue between two of the characters. A normal Western, or even any other thriller would be building and building as it went on.-There isn't any 'villains' in the traditional sense; in a modern take (the last 10 years), the banks are seen as the villains.The other thing that does separate this and prior Westerns/Neo-Westerns is the sheer quality of work. Taylor Sheridan, who produced an excellent screenplay with 'Sicario' ups his game even further, with his dialogues in particular shining. There's an excellent scene where the half-Indian half-Mexican Alberto talks about how all the land that ""these people grandparents took from my grandparents is being taken from them, but not by any army"", which sums up a lot of the film, and gives Birmingham a real chance to shine. There's another with Tanner and Toby talking about their upbringing, which says a lot about how Tanner and Toby differ because of that part of their lives.The characters themselves are excellently altered versions of prior characters. Jeff Bridges is fantastic as Marcus Hamilton - arguably the best of the film - as he gives this old Ranger a real fire and fight, but also a humour that is natural to Jeff Bridges. Chris Pine, who has always been a good actor stuck in the Captain Kirk box, plays the desperate family man forced to crime to save his family, who's quiet but also very valiant - he's doing this for unselfish reasons. And then there's Ben Foster, who plays by far the biggest twist on the convention: Tanner Howard is a violent rogue, who is very much a live wire and fully ready to commit all kinds of acts throughout the movie, but is doing these particular robberies for his little brother's welfare, and Ben Foster channels both sides to the character with equal virtuosity, making a 2D stereotype into a guy to both fear and root for.David Mackenzie and Giles Nuttgens team up awesomely together as Director and Cinematographer. Both of them use very constant long takes specifically to wring every ounce of tension out of certain scenes - a classic example is Tanner's dialogue with an Indian where he says they are both ""Comanche's"", and the camera lingers long enough to get the tension to max, or the ending in which you tense as if something's about to happen. They also focus on the Mise-en-scene well enough to show the world and have an audience invest in it, even when there's no soundtrack or incidental music to enforce it.I can put it in words - I love this film. For me, it's flawless and will only get better with more viewings. If you like Westerns, you adore this, and if you're OK with them (like me), you'll love this too hopefully."
" A epic sleeper, modern day western
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,9,"This was one of the few truly great movies of 2016. This movie was even better than the highly predictable Manchester by the Sea.Being a box office sleeper this movie will not get the recognition it deserves. Ben Foster and Jeff Bridges gave outstanding performances. I fear however that tripe such as LaLa land will steal the Acadamy awards. The story was great, the performances were great, the music was terrific, the photography was good, AND the characters were so believable that you will be able to empathize with both the good and bad guys alike. This movie presented itself as a ""modern day"" western complete with lawmen, Indians, bandits, bank robberies, and a posse. What is not to like."
" When words are more exciting than bullets
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,8,"Its premise might be straightforward (two siblings resorting to bank robbery to save the ranch, and the restless Texas Ranger in pursuit) but ""Hell or High Water"" doesn't feel conventional. To some extent, this reminded me of ""Heat"" - not in the fates of certain characters, but just the dance between lawman and bandit - and the pivotal heist that can so badly reverse one's fortunes. But you basically know what you're in for with this, and can expect great performances from the three leads *(although the chemistry between Jeff Bridges and his partner was unexpected and quite pleasant). But since I've brought up ""Heat"", this was much more low-key and for me, it's the dialogue that really sets this movie apart. Long stretches of sun-blasted Texas scenery, enlivened by the occasional punchy one-liner. And in case that sounds boring, this certainly isn't. But for a movie about gunning up and robbing banks, there's more fun to be had when the guns are holstered. Top to bottom, this is a great movie.8/10"
" Steal from the poor, get rich
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,6,"Hell or High Water is a classic example of a movie that was made to please the masses. It's well done, well-acted, with performers who are perhaps superior to the unchallenging material they're doing.It's the standard thing about a pair of good ol' boy bank robbers, brothers, the older one (Ben Foster, who specialises in crazy) a jailbird who's either heading back there or heading to his grave, and the younger one, (Chris Pine, the story's hero) someone who we are supposed to believe was pushed into a life of crime due to unfortunate circumstance. He's the ""hero"", though I wondered more than once about the people whose money he and his crazy brother were stealing, and how they'd feel about such a person.The movie's other main character is just as familiar as the good younger brother, crazy older one dynamic. It's the ageing lawman, someone who is unrealistically forgiving of the crimes he is attempting to stop, just as the filmmakers expect you to be, and is played by Jeff Bridges as if his mouth is filled with cotton. The unspoken ""enemy"" in this story is the banks; the robbers and lawmen both seem to think they deserve it. They're not really on opposite sides of the law, here. It is assumed that the money the brothers are taking belongs to the rich, unfeeling and exploitative banks themselves. But is that really the case? What about all the hardworking people who have accounts there? The brothers are perhaps more likely to be stealing their life savings.This movie glorifies bank robbing, turning the robbers into heroes, but not convincingly. There is also the matter of the Bridges character and his casual racism toward his mestizo partner. Was that really necessary?"
" Over processed look substitutes for derivative content
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,3,"Sure were some pretty shots in this thing, so many it's like the tonal palette was a fourth character, in the same way lens flare was a character in the recent Star Trek re-imaginings, reminding us to take note of how much care went into the colour correction. Why the need for this fourth character? Perhaps because the story is so needlessly, dog-walkingly banal, the colour manipulation could stand in for gravitas. Riding perhaps on the faintest memory of No Country for Old Men, a film that makes the much vaunted so-called art of Hell or High Water look like a pile of chocolate bar wrappers strewn on the floor, this exercise in stretching a fleeting moment of acting into a two hour migraine is, under all the tonal work, daft and missable."
" An unoriginal story with little to redeem it
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,1,"The movie fails due to lack of originality - of plot, of script, of presentation (I'm talking about often muffled dialog, so bad that I actually turned on the English subtitles when turning up the sound didn't help). There is truly little that isn't a cliché. While there is plenty to criticize in modern American society, the story overemphasizes stereotypes. One is given a picture of rural dysfunctionality on par with a Trump stump speech. This is particularly evident when the two brothers are confronted by young punks at a gas station who for no reason verbally assault them and then threaten them with guns. At a time when conceal/carry has become commonplace (especially in places like Texas) this encounter is worse than stupidly suicidal. More importantly, it adds little (or nothing) to the already lacking plot. Robbing banks to pay off the mortgage isn't much to start with,but I'm sure someone with more imagination could have come up with something better than the weak twist we're given at the end."
" Great..until the end
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,7,"Really liked this movie. A modern day western, but am increasingly getting very tired of spending a couple hours enjoying a story only to have the the ending left unfinished. Do they think it is 'clever' not to wrap the story up? Is it supposed to be fun to have the audience decide their own ending? Many a good movie has been ruined by this tired and over used technique IMHO. I would have preferred they just leave the last scene out altogether. That all said I found the acting solid, the dialogue fitting, and the visuals riveting. I would have liked to see the law men's back story fleshed out. I kept asking myself , who is this Sheriff and why do we care about him and his deputy?"
" A decent western but I was expecting more! 5/10
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,5,"Review: I really had high hopes for this movie, after reading rave reviews but I must admit, I found it slightly boring because it takes some time for something to happen. Its about 2 brothers, Tanner Howard (Ben Foster) and Toby (Chris Pine), who go around robbing banks, to try and save there families land, after there mother dies. Tanner is the ruthless brother, who has just been released from jail and has a dodgy past but Toby has a clean record, and has spent time looking after his mum before she died. Whilst going through a separation with his wife, Toby plans to leave his kids there land, which has oil beneath it, but they have to buy the land before the bank takes it away from them. Whilst going on a robbing rampage, Texas ranger Marcus (Jeff Bridges), makes it his goal to catch the thieves before he retires, with his partner Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham), who questions his methods. When Marcus finally works out there pattern, the rangers finally come face to face with the robbers but Toby manages to get away. With the case closed, and the blame fully on Tanner for the robberies, Marcus works out that he wasn't working alone but there isn't enough evidence to takedown Toby, who played a big part in the robberies. It's quite a basic plot, with no thrills or twists, so I was surprised that it went down so well with audiences. The cast played there roles extremely well, and the chemistry between the two brothers is very believable but it seemed very one toned in my eyes. There is some enjoyable wit, especially between Marcus and Alberto, which lightened up the intense mood but I still was expecting more from this western. Watchable!Round-Up: This movie was directed by David Mackenzie, 50, who also brought you The Last Wilderness, Young Adam, Asylum, Hallam Foe, Spread, Perfect Sense, You Instead and the great Starred Up starring Jack O'Connell. He certainly has covered many genres throughout his career, and he was a surprising choice to take on a western, because he is born in Scotland and his last film was a prison drama. He done a good job with the script, which was written by Taylor Sheridan who brought you Sicario, and he put together a great cast, who were perfect for there roles. At 67 years old, Jeff Bridges has proved, time and time again, that he still has it, and with a role in the upcoming Kingsman sequel, Kingsman: The Golden Circle, and another 4 projects in the pipeline, he certainly isn't planning to stop acting any time soon. Anyway, I can understand why people enjoyed it but I still preferred No Country For Old Men.Budget: $12million Worldwide Gross: $27millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their crime/western/dramas, starring Ben Foster, Chris Pine, Jeff Bridges, Gil Birmingham, Katy Mixon, Dale Dickey, Buck Taylor, William Sterchi, Kristin Berg, Jackamoe Buzzell. 5/10"
" Rich Characters And Originality Stand Out In Hell Or High Water
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,7,"Hell or High Water is a very good film, but it isn't for everyone. Everything from its dialogue heavy scenes, to its casual, calm pacing could alienate many viewers. Director David Mackenzie navigates a relatively simple story with highly complex characters very effectively. Hell or High Water is the type of film that doesn't drag you along with it, you choose to go along and can get off at any time, but by watching the whole movie will prove much more rewarding.The direction is impeccable, as it showcases the beautiful but scary American desert and explores the evil actions of men who aren't necessarily bad people simultaneously, creating a powerful and interesting atmosphere throughout the film. Great cinematography helps create this atmosphere, while also generating the tense and exciting scenes that make this movie very strong visually.The acting is stupefying from all members, in particular Chris Pine and Jeff Bridges. They bring to life the three dimensional characters that shine on screen, and bring the vivid story to life. The screenplay is very strong, with particular praise having to go to the originality of it. On paper, it seems like another bank heist gone wrong type of movies, but it really isn't, thanks to the proficient acting and suburb character writing. There are some issues however. It was a very dialogue heavy film, which is fine, considering the dialogue was very good. But it sometimes seemed inaudible what they were saying, or it became easy to tune out what the characters were saying, even though it was important to the story. Perhaps it was a bad sound mix, or the southern drawls were too thick, or the fact that Jeff Bridges was in it, but it was far too easy to miss the dialogue which ended up effecting the overall quality. The pacing was also a bit of an issue. It was very different from most films, and was quite relaxed for a lot of the film, which led to a few dull scenes in the middle. On top of the mumbled dialogue, the pacing made the story more complicated than it needed to be. None of this, however, deterred how good a film this was. Hell or High Water had an amazing screenplay with terrific direction to bring it to life. The originality of this heist gone wrong story and its excellent acting and cinematography make it a stand out film. Some poor pacing and inaudible dialogue dragged Hell or High Water, but it still came out on top.3.5 / 5"
" Hell or High Water
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,7,"""Hell or High Water"" is a tense, character driven modern western that subverts the classic western idea of the ""white hats versus black hats"" by showing the point of view of both the pair of robbers and the pair of sheriffs hunting those robbers. The opening shot of the film is probably my favorite of the year: it is seemingly a static shot as a car passes by, but suddenly the camera begins to dolly and rotate slowly, following a car that has just come into the town in the background, with glimpses of a woman getting out of her car in the foreground as the camera passes by her. The car in the background disappears behind a building as the camera begins to float behind the woman in the foreground going into that building. The scene climaxes with two men wearing ski masks and holding guns suddenly jumping out from behind the building just as she is about to open the door. The shot is slow (it lasts about a minute and a half long), but it is very suspenseful and intriguing, perfectly setting up the following scenes as the two men rob two banks together. One thing this film does very well is suspense. Each shot is pretty much the perfect length, and each intense scene has the perfect set up and just enough build up. The director knew exactly when and when not to use music during the scenes, especially during one suspenseful moment near the end that is made all the more suspenseful by the silence during the scene.Each character is given depth and each one you understand, even the most despicable one in the film. The two bank robbers are Toby and Tanner Howard, the latter being my favorite character and favorite performance of the film. They are brothers and it is insinuated that they had an abusive father, who Tanner eventually killed at a young age in order to protect his brother and mother. Tanner is an impulsive hothead, and after he went to prison he spiraled into a life of crime and even more prison, leaving Toby to deal with their property and their mother, who died recently. Toby is smart, thoughtful, and while he isn't perfect, he clearly feels sorry for what he is doing and feels empathy towards others. He doesn't see his ex-wife or his children very often, but he does care about them. The whole reason he is doing this in the first place is to help them financially and make sure his children don't go down the same path as him. Despite their hard times, Tanner and Toby do care about each other as well, and Tanner is basically only doing this for his brother. The sheriffs are more normal. Marcus is an old, experienced sheriff and a bit of a traditionalist. It is insinuated he had a wife, but she died, so all he really has left is his job. He goes on this hunt with Alberto, a half-Native American half-Mexican that has a wife and kids. He was forced to go on this hunt with Marcus and is constantly teased about his race by him, although he doesn't seem to be a serious racist (he genuinely cares about Alberto, even if it doesn't always seem this way).These characters slowly unfold to us and their situations each begin to make more sense. The film is study of these characters but also of the death of the ""old west"", but doesn't view that time period with rose colored glasses. At the same time, it views the death of this time as a tragedy, but only because the big banks are taking these people's lad and money. In fact, these banks are probably the only clear enemies in the film.The film has a very clear plot throughout and some very intense moments, but it is very much a dialogue driven film that has several great small moments and encounters that are pretty much inconsequential to the overall plot. The cinematography is often restrained but fantastic, with several long takes that are barely noticeable. It is a complex and very well written film with some very good direction and acting that is engrossing from beginning to end. I recall a single short scene in which I didn't like one small performance, but other than that the cast was great across the board. It is unpredictable and suspenseful but also quiet and somewhat poignant."
" This gets my nomination for Movie Of The Year.
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,9,"let's talk about Hell or High Water! This movie was by far one of the top 3 movies of the year and if this does not get nods for some Oscars then we have a problem.Pros: This movie hits across the board. It gets top marks for acting, story, script, cinematography, and directing. Chris Pine and Ben Foster could pass for real brothers in real life I think. Oh and if you need another example of their on screen chemistry just watch The Finest Hours. These two guys are in my opinion besides Benedict Cumberbatch the top actors in Hollywood right now. If not any of the other movies I discuss this one deserves your attention.Cons: Nothing really to add here. Just my usual complaint, Should have been longer."
" People vs the system: contempt and neglect
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,7,"This movie is more than just about two rather sympathetic men robbing banks and an old blabbermouth of a cop trying to catch them. It's much rather about the context of the events, about the people who aren't directly involved but still have their say. And what they say is ""screw you"" to the system, a say that, as we could see in the last months, spreads far beyond the small Texan towns.However, giving a glimpse at some sore social and economical spots of the modern US isn't enough to make the movie stellar. And while Hell or High Water is without a doubt a solid product, with a plot that doesn't crumble and some mature acting from the people you might not expect it from (Chris Pine, for instance, definitely exceeded my expectations, and it was refreshing to see him take on a grown-up role for a change), it still lacks somewhat in terms of artistic design.Yes, the social and political message is reiterated over and over, loud and clear, but the story itself remains just a bit too shallow, giving you not enough moral choices to make things complicated. What if Jeff Bridges' character was less of a grumpy old fart constantly ridiculing his partner? What if the Howard brothers were less handsome or had sightly uglier motives or execution style? Maybe it would be less appealing to root for the ""good guy pushed to the edge by the unjust circumstances"". And while it would've definitely made things more twisted, it would have also made this flick more intriguing and exciting to watch.Well, maybe it wasn't the case. But even if Hell or High Water comes short in regard to artsy dilemmas, it's still right on about the Texan lifestyle, hard as nails, and about the people who live it straight, on both sides of the law. And that's definitely good enough to consider those 102 minutes well-spent."
" Really good movie
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,9,"One of the better movies I've seen from 2016 offerings. Storyline was just active enough to keep viewers attention but still maintained the slower pace of a typical hot & dusty western . Acting was really good - not surprising from Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine or Ben Foster but was equally good from Gil Birmingham, Katie Mixon and Dale Dickey. Dialogue between the two Texas Rangers was hilarious, believable and exactly what would/should transpire between two mature Texas lawmen who have worked together for a long time. Cinematography was so good that I felt the hot, flat dusty west Texas terrain like I was sitting right out on the blacktop of one of those long flat roads where you can see in any direction for many miles. I can certainly see why the Foreign Press nominated this movie for a Golden Globe award. Nice to see such a good movie being dedicated to director David Mackenzie's parents."
" Foster and Pine blend very well in this film topped off by a good jolt of Bridges gruffness
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,8,"I was not sure what to expect from this crime/drama film but I certainly was looking forward to sitting down to watch just how good actors Ben Foster, Chris Pine and the venerable 66 year old Jeff Bridges would bring this story to life. I must say that they did not disappoint me. The film opened well with the two brothers Tanner Howard (Ben Foster) and Toby Howard (Chris Pine) proceeding to target then rob a specific bank, The Texas Midlands bank branches. Very quickly we learn that Toby is the guy who planned the robberies and he is providing specific instructions to his older more trigger happy brother Tanner, on what they will steal. Specifically these two brothers did not want to engage in any robbery of the banks customers, nor were they going after the bank safe. Toby and Tanner's intentions were simply to rob The Texas Midlands bank branches that were located in smaller towns with less heavily secured personnel and/or without any security monitoring equipment. Their plan was to quickly take the loose cash from the bank clerk's tills and get the heck out of there.Eventually we learn why Toby (and older brother Tanner) are robbing only Texas Midlands bank branches and how much they intend to take them for before these two bank robbing brothers decide to stop. As the cash being stolen from these small town Texas Midlands banks is minimal the Federal authorities are leaving it to the local sheriff's department to meet with the bank managers and assess how to capture these two bank robbers who seem to be very cautious in how they select the banks they will eventually rob.The local sheriff is a guy named Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) who is assisted by his deputy, a native American Indian named Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham). There is a secondary story we are provided with which encompasses that Sheriff Hamilton is only weeks away from retirement and as such he takes great liberties in taking flagrant pot shots about his deputy's native American heritage. Although Sheriff Hamilton's jokes appear to be both racial and personal against Deputy Parker, they are merely to remind Deputy Parker of his boss and pal's imminent retirement. Are we to believe that as these two local law enforcement officers are hunting the two brothers who are robbing banks and their identities remain unknown that maybe Sheriff Hamilton may not live to see his retirement? Well I don't want to spoil the film for anyone but there certainly are questions that the audience is expecting answers to which keeps us very interested in the four main characters.I would not classify this film as a western as it is more of a crime/drama and specifically about two local Sheriffs attempting to figure out where these two unknown bank robbers will strike next. We learn that the older brother Tanner has that stereotype ""mommy and daddy never loved me"" mantra and this is why he is the more aggressor of the two brothers living without fear or consequences for the action taken.I liked the way the film evolved and the ending was credible. It is certainly a film I intend to watch a second and/or even a third time. It is a good story, with even better acting and a quality film for the crime drama genre. I give it an 8 out of 10 rating."
" Hell Or High Water is a tense, taut and brooding crime drama.
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,10,"Chris Pine and Ben Foster star as bank robbing brothers in this superb modern Western from Starred Up Director David Mackenzie. With a screenplay written by the acclaimed Taylor Sheridan (Sicario), Hell Or High Water is a tense, taut and brooding crime drama set in present day Texas.The plot is simple: the family ranch is on the verge of being repossessed by the bank, so Pine resorts to desperate measures and teams up with his criminal brother Foster as they embark on a series of bank robberies in order to raise the cash to secure the ranch. They are soon pursued by Jeff Bridges' almost-retired Texas Ranger as they work their way through a number of small, near-desolate Texan towns.However, whilst the premise here may be straightforward, Mackenzie actually offers us something hugely substantial. The quiet Texan towns and the desperation of the brothers are just some of the methods in which Mackenzie shows us how the global economic crisis has had, and still has, a devastating effect on people. We see a waitress desperate to hang onto a generous tip, houses for sale and a number of roadside billboards and posters offering loans and debt consolidation schemes. Indeed, the banks themselves are very much portrayed as the villain here, and as such it's very hard not to want to root for Pine and Foster as they cleverly seek to steal the money they need from the very branch they owe, so that they can make the necessary payments with the bank's own money.Considering this is a story that could perhaps have been set in any town, any state, or any country even, Hell Or High Water felt very much like an homage to the genre of Western movies but also to Texas itself. The sumptuous sweeping shots of the towns and absolutely gorgeous photography of untouched prairie landscapes felt as if they were intended to show the state of Texas in both its expansive and desolate glory, whilst providing the audience with a nod to the great Westerns of old (High Noon, The Searchers and True Grit all springing to mind).Credit must go to Mackenzie for superbly merging the old with the new here. This is ultimately a story founded on the 21st century economic crisis, yet set in what is ultimately a 19th century backdrop. One scene in particular that stood out for me was when the brothers were filling up their car at a gas station; a cowboy leaves the scene on horseback as two young kids drive up blaring out music from their car. Later, we see Jeff Bridges' Texas Ranger and his partner held up in their car as they wait for a group of cowboys to drive their cattle across the road. These were odd juxtapositions but they perhaps serve to highlight this fundamental theme within the film.Numerous references to Native Americans further enhance this idea; the acknowledgement of what once was. Again, though, there is more substance here, in that these references serve to point out an irony that the citizens of today's America are having everything taken away from them (by the banks) as the Native Americans had everything taken away from them (of course the circumstances here are vastly different). Most of these references were made by Bridges' character; perhaps the personification of this sense of 'the old'. Reluctantly approaching retirement and making constant racist comments to his partner, Bridges is world-weary and worn out with nothing to look forward to. Tracking down the brothers is his 'one last job' and one he embraces obsessively as a means to stave off his retirement. He is the epitome of 'old school' in his humour, methods and etiquette, but it is clear he is also terrified of entering a world he is unfamiliar with. It's a fantastic performance from Bridges, who emotes and conveys awkward humour, obsession and fear in his own unique way.Countering Bridges is the ever brilliant Ben Foster. The oldest of the brothers, he's street smart, unpredictable, ill-tempered, quick-witted and reckless; and the personification of ""the new"". It's his actions which give the brothers' journey an overwhelming sense of uncertainty and excitement and yet despite his copious flaws, Foster manages to make his character an endearing one.This is Chris Pine's vehicle, though. It's a restrained and thoughtful performance, and with that an intensely brooding one which encapsulates the entire tone of the film. It is Pine's younger brother who has masterminded the whole scheme to obtain the money, whilst getting revenge on the bank that has caused his family so much grief. It is he who has asked his brother to revert back to a life of crime. He is doing a bad thing in order to do a good thing, and there is barely a scene in which Pine is involved where we don't see the remorse and the shame etched across his face. It's a role which could not be further than that which made his name (as James Kirk in the Star Trek franchise) yet one he commands with great maturity.Mackenzie really does deserve much of the praise, though, for this fantastic piece of film making. Hell Or High Water is so steadily paced yet creates a significant amount of tension as a race against time evolves. He draws incredible performances from his leads, provides his audience with stunning visuals and touches upon themes which set this way above a typical heist movie or generic Western.For the full review, and further movie reviews, please visit: https://www.facebook.com/JMCReelReviews/"
" Powerful performance, boring story
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,7,"The movie is engaging in its complete beginning. Sadly the flow breaks towards the end. All in all I was really looking forward to watch this movie, as the cast is just brilliant. Finally Jeff Bridges at his best.First of all, the setting and the overall topic is really interesting – the bold and really sad looking America was already portrayed in ""No country for old men"" - but doesn't make the story better. Its about two brothers trying to make money by stealing money from banks. Bad boys vs. Police. Its nothing new. My hope was, that the actors would make at least the story better. But doesn't come true at all. The two brother brings an emotional depth into the story that are rare in the genre.I still really like the first half of the movie, which brings back the old western mood. Quiet and unexpected situations. Dialogues sometimes to long but memorable. I loved to watch it but felt bored in the second half."
" Beautifully shot but overrated
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,6,"I held off watching this because the trailer didn't really impress me, but I decided to check it out in the end as it's one of the few films of last year that I hadn't seen which the critics had been raving about. It started off really well, I was quite engaged in the first act but by the end I was bored. The characters aren't that interesting or likable and the story was so predictable it was disappointing. I was hoping for a little more than just a cut and paste job from other films. We've seen so much of this countless times before and for me this just didn't stand above any of the other heist/chase films. One of the biggest issues for me was that the film requires so much suspension of disbelief in order for you to go along with what's going on that by the time it hammers its point home you just don't really feel emotionally invested. It's still good; the acting is solid and the cinematography is stunning, there are a few funny moments and what little action there is is well handled but overall I didn't think it was extraordinary like some other people have, so my advice is if you like the trailer, watch it, if the trailer didn't entice you then don't rush to it."
" quite brilliant, but not that refreshing
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,7,"One thing that got on my mind through the whole movie was: i've seen this before. All of this. I don't think I'm the only one who gets Coen brothers vibes from this movie, or generally speaking, from a certain genre which is thriller/western drama with an old ranger who's not very enthusiast about his impending retirement and a couple of spoiled thieves, one smart the other one crazy. Nevertheless, characters - especially in the second half of the movie - begin to look more and more tridimensional, and more than once Taylor Sheridan's screenplay surprised me, not only for a smart and quite subtle way of showing the main themes of the movie, such as Texas' citizens economical issues and the even more interesting father's responsibilities and his duties, but especially because it didn't lack of a huge amount of suspense and unpredictability - and honestly I was quite worried about that. Pine gives a surprisingly real performance, while Ben Foster is simply exquisite and charming in his craziness, and the relationship between the two brothers is as genuine as the two lawmen's, Marcus - an amusing Jeff Bridges - and Alberto. The final showdown between the good and the bad (what's the difference anyway? but most of all, there's one?) is thrilling and totally not what I was expecting. Interesting characters, deep performances, not much refreshing in my opinion but very enjoyable anyway."
" Hell or high water best film of 2016
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,10,"I've only watched a handful of movies in 2016 cause I'm really picky about the movies I watch I hate watching bad movies so when I heard there's a movie starring Jeff Bridges and Ben Foster it was already a must watch film . The two of them I admire for their great acting abilities . Second when heard it was a crime story about bank robbers with a fugitive feel it was right up my alley cause I've been looking for such a movie for 4 years now. This is the best western I've seen in a long time albeit a modern western . The writing and directing was perfect both the dialogue from the bank robbers and the rangers was amazing .It created suspense and build the characters .The pacing was spot on .There were no empty scenes . The director captured the landscape brilliantly and brought more feel to the film. The cast were great ,I must say Chris Pine surprised me I like him but I never thought he was capable of such a performance . I have nothing to say about Ben and Jeff except great as usual . It's a must watch film about down on their knees brother who wants to save their family ranch and the the ranger looking for one last job before he retires . There was a few plot twist that I didn't expect .10/10 they don't make many films like this anymore ."
" An Outsider View Of America
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,6,"I thought this might have been very similar to NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN by the Coen brothers , a feeling reinforced by it picking three Golden Globe nominations . After seeing it I'm slightly puzzled why it has been touched by such acclaim . Giving it some thought I did conclude the screenplay was written by Taylor Sheridan whose main career in Hollywood is as an actor and actors do get overly praised if they either write or direct a production while it's impossible not to like Jeff Bridges and there's always an element of recognising a film at award voting that has traditional commercial appeal . Don't get me wrong because this film is a competent character driven thriller but probably no more than that My main gripe is that it does try and sugar coat the Howard brothers just a little too much . They're driven in to becoming bank robbers due to debts . Hmmm . Let me think now . Would it be too simplistic to have a couple of characters rob banks simply because they're a pair of greedy dumbasses ? Do I detect an element of post modernist morality where no one is responsible for their negative actions ? I much preferred the post modernism of New Hollywood where if someone robs a bank it's an act of nihilistic amorality or just simple greed One aspect of this film that is interesting is that it was directed by a Scotsman David MacKenzie and it shows in a some what clichéd outsider of America in general and Texas in particular . We see vast grasslands interrupted by oil drilling , cowboys and Indians still exist and it's a state where gun possession is almost universal which possibly makes an unintentional point that if you're a dumbass intent on committing armed bank robbery do it somewhere that doesn't have armed citizens"
" A Tale of Bank Robbers That Emits Grittiness and Texas Charm
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,8,"This was one of the movies I just had to see with the buzz around it. I had heard more than a few times that it was the best movie of the year, so I waited patiently for a chance to watch it. It didn't get a big release so I had to be watch it on home video. The critics were right about this one, it's thrilling and it walks the fine line between a character driven drama and surprisingly effective action movie.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Toby Howard (Chris Pine) and Tanner Howard (Ben Foster) can't make ends meet and they're at the end of their rope. The movie begins with a small Texas Midland Bank opening. One of the tellers Elsie (Dale Dickey) has come in early and unfortunately is the only one in the bank when 2 guys in ski-masks burst in. They demand the cash from the teller drawers, only small bills. Elsie tells them she doesn't have access until the manager shows up. They wait and wrangle the manager into helping them. He starts to protest but gets hit for it. The bank robbers manage to get away and speed toward the next town. Toby blasts Tanner for being unnecessarily forceful but it's pretty obvious that one of them is in it to raise the capital and one of them is in it for the thrills.They're able to successfully rob a second and then surprisingly a third before they head home to dispose of the getaway car. We then start to get a peek into Toby and Tanner's life. Toby lives one his mother's ranch (she passed away after battling a long-suffering illness) and Tanner has only gotten out of jail a year ago. They have resorted to robbing banks to pay off a reverse mortgage on the property so Toby can leave it to his kids. Both of them seem to have made peace with the fact that they probably won't get away. Their case has been handed off to the Texas Rangers and a pair of Rangers Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto (Gil Birmingham) are assigned to it. Marcus is about to retire and wants one last shot at glory before he gives up his badge and gun.Hell or High Water has it's own distinctive flavour. The movie radiates Texas in all it's glory. I don't just mean in the prettier aspects either. Even coming from someone who has never been to Texas, this is what you picture Texas looking like. Small one-horse towns dot the landscape and while the residents of those towns seem content, the outsiders (the Texas Rangers) take pity on them. Hell or High Water has an authentic country feel and I would add that even though a lot of what is being shown isn't pretty, the cinematography beautiful too look at. It reminded me a lot of Sicario, which is interesting because this was written by the same writer of Sicario.My favourite thing about Hell or High Water was the strong relationships between the characters. Through Chris and Ben's performances and the strongly written script, you really latch on to Tanner and Toby. They have a deep bond as brothers despite the fact they're very different people. You root for them to make it out because they're underdogs up against the system, they have a righteous cause, they've just been forced to do what they're doing because of the unfairness of the system. You also grow to really like Marcus and Alberto. They have no problem laying into each other but they work well together. A lot of their teasing each other is racial humour but it's not meant in a truly racist way, they're just like any pair of old friends who know how to get under each others skin. It can be hard to get you to like characters on both sides of the situation but it's so key to why Hell or High Water works.When it comes to the cast, you have a couple people well cast into roles they've similarly done before and a couple of surprises. This is a different type of character for Chris Pine, the only time I've seen him do something similar was Z for Zachariah. He's a better actor than he's given credit for, he slips into Toby completely. Ben Foster was also great, I like him best when he's playing more unhinged characters. Jeff Bridges was doing his Texas drawl, he's also a really good actor but he was also really hard to understand at points. Gil Birmingham was pretty poignant as Alberto, he's funny when he's playing off Bridges but he also delivers a good monologue in the middle of the movie.The movie delivers in the end too, I got a lot more action than I bargained for and it was suitably grounded and gritty like the rest of the movie. I really liked the ending, there's a classic western standoff at the end of the movie. Pairing that with the sharp dialogue, it made for a great wrap-up.The movie that I would compare this to would be The Town. Both centre of blue collar protagonists, one represents the brains and the other has the devil-may-care attitude. They also show the other side of the coin, presenting intense yet likable cops who are just trying to get their job done. I still like The Town better but they're both great entries in this genre. I thought Hell or High Water lived up to the hype, I'd give it an 8.5/10. I won't round it up to 9 though, it's really good but it may or may not make my 2016 top 10."
" 'Starred up' about this film
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,9,"What a great film, I absolutely loved it.The makings of a top quality film are how much you just sit there and enjoy it without getting distracted - a film that was as good, if not better, than No Country For Old Men - what a wonderful surprise, and the best film I've seen in several months.With its sense of humour, subtlety, beauty, easy-listening music and very likable characters, and its excellent plot - a nothing of a film at first that went full circle and became very much something - I'd say it's easily one of the best films of 2016.And this is the first time a director has taken Ben Foster's on-screen madness and turned it into something endearing and likable, instead of the crazy loon Ben Foster usually plays in films like Alpha Dog and 30 Days of Night. And the rest of the cast is impeccable, and I didn't even recognise 'Captain Kirk' until I checked the credits at the end.What a wonderful piece of entertainment. I went to bed with a big smile of satisfaction on my face after watching this film."
