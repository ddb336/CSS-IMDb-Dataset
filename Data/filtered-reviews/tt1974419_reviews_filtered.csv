" Bizarre and refreshing
",2021-03-29 00:00:00,8,Will you understand this film? Probably not. Just like donnie darko it is very weird and alien in its delivery but full of incredible art and acting. Music is fantastic too. Sexy and terrifying.
" Conceptual, maybe a tad snobbish
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,5,"I would give this 5.5 if I could. I can see where the director wanted to go, but he just didn't get there. The performances were wooden, but I think that is what the director wanted. The cinematography was stunning...it was a visual treat for the eyes, like a moving art masterpiece. But in the end, it neither added up to anything you could sink your teeth into, nor elicited any empathy within the viewer. A miss, but worth seeing if you are bored."
" This movie has the same depth as all the wh1t3 models in it: NONE
",2021-03-24 00:00:00,5,"It has an amazing aesthetic, but it's too flamboyant and has a simple concept (a message about the toxicity of the modelling/fashion industry). At some point, it gets boring."
" Mesmerizing!
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,10,Incredible visual telling of the story!One of my absolute favourites!
" Purposefully Polarizing
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,6,"As a fan of Nicolas Winding Refn's most ""beloved"" works (Drive, Bronson) and what many see as his worst (Only God Forgives), I would say that The Neon Demon matches his stunning (colorblind) eye for lighting and cinematography while in some ways tempering his tendency toward visceral brutality, replacing it with disturbing, ""maneater"" psycho-sexuality. The film follows a young model (Elle Fanning) whose natural beauty stuns the modeling world, quickly turning a makeup artist (Jena Malone) and two beauty-obsessed models (Bella Heathcote, Abbey Lee Kershaw) into obsessive lust and jealousy.As with Only God Forgives before it, the film uses symbolism and unspoken implication to create its allusions, which in this case seem to highlight the illusion of beauty and the obsessive fantasies created to either fake it or make it. However, much of this gets lost in the sparseness of the material and in the symbolism that doesn't immediately connect to the themes Refn is conveying to the viewer. With an underdeveloped narrative, the film has a brooding underbelly that never brings us too far under the surface. Despite a charming Karl Glusman, a sinister Keanu Reeves, an eerie Desmond Harrington and a pretentious Alessandro Nivola in supporting roles, the film is very thin on story and character development undercutting the power its four main female characters could have. With things moving too quickly to their conclusion, the film never truly realizes the promise of its exploration of a beauty-obsessed industry full of Lady Macbeth types.So while it may rejuvenate Refn's standing following Only God Forgives, it doesn't move him far away from the perception of Refn being pretentiously visual while lacking substance or immediacy. This perception was created by Valhalla Rising and Only God Forgives in quite possibly an unfair manner. Nevertheless, there is enough here to satisfy the niche audience of Refn fans who enjoy his violent surrealism. However, there won't be much for audiences outside of that niche to consume... if you excuse the pun."
" There's no theme
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,1,I really didn't understand what this movie is all about. Its just so boring couldn't watch it till the end. All i have seen was this pretty girl hanging around with her constantly unhappy face and its all just nonesense
" Self-indulgent and pretentious trash.
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,1,"Anyone claiming this movie is some relevatory piece of art just wants to feel smart for liking something that they can claim other people don't understand. It's boring trash with pretty people staring half asleep at a camera for two hours because it's ""deep"" and offers nothing new. Throw in some visuals Under the Skin did way better and some played out music with a bit of necrophilia and you get this streaming pile. I'm sorry I ever watched this film. Want something that does the subject better, go watch Starry Eyes. Want something with crazy visuals that demands the viewers attention, but is good, go watch Mandy. Avoid this film."
" Did I just watch an art house film?
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,9,"Did I just watch an art house film? I guess so but, wow this was an unreal experience!The Neon Demon doesn't function through a thick story line, sad characters or through heavy gore scenes. It's the eery atmosphere it creates and especially the outstanding visual presentation what makes it unique. I highly recommend watching this in a complete dark room to be fully able to perceive its dark and sinister beauty.The Neon Demon tells the story of Jesse who is a - I guess 19? - years old cute, shy girl who left her hometown to start a photo model career. Her fragility and innocence make her to be perceived like an angel in a potentially hostile world. This is one way of how the movie creates a contrast to set up several suspenseful moments:Just by rooting for the girl and hoping that nothing evil happens to her put me under high tension. Additional contrast is created by the interaction between Jesse and her environment: I even doubted something good can actually be good, like when she says something positive about a person, although there was no open reason given at all to think so. My feelings were really ambiguous. I guess that's called (a form of) suspense and at least it worked for me.Jesse's story is told in a rather slow way throughout the movie. Although it offers a great character development don't think about The Neon Demon as a slow-burning drama or even a feel-good movie. I mentioned that it doesn't do its trick by graphic gore scenes, but this flick is not recommended for the faint-hearted and a few very gross scenes exist.It touches several different taboo topics!By touches I mean that it makes you aware of the moral boundaries every sane person has about various topics. With these borders called to mind it creates pictures in advance where the border crossing only takes place in your own mind. It often creates terror solely by playing with the uncertainty if something injected into your mind will actually happen or not. No spoiler, but some things (beyond the border) will actually happen! This creates a real horror feeling and it worked better for me than the usual gore fest type of movie.Expect an artistic, dark, twisted and even sick horror movie which culminates in its last third and finale. Personally, it left me speechless about what I have seen in the last hour when the credits rolled.The Neon Demon is a masterpiece and not just a movie but an audio-visual experience. ""Enjoy!""Thanks for reading."
" Let's Do Lunch? Horror!
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,10,"""Neon Demon,"" (2016). Elle Fanning, Christina Hendricks. Directed by Nicholas Winding Refn.
This film uses the Last Supper allusion to depict the Sacrificial Lamb/ Transubstantiation metamorphosis of the Christ Figure. As with most aberrant psychological disorders, this film about the effects of all consuming, malignant jealousy fits nicely into the horror genre. The setting is the Los Angeles model scene. Of all the horror symbolism which pervades the scenes, the unusual reliance neon lighting is used evoke eerie feelings and rarified state or unnaturalness. Extreme beauty in juxtaposition to the less beautiful seems to cause malignant narcissistic cannibalism. The cannibalism manifests itself in a most peculiar way. Normally less beautiful girls will attach themselves to a beautiful girl as if proximity will ensure that some benefit will rub off on them, as in surplus males and spill over. But in malignant jealousy, the envious one becomes homicidal. It works this way. The psycho will insinuate herself into every aspect of the life of the object of her desire. She will almost insert herself into the private regions as if if she remains long enough, she can work her way up from the inside and look out of her host's eyes, thus becoming the host and no longer feeling jealousy because she will own what the besutiful woman has. In the film this phenomenon is shown in eating, ingesting, digesting, and consuming imagery. Males do the same thing. Keenau's slipping into Jesse's room while she is sleeping and slipping a knife between her lips suggests that his purpose is to destroy the beauty that he feels he cannot have, his jealousy reflecting eating or consuming imagery. These are the types of men who maim women or kill them. They are often cruel or denigrating to a beautiful woman for no conceivable reason. No pun intended. The lion lying in wait in Jesse's bedroom symbolizes danger lurking in predators whose purpose is to rid themselves of competition. It is strange that Jesse's instincts kick in and she manages to sidestep death at that time. But because she is young, she naively allows herself to be backed into an irretrievable position at the pool. What, one wonders, is the reason that a sixteen-year-old girl is alone in the world, suseptible to the dangers of a cut-throat industry in LA? Usually, runaways were chased away. By something. From something. They become statistics. LA is full of them. This is a well done film. Superb script direction, action, lighting, art production. I give it 5 of 5 stars. Enjoy!"
" Gorgeous cinematography/music/editing
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,9,Simply one of the best looking films of the past few years. It was nothing like I expected in terms of story and I loved it for that. It keeps you thinking about it for days after.
" Very ""colourful"" in a dark world!
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,7,"The Neon Demon*...If you like dark sets and polarising effects with haunting synthesised music then you may like this... Then there's the storyline...I won't ruin it if you haven't seen it, but it is full of metaphors and subliminal messages within the fashion industry and of wanting; beauty and perfection; a naive innocence that allows themself to be caught up in a world of narcissistic traits and devoured by your own beauty and by the hatred and jealousy of others!It's about coming of age, the unimportance of men and the fear and loathing of making it in an industry of wolves and a world of monsters!One of those movies that leaves you bewildered after seeing it, but over analysing it due to the wonder of what you have just seen.It would make a good book!*(Not for the faint hearted; perfect for an open minded critic who likes a euphemistic, thriller)"
" DONT WATCH IT
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,1,"The worst movie! It has the lamest plot twist! And the only good part, is the acting"
" This director is consistent
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,7,All his movies are very similar in style but also unique in their own way. This movie is solid. Very good atmosphere and acting. Just disturbing enough to make it interesting too.
" Don't watch this!!!!
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,1,"The worst movie ever, don't even bother to watch this"
" A 10 minute morality play inside a 2 hour movie
",2020-12-05 00:00:00,2,"This has an incredible cast and the director has had previously well-done films, this is crap on toast.
Boring, slow, and eminently forgettable. Chekov's gun lying all over the floor, unshot. We sympathize with Elle Fanning until we don't. Keanu Reeves seems to have been in a more interesting movie, but these were the outtakes for that movie and they just crammed them in here to add a big name. He's irrelevant to the story. Jena Malone is given little to do but be weird and a little offputting. We learn more late in the movie, but in a very ""what's the wackiest thing I can get Jena Malone to do on camera?"" sort of way, not by means of anything grounded in the character.
Bella Heathcote and the one who isn't Bella Heathcote are fine, if interchangeable, which I suppose is part of the point.
The fashion industry in the movie is run exactly the way that you would expect the fashion industry of Tupelo, MS to be run. 1 agent, 3 models, 1 photographer, 1 makeup artist (who doubles as the makeup artist at the local mortuary in her free time).
A good portion of the movie has the camera fixed on bored-looking beautiful people fidgeting while stereotypically ""eerie"" music plays. It's supposed to be dramatic tension, but it's the same way that watching paint dry is dramatic.
If you've got a couple of hours and like to watch pretty people not actually do anything for the first hour and a half, then do some stuff because the plot demands it and they did sign up to be in a horror movie, after all, this is for you. If you like to see motivated characters and a horror movie that is actually suspenseful, maybe not."
" Pure Bile, Plus a Few Other Disturbing Bodily Functions
",2020-11-17 00:00:00,2,"Imagine staring at a blank, dark wall and watching it for, say, 22 minutes. Nothing happens, but you keep staring. Imagine further slowing it all down to quarter speed. Now you have 88 minutes of - not a thing. Yet for some reason you cant turn away, even when that reason is a total mystery to you. Of course, if youre into the macabre, the stomach turning dreck purely for shock value, hang on past those first 88. This may be for you.You can try to dig into the surreal, for a message in the symbolism, through all the atmospheric layouts where they tried so hard in the relentless meandering to find a message worth holding onto. Dig deep, deeper. It isnt there.There are no characters to hold onto in this one, no dialogue worth remembering, next to no character development. It didnt matter enough to the scriptwriter{s} or director to bother. Its all a ""nothing is something"" nearly 2 hour attempt at slo-mo MTV style visual eye candy. But this candy is ultra sour, and the after taste will take a long time to get out of your mouth - and head.Maybe the only message worth saving here is that the modeling industry - and entertainment industry in general - are saturated with sleazy dirt bags with vacant stares and empty souls. From the first moment you step into it, its all about what they can gain from you, until they suck you dry and leave you for dust. Its really telling that films of this type are made regularly, but everyone is in self-denial that they are one of the sleaze bags responsible for the aftermath. The truth is, like with this film, you'd be wise to stay far away. But if you find anything resembling entertainment value in this mess, God help you."
" Visually disturbing descent into an abyss of beauty and envy
",2020-11-13 00:00:00,7,"""The Neon Demon"" is a 2016 horror thriller directed by Nicolas Winding Refn starring Elle Fanning and Jena Malone.
⚪
All in all, this dazzling Nicolas Winding Refn feature captivatingly parades on a gloomy catwalk of beau ideals, obsession with slenderness and unadulterated envy, and even if there are some weaknesses concerning pace and plot, the bizarrely hypnotic imagery, taciturn but distinct performances and an indescribably unnerving score make for a subliminally ruthless and subtly disturbing, fluorescent fever dream that impressively and radically exposes the mercilessness and perfidy of being a glamorous model.
⚪
After many of my fellow cinephiles have told me that this NWR is slightly underrated and didn't deserve any of the hate it has received from critics, I thought that it was a must watch for me. Honestly, I didn't know what I was in for. All I knew was that the director of the brilliantly cruising drama ""Drive"" directed Elle Fanning in a bizarre thriller about models and fashion. Basically, that's the gist of the film, but how it was executed was what had an impact on me. Once again, I can comprehend why one might dislike it, because the Danish director's style is anything but ordinary, and only when you can appreciate it, you will find a gem with this film. Yes, it is absolutely unconventional, and this concept shows itself in all facets of this odd feature. First of all, I would like to point out Elle Fanning who scintillates in one of her first leading roles. At the age of only sixteen (yes, when shooting started she was underaged!), she managed to capture the vulnerability, insecurity and innocence of her character extremely convincingly, and it is her who, in fact, carries most of the film with her performance. She plays the juvenile Jesse who tries to become a fashion model, and, thanks to her often-referred natural beauty, eventually manages to get into the business, what, of course, inadvertently makes her make enemies. Well, what admittedly sounds like a generic reality TV show ends up being a distressing nightmare. What else did you expect from the dude who made ""Drive""? Light fare? As the tag line on many advertisements state, beauty is the only thing, and the film follows this premise in one of the most disturbing and ominous ways possible. Gradually, Jesse succeeds in the business and is more and more consumed by vanity, egoism and arrogance, and the shy little girl from the beginning is gone completely in the end. And I mean, literally. It wouldn't be a work of NWR if it wasn't grotesque, but before I'll talk about the outrageous final act, I want to point out the equally dark undertones preceding it as well. As you might have noticed, I have purposely remarked on several occasions that Jesse is merely sixteen years old. You may ask why, and I am going to tell you: In many scenes the young girl is exposed to misconduct of all kinds. From her best friend who tries to hit on her, over a photographer who forces her to undress in order to lubricate her with golden paint, to a make-up artist trying to rape her, there is all, including Keanu Reeves as a shady motel owner who contributes a little perversity as well. I for one was shocked to see that Refn in fact depicted all those scenes despite the actor and the character being a minor, but then I came to the conclusion that it is not even as unworldly as I thought. I might not have been a model myself (wait, I have been once, but I was a kid), but I know how hideous and unpredictable humans can be. The real world is merciless and hard-hearted, especially to young women. That's why I thought that the scandalous things depicted in here are as shocking as they are realistic, and that wasn't even all. Right under the surface of this apparently shallow film seethes a callous conflict, and how Refn does criticise the business deserves major respect. Almost casually, by short and rushed lines of dialogue, he subliminally expresses his extreme criticism on the entire industry. When a perverse photographer touches a minor, a company chef fires a candidate without looking at her or when an opponent model proudly brags about her plastic surgery, there is this intense feeling of disgust, and its always palpable. By the example of Jesse, he wants to show the severe conflict of ""natural beauty vs. artificial beauty"" and how the two extremes act accordingly. As she is becoming more and more successful, the protagonist falls for egotism, and the once humble girl turns into an condescending little princess. The curious thing about this film is how this development takes place, and that is how I also come to my first point of criticism. There is zero to little dialogue in this film, and the intensity is primarily carried by its disturbing and bizarre imagery, and even if it is possible that a film can in fact succeed doing this (see ""Portrait Of A Lady On Fire"") it is a risky thing to do. This one here is not always on point, and the inconsistency amazes me. Many sequences are exciting yet bland, impressive yet unimposing, vacuous yet meaningful. You know what I mean? At the same time, I grasp what he wants to state and have no clue about what he wants to tell me. It showcases raw emotions, feelings and simultaneously it keeps its distance which in turn keeps me from finding a deep connection to both the characters or the story. There is a certain intensity this film causes, but I wonder how it would have haunted me even more if it had been, in fact, closer. You know what I mean? Well, therefore the final act compensated this feeling, because it is downright shocking! True to the motto ""pride comes before a fall"" Jesse pays the price for her arrogance by, well, falling. As if the necrophilia depicted before wasn't dreadful enough, cannibalism comes into the play as well. After she has neglected or outdone them, her former friend and two peers decide to kill her ... and then eat her and bath in her blood as well. I was like ""What in the actual hell?"" only to be reminded that it just perfectly rounds up the alleged exaggeratedness Refn accuses the industry of. And in the final scene, when one of the cannibalistic models throws up Jesse's undigested eye and kills herself, and her friend picks up and eats it without batting an eye, the preposterousness has reached its climax. Before you are able to ask questions, the credits roll and leave you completely disgusted and shattered. In the end, it is one of those odd, crazy and unusual films that were never meant to be mainstream films. It is pure independent cinema and definitely not everyone's pair of shoes, but what did you expect from Nicolas Winding Refn? I for one was able to find a liking to this unconventional work, and even if it has its obvious flaws, it left a severe impact on me."
" Disappointing, but worth a watch
",2020-11-09 00:00:00,6,"I was expecting this to be more like Only God Forgives (which despite its negative reception, is a movie I really like), so I was a bit disappointed by how (mostly) straightforward it was in comparison.I also think it might've gone a bit too far in its attempts to shock the audience. Drive and Only God Forgives had violence, but they didn't have... that.
(I did really like the ending though)What makes this movie work for me though are its beautiful visuals and its shock factor, which as I said, can go too far, but I really respect when a director dares to put stuff like this on the screen, even if it makes me want to unsee the whole thing.Its criticism of the beauty industry is clear, but it really works better on a pure audiovisual level.I may not enjoy it as much as Nicolas Winding Refn's two previous films, but I definitely see a lot of appeal for fans of the beautiful and the messed up.Also, Keanu Reeves plays really againts type and he's suprisingly really great at it."
" Artistic miss
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,5,"Though artistic, its lack of a cohesive narrative makes the suspense sometimes hard to follow leaving the ending sudden and brutal. This would've made for an interesting anime, the media could handle the concept better."
" Refns Worst
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"Takes way too long to make an obvious, unoriginal statement, and does so with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Watch Bronson, Drive, or Pusher instead."
" Style and Little Substance
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,7,"A young model moves to L.A. and is instantly preyed upon by almost everyone she comes into contact with, but some of them might have a very specific and sinister reason why they want to get close to her.The Neon Demon is a perfect example of style over substance. We know next to nothing about these characters, which makes them feel like nameless fairy tale characters drawn in broad brush strokes. By the time the film gets to the real horror elements of the film, it's almost over and that's a shame. It's still worth a watch just for the pretty images, insane finale, and dreamy synth score."
" Stunningly Beautiful
",2020-10-22 00:00:00,6,"They say film is a visual medium and that's true, but many people also forget that these visual stories need to be populated by interesting characters and well written scenes. The script of The Neon Demon is a total afterthought and it's all about the visuals. It works better in some scenes than it does in others, but it's always a film where you can't take your eyes off the screen. It's almost hypnotic that way with its brightly colored lighting, sets, and dreamy electronic score. It's not a movie that has a lot to say, but it's still a film worth experiencing."
" Flimsy models, skinny story
",2020-10-20 00:00:00,6,Flimsy story. Beautiful cinematography. Skinny models. Poor dialogues. Great soundtrack. Wouldn't recommend.

" Don't waste your time
",2020-10-06 00:00:00,1,Terrible and empty. If you value your time then skip this one. Not worth it
" Medicore thriller
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,4,"There's nothing really novel or interesting about this movie. It's your basic vampire movie.But because it's got a lot of hot women telling other hot women that they're not that hot, and generally obsessing over their bodies (with some help from the men, too), it's got a pseudo-feminist ""message"" that will instantly add two stars to the reviews of anyone who purports to be ""progressive.""To be fair, the movie is beautifully shot with some amazing use of color and light. Many of the shots do look like fashion photos, which, I'm sure, is intentional.Elle Fanning, though absolutely stunning here, largely sleepwalks through her role, maintaining the deer-in-the-headlights look that's commented upon early in the film.Jenna Malone is interesting and appealing as Ruby, but telegraphs the fact that she's a baddie pretty much from the get-go.Keanu Reeves has a very small role as a sleazy motel manager that had me scratching my head. Did he love the script so much that he was willing to take that crumb of a role? Or maybe he just wanted to pick up some pocket money while he was filming ""Bill and Ted Face the Music."" What up, Keanu?Anyway, after watching some genuinely creative films recently just as ""Visitor Q"" and ""I Am Not a Serial Killer"" this just left me bored. I'm sure some people will call it a ""scathing indictment of the fashion industry"" or Hollywood, but at this point, after so many films like this, it just falls flat. If all of these actors, writers, and directors hate Hollywood so much, why don't they find another line of work?"
" Visually striking, nothing more.
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,1,"This ""art house"" film is difficult to describe without giving away the whole thing. The vivid colors and contrasts are appealing, but for me it ends there. The plot is thinly veiled and the story could have been told within a 30 minute TV episode. It drags for over an hour before it gets to the little bit of story.This movie just doesn't have ANY elements of humanity or value. It is pretentious and almost condescending to watch, as if trying to be coy and sneaky. There's nothing remotely erotic in the film. It's uncomfortable to watch such a story develop around a sixteen year-old girl, and it's just not entertaining. There are some good actors on screen, but this movie is far below their abilities. IMHO this movie shouldn't have ever been made."
" Stunning visuals, disturbing substance
",2020-09-23 00:00:00,6,"Having seen previous films by Nicolas Winding Refn and consider Drive to be a masterpiece, had little expectations for this film. There is certainly some influences within Drive in the Neon Demon but this film is closer to Only God Forgives in terms of quality.Now his films are certain art house pieces and we can see as to why many people would dislike this film. It is most certainly for an acquired taste and not for everyone.As the film, well done visuals and the camera angles and set pieces are nice to look at but after a while the story line becomes predictable and cliche. There are some intrigue at first then suddenly flares off a little. There are certainly several bizarre and more disturbing scenes towards the end which stand out.This film isn't perfect, yet isn't completely awful. It is a step up from OGF but not on the level of Drive."
" terrible-don't waste your time

" Skin Deep
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,7,"Elle Fanning is Jesse. Jesse is a model. The other girls would kill to have her looks. Well, that's essentially the premise of The Neon Demon. A gory psychological thriller by Nicolas Winding Refn. It's an allegory for the vein, selfish world of modeling. At times, it's a bit too on the nose, but that's got to be the point. It's hard to know whether or not this film is relevant now, or if it will be in 10 years. America's perception of beauty is ever changing. As a horror film, many people were taken aback by it's disturbing nature and visual grotesque, but I'm pretty sure Ari Aster has this beat. As with most Refn films, dialogue is not the strength. The characters are stunningly vapid, yet in the world of modeling, that fits like a glove. You'll enjoy the film on a superficial level, certainly. Even the grossest scenes are delivered by an expert hand in cinematography and editing. Whether or not you find this film to be genius or junk depends on the person, but make sure you are in earshot of a shower."
" Sizzle no steak
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,1,"Vacuous stew of light and sound, zero calories. The electronic music was kind of cool and lotsa visual tricks but otherwise zilch"
" The modelling industry is bad. Do you get it?
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,4,"Felt like Refn sat next to me the entire film asking me in my ear ""do you get it?"" after every scene. A gross and boring, misogynistic look at an industry they hired two of their actors from, coupled with a bland dry soundtrack desperately trying to recapture the magic of drive. All of the bizarre and unsettling scenes though visually interesting appear from nowhere and seemingly without point of meaning. There is no real point to watch this movie apart from some nice shots."
" Refn is litmus paper for terrible taste in film
",2020-08-13 00:00:00,2,"After years of poser-acclaimed duds, Refn has finally found the perfect subject matter for one of his films. Garishly lit meat locker nightclubs...silent stares full of malice that go on for way too long...planks of wood trying to pass for actors...mannequins trying to pass for human characters...lack of any substance whatsoever behind endless gloss - holy carp, it's the world of professional modeling! The hallmark elements that make every Refn film since Valhalla Rising a glistening turdpile are, in this case, a logical and near-perfect fit. So meta!Unfortunately, even with zero expectations - both for Refn as a filmmaker and for models as a class of humans - this film is still a dud. Whatever rudimentary storyline the film worked so hard to deep fry in lush, neon-lit atmosphere is completely squandered in the final act. The film had considerable leeway and budget to go pretty much anywhere - and it chose to walk into a brick wall, then a lamppost, then trip over a bench, then soil itself with a big wet fart as the credits roll. There is no payoff in terms of character or plot development. There is no extravagant spectacle to writhe and pulse with the energy of a climax. No mysteries are unraveled - or, for that matter, introduced. There's just a cinematic equivalent of Refn poking you in the ribs, saying ""lookee, I made a film about human nature...get it?!"" Yeah buddy, we sure do. The worst part is that the film did this thinking it's clever and uncompromising because, uh, symbolism...? But a computer algorithm approximation of an unremarkable grade schooler could dredge up better metaphors from the void of its existence.So definitely not his worst - for instance, it's not a blatant uncredited ripoff of another film like Drive was (that film being The Driver with Bruce Dern, which is in itself a remake of a Melville film with the added value of awesome 70s-era car stunts) - but a chocolate-glazed turd with cinnamon and whipped cream is still a turd. Bite at your own risk.And if you hear anyone praising this or any other Refn film (exempting the Pusher trilogy), you know exactly what their mouth is full of."
" Glamorously Distasteful
",2020-08-11 00:00:00,4,"This film will have you questioning WHY you continue to watch it.
It is an art film; full of luxurious scenes and lovely people whom have minimal words and minimal personalities.
The acting is steady and you get a dash of Keanu Reeves, so that's a plus. Elle Fanning has substantial presence in this film, but it might bother you that she was only 16 years old in this film which (when you think about some of the scenes with and without her in them) is pretty creepy. She wasn't couldn't even watch this film when it came out due to her age at the time.
I love the highly artistic visuals, but then it starts to slip more and more into the horror that it says it contains. It becomes a glamorous disturbance in excess. Some scenes I had to turn away from. The movie takes on perversion, increased coldness and is also like watching Elizabeth Báthory (an actual, historical psycho) and Jeffrey Dahmer, but with models.
Watch this at your own risk. Yikes."

" slow burner
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,6,"VERY slow burner!
Starting with something that I'm sure everyone will agree, the photography is very interesting and beautiful.
It surprised me how consistent, clear and straight forward it started, I liked how it was easy to follow but at the same time it was creating an atmosphere of tension that kept me curious on what was going to happen, even though it was quite obvious, it still kept my attention through the two first thirds of the movie.
But then it kind of lost the grip and deranged into a psychedelic trip, which can be interesting sometimes, but it felt a bit out of place here, like there was a massive change of idea and style towards the end.
I don't think it's bad at all, but it made me feel like the last third belonged to another movie, with another concept.
Still, interesting movie, with great visuals and good acting."
" Had potential
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,5,Beautifully shot but just fell short. Don't waste your time on this.
" Okay?
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,5,"I've got an hour left of this movie and I'm really fighting the urge to turn this off. God I hate movies like this, reminds me of Only God Forgives with Ryan Reynolds. Hey look at me I look kind of visually stunning but the main character barley says a single word for 2 hours.I really can't stand films like this. In what world is this movie a horror movie? There's just no context.. like okay the fashion world is awful for women but this film I dunno, 5/10 is me being generous aswell."
" Well.

" The Beautiful, The Innocent and The Narcissistic
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,7,"😱 First Impressions:
The name itself already lured me in and it actually bears more meaning than initially thought. Firstly, a literal one involving the style and design of the film. The other has to do with a metaphor; centred on narcissistic tendencies.Pros:
😋 Beautiful even surreal use of colors and symbolism in cinematography😋 Elle Fanning is a perfect fit for the inexperienced, timid and ultimately easily impressionable aspiring model.😋 Soundtrack bodes well with the overall trippy experienceCons:
😪 The same imagery could be jarring and too slow-burn for some.😪 Under-developed characters.😪 Story could have headed in a better direction; instead of a grim albeit possibly true depiction of a cutthroat industry.😇Verdict😈
The Neon Demon presents an equally stylistic and ambitious exploration of the modelling scene- though one that does not pay off or lead anywhere groundbreaking. That said, it is still a worthy 2-hour long psychological horror that's unlike any other, not for a long while."
" Morbid beauty
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,6,"The beauty in this movie is limited to external beauty. It also mentions inner beauty in a small part. The plot focuses on the morbid behavior of pursuing external beauty. The psychedelic electronic music, the slightly horrifying and suspicious bass electronics and the regular rhythm moments render the distorted human nature and narcissism in the fashion world very well."
" Not good
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,2,"Style over substance aren't my favorite movies and this one I really dislike. The dialogue is just awful and it all came pretentious, the story is so stretched like it all could just play in the first 30 minutes because we already knew what would happen... I just got bored after 10 minutes. The movies looks good visually but that honestly didn't matter to me. The movie themes aren't subtle at all and yeah we got the point from the first 10 minutes and then that point just kept going and going without anything new to add."
" We're So Pretty...Vacant.
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,6,"This film is cold. The visuals are stark, yet dazzling. The soundtrack is ominous, yet dreamy. The story takes place in a landscape of desperation. The characters are vacant and emotionless. Refn has captured his vision of a bleak lifestyle very well. The Neon Demon is great to look at, as well. A strange film. Worth a watch. You'll connect with none of the characters...which, I believe, is the point."
" First-class pictures and fourth-class stories.
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,6,Lots of great viewing scenes. but the story was so weird. very interesting but slow movie
" A fever dream that will haunt you for days.
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,8,"Moody, surreal, obtuse. If you like Nicolas Winding Refn's recent opus such as Valhalla Rising and Drive, you will also like The Neon Demon. In signature Refn fashion, he tiptoes the line between thriller and art-school thesis, this time appropriating the high-gloss sheen and shallowness of the L.A. fashion scene in both subject and structure. It plays like a fever dream. It feels like waking up when the credits roll. It will haunt you for days."
" ""Artistic"" movies should come with a ""probably sucks"" warning
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,2,"This movie may have been good if they took out all the long pauses. Like if it was a half hour, I'd say watch it. But alas it's not. What it is, is a long boring window into the life of jealous models. With a payoff that wasn't worth sitting through the whole thing."
" Poor acting, awful script, nice visuals
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,5,Undoubtedly Refn's worst film yet. Couldn't tell if the script was just awful or the acting was so atrocious it made the script seem awful. The second half of the film had some visually interesting scenes but on the whole the film would have been better if it had no dialogue at all.
" Pointless
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,1,Whatever was going on in Winding Refn's mind definitely did not hit the screen coherently. Ok it looked good at time's but really it's a pretentious mess. Save your eyeballs.
" not even stylish enough to say 'style over substance'
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,1,"Absolutely one of the worst films I've ever seen. I suppose, objectively, something does happen, but it doesn't feel like it does: at least, it doesn't feel like it matters. Everything is so distant and detached. Terrible."
" What a waste of time
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,2,"Great visuals

Yup

" Worst Movie of my life
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,1,I had to see this Movie for school and I still feel traumatised even after a year. I think the director wanted to shock the audience and he definitely did but he did nothing more. I would never recommend this Movie to anyone.
" Surreal Horror
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,9,I've read other reviews saying neon demon had no substance. This film is for those who know how to look deep for substance. This film is not straight horror. It is artistic horror. I enjoy both straight horror & weird thrills. Neon Demon is surreal art in its vibrant colors and dazzling images & the acting is not straight up either. It is strange & great. I loved this movie & imagine enjoying it for years to come.
" Worst movie ever
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,1,I had to see this movie for a school project and I still regret not calling in sick that day. It was a horrible movie without any point.
" An Unsettling Metaphor for LA and the Fashion Industry
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,7,"This film is not for everyone (nor should any film be), but it is widely misunderstood. It resides in the singular vein of auteur art house films such as Suspiria (1977) and Under the Skin (2013). The Neon Demon is rife with hidden symbolism, and the title itself is left open for interpretation... A seductive and alluring entity that ultimately devours and destroys. It could represent the fashion industry, self-obsession, our cultural infatuation with youth and beauty, the LA scene, or even fame in general.The audience follows 16 year-old Jesse (Elle Fanning), who arrives in LA with aspirations of modeling and is befriended by make-up artist Ruby (Jena Malone). The film walks our naive protagonist through the typical baptism of the LA culture and lifestyle: meeting people with hidden motives, the predatory nature of powerful men, how we manipulate to use others, and facades of friendless which mask fear and jealousy. Even the opening club scene - with its flashing lights and quick editing that draws Jesse slowly forward - represents the hypnotic and seductive nature of the high-life in Tinseltown.The theme of beauty heavily pervades this film, and writer/director Nicolas Winding Refn leaves every frame dripping with style. It is an unquestioningly gorgeous film, and even the final credit sequence's typography and visuals are beautiful works of art. It's hammered home that beauty isn't everything... it's the only thing. It's nature and value is routinely debated, focused on the perfect and natural. Jesse's peers/rivals include the surgically plasticized Gigi (Bella Heathcote), who represents the idea of 'manufactured' beauty, and beautiful but established Sarah (former Victoria Secret model Abbey Lee), who represents the unreasonable expiration date of high-fashion modeling.If thematic concepts of narcissism, backstabbing, crushing loneliness, and the dog-eat-dog nature of highly-competitive yet shallow industries aren't horrific enough... there's plenty of Pagan imagery, implied witchcraft, and reference to Elizabeth Báthory (the most prolific female murderer in history). The first two acts play on psychological fears and societal mind-games, while the third act calcifies the film's horrific tone, with some genuinely disturbing scenes including necrophilia and cannibalism.Ultimately - like its characters - the film helps determine who is able to stomach what is necessary to 'make it' and who can't. If you're dreaming of being an actor or model, consider this film a beautiful prism that examines the price of success."
" Terrifying
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,10,"The Neon Demon is one of the scariest films of recent memory. It's a horrifying satirical depiction of the modern world and the social implications of true physical beauty; something few will ever experience.We live in a very aesthetic obsessed world. Movies, TV, Tabloids, Instagram. It's all the same business; looking pretty on camera. The average citizen sees attractive people on tv, people who live higher and larger just because they're easy on the eyes.The current time is a very body positive era but deep down, we all hate the fact that we aren't perfect. Nobody is. The pictures you see on the cover pages of magazines and all over social media are just ""photoshopped"" images of people who are really just as insecure as the rest of us. But if that's true, what would happen if a such perfect being were to exist? Enter ""The Neon Demon"".Drive (2011) director Nicolas Winding Refn provides a hyper stylized slow burn masterpiece built on top of strong, sound and consistent themes of jealousy, duality, and raw human nature. Truly terrifying psychological horror at its finest."
" Pretentious Pablum
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,3,"I like most of Refn's work. This film started great. Unfortunately it devolves into over the top pretentious trash. It's too bad, as he is much more talented than this. Do yourself a favor and skip it."
" Neither Horror nor Thriller !
",2020-03-22 00:00:00,2,"The movie doesn't have anything to say !
Horror ? No, absolutly it is not a horror movie !
Thriller ? No, tom and jerry is more exciting than this movie !"
" Good work
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,7,"The Neon Demon is a lot of things. Transcendent, hypnotic, and stylish are a few words that come to mind. This film had me hooked from the beginning credit sequence and it never let me go. I'm still kind of in a daze to be honest. Every frame of The Neon Demon is executed to absolute perfection. I cannot give the visuals enough praise. Honestly this is one of the best looking films I have ever seen. It's a five-course meal for the eyes. Also, the soundtrack/score is incredible. I RARELY buy a film's soundtrack and when I say rarely I mean never but I have already purchased the soundtrack from Amazon. Elle Fanning and Jenna Malone were both fantastic. There are so many things that stand out about TND: the music, performances, cinematography, lightning, editing, costumes, and makeup. Everything about this movie is so transfixing. I couldn't get enough. I LOVED this movie and I cannot wait to see it again and again and again.The Neon Demon is Nicolas Winding Refn's masterpiece and my favorite film of his. It's so bold and so captivating. My eyes were glued to the screen the entire run-time. I can't stop thinking about it. Seriously one of my new all-time favorite movies; I'm talking at least top 25 material.P.S. Even after those certain events, I still find Jenna Malone incredibly attractive."

A young model moves to town and a bunch of strange things happen. A model knife fight and cannibalism is all you have to know. It's nonsense. The longer the movie went the more I disliked it. I shouldn't be surprised as it was directed by the guy who did Drive, which in my opinion is one of the most overrated movies ever."
" One of my all-time favourites!!!
",2020-02-29 00:00:00,10,LOOOOOVEEEE the cinematography and aesthetic of this movie!! The storyline is entertaining and the main character is very likeable.
" Too pretensious to be good
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,3,"Small dialogs, small screenplay, lot of lights and makeup, and too pretensious, unconnected scenes makes you bore more than be aware of what's happening.
I still want back those two hours of my life."
" An Extra Star for that Eyeball
",2020-02-17 00:00:00,2,"I kept waiting for the vapid, empty secondary characters to do something to that vapid, empty lead. So, for that I was satisfied. It's hard to watch movies where I don't like any character. At one point early on, the lead literally admits to being in Hollywood because she has no skills other than her being pretty. It's just the worst kind of person living the worst kind of life; you're stuck for two hours watching a movie about people you'd ditch at a bar within five minutes.Reviews are saying ""all style, no substance,"" but I have to disagree on their being any style. The cinematography makes the film nearly unwatchable, and the actual fashion is super dated, like how you might imagine Vogue if you hadn't bothered to pick up an issue in 30 years. The final photo shoot was around a Los Angeles pool; you'd think that a film based around ""fashion"" would at least have a more fashionable, original idea. A pool in LA? Florals for Spring? Groundbreaking. That gold face makeup was cheap stickers on her face. That ""hot"" photographer not demanding she get redone was more shocking than that ending.Now, all this critique is for what you can see; the film is so dark and so ... neon - take an aspirin, you'll need it for the inevitable migraine.The ending of the movie would have been better as the opening premise, assuming the filmmaker had any interest in plot. A plot can carry a theme more easily than a theme can carry itself. The story, until the last 10 minutes, is weak and cliche and very boring. The most interesting thing was that eyeball, so maybe it could have started there."
" One of the best movies since Sunset Boulevard
",2020-02-08 00:00:00,9,"One of the best movies since Sunset Boulevard (of that genre).
It paints a disturbing but realistic picture of the fashion/modelling world in the first 80 mins. Then shocks the audience with a final 30 mins of black comedy combined with surrealistic horror, which is the directors way of expressing what he thinks of the industry he has portrayed. There are 1 or 2 scenes that are maybe a little gratuitous, hence my score of 9 (instead of 10), but this is a great movie and makes an important statement, something that too few movies do these days. Easily Refn's best movie. Elle Fanning's acting is great, and with this performance she has jumped right into the A-list of top female actors."
" What did I just watch?
",2020-01-20 00:00:00,4,"It's a beautiful film, I'll give you that, but the premise? Utter nonsense! I had a hard time trying to keep myself engaged in this foolishness. Let me assure you I am no prude, not by a long shot, but some scenes in this are just there for shock value, and I am talking about the mortuary scene. Why was that even done? It added nothing to the already convoluted story line. And why was Keanu Reeves even in this? His character could have been played by any Joe Smoe off the street! The 3 I guess we'll call them witches/vampires were so unlikable I can't see a small town girl ever deciding to befriend them even if she was straight off the bus! No one in this day and age of anti-bullying would put up with such shenanigans! The story was both boring and off-putting. I didn't care about anyone in this film...except for the would be boyfriend, he seemed somewhat normal I guess. Anyway if you just want to see nice cinematography I guess give this a shot but if you are looking for a good horror flick...keep looking."
" Classic Nicolas Winding Refn
",2020-01-17 00:00:00,9,This is a great film if you are already familiar with Refn's style. It has an abstract and artistic plotline that requires detailed attention. It is a beautifully weird movie and definitely has an interesting message. Definitely worth the watch.
" Very difficult to rate
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,5,"Enjoyed the weirdness, but not quite sure If I'd recommend it. Very difficult to rate."
" Elle Fanning is beautiful but
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,1,"Did Jena Malone really need to have sex with a corpse. That spitting into the corpse's mouth and sucking it back up was truly disgusting. When the model started retching, I started retching, thanks for that-then I continued to sympathy retch while she puked up the eyeball and then the other girl picks it up out of the puke and swallows it. Why was Keanu Reeves is this horrible movie playing a disgusting character. The neon lights were migraine inducing and also made little sense in the scheme of things. I realize the person making it was color blind but that flashing neon was jut not necessary."
" This film explores topics of beauty, jealousy and vampires
",2019-12-16 00:00:00,10,"I watched this film like a week ago. I was impressed, but after thinking more and more about it, I am ready to say that this was one of the best films I've seen in life. Don't want to talk too much about visual and soundtrack - they are STUNNING and could make this movie alone. You can find that in other reviews. I want to talk about what else this film has to offer.The pacing is slow, not as slow as 2001 but still. Story is pretty simple, a 16 year girl from countryside comes to LA to pursue a model career. She has natural beauty while her competitors have implants and plastic surgeries. In a blink of an eye, all the 'important people' like photographers and designers are thrilled with her.
This film explores topics of beauty, jealousy and vampires in a cruel field of beauty business. Beauty is a slippery thing - if you are born pretty, you are lucky. If you're not - you can try and undergo a bunch of plastic surgeries like Sara and Gigi did just to be ""OKAY"". Then Jessie comes around and you are instantly out of the game, no matter how hard you try. Jessie possesses natural beauty and is genetically superior to any other model in the film.
This beauty of Jessie is a gift and a curse at the same time. She falls in love with her self image and then we are presented with Neon Demon herself - a self-confident and arrogant woman who is ready to exercise her unmatchable superiority.
Which ultimately gets her killed. But what made the ending so shocking is how understandable and even relatable it felt. The film presents murder, cannibalism and occultism from a perspective of hopeless attempt of 'simple' people trying to fight the nature.To sum up, The Neon Demon is one-of-a-kind masterpiece. I loved watching every minute of it. I loved remembering it and trying to understand it.
I am very sad about people who found it boring or lacking substance. Clearly chickenheads were not the target audience here."
" Like being tortured but slowly
",2019-12-11 00:00:00,1,"There are movies that deserve 1 star because they are just boring, but this movie is way beyond that and is one of the few movies I've ever seen that deserves a rating below 1. It isn't just boring, it's so slow you will feel like you are being tortured. Beyond a doubt sticks in my mind as one of the worst films I have ever seen. Just nonsense and stupidity all done slowly. Models walk around slowly. Models apply make-up slowly. You'll feel like you are dying a slow death. I have no idea why I even finished it other then to see where it was going. Eventually it becomes grotesque but slowly. It's garbage disguised as art and all done slowly."
" I felt like I just watched a YouTube video
",2019-12-07 00:00:00,1,"I get it. The fashion industry being tough as nails but this feels so amateur, I could've written that in a 10 minute video. The cinematography is just distracting, it felt like I was in a museum in LA. The cyan & magenta is cliche af. Lots of light leak distractions. As a photographer, we would never touch the model without asking. Lots of holes in this movie. Character dev is horrible too...>.>"
" Mince
",2019-11-20 00:00:00,1,"This movie is a lot of mince, thank god for fast forward buttons. I take it Keanu Reeves has retired from acting, well he didn't do any in this lot of rubbish."
" Great film...

" Sad Affair
",2019-11-19 00:00:00,5,"Refn is too good a film director to make ridiculous movies, but in this... affected, bad move... he got closer. Extremely long to say the least. It takes 116 minutes of your life to tell you what The Temptations sang in less than three minutes, in their hit ""Beauty Is Only Skin Deep""."
" Wonderful scenery but weirdly executed plot
",2019-11-14 00:00:00,5,"The first hour was a four star film, the last hour a one star. So I'm not even sure what to rate it now. Nothing saddens me more than when the first half is no less than amazing and the second is bleurgh.The light in this film is stunning, and so is the scenery and cinematography. Actually I have rarely seen such beautiful work. The music is haunting and ethereal, and the whole set is like a mix between Twin Peaks and the glossiest fashion show ever seen. The quiet scenes are the most effectful, while the dialogues are often stiff and unnatural. I read that director Nicolas Winding Refn asked Elle Fanning to revise the female spoken dialogues - can't really say it helped. It did really sound like a writer not knowing how woman speak to each other.So, the first half. I was so amazed. Elle is really great in her role as Jesse, I could really feel her loneliness and strong wish to achieve her dream of being a model. The framing in every scene is so well thought out, like when Jesse first meet the famous photographer and the scenery is almost covering the entire frame with first it's light and then it's darkness. When Sarah is rejected by the fashion designer, who is completely ignorant to her, and smashes the mirror in the bathroom her pain blazes through the camera. And when Jesse hurts her hand and Sarah drinks her blood - that's horrifying and shows so well her desperation to get what Jesse has.And that leads me to the second half. Sarah drinking Jesse's blood was horrifying enough and perfectly captures what the film wants to say. But then it went downhill. From the second Jesse stepped into the mansion the scenes were strange in a really creepy way. Unsettling can be great, and in the first half of the movie, it really is.But in the second half those scenes are downright disturbing. The last forty minutes felt sensational and voyeristic with it's lesbian predatory trope. And the necrophilia scene was too much, crossing it with the scenes of Jesse touching herself put extremely disturbing equal signs between being lesbian and necroromantic, no matter what the actual point with it was. This film would have been a lot better without the ritual thing.There are ways to tell the same story about our society with it's obsession with beauty and doing everything it takes to achieve it - without sexualizing the hunt.(Oh, and frankly the movie would also have been better without Dean, he's such a typical ""good"" photography guy who just want to take pictures of pretty girls. It was disturbing how he was somehow depicted as being righteous in the ""beauty is the only thing"" scene. It felt like that was his only purpose.)I hope someone will take this idea and make a new film from it, but without over-the-top elements shown in this film. The obsession with beauty is always current and interesting."
" Not for everyone...obviously
",2019-11-10 00:00:00,8,"For instance, don't watch it with your kids...or your grandmother with a heart condition...or with your pastor, or at a work party, or on date night with your Ken doll or Larry the Cable Guy figurine or a confused confused Door Dash delivery boy you dragged in to pretend to be your date. Okay, maybe the last guy - if he's riding the flow state.But all in all, it's generally best viewed at new moon art shows, illuminati discos and JP Morgan' annual masquerade ball. If you can deal with abstraction, open ended fantasy and don't need a YouTube commentator to hold your hand and explain what you're watching in lieu of dialogue. If you like Borges stories, Argento films and exploring the primal darkness in the human ego then git in thar & have a looksee.The panning is invariably the result of Transformers fans getting lured into an arthouse flick by the promise of gorey T&A. Quite likely many of them are the joke here - some people are laughing and they don't get it and it makes them feel anxious, so they lash out with 1 star reviews.Keanu Reeves slays as a total creepshow. Elle Fanning nails it. There is only one somewhat sympathetic character and we feel that perhaps it was only a matter of time before he succumbed to the viral madness around him. While I don't typically enjoy movies without a character relate to, the underlying conundrum of existence in this world is what's there to empathize with (in place of an audience surrogate character, we have an audience surrogate emotion hanging over the whole narrative, if you were one who could follow it). Realizing that everyone and everything is hostile becomes the most gripping part of a movie that is suddenly holding you captive as the prey. There are jackals circling a small rabbit on screen but soon there are only jackals and they are all looking at you, and you are alone in the dark. Don't blink, don't avert your eyes. Stare it down.I agree with another reviewer that said it could, perhaps should, have been shorter. The actual ending feels like a bonus scene, an epilogue that could have rolled after the credits. The pacing didn't need to be so slow and the extended closure broke the smooth flow of the film, somewhat, which was essentially resolved at 90 min. However, the 2 hour mark is interesting nonetheless."
" Young and Thin
",2019-11-08 00:00:00,5,Rather obviously patterned after 'Mullholland Dr.' with added necrophilia. Like the fashion industry itself this movie is either taking itself very seriously indeed or is one long leg pull. The synthesised score adds to the feel of a seventies or eighties slasher movie with glossy 21st Century pretensions.
" The Neon Demon
",2019-11-04 00:00:00,5,"I remember seeing the poster for this movie, it had a terrific use of colour, and it reminded me of a classic 80s or 90s poster, I was most interested to see the film as well, directed by Nicolas Winding Refn (Bronson, Drive, Only God Forgives). Basically, following the death of her parents, sixteen-year-old aspiring model Jesse (Maleficent's Elle Fanning, Dakota's sister) has relocated from small-town Georgia to Los Angeles. She meets photographer Dean (Karl Glusman), who does her first shoot, and makeup artist Ruby (Jena Malone), who introduces fellow models Sarah (Abbey Lee) and Gigi (Bella Heathcote). The three women are intrigued by Jesse's natural beauty and curious about her sexuality and experience. Jesse is signed by modeling agency owner Roberta Hoffman (Christina Hendricks), who tells her to pretend she is nineteen and refers her to a test shoot with notable photographer Jack McCarther (Desmond Harrington). Jesse goes on a date with Dean but holds back on his advances. Jesse is staying in a motel, owned by the lecherous Hank (Keanu Reeves), and one night she is shocked to find her room ransacked and occupied by a mountain lion. Jesse is extremely nervous undressing for the photo shoot with Jack, who covers her naked body in gold paint. The shoot is successful, and Gigi and Sarah begin envying Jesse's youth, while Ruby is fascinated with her. Jesse goes to a casting call for fashion designer Robert Sarno (Jurassic Park III's Alessandro Nivola), where Sarah is also present. He pays no attention to Sarah but is entranced by Jesse. Sarah is distraught and asks Jesse how it feels to be the one everyone admires. Jesse replies, ""It's everything"". Sarah lunges toward her, and Jesse accidentally cuts her hand on glass. Sarah immediately sucks the blood from Jesse's hand. Jesse returns to her motel and faints, having strange vision, and Dean arrives to treat her wounds. At Sarno's fashion show, Gigi tells Jesse about all the cosmetic surgery she has had done and cannot believe that Jesse has not used casting couches to achieve success. As Jesse is closing the show, she sees a vision of the glowing triangle she saw before in her hallucination. After the show, a visibly changed Jesse goes out with Dean to a bar. There, Sarno criticises surgically enhanced women, referring to a humiliated Gigi, and he praises Jesse's natural looks. Jesse is now displaying a narcissistic new persona and rejects Dean when he tries to convince her to leave with him. Jesse has a nightmare of being forced by Hank to sexually swallow a knife. After waking from this nightmare, Jesse is terrified by an attempted intruder, the stranger leaves her door and instead assaults the female occupant next door. Jesse calls Ruby to come over. After calming her down, Ruby tries to initiate sex with her, but Jesse rejects her, revealing herself to be a virgin. Ruby draws a lipstick face on Jesse's mirror, and leaves for her second job as a makeup artist at a morgue. There she satisfies her urges and pleasures herself with a female corpse. Ruby returns home and finds Jesse now unabashed in her narcissism. Sarah and Gigi appear at the house, and attack Jesse. Gigi chases her with a butcher knife, while Sarah pursues her with a fire-poker. Jesse is cornered outside by the three women, and Ruby pushes her into an empty swimming pool, breaking her leg. As Jesse lies helpless, the three women approach her with knives. After they butcher Jesse and consume parts of her body, Ruby bathes in a bathtub of her blood, while Sarah and Gigi wash themselves with it in the shower. Later, Ruby, who is revealed to have occult tattoos on her abdomen, sprays the sidewalk with Jesse's blood. She lies in Jesse's unmarked grave, and later, nude in her living room, a torrent of blood gushes from her genitals. The next day, Sarah drives Gigi along the Pacific Coast Highway to one of Jack's photoshoots. Jack sees Sarah in the living room, enthralled he fires another model on the spot. During the shoot, Gigi feels ill and leaves. Sarah watches Gigi regurgitate one of Jesse's eyeballs. She screams with regret, ""I need to get her out of me"" and stabs herself with a pair of scissors. Sarah watches Gigi die and eats the eyeball and returns to the photoshoot. It ends with a woman, who does not show her face walking alone in the Mojave Desert (it could be Sarah). Also starring Charles Baker as Mikey. Fanning gives a good performance as the initially nervous and slowly turned young beauty, Malone, Hendricks and the other actresses also do well as the fellow models who have daggers for the leading character. The title of the film is not really explained, I guess it has something to with the use of colour, which is fantastically vibrant. This could be a seen as satire of the fashion industry, the scary elements include the themes of deadly jealousy, cannibalism and necrophilia, it is visually impressive, even the graphic material, and the trippy electronic score by Cliff Martinez is brilliant, a stylish and interesting psychological horror. Worth watching!"
" Well Done Cinematography and Directing, But Lacking In Other Areas
",2019-10-28 00:00:00,5,"This film is well done when it comes to cinematography and directing, but when it comes to other areas it is lacking. First of all it is marketed as a horror movie, but it isn't a horror movie, it is a thriller. So it was disappointing when I sat down in the mood for a horror movie. It also moves too slow for the way they marketed it. If it was a psychological drama it would have been fine. But I thought it was going to have more action, so it didn't meet my expectations. When the horror does come, there's no real action and killing. They do however gross you out by showing you some of the most disgusting things you'll ever see in film.Third of all, the story is flawed in my opinion. Elle Flannings character is envied by all of these super models who are so much hotter than her. And yet in this film they act like she is super model hot and all of these other models pale in comparison. Anyone with eyes can see how flawed that is. She is more of a cute but plain girl next door type and these super models make her look even plainer in comparison. So the whole premise of the story just doesn't work for me.Its a shame that I feel the need to give it a 5 because it has such good cinematography and directing and is so artfully well done, but the set up is very flawed and lacking and I have to be honest. It left me disappointed and slightly frustrated."
" Artistic view with a certain mindset
",2019-10-20 00:00:00,8,"The movie is a slow burn let's agree on that, but it has a symbolic idea of beauty and perfection, which is by the end of the movie is contract and clear."
" Must-see for high-concept , art house horror fans. 7.8/10
",2019-10-13 00:00:00,8,"Director: Nicholas Winding Refn
Cast: Elle Fanning, Jena Malone, Keanu Reeves, Abbey Lee, and Bella HeathcoteAn aspiring model, Jesse, is new to Los Angeles. However, her beauty and youth, which generate intense fascination and jealousy within the fashion industry, may prove themselves sinister.This film definitely falls in the ""love it or hate it"" category. It is methodical, dark, and forces the viewer to come to their own conclusions. And yet, if you're willing to go where The Neon Demon is taking you, one will have had a mind trip in the weirdest possible directions and a physical reaction to it that is something I rarely ever get with films. It's 100% worth the ride.To its credit, the film deliberately avoids the horror cliches that first jump to mind, instead stretching for a unique ending you actually won't see coming.Every frame could be plucked from the screen and placed in between the covers of a very gruesome version of Vogue. The films soundtrack composed by Cliff Martinez is spot on with the tone of the film and ranges from unsettling and scary atmospheres to full on techno.This film is a must-see for high-concept , art house horror fans. 7.8/10"
" Visually Arresting
",2019-10-10 00:00:00,5,"This film was full of really beautiful looking characters who were all diametrically repugnant underneath. At the finale, you realize you couldn't care less about what happens to any of them. It may have been the point."
" Elle fanning is the best part... Other than that... Meh
",2019-09-30 00:00:00,2,Meh. Boring. Keanu Reeves awesome. More. Not less. What? Lights? Don't waste 2hrs.
" Meeh
",2019-09-23 00:00:00,5,It was a nice looking movie. Beautiful women nice cinematography. But the storyline was abrupt and unbelievable. It's like this bizarre plot just shows up out of nowhere.
" Beautiful workmanship, a sick fantasy of no particular value to the viewer.
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,1,"The vision of this movie attracted me to watch it. The cast also. But the plot itself did not hold my interest. The image of the main character was not particularly original. But I liked the classic juxtaposition of good and evil, innocence and provocation, the natural beauty and the falsehood behind the created. However, the film did not impress me as much as I expected and I lost interest in it before the end. And the end was absolute insanity for 20 minutes. Beautiful workmanship, a sick fantasy of no particular value to the viewer."
" A visually appealing fashion catalogue on screen lacking substance.
",2019-09-16 00:00:00,3,"This is a film by Nicolas Winding Refn, which is a visual feast, featuring top celebrities. It features Elle Fanning as Jesse, an aspiring model who meets make-up artist Ruby (Jena Malone from 'the Hunger Games' fame, among others) and two fellow models Gigi (Bella Heathcote, 'Neighbours,' 'Fifty Shades Darker') and Sarah (Abbey Lee, 'Mad Max: Fury Road,' 'Office Christmas Party'). As other models, such as Gigi and Sarah, work hard for where they are and are nearing their 'expiration dates,' Jesse experiences success rather quickly. She befriends Ruby, Gigi and Sarah, but soon learns that the trio soon becomes resentful of her good-looks and success.I saw this movie pop up on Netflix and decided to give it a go because of the actors and it looked visually appealing. Unfortunately, this is just what it is, visually appealing. I was disappointed because I know the calibre that these actresses can go, but that performance I know them for just wasn't delivered in this film. Perhaps that had something to do with the writing and story, which left little to be desired. The story had potential, but because of the writing, it didn't get very far. Instead, there's no true substance to this movie at all. It's like looking at the latest edition of Vogue Magazine - the wardrobe, lighting and make-up are there, and look stunning, but not only is there no text to accompany those photos, there's also nothing about the models wearing those clothes. Sure, there's dialogue, but it's all superficial s***; the dialogue doesn't add any depth to the characters. Therefore, the audience doesn't feel any connection with the said characters and we don't really care what happens to them. This movie is just reiterating what we've long suspected (which has been proven untrue) that models are just airheads who lack any real depth and are more concerned with their looks than anything else.The soundtrack is bizarre and shouldn't be in such a film. But, considering that the film, itself, is bizarre, I guess it suits.I don't know if I'd see this movie again. Apart from the visual feast, this movie is lacking in anything real and, therefore, I give it 3.5/5 stars."
" A boring attempt at a moden Mullholand Drive
",2019-08-02 00:00:00,1,"This film is like watching a fashion designers attempt at recreating Mullholand Drive without reading the script or seeing the film.Although Neon Deamon has a top billed cast the good performances from the cast dose not save the audience from the terrible writing and direction this film has. While the film promotes ""blood, gore and body horror"" horror fans will be disappointed with this film as it has less blood than any moden free to air tv.The only horror this movie has is the amount of your free time it will waste"
" Such a great cinematography
",2019-08-01 00:00:00,7,"I can understand the harsh reviews, this movie isn't for everyone but it's such a GORGEOUS movie, every shot is so aesthetically pleasing and i like it so much, the story and the acting were fine too it's disturbing yes but absolutely not a waste of time"
" Disjointed, horrible plot...
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,1,"Honestly, if you have the choice between watching Tremors 4 or this movie, choose Tremors 4."
" Weird but stimulating movie.
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,5,"I have seen this movie floating by my face on my streaming service for years and finally decided to watch it. It has always made me sad that many young ladies endure so much pain to obtain the look of a supermodel.. As a man that used to train both male & female athletes, and studied anatomy i can tell you this look is not only unhealthy, but it is also not realistic. Yes we love a nice chin, neckline, supple breast, and the way the curve of the back descends into the buttocks. The look of these Women come from constant starvation & very important nutritional deprivation. The ironic thing is that it is always some average looking person that somehow posesses God like powers to set the standards for beauty. The movies uses great colors for references and really sheds some light on the superficial aspects of modeling and all the hatred and jealousy that it involves. Young ladies need to understand that true beauty is not on the front of the superficial magazine covers, it is being the best you that you can be. Have a healthy food plan, workout with, weights, cardio, yoga, etc. Never deprive yourself of proper nutrition & you will be the best you possible & beautiful. Never let someone set the standard of beauty for you, set it for yourself !!"
" Psychological Horror/Thriller!
",2019-07-21 00:00:00,10,"This movie is not for everyone. If you're going to watch it, i'm already telling you to keep your brain open to understand what's going on. If you didn't understood what's happening, it will be boring as hell for you. It's not a general horror movie which is gonna tell you it's story in a straight forward way. You have to use your mind to understand it. Also to people who didn't understand it, please don't rate it then or give negative reviews. You people are only spoiling the reputation of the movie. It's an amazing psychological movie. I would recommend it to everyone for sure!"
" This is not art.
",2019-07-18 00:00:00,1,A pretty poor attempt at making a controversial film.
" Pointless and garbled
",2019-07-07 00:00:00,1,"No plot. No character development. No meaning. No sense. There's blood, necrophilia, strange comings and goings that are never explained and some meaningful art noir foreign film type posturings that are rendered utterly meaningless when there's no point the whole movie. It's a bit like watching some dirty old man's dream. God knows how it got funding. I couldn't make head nor tail of it. Oh, and it had a Fin ending. Yawn."
" This film is simply horrible
",2019-07-07 00:00:00,1,"It starts off decently so don't be fooled by the nice aesthetics, as it proceeds it becomes awful. It's also very disgusting, it left me such a bad feeling and thaught me absolutely nothing."
" If You Like Radiohead...
",2019-07-07 00:00:00,3,"If you are a fan of Radiohead this is right up your street. A pretentious meandering of self indulgent drivel, that makes one lose the will to live & an ending that is so meaningless, you could better enjoy your time counting grains of rice.
Literally one of the worst films I have ever seen..."
" Don't waste your time
",2019-07-04 00:00:00,1,Stunning colors reminiscent of Kubrick in spots. Aside from that there was no substance a literal waste of time. Story was weak and moved very slow.
" my notes
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,3,"Cool style and tone. was interesting for a while. but as the movie went along, it became obvious that this was another prime example of style over substance. the entire basis of this movie was the style, and there was almost no substance. there is a bunch of stuff that is supposed to shock you, but it's only there for that purpose. this movie is just really weird, and not in a good way. halfway through the movie i still had no idea what it was about or what was really happening. i liked drive, i hated only god forgives, and i hated this almost as much. I have determined that I'm not a fan of director Refn. (1 viewing)"
" What a waste of time
",2019-06-29 00:00:00,3,"I have no clue what I just watched. It was not good in any capacity. The visuals gave me a headache and made an already boring movie way too drawn out. Keanu Reeves made it bearable, as well as Christina Hendricks, but neither of them were in the film a whole lot. The only reason I'm giving it three stars is because of Keanu Reeves."
" Suspiria this ain't
",2019-06-29 00:00:00,5,"So this has been compared with Suspiria which is one of my all time favourite films so I had to see this, although I doubted the comparison was apt. No one can do Argento. And sure enough, this is no Suspiria. Yes, it is stylish. I liked the colours, I even kind of liked the music. It has a eerie, haunting quality that I also liked - but the huge, enormous problem with this, and the reason I don't think it can be compared with Suspiria is that it takes itself pretty seriously! There is clearly meant to be some kind of subtext here, and boy, has it been done - the modelling world, Hollywood, LA is soulless and shallow, women are, well quite literally here, chewed up and spat out. Well ho hum, we know right?!And this isn't a redeeming film, in fact it is exploitative. The males in this film have all the power - the sleazy, rapey hotel owner, the sleazy, rapey photographer, the sleazy, rapey designer. Ugh, and the women in this film just grovel before these men, completely submissive, and then they turn on one another! So, no empowerment here. Honestly, Abbey Lee, who for some reason signed on for this even though it is kind of an insult to her and her kind, is 29 and still modelling, still successful, still looks amazing, and yet, in this film it's the same old same old 'You are past it once you hit 21' line.Not sure why everyone is so offended by the necrophilia scene - I thought that was about the only self-aware scene in the whole film, the only scene that acknowledged this is a pretty silly movie.So, this is definitely not going to knock Suspiria off it's perch any time soon. Argento knew he was making trash, he embraced it and Suspiria is a classic for just that reason. It didn't try to be something it isn't. See this for the colours and the costumes, mostly it just bored me."
" For the amateurs of fresh flesh. Figuratively and literally.
",2019-06-27 00:00:00,4,"The brilliant Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn has already offered us the sumptuous Drive (2011) as well as interesting movies like Valhalla Rising (2009), Bronson (2008) or Bleeder (1999). In The Neon Demon (2016), Nicolas Winding Refn locks himself in a world dominated with an always ultra-neat and globally irreproachable aesthetics and characters who are deliberately cold and devoid of empathy. After the first 20/30 minutes, we understood the message and the film would have benefited from being a short film. Que nenni! The film languishes and barely conveys emotion, with a few surrealistic and bloody scenes. Thus, the last third of the film is a show as gore as annoying. As a synthesis: visually amazing but desperately boring."
" Brilliant, twisted and disturbing, entertaining
",2019-06-15 00:00:00,10,"Such a good film, disgusting in some places, didn't make sense sometimes but I love that kind of film (if it's done well, which it was with this film). Dark and clever, great camera shots and imagery, great actors, includes every disturbing act u can think off (almost). Grim, clever, scary, brilliantly filmed, reveals an aspect of the ugly truth of the fashion industry in way"
" Nobody can relate to art this low.
",2019-04-30 00:00:00,1,"There is absolutely no humanity or common sense.One scene to skip to that underlines the movie is where Elle Fannings character is told to take everything off in a photoshoot. - She acts like a deer in the headlights (unrealistic), no one says relax (unrealistic), the photographer acts like a serial killer (unrealistic), he walks out of the dark and slaps gold paint on her using slow-motion attacking movements (unrealistic), shot from the shoulders up (cowardly) so you don't see how rediculous the whole scene is.In other scenes, people bath in blood as if the artistic message is they're suffering for their art. In reality, in the model world, if you don't like what you're doing you get out of the kitchen because no one wants to see a depressed person. Nobody buys that product.It's an example of a confused director who thinks being upbeat is the devil and so has sought to be as downbeat, slow, confused, and psychotic as possible... Then stick it all in a film as if it's art."
" Reviews speak for themselves
",2019-04-12 00:00:00,7,"I was coming along to write a serious review until I read the others - including one describing Fanning as ""short and pudgy"". I'd say this just about sums up the issues facing women in society, and with which this film is primarily interested. It's far from perfect - it's cliched and I did wonder whether the content would be at all revelatory to anyone, until I read other reviews which fail to detect the irony of their criticism."
" Under-rated
",2019-03-18 00:00:00,9,"Okay! Where to start? The acting: Elle Fanning is a superstar in the making! The ensemble cast are outstanding! The cinematography is just over-the-top, as is the music and sound! This is a ""cult classic""!"
" Don't waste your time
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,4,I felt watching this movie was very wasting time. And Fanning is not beautiful as much as models and acting is nothing special.
" I DO NOT LIKE THIS FILM
",2019-03-14 00:00:00,4,"Some people might hate me for saying this but I think this film is awful. Even though it is directed in a beautiful way that all it has going for it. The script is an unpolished mess with a awful Climax. I feel like the writer write most of the script then realised that it wasn't an 18 so put a ton of stuff at the end which has a lot of blood and sexual scenes in the final 15 minutes. The reasoning behind the ending makes no sense to me. (spoiler part) at the end the girls kill and eat our main character so they can become pretty. But how does eating someone makes you our pretty on the outside wouldn't it make more sense if they wanted to be an overall nicer person instead of just looking pretty. And what was with all of the triforces in this film. You might think I'm joking but I'm dead serious they are triforces all over this film. I half expected ganon to come out and try to steal it. The first 100 or so minutes of the film is the most generic screenwriting I have ever seen. I felt like I was watching a parady film because most of the film is just cliché after cliché in a boring mess with underdeveloped characters. The Climax just comes out of nowhere with very little to no build up to it one moment our main character is walking through the house the next moment she is being chased by crazy girls with knifes and your just like ""where the heck did this come from"" making you feel like it's missing a lot of scenes. And I mean a lot of scenes. Overall it has great directing in it but everything else is pretty terrible. You might say I don't get it and maybe I don't. But that dosent excuse the most generic screenplay ever and it felt more like a parady"
" Vapid v a p o r w a v e circle jerk.
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,1,"I try to keep an open mind for anything in the thriller / horror genre, but this was about as exciting as getting a handjob from an amputee. Terribly boring film."
" 2nd worst movie ever!
",2019-03-09 00:00:00,1,"How people have given this rubbish 8-10 stars is beyond me! It is just a load of arty farty pretentious nonsense pretending to be a horror story! This is the second WORST movie I have ever seen (Antichrist being the worst) and the fact that some people think it is entertaining makes me think 'Am I missing siomething?' The girl is not that attractive, the other two models you see are far more attractive, and even the make up artist is sexier! There are lots of silent scenes with just music in the background and I guess that is a clue that this is a arty movie. And Keeanu Reeves?? He's in it for about 10 minutes total! Avoid at all costs."
" Stylish but incomprehensible ...
",2019-03-03 00:00:00,6,"This is the story of a nice girl who enters into a nasty town and a dark business: of course, her modelling career is superficially bright white and pink neon. But when Jesse (Ellie Fanning) wanders into a studio photo-shoot, all fairy-tale dress and golden locks, and the Neanderthal photographer Jack (Desmond Harrington) tells her to take off her clothes, the awkwardness is all consuming. She is 16 years old, has been told to tell anyone who asks that she is 19.Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn takes his time with the atmospherics and gives us plenty of reason to feel for naïve Jesse. Cliff Martinez's music is very Eighties, very electronic. But where is all this going, I wonder as I watch?Smiling turns to sneering as other models become increasingly jealous of Jesse's natural beauty and un-cynical personality. This is a cut-throat, production-line, cattle market catwalk trade. With that leisurely established, events are free to become more and ever more disturbing, gory and surreal. Previously dependable characters reveal themselves to have strange depths and perversions that border on unreality.This film ultimately could be many things: a comment on the fashion world, the vagaries and obsessions with beauty and perfection, or simply the superficial silliness of human beings. What started as a fairly coherent story slides sideways into weird set pieces rather than going forward in any traditional way. The lack of depth to the characters and plot could be said to mirror the superficial business about which events revolve, or it could be attributed to a project that is more style over substance. It is not easy to categorise, nor is it meant to be, I suspect, but I quite enjoyed it as a horror film along the lines of David Lynch or JG Ballard. It doesn't need to take so long to tell its story, I think, but the acting is first rate. Keanu Reeves, never a huge favourite of mine, is great as the deeply unpleasant landlord Hank, and Fanning excels as the burgeoning central character."
" I have no clue what I just watched.
",2019-02-25 00:00:00,2,"First, mad kudos to Natasha Braier for the amazing cinematography. Love the look of it, even though it felt maybe a little staged (too much of set designs), but it fitted this dreamy film. However, I cannot say the same thing about the story. It was just bizarre. Too artsy for my taste.The acting seemed fine, which is usually an issue in most films. A little too derivative from David Mamet perhaps (Mamet's style is very wooden/deadpan). Either way, it didn't bother me too much. I'm still trying to figure out, however, what the movie was about. They could have gone in a different and better direction with maybe pushing the lead, Elle, to doing different crazy stuff, sexual, etc, but although the trailer sorta implied that was happening we really never saw it come to fruition.Other movies have explored the theme of someone entering a new business and getting pushed into things they would have never done otherwise. Again, this movie just didn't even go there. It teased, but never went there. Too bad.It wasn't a horror movie. It wasn't a sexual/love story. It was a very confused movie."
" Fashion is Evil and You'll Sell Your Soul
",2019-02-15 00:00:00,9,The metaphors are heavy. Jena Malone says to newbie Elle Fanning - Lipstick sells best when named for food or sex. What are you? Food or sex? Some visually amazing scenes - namely Elle's cross to the dark side quite literally falling in love with herself. It's a slippery slope. The moon plays heavily. This is not for everyone and the director is obviously obsessed with the occult. I loved it.
" Terrible!
",2019-02-01 00:00:00,1,Please do a favor to yourself and do not waste your time watching this movie! You may get depressed of watching a movie so terrible and without any substance. Poor girl...
" Why shadow
",2019-01-22 00:00:00,8,"Yes why shadow a woman's genitals, this just shows how it's a double standard Hollywood so boring just knowing your never going to see an actual vagina clearly in an R rated movie, I'm so over these movies."
" Wouldn't recommend it, but I liked it cos...
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,8,"...it's weird, stylish and... yeah... because of Elle Fanning. If you like those things don't miss it. (If I had read that review I would have watched the movie right away)."
" A Beautifully Photography, Soft Horror Thriller that Loses Steam
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,7,"9 November 2016. The Neon Demon (2016). This supposedly minimalist, artistic horror thriller fails capture a sustained and defining moments of horror-filled satiation. A beautifully photographed movie with nicely edited scenes that are enveloped with an ethereal and acoustic soundtrack is eventually let down by a fragmented and mentally tortured ending series of sequences. The director uses elements found in David Lynch's strange weirdness, enhances on the electronic visualization found in Galaxy of Terror (1981), and the strong, solid colorification of the B-Noir Liquid Dreams (1992). Even with the incorporation of a few horror themes usually off-limits in most horror movies really don't sustain the suspense and pacing of the movie. The Neon Demon doesn't rise to Lars von Trier's the sharply photographed Melancholia (2011), the nice cinematography of Walter Salles' Dark Water (2005), or the well-crafted psychological thriller Black Swan (2010). A much better, well-rounded and psychologically themed horror film with a similar tone and deliberate pacing is Scarlett Johannsen performance in Under the Skin (2013)."
" I think it's brilliant

" amazing work
",2018-12-23 00:00:00,10,"Pictures of absolute aesthetics, that pull you inside. Then the peripeteia. Shock. a must see movie. But not for the fainted heart."
" Quite shallow
",2018-12-09 00:00:00,5,"Is The Neon Demon art? Or is just trying to be?Some of the directing/camera work is brilliant, along with the use of colors.
Not to mention that some tracks of the soundtrack are pretty good.While the basic story had potential, the actual storytelling is terrible.One may philosophize about the movie's deeper meaning.
Shallow personalities without inner qualities being obsessed with beauty, especially in the modern world of today, even more in a city that's infamous for the lack of substance of any kind, LA.Maybe The Neon Demon is nothing but an ironic allegory, using the world of the model business to show the obsession with style over substance in movies nowadays. ;)But that's not good enough, unfortunately.
I want from a movie to get either an interesting, complex story or action/horror (whatever the genre normally suggests), preferably both.Also, it didn't help that the film is too long with no pace at all, and characters I didn't care about. It can be watched, but there is no need to.
Drive (and Only God Forgives) are much better examples of the director's talent.Rating it 5, but only because of the colors and music used. Normally it would be less."
" BRILLIANTLY DONE IN EVERY ASPECT!
",2018-12-04 00:00:00,10,"The best horror film ever made in 2016! Everything from locations, directing, cinematography, lighting, storyline & acting was absolutely stunning in every detail. This man is a brilliant director when it came to making this film. If you've not seen it make certain you do as you'll embark on a journey from the likes you've never been on before. Hopefully one day I'll be able to work with this director, he's extremely creative in every aspect & has talent like no other."
" A very polarizing movie that I thoroughly enjoy
",2018-12-04 00:00:00,9,"Just to start right off the bat, I'm a big Nicolas Winding Refn fan. I've only watched 4 of his movies, and I worship all of them. Even the not so great Only God Forgives, I still highly appreciate for its uniqueness. Drive is one of my favorites, Bronson was a really solid movie for it's superbly low budget, Only God Forgives is a very tough movie to watch, but there is many things to appreciate while watching it. The Neon Demon falls along the style of Only God Forgives. Drive and Bronson were very accessible films, ones that most audiences wouldn't hate. Only God Forgives and The Neon Demon are not so mainstream like Refn's other films. Definitely my favorite thing about The Neon Demon is its complexity and style. This movie isn't so straightforward, and many audiences might not like that. There are scenes that on the surface, might not make sense, but in the context of the story and its deeper meanings will make sense in terms of why that scene is in the movie. I can describe the movie's style as eye candy, and also, not holding back it's violence and gore. There are time where I feel disgusted watching this movie, and at other times, feeling hypnotized on what is going on. I like to watch movies where I get a strong reaction from what is going on, and this movie succeeds in that. The movie also doesn't have much dialogue either. This movie is mostly visual storytelling, and it is used beautifully. The overarching message in this movie is also horrifying, if you really think about it, and it is also very realistic. Some unsettling things that happened in this movie certainly happened in real life, and I'm just saying that this movie portrays objectification, jealousy, and how beauty is represented in the real world. The only complaint I have with this movie is that sometimes there is too much violence, and I feel like Refn is just putting stuff on screen that he enjoys. But, this movie is definitely my second favorite Refn film, and I really can't get enough of it. This movie gives me chills just thinking about it. I'd give The Neon Demon a 9/10"
" weird but enjoyable
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,9,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it is a case study of how shallow and the shelf life of models in the spotlight. The direction and screenplay are both really good. The casting and acting are both really good also. All in all I would give this four out of a possible five stars.
" Overlong perfume commercial
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,6,"Amazing film to look at but the story lacks any sort of direction,certain characters are not really explained why they are in the film,thought it would delve more into the fashion model world given the director's wife was a model,The saving grace for this film is the amazing film score(Cliff Martinez)it is truly brilliant,Definitely worth buying the soundtrack"
" A taut wire of constant predatory threat
",2018-11-17 00:00:00,7,"There appear to be some who think this is a movie about the fashion industry. If so, it has about as much to say about fashion as ""Suspira"" has to say about ballet. Really, this film is about obsession, loneliness, fear and the crippling tension of being on constant guard against the attack of predators. Alone and vulnerable in Los Angeles, Jesse (Elle Fanning) is a skittish prey animal surrounded by the dangers of the urban jungle. As she navigates the threats around her, she transforms into a kind of predator herself. But she will soon discover that not all killers hunt alone."
" Film Liquet on The Neon Demon
",2018-11-07 00:00:00,4,"Jesse (Elle Fanning) is a 16-year-old teen that just moved to Los Angeles; looking to become a model, the agency convinces her that she needs to pose as a 19-year-old in order to get into the business without any troubles. Furthermore, the other models get envious of her beauty and she puts up with a creepy photographer and a nasty motel manager.The film is covered with bizarre visual elements and editing techniques. However unsettling it may be, it is mesmerising to watch the work of Natasha Braier, who uses many contrasts of light, darkness and an abundance of colours to match the moods of the film. The make up in the film has a great amount of detail put into it and is stylised to match the film's peculiar design elements. The film looks alien almost, being so perfect and yet having so many creative choices behind it, it certainly has a unique look.Disregarding the aesthetics of the film, the story although very clear is riddled with elements of psychological horror, making it almost seem like the film crosses into the art-house genre. The twisted, nightmarish horror is a flawed masterpiece, as even though the mind-blowing cinematic elements do raise the film to a high standard, the story and the characters are underdeveloped. The movie relies on the aesthetics mostly, and although it does deliver in the genre, taking you on a roller coaster of emotions, in our opinion it does not do the story its due. It is fairly obvious why the film wasn't received too well and was not too popular, not even making up the half of its budget in worldwide sales."
" No redeeming qualities at all.
",2018-11-03 00:00:00,1,"Someone went to a lot of trouble to make IMHO the WORST waste of time ever. What in THE hell did I just watch? O_o
Other than that I got nothing."
" Gorgeous Visuals and That Is Enough.
",2018-11-01 00:00:00,8,"Okay, the story isn't much. There is a story for sure but it's very straightforward, fashion industry is cruel. It shows how models can go above and beyond to be successful or keep on being successful and looks isn't a mirror to what's inside. Although people may understand many things or nothing from this movie but that is how I perceived it.
.
You will find many bad reviews about this simply because people chose to watch a movie that they expected differently in my opinion. This movie doesn't sell itself to be a story driven thriller whatsoever, or action movie. This movie is a movie that is made purely to achieve outstanding, gorgeous visuals that will make your eyes bleed from beauty. It's one mesmerising shot after one.
.
There is bit of gore, disturbing scenes that includes cannibalism, necrophilia and fetishism. I definitely would define this movie as an erotica alongside with thriller. Erothriler? I personally love these movies, I'd put it in the same category with Raw and Dogtooth, which I loved. Weirdly and disturbing with a touch of ero.
.
~This type of movie kind of reminds me of old Giallo movies like Profondo Rosso (1975) and Suspiria (1977), which is getting a remake!!!!, so if you're into those movies that has lots of colour and eroticism and gore, I definitely recommend this movie."
" I think I liked it
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,7,The Neon Demon. A new film from the writer/director of Drive and Only God Forgives. A psychedelic headache of a film. God knows what it meant - probably a satire on the female modelling industry. Visually stunning. I think I quite liked it. 7 out of ten
" 21st century Argento
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,10,"Loved it! If Argento would still be making good movies - this would be smth the master of Italian horror would've made! Cold, heartless, dark world of fashion business with a dark & twisted ending."
" Disgusting
",2018-09-29 00:00:00,1,If I was in a Cinema I would have walked out. In fact I would even give it a star at all. I wish I could un watch the part of the movie I already had.
" All of the questions and none of the answers
",2018-09-27 00:00:00,1,"Slow like Drive, but without the suspense or Ryan Gosling. All I could think of was 'Where are they going with this?' ... 'How does that link to that?' ... 'What is the message they're attempting to convey?' ... 'Surely an eyeball gobstopper would be tasty enough?'... 'Yuck that really is some morbid molestation' and 'Is that really the ending?' Fml."
" What a load of ****
",2018-09-22 00:00:00,1,"Slow, boring, with a nothing ending. I read reviews saying this movie was disturbing. The most disturbing part was the slooooooow storyline with lots of pointless scenes. Wish I'd picked a different movie! Waste of 2 hours of my life!"
" Neon Demon 6/10 Beautifully shot but so forgetful!!!!
",2018-09-05 00:00:00,6,"I haven't watched this movie in a year. I bought this film on DVD back in 2016. Watched it last spring and loved it. However, recently I watched it again. I ended up hating the movie because I forgot how boring the movie is. The plot makes no sense and I don't understand why the models are obsessed with blood. The cinematography is beautiful but the movie is worried about looking good instead if telling a good story. The director of this movie should just direct music videos because this movie is a nearly 2 hour music video! This film is made as an excuse to include lesbian sex scenes. I'm not homophobic. I hated when the jealous models killed off Elle Fanning's character! She didn't deserve to die! Those jealous models should've died! The ending is so stupid! I understand why this movie received mixed reviews. If you're curious about this movie just rent it. Don't expect anything good. This film wasted Elle Fanning's talent and character. We as the audience deserve better movies!"
" Nothing under the skin
",2018-08-13 00:00:00,1,"The ego of Nicola Winding Refn, or ""NWR"" as he's so happy to refer to himself in the opening credits, is absolutely out of control in this film.Sure, it's a film about the vacuous world of modelling, so why should we expect there to be any real substance? Because that's what makes for an interesting, engaging film. Personally, I have no idea how anyone can watch this, endure the awful, heavy-handed imagery, which is about as subtle as a sledge hammer, and think they're watching something arty or intelligent. This film so badly wants to be in the same league as Under The Skin, but it's not even playing the same sport. Please, don't waste your time, this film will spend the first hour or so teasing that it might be interesting or that there could be a story to be told, only to absolutely drop off a cliff in terms of quality and resort to really low levels in order to be edgy and provocative.If I could rate lower than a ""1"", I would."
" Not worth watching!
",2018-08-10 00:00:00,1,I'm wondering how it is possible to make such an awful film
" A unique, captivating and memorable film
",2018-08-06 00:00:00,8,"Nicolas Winding Refn has a way of making you feel inadequate when you watch his films - but in a good way. What I mean by that is that they're extremely complex and layered and even if you have a theory on a particular element of the film there's often no way to know if you're right. But isn't that great? Cinema that make you think is a thing of beauty. Of the three Refn films I have now seen ('Drive' and 'Only God Forgives' being the other two) I'd have to say 'The Neon Demon' is probably my favourite. Not by a wide margin, but it was certainly the one that I had the most fun watching. I honestly had no idea where the story was going to lead. I was trying to predict how it would pan out as the film went along, and to say I was way off would still be an understatement. The last 30 or so minutes of this film were so far out of left field, and yet so captivating, that I suspect I will remember them for a very long time.Even before that though the film had me hooked for the most part. The thing with Refn is that he creates these intricate and fascinating scenes, and yet you have no idea whether any of it is really important to the outcome or not. You hang on to every word though, both because it's interesting and because you know you may reflect on it in a very interesting way later on. Refn is notorious for his love of gore and violence and 'The Neon Demon' is no exception. It doesn't have perhaps the extreme levels that 'Only God Forgives' does (at least not in terms of what is actually shown), yet what is implied is still pretty horrifying. So there's no doubt this film won't be to everyones liking. Even if gore doesn't bother you I could see a lot of people simply not connecting with this film. Refn will always have a very much love/hate opinion held over his films I suspect. I enjoyed this one though a lot more than I even expected it to (it took me a long time to get around to seeing it because I had a feeling I was going to hate it). My advice would be to give it a chance and even if it's not your thing stick around to the end just to see what all the fuss is about."
" Not for everyone's taste.
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,9,"Some will say this movie is soulless trash, visually stunning but nothing inside, no story, no plot. And that is exactly what the movie is about. Outside beauty. It's superficial and the person, as some of the characters you'll come across in ""The Neon Demon"", might be dead inside. Beauty is depicted through the characters, lightning, with every camera angle, through the whole atmosphere which will leave you feeling empty. Even the conversations they have are regarding beauty. The movie is about the inner ugliness of the people surrounding our protagonist - Jesse, how she copes with it and how she is devoured by the beauty world by giving into it. I do agree that this movie has nothing new to say, but by that analogy all the movies have nothing new to say. Every movie is about things we come across in every day life, of course not to the extent the movies show it. I guess the bad reviews are from hasty, unpatient people that like action movies where good plot is concidered ""Uugh, my wife/kid/dog got killed! I'm gonna spend the next hour killing and destroying!"" Nicolas Winding Refn takes his time with his scenes and if you're in a hurry, go watch Mission Impossible or something similar to that kind."
" 3 stars just for the imagery
",2018-08-01 00:00:00,3,"Too little substance, too much embellishment. The story is boring & does not achieve what it wants to. Visually stunning."
" Lesbian Necrophilia Cannibal Apocalipse

" Just Weird
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,1,"I hated this movie!!!! It was complete trash and weird. I would not recommend this because it is just disturbing and weird. A lot of people are gonna be like ""omg how is this movie disturbing"" BUT HAVE YOU SEEN IT!!! That witch girl Ruby literally tries to RAPE Jessie like OMG!!!!! A 30 LADY TRYING TO RAPE A YOUNG 16 YEAR OLD GIRL!!!! That's just disgusting! Then she makes out and tries to have you know what with A DEAD BODY OF A YOUNG GIRL!!! Ruby just imagines that it's Jessie but it's not and because Jessie doesn't like her like that, SHE PRETENDS THE DEAD GIRL IS JESSIE AND TRIES TO HAVE YOU KNOW WHAT WITH IT!! I gagged at it like seriously, who would even do that. Who comes up with this stuff and why would they do it? What person would ever think of having this in a movie? When Ruby pushes Jessie into the pool with no water, she doesn't die, UNTIL THOSE WITCH GIRLS EAT HER LIKE OMG THEY ARE CANNIBALS. Sarah, Gigi and Ruby eat Jessie so they can have natural beauty and get more modelling gigs. Well that does happen.This girl named Amber gets fired and Sarah replaces her. Gigi is also doing to modelling gig with Sarah and their standing in front of a pool. Gigi starts feeling sick and goes to the bathroom and vomits up Jessie's eyeball. Gigi kills herself so she doesn't need to feel sick anymore because she need to get Jessie's body out of her. Sarah then pick up the eyeball and EATS IT LIKE OMG OMG OMG!!! That's the end and I hope I never see this movie again. I'm not gonna watch it so yeah"
" Not a Movie, Rather an Experience
",2018-07-08 00:00:00,8,"The movie Dogtooth directed by Yorgos Lanthimos and this movie both have some things in common. Not only are they both movies that are very abstract in their production, but they are also both movies that I would describe as experiences rather than films. My reasoning for this is somewhat hard to explain, but it mainly boils down to the fact that both films present a string of events, presented in a very ""realistic"" (I use this term referring to the shots and dialogue, not at all with the content being presented) manner. This movie was outstanding in terms of visuals, and my god, the soundtrack was phenomenal and added much needed suspense to some moments in the movie that might have suffered without it. The acting in this movie was great as far as the main characters and Keanu Reeve's character go, however, there were a few side characters that I believed did not deliver their lines so convincingly. However, they are side characters and as a result did not draw me out of the movie too often. The story of this movie honestly did not have a lot going on, but again, as with Dogtooth, I believe that is kind of the point. Nicolas Winding Refn is too good of a director and writer to just accidentally present a film with little story. I believe this was done on purpose for this movie, to make it play out, like I said before as an experience. The movie also makes some surprisingly great social commentary on beauty and human nature itself. I have no idea why this movie has ""horror"" as its first genre, as the movie was not horrifying at all in my opinion. However, I do agree that this movie is a thriller, Refn takes the audience on a ride, winding up the coils of suspense until he just releases the coils and lets everything fly, referring to that crazy ending of course. The strangest and perhaps most intriguing thing about this movie to me was the fact that even though the ending was absolutely insane, it did not seem out of place at all in terms of the movie's universe. Even though the universe at first was presented as very realistic, as the movie went on you could feel the reality start to slip as if Refn had been slowly pulling a rug out from under you. This movie was fantastic, although there were a few flaws, and I do not believe I have the desire to watch it again, it is definitely a thrilling, visually compelling, smart ride that will have you holding on for your life as the credits roll."
" Not for Everyone, But...
",2018-06-26 00:00:00,10,"I'm glad I took the chance to watch this despite the ratings. I really enjoyed it, and have seen it a few times now. It is abstract and has a pretty simple message about the issues with vanity and the modeling industry specifically. But personally, I found it entertaining and the acting was on point from all the actors / actresses. Keanu Reeves did a great job; his character was horrible yet hilarious at the same time.POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEADThere's pretty much one sane character (the amateur photographer) and everyone else is psycho or becomes corrupted in some way. But the characters were pretty interesting. There were a lot of strange things that were a bit ""what...?"", but it worked for a more abstract film. I also think it was clever how the woman who warned Jesse at the beginning to watch out for the male photographer and that ""it's good to have good girls around"" was ultimately the one who was the worst psycho of all."
" Got Weird?
",2018-06-14 00:00:00,7,"The Neon Demon, what can you say. It is very chic and sleek in it's images, and it's very saturated in Neon, so it's not just a clever name. The music score is phenomenal and Refn definitely has an eye for something, but like Only God Forgives, I have no clue what this film was about. Yet I liked it, kind of sort of. Perhaps Refn doesn't know what the film is about either. Maybe he just put it out there like a work of art for the viewing public to subjectively give their opinion on. Who knows. In the end there is no movie quite like The Neon Demon. It's most definitely one of a kind."
" David Lynch for millennials - pretentious and VERY boring
",2018-06-12 00:00:00,1,"Most of the time, absolutely NOTHING happens in this flick. And when something finally does happen, it either makes no sense whatsoever and/or is completely ludicrous (not in an amusing way).Although technically well executed, I find the visual style pretentious and tacky and I'd say the same about the soundtrack.It's almost as if the idea was to make a David Lynch flick for millennials: brightly colored, empty, meaningless drivel covered up with a sauce of faux deep symbolism and some ""edgy"" violence & sex for shock value.The director surely was happy to just make a buck and get away with it all. If you were to compliment him on his work, I think he would find you stupid."
" Terrible
",2018-06-10 00:00:00,1,"I find this film incredibly ironic, as it tries to showcase how focussing on shallow, aesthetics without substance can be poisonous; while being shallow and focussing on aesthetics without any substance. There is no depth to a very weak story, as well as including very random, arty, surrealist scenes that made absolutely no sense to anything else in the film which made it fractured and gave it a sense of stupidity. Way too pretentious for my taste, but if you are into ponce then you'll love this."
" Vapid, nonsensical film
",2018-06-02 00:00:00,4,"Any stars I can give this film will be for some of the visually interesting scenes and some decent music. Unfortunately that's all there really is to it. The content, so to speak, is utterly dull and uninspired. I saw an interview with Refn where he basically sums up this film as being about ""what it would be like to be born beautiful."" This is a well-worn theme and he does very little to expand upon it beyond introducing this tacked-on ""witchcraft"" element. The acting is mostly not that great either. I have liked a lot of his other work but I cannot recommend this film."
" Beautiful but Vague
",2018-05-31 00:00:00,8,"The Neon Demon is simply about a beautiful young country girl moving to a big city, because she thinks she can make it in the modelling industry. Not only is the cinematography on of the greatest I've ever seen, in any movie, but the acting is also amazing. Elle Fanning is great as the lead but the show was stolen by Jena Malone as Ruby. Desmond Harrington and Charles Baker also have amazing scenes. The Neon Demon unravels the inner happenings of the modelling industry and what females in the industry deal with. The main theme throughout the movie is beauty. What natural beauty can get you and actions other people will undertake to achieve that beauty, changing the way they look or ""becoming plastic people"". This is explored well and is an interesting case study into the modelling industry.This deep look into themes puts the character arcs out of focus and it creates a very straightforward reason for all the characters, showing not much emotion or depth. The dialogue is also forgettable. The main negative with this film is all the unnecessary gore and horror. Even though thats the directors signature the movie can be just as powerful without the gore. Refn's love for horror and fetish should not trump the overall quality of the movie.This movie is a visual masterpiece, giving the audience mostly visual storytelling techniques. Some people may not grasp this movie and just find it boring. The Neon Demon is only for people who enjoy arty films or are intelligent enough to grasp the concepts presented."
" Good plot
",2018-05-31 00:00:00,5,"Viewed at May, 29 2018 - was a good plot but really difficult to understand the metaphors during the movie .... great photos direction!"
" All style, no substance
",2018-05-30 00:00:00,3,"This movie is the Odyssey 2001 of model movies. Very long unedited shots that do not add anything to the story except time. Many 'visually appealing' lights and backgrounds that again does not add to story. Story itself is extremely slow giving the impression of a high payoff...it never happens. Make matters worse, movie just ends without any explanation of what happened or why. This is not a horror movie at all and barely delivers as a thriller."
" The unintended couple of laughs are not worth it
",2018-05-26 00:00:00,1,"It's an accidental comedy in one or two scenes. 
Nothing artful about it at all. Not even really visually stunning like some claim.
It's about as visually stunning as a cotton candy bloated dizzy carnival nightmare.
Yea, I'm pretty sure this is the worst movie I've seen in a good long time."
" Odd, but good
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,7,"It was a colorful, but brutal story of a woman who wants to be a model and stage actress, but is constantly bullied by three women who are jealous of her beauty and wish to be her by any means necessary. I would've liked it more it the final 20 minutes wasn't so nasty. It was a gruesome finale, but it was mostly suspenseful and entertaining."
" Feast Your Eyes.
",2018-05-17 00:00:00,5,"Somebody is presumably being killed, and Jesse didn't know who to call, so, she calls someone who can provide absolutely zero help or protection for the person in danger. Too bad Wyclef Jeans ""Someone please call 911"" wasn't playing somewhere within all these dreams and visions we were subjected to. But, that's the thing with ""art"" films I guess; logic or reasoning isn't really the primary goal or defining characteristic.This films' payoff is actually pretty amazing, however sadly, it being attached to a body of work about as powerful as an atrophied arm swinging in zero gravity, meant its punch was almost unrecognizable and could've easily been mistaken for a baby fist bump.Also, Elle Fanning isn't nearly as pretty as one would need to be to play the character she's supposed to be portraying. Perhaps this may not mean anything in the grand scheme of things, but given the subject matter, I feel that maybe, it may just mean everything.The Photography is quite stunning, the performances were on and off like flickering neon lights, and the character development and handling was depicted well enough for almost all except the lead while the script had some moments of merit. The Neon Demon had some beams of light, without much shine. 5/10."
" Painful
",2018-05-09 00:00:00,1,"Horrifically boring. Waiting for some dialogue, something interesting to happen. Trying to find a character to like. Just dead. The biggest question is How the hell did Keanu Reeves get mixed up in this garbage?"
" Attention all horror/thriller fans!...
",2018-04-24 00:00:00,1,"There are no thrills and the only horror is the fact that I sat through this entire movie hoping for a redeeming quality. This ""movie"" has no plot, no dialogue and makes no sense. That's a couple hours of my life that I will never get back. How they managed to get any known actors to take part in this is far beyond my ability to comprehend. Do yourself a favor and watch some late night QVC-you'll get more out of it than you will by watching this film."
" One of the strangest movies I've ever seen - and I'm okay with that!
",2018-03-28 00:00:00,7,"Going into this film, I didn't truly know what to expect. All I knew was that the promotional images really captured my attention, due to the pretty colors, with up-and-coming actress, Elle Fanning in the center. A ""nymphet"" Tumblr blog I follow also re-blogged images from this. It's some kind of horror (I read the sex/nudity descriptions in the parental guidance section here prior to viewing) that has very mixed reviews.Much of the the first two acts is relatively slow and realistic. It's got great visuals, despite two scenes with annoying flashing lights. The trip-hop soundtrack by Cliff Martinez is also ear-catching. But, boy, was I not expecting such a final act! Thinking back on it, there's a decent amount of foreshadowing leading up to it. As the track titled, ""Are We Having a Party"" played over, my eyes were widened as I realized what had happened to Jesse (Fanning). In spite of its disturbing aspects (notably, a scene involving necrophilia), I ended up really liking The Neon Demon. I appreciate how it chose to make audiences uncomfortable rather than the usual ""lesbianism is hot~"" excuse (ie Birdman). There are critics who hate and/or have called this misogynistic, and I can completely understand why; but that doesn't wane my enjoyment of it. On the official movie discussion on Reddit, users have called this ""David Lynch meets Black Swan,"" which I also happen to agree with.It was great to see Abbey Kershaw on-screen again after her debut in Mad Max: Fury Road - also kind of funny her playing an aspiring model, considering she already works as one in real-life; can't wait to see what else she and Fanning have to offer in future projects!Learning that the director, Nicholas Refn, was born colorblind is very surprising, since his movies are so awashed with vivid colors. I'm planning on watching Only God Forgives and Drive next (the latter generally being considered his best work)."
" This is a polarising film
",2018-03-27 00:00:00,8,"I've watched this for the second time after seeing Starry eyes. Both are very similar however the latter is a bit more amateur. This film has more start power, excellent cinematography, better music (of course, for Refn film), beautiful styling, and a pretty good story. The 2 ""mean"" models are great - and they are both aussies. I really liked this film however it loses its way a bit when the main character does ""the Show,"" that part was a bit derivative of Black Swan, however it wasnt done as well, so its a bit hard to tell what causes the main characters ""transformation."" Very twisted and very enjoyable. Great acting, Keanu Reeves was a nasty highlight...."
" ATTEMPT TO COPY DARIO ARGENTO'S SUSPIRA
",2018-03-22 00:00:00,7,"Suspira is a visually sumptuous experience with incredible audio, a film to immerse yourself in. Neon Demon has tried to replicate the style, music and even theme of Suspira. It is a passible attempt but falls way short.
The colour saturation; dominant haunting music; long corridor & door shots; long slow non-action; vampires replacing witches; lesbian theme - these all reflect Suspira.
Enjoy this film but for a special experience watch the original."

There are long periods of nothing in the movie which adds to the slowness. I have seen Elle Fanning in other things and she is better than this movie.

Plus side the sound and music was pretty cool as well as some of the effects but I would never watch this again."

The film has around 3 locations in which it is set, all of which are filmed in silence, or with dull, bass heavy music as it tries to match the edgi-ness of 'Drive' (it does NOT succeed.)I genuinely think that the screenplay could have been written within an hour.. by a child. Unfortunately, the lowest rating I could give was a 1. Which I must say, is generous. Don't be fooled by the appearance of Keanu Reeves, it seems he was hired to simply boost the advertising for the project. He appears around twice and only manages to mutter a few lines before jamming his knife in Elle Fanning's mouth. Which, (obviously) made no sense and had no relevance to the shambles of a storyline.If you're wanting to see all of the action, watch the last 10 minutes. I can assure you that you won't need to watch the first hour and fifty minutes. It probably won't make sense anyway. Anyhow, the cinematography was good. Or should I say photography? The film is slow. So, extraordinarily slow. If it was filmed at a normal pace, and all the lines were spoken together, you'd barely have enough footage to compile a movie trailer. I'm begging you, save yourself. Go watch Drive instead."
" The Cinematic Equivalent of Vanity
",2018-02-26 00:00:00,9,"It does my heart good to know that a movie like The Neon Demon can still get a wide release in the United States. I'll be the first to admit my tendency towards pessimism regarding the current state of our film industry, especially when it comes to true creative freedom. But the fact that I can hop in my car, take a 10 minute drive to my local Regal Cinemas, and watch a movie as uncompromising and unique as this - with ""Amazon Studios"" plastered on it, no less - gives me hope. The fact that I was one of exactly five people in the theater on opening Saturday night? Let's not talk about that part.The film follows Jesse (Elle Fanning) - a beautiful, virginal (figuratively and literally), and possibly orphaned (the backstory is vague) 15-year-old girl who has recently moved to LA in pursuit of a career in modeling. Essentially, we watch as Jesse is slowly sucked in by the superficial glitz and glam of the industry, chewed up, and eventually swallowed whole as the film becomes increasingly bizarre and abstract.At its core, The Neon Demon is a film about vanity; it's a film about the vacuous existence that results from a single-minded obsession with appearance. It's certainly not a unique idea, but the success of the film is that it isn't just about vanity, it embodies vanity.Many have praised the visual prowess of this film and I'll wholeheartedly echo that - it is unbelievably beautiful and easily one of the most visually striking movies I have ever seen. There is an obsessive attention to detail in every single frame: the lighting, shot composition, set design, color palate - you name it - are all finely tuned to create an incredibly sumptuous, nearly sublime visual experience.But at the same time, the film feels incredibly empty. Much of it takes place in big, wide-open spaces sparsely populated by women who take up just about as little horizontal space as humanly possible. Many scenes - interestingly, often those with dialogue - feel extremely quiet as monotonic characters lethargically converse with intermittent moments of near-silence between each statement and response. And, of course, many of the film's scenes find its characters simply gazing wordlessly at themselves and others, completely lost in the allure of their perceived beauty.The polarized response to the film is definitely unsurprising. By its own design it feels empty, emotionless, and artificial. The characters in the film and the world they inhabit don't feel real; they are personifications of vanity - vampires who feed on beauty rather than blood. To enjoy the film isn't really to identify with its characters or connect emotionally, but to marvel at how wholly and successfully it captures the essence of superficiality and vanity. The brilliant crux of the film is that the pleasure derived from it by those like me who enjoyed it comes directly from the same deep-seated, mesmeric attraction to beauty that the characters in the film embody. Not unlike what Haneke accomplished with Funny Games (another polarizing film) and his commentary on the ""torture porn"" genre, Refn slyly exposes the audience for their moth-to-flame affinity for beauty, regardless of how superficial it may be.However, while the main appeal of the film is certainly (and fully intentionally) the visual style, there definitely is subtlety and depth to the proceedings which bolster it as well. Jesse's character arc is quite frank - at the outset she's a naïve, relatively unassuming and hesitant girl who is slowly ""consumed"" by the glitz of the industry and ultimately becomes as self-absorbed and delusional as the veteran models who surround her. It's the manner in which this transformation occurs, however, that is quite well-executed and subtle: flattery. She's surrounded by people in LA who universally faun over her, call her special, tell her she will be the next big thing, etc. Through a series of ever-so-subtle positive reactions to this repeated flattery (portrayed very well by Fanning), we watch as all of the praise and attention infiltrates and corrupts Jesse's mind, culminating in a hallucinatory, abstract turning point during a runway show where she becomes fully taken by lust for her own beauty, kissing her reflection on either side of a triangular mirror. She becomes her own worst enemy. Though obviously taken to an extreme in the film, this is a trajectory we see all the time with child stars whose fame inflates their ego to a breaking point from which they spiral downward. And Fanning's performance combined with Refn's direction deftly captures the subtlety of such a transition and how it can be provoked by something as innocent as a compliment.Also, while many of the characters - particularly the rival models - are thinly drawn (and intentionally so), I found the other main character of the film, Ruby (Jena Malone) to be quite interesting as well. She's a makeup artist - most likely a failed model - who rubs elbows with the elite models of the industry but is clearly an outsider and fully aware of that fact. She's pretty, and clearly just as preoccupied with beauty as the rest, but also painfully aware that she just doesn't quite have the looks to make it in the industry. So instead she does the makeup, surrounding herself with her more beautiful counterparts motivated both by envy and physical attraction. She gets as close to the life as she possibly can without being able to live it herself. This theme is very effectively driven home by her role as a ""house sitter"" later on in the movie - caretaking in the home of a wealthier, more successful individual, watering the plants, living the life but at the same time not living it at all. It's all a fantasy fueled by her desire to be something that she just isn't. Her character feels like a vehicle for commentary on the detrimental effects of a society so hyper-focused on appearance - those who don't meet the standard almost inevitably feel discluded and inadequate.As far as criticism goes, the themes of the film can definitely be a bit heavy-handed at times. Also, on an initial viewing I will say that the third act of the film left me wanting a bit more. Looking back on the full arc I do appreciate the ending, but there was definitely a bit of a tonal shift where the film began to feel a little cartoony, particularly in the very final scenes. It's a minor criticism, as the film certainly is already quite detached from reality and the cartoony elements really just augment this quality and bring it out in full view at the close. Still, I couldn't help but want a little more as the credits started to roll (although, to be fair, it's also partially because I didn't want to the film to end).Bravo to Amazon for helping to produce this film. This was the very first film I have seen with ""Amazon Studios"" labeled on the front, and I applaud them for putting their name on a project so uncompromisingly artistic and with very little universal appeal. Regardless of whether you enjoyed the film, I think we can agree that such a huge company supporting and advertising an auteur film like this is a huge win for film lovers.Decent 4.5/5"
" This movie is pure garbage
",2018-02-03 00:00:00,1,"There´s no story. Almost all actors performances are mediocre. Elle Fanning is just a pretty face, but her acting is like of a plastic doll. The music is just horrible all the time.The only sign of life in this movie was Jena Malone, but even her couldn´t perform like she is used to do. It´s a real shame a film like this even get out from the director´s mind. It deserves to be locked in a dark corner at his brain and never see the light of day."
" An Art Film.

" The Neon Demon
",2018-01-03 00:00:00,7,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerWord of Warning: The Neon Demon has a very complex story that contains a lot of symbolism. At first this film might be hard to follow and understand. I would recommend watching it and then look up an explanation guide on YouTube. The film gets extremely dark, gory, sexual, and plain out weird towards the end. With all that said, the story is extremely dark. The film holds a very eerie and surreal tone. Like I said before, the story is very complex, confusing, and difficult to understand. After a second viewing, I understood mostly everything but still looked up an explanation guide to further clarify. The acting at times can seem inconsistent. Especially in the case Elle Fanning's character Jesse. But the inconsistency is there for a reason. Without spoiling anything, her personality changes when she comes to terms with her true beauty. Keanu Reeves delivers the weakest performance. His character is very dry and has no depth. The amount of symbolism throughout the film is astounding. The two main symbols to look out for are beauty and the triangle.The film is slightly overlong. The film itself is about two hours, but could have been about an hour and a half.The film has a perfect blend of nudity and violence. All of the scenes that involved nudity or violence were there for a reason in order to further the symbolism and depth of the characters. Pros: Complex and dark story, consistent tone, good acting, perfect blend of nudity and violence, and a great use of symbolismCons: Keanu Reeves' dry performance, can be a difficult story to follow, and an overly long runtime Overall Rating: 7.4/10P.S. Nicolas Winding Refn's most notable films are Drive (2011) and Bronson (2008) which I would highly recommend. Also, if you really enjoyed The Neon Demon you might also enjoy Only God Forgives (2013) which was also created by Refn."
" Not good
",2017-12-29 00:00:00,3,"A friend of mine recommended this film to me, so I watched it expecting nothing in particular. In regard to this movie all I have to say s that it fells like a bad joke, the story is flat, characters are underdeveloped and lack motivation, in other words it feels like a waste of time."
" Amazingly beautiful and sharp satire -- a masterpiece
",2017-11-04 00:00:00,10,"With ""The Neon Demon"" (2016), Danish provocateur Nicolas Winding Refn has created a masterpiece. It's a dark satire and not for everyone.Having been harshly criticised for its portrayal of females and the female body, and accused of sexism, the strength of Winding Refn's work, co-written with Mary Laws and Polly Stenham, is the subtle but ingenious way it exposes and ridicules the unsound and destructive view and treatment of women in today's society, in particular in the world of modelling, acting and singing. Benefitting largely from the breathtaking, powerful, creative, beautiful and ferociously skilled cinematography by Natasha Braier (one of very few female cinematographers), the film also has an aesthetic quality that reaches far beyond mainstream filmmaking. Adding to this the fine score by composer Cliff Martinez, the audiovisual experience grows even more. ""The Neon Demon"" is an example of truly great cinema and the work of a great artist with a visionary originality rarely seen. Nicolas Winding Refn, thank you! Please, never stop doing your thing."
" One of the worst films I've seen
",2017-11-02 00:00:00,2,"This is two hours of striking images, with pretensions of being a story. The only reason the rating is as high as it is is that there seems to be some kind of consensus that Nicolas Winding Refn is some kind of genius. He knows how to make the image on screen look good. That's all. He's no story-teller, and this movie exposes the fact more than any other. There's no substance here. The story and dialogue are on par with Showgirls, but with less going on and long stretches of nothing happening but we're supposed to just look at meaningless compositions the whole time. It's like a two-hour music video with almost no music.Even the praise I've seen offers nothing more than that it has some nice imagery or that it's 'different'. Not enough to make a movie work. Avoid, or you'll regret it."
" An Airy Yet Vicious Satire of All-Consuming Vanity
",2017-10-29 00:00:00,9,"""The Neon Demon"" is a film of mesmerizing aesthetic brilliance, but one which also contains visceral depravity. This makes it highly similar to much of Nicolas Winding Refn's other work. What sets this film apart is its unsettling hollowness. Its lack of emotional attachment. Its lack of a traditionally satisfying narrative. Many critics have invoked the dubious criticism of ""style over substance"" in order to attack these elements of the film. But is style itself not the ultimate substance in a film which is altogether about the obsessive depths of vanity? As I see it, that hollowness is very much by design. With that said, ""The Neon Demon"" is most definitely not something that everyone will enjoy, so tread with caution.The film is frequently quite extreme in its imagery and visual metaphors, particularly with its infamously disgusting ending. For this reason, it can perhaps be classified as an exceptionally slick and beautiful exploitation film, albeit one with many subtleties to it and which moves at a slow, confident pace. At no point do the exploitative elements feel cheap, even when they feel excessive. Jena Malone's incredible performance as Ruby is perhaps the best example of this subtle/extreme dichotomy. She remains disconcertingly calm, soft-spoken, and amiable, yet she is also a terrifying enigma, full of menace and dread, capable of bizarre, disturbing acts. The characters of Gigi and Sarah are similarly threatening in relation to Elle Fanning's Jesse, who anchors the insanity in a simple tale of innocence encountering for the first time that which preys upon it. Will she overcome it, embrace it, be consumed by it, or paradoxically all of the above?One criticism I had was that a few of the extraneous characters such as Hank, the character played by Keanu Reeves, seem underutilized. Hank, aside from being yet another menace for Jesse to avoid, doesn't do much. My best guess is that he serves as a way to juxtapose the masculine and the feminine, the two different types of threats that Jesse encounters both seeking to use her in their own selfish way. Ideally this would be a bit clearer.Ultimately, though it is an unusual film, I don't think it is one which needs to be heavily analyzed in order to be understood or enjoyed. However, if you do decide to check it out, make sure you are prepared for just how bizarre and shocking it can be. In a twisted way, you just might find it to your liking."
" Pretentious waste of time & effort
",2017-10-22 00:00:00,1,"If you see this crap you will understand why the audience reacted by booing, throwing things at the screen, making farting noises and leaving in droves. This film has every perverted fetish you don't want to see. There are literally scenes that go on for 5 minutes with no dialogue and nothing happens---actors just stand & stare at the camera. This ""film"" is a bad joke."
" Boredom is a killer
",2017-10-22 00:00:00,3,"Jesse is a 16 year old aspiring model who just arrived in LA and is living in some filthy motel. We meet her during a shoot, where's she's made up to look like a dead mannequin for a sinister-looking photographer.After the shoot she meets the friendly Ruby, a make-up artists who is fascinated by Jesse's innocence. She invites her to a party where we meet two attractive models, Gigi and Sarah. One of them, who knows which one, is a just a mean b@#$% the other one is friendly until Jesse questions her obsession with plastic surgery.Next Jesse is interviewed by a modeling agency. For unknown reasons, the agent is awe-struck by her. She's hired for some shoot with a famous but bored photographer. Again, we are led to believe this guy has some very bad motives, but he doesn't.There are some pointless scenes at the motel, and as a result Jesse has to spend some nights with Ruby who also works doing makeup at a mortuary.Things improve dramatically for Jesse when she's cast for some runway show by a fashion designer, who again, for no good reason, finds the dull Jesse fantastic for some reason. And there Jesse is chosen over on her two more attractive friend-models.This is a turning-point for Jesse, because now her good fortunes go to her head. She's been dating some equally innocent guy but Jesse's new-found arrogance puts an end to it. And it will also get her in trouble with Ruby and the other girls.The Neon Demon is one long dull movie. Just like its characters it's empty but offers superficially something to see. And I guess some people did fall for the visuals. I didn't. I found this movie visually obnoxious and ugly. Not a single second or scene was stunning or striking or special. The movie is visually exceedingly dark, with some unreal neon-like blues and reds. Big deal. I didn't care for it at all.Story-wise, there's not much here either. Yeah, the innocent young model arriving in the lion's den of LA. How original. And everything here is presented as being nothing but menacing. There are the sinister photographers, the violent motel manager, a mountain lion attack (!?), huge egos. Even Ruby is presented as some predator surrounding Jesse when in fact she turns out to be quite helpful and kind, till the final scenes of course.What was surprising was the horror aspect. That I didn't expect, mainly because I had given up on this movie long before the horror starts. This movie is after all a tedious drag. Every scene is filmed in slow motion and during most of the movie there is no motion at all. Sure there's the synth music which has become fashionable with retro-themed movies. Except that The Neon Demon isn't even retro-themed. But here it doesn't complement the movie, rather it seems out of place.I'll give this movie 3 stars for the daring horror and nudity. There's nothing else worthwhile here. The fast-forward button is your friend here. This movie is so empty that it allows for all sorts of interpretations, as other reviewers have done. But this is one of those movies that's so bad, I had no interest in looking for meaning nor do I want to put in the effort to try to interpret it."
" Visually appealing, if cluttered movie.
",2017-10-18 00:00:00,7,"NO spoilers here.Visually, this movie is 10/10. The cinematography is absolutely world class. Moreover the protagonist and main antagonists are all deliciously gorgeous.The protagonist is magnificently innocent and initially unaware of her own beauty and the antagonists, especially are painted fantastically as the shallow, self-absorbed mess, obsessive-compulsive behaviour that epitomises the life as a model.Moreover, the uneasy mood, ragged pacing and uncertain, random story meanderings create an unsettling atmosphere that will leave one expecting an equally remarkable plot.Unfortunately, that his where this film fails to deliver. For all its incredible imagery, the plot is a little too pedestrian even if not entirely predictable.This movie is a feast for the eyes but offers somewhat less in the way of mental and emotional nourishment.Still, a worthy, sumptuously guilty visual pleasure so long as you're not expecting Cronenberg level horror-craft."
" Beauty isn't everything. It is the only thing.

Everyone loves the overly pale Jesse who ""has that thing."" She is ""a diamond in a sea of glass."" She stays in a sleazy motel which provides a few WTF moments, with Keanu Reeves playing the motel owner. Jesse claims she ""is not as helpless as she looks"" and the film turns weird after an hour or so and continues to go down a path until you don't have closure. Okay. It's a metaphor.The film seems to be making a statement about the fashion industry and 15 minutes of fame every nubile gets until they turn 20-ish and there is always one coming along, same as the old one. They used real models as extras. I could have gone four stars had they cast Susan Dey (is she still alive?) as the casting director. I think that would have made for a stronger message.

The Result: What a disappointment!

" Perfection through the death of naturalness
",2017-09-26 00:00:00,8,"Luxuria, Glamor, Envy, Perfection, Ego, Narcissism and more ... ""Demon of Neon"" finds the point and explores the world of perfect human beings, where naturalness shocks, and robotic is accepted, where perfection can be reflected in the mirror and where ""everything that the human being has, is its beauty"", this is the world of the film of director Nicolas Refn, a film under-appreciated by criticism and by the public, which tells a sarcastically sensational and a beautiful technical and visual. The plot of the film has a simple premise, and focuses on a linearity and the character of Jesse, but with the course, the secondary characters are gaining strength until finally steal the film. A kind of ""Black Swan"" on the contrary, because here our protagonist is already perfect, and the others around her who seek this perfection in her, with an air David Lynch and using subjectivity, ""Demon Neon"" is a spectacle, entering as far as possible into the human ego it shows that perfection goes beyond the very concept of humanity, and the search delimits the character and submits decency to nothing, the long produces and shows a world where what really counts is appearances , and he does not have to do it with dialogues, he says it in small details, like the make-up that Jesse is wearing in his moment of ""change,"" or in his parade where she kisses her appearance in a metaphor of marriage to herself, the film uses a variety of script resources, from this dialogue to subjectivity to show its idea, and after a while this becomes so natural, that Nicolas begins to introduce elements of pure savagery, such as rape, cannibalism, murder and even necrophilia, shocking? no, not at all, the shocking thing is the human indifference to savagery when your goal is to be perfect and your lust wipes out your humanity. The film technically is a very detailed, with a camera always searching the center, and a photograph that plays with games of lights, reflecting the climate of the scene, although at times, it seems that Nicolas plays with the photography of random way but nevertheless , is a very beautiful work, we also have a good track, good set that gives a very good rhythm to the film, even the same being sometimes very contemplative, a great makeup and costumes, technically, ""Devil De Neon"" is pure whim, and it's one of the most technically beautiful thriller movies I've ever seen. Elle Fannng is great in her role, and can pass the tone of innocent girl and bad girl when it is necessary, Jena Malone tabem is giant, beautiful and passing a hidden air, her character is the synthesis of the doubt, she wants the carnal perfection and sentimental, at the same time that the two are in conflict, the other actresses are robotic, even in their postures at the table, and this is not bad, is great, which proves that has no weakness in the cast. ""De Neon"" is not perfect, his moral that preaches a vision that nothing can be perfect and natural for a long time proves itself in the evaluation of the film, he can be perfect in some aspects, but his naturalness dies, and sometimes it is even a little forced, but it is still a great movie and a psychological suspense of quality, with questions, good technique, and great outcome, because this is the most dangerous thing in a movie, its end, it can ruin the work, and it seems that it will happen with ""Devil De Neon"", because it has a ready and great ending, there the film lengthens 2 more scenes, showing a final more than great, perfect, where perfection is reached, dead humanity and digested naturalness."

Jesse's new world is completely narcissistic and we learn how bold yet completely naive she is. Her first gig is organised with a prestigious, albeit creepy photographer who instantly makes everyone leave the room and asks her to remove her clothing – a raw and uncomfortable scene which really captures how men often take advantage of young women in the industry. This was one of many cringe-worthy moments (cue necrophilia and cannibalistic scenes) but at the same time, the film was so visually intoxicating. I left feeling divided – it was definitely a feast for the eyes but as far as storyline goes, a little confusing and underdeveloped."

Seeing a title like that made me think that it was a supernatural-based movie. After seeing a few trailers, I realized that it was anything but. So I put it on hold at my local library and sat down at night to watch it. If you happen to be under the influence of anything, do not watch this. The colors involved may make you ill. Without giving too much away, it is one movie that you may not want to watch over and over again. Once is enough to soak it all in and process the many nuances that Nicolas Winding Refn creates. After watching it just once, I will gladly admit that it made my head spin and almost sick to my stomach, which does not happen very often with me when it comes to watching horror movies.In truth, I must say that it is good without a shadow of a doubt. If you are not afraid of some subtle shock value, pursue this movie. It is unique unlike any other horror movie of its type and I guarantee that you will never see anything like it again."

I came here expecting to see the creators of this monstrosity dragged through the mud, but no, only a bunch of kool aid chugging zombies evidently disappointed that this demented, gruesome heap of trash has nothing intellectual to draw from. Well, who could have guessed? Hopefully somewhere beyond the first few pages of these reviews there will be a comment lamenting my thoughts which I will state here. First, In my opinion, tolerating this type of filth is an indication that the west has fallen to piteous lows. Something is seriously wrong with the minds of our society! A normal, healthy person should not feel remotely comfortable in watching a film fashionably portraying necrophilia, pedophilia, murder, and cannibalism. But then again, this imagery often attacks us in television, film, magazines, and music videos anyhow. I have zero plans on watching this movie, and came here solely to leave the comment I didn't see on any reviews so far. Even worse than the fact that this film was produced, is that there are automaton drones out there who watch something like this but think, ""It had no depth, it was only pretty lights and costumes, it had no critiques or commentary on the fashion industry and no grand revelation"". Is there any artistic merit to the brutalization of humanity? Of teenage girls? What kind of a demented person expects to find enlightenment or even entertainment in this material? Here. I will explain to you, in short terms, one of the many meanings behind neon demon, many of which are too detailed to describe here: to subvert the morals of society and brainwash the youth into adopting unbridled hedonistic, hellish behavior. They want humans to have no regard for each other, no understanding of empathy, no compassion, no intolerance for the worst types of degenerate behavior, which the devils in Hollywood/the most influential pockets of humanity readily participate in themselves. And they want you, the adult, to welcome it in open arms under the guise of ""art"". If you can't see that, it's no wonder you're grasping at straws trying to find any semblance of ""meaning"" in a film showing a woman molesting a dead body. SEEK HELP if you expect to find art in any such display.One day (and dozens of cultures like this have existed throughout human history, make NO mistake) we will wake up in a country whose youth thinks nothing of murder, beastiality, pedophilia, cannibalism, rape, intense physical abuse, etc, and you'll wonder how we got there."
" Overrated and pretentious
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,2,"This movie has beautiful scenes and thats it. It has no plot, no substance. I wonder why it is labeled as horror. It has blood and gore that seem to be there just to gross people out. I think the writer wanted to play with the contrast of beauty. I would not recommend it. THe movie is not well paced, is very boring and everything that happens makes no sense. People who enjoyed this movie are probably the ones who find the clothes of the king beautiful, when there are no clothes at all. Pretentious movie, zero content. The message the author wants to send could be done maybe in a short 15 minute youtube movie, it would make more sense."
" For the demented folks who lapped up the Necrophilia of BLISS . . .
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,5,". . . who got a Cheap Thrill watching a Fourth-Generation-Suicidal Dead-Girl-Walking in LIPSTICK, who banged on their Rhythm Boxes during LIQUID SKY, who saw ""Graphic Nudity"" with EYES WIDE SHUT, and who yearned to strut their Birthday Suits as READY TO WEAR outfits, NEON DEMON's tale of Young Cannibals with Weak Stomachs leads right down your Dark Alley. Red-blooded Normal Americans will see this Over-Rated Demonic Exercise for what it is: Kiddie Porn. Not since a Pre-Teen Brooke Shields infamously shared that bathtub with Susan Saranwrap as a PRETTY BABY has the American Ideal of Virginity been more thoroughly ravaged and raped than in this Pretentious Ode to Debauchery. Keanu Reeves may take LOLITA's name in vain here, but NEON DEMON is far LESS sensuous that Sissy Spacek's ""Plug it up!"" communal shower scene from the original CARRIE. It's high time that this Refn Bozo learn that there's a BIG difference between making a ""Horror Movie"" and extruding a ""Horrible Movie,"" since he pretty much specializes in churning out the latter!"
" 'A diamond in a sea of broken glass'
",2017-08-02 00:00:00,7,"The one cinematic influence on 'The Neon Demon' that is never mentioned - perhaps never generally observed before - is the uncanny way that Elle Fanning, as Jesse, is often shot as an evanescent but hypnotic creation conjured out of elaborate coloured lighting, make-up, setting and other lensed optical artefacts, in the manner of Clouzot's wildly kinetic portraiture of Romy Schneider in his abortive 'Inferno.' Clouzot gave himself a nervous breakdown and a heart attack trying to perfect this experimental cinematic device, and neither he nor his career recovered. There is a very good and detailed documentary about this unfinished film. I am sure 'Inferno''s evocation of predatory lust and its dangerous perversions is a major influence on the ferally prowling gaze and motion of this film by Refn, and that the intensely caressing yet lubricious, even droolingly all-consuming, radically transforming, obsessively superficial and disturbingly shifting gaze is channeling the extraordinary surviving snippets of Schneider turned into a puppet or an abstracted icon of totally objectified, possessed and possessive, stalking, sinisterly beautiful light. Refn has bolstered Clouzot's unstable and imperfectly-realised visions with Argento's robustly exploitative distortions of reality, and Kubrick's chilly and cynical humour, to produce a stylish Grand Guignol vision of the inhumanity and feral lusts literally prowling the catwalk, with ruthless ambition as the driving hunger. Everything possesses a dangerous sharpness that lacerates itself - the final partly-off-screen murderously lustful orgy having the power of Greek and of Senecan tragedy, as rival huntresses stalk the Goddess-like perfection of the new girl with knives, and their own nails and teeth, to appropriate her power in a kind of cannibalistic magic, doing plastic surgery by using one dismembered body to donate the Goddess's flesh in a primitive communion, savagely expropriating Jessy's Beauty. The horror and beauty go hand-in-hand, just as the make-up artist who befriends the perfect new model consoles herself, after her lesbian advances are rebuffed, with one of the female corpses in the morgue where she also works making the dead presentable for their last journey. Just as big cats, both savagely prowling a seedy motel, as well as stuffed and mounted as decor, can be dangerous life and pathetic, parodic trophy.Refn is very conscious how the coldly observing lens of a camera dissects the image, consumes it, spits it out again. The abstract image of a newly-rejected model in the crazed washroom glass of her violent symbolic self-harm is a cruelly angular Picasso rearrangement of the features - and a stray shard painfully penetrates the young innocent who has come to sympathise. It eventually settles in her heart, making her worship herself and look down on other mortal beauties. The shattered older model pounces upon the bloodied hand and, vampire-like, imbibes from the living icon of perfection and success. This is the first intimation that this 'Diamond in a sea of broken glass,' as the Svengali-like fashion-house impresario calls her, will fall, and break.As she finally poises aloft, at the extreme end of the slender diving board, high above the empty deep end of this impresario's private pool, it is like the deus ex machina of Greek tragedy, as she seems to defy mortal constraints. A perverse, Euripidean conclusion is inevitable.Though I have not researched his family background, it appears that the former husband of Refn's mother (or another close relative of his?) may well be the same Andréas Winding who was responsible for many of the innovative and practical lighting techniques created for Clouzot's ill-fated 'L'Enfer.' Thus Refn may have had privileged, private access to the surviving test-footage of these techniques. In some shots of 'The Neon Demon,' Elle Fanning is even made to look uncannily reminiscent of Romy Schneider!"
" Too much Nicholas Winding Refn
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,4,"You will see NWF on your screen, more than once; writer and director, and commentator at least on the DVD/Bluray release. Too much for me in this fairy tale of a 16 year old girl Jesse (Elle Fanning) whose beauty incurs the wrath of her rivals, who would literally kill to be her. Unfortunately I did find any of the girls particularly attractive, and thought the revelations these same girls made to achieve success, trite. But no doubt there are those who feel beauty is all. For every one person like that hopefully there is at least one Dean (the young man who sees Jesse's inner beauty).I felt the character HANK, the motel manager (KEANU REEVES) was a throw away piece, and thought Christina HENDRICKS of MAD MEN wasted in a cameo.The bluray has a commentary with director and star; I don't think my take on this film will change for hearing it, and I don't want to spend another two hours trying to swallow this. I would do better to go and find my box set of PUSHER.Thanks for reading! Occasionally nice to look at, and interesting to hear CLIFF MARTINEZ, who has been scoring film for years."
" Only for the most pretentious
",2017-07-28 00:00:00,1,I like a good art film but this is barely either. A collection of loose scenes and and random sounds with a paper thin plot make for a long two hours. It tries so hard to copy classic abstract films but fails miserably. I can't imagine recommending this to anyone I know whose friendship I value. I don't mind gore or shocking imagery but its used so cheaply here with little meaning behind it that its almost insulting.
" I obviously didn't get it
",2017-07-25 00:00:00,4,"Sometimes when I watch a film and totally dislike it, I feel really bad. 'The Neon Demon' is one such example. I've checked out other people's reviews and there are those out there who clearly loved it. And I can see why. It's visually amazingly and disturbingly creepy. And yet I still found it a chore to sit through. In short I found it dull.It's about a young girl getting into the seedy underbelly of the modelling industry and encountering the sleazy men who dominate it and the catty women who already exist in it. I know a deliberately slow pace can be used to great effect in order to create tension, mood and atmosphere. However, as I said above, I just wanted something to come along and 'properly' move the story along.So, I sat through it and berated myself for not liking it more. It's very tempting to have a go at modern cinema audiences for only wanting 'simple' films with plots that involve car chases, punch-ups and a damsel in distress. I like to think my taste does incorporate a little more than the next Michael Bay disaster film. However, there are times when a more 'linier' story is needed. I felt that this is one of those times. And, it's a shame. I'll say again how much I enjoyed watching the shots. They truly are well crafted to perfection and intensely creepy. It's just not much happens quickly enough.There are nice moments of satire in the dialogue between the models, but it wasn't enough for me. Basically, if you're thinking of watching this, you need to be aware that it's very 'feel' over story. It's like an 'art movie' where it leaves you to fill in a lot of the action yourself and interpret characters' actions as you will. It does look great though and should be shown to anyone looking to get into film and create artistically-awesome shots which create mood and atmosphere."
" Interesting but could've been a lot better
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,7,"To enjoy this movie, you first shouldn't take it too seriously. The aesthetics were to die for, everything was gorgeous. A little too many mirror shots, but I guess it was appropriate. Nothing really happens, nothing profound anyway. But that's kind of the point, in my opinion. The fashion world is all fake and flashy and beautiful but it has absolutely no substance. I don't think this should be under horror. More maybe under surrealism? Elle Fanning did a great job. Her character was supposed to be this innocent scared girl but there was something floating just under the surface. I feel like it could've been played on more. Honestly it was the second part I was unsatisfied with. The necrophilia scene was just so? Unnecessary? And disturbing? But I guess it was set up for the scene where they eat Elle's character. They just eat her. And it was so anti-climatic? Like, that was it? They just ate her? Just like that? And I don't know, I feel like the movie had a strong foundation to go into a different direction and it would've been a lot better. It had potential. But the whole cannibalism thing just made it comical. It wasn't scary or shocking. I just wanted to laugh at how ridiculous it was. Also there was a scene somewhere in the beginning of the middle, where Elle's character closes her first show and she has that weird abstract scene with the triangles. What the heck was that, honestly? Was it supposed to be artsy? Some kind of metaphor or symbolism? Initiation into the fashion world? I don't know. But it made no sense. It was pretty, though. The film could definitely do without it. Overall, it was interesting, but it could've been a lot better."
" The Neon Demon
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,10,"The movie is about the vampirical consumption of youth that the fashion industry has. It's a twisted movie, with intentionally empty scenes and characters. The lead, Elle Fanning is great. Her character undergoes a transition in the middle of the movie that makes it almost like there are two characters. She is the ideal of beauty; an ideal that the movie proves does not exist. The only real characters in the movie are Gigi and Sarah. This movie is an art project. It is almost entirely metaphorical. The cinematography is great, but the standout is the way the movie is colored. It's awesome just to look at, with stark contrasts, Red vs. Blue. Visuals alone make it worth watching: they are the center of this movie, not the plot. This movie and La La Land are my two favorites for this year. Interestingly, they are both about LA, and breaking into the industry, and achieving unachievable greatness. But if La La Land shows the good in LA, then Neon Demon shows they bad. It's like the two sides of a coin- the movies are polar opposites, yet center around several of the same things. Rated R for a reason, 17+"
" Different from all the movies where there's gore for gore sake
",2017-07-04 00:00:00,8,"Not a full review, but my take on the movie. We have seen cannibalism, blood and a lot of spooky things on screen and a lot of gore that's only there in order to appear dark/blunt or simply for fetishful visual experiments. What's different about this movie is all of it has a twisted, yes, but a reason in 'The Neon Demon'. The models eating the younger competitor and bathing in her blood comes out of their obsession of beauty and their attempt to let the essence of the 'X factor' in her beauty sink into themselves. That makes it more real- like and believable. Exactly why it's spooky effect lasts longer."
" Disappointment
",2017-07-04 00:00:00,6,"I rarely write review about a movie, but I'm making an exception. Not because it's the best, but because it's the worst movie I have ever watched. I love Drive. I love those silent moments and slow motions. Because they meant something. They were elegant, meaningful and beautiful. They brought artistic sensations that not every movie can do. And when I watched this work of Nicolas Winding Refn, I felt very very angry. It's very amateur. The dialogues were bad. The actors were bad. Elle Fanning in this movie is a disaster. Frankly, she's not for this kind of movie. She's for PG-13 - family friendly. When I saw her and the cast, I paused the movie to look at the director's name again. I couldn't believe that Refn didn't do more to have a better cast, at least as good as the Drive's cast. The script has problems - big problems. However, good filming angles and nice colors contrast saved the day. They gave me more patience to pull through this, with hopes that the movie could get better. But nope, all I still remember now is nothing but nice neon colors. To my opinion, this movie it's not worth watching at all."
" A film that does for modelling what 'Black Swan' did for ballet
",2017-07-02 00:00:00,8,"Sixteen year old Jesse has made her way to Los Angeles where she aspires to become a model. Here she meet photographer Dean and makeup artist Ruby, who befriends her and introduces her to models Gigi and Sarah. Jesse is quickly snapped up by a modelling agency what thinks she could be the next 'Thing'. Inevitably other models are jealous of her natural looks and the rapid success. Things quickly turn strange; she returns to her motel room and discovers that there is a mountain lion inside! She gains confidence as she gets more work and clearly believes the adage of a designer that 'beauty isn't the most important thing about a person that matters it is the only thing'. As the end approaches it becomes apparent that not everybody she trusts is good for her and that those jealous of her really do want a piece of her!Having watched writer/director Nicolas Winding Refn's earlier film 'Drive' I was rather expecting something disturbing. This film didn't disturb me as much as 'Drive' but it shocked me more there were a few things that I really wasn't expecting such as Ruby getting intimate with a corpse after being spurned by Jesse and Jesse's ultimate fate. The cast does a fine job; Elle Fanning manages to make Jesse simultaneously vulnerable and confident. Jena Malone is equally impressive as Ruby; a character who initially appears to be the most normal character but proves to be anything but. Other cast members, including Keanu Reeves acting against type as the creepy motel manager, also impress. The story is intriguing as it gradually changes from a believable look at a young aspiring models first steps in the industry into a disturbing horror. This is hinted at early on in Jesse's first photoshoot. The story is very stylishly filmed, almost echoing the unreality of a photoshoot, something I found really effective. Over all I'd say this certainly won't be for everybody but if you enjoyed films like 'Black Swan' I suspect you will enjoy this."
" A stunning work of art
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,10,"The Neon Demon is an excellent, thought provoking journey into the state of the human condition. NWR takes the beauty industry and creates one of the most disturbing and unsettling films I have seen in a very long time.Some films are not intended to be ""watched"" in the traditional sense. They are intended to be ""experienced"". The Neon Demon is one of these films, actually, less a film, more a work of art. The world created here is so absorbing I was mesmerised for the entire film.Even though there is terrible and bloody violence in TND, that is not what unsettles here. It is the atmosphere, the constant feeling of dread and being preyed upon by ruthless predators, who seem to be around every corner, at the end of every dark alley...TND is essentially a tale of innocence and vulnerability, and how that innocence can very quickly be lost (or consumed) in the world we live in today. TND explores almost every human emotion and feeling in a very intense way, fear, love, lust, anger, frustration, rejection, obsession, they are all here, and all laid bare in the starkest of ways with no apologies to the viewer.We see the very soul of these tormented individuals, it provokes thought, introspection and if you are lucky, it changes your outlook on things. It can give an insight into some of the emotions we feel ourselves, in our every day lives, but would never act on them the way the characters in this film do.It is interesting to see the very extremes of these emotions played out on screen, some in a rather abstract way, others more directly, some with shocking results, others with a more subtle undertone.This film really is that powerful, and I am so glad that films like this continue to get the green-light.Beautifully shot (the cinematography, use of colour, and shot-framing are masterful) wonderfully scored, and perfectly cast. TND is by no means an easy film to watch, but if you bring a strong stomach, and a non-judgemental attitude, you may be enriched by it.Challenging, raw, and with something to say, a perfect example of the ""art"" of film."
" Visually stunning, but without substance (That's exactly the point.)
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,10,"A previous reviewer wrote ""Visually stunning, but without substance"". That's exactly the point.Beautiful, cruel, morally bankrupt, upsetting, magnetic, spellbinding, majestic, worrying and sickening. The film is what it aims to portray; an aspect of the 'fashion industries' brutal treatment of themselves and the humans they draw in."
" Reviews are as vapid as models being judged
",2017-06-16 00:00:00,8,"Personally, I think this movie had everything it wanted/needed to portray. Nothing was missing here. You're watching a movie about models who have this stigma of ""perfection."" You know what you're about to watch. Add these impeccable visuals and sounds, then you have a hell of a movie. The actresses here are all so equally beautiful yet are subject to an ugly competition. And there is your horror story..."
" Interesting ... but does take itself too seriously.
",2017-06-16 00:00:00,6,"""The Neon Demon"" is a trancey-paced story of a young up-and-coming model who encounters a metaphorical (and literal) hell in Los Angeles. The film is an inscrutable fusion of catty melodrama and abstract occult symbolism that includes: fluorescent triangles, levitating contortionists, transformative menstruation, and icky pagan bathing rituals (all for the sake of BEAUTY). ""The Neon Demon"" is all glossy, pleasureful surfaces but HOLLOW. Sorta like smooth background music that doesn't emotionally engage. Ironically, the film's director has said that he made his opus for teens. Despite its clichés and camp, the film's overall atmosphere is too artsy-anemic to provide any fun for your typical multiplex audience. Still, ""The Neon Demon"" is a ""nice"" weird flick.My rating: 6.5 out of 10."
" Empty as a shell
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,1,"Its no secret that Refn makes extremely violent movies (like a broad numbers of other directors) - But in his first one, Pusher (which was outstanding), made over two decades ago, you could certainly defend that violent approach due to the great story being told.However in The Neon Demon Refn seems to loose his ground dwelling into explicit violence and leaving out any reasonable reason why (I am sure he will disagree). The movie is simply without any substance and the story lacks a reasonable meaning - it comes out empty as a shell in my humble view.Once before Refn tried to copy masters like David Lynch half psychotic/half sane universe (Twin Peaks, Lost Highway) and Stanley Kubrick (A clockwork orange, 2001:A space odyssey, Eyes wide shut) when he made Fear X and Only God Forgives, but in my opinion Refn simply does not have the talent for this type of genre which The Neon Demon so obviously demonstrates.It is not that Refn cant make movies. He has made af number of strong movies like Pusher, Bronson and the international Box office succes Drive. But with The Neon Demon it just seems like Refn is more fascinated with violence and trying to be someone he is so clearly not."
" Neon and nothing else
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,6,"This is a strange movie; something that shouldn't surprise us as here we are talking about director Nicolas Winding Refn, whose previous works ""Drive"" and ""Only God Forgives"" did not leave anyone indifferent; either because it was brilliant (like in the first example) or because it was not (like in the second example).As always in his films, what gets the audience attention is how the movie's aesthetically appeal. Best things of the movie is how it looks like and its music, always good, that we cannot complain about. And in this movie, that is it. Nothing more, nothing less. Except for Elle Fanning's performance, which we know she always is good at.The story is something we have watched more than once and more than twice: the dream of a young female to go to the city where dreams come true: LA/Hollywood, depending on what dreams does she want to have. That is nothing new but what is new is the way the story is told, with some creepy scenes and a creeper outcome (won't say anything more). But still it will be probably a movie you will forget about. We will have to wait for the next ""Drive"" movie, if it comes."
" Visually Perfect, Interesting Story
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,9,"The movie ""Drive"" is my favourite movie of all time. So I was very excited to see this movie. I believe Nicholas is a very good director, although sometimes he can get too full of himself.This movie is perfect production wise. The cinematography was beautiful, and the score from Cliff Martinez is beyond amazing. The colours of this movie are beautiful and you cannot take your eyes off the screen for that very reason.This movie uses a lot of visual storytelling. I love the way in which you can understand things by just looking at what's happening instead of having someone telling it to you. It is perfect in that way.This story was written by Nicholas, and it does have some very interesting things to say about our perceptions of beauty. It is full of visual metaphors as you might expect, and it leaves you puzzled. I really urge you not to have a defined opinion about this movie as soon as you finish it, give it time to sink in and analyze it.Some people might find this movie extremely disturbing. There are some things in this movie that might shock some people. I have and don't have a problem with the shock factor in the film. On one hand, I really liked when Nicholas uses some strong imagery to get an idea into your head, on the other hand, there are some things that in my opinion just happen to shock the audience.Another nitpick I have with the film is that the main character is supposed to be the prettiest woman in the movie, but there were some other characters that I though looked way prettier, anyway, that's my opinion and I won't take the movie points away for that.In conclusion, see it. But give it your full attention and try not to get ""offended"" by the imagery, it is part of the film."
" Symbolic social commentary
",2017-05-27 00:00:00,8,"Maybe I'm reading into this too much, but I thought this was a great horror film. It captured some of the horror that makes us uneasy, but we fail to acknowledge on a daily basis.The setting for this movie is the modeling industry, where participants schmooze with the powerful hoping to find their break. Without spoiling too much, I'll just summarize by saying the industry is shown to be competitive, cutthroat, and superficial. One fashion designer tells a model that ""true beauty is the highest currency in this world."" He even points out the hypocrisy of an amateur photographer who disagrees. Though all the girls are beautiful, the main character quickly rises to the top. Though she initially stated she had no talent, she later admits that she knows other girls wish they could one day be a second-rate version of her.The ending is by far the best part. After the models eat their ""friend,"" Gigi starts to feel queezy, ultimately throwing up an eyeball and stabbing herself to death. Without much hesitation at all, the remaining friend eats the eyeball and continues with her career."
" Glamour bitchiness horror, with brilliant Lynchian, Kubrick, Haneke and Shakespeare touches.
",2017-05-26 00:00:00,9,"WOW! Rarely do I anymore get the experience like as one famous UK TV reviewer*, who once confessed that most of what he saw was trash / disappointing, so why do it, go on? Because, he explained, just occasionally, an offering comes along, out of the blue (left field) to stun and impress so much that makes it all worthwhile. Well, this is one of them! BRILLIANT! As is the spectacular cinematography (superb Natasha Braier) and colour scheme throughout, and in which so enjoying you can spot the Lynch, Kubrick (even Haneke) touches (even, are they deliberate homages, perhaps, Mr. Refn?) That's it, for this is one that should not be plot spoilt in the least (which is how I fortunately came to it and the second half stunned.) And taking you along for the uncertain ride is also then an utterly superb soundtrack courtesy of now several times partnership to director Refn, Cliff Martinez.Of course, it's already somewhat 'spoilt' by being labelled a sort of horror sci-fi: yet, just like the best horror films of old, all the better that the monster is not shown, so with this you can further 'enjoy' spotting all the shock horror tropes, most all the better for all being mostly only inferred throughout, so to be that much more disturbing as the realisation of what is (probably) happening, unfolding, takes hold of you.Refn states that the end product is not really that important to him, rather than the process of getting the project up onto the screen: in that case, it makes this even more, er, unsettling as presumably it is a paean to the 'wholesomeness' of the (bitchy to a deadly degree) fashion glamour world: in which case an excellent beware to all those (small town girls, as Fanning is) who would be inveigled into its 'horrors'.

" Flawed, but unique and entertaining
",2017-05-18 00:00:00,7,"The Neon Demon is definitely a gorgeous film. Each shot is painterly, giving a sense of personality and energy to every frame. I can't quite name one shot that couldn't be framed and hung up at an art gallery. The soundtrack too is completely gorgeous, nailing a distinct mixture of haunting electro beats and fairytale synths. The Neon demon is definitely a welcome and fresh surprise in this barren apocalyptic landscape that is current movies, but it's not completely free of sin. The main problem with the movie is the screenplay. While it skirts along from one epic artsy- setpiece to the next(The nightclub scene, the gold paint shoot scene, the runway scene, the eyeball scene), the connecting tissue to those scenes isn't as strong. The characters are mostly vapid and since this is a movie about Los Angeles and the modeling industry I completely understand that, but it can become a bit tiresome after a while. It's obvious that Nicholas Winding Refn is trying to give the main character (Elle Fanning) a certain sense of innocence and naivety as to make her transformation (during the pivotal runway scene) all the more jarring, but once she makes that transformation, she doesn't really follow through on it. There's one scene where she gives her sort-of boyfriend the cold shoulder, but other than that she (spoiler alert!) dies before she can even do anything. I would have liked to see become as cold as the models preying on her, and perhaps kill the character of Ruby, who isn't a part of the shocking set-piece at the end of the movie. Besides those problems, there's only a couple other minor grievances I have with the film. The models were all very good, and Jena Malone was fantastic, and also extremely daring and ballsy (a particular scene in a morgue is quite disgusting and shocking). The only character I particularly disliked was the male fashion designer, who was just completely absurdly unrealistic. The fact is that most male fashion designers are gay, and even if they aren't, their not as alpha and brooding as he was. The worst scene in the film is a conversation between Elle Fanning's sort-of boyfriend and the fashion designer, where the fashion designer says ""Beauty isn't everything, it's the only thing"". The boyfriend replies with: ""I think it's what's inside that counts"". WHAT? This is a line that betrays the character first of all (in the opening shot he is shooting Elle Fanning draped over the couch, dripping fake blood from her neck), and also just comes off as completely disingenuous. The film's entire aesthetic is beauty. It's beauty for beauty's sake. The film, up to that point, is not about feminism or ideology. It's merely bathing in aesthetics. You can make a film about how ""Whats on the inside counts"" but this is certainly not that film. If I were Nicholas Winding Refn I would not have let that line fly. At least next time you'll know, hopefully.All that aside, I implore Hollywood to look at unique, interesting and well-made films like this and say ""Let's do more of those"". I don't know how many more ugly, stale Marvel films I can watch before my head explodes from boredom. I haven't seen all of Nicholas Winding Refn's films, and I'll admit that some of his earlier work isn't for me. I didn't really dig Valhalla Rising or Bronson, or the first Pusher for that matter (I know the sequels are better and I'm looking forward to seeing them), but what he's been doing recently, with Drive, Only God Forgives and now this, I'm pretty sure I'll be the first in line to see whatever he does next."

That line could just as easily be the main interpretation for Refn's latest abysmally sinister perturbation ""The Neon Demon"". Like ""Only God Forgives"", ""The Neon Demon"" follows in the footsteps of the lead protagonist Jesse (Elle Fanning) who is torturously being consumed by her dreams. This innocent, neophyte fashion model unfolds the story of a 16-year-old girl who visits Los Angeles intending to become a promiscuous super model in a world mainly ruled by a poker-faced agent Roberta Hoffman (Christina Hendricks), an emotionally unstable make-up artist Ruby (Jena Malone), stereotypical anorexic models like Gigi (Bella Heathcote), known for her ""vampiric"" relations with Johnny Depp in Tim Burton's film ""Dark Shadows"" and a seedy motel owner Hank (Keanu Reeves). The question hidden under this neon reverie of such sheer satanic rapture is not about how ""The Neon Demon"" shows its ballet of envy, necrophilia, erotic obsession and cannibalism whereas how does this worthless meretricious world represents only just a cinematic superficiality. Refn's captivation through a vortex of tedious one-shot scenes is constantly attempting to reveal a futuristic and astonishing society which in fact has nothing to state. Welcome to a fake world where scenes are a cheap imitation of ""Melancholia"", the melodic masterpiece Lars von Trier launched to cinema and ""Death Becomes Her"", an ingenious delirium Robert Zemeckis has invented. Not to mention that the scenes in which Jesse appears in a visionary night club looks vaguely like a combination of ""Tron"" and ""Under the skin"". How does pure imitation even make this film a must watch movie of the year? The answer is simple. The ""Neon Demon"" is a neon dystopian nightmare unable to trigger audience's attention as the more you get into the notion of the film the less interesting it becomes. Anyone could claim that critical offence can all too easily be taken at a piece of preening auteur cinema that sets out shock especially when on its first screening at Cannes, people were leaving screaming. On the other hand, anyone could agree to the fact that when a film features more thought provoking ideas, the audience can handle the shocking notion the film represents. Having said that, ""The Neon Demon"" struggles to present a productive script, co- written with the playwrights Mary Laws and Polly Stenham, which in fact is stuffed with gaps that ultimately transmutes its satisfying character into a preposterous one. Gaps which unfortunately reflect the issue of quality in several moments of memorable scenes. If all this sounds like an attack on culture that is obsessed with the way people look, it isn't. Refn never intended to satirize the fashion world or more specifically the modeling world so much. Instead he tried to deal with a more disfigured view of it in a way this stomach-churning world seems boring. Beyond the valleys of offensive criticism, the Danish director through his filmography (Drive, Only God Forgives, Bronson) has shown a dynamic character in terms of his own style. He puts his signature into films which looked like predators that reflect two mindsets: Either you constantly plumb your id or you just exist as a passive narrative. Both ways seem to end up debatable but at the same time productively brash. And therein lies the key. Refn may have succumbed to his most unabashed urges but in fact he overgeneralized the issue through a narcissist's eyes. Yet soon, this film can be compared to as a surface modernity both for its inner construction and its outside corruptible beauty. Before I run out of words, ""The Neon Demon"" is not just a bad movie led by a remarkable writer/director/creator of the neon world but is just a movie at the right place in the wrong time. Refn has invented a surficial movie for surficial characters who are not able to ""digest"" reality. In this case, ""The Neon Demon"" is a nightmare you must NOT watch if you think yourself as a doubter."
" A great opportunity, wasted.
",2017-05-09 00:00:00,5,"I absolutely loved most of the film. The acting was good, the plot was, though not captivating, interesting, and the casting was incredible. It was well directed, and the characters and lines seemed quite natural and well written. I very much enjoyed it and kept wondering why it got a 6.2/10 on IMDb throughout the movie. I was more than ready to give it an 8 at least. (It's worth repeating that there are spoilers from this point on) Then, Jesse (Elle Fanning) died. It was striking, and would have made for a great finale. At that point, I was awe-struck, impressed that they dared to kill off the protagonist. But the movie didn't end at that point. It kept going, and going, and going. From that point onward, everything was just... how to put it... weird. The movie got very alien, and while that is not grounds to dislike a movie, this particular one was a very ""normal"" movie for an hour and a half, and only the last twenty minutes were like that. To me, it was out of place. That last part was as if it was stitched to the movie. It may sound cruel or unjust to lower my rating from at least an 8 to a solid 5 only because of the last twenty minutes, but that last twenty minutes utterly ruined what could have been an incredible movie. A real shame, honestly."
" Beauty is a beast, but this film is neither
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,4,"""The Neon Demon"" is a co-production in the English language between the United States, France and Denmark and the latter is because the director is Nicolas Winding Refn, maybe Denmark's second most known and second most controversial behind Lars von Trier of course. The movie here runs for almost 120 minutes and stars Elle Fanning playing the central character. Familiar faces like Malone, Reeves, Hendricks and Harrington (to ""Dexter"" fans) appear in supporting roles. But this film is at no point about the performances unfortunately. You can very easily structure it into two parts. The first is the audience being introduced to the modeling business at the same time the central character is introduced. We basically experience everything related to this tough business together with Fanning's character. Unfortunately, nonetheless it is never a good or interesting depiction of events and circumstances. It is really much more on the level of a generic soap opera. We witness almost every female character being jealous of Jesse or exploiting her magnificent looks. And the men all either want her or want to turn her into a star. And so we won't forget how amazing she looks we have scenes like the first one with Harrington or the one with Nivola or the one with Hendricks which are all basically the same. They show us how tough they are by ignoring or sending out less brilliant models, but they all love our ""heroine"". As if we would not see ourselves how amazing Fanning looks in here with that pale blonde (almost princess-like) appearance. Admittedly she is not 100% more stunning than the other models/actresses, even if the film wants us to believe she is.Then the second half. And people who have seen other works by NWR maybe already expect what is about to come, namely the possibly most pretentious movie hour of the year 2016. It is a collection of shots that were intended to be stylish and admittedly some are, but others also not so much. Light and color are in the center of it all, but the action and the plot certainly aren't. It's basically like watching a catalog of photos, maybe videos, made during a session. Yes there is a major event happening towards the end and it is a bit on the brave side admittedly in terms of the script, but it just isn't enough to be honest and there is also not really any justification for the blood lust in here towards the end. Envy and hurt feelings / rejection alone won't cut the cake. So it needs to be said that the ways in which this film tries to work as a character study or as an elaboration on the modeling world are not successful at all. Not even close. The only approach where the film is somewhat successful is seeing it as a(n admittedly really absurd) fantasy story of over-the-top characters. I cannot take it seriously as a thriller or drama or horror film. Then again, maybe you can see it as a splatter horror of some kind with all the stuff that happens in the last 20 minutes. Final verdict though is that this one is totally close to one star out of five and giving it two is still fairly on the generous side. It shows that Nicolas Winding Refn is obviously far far away from his career-best. Highly not recommended and way too long for its own good too. Final note: It's quite a shame an actually really talented actress like Elle Fanning, in my opinion among the most gifted from her generation, is wasted like this here being basically nothing but a doll, despite having the screen time to really make a difference. That's a definition of bad writing."
" Disappointing
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,3,"I just watched this film on Netflix ,which i had been browsing through hoping to find a good thriller this one had been given 4 stars so i thought ahh it must be good.???? No i was wrong The film starts off promising enough and is about a young 16 year old girl who has run away from home and turns up in Los Angeles hoping to become a model,here she encounters and makes friends with a lesbian make up artist who hangs out with two other women,one an over the hill model and the other a model wannabe.The lesbian wants to bed her where the other two women are envious of her and want to be her. She also has a nice caring boyfriend who makes photo shoots of her and helps her put a portfolio together. After a very short time in the industry she becomes the special one and the new promising IT girl.She then becomes very self obsessed and vain and acts like shes immortal,she dumps the nice boyfriend as his no longer of any use to her,and the other two models who have been cast aside by the industry become even more envious which lead to disastrous consequences. This is basically the thin plot of the film. Through out the film her dwellings are in a run down motel run by a rapist possibly peadophile (Forgive me for not writing down the characters names but they were all pretty much pointless empty unrealistic characters with no real substance} As I've said the film started off okay and held your interest as to where it was all leading,but further into the film it just became stranger and stranger and towards the end had some very distasteful scenes one involving the make up artist performing a necrophilliac act(disgusting). Apart from this i couldn't understand why if she was the new top model why she was still living in a run down terrible motel,wouldn't the modeling industry have moved her into a nice penthouse suite? Also why didn't she call the police when she heard the woman in the next apartment being raped or killed as she thought. The directing was annoying as well where in many scenes there was too many long pauses every time they spoke,you felt like certain scenes should be speeded up ,but all through the film it was slow and plodding. I gave this film a 3 because i did find the acting good at least"
" A visual feast but took too long for dessert.
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,6,"Nicolas Wining Refn manages to bring all the qualities he's known for into this film, but that's not necessarily a good thing. To cut to the chase, The Neon Demon is about the struggles of both high fashion modeling and teenage runaways. Although, I doubt that's what the film is entirely about as it has a lot of deep symbolical meaning. The opening is unique and Refn makes another great opening. Now to get more analytical. A) Acting: Elle Fanning looks and sounds perfect for the part but I couldn't help but sigh every time she talked. She was so monotone and bland but pretty much all the characters are like that. Maybe its just Refn films as Drive and Only God Forgives also had some very monotone dialogue. Jenna Malone did better than most, witch a somewhat creepy aura yet a kindhearted soul at the same time. Reeves was a real show stealer as he make you forget that he is Reeves for most of the film. You start to despise him and his gruffy look really matched the film. As for the rest, well mediocre at best but a lot were models to be fair. B) Writing: At first the movie moves on pretty well with an intriguing opening and some pretty shots but ultimately it starts to spiral out of control. It maintains it's order until the scene where someone, Keanu Reeve's somewhat implied, is raping someone next to Fanning's room. Refn threw in a romance between Malone and Fanning which seem irrelevant and then all of a sudden Fanning's character goes from humble to an egotistical prick. Now I've heard that Refn shot this in chronological order and improvised the ending. Very few directors can pull off improvising, like Terrance Malick or Robert Altman, and it is quite obvious that it was indeed improvised. The film was indeed psychological but instead it spirals to a sudden gory and chaotic thriller(?). The ending was just the cherry on top. I couldn't think what was more weird, her throwing up an eye or her friend just scoffing and walking away. The Neon Demon isn't terrible it just starts to deteriorate at the end. If you're a fan of Refn or love visually stunning films, this is definitely worth a watch."
" A surprisingly hollow experience
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,4,"THE NEON DEMON sees Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn coming a cropper with a spare, stylish, thinly-plotted horror movie set in the world of modelling in Los Angeles. It's as slow-paced and stylish as his previous movies DRIVE and ONLY GOD FORGIVES, featuring a funky soundtrack, lots of powerful colour in the visuals, and scenes that go on a little while too long.It's also over-obvious and predictable, being nothing more than a twist on an old-fashioned vampire-style story that goes back hundreds of years. For the first time in a Refn film, I found myself counting the minutes that passed, aware of a growing sense of boredom rather than unease. The film takes ages and ages just to get anywhere, and it only shocks and provokes right at the climax. Up until that point, we get stuck with Elle Fanning's bland lead, some typically bitchy supporting characters, and a whole lot of emptiness. I found it rather vapid, although tastes may vary. Refn tries too hard to make something unique and arty and instead makes something predictable and empty; for a true slice of weirdness you need to go to Europe and check out something in the style of DER FAN or SUSPIRIA instead."
" Naive?
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,8,"Is beauty good or bad, or something beyond the both of them? The movie does seem to argue that beauty is something that exist, but also that it does not have to be something positive. If ""beauty is everything"", and there is nothing else - which is stated in the film - then everything we see in it must be seen as some sort of comment on beauty. My main gripe with this movie is just that: whatever the movie says about beauty, it does not feel all that profound or fresh. The symbolism used is at times very on the nose and obvious. Almost naive, as if someone who has never had anything to do with the LA beauty scene decides to make a critical story set in it. (That last sentence was not really meant as negative assumption towards Refn, because I do like the movie he has made.) It is a compelling movie to watch, because it is both beautiful and disgusting. Mostly clean, but at times utterly vulgar. I also enjoyed the movie's several turns into the ""odd"". It all made me really enjoy the movie, but it was also despite itself, as the story itself and the thematic exploration seemed to me to be almost banal. But somehow it works."
" The visuals are pretty.
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,2,"Just saw this on a German 4K blu-ray import w/o HDR. (The US blu-ray is only standard HD.) It looks wonderful. If you need a beautiful silent picture running in the background...this is for you.As for the actual film...it's slow. Very slow. The acting is incredibly stilted. The plot's silly. It's not scary or frightening. There is no build up of tension. Neither cannibalism nor necrophilia even make this one dimensional story interesting. It is difficult to say much about a movie that knows nothing of character development (there isn't any), plot (minimal) or emotional impact (none)...but it looks great on my 4K TV."
" Avoid at all costs
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,1,"Boring, pretentious art-house garbage.Don't waste your time like I did if you liked his films like Drive or Bronson - this pales in comparison.I really want my two hours back.Do I really need more text to submit this review. Hmm"
" How colorful, but for what?
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,3,"I'm watching this movie and I'm wondering what you want to tell me. I just understand that you're criticizing the fake fashion world. But he does it as bland as what he criticizes.It is spectacular in terms of photography. How colorful. It is very beautiful, what happens is that I do not know what it is for.I guess it's about being psychological, but these things have to be done very well or you get ridiculous and this time you fell into ridicule.It is especially misdirected, it has ugly and poorly composed planes. It bores to the satiety.It really is that it does not give more for the film"
" Some of my thoughts on The Neon Demon.
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,3,"Hey there. I watched this film last weekend and here are some of my thoughts on The Neon Demon:Just watched The Neon Demon, which is the definition of style without substance. I remember when it opened. There was a feeling of much discussion about it. By no means I ever thought this would be a blockbuster, therefore didn't think it would do as bad as it did. Many instances I feel that people are missing out whenever a film does badly at the box office, but in this case it was understandable.It is effective on mood and atmosphere but only to a degree; I found it to be mostly boring. It's fine when a film is presented in a meditative way, but it loses appeal fast if the storyline is quite vapid. By no means I would consider it a horror film; it's a drama that has some horrific elements in it.For Jesse (Elle Fanning) who wants a successful modeling career comes across especially in the beginning after already doing photo shoots as insecure. There isn't much of an issue in the acting department. The music/score is quite atmospheric. There seems to be very little dialogue and a lot of lingering scenes, and I am okay with that but none of the characters are worth giving a damn for. I could care less about modeling and its cutthroat industry.The only one worthwhile is Keanu Reeves. He shows up as a motel manager. Karl Glusman is OK, but there isn't really any depth. So as I mentioned in the beginning about it performing terribly at the box office and for good reason, it seemed highly praised. Perhaps it may have hit a core among its audience as a result of the timing. It was up against Independence Day: Resurgence and The Shallows at the height of the summer blockbusters so in comparison yeah it is different and weird, but not much underneath. Especially seeing it almost a year later, it doesn't hold any weight.*spoiler alert*There seemed to some excitement over the final twenty minutes. Jesse (Elle Fanning) stands on the edge of a diving board above an empty swimming pool almost sounding threatening in her dialogue, therefore giving a slightly tense atmosphere. She then is chased by a couple of the women and afterwards is surrounded by the empty pool and is thrown in. Surprisingly she dies; lying there as the blood slowly pours out of her. Later on, one of the women confesses to eating her. Feeling physically pained as a result so she begins stabbing herself. Weird.So that's it! Apparently that was the big crazy ending people were talking about."
" worst movie ever
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,1,the writer and director should be put behind bars. I am not sure how could anyone have voted positively for such a film. there have been are other bad films that inexplicably received good reviews so i believe the film industry wants to convince people into watching them and thefore a lot of these reviews/votes must be fake.
" Oh my god
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,3,The worst 2 hours spend opposite my TV to watch a movie. Made no sense whatsoever. It had Only few pretty girl models. Not a horror movie. Not even thriller. The shot with the wild cat in the motel did not give any meaning. Keanu Reeves petty to play in the movie. Had a few disgusting shots and a lesbian necro scene. Very slow. No real plot. No meaning. Not scary.
" Sucked
",2017-03-08 00:00:00,1,"This movie was so horrible, I hate to spend anymore time having to write a review, but i feel people should be warned. Your time is to precious to waste a minute of it on such a bad movie. It was so slow and boring. I'm not sure why it's in the horror and thriller genre. In fact, I'm not sure what category this movie belongs. It's not funny, has no drama or action, there's no mystery, or anything else that would place it in another genre. Is there a boring or weird genre? That's where it belongs. You would be better off watching paint dry."
" Unconventional psychological thriller
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,7,"If you love the movie in which the characters are disclosed in the course of the film, the expected unexpected plot twists and other classic cinematic techniques.. This film is not for you. Refn has created a film in which are only relevant image and music. The plot is not something minor. In this film, there is no plot. Despite the fact that we can easily find the beginning, culmination and finale, it does not matter. We look perfectly made frames. In these ideal frames, violence, beauty and psychological tension are combined. And this combination creates a hypnotic effect that catch our view on what's happening on the screen. And therein lies the beauty of this film."
" To die for
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,7,"Hmmm, this isn't what I thought it would be at all. I was expecting an inside look at the modelling world with maybe a bit more edge than ""America's Next Top Model"".What we get though is something that is hard to describe. It is indeed a look at the world of modelling but it paints it as beyond superficial and very creepy.Jesse (Elle Fanning), a young girl, very young, just turned 16, arrives in LA looking to become a model. She is incredibly shy, but very beautiful. Nearly everyone she meets is either jealous of her beauty or lusts after her – or sometimes both.She meets one nice young guy, Dean (Karl Glusman) who tries to look after her, but the peer pressure is stifling and she is absorbed into the modelling scene as the fresh new look.She encounters more than cattiness from the other models, and at various stages I wasn't sure if this was actually a vampire movie without the fangs. There is even a bit of the old necrophilia to really creep the whole thing out.It is a horror film of course and taken on that level it is stylish and disturbingly effective.The film is dark metaphorically and literally; other than the brightly lit photography sessions and the strobe effects for the catwalk scenes, the stars inhabit a dimly lit world. The darkness and stillness of the whole piece tends to kill any erotic energy in the film although it is full of sexual attraction in all its forms.I don't view things like the halo of blood from a traumatic head injury as a study in beauty, but this film finds art in unexpected places. David Cronenberg's ""Crash"" and Darren Aronofsky's ""Black Swan"" come to mind, but ""The Neon Demon"" is hard to pin down.I have always felt that the best horror movies don't have a supernatural element, which means we don't have the safety net of knowing it couldn't really happen. As long as you accept that just about anything goes in a genuinely edgy horror movie, then ""The Neon Demon"" definitely delivers.If you are expecting an inside look at the modelling industry in the same way that ""The Devil Wears Prada"" took an inside look at the fashion magazine industry, ""The Neon Demon"" isn't that movie."
" Double-edged
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,9,"When a young girl enters an unknown world on her own without any guidance from her family or asking anyone for support in the sense of being alone and facing the harsh reality of glamour, show business with bravery and getting to know another side of mankind in a short stage at the very beginnings of a career that is about to start."
" Bored for an hour and a half, traumatized in the last 30
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,6,"I'd been kind of ignoring this thing for ever. I was told it was a horror film about models and I'll be honest I could not get in the mood for it. I managed to sit down for a quiet unobstructed evening to try and get through whatever this was.I can be open to slowburn films as long as something about it pulls me. That I can feel the progress of the film like pages turning. This felt like it went no where for an hour and a half. Vapid teen goes to CA to be a model. It's just random scenes of her interacting with people and dream sequences. I think my problem is she, the main character, never says anything. I'm not asking for profound epiphanies or inner monologues. 90% of her dialog is her saying ""Not really..no?"" and it's impossible to care. I found the surrounding characters far more compelling, that was still little to none.I think the writer was going for Bret Easton Ellis in the theme and Kubrick in the cinematography. The Kubrick you get. I'll admit the highlights of the film are the dream sequences. BEE is respected for writing captivating stories about empty people and the dialog is witty. There's none of that here. Everyone in the film speaks each line in 5 syllables or less and it drove me crazy.Then the last 30 minutes, it turns into a horror show that would make Edgar Allen Poe quit drinking. I haven't seen anything that disturbing since Martyrs which I absolutely despise.So yeah if you really want a film slower and less interesting than ""Solaris"" with a big disgusting last act payoff more power to you. Was not worth it to me."
" The neon demon is a truthful, albeit exaggerated representation of how normal people normally react under not normal circumstances.
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,10,"Fame and fortune are very nice things to have, indeed...Now what we have here is a tale of a country girl coming to a big city looking for both of the things mentioned above, I.e., fame and fortune.But, the thing about this movie that is different is that the girl finds fame and fortune... ""but can she keep it?"", is the main question here.Our protagonist is thrown into the cut-throat world of the beauty business where not much holds barred. In this surreal world where what we'd consider to be aberrant behavior is the norm a lot can go wrong for our protagonist, lest she be vigilant and see the danger.Now just to make myself perfectly clear, this movie is not about crazy people it's about people becoming crazy in order to survive in the do-or-die world of high fashion. If you want to see something like that then this motion picture is for you."
" Poetic, stunning, violent, cult.
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,9,"First off, this is not a feel good movie. This is a WTF kind of film. If you loved Drive but cringed when Cranston got his arm cut, prepare for another visceral endeavor. Neon Demon starts off cautionary, transcends surreal (several times), and then goes full on horror/thriller. The conclusion is absolutely WTF.From the minute the shutters flash in the beginning with Jesse (Fanning) posing for an amateur shoot, we're aware that she's in way over her head. Naïve, underage, beautiful, vulnerable, she's a girl chasing a dream about to be swallowed by a world all too used to eating through potential starlets; Hollywood, CA. She befriends Ruby (Malone), a Sapphic make-up prof who moonlights as a morgue assistant at night. Ruby is intermingled to a posse of veteran models who already know the ropes of the Hollywood machine and take no time sticking Fanning in her place to avoid a potential talent uprising. Drama ensues.Being the attractive magnet that she is, Jesse must play smart in a world full of cutthroat talent scouts, agency reps, love interests, rapist motel clerks, and jealous peers. But will she use intuition to avoid the malaise of the glamorous, or be sucked into it's vapid vortex? You'll need watch Neon Demon to find out for yourself, but the conclusion (while fairly obvious) is startling.Pacing is on track, scary, then scarier, then startling, and then ultimately ""how the hell did they film this?"" moments. Acting is also on point, in particular Malone and Hendricks are my absolute favorites. Hendricks unfortunately doesn't have a lot of screen time in this, pretty much limited to one scene, but this is about the most believable role I've seen her in. Malone, dear God. This is THE girl we need to watch out for. If you thought she stole the show in Catching Fire, see her in this. Keanu plays a character that is simply dripping with slime. And while the models are absolutely plastic, the gravitas in their performance is nothing short of a forewarning about what modeling in the fashion world is really like. Harrington and Glusman are equally as empty, portraying a world in which superficiality is the ONLY thing (incredible casting for Harrington, you're almost afraid of him the first time you watch the movie). Lastly, Fanning is a delight. Clean, sweet, pretty, fragile, and then at one point develops into The Demon, she changes at the same pace the movie unfolds. This is a surreal flick (it is a Refn film), so expect flash montages, saturated vibrant colors, glitter, body landscapes, pools of blood, moonlight, pure white, the most perfect blacks, liquids, slow-mo, nipples, vulvae, absolute violence, beautiful decay, the gorgeous. The movie's soundtrack could have its own introduction, bass thumping, soft undertones, electronica, and just about anything you can think of on the catwalk present. This IS a cult title in the same vein as Scanner Darkly, Spring Breakers, Traffic, Blow, Boogie Nights, and any other film that tells you what the real price is for living in the fast lane.You've been warned."
" This film aspires to be dismal
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,1,In my entire life have I ever seen such utter rubbish. The film was supposed to be a horror film but have seen more scarier scenes in Scooby do. I have just spent 1hr 56mins of my life watching this amateurish drivel. 1hr and 56 minutes of my life I will never get back. This film had the styling of a 12 yr old trying to emulate the classic film Bladerunner with the synth moody music and failed on a catastrophic level. For anyone to give this film a rating of anything more than a 1 seriously needs to get out more. If you ever think about watching this film with a view to being entertained can I suggest you not bother and try to find a film that is 100x better. Can I suggest a 3hr documentary film on magnolia paint. I am so surprised that excellent actors like Reeves and Fanning actually put their names to this utter tosh. Avoid this film at all cost. Unless you have guests in your home who have outstayed their welcome then in that case bang this film on. They'll be gone in 10 minutes.
" It's unique, weird, totally messed up, but it's fantastic.
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,10,"The great director Nicolas Winding Refn, from movies like ""Bronson"" ""Drive"" and ""Only God Forgives"" returned in 2016 to tell us the story of ""The Neon Demon"" a completely new story in its cinematographic directional territories, a movie which will be spoken about a lot and it will become a cult film in the near future.Nicolás Winding Refn is very famous for his experimental cinema, a unique cinema where he shows us harshness and violence and at the same time he gives us a great deep feeling in his plots combined with the touch of surrealism ""Art House"".It was in 2011 when he gave us his biggest hit ""Drive"" A thriller with retro ambiance of the 80′s cinema set in modern times, it was this film which put him on the top, later in 2013 gave us one of his most sublime works and one of the deepest of his career and one of the most hated by the critic it's ""Only God Forgives"" which I consider one of his deepest and most visceral films with an amazing photograph that takes you into it's surreal world, the movie was booed by the Critics of Cannes and is considered the worst of his career while others claim that it is one of the most deep and sublime works of this directorAnd now in 2016 he came back to tell the story of ""The Neon Demon"" a dark fairy tale about the world of beauty and tells the story of Jesse a 16 year old girl who aspires to be a model and moves to Los Angeles to achieve this goal, it's here when she meets the twisted and dangerous world of fashion, where she will attract everyone's eyes, but also will awaken the envy of those who'll do everything to steal her beauty and youth.I can say with great confidence that this is one of his most grotesque and disturbing films and the most beautiful talking visually, the film itself is sublime and catching, full of anagrams and subtle references, is a film that is told through surreal images, Images that tell the story little by little, is not a film that relies heavily on dialogue but visual metaphors.From the hand of the great cinematographer Natasha Brier, she gives us fantastic and amazing cinematography, the best photography of this year in cinema, the technical part is a wealth in this film, the use of lights and shots steal the breath and immerse you In the electric lights of the city of Los AngelesThe script written by Nicolás Winding Refn and Mary Laws and it tells us this twisted story, a script that it would say it's one of his bests,, a script that catches the world of beauty in Los Angeles as much as it enters you in the nightmare of madness that can be.The direction by Nicolás Winding Refn is an achievement, an incredible direction, each scene is a delight to watch, and the performances do not fail, especially Elle Fanning and Jena Malone, these two stole the film.And no, we can not forget the great music by Cliff Martinez, a music so hypnotizing and psychedelic with synthesizers full of retro sounds to the most romantic sound to the most nightmarish and disturbing as possible.The best way to describe this film is to say that the masterpiece Mulholland Drive of David Lynch had a son with the terrifying Suspira of Dario ArgentoIt is a Drama Thriller with experimental Horror that is worth seeing in the movie theater, a disturbing critic and view to the world of fashion, treating the theme of beauty in its most satirical and twisted way possible.A surreal and frightening experience of the great Nicholas Winding Refn.""Beauty is not everything. Its the only thing ""It's unique, weird, totally messed up, but it's fantastic."
" Beauty and the Beast/Demon
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,9,"Is innocence the pure beauty? And what would happen to that Beauty once the innocence was gone? And how do you measure Beauty or innocence for that matter, anyway? Who is to say, which of many many models who are trying their luck, is the ""best""? Who actually ""deserves"" to be a top star? These are just a couple of questions that are not spoken out in the movie. But they linger in the air.They linger there with dread, as is the mood of the movie. And while many rush to belittle the movie by just looking at the obvious (style), they might be missing the points Refn is making. But then again, his movies are never easy to digest are they? And one that has been described as horror, because of certain scenes is not different. The movie may have despicable characters, but it also has a foundation and something to say. So while I do not agree by many things that are being done here, I was mesmerized. And yes there is a different dimension within this ..."
" Tripe
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,5,"So they ate elle fanning in the end. Yes, they ate her. But apparently the human eyeball is indigestible lol. What utter drivel this film turned out to be. A 1 hour and 50minutes watch for the most pathetic ending you ever did see. Oh and elle fanning as the most naturally beautiful model in California. My god i'm still laughing at that one. And no nudity on screen from fanning. So it was doubly pointless booking her for this gig."
" SO BAD. Style over substance... yet again from Nicolas Winding Refn
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,1,"PLEASE, Nicolas Winding Refn needs to take Screen writing CLASSES. It seems he only took cinematography courses before he became a director. We get it he understands pretty visuals. Story is absolutely HORRIBLE. The ending is something out of a cheap horror film, I don't know if we're supposed to be shocked or... laughing. He is probably trying to please the weird ""art house"" crowd, but he is no David Lynch - this is nowhere near the brilliance or level of Mulholland Dr. And I thought his other movie ""Only God Forgives"" was bad... Nicolas Winding Refn seems to be consistent in all his films with the same formula: he runs out of ideas and the ending always deals with some cop-out, sadistic, grotesque bloodbath. His movie ""Drive"" probably had the most potential, but he just doesn't know where he's going with this films. Why even have Keanu Reeves?!? Even in an interview, Keanu asked the director what was the deal with all the random triangle and everything in the film and the director couldn't even answer it! It's just random - there is no meaning. I'm pretty sure deep down inside, Keanu is also thinking what the hell the point of the movie was."
" Show, don't tell
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,7,"A visual symphony showcasing the timeless imagery of beauty, composed by one of the most interesting contemporary directors. Ambition makes up for what the story is lacking, and the film manages to explore interesting fundamental questions by leaving space for a silence that allows rare space for ongoing contemplations."
" 2 hours of Torture
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,1,"I'm not sure how this has an average rating of 6 stars. There's basically no dialogue, no rhyme or reason to any of the characters or plot, terrible acting, no emotions, no action, no anything.The main character is the least attractive character in the movie, which makes the story even less believable.There are several scenes in the movie which were there strictly for awe value, and did not contribute anything to the actual plot.The whole thing is just boring and awkward, and I want these 2 hours of my life back."
" Fincheresque? Possible spoiler last paragraph.
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,8,"If I watched this Film without knowing who the Director was, I may have thought it was David Finch simply because of the style of shooting and the artistic background. Someone mentioned 'Kubrick' like but I didn't see that until I read that comment and I guess it could also be 'Kubrick'. As for the Film itself, I thought at first I was in for one of those Films where the Music would be spoiling the story but I soon was engrossed in the Film for the reasons above and time flew quite fast even though the scenes were shot very slow but I did like this way of shooting and the scenery. I'm not going to say much what went on and I'm sure it's been said already but you get that from the Film review itself what's happening with the girls!The ending was a little weird and I didn't really understand the 'eye' unless it was to do with the girl seeing too much... too much for her to understand and the other girl devouring it so others can't see either."
" Horror it is not!
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,4,"Not entirely surprised by the direction of the film, as I have watched and not appreciated others he has been involved in, but it is a pretty slow and painful offering. Was I scared? About as much as by ""Black Swan"" which was also over-rated in my opinion. If you appreciate the arty but ultimately dreary plot and slow progression then you probably appreciated ""Drive"" too. I didn't and although I didn't give up on it part way through, as I have a penchant for at times, on reflection I wish I had. Would I ever watch it again? Absolutely not. As maligned as ""Showgirls"" has been, it is a far superior version of the impact a new girl into a cut throat competitive career makes."
" Shallow and Beautiful
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,8,"""Neon Demon"" isn't for everyone, but it's wonderful all the same.Set in the high-fashion world of LA (??) ""Neon Demon"" takes its first cue from ""Mulholland Drive,"" starting as the story of a young, blonde innocent played delightfully by a chameleon-like Elle Fanning who is sometimes innocent beyond belief and other times seductive, wise and deranged beyond her years. She meets a ""friend"" in Jenna Malone, who gives the film's most interesting performance as a possibly-predatory, possibly insane Lynchian lipstick lesbian and the movie then moves into Brian DePalma-land, filled as it is with ultra-clean, neon lit sets and the ever-pulsing electronic score. The plot follows Fanning's ""Jesse"" as she moves her way up the ladder of ""success"" in the cutthroat fashion industry and the malevolent forces that seem to be gathering, either to taint her quality or to, literally, feed on it.While the plot isn't all that original (people in high-profile creative jobs can be literal cut-throat monsters, Hollywood is a tough town, the price of naivete is destruction) and the film contains some tiresome, unsavory moments of young women being threatened and dominated by men (and one gratuitous scene with a cadaver that would have stopped the show completely if what followed hadn't been equally outrageous) what makes the ride worthwhile are the 80's-inspired set pieces. Project creator ""NWR,"" whose other films I have not yet seen, tips a hat to Kubrick, DePalma, ""The Hunger"" and ""Cat People"" (to answer the question many have asked as to why a certain scene of an uninvited animal guest appears in the movie). I imagine that's part of the problem...I don't think a lot people who reviewed this film negatively got the ""joke."" I chuckled through the entire movie, and I suspect the director wouldn't have minded. My first clue was the use of a Kubrick homage key word...I can't believe any director would put such a bit of business into a film and expect it to be treated seriously...likewise the Lynchian cameo of Keanu Reeves and Allessandro Nivola. The pace, the characters, the over-the-top fashions, the color scheme (I have a color-blind friend who can vouch that people with color blindness prefer a world that looks the way the film is colored) the retro music score and the nods to other psychological thrillers...I was absolutely delighted to find someone had seen and loved the same trashy films I enjoyed in the 80s and 90s and made a film that not only commemorates those tarnished gems but takes them a step further (I had no idea where the film was going to end up and found the ending satisfying as well as repulsive).This film is not for anyone who has pre-conceptions going in, it's not for those who insist on viewing cinema as an art form of ""literalism"" (""Cinema Sins,"" which I actually enjoy), it's not for someone in a hurry, it's not for someone who wants to see a ""Syd Field 101""-scripted action story with commonplace character tropes. It's female-centric, the politics are left-of-center and the movie absolutely requires you to surrender yourself to the moment and not be in control. It's probably not terribly deep in intent. It has the lack of narrative discipline of a European art film, it's too long and slow, it succumbs to the visually and mentally repulsive on occasion and doesn't provide easy answers...I'm not even sure the movie is asking any questions. It seems like the sole purpose of the movie, like ""Enter The Void,"" is to generate a sensory response, and there's certainly nothing wrong with that. Would that many mainstream Hollywood films today were better at doing that much.When this movie came out I read a lot of reviews saying this movie was ""bad,"" that it was a disappointment, that it didn't live up to the potential created by the director's other films. As usual I took the advice of these reviews and missed seeing the thing in a theater before remembering that often as not the movies that people shout are ""good"" bore me to tears. To re-frame my subject line in a more positive light, if you find yourself liking movies that mainstream viewers don't, this might be one for you to check out."
" An Art Film Short Drawn Out into Two Hours
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,3,"I love all kinds of horror, from the major studio to crude independent productions, from the gore filled to the psychological, from the blatant to the metaphorical. As I fall deeper down the rabbit hole of the horror genre and discover more styles and more nationalities, I am drawn increasingly to the artistic horror film because I'm looking for something different. These movies, though, can be very hard to judge and are usually very divisive. Those who love them will insult the haters' intelligence, while those that hate them love to throw out words like ""pretentious"".Let's get things out of the way, then. There are ways to make artistic horror, with gorgeous imagery and do it well. There are ways to present stylistic moving paintings in your camera shot and still bring the audience a story and a plot that are entertaining. Then, there are movies like this. We can sit here and argue cinematography and camera angles, shot selection and color. The fact is that those things really only matter to an intellectual few who either write reviews for certain zines and blogs, or went to film school and have long since forgotten what made them love movies in the first place.Yes, this movie is gorgeous to behold. I will not argue that with anyone for a moment. There are stunning shots, including the book end shots of the opening and closing segments, very similar scenes that weave images into a tapestry of visual stimulation. I was so intrigued by that opening shot and really thought that I was in for something spectacular, but this movie is full of empty calories. It looks good, it tastes good, it makes you want to come back and sample a little more, but in the end you find that you're still hungry for something with substance.Most of the movie watching public wants a plot. We want some action. I have a degree in Literature and a love of horror. I'm fine with metaphor. I'm fine with hidden meaning. I'm fine with symbolism, but much better film makers have been able to do those things and still bring a fantastic movie, from Argento to Bava to Kubrick, there are ways to bring a visual feast and still fill my hunger with something sustaining. Even the little bit of meaning and metaphor that is here is so boring and mundane. The glamorous world of modeling ultimately devours people. The innocent usually fall when pride takes over. Jealousy is a cruel beast that will inflict deadly harm. These story arcs have been done so many times that they're cliché. Yet, I find so many reviews here praising this guy like he's some sort of genius for putting these thoughts on film.I was really hoping for something like BLACK SWAN mixed with a better version of STARRY EYES. Something that could take that artistic horror spin and use it to really say something or give me something meaningful. This is nothing more than a Calvin Klein television ad, drawn out for two interminable hours, with a brief moment of actual horror tacked on to the end to say that they've given us a denouement. I rarely give ratings below a 5 on this site because most movies don't deserve them. I really thought to myself that I've seen plenty of ""artsy horror"" films get bad reviews on this site and I usually like a lot of them myself, but in this case it deserves every nasty review you've seen and more."

" AWFUL! Avoid this horrible and repulsive style-exercise
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,3,"So, I wanted to watch The Neon Demon, like many other people, because I absolutely love Drive, director Nicolas Winding Refn's acclaimed predecessor. It's one of my favourite movies of the recent years and I have watched it many, many times now. I am not going to watch The Neon Demon again. Ever. In fact, I'm trying to wash some of its images out of my mind. At the beginning, it seems to bear a lot of similarities with Drive. Like the Driver, our heroine is pretty tight-lipped, we don't know much about her past and she has a unique talent, in which she surpasses anyone else. At least, she is given a name: Jesse. We met her shortly after her arrival in LA, where she desires to start a model career. At first, everything looks very promising. She gets a couple of gigs and looks to be the rising star of LA's catwalks. But her success evokes the envy of her competition. And these model- bitches certainly don't hold back, when it comes to fighting their territory. These could have been an interesting plot, if Nicolas Winding Refn had any interest in executing such a thing. But none of the actions of the characters seem to mean anything. I get it, that this is supposed to be very stylized and surreal. But that doesn't mean, that it has to be boring. So many scenes go on and on and on without having any impact for the rest of the movie. Well, a movie can be boring. I mean, this is a problem, but it happens. The problems with The Neon Demon begin, when it starts to counter its own dullness with crudity. In the second half, the movie becomes not only repulsive. It insults the intelligence of the audience.What is it, that NWR wants to accomplish with this style-exercise? Is it a commentary about our own superficial society? Does he criticize, how the fashion industry and we as consumers objectify women? Does it show, how close the beauty and the ugly are? These could be interesting questions, if the movie would make any attempt to answer them. But it doesn't. Instead, it falls victim to its own subject. There is no depth in scenes of rape, necrophilia, pedophilia and what other distasteful obscenities occur in this movie. You have to give them at least some context. The only thing, that is absolutely clear to me: The way, NWR treats his female characters, is plain awful and disrespectful. They are just dehumanized, exchangeable parts in a misguided art installation.In short, after a promising opening, The Neon Demon falls apart very quickly and ends up being a cheap exercise in meaningless provocation and obscenity. It's one of the worst films I have ever seen. Avoid!"
" Don't waste your time!
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,1,"This has to be one of the stupidest movies I have attempted to watch in quite awhile. It made absolutely no sense to me or my Husband.... The only reason we watched it was because Keanu Reeves was in it, and his part is pretty small actually. We really tried watching it and gave up after about 1/2 hour...Terrible script, terrible acting all around...Elle Fanning looked like she was a vapid idiot most of the time...We kept wondering how a 16 year old girl had enough money to live in a hotel, have such nice clothes etc. It just didn't make any sense...Why was there a mountain lion in her room? Did I miss something there, or was that some kind of symbolism for something I was supposed to figure out ? I just could not stand to watch it long enough to find out...We even tried to fast forward it to see if it got any better...It didn't..."
" Don't waste your time.
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,1,"The only positive thing I can think to say about this film is in regards to the cinematography, which is absolutely stunning. Visually, The Neon Demon is a quite beautiful film... But unfortunately, that's all that really I enjoyed about it. The film seemed to pride itself on its symbolism, but never gave much substance plot-wise to make the symbolism mean anything at all. The Neon Demon really did have the potential to make a profound statement about beauty in our society, but it fell far too short to make any sort of lasting impression. As someone who was extremely excited to finally get to watch this movie, my expectations fell flat."
" Nicolas Winding Refn's visual methodology does very little to redeem this grim, incoherently directed gorefest
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,4,"What Nicolas Winding Refn proved in the neo-noir thriller 'Drive' is that he has a hefty hand to both powerful directing and visual storytelling. It is too bad that his following feature 'Only God Forgives' severely lacked the narrative compulsion and characters needed to qualify for an alluring psychological thrilling experience. Following this project is a dark, nihilistic psychological horror thriller that improves upon a few of the blemishes that tainted 'Only God Forgives' from being a quality entry, while maintaining a dazzling visual methodology and cinematography by Natasha Braier. Unfortunately, what lies below Refn's eye-soaking visual heft and gratuitous blood and gore is a direction that lacks certain coherency, and an absent sense of character development. As the story greatly tackles on the dark side of a girl venturing through the modeling industry, Refn's grisly execution is already absurd enough from beginning to end. The problem is the execution is far too depraved of substance to the point where it feels vastly misguided. This stars as Elle Fanning as Jesse, a sixteen year old girl who moves from Atlanta to Los Angeles in a motel run by Hank (played by Keanu Reeves) to embark on her career in the modeling industry. Upon her entrance, she instantly wows modeling manager Roberta (played by Christina Hendricks) and makeup artist Ruby (played by Jena Malone) with her visual beauty and believe she is the ""one"" the industry. As she escalates on the modeling ladder, her success evokes extreme jealously among her fellow competitors Sarah (played by Abbey Lee) and Gigi (played by Bella Heathcote) who stop at nothing to get what she has.As the title greatly suggests, things get pretty ugly, and even describing the plot as ""ugly"" feels like an understatement. Blood and guts are spilled, teen females are exploited, and the film explores the ventures of an adolescent girl through the modeling industry in an aggressively bizarre manner. Similarly to 'Drive' and 'Only God Forgives', the film strolls at a significantly slow pace and explicitly shows how style over substance seems to be Nicolas Winding Refn cup of tea. Refn makes a dashing achievement and flourishing a dazzling, surrealistic visual flair which is beautifully demonstrated in one particular dream-like sequence shot with alluring cinematography. And it sounds Refn really knows how to set the tone of each scene with Cliff Martinez's eerie electronic music core. It's too bad though, that the film takes character development and a sharper story for granted. Front and center of the story is Elle Fanning's Jesse, an aspiring model who brings vast fascination to members of the modeling industry with her striking natural beauty, but nonetheless never amounts to anything beyond a dull, one-dimensional character surrounded in a sea of equally underdeveloped supporting characters. And Elle Fanning's stoic performance brings little justice to the mix. As the story moves on, it slogs through a long tedious (occasionally uncomfortable) stretch of ambivalent storytelling before building up into a preposterous, exploitative gorefest. By the end, it leaves you nothing other than a solid message about the tragedy of turning your natural beauty into an overbearing obsession. The Neon Demon is a nihilistic psychological horror picture that may boasts an inspiring visual methodology, but sadly falls victim to a lack of substance and comprehensible writing, with very little to offer beyond its aberrant psychological material. It is certainly not comfortable to watch especially for those with a weak stomach to excessive blood and gore or overwhelming misogyny, nor does it bring intellect to it's grisly content. In other words, it at least reaches a higher quality than Nicolas Winding Refn's previous entry."
" The Neon Demon review
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,8,"Right off the bat I have to say that this movie isn't for everybody, it has a unique style that may get under your skin, the dialogue is purposely degrading and empty, so you will feel that the characters are empty, but they aren't they tell you more by just being there dressed the way they are than many in dialogue.The Neon Demon is a unique movie expertly made, it is about a rising star in the modeling business and how she reacts to the appraisal. The best part of this movie is the visuals like every movie done by refn, and you can feel that sometimes the story loses because of the effort for the look. The acting is good throughout. So it is a good movie with a unique feel, and Great visuals. 8/10 would recommend."
" A waste of time and one of the worst movies i've ever seen.
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,1,"I really can't believe how many sites list this as one of the top horror movies of 2016. You have to wait approximately 90 minutes for something to happen, then they throw in, statutory rape, necrophilia, and cannibalism. The scenes take forever to get to the point, the visuals even though at times were captivating, doesn't make up for the complete lack of story and any real depth for the characters. This movie made me angry that I watched it. I can count on one hand how many times that has happened. I'm very tolerant and patient and I almost lost my s#$% at the end of this disaster. Please, for the love of cod, do not watch this movie!!"
" not very great
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,1,"It were to seem that this writer and director tried so hard for this awful piece of film to be made. It was tired and drab....so much for trying so hard with visual imagery and eerie long drawn out scenes leading to a sense of the director really trying to show how ""edgy"" and ""Artsy"" he or she is. I want my money back...I want my time back......Unless this is some LA Film School senior project....and even then this film is truly rubbish. The sense of the film was different but it was to seem so contrived and it really showed us a desperate writer and director trying to flex their muscle within their own artistic universe. Simply because you have had success with another film, and you have signed actual A list actors does not mean cinematic Gold. My nephew who is now turning 4 told me a much deeper story today about a dog and his boy. A shame to be out character developed by a 4 year old."
" Like most models, pretty with no substance
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,5,"An absolutely stunningly pretty movie, with no substance. Each shot is poised for elegance and beauty, each interaction with the main character is tense and feels ominous, with a very steady build up ultimately leading to nothing unfortunately. The ending is dissatisfying, given the build up, although it is expected through out the movie as it doesn't really feel like its trying to go anywhere in particular. Sometimes its aiming for psychological thriller, other times horror, other times pure drama. The main characters transformation is strong but doesn't really feel like horror. Missed the mark, but every second is perfect for a cool desktop background"
" Winding Refn needs to stop pretending to be arty .....
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,4,"This Nicholas Winding Refn guy simply elongates scenes and does long tracking shots but none of it amounts to much. And he cannot write any dialog worth remembering. The first frame itself is boring and unsexy. An anorexic scantily clad girl on a couch with blood on her body. Oh wow! How edgy! I am 20 minutes into it and feel like turning it off. If Brian De Palma had so many beautiful chicks, he would have made a very entertaining film.Update: OK! 40 minutes into it now. Thank god I didn't get the blu-ray of this. Refn should stick to music videos or something. The writing is puerile. Some of the dialogues mouthed by Keanu Reeves - jeez! Refn must have written it in 2 minutes. So damn lazy! Frankly, the film had an interesting premise. But Refn is so boringly arty, he forgets to entertain. The leopard in the room, sex with a corpse and scantily clad models strutting around in their bare essentials - all nice ideas, but in the hands of Refn it is all mind numbingly boring. Beautiful? Yes! But boring!There are many beautiful visuals! But cinema is not just about the visuals. That is only one aspect. I'm sure there are people who appreciate this film for the visuals alone. I am not one of them.A word of praise for Elle Fanning. She looked gorgeous and acted quite well."
" 'The Neon Demon' is like Kubrick come back to life.
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,10,"Nicolas Winding Refn has given us some fairly memorable images on the big screen over the years. 'Drive' might be his most successful and most main stream film to date. That film was critically acclaimed and praised by almost everyone. He followed that movie up with 'Only God Forgives' and it didn't do so well, both financially and critically. Refn and his wife even made a documentary about it, but Refn left a sour taste on the film community, at least for a little while. This might have been a blessing in disguise though, as Refn has decided to completely do his own thing from now on.Sure, he has usually never compromised his views or style really, but with his latest film 'The Neon Demon', he does exactly what he wants, how he wants, and when he wants. The result is brilliant. Refn of course is one of those filmmakers who just passionately loves film at its purest state. He's considered one of the big fans of all movies, perhaps with a slight pension towards the bizarre and grindhouse-like style. Refn has pushed the bounds of filmmaking and story-telling with 'The Neon Demon' and has made us excited that we crossed that line with such originality and beauty. For sure, 'The Neon Demon' is a one-of-a-kind movie and dare I say that Nicolas Winding Refn is Stanley Kubrick come back to life.Refn has made a beautiful horror film and satire all at the same time that takes a look at the fashion model world in Los Angeles. It's as if he took what we were all thinking and actually filmed it. Kubrick would have been proud of this film, as Refn perfectly framed and captured every single moment on film that told a story and meant something. The film follows a very young model named Jesse (Elle Fanning), who ends up in Los Angeles by herself, with no friends or family. She is a natural beauty and has just landed a top agency. When she's not out impressing the designers or photographers with her looks, she stays at a seedy motel run by a scum-bag named Hank (Keanu Reeves).Jesse seems like a timid girl, but she has more up her sleeve than she lets on, and not always in the most positive of ways. Due to her natural beauty and innocence, she wins the gigs of all the top magazines, which causes the other older models to lose out on the spotlight and make them bitter and jealous, including Gigi and Sarah (Bella Heathcote and Abbey Lee). A makeup artist by the name of Ruby (Jena Malone) takes young Jesse under her wing, but there is always something off about her in her presentation and demeanor.Through this visual paradise of elegance and ugliness, the story unfolds in a direction that you really won't see coming. When it does happen, Refn goes all out and never stops or flinches away with any of it. 'The Neon Demon' is truly a beautiful yet horrifying film for all the right reasons. The score by Cliff Martinez is fantastic as well and always adds to each moment of the movie's unpredictability and suspense.Elle Fanning is simply fantastic here too, as she portrays someone you really never root for, but at the same time want her to succeed. Keanu Reeves provides some great entertainment and comedy too with Malone, Heathcote and Lee delivering top notch supporting performances. Refn has made an visually stunning film with one hell of a story that could be all too real in this day and age. Again, Refn would have made Kubrick proud with this one-of-a-kind movie experience."
" Visually stunning and a bit of a thinker
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,7,"First of all, the movie is super aesthetic and gorgeous. The use of colors and soundtrack and cinematography and everything was really nice to look at, so if you're really into that sort of art then this movie is worth watching. I've seen so many reviews calling the movie shallow, but I disagree. I think the theme of narcissism in the film is rather complex, especially considering the social context of beauty and selfie- culture and social media and how that promotes vanity and whether or not that is a bad thing. Basically, the film will likely leave you wondering about what you just witnessed, and what was real and what was symbolic and what was insanity.One theme of the film that left me disappointed was the homosexual plot line and how it seemed to demonize homosexuality. In a way I get it and see how it fits into the film, but another part of me is over the stale ""gay people are perverse and/or evil"" trope that exists in the horror genre. It feels overdone and not particularly socially conscious and that part of the movie left me rolling my eyes a bit. Otherwise, the acting was great and there was definitely a couple moment of truly disturbing imagery that made the film worth watching. I would like to see Elle Fanning in more films after seeing this performance.Overall, I think this film is a successful art piece that questions our current social environment in America. I think it's an especially good film for teens and young adults, but the ideas may not relate as well to older adults."
" more of like a sensual and visual experience
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,7,"I finally watched ""Neon Demon"", which I couldn't get a ticket to watch at Tokyo International Film Festival. I recommend you watch this film on a big screen and with audio equipment at a movie theater. It's more of like a sensuous and visual experience than following an elaborated story with many lines. I don't intend to deny adaptations of novels or manga, but I really like this kind of film which must take a form of a film because there have been too many films which derive from the original works recently and I want filmmakers to create their own original works. ""Neon Demon"" is about women in the fashion industry who are obsessed with beauty. If I'm asked what kind of film it is, adjectives such as scary, dark, grotesque would come to mind, but at the same time it's a film about a sad state of those who can no longer live in other ways than being crazy. I almost cried at the end of the film which is quite intense while being overwhelmed by a visual shock. Sia's ""Waving Goodbye"" played for the end credits is good. It matches the film and I got a feeling which slowly spread pains in my heart."
" Visually stunning but poor plot
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,6,"This movie looks and sounds great but other than that it doesn't really have much. I've watched Refn's other work (like Drive and Bronson) and was really disappointed with this one.I think that this movie just wanted to feel edgy. It was a psychological thriller, yes, but I've watched other thrillers and they never left me with these many questions. So many metaphors and hints of symbolism were spread all over the film but it was never revealed what they meant. I understand that most of the film can be left up to interpretation by the viewers but how are we suppose to fill in so many plot holes?As you would expect from a movie called 'The Neon Demon' the visuals are stunning. The bright neon color palette against the dark gruesome environment makes the movie worth watching. The soundtrack is also compelling with its somber tone that really captures the tension that the film tries to give out.Refn applies themes on beauty and narcissism and envy. Viewers can see the emotions that these characters present and understand why they behave the way they do. It's practically an R-rated version of 'Mean Girls'.It was refreshing to see Elle Fanning in a more darker serious film and I'm looking forward to seeing more. Refn has produced great work but I was not satisfied by 'The Neon Demon'."
" Leaving the door open
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,7,"Plagued by strange nightmares, a teenager grows concerned that something is amiss as she tries to make it as a fashion model in this stylish thriller from Nicolas Winding Refn. The film opened to mixed reviews, and between the lurid imagery and self-absorbed characters, it is easy to see why some might not warm to it, but there is a lot of interest here for those willing to bear the film out. A wide-eyed Elle Fanning is perfectly cast in the lead role - in her own words, ""I'm not as helpless as I look"" - and as photographers and fashion moguls constantly praise her natural beauty (versus others with extensive plastic surgery), Fanning credibly transforms from a ""deer in the headlights"" ingénue to a confident and even arrogant young lady. While this results in a hardly pleasant fate, 'The Neon Demon' is a parable first and foremost. A mountain lion that wanders into her motel room early on is a potent metaphor. As the motel proprietor points out, it was her who left the door open for the animal to come in and likewise Fanning's character is undone by letting certain others enter her life. Regardless of whether one gets all the symbolism though, the film makes for a magnificent audiovisual achievement, shot in rich, intense colours with an atmospheric music score. There are some particularly effective sequences where the characters are only illuminated by strobe lighting. Some have criticised the overt horror turn that the movie takes towards the end, but it actually makes perfect sense; the fashion industry does, after all, seem to chew up all new talent and spit them out."
" Beautiful - Stunning - Gut-wrenching
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,10,"With ""The Neon Demon"", Nicolas Winding Refn delivered nothing less than the best movie of 2016. Even when I watched it for the second time, it still kept me on the edge of my seat. Elle Fanning plays a young model, who wants to make her fortune in Los Angeles. Acting like a shy and naive girl, she soon reveals her true nature. The young actress delivers a great performance, making all the other actors seem like amateurs. And we're talking about Jena Malone and Keanu Reeves here.But the true stars of the film are its stunning visuals. Whether it's the beautiful skyline of L.A. or the neon lights and geometric forms of a fashion show, where everything is artificial and just Elle Fanning represents the natural world. Everything about the optic is just outstanding. The music is also great and remarkable. Another strength of this film are the many quiet, intense and sometimes disgusting moments, for example when Keanu Reeves orally penetrates Elle Fanning with a knife or when Jena Malone has sex with a dead woman. Nicolas Winding Refn shows what he needs to show in order, to deliver the overall message of the film, criticizing the sick world of fashion and beauty. This movie is for people, who want to have a unique experience and have no problems with disturbing imagery. For everyone, who is not afraid to see."
" A strikingly filmed, silly parable
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,6,"""The Neon Demon"" is a movie which is at first held together by a flimsy plot but eventually plays like a series of R-rated perfume ads. There is material that might otherwise be shocking, but because we have come to expect the movie to make no sense and push the envelope for no reason, it just plays as silly, pointless provocation.I think ""Only God Forgives"" rubbed a lot of people the wrong way because it seemed to actually be about something, but degenerated into ridiculous affectation that seemed like a cop out, like Refn didn't know how to finish his story so he just threw some weird, disturbing material at us and hid behind the projector with his pockets full of stones.""The Neon Demon"" doesn't even really do that. The plot quits much earlier, so you're not really disappointed in the lack of a conclusion. You just sit, patiently, waiting for the movie to finish. The plot is something to do with a young ingenue who comes to LA to become a model. Everybody is very impressed with her and she appears to meet some hostility from the surgically enhanced, Australian models she meets in a nightclub. She also gets some support from a makeup artist.The idea that youth and beauty are enviable qualities that people in the fashion world will do anything to acquire is hardly news to anybody. Something as well made as this, with as many striking, shocking images, should have put them to the service of more interesting ideas.Further, Elle Fanning is wrong in the lead role. She doesn't look like a top model; she's too natural. If that's the point, why doesn't her character SEEM more natural? She's not really the babe of the woods you might expect.The bottom line is, whereas ""Only God Forgives"" hinted at more around the edges you weren't getting, ""The Neon Demon"" seems comparatively more empty. At least you won't waste too much time looking for hidden meaning."
" I am legit surprised with some hate
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,7,"After watching this film, I seriously thought: I did not like it much. But after thinking a bit, I realized this movie is a one of a kind. The visuals are just stunning and the story, even if confusing, it is really cool. And the end is just shocking but amazing. But there are still some issues: -Sometimes, the movie gets a bit boring and too linear. -Some scenes just do not make sense.They have way too much fantasy.Overall, the movie is shocking, dramatic, ""nasty"" and inspiring. I hope that more movies like this come up and that some directors get inspired with this movie."
" Wow - Utter Drivel
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,2,"The Neon Demon is total drivel, I usually try to find something nice to say and don't usually go overboard with my slagging off, but here goes.There is very few redeeming features in this movie, it deserves everything it gets with both barrels - the characters are boring, the storyline boring, the acting rubbish and its desperately trying to be a David Lynch movie with pretty colours but all we end up with is 2 hours of pseudo-intellectual bullshit. It was a massive waste of my time and will no-doubt be a massive waste of the time for the vast majority of people.I am sorry Elle, you are very pretty but please pick better movies next time - a few more like this one and you will find getting decent jobs very difficult in future. I wish I could give it 1 and 1/2 but two will have to do, I'm sure there are worse films......somewhere!"
" i do not understand the love for this film at all
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,1,"I am truly baffled that this film has a high rating, The positives; Casting is a triumph, not only very good actors, but very attractive and believable in their roles.Cinematography is outstanding,The Negatives;Slow, very slow, in fact, slower than that. Almost pedestrian.Pretentious and meaningless, although the actors are very good, the fact i didn't care what happened to ANY of them speaks volumes about the Direction and Writing.At several points the film seems to try and become a message, a moral, a thriller, then it swings back to lame attempts at horror and eventually dips a very little toe into the waters of soft core suggestive erotica, i've no doubt that the film was intended to be much more than it is, possibly should have been, unfortunately the director seems to get constantly confused as to what the narrative of the film is, therefore losing any cinematic experience. What we end up with is trite, dull, pretentious and annoying, no doubt it will win a lot of ""critics"" awards and admirers, but certainly not from inside the industry itself or their peers. But this is not a film, its a piece of art, at which it truly is accomplished, 10/10, however, this is a movie and a movie website and as such, as a movie, its awful, 1/10.It will be confined to the DVD bargain bin, despite the outrageous reviews on here proclaiming its brilliance. Despite the annoyance and the snobbery within the critique community."
" The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,7,"It is a mistake to consider this a film about the ""evil fashion industry"" ruining some innocent country girl. That is not it. That is not the demon. We get to see quite some Neon alright - a half-colour that appears to carry from fashion and art all the way to dystopian dreams of artificial sheep. It goes well with mirrors. What is the demon though?It's her. She herself pledges guilty. She is dangerous and destructive, sowing sorrow and despair. Although she appears to not do much of anything, everything revolves around her still. The appeal of innocence, mouldability and availability is more decisive than her beauty. Her charms lie in awakened desires that are not to be fulfilled. Like Helena, like the written ""Calista"", she doesn't do anything but rather inspires evil in others. She is victorious. Her essence is contained, spreads its evil seed further and further in consumption.Now this is all pretty neat but is it really the message here? Impressive images are sparsely provided with content, showing that this film was genuinely meant to offer a certain depth while not really closing a container to hold anything. An Abyss? In any case a rather vague series of expressions. The stronger these expressions become the more it feels like a bucking bull ride rather than an arrow in true flight.If his vision is so great I'd consider it sin to not commit further, to not make it digestible to a reasonable degree. Perhaps Nicolas Winding Refn can see far. However: he's not very good at showing his findings to others I am afraid. Hardly any film had so many shallow and obviously wrong interpretations in its reviews, just like hardly any film fails as hard to make a point and get it transmitted. Even if I managed to shed some light here - this is the bare bones, no more. Is there any purpose, any love in these ideas? Is this film good? Yes: there is art in this. The Neon Demon appeals to our hidden desires, to some kind of half-natural animal inside ourselves, in its neon images. It does not leave me satisfied at all. Who knows? Perhaps I am not even supposed to be. Perhaps this film is just as demonic as is its subject.""You must have a cigarette. A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied."" - Oscar Wilde"
" Very good visual wise, plot not so much but that is fine with me. Art 101
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,8,"The visual effects and camera shots are amazing. It is just one of those movies that are aesthetically very pleasing. One could even go so far as to say that the main drive behind this movie is the visual art and not so much plot. The latter can be frustrating for the non 'arty' movie audience. That being said there is one problematic scene (which I will not mention) which makes the movie seem ridiculous. It is one of those 'stupid' irrational horror genre scenes in which the protagonist should call the police instead of doing X or Y. However, when one is wiling to overlook this plot error/inconsistency one can still enjoy most of the movie. Moreover, the movie has some highly disturbing scenes which in my opinion are in line with the Art of film making and symbolism. However, I can imagine that people who are not attuned to this only will perceive it as pure horror instead of 'artistic' thriller, horror as far as there is such a thing."
" Great atmosphere, Confusing (if there even is one) plot
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,6,"Neon Demon is yet another provocative, violent, sometimes disgusting film from director Nicholas Winding Refn. The film stars Elle Fanning as a fresh model named Jesse on the scene in Los Angeles trying to make a career for herself, but also features the creepy guy from Gaspar Noe's Love Karl Glusman as Dean, Jena Malone of Donnie Darko fame as Ruby, and two beautiful envious blondes Bella Heathcote and Abbey Lee, and for some reason Keanu Reeves as a hotel manager. Similar to other Refn films, Neon Demon has beautiful camera work. There are some truly awesome shots in this film. A true standout shot is Elle Fanning's silhouette against her hotel room's wall listening to a possible murder occurring next door. The lighting on this shot is sparse, merely a circle of light on Fanning's figure, but it conveys a great sense of loneliness and fear. Another cool shot involved Jesse (Fanning) in a pure white room, having gold paint rubbed on her body by a photographer. Also similar to other Refn films, the soundtrack is both in your face but enjoyable. Neon Demon's soundtrack is EDM based, with thumping bass blaring throughout many scenes. This makes sense in some scenes, but makes less sense in others. The first half of this movie is fairly slow-moving. Most of the scenes involve Fanning's character making a name for herself in LA, finding modeling gigs, meeting people, hanging out with her boyfriend. Fanning's character is quite innocent and naive early on, until she starts getting gigs and is reinforced in her belief that she is beautiful. Beauty is a major theme in the film. There are multiple conversations on the subject. Early on the in the film two other models make it obvious to Jesse that they envy her natural beauty, telling her that it is unfair. Christina Hendricks also makes a brief appearance as a scout at a modeling agency, letting Jesse know that she could be great. Another scene involves Jesse telling her boyfriend(?) that all she has is her beauty, she's not talented. There are quite a few more conversations on beauty in the film, but you get the idea. These are not particularly deep views on beauty, and are mostly surface level discussions as mentioned above. Where the film does get more interesting, and downright bizarre is its take on envy of beauty. Three characters (Ruby, and two blonde models played by Bella Heathcote and Abbey Lee) in the film have an unhealthy relationship with beauty, and unfortunately take it out on Jesse. From the get go the two blondes are not fond of Jesse (they're jealous), but Ruby makes it obvious that she is quite fond, forming a friendship with her. Things start getting interesting when Jesse gets a great modeling gig and one of the blonde models (Abbey Lee I think) does not. Abbey Lee is in the bathroom and smashes a mirror. Jesse walks in and confronts her. Jesse accidentally cuts herself on her hand on some of the glass and Abbey Lee starts drinking the blood from her hand. This is the first sign that the level of envy is not normal. Things continue to get even weirder when Jesse is staying with Ruby and Ruby makes a move on her and fails. Ruby works in a morgue and applies make-up. She is also apparently into necrophilia, as she commits unspeakable acts with a cadaver while fantasizing about Jesse. The weirdness culminates in Ruby and the two blonde models murdering Jesse and then eating her. There were signs that they were into this sort of thing, such as the scene mentioned earlier with the cut on the hand. Ruby then randomly (but very artistically, this is Refn after all) breaks her water (not sure how) all over the floor while lying down. The movie ends with the two blonde models getting a pretty good gig with a top-notch photographer. Bella Heathcote gets very sick during the gig and has to use the little ladies room. She then barfs up Jesse's eyeball and then stabs herself in her stomach with a pair of scissors, killing herself. Abbey Lee witnesses the whole scene and then decides to eat the barfed up eyeball. That's where the movie ends. These scenes suggest that envy of beauty is so strong in our culture that people will go to great lengths to acquire it, even if that means murdering someone and eating their body. We all see beautiful people in movies, television, magazines, and the Internet. This film focused on the feminine side, and odd departure for Refn. This film is not all too clear on what point it's trying to make plot wise, but it's hard not to watch it to its gore filled conclusion with so much interesting atmosphere, music and camera-work, even if they seem to be all the film really offers."
" no no no
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,1,"Jeez, what a 2 hour rubbish this was.Had to turn it off when it reached the middle realizing there's still an hour of this crap.Firstly, really don't get all the Fanning rage, in each movie I actually got to see with her, the acting is just so poor.The other actors like Keanu must have been paid well to take part in such a thing.Really sad thing happening in Hollywood these days, when models decide they can act.Utterly weird and not in a good way."
" Beautiful but bland
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,5,"The story is so dull that admirable cinematography fails to save it. I was exited to see this movie, but I was disappointed once I saw it. I understand the symbolism that they tried to make with the figure of 'the vampire', and the all the 'beauty' construction but the story still remains flavorless. Characters disappear and they don't even explain it, that is a major issue story wise. The mad construction of the body, in terms of what society considers beautiful or worthy of being called beautiful is in there, as the movie glorifies white beauty it critic's it at the same time. But my problem with the movie is that the story could have been better, the cinematography is too beautiful to be downgraded by such a lifeless story."
" Brilliants Observations of Introspection and the Value of Beauty
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,9,"Refn is not for the faint of heart, but for those who understand him, he's a genius. If you aren't familiar with his other work, start with Drive and work your way backwards to get a feel for how he communicates messages to the audience. For this film in particular, you need to watch with an intelligent eye. Each scene has a voice that delivers a message. You must interpret each scene to follow Refn's eccentric view of the subject at hand. That's his directing style. The message to be heard from each individual scene in this film is simple, but its implications are profound. Refn examines the envy that fuels same sex attraction in straight people--wanting to become the other person because you subconsciously view them as more valuable than yourself. The average viewer may or may not be able to relate to this without a frame of reference. Story-wise, The Neon Demon starts off a bit slow but eventually picks up with some very entertaining scenes. Keep in mind, this movie is a piece of art to be interpreted. The story doesn't have the same pacing as your average Hollywood film, but it is faster paced than Only God Forgives, Refn's previous film.In short, The Neon Demon is an intelligent film for intelligent people. Anyone expecting an easy watch with family or friends is in for a total disappointment, because what they'll get instead is a convoluted cinematic masterpiece."
