" What is another word for word for miserably?
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,1,"It is full of commercials, failed humor, very poor acting and with an empty story. Don't know what was the purpose of making this movie?! Spending the money for nothing? Maybe the only interesting in it was Jennifer, but not enough."
" IGNORE THE BIZARRE HIGH RATINGS!
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,1,"I like Jennifer Anniston and watched this with friends. After a while we agreed that it was just not funny; despite trying very hard to be. The acting is poor, the script poorer. The actual office party is just an excuse to show adults acting in a way that is more cringeworthy than funny: middle aged people acting in lewd, juvenile way, along with bad language (that is an attempt to be funny but falls flat). Everyone trying just a little too hard and failing miserably.Although everything about it screams 'trying to copy the humour of British movies from the 80s/90s, (Bridget Jones, Four Weddings, Love Actually, Notting Hill etc) they just can't pull it off. Those brilliant movies had some bad language, awkward and embarrassing moments etc, but the difference is it came naturally, not forced like in Office Christmas Party. Four Weddings etc also had a fantastic cast and excellent script writer(s) - with a script that was funny.The one funny line? Anniston says to her brother 'All I said was ""do nothing"" and you couldn't even do that'. This was the only part that made the five of us laugh."
" Office Christmas Party
",2020-12-28 00:00:00,6,"6/10 - the writing team and cast on board would suggest that this would be funnier, but it still manages to be some good holiday fun"
" It's about as fun as one.
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,6,"Passable but forgettable festive comedy of nice enough people embarrassing themselves and things getting out of control.There are no jokes per se, just shenanigans and a lot of personality but I don't think I've thought about this more than once since I saw it."
" Laugh out loud comedy
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,10,"How can you not love this film? Just the right amount of dead pan, inappropriate and slapstick comedy. Another winner from the Bateman / Aniston duo."
" Some really funny moments!
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,7,"Great Cast, very nice camera work and some great jokes.You are in the mood for a funny evening and you're a Fan of not quite correct jokes - then go for it!"
" Could rate higher.
",2020-12-23 00:00:00,10,"Watching this for the first time during these crazy times it was just the boost I needed. I have one question, would this be the party that you'd throw if you were told the next day the pandemic would come and we'd all be locked down for a year or so or is this the party we'll all throw when we're finally cleared to throw away masks and social distancing?"
" Whats with all the hate? It made me laugh ðŸ˜†
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,9,Dont understand the negative reviews. My wife and I laughed all they way through it.
" Great actors in a poor movie
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,3,"I rarely if ever say anything negative. Leave that up to the individual. But we were looking for a nice Christmas movie, found this with Jennifer Aniston and thought, yes let's try this one.
Well, if you like debauchery you will like this but we struggled through it looking and waiting for redeeming qualities of humor or heart and found very little to justify calling it a Christmas movie."
" Tackiest movie ever
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,1,"If you wanna be introduced to modern cheap Egyptian movies, you can watch this movie. It is basically the same.
It is still better than Adam Sandler's Halloween movie though, that I couldn't event finish."
" Funny movie, let it entertain you
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,8,"Funny movie, just let it entertain you. Movie is lot better than other office party movies."
" Probably not the demographic for this movie
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,2,"While I do enjoy some awkward comedies & some really stupid comedy, this one was too dysfunctional, awkward and stupid for me. That doesn't mean it won't tickle your funny bone! I am a 59-year-old woman and that may be the problem I have with the movie."
" A bit of a laugh!
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,7,"Don't take this movie too seriously & you wont be disappointed.
Some very stereotypical characters who all go head to head & it actually turns into a gallivanting adventure of timing & event following event. There is a feel good element to this film & Jennifer Anniston comes off well which is a nice thing to see. Other than her amazing role in Friends, she has been in some bomb movies, but she comes across great in this. & I love seeing her cursing. There is a great scene of some minor characters too like the bullsy black security guard & the dykey uber driver. Both wonderful actors. Do watch it. You will enjoy! Another nice way to be Christmasing at the end of 2020 if you are watching it now on tv too. Goodness knows we need a laugh!"
" Great holiday film
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,9,"Built to last (be rewatchable). Lots of character based humour, people being themselves, being weird, self regulated. Munn, Bateman, and a few others smooth out the chaos but overall everyone keeps in character so the film is always grounded and doesn't get lost. Great editing."
" Famous Cast
",2020-12-11 00:00:00,4,"The movie honestly really sucks, but it's full of famous actors so it can be a last resort film around Christmas time."
" An average christmas comedy to watch during the season
",2020-12-10 00:00:00,6,"I normally do not watch a lot of comedies, especially ones where you can tell that they are probably average, with a semi-funny comedic relief, some crazy party shots and a somewhat sweet romantic part. But every once in a while I crave a movie excactly like this. And that is the thing with this movie: You get what you're promised. This movie surely is no cinematic masterpiece but it doesn't strive to be one. It strives to be a goofy comedy and in my opinion, it has achieved that. While some parts are argueably not super hillarious and in my opinion a bit dry and seen before, some parts really made me laugh. I will, however point out, that certain parts where a bit boring or stretched (especially the party scene) and overall the movie seems a bit too long - probably because of the huge cast. The characters are a bit plain but they fulfill their part in the movie. TJ Miller is sympathetic and a bit like a lost puppy, which he portrays very good (he also really has the look to it), Jason Bateman is not really sure whether he wants to be a business man or a hipp adult and Olivia Munn is just effortlessly cool. I enjoyed Jennifer Aniston in this and I honestly really appreciated that they did not give her, neither her On-screen brother a romantic interest and rather focused on their relationship with each other - if there's one thing I hate about typical comedies/romcoms is that everyones redemption is always happening because of someone they were romantically involved with. Also, I am no internet specialist myself but I am pretty sure that Wifi/Internet cannot simply come out of nowhere? And how do ALL these people get Zenoteck, don't they have to be in a contract? And do they have the authority to put their everywair everywhere? As I said I am no specialist but I don't think that it works like that - but of course, this part in the movie exists to give everyone their happy-end and that is okay because that is sort of what we signed up for, right?As I have mentioned, the cast is really huge, especially for a comedy - there are like what, 15 characters we sort of get to know and who play some sort of role? Personally, I would've preffered if they cut out some of them and focused more on the relationships they had with the main three/four protagonists.All in all if you're looking for a movie to watch on a chill night to shut down or with some friends over some beers in the christmas season, this movie brings you what it promises you: comedy, partying, christmas and romance. Oh yes and during the pandemic these party scenes really hit different ;-)"
" Fun, Fun, Fun
",2020-12-09 00:00:00,9,"Hilarious, outrageous, and with a fun ensemble- Office Christmas Party can be a bit messy at times, but for the most part, it's a very naughty and very fun little comedy that isn't afraid to go all out. I've always been an avid fan of Jason Bateman's work, and there is no doubt that he is still very funny in this film. Jennifer Aniston and Olivia Munn also give some good supporting performances, although at least for Aniston, her character is not as well developed. However, despite this talent, I have to say that T.J. Miller was the obvious standout here, as he may not have had as much screen time as Bateman and Munn, but he truly gives his all to every scene he's a part of, and his positive and goofy energy is what makes the film often work so well. That all being said, there are a lot of characters, and is not necessarily tough to follow, but it just feels like filler at times, pointless storylines of characters we have no interest in to keep the film afloat. There are a few formulaic situations at hand, mainly between the family patriarchy that unfolds in the business, but besides a few little things, the film can be rather enjoyable, and very entertaining. It's not the best Christmas comedy out there, but if you're looking for something to make you laugh while also being pretty raunchy, this film is certainly for you.
My Rating: 8.5/10"
" As pleasant as a hangover on Monday morning
",2020-12-06 00:00:00,2,"""Office Christmas Party"" is a 2016 comedy directed by Josh Gordon and Will Speck starring Jason Bateman and Olivia Munn.
âšª
All in all, this foolishly festive feast expectedly doesn't keep what it has promised and is nothing like this one hell of a party that the title suggests, instead, it disappoints by all means, since it is just one poorly conceived and uneventful mess full of infantile, utterly dumb and genuinely unfunny jokes, awkwardly noisy and downright humourless characters and scenes that didn't make me laugh out loud once, and thus it becomes an indescribably terrible, annoying and unbearably stupid waste of money and lifetime that is as pleasant as a hangover on Monday morning at the office.
âšª
After all the good to great films I have seen recently, I knew the day would come that I will be watching a terrible film for a change, and as you can already guess from the conclusion above, it was this one. Admittedly, I knew that I was in for some mediocre and unoriginal feast, since the premise already promised nothing but a formulaic and chaotic Christmas comedy, but seriously, it was even worse than what I expected, and sadly, it was probably one of the most awful ways to celebrate the two-hundredth review this year on my account. However, I don't blame my brother for suggesting this title for this occasion, since he suffered the same way I did, and we are kind of even now. Well ... where do I begin? Honestly, I really don't know what I should start with, cause literally everything in this film is just terrible. Like, what is this premise anyway? The branch manager of an internet infrastructure company decides to throw a huge office party for a client that would keep his branch from being shut down by his sister and CEO, so he spares neither trouble nor expenses to make it the best one the dude has ever seen, but since it is comedy, you can already guess that the plan goes way out of hand. The thing is, this movie doesn't even manage to accomplish the simple task of staying true to its very own simple premise, cause it is anything but that. I was expecting a cheap mix of ""Hangover"" and ""Project X"", a night of excess and insanity, but I cannot explain why, this film is just cheap and absolutely humourless. Aside from Jennifer Aniston (probably the reason that keeps me from giving it a lower rating), you have the bunch of usual faces that are either untalented or simply unfunny in their roles. Jason Bateman, as likable as he is, is nothing but a shallow main character that tries to bring at least a little morality into the film, and even Olivia Nunn as his co-worker/love-interest is tolerable, but aside from that, the other actors and actresses are just cringeworthy as hell. T.J. Miller proves that he is only funny as long as he is a side-character with a few lines, cause as one of the main focusses of the movie, he is just unbearably dull and way out of place. Oh, and then there are other names like Kate McKinnon, Jillian Bell and Rob Corddry who think that they are hilarious with everything they say, even though they are the total opposite of it. Speaking of humour, there is none. As I mentioned above, at the very most I chuckled nervously about how stupid some things were, because, honestly, it has no distinct type of humour, and for a film that runs for almost two hours, it is nothing but pathetic. You have immature yelling, instances of characters acting immaturely and coming a cropper, perverse and distasteful lines, uneventful and monotonous shots of dancing, partying and drinking and ... fart jokes. Yep, you have read correctly - freaking fart jokes. The film ran only for like twenty minutes and has already lost me completely as McKinnon's utterly annoying character let one go. Do people really laugh about it? I mean, come on! The thing is, there are not even events in this mess that are somewhat memorable. Aside from the fact that there are too many irrelevant side-characters that are all equally uninteresting, there is no notable development either. For more than one and a half hours the party goes on and on and on, on the same boring level. Of course, the cinematography at times looks great and knows to capture some ambience, but other than that, there is just plain nothing. Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, it once again proved me wrong, as it neglects its already poor premise and becomes a crime comedy and something in the style of ""Fast & The Furious"". Seriously, Miller's character is kidnapped and later on rescued by his friends, and I just sat there and was like ""What in the name of Santa Claus am I even watching now, and what did I do to deserve this?"". Oh, and the happy ending for all forced romances as well as the future of the company was random and dull as well. Like, the party has been over for hours and you still expect me to be excited about what you have to offer? In the end, it is another one of those films I cannot explain why it has been green-lit. Like, did a group of officials really sit in their conference hall, read through this script and concluded ""That's fantastic! Let's finance this masterpiece with forty-five million dollars!""? It just proves one more time that some studios cast big names in terribly written movies and value money over quality, cause as you see by my example, I believed the trailer and the actors that it was going to be enjoyable. No wonder that nowadays more filmmakers tend to fund their projects independently, cause if big studios rather invested in such disasters instead of really well-written films, I would have no interest in collaborating with them either. Was it that big of a task to produce something that isn't unoriginal and formulaic? Apparently, it is, because this mess is a below mediocre, genuinely unfunny, absolutely annoying and utterly, utterly stupid mess that never should have seen the light of day. I want a refund on both, money and lifetime, because I have wasted both of it - and not even the appearance of Anniston could make up for that!"
" I wish there would be more movies like this one
",2020-12-02 00:00:00,8,I was looking for something to watch and saw this one on Netflix. Did not look like much but it was very funny. So if you are looking for something easy to watch this should be your pick.
" Enjoyable
",2020-12-01 00:00:00,7,The setting isn't optimal - the constant party background gets a little tired after a while. But the characters are good and the story line is not as predictable as most comedies.
" Does what it says on the tin - raucous fun
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,5,"If you've never watched Horrible Bosses, i'd watch this first as it does pale in comparison. Jennifer Aniston has less to go on but still reaches the ceiling of the role. I was excited when i saw kate McKinnon in the credits, but she deserves way more than 'straight-laced, PC minding, HR boss'. But again, she does everything she can with it. It wasn't evident until the end, so i'm not sure but i think there's a huge plot hole that could have been easily avoided. You just have to turn down the expectation meter and then you can enjoy this"
" The Next Party Film
",2020-11-20 00:00:00,6,"Generic Hollywood party film released every year, with a different cast. Premise is fine, a bit predictable, and only really there to base party skits around. But, it's enjoyable enough, there are funny moments throughout, and the cast work well together. Groundbreaking, no. Hilarious, no. An easy watch to keep you amused for an hour and a half, yep."
" Wild Office Christmas Party
",2020-11-11 00:00:00,8,Always great for a laugh when Bateman and Aniston are co-workers
" Decent holiday comedy
",2020-09-27 00:00:00,7,"A branch supervisor sister closes down another branch of his company and cancels his company Christmas party. He goes ahead with it anyway to get a big account. Of course everything gets out of hand and mayhem ensues, and the sister is furious when she finds out about it.It wasn't too bad, with some decent laughs, and the cast works well together. Jennifer Aniston, Jason Bateman, and Olivia Munn are all good in the leads. See this if you need a good ensemble comedy and time to kill.** 1/2 out of ****"
" Easy watch
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,7,"Charming rather than laugh-funny, Office Christmas Party is a character driven romp with good production behind it. Many of the actors were a delight, including Jennifer Allison, a surprising T.J.Miller and Kate McKinnon. I just read somewhere it has an R rating. Not sure why. Bare bottoms on the photocopier? Maybe there was some language I missed. It's not original enough to win any awards, but it certainly won't disappoint either, and should leave most with a feel good."
" very weak entertainment
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,2,"The film didn't entertain me and was boring at times.
It wasn't comedy because it wasn't funny.
The music and the plot were cruelly bad.
Because of the happy end I am generous and give 2/10."
" One Wild Night
",2020-01-26 00:00:00,10,"""Office Christmas Party"" is not your usual, boring, family-friendly Christmas movie; no, it's a fun, coarse, insane ride with a great cast.When Zenotek's Interim CEO Carol Vanstone (Jennifer Aniston) tries to shut down the Chicago branch run by her loose unit brother Clay (T.J. Miller), he, Chief Technical Officer Josh Parker (Jason Bateman) and head of tech Tracey Hughes (Olivia Munn) plan a wild office Christmas party to woo a potential buyer to save the company.What follows is one wild night involving escorts; surprisingly violent pimps; office flings; 3D-printed private parts; an out-of-control HR lady (Kate McKinnon); 'Jesus' riding a horse to a Ronnie James Dio-sung Christmas carol; accidental cocaine use; a tazer-happy security officer (Da'Vine Joy Randolph); and a crazy car chase. The best thing: OCP embraces the craziness and avoids turning into manufactured holiday mush in the third act.It's a lot fun, very funny, and deserves to stand out from the usual Christmas fare."
" Bad Party
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,6,This film starts out very funny and entertaining but by the end just falls flat with all the jokes.
" Good Enough
",2020-01-17 00:00:00,5,"Apart from the party part, the movie was good. It was funny, the idea was good and the romance part was okay. The performances were okay too."
" Office Christmas Party
",2020-01-05 00:00:00,5,"Many people will admit to doing embarrassing things at an office Christmas party, so it is the perfect subject for a deliberately over-the-top festive comedy film, and it makes sense to have an ensemble cast, directed by Josh Gordon and Will Speck (Blades of Glory, The Switch). Basically, Zenotek is a cut-throat technology firm, the Chicago branch's Chief Technical Officer, Josh Parker (Jason Bateman), is finalising his divorce. The company has failed to meet its quarterly quota, and interim CEO Carol Vanstone (Jennifer Aniston) is threatening to lay off staff, cut bonuses, cancel the annual Christmas party, and perhaps even shut down the branch. Her brother, branch manager Clay (T.J. Miller), is desperate to keep his staff. Josh and Clay, along with head of tech, Tracey Hughes (Olivia Munn), propose partnering with financial giant Walter Davis (Courtney B. Vance), to save the struggling company. Walter is pleased with the pitch, but concerned with another recent branch closure at Zenotek, and feels the company is more about the budget than their people. Clay invites him to their Christmas party in hopes of showing him that their company is in good standing. Before leaving town, Carol offers Josh a position at her New York headquarters to which he declines. Clay funds a highly excessive Christmas party, much to the annoyance of Mary (Kate McKinnon), the head of Human Resources. Joel (Sam Richardson) is the evening's DJ, but the party struggles to pick up even with Tracey inviting Chicago Bulls player Jimmy Butler as a friend. Throughout the party, various employees cut loose: Nate (Karan Soni) tries to impress his colleagues Tim (Andrew Leeds) and Drew (Oliver Cooper) by hiring an escort named Savannah (Abbey Lee) to pretend to be his girlfriend; Clay's assistant and single-mom Allison (Vanessa Bayer) attempts to hook up with new hire Fred (Randall Park); and customer service supervisor Jeremy (Rob Corddry) cuts loose on the dance floor with Mary, whom he previously despised. Josh and Tracey get stuck on the roof and nearly kiss before Jeremy interrupts them. While initially reluctant, Walter is inadvertently doused with cocaine when it is accidentally fed into a snow machine and succumbs to his free-spirited nature. Clay wins over Walter's business, and the celebration gradually grows more chaotic as employees begin partaking in orgies, damaging company property, and doing drugs. Carol's flight is cancelled due to weather, and she rushes back to the office when she hears about the party from an Uber driver, who took people to the party. Though Carol is initially impressed with receiving Walter's business, Walter injures himself attempting to swing off a balcony after a conversation with Clay, and is later discovered to have been fired from his firm after his sudden business closure, making the proposed contract meaningless and leaving Zenotek helpless. Carol decides then and there to shut down the branch. She also reminds Josh about the job offer aloud to everyone, especially Clay, although he didn't accept it, the surrounding employees angrily shun him. Clay leaves to find another party and rushes off with Savannah's emotionally unstable pimp, Trina (Jillian Bell), who is more interested in robbing Clay of his wealth that he is actually keeping on his person. Josh, Tracey, Mary, and Carol race off to save Clay. One of the guests learns that the branch is being terminated and convinces everyone to throw out and destroy all the company equipment and burn everything in sight, forcing security guard Carla (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) to stop the unruly, now destructive and rebellious party. Clay with Trina's group and Josh with his group end up in a car chase together, and a near attempt at a jump over an open bridge gap. Both end up crashing into each other and causing a power outage across the entire city. Trina and Savannah are arrested for their crimes, while Clay is taken to the hospital. In the wake of the internet blackout, Tracey realises how to run a new innovation she's been working on for several years that combines internet Wi-Fi with wired connections through the city's power grid, which had previously failed due to real-world interference of the existing internet signals. They race back to the destroyed office to set up her tech, and when it works, internet is restored to Chicago. This new innovation saves the jobs of the entire team, with Clay apologising for how his father treated Carol. Walter, in the same hospital as Clay, agrees to join the team, while Josh and Tracey kiss share a kiss in the ruins of their office. Jeremy opens up to Mary, and Nate and Allison agree to go on a date. The whole group meets Carol and Clay as he's released from the hospital, and they all go out for breakfast, driving recklessly on the way. Also starring Jamie Chung as Meghan, Chloe Wepper as Kelsey, Matt Walsh as Ezra, Ben Falcone as Doctor, Fortune Feimster as Lonny and Michael Tourek as Alexei. Bateman, Aniston, Miller, McKinnon, Corddry and the other recognisable stars all play their parts, there is not very much in the way of a story or plot, but it doesn't matter, it is all about the chaotic behaviour as the staff get drunk and high, engaging in embarrassing and humiliating behaviour, there is even the traditional photocopying of body parts, it is likeable enough, a reasonably funny seasonal comedy. Worth watching!"
" Yucky
",2020-01-01 00:00:00,1,A complete waste of time. I don't understand why Aniston accepted to play a role in this nonsense script.
" Easy to watch holiday film
",2019-12-29 00:00:00,7,"If you're up for some light hearted fun then Office Christmas Party is suitable. No need to analyse it and overthink it. The idea of having an office party to save a company is outrageously funny. Its the holidays, the end of the year and time to unwind. This film captures the carefree nature of the year and festive season. So sit back and enjoy the silliness and mindless humour. 7/10"
" not much cheer heer
",2019-12-24 00:00:00,6,"Awkward, unfunny, and irritatingly PC, for an hour or so this could almost pass for a BBC Christmas film. After that it just goes crackers. Laughs are thin on the ground except for a short but fun scene between Jennifer Aniston's ballbreaking boss and a hapless little girl. And the worst flaw is that the party itself only seems depressing.Similar territory was covered much more entertainingly and upliftingly in Sisters."

",2019-08-17 00:00:00,7,"Sigh. Looking at the recent reviews here, so many people rate Office Christmas Party a '10' or a '1.' Uh, no. How about 'no?' It's not a '10' (which would be pretty much a masterpiece) nor is it a '1' (which would be pretty much the worst film ever made).What it is, is this: a harmless comedy that knows what it's supposed to be and doesn't try to be more. The title basically gives it away, too. It's about some execs throwing an office holiday party, but with a twist: they are doing it to save their jobs. (You'll have to watch it to find out why.) There are some genuinely funny moments, but there are some jokes that don't really land, and that's fine. Overall it is fairly entertaining and you're not left checking the time to see how much longer it has to go. That's not a '10' but it's definitely not a '1' either. It was what I thought it would be: familiar comedic actors 'hitting the mark' often enough to keep it funny and move the film along. And that was good enough for me. 7/10."

And I am not even a bit rigorous person.This film is so much fun is actually the most creative film ever portraited. The two obese on the movie are the only thing wrong with it, as they are what is wrong with this world.I got to a point where I thought I would finally enjoy christmas movies, the next one I'd ever know of, because I used to reject the idea of them and just felt like it. I thought it was not creative. The idea of christmas i didn't like for quite a while, but now I love it. Now means a long while before watching this movie, but after watching it feels even better. Didn't want this last phrase on my review, well, that is sweet though.This film is so much fun I write this review while it is paused. Now this is definitely what should't be here.

Jennifer Aniston was the hook for it, because it is the only moment when she is seen on this movie (and 2 more unfunny ones).

Any boss could have set up the premise, and would have been better if she'd just left then.The logistics of the party setup and getting it to start from the boring beginning were among the most entertaining. Stretching that out, then finishing with signing the big deal, and saving everyone etc. would have worked fine.But then they left the office. Why? It's even called Office Christmas Party. Stay there. We've seen a number of these road trip/bad-part-of-town adventures with the same people. Why do the same basic gag again here?"
" This one is funny
",2019-02-06 00:00:00,8,"And you will laugh and enjoy, Boy I wish I was at that party. The sexy parts are sexy and Jennifer Aniston is a hot bod! Yummmm"
" I had a lot of fun with this surprisingly anti-pc holiday season comedy
",2019-02-03 00:00:00,8,"I had a good time with this one. The script is funny, with some good lines coming out of nowhere that catch you off guard. I expected a lot of the cast, and they didn't disappoint.In the bloopers in the end it's clear how much some of the cast were improvising on the spot, pretty awesome if you ask me. I found Courtney B. Vance's part especially funny, as he normally plays serious roles it was refreshing to see him in a funny role.All in all, you can't go wrong with this one!"
" Terrible film
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,1,"Absolutely awful. Boring, predictable, unfunny rubbish."
" Garbage
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,2,Garbage... scary but true but lots of people in this society are like this.
" A lot of laughs, but predictable
",2018-12-25 00:00:00,6,"This is a fun movie and we've added it to our holiday movie traditions. Lots of laughs and while it's not the best film, it serves its purpose. There were plenty of belly laughs and silliness. A great way to relieve the stress of the season."
" If you like too laugh check this out.
",2018-12-16 00:00:00,10,I was blown away by how funny this movie was. Kate McKinnon is absolutely hilarious. Jason Bateman nails his usual responsible but funny role. This movie really had me laughing out loud.
" Unnecessarily vulgar
",2018-12-16 00:00:00,5,This movie was ok for awhile and then it took a turn into the sewer and stupidity. Don't watch unless you have a high tolerance for dumb.
" Good fun
",2018-12-05 00:00:00,8,"This was a great ride!!
Love Bateman in pretty much most comedy roles, so it wasn't a stretch for him to be awesome in this too! Everyone else either played a great comedic role or a very weird role...either way, all the cast delivered and brought some good fun to the party, literally!
Sure there were some really crude parts and OTT parts...but that's what tends to come with these kinds of genres, so you've just gotta go in with an open mind and not get offended.
I know people who get offended at another Bateman favorite like Identity Thief, but I absolutely loved that, was laughing myself off the seat the whole time. It's just good comedic escapism...and isn't that what we watch this stuff for?
This flick didn't have me laughing as hard as that one...but there were some funny moments and even when I wasn't full on laughing, I was still very entertained!
Oh, i laughed hard when that can burst into that guys face, virtually at the beginning...as that's something that could actually happen!
So, I recommend"

" Telling a little girl FU is not funny
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,1,Really? That's supposed to be funny? This is a Christmas movie. Maybe mommy is doing drugs in the bathroom. Maybe the little girl is lost and that's why she stole Anniston's cinnamon roll. But threatening her doll and saying FU to her is where I shut this piece of crap off. When did mean become the new funny?
" Yet another great Bateman comedy
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,8,"Wow, what a great comedy and a dream come true office Christmas party to be :)I've always liked Bateman's comedy films, but i think this might be the greatest. Not to take anything from the other actors, good performance from all around the cast.Not going to get the full 10/10, but still a good 8/10, was just missing something, i can't tell what. Must see Christmas movie."
" He'll of a Party
",2018-09-28 00:00:00,7,This film did make me laugh in places. Take your brain out and enjoy the silliness. It over the top but it left me with a smile. After all it is the season to be jolly.
" No selfrespect
",2018-09-12 00:00:00,2,"I would have payed good money to make sure this movie wouldn't get released if I was one of the respectable actors in this movie.I can't imaging anyone in the movie feels good about anything in the movie. Even the ""extra's"" should keep it a secret.Maybe the first 15 min. but it's straight downhill from there.It should feel like waking up next to something horrible after a night you drank so much you don't even remember where you started when you were still sober. I feel ashamed just to have even watched it. The 2 is for the dirst 15 minutes I rounded up from a 1.5."
" Not funny haha
",2018-09-09 00:00:00,5,Terrible premisse of a story that is too strange and absurd to work. Bad boys and girls with lots of money trash the place. Hard to find the good in it and little humour as well.
" Typical
",2018-09-07 00:00:00,2,"Jason Bateman awesome as always. 
Jennifer Aniston awful as always. 
And Karan Soni's character is annoying within five minutes."
" Ignore these bizarre bad reviews
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,8,"They really don't know what they're talking about. Hilarious Hard-R screwball comedy, smart, wonderfully acted, tight script, with funny improv from a lot of talented actors with solid comedy cred. It's a party blowout movie. Bachelor Party. Can't Hardly Wait. Superbad. Old School. It's like that. A great way to spend a couple of hours."
" Its fun if you let it be fun
",2018-06-17 00:00:00,7,"I understand why people might be down on this movie but I really enjoyed it. It had the right elements of the great party comedy. Great cast. Great party. Maybe I really enjoyed it because I was drinking along with it and wanted it to be good. But is that such a problem to have?
It did feel like it couldn't quite hit the punchline as well as I wanted it to. But if you want to have fun with it you will."
" I mean.....
",2018-05-28 00:00:00,6,"It's not really funny, there are some funny parts, but you won't laugh through the whole movie. It is something to watch when you are bored, and it's always worth watching when Jason Bateman is involved."
" A fun flick
",2018-05-23 00:00:00,8,"This one doesn't pretend to be more than it is. Light to medium comedy with great cast, mix of OK gags and some clever lines. 
Some reasonable writing and again - a great cast hold it together and leave you with a smile on your face. Pretty good sound track too."
" Really?
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,4,"It had a few laughs in the beginning, but was repetitive later on. It was mostly flat and boring. It was just an excuse to be rated R with no real timing or buildup. What a lousy comedy for the holidays."
" The two stars are for Jennifer Anniston
",2018-05-17 00:00:00,2,"Jennifer Anniston absolutely carries this movie, No wonder she looks so exasperated on the cover! Turned it off 40 minutes in, just no laughs I'm afraid."
" Indifferent comedy
",2018-05-16 00:00:00,7,"Josh works for a software company, supervising hot Tracey, and answerable to idiot boss Clay who is, in turn, answerable to iron lady older sister Carol. Carol's threat to shut the branch down pivots on getting an important order from Walter Davis which they determine to achieve via reinstating the office Christmas party which Carol cancelled.What can I say? If I add that the office is populated by weirdos and cranks, then you can probably fill in the rest of the movie yourself. Suffice it to say that everyone plays exactly the character you expect them to: Jason Bateman is the easygoing everyman schmuck Josh, TJ Miller is the profoundly irritating idiot Clay, Jennifer Aniston turns in another lazy cookiecutter performance as Carol and, as she did in Ghostbusters, Kate McKinnon completely steals the show.It's not without chuckles, but it has an undeserved air of likeability to it which is almost entirely due to Bateman.The happy ending derives from Aniston's character having an unbelievable and dramatically unjustified 180-degree personality change as the end of the movie approaches (see also: Christina Applegate in Bad Moms, Melissa McCarthy in The Boss etc.).In short, the entire movie is lacking in credibility even allowing for the hyperbolic personalities demanded by movie comedies.And it's very sweary. Some is OK - funny, appropriate to the situation - but much of it adds nothing apart from gratuitous offence."
" From Office Politics, To Office Party Tricks.
",2018-04-29 00:00:00,5,"Jason Bateman is awesome with comedy, and he has his own type of style, and it comes through with this movie too, however, not nearly as much as one would prefer.Olivia Munn is a hon, Jaime Chung is hot, T.J. is exactly who he always is in every movie he's in and Jennifer was okay. The script got lazy at some points, dry at others, however there were some pretty funny lines and moments here and there, sadly though, the type that upon a second watch, would probably fall way flat.The ""anywair"" concept was quite cool though, but again, sadly it felt wasted on a story that was never going to utilize it nearly as efficiently as it could or should. Also, the romance between Josh and Tracey was, uninteresting.Office Christmas Party was okay all around. It's nothing special, but there definitely is worse out there. 5.3/10."
" Office Space.
",2018-03-28 00:00:00,5,"With Christmas coming up,I spoke to a family friend to ask if he had recently picked up any new X-Mas flicks. Charmed by the scenes they share in the Horrible Bosses movies,I was happy to learn of another Jennifer Aniston/Jason Bateman team-up,which led to me getting set for the end of year office bash.View on the film:Throwing out the set-up within the opening 20 mins, the screenplay lets it snow with an improvised atmosphere, via the extended office party follow various sets of guests in an episodic-style. Whilst this format allows for a number of raunchy punch-lines, the thin plot leads to the movie stagnating,due to there being little options for progression in the relationships of the workers.Attempting to save their jobs with a wild party, co-directors Josh Gordon & Will Speck deck the halls with glittering neon lights that shine an anything goes,free for all atmosphere on the event. Joined by a sassy Abbey Lee as Savannah and a dead-pan Kate McKinnon as Mary, Jason Bateman and Jennifer Aniston give the flick a much-needed glass of festive cheer as Carol Vanstone and Josh Parker,thanks to Aniston and Bateman retaining their snappy black comedy delivery from their past team-ups,which they unwrap at the office X-Mas party."
" Office Christmas Party continues the annual trend of drunken shenanigans during the holiday season.
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,5,"It's literally what you expect it to be. An office Christmas party where it goes slightly chaotic towards the end (like all parties should do). The company that our characters work for is undergoing some radical changes by the manager's sibling who is a CEO filled with tyranny and bitterness. In order to save the company, they come up with a plan of throwing a Christmas party for a rich prospect. As always though, things get out of hand. I will say this, it's perfectly enjoyable and fine to watch. Yet the same issues occur with the likes of ""The Night Before"" and ""A Bad Mom's Christmas"" where it just feels too random with no focus on a cohesive plot. Don't get me wrong, watching a drugged up man swing from a balcony holding onto Christmas lights is a good time. Even the malicious CEO cursing and destroying the Christmas magic in front of a little girl is amusing. However, when the characters and plot are so bland and formulaic you can't help but feel disconnected. It's another case of random scenes are strung together to gross you out or make you laugh, seemingly more fit into the former category. That, for me, does not make a coherent narrative. Not to mention the various office employees that the plot tried to incorporate. A newly hired worker who has a fetish, a boss who hires a prostitute for the night, an employee who pretends (badly!) to be a DJ...a plethora of minor characters, not enough focus on a substantial plot. If you like your comedies random, then you are sure to like this. Oh, then the typical conclusion arrives where everything is fantastic again. Yay. Merry Christmas. Jason Bateman plays the same character in everything, Olivia Munn was the funniest, Jennifer Aniston was surprisingly good and TJ Miller was fine to watch. The acting was just fine. A few witty lines from the script, but most of the comedic moments are visual. Like I said, it's a fine film but an utterly forgettable one due to its lack of structure and infrequent laughs."
" Stay very far away from this movie
",2018-02-05 00:00:00,1,"So you don't have to waste much of your time reading this review, and vicariously thinking about this movie, I'll cut to the chase. Unless you're a partying frat boy who spends most of his time on some kind of substance, you should stay very far away from Office Christmas Party. As I am not a partying frat boy, you might be wondering why I watched this terrible movie. I was suckered in by the ridiculous weakness of forcing myself to watch every Jennifer Aniston movie in the world. I thought, since she and Jason Bateman received top billing, it was going to be a Christmas edition of the Horrible Bosses films, which I did find funny. It had nothing to do with those movies; it just happened to take place in an office. Remember that group of boys in college who made student films over the weekend when they were drunk or high, and on Monday when they'd show their creation in class there would be the silence of crickets except for the creators themselves? They'd be giggling hysterically in the corner, remembering how funny their jokes and pratfalls had been at the time. And for some reason, they didn't understand or care that no one else thought their movie was funny, so they went out and did it again the next weekend. Office Christmas Party is a feature-length version of those terrible college videos. More than half the movie takes place at the party itself, and everyone drinks and does drugs to excess. The ""shenanigans"" the cast performs isn't at all funny to a sober audience who wasn't there at the time of the filming. Much as it breaks my heart, I'm forced to believe everyone involved in this movie has very bad taste.Unless you want to see the voice of Mr. Mucinex in his natural human form, I can't imagine any other legitimate reason for wanting to watch this movie. And I urge you to restrain yourself and content yourself with the preview. You'll only waste two minutes of your life instead of two hours."

" Funny Christmas Movie
",2018-01-08 00:00:00,7,I was looking to watch a funny Christmas movie that isn't Elf or A Christmas Story so I gave this a chance since I really like Jason Bateman and I can say I was entertained throughout the whole thing. It's not the greatest movie ever but it checked the boxes I was looking for while watching. It's definitely stupid humor but it gave me a few good laughs
" a big stinky poo
",2018-01-04 00:00:00,3,"A typical American comedy consisting of weed jokes, beer jokes, cocaine jokes, and all of that. On a technical stance, the film has nothing for me to talk about. It's shot fine, it's acted fine, it's directing is fine, although the script is awful.There's this ""joke"" where some parents are taking their kid away from the party, and the dad says something like, ""We gotta go quickly, these edibles will be kicking in any second. Okay. So what's the joke exactly? Is weed just automatically funny?The film has nothing to offer, and no kind of style. Do not watch this movie."
" Decent throw-away Christmas comedy
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,6,"'Office Christmas Party' does what it says on the box - it's a comedy revolving around a workplace Christmas Party in Chicago. It used to be a family business, but now Clay (Miller) runs the office and his sister Carol (Aniston) is trying to shut him down. Josh (Bateman) is the CTO and Tracey (Munn) his IT head/love interest. To boost morale, Clay, Josh & Tracey decide to have a huge Christmas Party - and the debauchery ensues.The support cast is pretty great - Mary from HR (McKinnon, in a terrible Xmas jumper), Jeremy from Customer Relations (Corddry, always funny), Fred from Accounts (Park, with his weird fetish) and Nate from IT (Soni, almost his same cab-driver character from 'Deadpool', great to watch), plus a crazy pimp (Bell). The plot is pretty thin and padded with a car chase and the typical ""rave to some techno"" scenes. The ""love story"" between Josh & Tracey is almost non-existent.It's the same directors that bought us 'The Switch' with Bateman and Aniston, but it's nowhere near as fun or inventive as 'Horrible Bosses', or last year's 'The Night Before' - and as far as ""adult"" Christmas films go, not even close to 'Bad Santa'. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments, and a few good jokes thrown in, but often it seems like it's being crude or stupid for no reason."
" Garbage.
",2017-12-31 00:00:00,1,"Office Christmas Party is one of the worst comidies I have ever seen. There is no plot, except for swearing. Why do the writers need swearing to make a show funny? Do they have nothing better to say? The acting is terrible. Jennifer Aniston acts like a spoild brat. The other actors act like they are trying to hard to be funny, when they are not. DO NOT WASTE YOUR 1 HOUR AND 40 MINUTES THAT YOU WILL NEVER GET BACK WATCHING THIS FILM. It is a disaster."
" Funny and fun
",2017-12-25 00:00:00,7,"It is a few days to Christmas but you wouldn't really know it at the Chicago branch of Zenotec. Due to political correctness and the overzealousness of HR, there is very little in the way of celebrations. A quiet get-together is arranged but this is cancelled when the uptight, money-is-everything CEO (who happens to be the branch manager's sister) puts the kibosh on it. She also intends to retrench 40% of the staff at the branch. In a last ditch attempt to save the staff their jobs, the branch manager tries to land a major client. In order to show the client that they're not cold and uncaring, he (without his sister knowing) throws a huge Christmas party, and invites the client. Things could get rather festive, as long as HR don't have anything to do with it...Funny and fun. I had low expectations for this movie. It looked a lot like the silly sort of thing that Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill and/or James Franco would appear in. The fact that it starred Jason Bateman (and not Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill or James Franco) gave me some hope and from the beginning, the hope was vindicated.Turns out the humour is quite irreverent and non-PC, even anti-PC, (just the way I like it) and reasonably clever in that regard. Definitely not a movie for the easily offended, especially find-an-offense types (even more reason to like it).It does get a bit predictable and silly towards the end but the first act was excellent and if that sort of quality had been maintained this could have been a classic comedy.Good for a laugh, plus for pointing out how stupid companies (and individuals) have gotten in their aversion to Christmas celebrations."
" Forced stereotypes, and a wasted (not in a drunk way) cast
",2017-12-24 00:00:00,3,"Given this is Jennifer Aniston and Jason Bateman fifth time together, you'd think they'd change their roles up a bit. He's the corporate lackey, playing it safe and trying to get people to play nice. She's the hard-assed boss, determined to make his life hell! In this case, she's a CEO threatening to shut down his branch,
All the standard stereotypes are here; the boss (T.J. Miller) who inherited the company, having done nothing to earn that position. The HR head (Kate McKinnon), so buttoned up she spends her life enforcing the rules,. An IT supervisor (Karan Soni) with seemingly no control, whose attempts to impress his subordinates backfire. And Jason Batemans character has a smart and attractive colleague (Olivia Munn), with an unrequited relationship backstory.
And you know that by the end of the film, these misfits will have saved their jobs and probably end up in relationships, all because they got drunk and allowed their colleagues to see them in a different light (and all with only positive, not negative consequences).It's a shame, given the list of stars, that the film just doesn't work that well. The main four characters - Miller, Aniston, Batman and Munn - pull it along, with everyone else following their lead. Even McKinnon (possibly the best thing about the last Ghostbusters) is reduced to fart jokes.Those at the party probably woke up feeling like people who watched to the end of the film."
" The sleeper hit of the Netflix holiday offerings
",2017-12-23 00:00:00,8,"I'd never have rented this based on the blurb, and for the past few weeks I ignored it on Netflix. But tonight I gave it the 10-minute test. Ended up glued to the tube. This is the sleeper of the season for Netflix holiday comedy offerings, that might be especially made for SNL fans. If you like movies like 'Rare Imports' and 'Get Santa', take this American offering for a test drive. A slow start, a bit clunky on the early ensemble work, but brother when it hits its stride it is meta-hysterical. During the run-up to the bridge, with the glorious Christmas anthem in full orchestral splendor, I damned near stopped breathing. The outtakes after the credits are a mni-van full of wit and sass.***RATED R AND EARNS IT!!! (there is some really gross stuff in this but they don't dwell on any of it; I've heard the amazing comedic cast improv'd a lot).Not suitable for Family watching."
" Stupid as hell
",2017-12-22 00:00:00,1,"Watching this movie is total waste of time. Stupidity, violence and bad actors."
" Nothing new, nothing funny
",2017-12-21 00:00:00,1,"The format of this film is played out. The writing is poor. The jokes are forced and actually not funny at all. The cast is great. It feels like they really rushed to make this film so nobody seem to try hard, its more like they are reading the script on the set. Some of the jokes are very immature and embarrasisng to watch. 
The story line is nothing new. Just go watch any feel good comedy movie and you have basicly the same build up. If you are like me, try this movie out. If you havent laughed the first 5 minutes than you wont laugh the rest of the movie."
" Grossly Underrated
",2017-12-16 00:00:00,8,"I don't understand why people can't embrace a movie like this. It's silly, it's fun, and it's awesome to enjoy when you want a laugh. It's a great cast too, with a lot of fantastic comedic actors.People complain about the script. Personally, it's good enough for me to make the jokes work. If you're looking for a deep and meaningful story, this isn't it. If you want to relax and laugh, and enjoy a good Christmas movie, this is awesome."
" Enjoy It For What It Is
",2017-12-07 00:00:00,5,"This movie has received some really bad reviews, and rightfully so. Its main crime is taking a very talented cast (Jason Bateman, Jennifer Aniston, Olilva Munn, TJ Miller, Kate McKinnon, and Rob Cordy) and just wasting them. With a less stellar cast, you could maybe forgive its shortcomings as people trying really hard. But with this cast of both standup and comedic actors, it should have been much funnier.The biggest crime, as with most failed movies, is it can't decide what it wants to be. Is it a office comedy in the vein of Office Space or is it a gross out comedy like American Pie, or an over-the- top comedy like The Hangover? The movie never settles on one and it fails at all of them.Miller is the spoiled brother of Aniston. Their rich father has died and left them in charge of the company. They don't like each other. Bateman is the IT supervisor for the company and best friends with Miller. Munn is his whiz kid subordinate and potential love interest. McKinnon is an HR rep and Cordry is an office worker. Aniston is the CEO and she wants to shut down the branch of the company run by Miller. Some of it is out of spite and some out a true desire to see the company succeed by cutting costs. She promises not to shut them down if they can land a big account by the time she gets to London on a Christmas Eve flight. That sets the stage for a massive office party designed to impress the rep from the company whose business they need to land.Much like an SNL episode, this is a series of individual set pieces. They are tentatively held together by the idea of the office party. Nothing really makes a lot of sense and the plot has gaping holes in it. The sentimental wrap up was forced, at best.Now, having said all that, I actually kind of enjoyed it. I've always liked Batemen and I have a huge crush on Munn, and their scenes have some great chemistry. Aniston is really coming in to her own as an actress since Friends ended. Her character could have been better written, but her scene in the airport with the little girl and her arguing with the Uber driver had me busting up laughing. Miller can be funny in small doses, but his character just got mind numbing after a while. The plot didn't really have a lot of teeth but some of the individual scenes were funny and you can really see a good comedic film was in there somewhere.This needed a steadier hand directing it than two guys who didn't seem to grasp what makes a comedy a classic."
" there really wasn't a point to this movie
",2017-12-03 00:00:00,4,"The biggest problem with this movie was it was pointless. The gist is up-tight sis, Carol, visits her brother at the company branch in Chicago. She tells him he has 2 days to increase sales by 12 percent or they will have to fire 40 percent of the employees. So, her brother, Clay, and his compadres throw a Christmas party against Carol's wishes in order to impress this guy whom they are trying to sign to a contract.So they through a huge party at the office, hundreds that aren't even employees show up, and some how Clay is taken by this lady pimp. In his rescue, the internet is wiped out in the entire city. And employee Tracey comes up with some idea that made no sense but restores internet and this some how saves the company. I didn't get that part.FINAL VERDICT: Not very good, skip it."

He sells internet servers at Zenotek's Chicago branch under reckless head Clay Vanstone (T.J. Miller). Vanstone's dead father used to run the company.

Parker, Vanstone, and Tracey Hughes (Olivia Munn) have to save the day by getting a contract from Walter Davis (Courtney B. Vance). Despite Carol canceling the office Christmas party, they throw one anyways to entice Davis. Mary (Kate McKinnon) is the strict HR lady and Jeremy (Rob Corddry) is her mortal enemy. Meghan (Jamie Chung) refuses to dress appropriately. Allison (Vanessa Bayer) is the single mom looking for love. Fred (Randall Park) seems like a nice guy but hides a secret kink. Nate (Karan Soni) gets teased for his imaginary girlfriend and hires prostitute Savannah (Abbey Lee) from pimp Trina (Jillian Bell). Joel (Sam Richardson) surprises by being the DJ. Carla (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) is the sassy security guard.The cast is comically solid. They are all doing well but the movie may be overloaded. The vast cast follow their own plot in the chaos of the party. It needs to tie the specific group into one plot, mainly trying to seduce Davis. The plot needs to be solely going in that one direction to give the movie structure. The final plot resolution does feel like an older comedy where something magically saves the day. While the group is full of great comedic talents, the movie lets them scatter to do their own side plot instead of concentrating on the main plot."

Bateman, Aniston, Miller, Kate McKinnon, and Rob Corddry can make any script a success adding their own improvisation. Add Olivia Munn for support and you have a solid cast. I had a number of laugh out loud moments. It is a film that gets funnier as it goes along and doesn't drop off a cliff into some sad drama with a point. Kate McKinnon stole every scene she was in. While it was adult entertainment with adult language and sex talk, it wasn't teen sex comedy stupid and obscene.Guide: F-word. Brief nudity. No sex."
" Awesome fun!
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,9,"OK, I can rarely be bothered writing reviews but the other reviews for this are so far off the mark I feel compelled to. I am really finding IMDb reviews to be a gross misrepresentation of the quality of a film due to the muppets that give it a rating of 1/10 and drag the overall rating down. The reviews of so many films are so off the mark I can no longer use IMDb as a reliable gauge of the quality of a film.....Seriously, if you give this 1/10 you have so completely missed the point it is ridiculous. It is based on a SNL skit and has some hilarious performances from some quality actors-Jason Bateman, Olivia Munn and Jennifer Anniston shine in this and my wife and I had at least 6 genuine laugh out loud moments.Yes, it is a bit absurd and some of the laughs are a bit 'cheap' but if you don't find this amusing you either have no sense of humour or take life far too seriously. Get over yourself!"
" Modern Holiday Classic that I will enjoy for Christmas's to come!
",2017-07-12 00:00:00,8,"I could kick myself for not catching this in theatre's during the holidays. I am however glad I caught up and saw it recently. Funny from beginning to end and less cheesy than a lot of holiday comedies. Of course there is some exaggerated save the day through the internet jargon at the films end but this is comedy people come on! The entire cast was a blast from start to finish highlighted by TJ Miller. Set in the atmosphere of the kind of parties that companies just can't have nowadays. Jason Bateman, Jennifer Aniston, Olivia Munn and supporting cast were excellent. In this holiday film that like Bad Santa was underrated upon it's release should be getting it's jest due in years to come."
" Really Funny Movie for Office Workers
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,9,"The negative commenters are welfare couch complainersGET A JOB!THIS MOVIE ROQED!Can't wait to see the follow up movies.Office people letting loose, a dream all employed share.. To get down and dirty with your coworkers.Now basically it is all fake, its a movie a satire on the real working world.Watch without expectations but to laugh, maybe not constantly uncontrollably unless your off your meds.Great repeat-ability as each character resembles a coworker you know.Its crass, rude, perverted, and characters narrow minded..That's the point of a comedy, people that are too unreal... Yet these characters really are like real employees off their meds too.If this movie doesn't make you laugh, you have no funny bone and should seek counseling and looser therapy sessions.This office is where i want to work.They have a good thing going and each main character could become a spin off movie.HR, IT, Management, Accounting, Security, Customer Service, Marketing, Purchasing, Admin Assistances..All movies these characters would dominate in a comedy royal.Hugh Cast..Hugh Fake Company..Hugh Stupid Ideas they come up with..Hugh success as this movie inspires all Christmas non-denominational mixer parties to kick butt! And now an office cult classic!This movie is for the working class.. Not welfare internet bloggers who have time to post blind opinions on a working life they know nothing of, cause they on their butts at home.If you work the 40hours..This movie is for you!Everyone else..Get a Job!"
" Second half saves the first half
",2017-06-23 00:00:00,6,"There's a reason they say comedy is the hardest genre to get right. If a joke doesn't hit just right, it stands out as a groan moment. Office Christmas Party is a great example of this.The story is fairly simple and is just an excuse for an old school work party, which means alcohol involved. TJ Miller's character needs to save his branch of a company from being closed by his sister, played by Jennifer Aniston. The way they're going to do that is by landing a major client, by showing him the office spirit. From there, things go off the rails.Up until the party starts the jokes are being thrown, but most miss the mark, or land softly. There are a couple good laughs in the first half, but it's truly the second half of the movie that shines. Once the party starts, the alcohol is flowing and the whole thing goes off the rails laughs become far more plentiful.The other thing worth noting is to make note of who the actors are. This is one of those scripts were the actors were given carte blanche to improvise their lines. That means if you find the actors funny you'll love this, if you find them horribly unfunny you'll want to fast forward. Fortunately there are enough characters that there should be somebody you like."

" Bad bad bad
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,3,"The Office Christmas Party was boring asf, it wasn't funny and it felt really empty and shallow. Jennifer Aniston was the only one doing any real acting in this.Jason Bateman's character in it was the least amusing.I can't fathom how this is a comedy movie??! All in all I think I chuckled twice at some bits and that was it. If this is the direction that comedy movies in Hollywood are heading then i'm staying well away. There's nothing in it I haven't seen a million times before somewhere else. It was just thrown together in the hope to make a few bucks by taking advantage of the Christmas box-office and it's easily forgettable and not something that would make you want to come back wanting more. The trailer makes it look better than it actually is. Boring boring boring."
" Crazy Party
",2017-06-06 00:00:00,7,"This is not supposed to be taken seriously. Quite the opposite it's a comedy. Of course it is in the eye of the Beholder to judge if the comedy works and it is pretty silly. It also is very dirty (I only watched the ""unrated"" version, so I can't tell you the differences between the two versions) and does not hold back any punches.It does not care and there is a lot of swearing, some nudity, a lot of crazy stunts and some interesting cast choices. Making Jennifer Aniston doing the straight act and not going for jokes, but being the ""bad"" one could've gone sideways, but I do think it works quite nicely. Just sit back, relax and enjoy the (predictable) mayhem"
" Against all odds, the party's on!
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,5,"The title itself a short and sweet synopsis. What happens in the film is a chaos during partying and with the crazy twist and turns, the story head for the conclusion. There's no any difference comparing it with other Christmas party films you had seen. Just the cast and scenario changed, that's all. While the setback for his company branch, the head of the office decides not to compromise on the Christmas celebration thrown to his employees. At the same time, he has to pursue a big client who could save the office from closedown. So his intention turns to impress him at all the cost.Seasonal films like this should be watched when it comes out, which is during the Christmas/December. Because it will achieve a better result with us since we're set for the mood. I missed it then, but watched off the season and even though, I quite enjoyed it. Yeah, this film is not any good, yet nothing stopped me from having some fun. The comedies are clichÃ©, but the actors were good. Fast paced narration, over hundred minutes long. Shot most of the film in a building, there's a little outdoor adventure. Overall, worth a watch, even though a below average film.5/10"

The acting which was one of the good reason that the movie is good, Jenifer Aniston was stunning as always, T. J. Miller was good partner with Jason Bateman, also we have Kate McKinnon who made us laugh with her silly lines, Courtney B. Vance did rock also in the film. The directing was good making the shooting in the party. The music and party combination was great."
" Conflicting loyalties spoiling the fun
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,4,"I laughed fairly hard at several occasions. But ultimately the movie felt insecure about how comfortable its own audience would be realizing it is making rude fun of them. The movie is targeted at people who have these sad office Christmas parties so while it portrayed the entire personnel as hapless losers to get the laughs, it kept repeatedly contradicting that by claiming that they are not, killing the same jokes but getting nothing in return for its lame attempts to be politically correct right after not being so. It did not much improve the experience that the scriptwriters didn't seem to have any idea about office work nor how technology companies operate.Eventually Office Christmas Party succumbs on the same saccharine swamp where these overcast ensemble movies tend to crawl to spend their final moments, with each recognizable face doing the duty that is expected of them, no more, no less."
" Hilarious!!!!!!!!!!! What are wrong with you people
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,9,I would hate to party with some of the people that wrote reviews out here. Yeah it's rude and crude but try and find a comedy these days that isn't. It does have a slow start but even then I found myself laughing more then I have been lately at some of the lame comedies they put out. I have figured out if it has a low rating then it will probably be very good. I think most of you people that review these movies now think you are Richard Roeper or some other anal critic. Lighten up and enjoy a movie for once. Jason Bateman and Jennifer Anniston are great together as usual. Supporting cast are great especially Mary the HR lady. Once the party starts you will be cracking up. I watched it twice the night I got it just to go back and make sure I didn't miss anything and crack up again.
" Misleading Title
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,1,"The name ""Office Christmas Party"" does not do any justice with the movie. At ALL. It is about office tussle between siblings, their past jealousy, thrown in the mix is a recent divorcÃ©e who has hots for a co- worker. Then there are mandatory an Asian, an Indian and a couple of black people who are again irrelevant to the title. I usually don't write reviews. When I saw the advertisement of this movie on a bus, I was super excited. I have had my fair share of office Christmas parties so I thought ""oh goody, someone finally thought of this. This will be crazy funny."" With Jason Bateman, Jennifer Aniston, T.J. Miller, Rob Corddry, Karan Soni, Fortune Femister, Jillian Bell, Kate Mckinnon and Matt Walsh, I thought this is already a super hit. Something in the same class as Old School. ButÂ…but I was so wrong. The film doesn't deal with what is actually happening at the party which it should since there is always so much material to go on but instead it shows a mean person and a good person, sighÂ… the oldÂ… evil and good never ending clichÃ© after clichÃ© goes on and on. I watched all of it and quite frankly it is just a groan out loud movie. Try again people and try to stick to the themed title of the movie instead of opening up so many fronts where you are not able to close them back."

It's not a work of art, nor does it deserve an Oscar, but it has super funny actors and sure to get some good laughs from you. Also, it does not have a very long duration as well, which makes it a fast and fun pastime."

And the final third star is for Vanessa Bayer's sexy look (often adopted by Amy Adams, but with a different dentist)."

Carol (Aniston) the CEO of the company he works for has given him and his boss/her brother Clay (Miller) an ultimatum. They must either close the deal on a $14 million account or lay off 40% of the staff. Seeing no other option they decide to invite the person they are trying to convince to a Christmas party, what starts off as a simple office party soon gets out of control. This was a movie that I was looking forward to. The cast is great and everyone of them are hilarious on their own. T.J. Miller, Jason Bateman, Kate McKinnon...how can things go wrong. The answer is...this movie. The best way to describe this is nu comparing it to the new Ghostbusters. The dialog and interaction between the characters is great and funny, but the actual story and plot is so uninspired that it quickly lost me and I became bored with the entire thing. The funniest part of this movie is Bateman and Miller shopping in the beginning because of the way they interacted. The rest, is just...not good. Overall, extremely disappointing and like Ghostbusters the cast seemed set up for failure even though they did all they could. I give this a C."

" Raunchy
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,2,"The owner of an I.T. company died, and that resulted in the daughter of the owner, Carol (Jennifer Aniston), as acting CEO and the son Clay (T.J. Miller) was given a New York branch. Sibling rivalry has Carol and Clay at odds. Carol sees the last quarter reports and wants to fire everyone, and no one get bonuses, and, of course, no Christmas party. She says that if someone can come up with an idea to bring in more money all will remain the same. No one can. Josh (Jason Bateman) is one of the company officers. Clay and Josh figure that if they can hire Walter Davis (Courtney B. Vance) who can bring in millions, all will be saved. A Christmas party is born in spite of Carol and Walter Davis is to be invited to get him to join the company. I only took this out because I saw Jason Bateman's name. He is the only one in Hollywood who has the timing for whatever job he is hired for. Regardless of the movie he is in, watch him closely. The movie may be pure crap (as this one is), but he will shine. He knows timing. I would recommend that he set up a school to teach so-called-comedians of today how to do timing so they don't embarrass themselves as they do now. Okay, that said the first half of this movie is okay, some language, but nothing to point to shutting it down. However, when the party starts and seems to never end you will hear language to be sure, but you will see very crude and vulgar visuals with people, some naked, too. We know that Hollywood has sunk to lows they can never recover from and this movie proves that once again. In a word Hollywood knows nothing about how to do comedy as they are more interested in Shock Value because they think that is funny. Did I laugh at anything? Absolutely not. There was nothing funny or even clever. The title should have been Office Christmas Party from Hell.I will say that Bateman disappointed me (Bad Jason) doing a scene simulating a BJ on an ice sculpture that looks like Santa. Yes, the crowd put him up to it, but hey, it was in the script. The script needed a rewrite as soon as the party started. The rest of the time, he as Josh, was okay. Again, watch him. He knows timing. Jennifer Aniston as Carol was okay as a out-of-control CEO, but when she says FU to a little girl at an airport, I couldn't believe I heard that directed to a little girl. Her parents must be so proud she was in a movie, right?There is a twist later on, but who cares? A vehicle crash shuts down the internet for the entire city and some employees figure out a way to get it back and does this save the movie? Goodness no. And again, who cares?Notables who did nothing to help this along: Olivia Munn as Tracey; and Kate McKinnon as Mary.There really isn't anything left to say. (2/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes. Nudity: Yes. Language: Yes."

I sat through the whole movie because I'm an optimist, and bought it at the store because I'm apparently a chump when I enter Best Buy.On the plus side: There was a mini love story - I'm being kind here. A cool tech invention - that made no sense - at freeking all. A party - 'cause hey, it's in the title. Beautiful women - Olivia Munn could make flames sweat, Kate McKinnon could make flames nervous and Jennifer Anistons character could make flames run. Some jokes - sort of - I think I'm being kind again. The reveal on how the party was paid for was kind of heart warming ... ish.On the minus side - the majority of the movie. Plot was ehhh, script/directing forgot to allow punch lines, actors seemed held back. Jason Bateman played his usual character, Aniston reprises her Horrible Bosses character (minus the sex), Munn tried a kind of comedy that isn't in her yet, and McKinnon's character was miscast. 2 stars because the movie could have been worse, but only if they'd actually cast Sandler or JarJar Binks."
" Better than I was expecting
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,6,"I dreaded seeing this. My daughter rents many videos on Redbox, but we consistently shot her down when she would bring this one up to rent. She finally rented it anyway. We sat down to watch it and I was ready to just play games on my phone until it was over. I was pleasantly surprised. It was not as bad as the reviews would lead you to believe. Comedy is a very relative, personal thing. What someone finds funny, someone else would not. I have strange taste in comedy. I like physical, silly comedies, but also intelligent satire, I'm kind of all over the map when it comes to what makes me laugh. This one, about a software company on the brink of failure, was pretty good. I laughed several times. It was a little long for a comedy, I feel they could have edited some scenes better. Two hours is too long for most movies, especially a comedy. I liked most of the characters and thought they did well with the script they were given. It's not rocket science, but it was entertaining and I'm glad she rented it."

",2017-04-02 00:00:00,4,"Office Christmas PartyThe key to surviving any office holiday party is bringing your lawyer as your plus one.Unfortunately, none of the employees in this comedy prepared for sexual harassment.Intent on throwing his employees (Rob Corddry, Kate McKinnon) the best office Christmas party in hopes of impressing a client (Courtney B. Vance) and keeping his branch afloat, party- animal manager Clay (T. J. Miller) drains his bank account and pulls out all of the stops.Meanwhile, his sister - the acting CEO (Jennifer Aniston) - is headhunting his best people (Josh Parker, Olivia Munn) for her New York office.Despite its comedic ensemble cast, this lump of coal suffers a dearth of laughs, direction and believability. Relying heavily on party montages and zany characters to propel its patchwork script this seasonal gift is best returned in the New Year.Besides, mixing work and alcohol is only wise on your last day there.

",2017-04-02 00:00:00,7,"I just finished watching Office Christmas Party without reading the reviews first. And now that I just read a couple pages of reviews I realize once again that there are a whole lot of humorless people walking on this planet. Not that it is the greatest comedy ever, far from that, but there are for sure enough sequences to make you have a good time. I just wonder what does make those negative reviewers laugh. Probably nothing. There are a lot of people that just never laugh, never have any fun in their pretty boring lives. I'm so lucky my wife has the same sense of humor as me, so that we have fun every day of the year. The story in the movie is not to be taken serious because it's just a comedy. Maybe with some stupid humor but it's still way better then a lot of other comedies. Kate McKinnon made me laugh the most, but the other comedians all added their bit as well to make it an enjoyable comedy to watch. Just don't expect too much of the story because it's not the point to have a great story, it's just about the fun."
" Such an awesome movie. SUCH. AN AWESOME. MOVIE.
",2017-03-31 00:00:00,10,"I was honestly gobsmacked to find this movie scored lower than a 7. This was the best movie of 2016... For me. I generally do not like comedies, so I am surprised to see many reviews deprecating the humour while I was cackling from start to finish. I guess this movie found my niche.I watched Christmas Office Party on the coldest day of March in a century, and this wonderful movie has warmed my heart.Wow. Every scene. Every character. Wow. Is this movie still in the running for an Oscar? Idgaf give them all Oscars. Wait a minute is that- oh my God. By golly. Yes, folks. That IS Olivia Munn. The cherry on top of a movie-of-the-decade sundae. Charming/enamoring and funny, and every ""shock face"" reaction honed to perfection. I really hope we see more of her after this! Jillian Belle take me now (what a lovely and unexpected surprise!). Kate Mckinnon. 'nuff said.Better, wilder party scenes than project X. The creators of that should have watched this before they tried to define the modern out-of-control party archetype. And yet, there is so much more going on here than just another ""let's get funked up.""Beautiful sets. I'll often look up the budget of a movie when I'm done watching and scoff. But here I can really see where the money went.Original. Outrageous yet tasteful humour with old tropes taken to a new level. Least predictable movie I've seen in a long time, and certainly one of the most immersive comedies I've ever seen. I usually find myself rolling my eyes as soon as the resolution starts rearing its ugly, watered down, cookie cutter head. But this had me on the edge of my seat and genuinely rooting for the protagonists.Movie of the century."

",2017-03-25 00:00:00,6,"this film was very mediocre.

When all was said and done, it felt like a lot happened, but just like the past few films I've been watching recently, its more slow paced SITCOM -like dialogue that blows up into again a very mediocre film. Stars that end up being in this film too do not compliment the film too too much, but if Jason bateman wasn't in the film, I'm sure that again...the film would have had a lot less appeal.I guess im surprised that there are less than 100 reviews overall regarding this. Well Im off to compliment the sasquatch gang movie now."
" Supporting Cast Makes The Film!
",2017-03-23 00:00:00,7,"This movie is exactly what the title claims - it's a raunchy slapstick about an office Christmas party. The plot is so basic that the majority of the film is filler improv from the long & strong list of comedic supporting actors cast in the film. In this reviewer's opinion, this is what makes the movie stand out. While top billed cast (Jason Bateman, Jennifer Aniston, Olivia Munn, Courtney B. Vance) work within the limits & confines of the main story arc, supporting cast members including T.J. Miller, Jillian Bell, Rob Corddry, Vanessa Bayer, Randall Park, Kate McKinnon (who continues to do no wrong when given the opportunity to commit to a character), and even small bit players like Matt Walsh, Ben Falcone, Erick Chavarria, Adrian Martinez, and Fortune Feimster all given the liberty to veer from the script, shine in their respective roles. If you know them, then you know their brand of comedy - which does not disappoint in this film!"

Stars, its got Jennifer Anniston in it.But somehow the bosses decided they would make a holiday film that is totally soulless. They had a script that constituted jokes for swearing. And as for the characters, they went through the mediocre motions like grandma after the holiday turkey.The problem goes back to the script. Getting comedians who can do a bit of improv and hoping it will make comedy gold will not work. The old 'they might lose their jobs' becomes pointless, as you end up hoping they do. Adults acting like six year olds is funny for about five minutes.In the end I came to the conclusion the scriptwriter was Jewish, and the only laugh they were having was on us."
" A Truly One-Star Film
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,1,"Let me start by saying, this is the first one star review I have provided on this site. But here we have a truly deserving first recipient in what is a cynical, tedious, lazy cash-grab (yes, apparently it made money...) of a film which has absolutely nothing to say.And some (including I) might say that films do not always need necessarily to have a deeper underlying meaning, message or theme; sometimes a completely brainless, crude and/or silly movie is needed after all. But here we see the culmination of years' worth of horrific ensemble pieces targeted around key marketing periods (Valentines Day, New Years Eve etc.) which are widely dismissed as simply the dross that they are, becoming the norm. Worse so however, now we are at the apex of awfulness due to our indifference towards such self-egrandising back-slappery from increasingly C-list (an irrelevant but funny aside is that autocorrect somewhat aptly converts ""C-List"" to ""Colostomy"") actors and actresses who very visibly flaunt the fact that they are there simply for the money. In this film it is practically shovelled down our throats as an audience; with one character visiting several ATMs after seeing a situation get increasingly out of hand (very meta under these circumstances) and another who insists on strapping all of his - substantial - available wealth to his body. The real shame with Office Christmas Party though is just how detrimental it is to the reputation's of some incredibly talented actors who are inexplicably embarrassed here: Courtney B. Vance, Kate McKinnon and Jason Bateman being the real glaring aberrations, who we can only hope now return to projects which provide more spiritual and artistic nourishment. My only reservation with a one star review here was that it may incite ""hate watching"" (where a film is so bad you just have to see it) but unfortunately this is such a poor, tepid affair that even that would be a massive disappointment."
" very good, crazy but too restraint
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,7,"Could have been really crazy, but i guess that for most people this is crazy enough. it's not an eight, but its more than 7 :)) the idea is obvious, the whole film is quite predictable, what makes it so much fun are the people in it, the actors and whoever appears in it. There are no excuses here for the nonsense, no one pretends it's a Fellini movie, it's a fun gig, good time descent jokes thingy. the people responsible for this film could have gone further, make this movie really top the nut charts, but they restrained themselves, for their own reasons, and yet, some parts were completely mad. So, if you want to have some good fun, watch it!"
" Thus is supposed to be a comedy...
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,8,"... and it is.Some of the reviewers appear to belief this is a Helen Keller story; or the story of a pre-Christmas mass at your local church.NO, it is not any of those.It is a adult comedy, and it fulfills that role beautifully.Want an adult-oriented comedy? Watch this movie - it's worth your time.Not your thing? Avoid this movie - it's a d*** good, sacrilegious, comedy. COMEDY."
" You Might Not Hate It.
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,6,"""Hey, Santa! Wanna party?""I saw this film with my dad in the theaters, but luckily we went the same night that Rogue One opened. Needless to say that this film was pretty empty. I do like seeing R Rated films in the theaters because you're less likely to sit in front of a bunch of stupid teenagers that are there to hang out and not to actually watch the movie.The story has a good setup. A brother and sister take over their father's company after he passes away. The sister, Carol (played by Jennifer Aniston), is a cold hearted b-tch that wants to shut down her brother's branch of the company. Clay (her brother, played by T.J. Miller) suggests that she gives him the chance to make one last deal with a big investor. She grants him this, but if they don't close the deal, all of his employees will lose their jobs. So Clay, his best friend Josh (played by Jason Bateman), and co worker Tracey (played by Olivia Munn) throw a HUGE Christmas party to impress the investor. Soon the night turns into one big mess.Let's talk about the characters. Clay and Josh are the people we spend the most time with in this film. Josh is down to earth and the most likable for me. Clay, on the other hand, is pretty much a big idiot. He means well throughout the whole film, but is almost too stupid to get to where he needs to be. I do like the character Tracey, and she does play a big roll in the film's ending. Carol is a total b-tch throughout almost the whole film, but I'm not faulting her for that. She's suppose to be the bad guy.I feel like the film was well written. Most of the jokes came off the way that they were suppose to, and I laughed a lot during this film. Sometimes in these comedies, they take the jokes one step too far, making them feel forced and awkward. I didn't feel this way while watching.The performances in the film were well done, as you would expect them to be. Jennifer Aniston and Jason Bateman just have excellent chemistry together. I loved every single scene that they had together. The only thing that I had seen Olivia Munn in before was XMen Apocalypse, so it was nice to see her in a comedic role. I really enjoyed her. As for T.J. Miller, I do enjoy him as a comedy actor. I think he's funny and I love how straight forward his jokes are. I had only really seen him in Deadpool before this, so I hope to see more of him in the future.Overall, if raunchy comedies are your thing, I'd definitely say this is worth your watch. I did enjoy this film a lot and it will be making it's way into my collection when the bluray is released. Is it worth a trip to the theater? I'd say maybe not. Not unless ""comedies"" are your favorite. It's definitely worth renting out of red box though. As always, thanks for reading this review and I hope you enjoyed it!"
" just another ""party hard"" movie
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,5,"There's been a sub-genre of comedies in the past maybe 10 years, probably called ""party hard"" :-) Now this movie is just a typical representative of that sub-genre, nothing more, nothing less. The title however suggests something more in the style of 90s Christmas movies, while this is nothing like that. The parents would have made a mistake if they brought their children to the cinema."
" Great Movie Adults Only
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,9,"This is a great movie to watch on guys night or gals night, but definitely not suitable for families. If you like Harold and Kumar movies you would like this one too, if not skip it.Warning movie contains adult/sexual themed scenes including images of partial/full nudity of both males and females.So if you're offended by this type of content be forewarned.Generally speaking the movie is very entertaining, and doesn't take itself seriously, its a good movie to watch to on a Friday night after a long week in the office, but only to the people who are in to this movie genre. Personally I am into this kind of genre and I loved it. I hope my review is helpful."
" Office Christmas Part (2016)
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,6,"This isn't Christmas season but this film kind of transcends the holiday time and can be viewed as a raunchy party comedy. While this isn't a perfect film and it doesn't tread new ground from other previous similar films, I think great casting and a carefree comedy make the film worth watching. Its nice to see Jason Bateman and Jennifer Aniston basically playing similar characters as they did in Horrible Bosses.The film is about a branch of a company that is in trouble and really needs a cutting edge idea to keep it afloat. The CEO (played by Aniston) wants to lay off a bunch of the staff and her brother (TJ Miller) and his staff want to impress a potential business partner that could really help out the company. And all this takes place during a wild and crazy Christmas party. The film doesn't always offer laughs and sometimes gets to bogged down in the plot aspect of the film and the company that it doesn't really let loose and just have fun. The film's a bit clichÃ©d and tried but it doesn't take away from making for an entertaining watch.Aniston plays a meany bitchy boss very well. She's done it before in Horrible Bosses and honestly its something I love to see her do. Unconventional role for her but she excels in it. TJ Miller always plays the carefree lovable idiot in all his work so its no different here but he is on point. Bateman is his usual straight man who falls into terrible scenarios/awkward situations. Courtney B. Vance was an interesting addition (coming off a high from The People vs OJ). Kate McKinnon is a lovable oddball and her and Vanessa Bayer bring a nice touch of SNL to it. Lat but not least Abby Lee is a certified 100/10, good lord she is gorgeous.Its not a conventional Christmas film and probably isn't one you'll be running back to every year. The film isn't very memorable and falls into the category of watching it one and done. Its a fun time pass though and the actors and their compatibility make it worth a watch. If you like this type of party film with middle aged prototypical characters, then this film is going to do it for you.6/10"
" Bateman & Munn give a clinic in ""grounding""
",2017-03-10 00:00:00,7,"If you study film, you know that entire texts have been written on the importance of ""grounding"" in a script.The ground, also known as the glue, is the character that the viewer finds most relatable, most sympatico, when the story itself starts fray around the edges. Which is not to say that all scripts require a strong ground or glue, merely that the more outrageous scripts, the scripts with the least internal cohesion, require as much ground as they can get.Which brings us to OFFICE XMAS PARTY, one of the more blatant examples of a ""spaghetti on the wall"" script. In other words, not a lot of fine tuning was done to get this baby ready for shooting day. The writers just took every gag they could think of, threw it against the wall, and then waited to see what stuck.Some of it stuck, most did not.But Bateman and Munn hold the film together by holding the attention of the viewer. In fact, they are so effortless at it that, every now and then, for just a split second, you almost think they are acting in another movie entirely, a romcom in which they are the only characters, and you are imagining the other 400 extras in this overdone extravaganza.Is it funny? Not really. This reviewer laughed exactly once.Is it engaging? Well, because of Bateman and Munn, actually it is."
" Credit Outtakes were the only time I laughed
",2017-03-10 00:00:00,1,"How can anyone take this cast and make a movie that does not have one, single laugh out loud moment? Never mind laugh out loud, I did not even chuckle once until the outtakes during the credits. There is not one surprise. Not one clever gag you didn't see coming from the start. Literally a complete and utter waste of time. Terribly written and mailed in acting."
" Not a complete waste of time
",2017-03-10 00:00:00,4,"Given the line-up for the film I was expecting a little more, it certainly showed potential. There were still a few laughs but overall it largely fell flat. The saving grace was probably T.J. Miller who, with his charismatic charm, provided a few good laughs. All in all, not great but not entirely terrible either."
" Riddled with actors trying too hard to be funny!
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,2,"The summary title speaks for itself. Don't watch this.I could almost tell from the advertising surrounding it what it was going to be like. Of course I still went to see it, but that wasn't my choice I swear. True, I went in prejudiced against it but I think that this made little difference in the grand scheme of things. You could spend a few minutes watching videos of cats doing stupid things on YouTube, and laugh tenfold the amount of times you would watching this. Jennifer Anniston is a well-decorated actress that's been in a ton of films, no one can dispute that... but I'm trying to count her outstanding productions and next to none are coming to mind. This is another example of such a flick... The curly haired idiot brother, the overly uptight health and safety officer, the ever-irritating supposedly wise-cracking pimp, the boisterous taxi driver... all of these characters try far too hard to be funny and all fail miserably. Occasionally, a line will be said and you'll briefly smirk at it... if you're lucky.The plot is dull, the acting is weak, the over-acting is strong and the story becomes predictable. You'll see the grand finale coming a mile off... This film reaches new levels of 'not funny', save yourself the effort. I can never understand why despite all the amazing productions we have out there, people still opt for this kind of garbage."
" I'm headed to this party!
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,6,"We've all been to Christmas Parties at the office before, and this time of year, when it's Christmas, we get a plethora of holiday themed films. Well, the end of 2016 gives us 'Office Christmas Party', the vulgar rated R Christmas movie that centers around a giant office Christmas party that's made by the filmmaking duo of Will Speck and Josh Gordon ('Blades of Glory'). Does this offer any insight or something new to the comedy Christmas genre? No, not at all. That being said, this is a highly entertaining and hilarious film that I can see myself watching every year around the holidays. With the all-star cast, good soundtrack, funny dialogue, and an office party that we would all want to attend â€“ 'Office Christmas Party' is a success.The other side of the coin here is that the writers added a side story throughout the film that took focus off of the Christmas party at hand. Jason Bateman plays Josh Parker, the CTO of a tech company run by Clay Vanstone (TJ Miller) and his sister Carol (Jennifer Aniston). Carol has a grudge with everyone and is business all the time. She is mean-spirited and the Scrooge of film. Clay is the fun-loving guy who is an idiot, but loves to treat people right. When Carol comes to town, threatening to shut down Clay's office branch for good and fire the 200+ employees there, Clay and Josh plan an epic office party to impress a client to save their company and everyone's job.The party goes way past epic into legendary status with drugs, booze, sex, fighting, celeb cameos, and even a human centipede reference. These party scenes are quite funny, as it seems like a lot of the actors, including Kate McKinnon, Rob Corddry, Vanessa Bayer, and many others used a lot of improv for their jokes, which always sparked a laugh. There is a side story with tech master Tracey (Olivia Munn) who has invented a new way to connect to the internet. This idea plays throughout the film and just bogs down the film in between the party scenes.Still, there are enough laughs and Christmas spirit that makes this film highly entertaining and enjoyable on multiple viewings, even if there isn't anything new or original here. Aniston is the real star here, as her rudeness and horrible character traits just nail every scene that makes you giddy with laughter. McKinnon is relegated to mostly fart jokes and isn't any fun with the exception of a couple of scenes. And as always, TJ Miller is glorious and Bateman plays it cool with great dry humor. This is one 'Office Christmas Party' I will be attending every year.RECOMMENDED!"
" Nudity. Felt like the trailer didn't warn me.
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,1,I am not going to lie the movie made me laugh some. A lot felt forced. I really DON'T appreciate seeing a penis. I think I should have a say whether I see one or not. Will definitely be more cautious before seeing other movies in the future. Most women don't like dick pics. Personally I don't like seeing them on-screen. Poor taste and immature.I think trying to make sexual harassment in the workplace a joke isn't a laughing matter it can trigger people who experienced it. Even though it was supposed to be different I feel like I have seen different versions of this movie because a lot seems like recycled story lines. Olivia Munn was not believable. I wanted to like her and her character but she fell flat. A lot of the characters did not seem very developed and one dimensional.
" Embarrassing.
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,1,"A rolling embarrassment from top to bottom. Actors, crew, scriptwriter/s, directors/s, producers, distributors, theaters and viewers. Whoever thought this 'idea' was worthy of spending money on should be drafted into the Army to make STD protection documentaries. The dialog was a combination of 'we're hip' and 'we're cute' and finally 'we're immature and silly and you must laugh at our foolish antics'. Not to mention 'we've got cool jobs, act like jerks at work and nobody with a brain ever calls us on it'. The acting was straight out of Pac Bell. They read their lines in the trailer and then spoke them when the camera was running. What could go wrong? A lot."
" The worst movie EVER
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,1,"The movie that would not end ... a cast that clearly had personal conflicts as they did not gel well together at all, a shockingly bad script, terrible ad lib, and in a theater watching with me of 30 other people not a single laugh through the entire movie.Poor acting, terrible story line.How do these movies get budget, stick JA (who's laughing all the way to the bank on this one) on the budget proposal and they throw money at a concept and a script that should be thrown in the bin.Not a single ray of light throughout the entire movie, you'd be upset if this was given to you as a free download, what a waste of bandwidth.Don't get me wrong there's always a place for a gentle fun and outlandish movie, The Hangover pulled it off but this just made you wish for a hangover, a darkened room and silence.Terrible."
" Wickedly Funny Holiday Flick!
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,7,"I made it to the local multi-plex to see this over the holidays. TJ Miller (and Jason Bateman, playing his classic straight man role) must save his company branch before his evil CEO sister (Jen Aniston) closes it, and his plan is to have the most awesome-est office Xmas party ever! Well, only the deepest regions of h**l could've conceived THIS Christmas party! LOL A great cast, with all the right actors in the right roles really make this movie a lot of fun. I do want to do a special mention for Courtney B. Vance, who has played all these really serious brooding, important roles over the years, and here we get to see him do and say some things you've probably never seen him do/say before. He stole the movie for me, and I was LMFAO every time he was on screen!"
