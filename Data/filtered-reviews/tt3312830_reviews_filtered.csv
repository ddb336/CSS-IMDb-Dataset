" 2 for the movie and 10 for the conclusion
",2021-04-03 00:00:00,2,"The director's nods to Fellini continue to enthral the critics, who fall over backwards perhaps even more than for Tarantino, because the former is European. Not bagels here, but brioches and baguettes. The reason why Oregon has nothing on the Swiss Alps, is because today's Americans are invaders, not natives. However, Switzerland dear reader is as robotic as Stepford Wives country, and outdone only by the Vatican as a state as sinister as the deep web. The two sides of the Pond are represented by Kietel (hamming it somewhat) and Caine (magnificent, lordly even). But the armoury of star names cannot salvage a lousy script and stilted dialogues. Humour is in short supply, and the director's poetics are always suspect. As usual, Sorrentino is effortful, in earnest to make a point or two, to be pithy and in this case draw parallels about the woes of life and our transience in the world. But the result is eerily vacuous (frankly, that sacred cow Fellini was also often vacuous). The film essays to be a comedy, a parade of sophisticated wit. If you survive this parade of ur-privileged white people, good luck. The director has access to exclusive retreats wherever he goes, so he has a nose for its surreal treats: the married couple who never speak, the climber who gawps at Caine's daughter, the pseudo-burka ladies, etc. The droll topic of incontinence brought a smile (Sorrentino was born in 1970, and therefore on the way), yet the prime joke is Kietel's 600-dollar cardigan with the single button at the bottom. Ho ho. Dedicated to Francesco Rosi (look him up), the best part of the film is the ending, worth waiting for if you have any musical nous. But, as Stravinsky supposedly told Ballinger: Don't be an intellectual. Advice the director Paolo evidently chose to ignore."
" Unique and bold, with likely staying power to boot
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,8,"Not sure I understood it 100%, but I definitely felt it.For every instance when I was slightly irked by not knowing where it was going, or why certain characters were being concentrated on, there'd be several instances where I got impressed or even overwhelmed by the music, visuals, and almost all the performances (especially Caine, Keitel, and Weisz, who are all fantastic).This one will stick in my mind and haunt me until an eventual rewatch, I reckon.
Seems like that kind of movie."
" One Of The Most Crafted And Superb Films Of 2015 With a Great Cast And a Good Story About The Younger Youth And Age Of Being Old.
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,4,"With it's Wonderful Cinematography And Even The Striking Images Filmed Around The Outside And it's Beautiful Landscaping Country Of Switzerland, The Cast Was Terrific Even Michael Caine, Harvey Keitel, Rachel Weisz And Paul Dano Deliver Marvelous Performances Even Thou Jane Fonda Has One Big Scene With Harvey Keitel's Character Was Good Also Even The Extra Surporting Characters in This Movie Were Great Too But The Best Thing About This Movie What i Really Enjoyed The Most Are The Characters in This Film Are Brilliant Epespecially Between The Moments That They Share including Scenes involve Michael Caine, Paul Dano, Rachel Weisz And Harvey Keitel Are Very interesting And The Chemistry That All Of Four Them Have Are Just Plain Terrific i Even Thought This Film Had Great Humor in it."
" Wow
",2020-11-24 00:00:00,8,"Im speechless, i full on cried at the end.
Ever so often there comes a movie that makes you think about life.."
" Simple songs
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,7,"Two masters in their fields (music and cinema), one retired and the other working on his final project, recharge their batteries and energies in the mountainous lands of Switzerland. It's not an easy film to follow, due to the way the narrative is structured, but it's not bad for that, on the contrary. It is one of those films where you don't see much, but you hear a lot, and that is the way that the message is transmited. It's an insight into life, the golden years and the time wasted in futility, about true relationships without proper recognition, and the superfluous ones that accompany us to death. In terms of photography, it's a feast for the eyes, with magnificent nature plans, as well as the hotel's "" living props"". The soundtrack is jaw-dropping. Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel are an iconic duo here."
" Magnificent
",2020-09-22 00:00:00,10,"A wonderful spector for the eyes, great cinematics, and a delightful ending. In reading a few of the reviews below I thought it would be prudent to remind everyone that before choosing a movie to watch, ask yourself what mood you are in, and what kind of mood do you want the movie to provoke."
" Emotional experience.
",2020-08-26 00:00:00,8,"I don't want to say very much about Youth as it's an emotional experience that you just have to feel for yourself.Youth explores a lot of things. Love, friendship, family, music, cinema, sex but most of all, growing old. This film follows Fred Ballinger a former composer and conductor and Mick Boyle a filmmaker they are childhood friends on holiday in Switzerland. Both are reaching the end of their lives and deal with things like their inevitable death and regret in very realistic ways.The acting is really great, Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel are fantastic and perfectly cast, Michael Caine was 82 years old and Harvey Kaitel was 76 at the time of filming. Rachel Weisz and Paul Dano are fantastic as well. They all have at least one really emotional monologue and during those scenes their performances really shine.There are a lot of funny moments as well. There is a running joke about how Fred and Mick haven't pissed in days, this is one example of the really well done comic relief.I don't have many complaints technically either. Everything is very well thought out and presented beautifully.All of these aspects are great, but to me the best part about Youth is the characterisation. Every character feels like they have had a life, personally I think Michael Caine's character Fred is the best. This is very important for a film like this one.I'm on a bit of a streak with great movies at the moment. Youth is another film I would highly recommend you check out."
" The song at the end was good but zzzzz......
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,4,"Boy, is this as snorer. Gorgeous Swiss Alps scenery and the always watchable Michael Caine doesn't save it from extreme pretentiousness and boredom. I finally fast-forward to the climax, a love song to his wife now inert with Alzheimer's, which did live up to its hype. I can't recommend spending the time to watch this one, though."
" Just boring.
",2020-06-23 00:00:00,2,"The film is supposed to be a presentation of life, but it's just boring. Not much happens during the film, there are some drama elements, but they barely help the movie."
" Simply beautiful ...
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,9,"This is a movie for older people; if you're still trying to find out who you are, then don't watch it.This movie doesn't have clever dialogue, fantastic cinematography, or anything that makes a movie great! What it does have is that it just resonates. That's it, really. And some great acting and some not so bad music and spectacular scenery."
" Beautiful
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,8,"What a Beautiful Film, i Think it's too late to say This one it's a must See, Don't Mind The Negative Reviews."
" Out of breath
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,10,"Barely 5 minutes out of the movie and I am still catching my breath. What started off as a almost comical movie turned into a deeply layered masterpiece. The unexpected, the unnecessary, the necessary... I wish I could express what the scenes do to you as a viewer but you must experience this yourself. Preferably sitting on a not too comfortable couch or chair. This is not a luxurious movie spoiling you, although the scenery of the movie tells otherwise. It takes work, it takes work for you to understand the characters. But please, undergo this work. Feel what they are feeling. See what they are seeing and you will experience, what they are experiencing. I have laughed, cried, judged, held my breath and experienced this movie as ad adventure. Thank you, Paolo Sorrentino."
" Brilliant!
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,10,"That film makes a lot of emotions for me. Youth - but not for young people.
Briefly what I (41) feel after this film: we all wanted to be someone, rich, famous or just useful. And even if its happend, we all going to over the top. And then we just would like to be young again. It doesn't matter you are rich or famous the end is coming. My 91 years old grandma told me that long life is not a gift, but actually a ballast.
The movie is brilliant. Who can undestand that gives 10, others 1."
" Yawn
",2019-10-01 00:00:00,2,"Not one of Sorrentino's best - he does like his 'one central character focused, pensive, slow flowing sentimental' pieces but this one fails where others don't, mainly because he's gone down the Woody Allen route of trying to pack in as many big names and random celebs as he can at the expense of a real script.Paloma Faith's appearance is nonsensical, Keitel's character sounds like his teeth are falling out, Weisz's hysterical daughter act does nothing for the film, and I don't buy anyone's relationship with each other...it all seems so contrived while trying to be clever and deep, but without any real content.Michael Caine is the saving grace, his performance is superb as always but overall the script and his co-stars let him down."
" Far more than dirty old men looking at naked young women (as the poster seems to imply)
",2019-07-31 00:00:00,8,"""Youth"" (2015) is the second film of Paolo Sorrentino about old age and decay, after ""La grande bellezza"" (2013). Both films make use of Fellini-esk extravaganza.""Youth"" is an ironic title because the film is about a luxurious spa with a predominantly old clientele. Among the visitors are Mick Boyle, director of films (Harvey Keitel) and Fred Ballinger, composer of classical music (Michael Caine). Both men have different apporaches to the diminishing of their strenght and capabilities. Fred has fallen into apathy and abandons all activities. Mick is in full denial and swears that the best is yet to come. Michael Caine and Harvey Kietel both make the best out of their roles, contributing a lot to the quality of the film.Around this central duo various secondary characters are circling. In this respect the film has a resemblance with ""Magnolia"" (1999, Paul Thomas Anderson), although there the central character was a man on his deathbed, a stage that Fred and Mick have not reached yet.The link between old age and decay and the character of Maradona (Roly Serrano) is obvious, but there are other secondary characters for which this link to the central theme is far from obvious. I am thinking about the silent couple and the masseuse with dental braces. The story line for the central couple is wafer-thin and actually a bit banal. The storyline for the masseuse does not exist at all (despite the fact that she reappears a couple of times in the film). This way these characters are reduced to set pieces and in this respect ""Youth"" falls short of ""Magnolia""."
" A not so little gem along the others!
",2019-07-19 00:00:00,10,"My first comment is among these days when films are fast & supposed to be exciting this film is slow with subtle words and actions. It is so rare to witness that. I should recommend watching more films like this one. Not to mention the performance of the actors who give this feeling. I don't about the crew or producers, but the director Paolo Sorrentino had nailed it - all of it!"
" Youth - it's about aging.
",2019-07-09 00:00:00,8,"Youth is a beautifully and thoughtfully made film by Paul Sorrentino - about aging. Caine and Keitel are two old men, best friends, staying in a fancy Swiss hotel for the summer.Fred Ballinger (Caine) is a famous conductor/composer, now retired, and Keitel is a film director, Mick Boyle, who is working on his film while at the hotel, putting the script together with the actors who will appear in it. Ballinger's daughter (Weisz) is her father's assistant, and she is staying with him.An emissary for Queen Elizabeth visits Ballinger to ask him to conduct his own composition, Simple Songs, for Prince Philip's birthday. He refuses. That portion is based on a situation with Ricardo Muti, who could not agree with the Queen on repertoire and ultimately refused to conduct a concert.Michael Caine gives a great performance as a man who feels his life is over. He comes off as being much more fragile than we usually see him, even at his age. He has some very funny dialogue. Harvey Keitel is wonderful as a man going forward, feeding off the energy of the young actors with whom he is working. Rachel Weisz as Lena is heartfelt as a woman who has both anger and love for her father. I saw her on stage -
she's so stunning it's ridiculous.The scenery and the music are flawless.I can't say much more about this film - you either get it or you don't. It's about aging, how you choose to deal with it, love, looking back, looking forward, memories, and one other big thing - youth."
" Filmed in 2015?
",2019-06-23 00:00:00,9,"Out of trend, a nice gentle film.
Excellent acting, no thousands of planets destroyed, no toilet cleaners to pretend actors, fine scenario, moving story.
Doesn't belong here!"
" It's art
",2019-06-07 00:00:00,9,This was one of the most artistic movie. Realistic bur surrealistic at the same time. Romantic but melodramatic too. Great performance by Michael Caine. Don't miss it.
" I did not enjoy this movie
",2019-05-29 00:00:00,1,"Another reviewer said either you love it or don't get it. I found it boring, confusing at times and much too long. It says it's a comedy / drama. I saw no comedy at all. It was hard to figure out at times what was imagined and what was real. I did not understand why/how some of the characters were in it either. I first thought the ending was imagined because he was hell bent on not performing for the Queen. It was one of those movies with good reviews that I kept watching, hoping it would get better, but it didn't."
" I'm too old for this
",2019-04-30 00:00:00,3,"There is a lot of naked flesh in Youth and I do not mean the fat actor playing Diego Maradona.The most memorable part of the movie are shots of gorgeous naked women. Rather sad given this film features legends such as Jane Fonda, Micheal Caine and Harvey Keitel along with Paul Dano and Rachel Weisz.Caine plays retired British composer Fred Ballinger staying is a luxury Swiss spa hotel. He reminiscences all day with over the hill film director Mick (Harvey Keitel) who is his best friend.Fred and Mick also have one other thing in common, Fred's daughter Lena (Rachel Weisz) is married to Mick's son and their marriage has fallen apart. Mick's son has found love with pop star Paloma Faith played by Paloma Faith.This is a surreal arthouse movie and it is not about much. Well the film is called Youth so the two old men talk about the old days, bicker, complain and leer at the women in the hotel which includes a Miss Universe.A waste of the acting talent involved in a poorly thought out script. The biggest waste are the female actresses, they really are short changed."
" A real sense of anguish
",2019-03-05 00:00:00,10,"This is not an objective review. I am only expressing feelings I had watching the film and that stayed with me for a while afterwards.
I want to talk about Melanie (Fred's wife). There were so many themes explored throughout the movie. The most captivating for me was the subtle build up throughout the movie to Fred's wife fate. Even in the scene towards the end of the film when we first see her, we know only so little. Fred starts talking to her, we see her from away. And little by little the camera moves and we see the true state of her face, the terror in her eyes, the million screams that she is producing inside of herself. We see her face once again during the last recital of the ""Simple Songs"". Which makes her a symbol, in which all the aches and harsh realities explored so far can be expressed.We know from Lena (Fred's daughter), from a previous scene, the type of life this woman was living, the sacrifices she was doing. Wasting the good years of her life knowing that her children have no one but her, while her husband is completely absent. She experienced unbearable ""anguish"" during her life.But all of that is one thing and being in that final state of hers is completely terrifying. What despair and hopelessness she must be feeling? One automatically assumes that people in such state are not fully conscious or feeling a peaceful sadness. What if she is completely conscious. I keep thinking about Paloma Faith's horrifying screaming scene in the airplane and that a much worse screaming and feeling of terrible anxiety is happening inside Melanie's head. I was completely brought to a state of terror from the thought of what is going inside her mind."
" A gem of a film
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,9,That's all I have to say. Enjoy it. It's quite breathtaking. Subtle work of art.
" The Downside of Being Rich and Famous
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,7,"At a luxurious spa in the Swiss mountains, two long-time septuagenarian friends reflect on their lives, aging, and what comes next. One is a retired British composer/conductor (Michael Caine); the other is an American film director (Harvey Keitel) working on a new film project with a group of young actors. ""Youth"" is directed by Paolo Sorrentino and is an Italian/Swiss/French/British co-production.The themes of sadness and disappointment are reflected not only in those who are in the later stages of life; even successful younger people show regret such as a young film star played by Paul Dano. While the average viewer might feel a sense of envy and curiosity of how the rich and famous live, the various characters who show up remind us that the wealthy can be as dysfunctional and unhappy as the rest of us despite their great resources.Sorrentino's directing is as compassionate, sweet, and melancholy as it was in ""The Great Beauty"". There are many visual moments that are striking and bizarre (sometimes too bizarre) which add much feeling to the film. His use of the Swiss scenery is also breathtaking. (In this way, the film is similar to ""Clouds of Sils Maria"", also about a successful performer needing nourishment while staying near Swiss mountains.)The unusual camera and sound work during a climactic scene at the end created great impact with their uniqueness. The music by David Lang is also ethereal. (Be sure to stay for the closing credits for this reason.)Caine and Keitel do great work as the main characters and the anchors of the film. But it is scenes including others which had the strongest impact.One such scene involves Rachel Weisz as Caine's daughter and his personal manager. In this particular scene, she expresses grave disappointment in her father's past behaviour.The other major scene involves Jane Fonda as a septuagenarian ex-superstar with whom the Keitel character has worked in the past. In this scene, Fonda chews the scenery as a vile ex-diva. The scene was so good, it left me disappointed that her role had not been bigger. It was too brief. It made me yearn for the era when she was frequently given more substantial movie roles.""Youth"" is a sweet film that attempts to explore the deeper themes of life. It doesn't fully succeed with this ambition but it goes just far enough to be a worthwhile movie experience."
" a waste for your time
",2018-08-06 00:00:00,2,"A horrible movie with no story just some old wisdom nonsense
the only thing good from it are gorges scene and luxury hotel location"
" fine art house
",2018-07-04 00:00:00,7,"Retired concert conductor Fred Ballinger (Michael Caine) is vacationing at a peaceful Swiss spa with long-time friend Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel). He is asked to perform for the Queen but he refuses for a personal reason. Mick is a filmmaker working on his next script with his troop of young contributors. Fred's daughter and assistant Lena (Rachel Weisz) is married to Mick's son but he has left her for a pop star for the sex. The other hotel clients include actor Jimmy Tree (Paul Dano), an obese Diego Maradona, a bitter silent elderly couple, and a young girl.The surrealism sometimes work but not all the time. I like the Nazi outfit, the soap bubble girl, but the dream of Mick's female characters don't register. The grassy hill swallows them up. They are better off lined up in a row in emptiness. As for the main roles, I'd like for Fred and Mick to spend more time together. I love the time that Fred spends with Lena. Dano is hit and miss. His best is with the little girl. I would have love to be told that it was Maradona right from the start. I'm not a soccer fan and I wouldn't know him even if he's not obese. This is definitely a movie with its own style. Director Paolo Sorrentino has an unique sense of rhythm and isn't for everybody. This is for the stylish art house fans."
" Created an account on IMDB just for this film
",2018-05-06 00:00:00,9,"After 25 years of browsing IMDB and always resisting the urge to create an account, it never seemed necessary. Then I just did that to write a blurb about this film.I get it that this film didn't do much for a lot of people, reading through many of the 1 star reviews I get it that it it's probably a pretentious piece of crap. (paraphrasing the 20 or so 1 star reviews)However, for me it worked. The slow moving scenes, the absurdities, the music and the unhinged plot, it all comes together eventually. I've watched the final scene 3 times since watching the film last night for the first time and each time it's making me wanting to see it again.European cinema; pretentious and boring but great nudity when it matters!"
" only the scenery is worth watching
",2018-04-21 00:00:00,3,"I wonder if either Michael Caine or Harvey Keitel regrets having made this movie? One wonders what they thought of the project when proposed, and what they thought after seeing the result. I don't know about Keitel, but Caine certainly doesn't need the money, so one wonders why he signed on to such a pretentious, artsy-fartsy piece of balderdash. Unless, as I say, the project sounded different when presented. First of all, there is no coherent story line. Oh there' s plenty of family acrimony between father and daughter, and some confict between a pair of lovers splitting up, and a scenery-chewing scene between two elderly, separated show business types reaching the end sof their lives and careers. And of course the reference to homsexuality that is de rigeur nowadays. But they are presented as isolated threads with no unifying theme to draw them together. Then we have the pretentiousness. A plethora of cryptic and obscure scenes with weird stagings oddly shot, reminiscent of Fellini, are scattered throughout the film, like trash over a landscape, and make the viewer wonder just what the hell is going on at that particular moment. It wasn't quite bad enough to make me stop the film in the middle, but that is only because of the gorgeous cinematography of the Swiss landscape. Still, I wish, as they say, that I could have my two hours back."
" Sorrentino believes in cinema
",2018-02-04 00:00:00,5,"At its best, ""Youth"" grabs his ideal of grandiloquence with pure cinema moments. It can get gorgeously evocative, like having an old Maradona thinking about his pre-match warm-ups. ""What are you thinking about?"", he´s asked, and he answers ""the future"". As eloquent as it can be it´s also too vague and two hours can become tedious. Maybe too sentimental as well but nostalgia is the engine after all. There´s nothing wrong in missing past times. Nothing."
" Visually Stunning(TROLL KINGS OPINION)
",2018-01-18 00:00:00,8,"Youth is one of the movies that will visually manipulate you to know the story without even a written lyrics, I love the tableaus in the beginning of the film and how the story and character develop. Also, the story is well derive and will make you see how characters evolve from time to time."
" Simple Song Number 3
",2018-01-17 00:00:00,8,"The film centers around 80 something composer/conductor Fred Ballinger (Michael Caine). He is at an Alps resort spa with his daughter Lena (Rachel Weisz) and long time friend and director Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel). Fred is retired and has refused to conduct for the Queen. Mick is with a group of writers as they are attempting to come up with a script for ""Life's Last Day"" and spend their time attempting to compose final death bed endings for the film. There are a number of minor subplots and players at the resort so you can create whatever theme or metaphor you desire for the film.The film was very artsy and theme driven. It appeared to focus on dreams and desires which are best left to youth, but I am sure one could get the opposite meaning. The film has a lot of good lines that appear that they tie things together, but then fall short.""I have to believe everything to make things up.""
""Human beings know how to be pathetic when they try.""
""Emotions are overrated"" contradicted by ""Emotions is all we have.""
""I know you can't levitate.""Rachel Weisz has a soliloquy where she nails it, but I wasn't sure what she nailed. Paloma Faith plays herself as an oversexed pop star. Madalina Diana Ghenea gets naked, which seems to be an odd sell point for an artsy film, but then again so did Michael Caine, and now I am blind.One thing I can say for certain is this is not a formula film. It is a series of scenes, many of which are isolated with no real connection to the main plot.People come to the spa to find themselves, realize their desires, and maybe make their dreams come true..."
" Hard to believe
",2017-12-28 00:00:00,1,"I've seen a lot of movies in my life, but I can't recall a single one with so many good actors involved in such a great nonsense: a supposedly adult reflection on life and aging, filled with commonplace phrases and silly remarks of all sorts, with signs and hints leading nowhere and at the same time predictability in the most childish way (from the incomprehensible inclusion of senseless scenes with Diego Maradona, one of the most stupidest men on earth, to the moment Michael Caine tells the buddhist monk something like ""You can't fool me, I know you can't levitate"", after which you can bet your life you will get a scene with the monk's levitation...) 
I don't think this awful mess deserves any more words: it's the greatest and saddest waste of money and talented actors I've ever seen."
" Endless contemplation....
",2017-11-26 00:00:00,4,"The story is set at an expensive Swiss health resort and it focuses, in particular, on an aging director, Mick (Harvey Keitel), and an even older ex-composer, Fred (Michael Caine). Fred seems like a man waiting to die and even though the Queen of the United Kingdom wants him to perform for her, he makes lots of excuses. His friend Mick, however, seems very active...trying to make that one great film which will be his finale.The film has hardly any plot apart from two old men contemplating life and their existence. In many ways, if you like one of Ingmar Bergman's more depressing films, you essentially know what ""Youth"" is going to be like...somber, depressing, supposedly insightful and as much fun to watch as your grandmother taking a bath. Overall, a hard film to watch, let alone enjoy. Some obviously like it based on the other reviews, but I found that even though the film was made well and well acted, it was tedious and depressing. Even an incredibly beautiful and sensual nude scene wasn't enough to spark my interest in this story."
" Life's Last Day
",2017-11-11 00:00:00,1,"Gaspingly pretentious portrait of characters at a resort hotel and spa in the Swiss Alps. Michael Caine is a British widower and retired symphony conductor--an annual guest at the spa for some 20 years--who refuses a request from an emissary of the Queen of England to conduct again for Prince Philip's birthday celebration. Caine's grown daughter is temporarily staying with him; she's distraught over her recent breakup with the son of another guest, screenwriter Harvey Keitel, an exercise-friend of Caine's who commiserates with him over their combined years and non-working body parts. Other guests include a rock-climbing instructor, a film actor, assorted child prodigies, a beauty contest winner, et al. Writer-director Paolo Sorrentino has a grandiose visual concept, which he makes clear within the film's first 10 minutes; however, his artistically-composed shots of naked, sagging bodies (usually slumped over in states of depression, inert in the steam rooms or floating aimlessly in the swimming pools) are not especially pointed or amusing. The shots call attention themselves, probably to distract the viewer from the lack of substance in the writing (or interest in the central characters). Caine, pinkish-white like a rabbit, seems to look out at the world with bleary eyes--but is this the character or simply the actor in bad physical shape? Keitel doesn't appear very spry either, but the worst is saved for Jane Fonda (in a bad blonde wig) as a jaded, foulmouthed actress just in from Los Angeles (she asks Keitel expository questions to set the scene: ""How long have we known each other, Mick?""). ""Youth"" flatlines at the one-hour mark--with another 63 minutes on the clock. * from ****"
" A Simple Song
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,10,"must have been the alternative title to this Film (with a capital F).There is a fine line kept throughout the narrative: somewhere between the real and surreal, making the identification with the characters easier than unusual, while allowing for most surreal situations and dialog.Rachel Weisz, Michael Caine, Harvey Keitel and Paul Dano really brought their respective roles to life. The many small roles were enriching as well, especially Jane Fonda's wonderful cameo!But there were two other stars which made this Film a masterpiece in artistic collaboration: the cinematographer Luca Bigazzi, whose every frame is worthy of a wall to hang from and David Lang whose original music brought it all together.Writing, directing, filming, performances and music, in this particular case, make for great Cinema I was touched to tears."
" Emotional Masterpiece
",2017-10-18 00:00:00,10,"I hope everybody has a good friend with whom he talks only of the lighter things in life and not the troublesome, profound stuff. This film is not that friend, but it is about two men subjectively at the end of their life that are this friend for each other. It is about important relationships with one another (family, friends, strangers) and oneself. These relationships form the outline of a life lived despite its inescapable death. Certainly, not every scene touches everyone the same way, but I rarely saw a movie with so much emotional backlash because of little scenes, like the conversation about riding a bike or the metaphor of the looking glass. I will remember them dearly."
" Horrible ""art film""
",2017-09-26 00:00:00,1,"I was so excited to see Youth. Michael Caine had been promoting it all year, claiming it was the movie he was most proud of in his career, and everyone hoped he'd finally nab the Best Actor Oscar. It didn't make it to any of my local movie theaters, but I rented it the first available weekend. Had I sat through it, it would probably be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Thankfully, remotes have a little button called ""fast-forward"" so I was only forced to watch about thirty collective minutes.Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel are on vacation in a spa in the Alps. Michael is a retired composer, and Harvey is a film director. They're old friends, and they talk about their work, their families, and getting older. Michael's daughter, Rachel Weisz, shows up because her husband left her, and an aging actress, Jane Fonda, shows up to talk about a role. That's all I was able to get out of the plot. The disjointed scene transitions, strange music choices, minimalistic script, random nude women, and generally confusing storyline ruined the rest of the film. Unless you love ""art films"" and have the absolute opposite taste in movies as I do, I would tell you to stay as far away from Youth as possible.Kiddy warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to graphic nudity and confusing content, I wouldn't let my kids watch this movie."
" Fails at being Compelling and Tonally All over the Place,
",2017-09-22 00:00:00,3,"Youth is a poor film with a lousy plot and a terrific cast that deserved far better than this script. The cast is the only thing it really has going for itself if I am being honest, Michael Caine shines, as always in the lead role, he has a great back and forth with Harvey Keitel and Rachel Weisz, making their poor dialogue a lot more bearable. It tries so hard to make us feel something. There are a lot of scenes that are meant to be hard hitting, dialogue that is supposed to be brutally honest, but it never gives us a real reason to feel for these characters or care for their heartache. They are all unlikeable and I felt no need to want to see them succeed. As well as that, it is tonally all over the place, it jumps from intense drama to gross out comedy, it can never make up its mind on what it wants to be. The film has both an emotional monologue from Caine in which he talks about his love for his daughter and a scene where two old men watch a naked woman slowly enter a hot tub, it also has singer Paloma Faith playing herself in it. All around, pure ridiculous. Ineffective in every way, Youth was not for me and I could not possibly recommend it. A retired composer and his filmmaking friend reflect on their lives and the prospects of aging. Best Performance: Michael Caine / Worst Performance: Paloma Faith"
" Required viewing for anyone over 65
",2017-07-25 00:00:00,9,Best movie I've seen in last few years. Characters are unique and extremely individualistic. Maintains a good sexual tension throughout the film. Loved the Swiss setting very restful. The whole film is exquisite and tastefully directed..
" Beautiful
",2017-06-08 00:00:00,7,"I'd never heard of this movie, but I was quickly drawn into it, and found it quite beautiful. The storyline is simple, the pace is slow, yet it manages to effortlessly entertain. The cinematography is gorgeous, and the score absolutely perfect...each of the actors/actresses does a wonderful job in their roles. The film does well to portray a varying range of life, and especially the journey of growing old. I'm so glad to have stumbled upon this movie - it is a true gem!"
" A Very Different Film
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,9,"I'm going to keep this simple - I think. I don't know how to describe this film. One reviewer hated it, said it had no structure and indeed it is a bit dis-structured in conventional movie terms. I have no patience for a crappy film, I watched this right through and loved it. It's a movie in scenes, you're always wondering what's going on while little by little it draws you in. I love and appreciate film, characters especially and everyone is superb. The characters are studied and close up. If you're a ""Fast and Furious"" fan you most likely will not like the film. It's an inner film, lush and full, thought provoking. Each character brings quirky insights into life, experience, as you get know them, their life. I haven't told you what the movie is about - read the cover. Warning, it can only give you an idea of where it takes place and with whom. A film on this level can only be watched in order to know. In the end I was left stunned. I'll watch it again.."
" Unique
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,8,"Youth is a film that ironically would have been wasted on me when I was younger. My 20 year old self would have hated this film and probably switched it off after 15 minutes. So I can understand the mixed reviews this film gets. There is little or no action until the last 20 minutes, but for me the best parts were the quiet scenes with no action. There are many scenes where something is hinted at or insinuated. But nothing is ever spelled out for you. I was left thinking a lot about what I had just seen, trying to interpret what it meant or what was about to happen when the scene ended. Youth is beautifully shot, so if you're in the mood for a quiet film with gorgeous visuals and a dreamy soundtrack this is perfect. The plot, or more precisely the premise is about a group of people in a very picturesque holiday resort where everything looks heavenly and relaxing. They talk about life and old age etc. It sounds dull but for me those were the best parts. I only felt it lost its way towards the end, specifically at the moment Jane Fonda showed up. Even though she's very good in this (as is everyone else), her first scene is a long drawn out conversation with Harvey Keitel which shifts the mood of the piece completely. For the first time in the film I found myself bored because the scene dragged me out of the dreamlike mood that had gone before. After that the film trudged on to its finale but never recaptured the spirit of the first 90 minutes. But overall I recommend this film because it was unlike anything else I can recall seeing."
" Sights, sounds and thoughts
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,9,"As a younger man, I probably wouldn't have cared much for this movie, because as a younger man, I wasn't preoccupied with getting older, and the consequences of reaching the September of my life.However, as a musician, photographer, and a baby boomer, I absolutely loved it. I would have given it 10 stars except for a poorly written character trait implied in Michael Cain's ""Fred Ballinger"" to appeal to the gay community for God knows what reason. It doesn't fit into the character's personality or lifestyle at all, and so it made no sense and was purely gratuitous.Aside from that one issue, I found this movie to be a ""masterpiece"", combining sights, sounds and thoughts in a totally original fashion, and takes place in a setting I can't recall ever seeing in any other motion picture.The acting is flawless from all involved, as is the casting, sets, editing, and most of all: 'the music'. I have since purchased the blu-ray of this film, and have watched it more times than I'd care to admit, and I've never been able to control my emotions at the very end with the voice of an angel soprano singing her heart out to a song that not only should have been nominated for an Oscar (it was), but should have won it hands down. 'Simple Song #3'If you're an action addict, this film isn't for you. However, if you like beautiful scenery, music, and talent from all involved, you may like this film as much as I did: One of my top ten favorites."
" All ingredients are there for a good movie but the story is lame.
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,4,"Like someone said before, or you love this movie or you won't think much of it. You can categorize me with the second option, I didn't think much of it and could not wait for this movie to be over. I've just been lured by the names of the cast. Harvey Keitel and Michael Caine are both actors I really like and even in this movie they do a good job with their acting performances. The filming techniques are also excellent, nothing bad to say about that. The nature scenery from Switzerland are also nice to look at. So why would I rate Youth below average? Because when I watch a movie I need to be entertained, the movie has to have an interesting story, a story well told. And even for drama's that are not necessary my thing the story has to be interesting, and sometimes it is. But with Youth I didn't get anything of that. It's a long boring story about basically nothing. Too bad because you had all the right ingredients to make it a good movie. But without a decent story you can't have a good movie."
" Youth
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,4,"The film ""Youth"" (La giovinezza) by the Italian director Paolo Sorrentino is a reflection of the deep crisis in Italian cinema. After the golden age of Italian cinema in the 1960s the crisis started and became inescapable.Director Sorrentino tells the story of two close friends vacationing in a sanatorium in the Swiss Alps. One is a composer played by Michael Caine another is a filmmaker played by Harvey Keitel. Michael Caine plays his role well as usual and is the only reason why the film is remotely watchable.Otherwise the film is dull, pretentious and lacks any new or interesting ideas. The cinematography was bland and unoriginal. The music was surprisingly awful considering this is a film about a famous and beloved composer.The product placement for Microsoft Kinect was shameless, annoying and resembled a parody. The film had a positive critical response, however it is not a masterpiece, just utterly forgettable.The film is just another imitation of Fellini in the same way as ""The Great Beauty"" (La grande bellezza) but ""The Great Beauty"" at least was not so flat out boring and monotonous.It is time for the directors to stop stealing from the great masters and to their find own unique style and to produce new ideas and the film jurors should not encourage plagiarism either.""Youth"" can only be recommended as a sleeping aid.See more reviews at: http://indie-cinema.com/"
" Vacation
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,6,"Vacationing in this Swiss Alps with a film director friend, a retired music composer starts to reevaluate his life when asked by a messenger from the Queen of England to orchestrate one of his iconic works once more in this somewhat ironically titled film. Full of dreamy cutaways to the naked bodies of those staying at the same resort, as well as some near surreal nighttime shots, 'Youth' is a stylish film through and through and bits and pieces of the dialogue are pretty good, with an inspiration versus fermentation exchange standing out most. The story at hand is, however, far from encapsulating with the lethargic pacing eliminating any sense of urgency, and then there is the fact that Harvey Keitel's ageing filmmaker character is actually more interesting that Michael Caine's composer, though Paul Dano surprisingly enough trumps them both with a heartfelt turn as a film actor depressed over the fact that has been stereotyped ever since playing a single role in a film that he considers mediocre at best. He has two of the film's best scenes as he unsettles everyone by dressing as Hitler for breakfast one day and as he encounters a young girl who has actually seen one of his lesser known performances. Caine certainly has his own strong scenes (conducting a chorus of cows) but hardly that high an amount for a protagonist. With strong supporting turns from the likes of Rachel Weisz and Paloma Faith, amusingly playing herself, this is a hard film not to recommend, but it is certainly an example of movie that sounds much better on paper."
" If you like a good story told well you won't find it here
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,1,This movie really was awful.Some one obviously has money to burn and he/she may as well have.The ONLY thing I enjoyed was the scene where miss universe was naked.WOW. For all the pretentious filmmakers efforts to create a visual feast ( and dam the story ) they did not even come close to the natural feminine wonder of this woman.I'm so glad I watched it on DVD so I could fast forward all the really cringe worthy scenes. What a joke. Oh I don't 'get it' I hear you say?This should have been a picture book/coffee table book for adults with little speech bubbles containing the fluff ahem I mean dialogue. Do your intellect a favor and give this a wide berth!I don''t get how a man injecting paint into his ass then propelling it out over the canvas is art either...
" A film of astonishing grace, beauty, elegance, wit, and charm.
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,10,"I do not think it is possible I could have liked this film any more than I did. I was watching it for the second time. The first time I loved it. But, I did not understand what a masterpiece it was. It is absolutely pitch perfect. The direction of the film is stunning. Hollywood should take notice. Few films come out of Hollywood like this lovely gem. This was entirely directed and produced by Italians. It has a magical realist quality to it, and some of the cinematography was positively mind boggling. If you look at some of my other reviews, I am often tearing films apart. Most of the stuff that comes out of Hollywood these days leave me cold and unsatisfied. However, this film was written and shot for adults. I do not think the current crop of kids, that is fueling the boom in nonsensical action films, and comic reboots would get this film at all. Way, way too refined. Too much character development. Not enough action for the kiddies.There are some great scenes of the writers on Kietel's film, where they are brainstorming the script of the film they are writing. It is a wonderful irony, as the script of this film is a thing of beauty. This film centers around the characters of Michael Caine, and Harvey Kietel. Both very successful men. Caine a retired composer, and Kietel a movie director, nearing the end of his career. Wryly observing them closely, and striking up a friendship with Fred, is a movie star played by Paul Dano. The younger man is debating whether to escape his burdensome identification with a robot character in a sci-fi franchise with a drastic change of pace by playing Adolf Hitler in a movie. There is a wonderful scene where Miss Universe shows up and pays her respect to the Dano character. The dialogue is not at all what one would expect. Then Fred gets a visit from his disaffected daughter and personal assistant (Rachel Weisz). She's here to announce that her husband, Mick's feckless son (Ed Stoppard), has just dumped her for real-life rock star Paloma Faith, playing a parody of herself that stars like Mylie Cyrus, Brittany Spears, and many others would never be capable of. As in Sorrentino's 2013 foreign-language Oscar winner ""The Great Beauty,"" the plot is less important than the characters and the opulent settings, which are populated with eccentric, magical characters in the background. This is a movie for adults. And this movie is a masterpiece. A simply stunning bit of filmmaking. Watch it with patience. Watch it with adoration. Watch it with respect. Watch it and yearn for the days when films of this caliber were more common."
