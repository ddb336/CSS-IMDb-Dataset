" Easy to know
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,2,"Rated 2 just because the actor, but the story? Nah. Easy to predict, and already know the end just in 20 minutes. Waste of time. 1 of the worst bruce film just because the writer etc."
" a burning question...
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,4,"Firstly, the echoes of WestWorld devices are loud here...but someone tell me...there is a policewoman technician in an early police station scene where the lead offers up his badge...she is a spitting image of melanie griffith, I swear this must be a brief uncredited role. and an incredible look of youth if she did indeed do this in 2015. anyone?"
" Awesome - WW genre
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,9,"It saddens my heart to think this movie, was so poorly reviewed. A couple of years later. West World is on the scene and the whole world loves it. I really enjoyed this movie. If u are a fan of West World. You will enjoy it, as well."
" I LIKE THOMAS JANE BUT EVEN HE CAN'T SAVE THIS BAD B-MOVIE
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,2,"I checked this out because I'm a fan of the Awesome Thomas Jane & have liked him since 1999's Deep Blue Sea & 2000's The Punisher, Jane is an Awesome actor & action lead but here his hair was annoying lol & he could've save this boring Sci-fi B-movie!!!
Bruce Willis is here as like an extended cameo & seems so uninterested in his role so that's bad & the film feels too cheap & tacky at times & I'm usually a big fan of B-movies & DTV films but they aren't all good & this one was just too slow & quite boring.Nothing fun or exciting happens but there is some good scenes or images scattered amongst the crap but it's not something to enjoy or watch again"
" Bruce, does Passmore have pics?
",2020-08-11 00:00:00,2,"Wow, i spend most Fridays watching horrible movies. This one is now the worse one ive seen since Megasnake"
" Not bad - not great !
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,5,"Story of the film is interesting but the final product isn't.
Death of Evan is bad and it could go without it.
The end is like wtf ?
5/10"
" Boring
",2020-08-06 00:00:00,1,"I casually saw this movie on TV tonight. I thought, ""oh, a Bruce Willis science fiction movie I didn't see? How is that possible?"" After a while, I realized.
With bad acting, plot holes and dumb dialogue, this movie steals from every AI movie I've ever seen, but it makes it worse. I feel lucky I didn't pay to see this masterpiece. After watching Vice, I came to IMDB for the negative comments, and I wasn't disappointed."
" Some ad(Vice) to the writers: do more than one draft
",2020-07-30 00:00:00,4,"Vice was directed by Brian A. Miller, written by Andre Fabrizio and Jeremy Passmore, and stars Thomas Jane, Ambyr Childers, Johnathon Schaech, Bryan Greenberg, and Bruce Willis. It is about an artificial human being escaping from a place where people can play out their wildest fantasies, and is being followed by a cop, and the mercenaries sent by the owner.Plotting is substandard fare, with the whole caught-between-two violent pursuers premise being something everyone has seen. Julian (Willis) has created Vice, a resort where people can play out their fantasies with the involvement of androids. with emotions. When the androids are damaged their memories are wiped and they are repaired. Kelly (Childers), an android, meets Evan (Greenberg) who wants her to follow her dreams. She is killed by a visitor (a cameo from Tyler Jon Olson) and reactivated. Meanwhile, detective Tedeschi (Jane) arrests a man inside Vice. Kelly escapes and Julian sends a cleanup team, including Chris (Schaech), to get her back. Kelly teams up with Evan, and eventually Tedeschi to take down Julian and Vice.Characters are all bland. Tedeschi is the standard detective character who holds no respect for the antagonists, and would rather be fighting Vice itself instead of picking up after it. Kelly is potentially interesting, having been shown her many deaths and reboots; and feels a connection to Evan. Evan is fine, having a decent series of motivations and dealings with Kelly. Chris is the hitman that is in every third sci-fi/action movie, and Julian is the same; just another bad guy that spouts technojargon and wants to keep his company running for profit and other nefarious reasons. Eh. Performances are all weak, with Jane trying in most scenes, but some of the time he just looks tired. Childers is alright, trying her best with a superficial character. The rest of the supporting cast are serviceable. Willis (my favorite actor of all time) is indefensibly bad, looking dead behind the eyes in his scenes which look like they were filmed in a day or two.Action scenes are subpar too. Most of the action consists of guys shooting at each other or at Kelly and missing every single shot. There is no worry for the characters since they are so... nothing. All of the shootouts where both groups involved are firing at each other look the same, with endless shot-reverse-shot photography, and a blue steel look to it all. Little in the way of hand-to-hand combat exists in the movie. What does exist only happens in the last few minutes against a couple generic goons for Julian. So much for upgrades. I can give props to the usage of blood squibs though, the usage of which is a surprise when an action movie is constructed of a meager budget, so at least there's that.Technically the movie lags. Miller's direction gives the impression that he had no intention of showing the audience anything of true substance aside from mediocre action scenes. Ideas are presented like Vice's effects on people who go on to commit violent crimes after their visit, and those against AI becoming desperate to pray to God, and those who embrace it falling into vanity; but the writers get away from these ideas as fast as they can to get to the next action scene. The production slumps into being a bland procedural with a sci-fi appeal that never impresses.Vice is a subpar action/sci-fi venture that held promise which was quickly dropped in favor of a bland procedural and uninspired action bits. Miller, a helmer who has never shown aptitude enough to make something better than decent, really dropped the ball here. Again.44/100"
" What was with all the horizontal fluorescent lights everywhere
",2020-07-12 00:00:00,4,This film could have been so much more but fell flat. Sorry brucie baby I love ya but this film had such good bones and could have expanded it so it was more high octane. The lighting was terrible. Also when she FINALLY -asked for her special skill set it was feeble. Expected her to turn into a killing machine but no.
" This was such a disappointment.
",2020-07-11 00:00:00,2,Bruce Willis and Thomas Jane's performances are surly and flat. I'm always confused when this type of drivel attracts good Hollywood talent. The story and script are shallow and boring. Even the soundtrack is lacking. It sounds like a bad 80's TV movie. It's all quite pointless. Don't waste your time.
" Female robots for entertainment.
",2020-06-29 00:00:00,5,"Bruce Willis played here a Villain's role. He is the head of a highly techno company in future which provides female robots for entertainment they are rebootable every day. One robot model and a cop, both made failed this company. Bruce is okay. Though story plot is based on science fiction movie only seems chasing and gunning everywhere. Lot of parts you can see only escaping , chasing and gunning lots bullets rather than actual science experimental. Movie goes down here otherwise it would have better. Just once time watchable."
" A Poor Attempt to Retell the Same Sci Fi From the Same Tired Moral PoV
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,3,"Movie was bad. Just bad.
IT was less than Westworld in trying to bring the same stuff predicted by sci fi time and time again for decades; namely the emergence of artificial humanoids for our pleasure. BUt for too long people have misunderstood the need for such things one day, believing this to be a moral issue, instead of a critical thought one.
Morality should not be an issue so long as such inventions dont have true emotions, or deep learning logic capability anywhere near what humans are capable of. Not only that, but it will become necessary one day for many men, women and whatever types of things people consider themselves, to have access to these pleasure drones. Its a critical thinking issue, not a moral one. But the movie barely even scratched the surface of trying to cry a rivr about "" oh its so wrong, even though these things are not really human"". The acting was bad, and the talents of Willis and Aaron Eckhart were wasted. I passed out before the ending, but I can assure you, it was garbage. 3/10 just for hte big names involved."
" Excellent concept
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,9,"I don't get all the negative comments, it's a fantastic sci-fi movie and very good acting and the blond Amber Childers is so gorgeous, wish she was is more films. Good directing and excellent SFX considering the small budget. Don't believe the low ratings it's a fun movie that kept me glued to my tv screen. Good watch movie lovers ;)"
" Oh Bruce, Bruce...oh Bruce...wtf....
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,3,"With a budget of only ten million, one wonders how much of that was swallowed up by Willis and his ridiculous fees (leaving very little for the actual film to be made). Someone really should tell him that his days are rapidly approaching. Ok, Roy (Thomas Jane) is a cop who dislikes the 'theme-park' attraction called Vice run by Julian (Willis).Julian created a world where anyone can go and live out their fantasies with artificials, free of the law and repercussions. Unfortunately some of these people drag this fantasy into the real world and this is why Roy is determined to shut the place down. It also seems as though it's mainly men act out these fantasies against the female artificials. Not sure if there is some allegory there about society or not. Maybe that line of thinking is too intelligent for this film, who knows though?Anyway, being based of Philip K Dick's novel, and this being a brainless cross of Westworld and Surrogates, we get a ghost in the machine, or more specifically, in Kelly (Childers). Kelly goes on the run...and runs, and runs, and runs....and is chased, and chased, and chased...through fake fog...and more fake fog...and you get the idea folks. The film is so slow-paced, despite it trying to excite with gun fights. Oh yes, the gun fights. I think all the bad guys are the same actors who play stormtroopers. Nuff said there.The plot is dire, the action is no better and neither is the direction. Willis dials his lines in (as he usually does these days) and Jane just seems to sleepwalk through it the best he can. Childers is passable with what she is given to work with. The only redeeming features are that the photography and production values are actually half-decent, but even those can't help balance what is a pretty bad and dull film. One to pass, unless you like seeing Willis turn up purely for a paycheck.
The Sage's Rating: 3/10"
" A cliched but still generally enjoyable movie.
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,6,Is it a low budget bastard child of westworld and Blade runner? Damned right it is. Is it a good Saturday afternoon time waster? You betcha.
" Limp performance by central actor sinks ship
",2019-12-01 00:00:00,3,"Just back from seeing VICE with a couple of friends.
Viewed at Cinestar multiplex, Berlin.
This is not a review but just some immediate reactions.
In short, over long, drawn out, discombobulated, baloney.
Really boring because the people described in it are all boring from the top down and what they have to say sounds like a college term paper being read out. Extremely uninteresting. Full of gimmicks like pretending to end the picture in the middle and running some final credits at that point. Or showing repeated closeups of a beating human heart that looks like a pile of raw liver. to underline the fact that the hero is undergoing a heart transplant as surgical hands fumble around in a bloody thoracic cavity. Pseudo documentary style with dates and description of events written on screen every ten minutes. But these inter-titles are more confusing than enlightening because the entire sequencing of the film is so jumbled and messy.The whole film with ragged time toggling back and forth is very confused, even when you are familiar with the events and the order in which they actually occurred. In Sum: I would have walked out halfway through if I hadn't been with friends. The private bedroom and bathroom life of the central couple, Amy Adams and Christian Bale, is more sickening than revealing of their private intimacy. Both are shown in badly lit full screen facial closeups over and over which emphasizes only their dullness. Almost the only memorable scene is when Bale does a full throat gargle with mouthwash in the bathroom while chatting with his wife. Arguably his most lively scene in the entire flick. This is supposed to be about a Vice president, Dick Cheney, who was so powerful that he relegated the president, George W. Bush, to the background in the wake of 9/11 when we are to believe that he took charge and plunged us into a series of dead-end wars. None of this potential power comes across from Bale's limp lifeless performance. He emanates weakness, not strength. The characters mulling around in the white house and other government offices got to be so dull that after a while it was a gigantic relief to see Richard Nixon in two brief closeups. His withdrawal from office speech on TV following Watergate actually brought the picture to life for a few seconds, which isn't saying much. One plus. Every scene that Sam Rockwell was in playing president George Bush was more or less watchable. The facial similarity was there and Rockwell played rings around Bale every time he was on. All in all an overweaning pretentious muddled mess that made me heave a sigh of relief when it finally did end after several phoney half baked endings. Much is made of Cheney's life long hobby of angle fishing and at the end we see a rather pretty sequence of colorful angling hooks and flies as if this were the secret key to Cheney's entire personality, like the Rosebud sled at the end of Citizen Kane. But Citizen Cheney is at least a light year away from Kane"
" Great premise, exciting movie
",2019-07-02 00:00:00,7,"What a fantastic premise! In a throwback to Total Recall, there's a company in the future that you can go to if you want to have an exhilarating experience with no consequences. Simply plug into the mental game, immerse yourself in the imaginary world, and do anything your heart desires. You can kill, cheat, steal, set fire to an orphanage, and have a drug-infested orgy, and when you're done, you unplug and return to the real world.Bruce Willis is the CEO of the very lucrative company, and he shares with the audience that everyone in the simulated world is a robot programmed to be a realistic person so his customers can have as realistic experience as possible. During one of the re-boots, where all the robots are repaired and their computer memories are wiped clean for the next customer, one robot Ambyr Childers gets skipped. She keeps her memories, and some of the things she's lived through are quite terrible to remember. As her memories come to her, she also starts to experience feelings. Is it possible she's turning human?Vice is a very exciting movie. With tons of action scenes, an intriguing story, likable characters, and a beautiful leading lady, what can go wrong? Male and female audiences will be enthralled, since it's not a typical manly action flick, so try it out for your next date night. If I liked it this much, and I normally shy away from futuristic settings, you're bound to!DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie will not be your friend. Some scenes include strobelights, swirling camera movements, or fast edits, and it will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to adult violence and sex scenes, I wouldn't let my kids watch it."
" my notes
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,1,"Terrible, just awful. copied off a bunch of other movies like surrogates, gamer, and the purge. shouldn't have been made. smh (1 viewing)"
" This is a modern Westworld that is even more shallow than Westworld for lack of plot development, character development, and ending...
",2019-05-30 00:00:00,3,"Not terrible, but not far from it. This is a Westworld remake, people pay big bucks to VICE to live out any fantasy with androids, called 'Artificials', that are mostly human with cloned skin and internal organs, etc. Just like Westworld, one of the units goes haywire and everything falls apart. The guards have the infinite ammo cheat as they fire thousands of rounds at the escaping Artificial, Childers, who is not hit, but the cop, Thomas Jane (Boy is he ugly! Aren't there any handsome leads in hollywood anymore?!?), takes out a dozen body armored guards with his pistol for the 'most of the movie' chase scene. Unfortunately there is hollywood propaganda about the anti-mililtray dark slant by how this technology is going to be used. It is a real shame to see how Bruce Willis has declined, physically, as well as an actor. He was listed as #4 on the credits... He is 'the face' of VICE and 90% of his shots are his chiseled, old, face on promos for VICE or being the 'hard' man that he is type cast as he directs underlings. Again, it is NOT terrible, this is a modern Westworld that is even more shallow than Westworld for lack of plot development, character development, and ending..."
" A great time-passer!
",2019-05-21 00:00:00,6,"Ok, starting off with the fact this has not won any Major Red Carpet accolades, I feel this movie may have the core values of ""entertainment"".
Albeit, more nudity could have peaked a higher interest; the action scenes did not disappoint!
Side-note: for ""trained"" armed security, I believe they couldn't hit water if they fell out of a boat. Why is that??? Most action movies could end with a few well placed shots by ""trained"" security...Plot line: decent. Stretching, but could be worse.
Actors: Willis, can't ever do wrong! Jane, batting .500, but always a fan. Childers, new fresh face. Should try and stick to movies with minimal lines.All in all, say thru it and wasn't highly disappointed! Give it a go!"
" Big city sci-fi thriller with Bruce Willis and Thomas Jane about artificial humans
",2019-05-04 00:00:00,6,"In the near future, a big city resort called Vice utilizes artificial humans wherein clients can fulfill their debased fantasies, including rape, robbery and murder. An artificial female (Ambyr Childers) escapes and seeks sanctuary at a city church. Bruce Willis plays the entrepreneur of the resort, Thomas Jane a disheveled cop who wants to put him out of business and Bryan Greenberg the man who resides in the church, but he ain't no pastor.""Vice"" (2015) mixes the concept of ""Westworld"" (1973) and ""Futureworld"" (1976) with elements of ""Blade Runner"" (1982), ""Groundhog Day"" (1993), ""Universal Soldier"" (1992) and ""The Island"" (2005). While it only cost $10 million and you can't expect blockbuster production values, it's more polished than the average SyFy flick, which usually only cost $3 million or less.Practically the entire movie takes place at nighttime in the big city and I like the reverent tone. Jane is great as the city cop and Willis is his reliable self in a role he could do in his sleep. Childers comes across as a low rent meshing of Malin Akerman and Alicia Silverstone, but in her mid-20s. She's a'right, but it would've been better with someone of the caliber of Scarlett Johannson or Silverstone when she was younger.What turned me off is the eye-rolling way the security guards at the resort couldn't hit the side of a barn; meanwhile the cop rarely misses. Sure, this is done in a lot in movies, but there's a way to do it that looks relatively realistic and doesn't insult the intelligence of the viewer. Not so here.""Vice"" thankfully shoots for some depth amidst its action thrills. For instance, there's the question of robotic self-awareness, which was explored with Data in Star Trek: The Next Generation. Then there's the debate over media violence & sex, whether in movies or video games. Does it provide an outlet for people to purge their debased desires or does it encourage that behavior in the real world? Lastly, there's a halfhearted commentary on religious fundamentalism and spirituality.While lackluster in some ways (due to its low-budget), I liked the reverent tone and the profundities amid the thrills, not to mention Jane's entertaining performance. It's marginally better than ""Westworld"" (1973), which, let's face it, wasn't exactly a masterpiece.The film runs 1 hour, 36 minutes and was shot in Mobile, Alabama, and Miami, Florida.GRADE: C+/B- (5.5/10)"
" Vice is a muddled low effort mess.
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,3,"Vice (2015) 3 out of 10: I often like low budget science fiction films. They are not afraid to take chances with the plot and to show their work. Since they cannot rely on expensive sets or special effects, they often need to have the science and the dialog carry the water for them. There are plenty of excellent examples with the recent film The Endless (2017) being a particularly good one.I also often like low budget exploitation films. They usually take more risks than their Hollywood brethren. They are not afraid to ""go there,"" and they seem to realize that if a scene is getting slow, a big orange fireball or some gratuitous nudity is the perfect thing to move the plot forward. The Cheerleaders (1973) is an excellent example of an exploitation film done right.Vice as a low budget reimagining of Westworld could have smoothly gone either route. Both the original movie and HBO's popular Westworld series have shown that exploitation and intelligent conversation, as well as high ideals, can stand side by side to create magnificent entertainment. Vice misses both smart sci-fi and good exploitation by a country mile.The Good: Filmed in Mobile Alabama to give it that future dystopian sheen I have to credit the location scouts and set designers. They did an excellent job with what they had.The Bad: Okay here we go. Let's start with our thespians.Thomas Jane plays a cop on the edge. He has long hair, a bad attitude, and is one more incident from losing his badge. Oh, and he walks around with an unlit match in his mouth. I am not sure if he was supposed to be Tango or Cash in this movie.Bruce Willis ups his sleepwalking game in Vice. Long considered the purveyor of some of the least exciting show up for the check roles in the business (At least Thomas Jane is channeling his inner Nicholas Cage) Willis seems particularly out of it in this movie. He does manage an irritated look from time to time, but that may have just been the realization he was stuck in Mobile, Alabama for another week.Ambyr Childers plays the escaped robot girl and is, in essence, the lead of the film. IMDB has her listed as an actress. I am thinking of sending in a correction. Seriously why would the producer of Vice hire an actress that has one expression and spends her entire time in an exploitation film dressed like she was going to a PTA meeting? What? Oh her husband produced the movie. Well, that explains a lot.Well, maybe the tight script and eye-opening story will save the day. I mean there are a lot of angles here. What makes a man? The exploitation of third world locations by first world tourists. Does committing violence in video games lead to more violence in real life? (The movie gives a solid yes to the third one by the way in a groaner soliloquy given by Thomas Jane.)The script is brainless and lacks imagination. Almost criminally so. Let us start with the brainless part. There is a scene where our escaped lady robot (Ambyr Childers) hides out in a church. She is unknowingly wearing a tracking device in the form of a bracelet. She is programmed not to see the tracking bracelet. A particular scientist at the church (which she dreamed off BTW that is how she got here) takes off the tracking bracelet with a unique tool so the bad guys cannot track her. They then spend the rest of the night at the church until the bad guys show up.Let us break that down. Why would you make a tracking bracelet and go to all the trouble of programming the robot not to see it? It's a robot you built. You could put the tracking device internally in the robot. Second, if you are going to remove the tracking device the next step is to have the tracking device lead your adversaries away from you (put in the back of moving vehicle, tie to a rats tail ext) or for you to move away from the tracking device. It is not to hang out in the last known location after removing said device. Removing a tracking device while on the run is a simple trope. I have never seen a film get it wrong until now.As for the imagination part, the Westworld in this film is just a dance club, a sex club, and a fern bar. In other worlds an overpriced brothel with robot woman. That is it? Who would go to this for more than an hour or two? The movie promotes that because the robots are well robots, you can kill and rape them. I think that there is, in reality, a thankfully limited clientele for this sort of thing. Like the movie A.I., it comes down to the fact the robots are still robots. At some point, you are going to Konmari them or trade them in for a newer model. Anyway, the so-called dream vacation place looks like the kind of club you nope out of after a few drinks, sex robots or no sex robots.The Ugly: Well a robot sex club still sounds like a reasonable basis for a fun exploitation movie right? It does, and it should be. Vice despite its name lacks well vice. There is one bit of toplessness in the entire film from a woman whose breast implants are so bad it makes me realize the futility of an artificial woman as a concept. Most of the gunfights are from the Stormtrooper school of marksmanship. The advertised debauchery barely exists and when it does it looks like a take back the night video done by the HR department.In Conclusion: Vice is a muddled low effort mess. It fails as a science fiction film, and it fails as a sexploitation film but most of all it fails as an enjoyable film."
" NO LAWS NO RULES
",2018-11-26 00:00:00,8,"This is a bad film that I liked. Julian Michaels (Bruce Willis) has created a ""West World"" called ""Vice"" a city where there are no laws and no rules. People pay money to go there and act out their fantasies. Unfortunately it attracts low life clientele who then take their illegal fantasies to the real world. Scruffy Detective Roy ( Thomas Jane) wants to shut the place down, while his captain wants to maintain it due to the enormous tax revenue it brings in to the city. Vice has players known as ""Artificials."" They are ""people"" with artificial parts and memory using cloned tissue. They have emotions and act real. Their memory is in a loop and they live their lives like ""Groundhog's Day"" with different people beating them up, killing and raping them every night. The real action and twists starts when Kelly (Ambyr Childers) one of the Artificials malfunctions and escapes to the real world.So the acting wasn't that great. The film has cult appeal. The security guards are from ""The Gang that Couldn't Shoot Straight"" always missing their main target and always hitting innocent bystanders even using that little red laser sight thing. The film is slightly futuristic, but not terribly so. It is a good escape film.Guide: F-bombs. Brief sex. Stripper nudity."
" Constantly fails to impress
",2018-11-04 00:00:00,3,"VICE is another cheap and digital thriller with a plot that openly copies that of WESTWORLD. It's largely constrained in style, limited to tired-looking actors reciting trite dialogue and running around corridors and buildings with their weapons drawn. The story is about a kind of virtual reality game where contestants can show up and shoot people, or rather virtual people. Bruce Willis has a tiny role as the theme park boss while Thomas Janes gets a surprisingly small amount of screen time as the cop hero. Sadly, this film is entirely let down by awful visuals and dark action scenes which constantly fail to impress."
" More artificial than wild
",2018-10-23 00:00:00,1,"Saw 'Vice' because Bruce Willis has done good films and given good performances in the past and the idea for the story sounded interesting. Expectations were not high though, because Willis has been past prime for a while (several bad films and has looked tired and disengaged a lot) and having disliked his other outings with director Brian A.Miller, especially 'Reprisal'.'Vice' is not a good representation of him, as a film it is down there as one of his worst and his own performance likewise. It fails dismally, faring very unfavourably in relation to other films seen in the genre, and while the idea was great 'Vice' manages to portray it with no thrills or imagination, complete with dull pacing, lots of silliness and endless predictability. Not hating it with pleasure, it's my honest opinion and my negative feelings towards it are regrettable.Willis is used poorly, looks tired and like he didn't want to be there. Jonathan Schaech is stuck in a one-dimensional role that he overdoes in some places and underacts in others. They are nothing though next to a completely charisma free Thomas Jane spending the whole time looking completely disinterested and like he had not slept in days.Visually, 'Vice' looks amateurish, the photography here some of the most disorganised, least stylish and self-indulgent for any film seen recently and the editing lacks cohesion. The music is too loud, should have been used far less and some of the placement is inappropriate. Brian A. Miller's direction is similar to that of an inexperienced rookie to the job, no personality and a lot of chaos and dullness.Dialogue from the very start to the contrived climax is riddled with clichés and cheese and what little there is of the story has no surprises, fun or tension, is very pedestrian in pace and fails to make sense or have signs of maturity. It is good that it didn't take itself too seriously but 'Vice' goes overboard on the ridiculousness and lack of plausibility. The action is clumsily choreographed, sloppily edited and not exciting or suspenseful at all, as well as looking at least twenty years out of date. The characters are not compelling or easy to get behind. Do not expect every character in every film to be likeable when characters in numerous films purposefully aren't, but it is an issue if there are characters meant to be rootable and 'Vice' has that problem.On the whole, awful. 1/10 Bethany Cox"
" Not that bad at all
",2018-08-30 00:00:00,6,"Not sure why rated so low. Sure enough it is not a top movie, but action scenes are good. Plot is ok but not very believable and it has some similarities with the popular West World.
Acting seemed ok to me and if your expectations are not too high, you can have an entertaining time."
" Waste of a good plot.
",2018-04-08 00:00:00,3,"There needs to be a framework with somewhat believable events to make pretend Hollywood movies worth watching. That was this movie's main fail, a classic example of lazy.Perhaps it would help if villains could actually hit what they shoot hundreds of rounds at. These villains should have been on villain unemployment. A good villain wouild get the rabbit in one or two shots. The rabbit would most assuredly have been taken down on the first grenade strike, they all actually hit close enough to be lethal or near lethal, though she got away just fine.Perhaps it would help if people died like they really would in real life (more on that later). Getting hit multiple times from full auto does not facilitate the villain dancing-jittering on his feet in place as the dozen or so rounds strike him. There is momentum, the round's momentum striking a solid object drives it back (not counting solid bone breaking). But then like magic and only after the last round ques him to fall down dead, he does so with no apparent exist holes with blood and bone-flesh fragments.We all know Hollywood is the world of fake. But at least it should try to be entertaining and true to life. Fake is the problem in real life, fake dulls some in the public to think shooting people isn't that bad.I feel Hollywood and entertainment is a very real contributor to the festering component of violence and death in real life on our city's streets. The actors who portray gun violence to millions of our youth then climb onto the anti-2nd bandwagon in real life are an odorous seething pile, a stench. One actor is now in the process of moving his family to Australia because he feels all butt hurt who the POSTUS is. Wow, what a childish mind. Yet blood is on his hands by him killing many people on the silver screen. Blood money is in his pocket, blood money spent on his family.... Yet he fights the 2nd amendment.... That is Hollywood ilk for ya."
" How hard is it to follow a plausible timeline?
",2018-03-27 00:00:00,1,"Yeah the story already is unappealing. But than again, there is a story for everything. Shouldn't have to be bad. But than half way in you find out that everything has been build up in not even five years time you lose me. Just cannot grab my mind you would go through all the trouble of making a movie and screw up such an trivial thing.Yes all the other point other reviewers are true too. It simply is just that bad. No respect for the audience."
" Dumb Westworld
",2018-03-03 00:00:00,1,"While this movie came out before Westworld the hbo series, the similarities were striking. Enough for me to presume that the hbo series has more in common with the 1973 movie than I would've suspected. Since I haven't seen the 1973 movie yet, I can't determine just how much alike they are.A lot of elements from this movie are similar enough to the hbo series (a single female android inexplicably remembers their past iterations, has memories of a building she's never seen before, and violence committed against them, wakes up during repair, escapes, causes all the other androids to remember and turn against their handlers) to be intriguing, but the intrigue essentially ends there.
While Westworld was a big huge place devoted to vice and violence and the like, the place here in ""Vice"" is essentially limited to a sleazy-looking upscale bordello or hotel. ""Cheap and tawdry"" best defines the place, as well as the entire aura and tone of the film.
Once the female android Kelly escapes, she ends up drawn to a church building, the same one she inexplicably remembered earlier, despite never being there. There she inexplicably finds the original designer of the robots, a guy who is inexplicably young and sexy and who apparently designed Kelly to look just like his dead wife, using his dead wife's DNA.
All the while, Thomas Jane, who deserves better than this film, is a cop who is inexplicably in trouble for executing an arrest warrant inside the cheap and tawdry Westworld, and is inexplicably suspended from the police force for investigating an alleged ""explosion"" which is used as a cover story for Kelly's escape in which she killed some employees there. Despite having compelling evidence to at least investigate the supposed explosion, the police chief suspends him and forbids him from investigating further.
Some manner of corrupt intrigue between the police and Cheap and Tawdry Westworld's owner, Julian Michaels (Bruce Willis in a pointless role) is briefly implied, but subsequently dropped and never mentioned again. The fact that Julian Michaels apparently has his own para-military police force with the latest in military technology weaponry is another pretty major ""This should be more important than a runaway android"" plot point that is subsequently completely ignored and forgotten.
The vast majority of the film apart from the setup is basically just chases, with Thomas Jane (who deserves better) thrown in for a laugh. Despite making their escape, Kelly decides she wants to free all the other androids by uploading a program into the Cheap and Tawdry Westworld's systems that will let them all remember everything that ever happened to them.
This succeeds, and the androids mercifully decide not to kill everyone or something. Honestly I completely forgot everything about this movie's ending.
Apart from the Westworld connection, other reviewers have mentioned just how bad most of the acting is. The writing and the way the film treats things like police procedure, detective-talk, and the fact that a private businessman has his own private army wandering around the city getting into massive gunfights that result in civilian casualties is treated like it's not a Big Effing Deal far worse than anything involving Cheap and Tawdry Westworld. 
It's written like a teenager whose sole experience with this manner of ""adult stuff"" is video games like Grand Theft Auto and dumb cop movies where big noisy guns and ""ungh sexy chicks hot babes unhh makin fat stacks of cash"" is more important and relevant than the fact that a random business asshole has a PRIVATE MILITARY FORCE engaging in shootouts on the streets resulting in civilian casualties and this almost never even comes up at police headquarters beyond an extremely brief ""investigation"" which is almost immediately forgotten and dropped to focus on ""an android ran away"""
" Vice, a pretty good film!
",2017-08-12 00:00:00,10,I was looking for a good film to watch on Netflix. I was baffled by all the negative reviews at IMDb and elsewhere. I thought the film was fast paced and clever. I think the movie was a 10 and I recommend it to all. Bruce Willis was good and all the acting was good and believable. I enjoyed this movie from beginning to the end.
" Awful movie
",2017-07-07 00:00:00,1,"I only started to watch this film because of Bruce Willis, one of my favorite actors. I gave it up after 20 minutes. It's a terrible film with amateurish acting and story line. I guess Bruce needs the money to get involved in something this embarrassing. Usually I can watch even bad sci-fi flics just for the imaginative ideas but this one was so bad I couldn't sit through it."
" supposedly intelligent people commit violent crimes for no apparent reason
",2017-06-07 00:00:00,3,"I'm checking the ""spoiler"" box, but nothing I say here is a surprise if you've ever seen an action movie before in your life.This movie had some potential. It brought up some serious issues: If people could act out their most evil fantasies -- rape and murder and so on -- in a way that no real person is harmed, would they then ""get it out of their system"" and be less likely to harm anyone in real life, or would they want bigger and bigger thrills and be more likely to harm someone in real life? The analogy to violent video games is obvious. If people created artificially intelligent robots, at what point should these robots be considered ""people"" with human rights? That one's been done before but they could have brought new thoughts to the table.But instead the movie very quickly devolves into one of those action movies where the violence doesn't even make sense. I can believe a story where poor and oppressed people with nothing to lose engage in desperate violence. I can believe a story where an intelligent person with wealth and status hatches a carefully-planned criminal plot. But I have a hard time believing a story where a supposedly intelligent person with wealth and status commits violent crimes with some lip service about protecting his wealth and status but where anyone with an IQ of 20 would realize that he has far more to lose by committing these crimes than any of his other problems. I'm sure a skilled writer could make the story believable by showing the rich person getting more and more desperate as things go against him, let us see his growing paranoia or whatever until he snaps. But there was zero attempt to explain the villain's totally irrational behavior here.In ""Vice"", there's a resort where, presumably for a large fee, people can act out their worst fantasies on robots, ""killing"" them, ""raping"" them, etc. Then one of the robots breaks out of its programming and escapes. At that point, absolutely zero harm has been done. As far as anyone in the world of this movie is concerned, it's the moral equivalent of an auto mechanic having a car roll out of the shop and into the street. In the case of the car or the robot, you'd have someone run out to get it back. If it did some damage or harmed someone, your insurance company pays up, and that would be the end of it. But in the movie, the owner of the resort sends armed men out to kill anyone who has seen the robot. They have a shoot-out with the police. How could he possibly expect to get away with this? Is his company such a bunch of yes-men that absolutely no one says, ""Umm, before we become involved in a conspiracy to murder police officers, why don't we just call the authorities and tell them that one of our robots is malfunctioning and could they please help us track it down?"" Then the hero, a police officer, decides he's going to destroy the resort. He gets a computer hacker friend to sabotage the robots so they start killing the guests of the resort. He then breaks in with a machine gun and starts shooting all the employees. Now I'm no legal expert, but no matter what crimes the owner of a company commits, I'm pretty sure the police are not allowed to go to his office and start killing all his employees and customers.The other illogic is barely worth mentioning. Like they have a tracking device on the robot. At one point someone disables the tracking device for her. Then they stay in the building where he disabled the tracking device for what appears to be hours. Despite the fact that she is in the exact same place where the tracking device last registered her, the villain doesn't have the vaguest idea where she is or where to start looking, until he gets a clue from a totally unrelated source. Because the tracking device is disabled."
" great action movie
",2017-05-30 00:00:00,7,First of all I would like to say that because of the reviews from2015 I put off this movie for so long until tonight and I just have to point out that the reviews are wrong I wish this movie was a little longer then 1hour and 42 but it still manages to delver and keep you holding on to your seat the action is well done kinda reminds me of good day to die hard the story is nothing new about a robot woman who starts getting her memory back of everything that happened to her and the company doing everything in there power to get her back one of the complainants wad of the special effects and how they look childish but as i was going through the film there was nothing like that at all another complaint was of how Bruce Willis only did this movie because of a favour he I also heard of how the action was bad but i have seen a lot of worse like hamlet 2017 or attack of the killer doughnuts I think people are just mad because Bruce Willis was only in it for like maybe 10 minutes or they just didn't find this movie realistic if you want a fast pacing good story well acted movie go see this and do not go for the 1 star reviews
" Interesting premise that wasn't really explored.
",2017-05-16 00:00:00,7,"This is not a West world remake. It brings up several interesting topics such as whether sentient AI is alive or merely a very good imitation of life. The idea of being unleashed in a world where one can do anything and everything is another element brought up, but none of these are really explored. The action is believable generally though not exceptional. The acting mostly solid. It's not a B flick, but not a blockbuster either. Entertaining but this movie missed it's potential to be deep or interesting. Far too much screen time was spent on trivia and not enough exploring the ideas. Not enough action to make it a mindless action flick. The biggest liability was the typical Hollywood clichés. If Willis had been unleashed as a character rather than a 2D villain it'd made for a much more interesting movie. The detective just comes off as annoying and PC in a really odd way. There is some mild preaching going on that just distracts rather than enhances the movie and takes away from the plot exploration. It is also psychologically unsound, as psychology studies have shown that violent outlets such as video games actually decrease rather than increase violent tendencies and serve as a healthy outlet for preexisting drives rather than inspiring them. Overall this is a movie worth watching but not one to write home about. It could have been a really great movie and that is the real shame."
" Make up on women
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,9,"Why do movies always have women wearing heavy not smudged or smeared makeup, like in this movie, or appearing to have makeup on when getting out of bed in the morning? Otherwise I really like this movie!Lots of action, moves along well.Lots of focus on sex and exploiting women - which I don't like."
